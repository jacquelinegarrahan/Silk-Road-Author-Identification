				The best place to go for reviews of bitcoin service providers is bitcointalk.org. Just Googling &quot;torwallet&quot; you&#039;ll find a bunch of threads from bitcointalk.org where people were saying they couldn&#039;t withdraw their coins from Torwallet.

I hope you have better luck in future; always research the companies / entities you&#039;re doing business with on the internet and never risk more than you can afford to lose.<br /><br />Throw me a Bitcoin address / your SR username and I&#039;ll send you a coin. It&#039;s not much and it won&#039;t take the sting out of your loss, but it&#039;s something!<br /><br />- grahamgreene
