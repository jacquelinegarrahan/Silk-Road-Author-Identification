				Actually the real scam risk is to the sellers. Buyer orders from a few diff accnts, doesn&#039;t confirm delivery...seller most likely might get something in resolution but still...<br /><br />you receive, then you pay. <br /><br />One-off accounts? Escrow is a thrid party, nobody get&#039;s paid until the buyer confirms delivery. Even if they set-up a bunch of fake accounts (why?) still someone would have to click on them add to cart and click shipment received....that&#039;s the beauty of SR and the escrow system. It shocks people when they finally get it! It protects buyers and sellers. There are a few reverse scammers but for the most part its amazingly smooth...

				Quantum&#039;s right, buyer&#039;s have a far easier way to scam by simply claiming they never received the goods.<br /><br />Supposedly this is offset by the fact that buyers are exposing themselves by revealing their address, but I still would feel more comfortable if buyers had a way of earning trust points and getting reviews as well.&nbsp; Personally I wont do any large transactions with new sellers until I have had a few good transactions with them first, or if they can get another reputable seller to vouch for them

				Brand new seller is likely to have to take a while to get established anyway...anybody who doesn&#039;t already have a good rep, and I check what kind of points and stuff they are, probably won&#039;t have much luck anyway...they gotta start small, or nobody will buy...and every once in a while, somebody&#039;ll get bit, happens every day...but those who hang in, will get to know who&#039;s who...the baddies who want quick money will be on sites w/no escrow...and if it&#039;s a new seller, always start by buying small, and let others know, so a bunch don&#039;t buy from first timer.&nbsp; Once I get a good seller, I always check them first...

				Seller registration has been closed for a few days, apparently, though buyers can still register. This is sad for us who registered this week! I imagine this happened because the scenario where someone can register a bunch of accounts and conduct a bunch of fake transactions between them to grant oneself positive feedback is possible, allowing a scammer to produce a large number of seemingly reputable sellers who can claim to send their items and hope to get a share of the escrowed payment. I don&#039;t know how this will be fixed.

				So if something goes wrong escrow will split it 50/50, i dont see how someone couldnt make some bank doing that enough through enough bs accounts.

				All sites have risks: SR has eliminated as many as possible, and continues to improvise...it&#039;s all in our favor...the fly by nite scam artists won&#039;t last.&nbsp; New sellers just need to start small, not make crazy claims, and post their GPG keys...the longer it goes, the better he sellers who act rite will look...
