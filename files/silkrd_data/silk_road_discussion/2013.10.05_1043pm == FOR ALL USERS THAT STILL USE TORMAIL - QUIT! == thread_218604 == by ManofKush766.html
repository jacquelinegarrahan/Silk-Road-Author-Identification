				Is tormail not gone for the last couple months???<br /><br />Anyone who accesses CP deserves everything they get the dirty fucks! Personally, if I was in control of the punishment i&#039;d have them tortured to death.

				Between this thread, the Sheep site theory because it&#039;s new and possibly a setup net to catch people, the new SR possibility to stay away from, to changing passwords on here and any new site signed up to, to this forum being now owned by the law theory, to Java settings, to weird untrustworthy messages people are receiving, to conspiracy theories of how SR was broken down to me now getting more paranoid than I ever was even when all was running OK on the road, I have to say, I don&#039;t give a fuck!!! Ha Ha!<br /><br />But on a serious note because that&#039;s how it all is now at the mo., my paranoia levels are sky high and I can&#039;t help my mind from going at a high rate of thinking about all I&#039;ve done and whether or not I&#039;m open to being caught!<br /><br />Better safe than sorry I suppose or in this case better more paranoid than sorry!<br /><br />I&#039;m a firm believer in being more over the top even when not needed regarding safety than letting slip for even half a second!!!

Tormail has been gone for over 2 months now (in August -- the time you&#039;re referring to). It was hosted on Freedom Hosting&#039;s servers and went down when they were taken offline by LE, which is the only reason that they would have been subject to search. As far as I know, LE didn&#039;t have access to the US based servers (the servers that were seized in Russia a very long time ago might be a different story, but that&#039;s a long and unrelated story). They took down the Freedom Hosting servers (which I think were in Ireland) in an international sting because it was one of the largest hosters of CP content. They took out a lot of .onion sites that weren&#039;t CP related in the process. The FBI was controlling their servers and used exploits in TorBrowser/Firefox to locate the servers. People have much worse things to worry about than tormail at this point.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=218604.msg1592235#msg1592235">Quote from: ManofKush766 on October 05, 2013, 10:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">With this said, I have seen many SR users STILL using Tormail, for your safety&#039;s sake, I would recommend not to use it.

Nobody&#039;s security or personal information is safe anymore.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>SR has been gone for almost a week. There are no more SR users. A lot of us were using tormail address in the email field of our GPG keys, which is why no one bothered to change them. Some of the addresses that I used when creating my keys were old tormail accounts that I didn&#039;t even know the password to anymore, and others were addresses that I made up. <br /><br />With that said, if you&#039;re using tormail for security reasons (i.e. anonymity), you&#039;d probably be careful not to store any unencrypted personal information in that account that could be used to identify you (at least if your smart that is). And some vendors probably had old tormail addresses on their profiles that they never bothered to change.<br /><br />I understand why people are concerned, but the level of paranoia in these forums is waaaaaay out of hand.
