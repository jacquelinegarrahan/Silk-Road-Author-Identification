				I remember being able to view my Seller Stats and how much I&#039;ve sold in BTC (and maybe USD too). Basically I will have been a vendor for 6 weeks in about a week and I am seeing if I&#039;ve met the requirements to get my bond back. I know the requirements are: Be a vendor for 6 weeks, have over 30 successful transactions, and have sold $1500+. I believe I have met all the requirements except the 6 weeks, but I just want to make sure I&#039;ve sold over 1500.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

If you wish to calculate if you&#039;ve achieved the required $1500 for access to &#039;The Roundtable&#039; you can do so from your account history (you&#039;ll be able to view six weeks of records, older records are automatically deleted), which you can access by clicking on account ฿-.-- (-.-- your Bitcoin amount here) &gt; Account history. Hope this helps you :)
