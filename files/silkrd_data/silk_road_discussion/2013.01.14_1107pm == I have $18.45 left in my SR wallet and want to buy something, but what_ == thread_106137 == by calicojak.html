				Any vendors offering samples or something? What the hell can I get with $18.45? That would need to include shipping aswell. I&#039;m located in the US. Thanks<br /><br />PS...I&#039;m not looking for a handout, I&#039;d be willing to pay for the sample, don&#039;t need no free shit, plus I&#039;ll do a complete review. I have perfect stats btw.

				I promise I won&#039;t send an empy letter. I just had to add that little bit there because it made me laugh. I have plenty of left overs from 2012 and what I have in my spare stash is worth significantly north of $20. I will leave the listing up if you change your mind :)

				18.45 BTC!!! That&#039;s a crazy amount :D<br /><br />I would probably just buy Girl Scout Cookies (and lots of it :) )<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried shrooms, so if I had the money, I&#039;d probably dabble in that a bit.

				Funny that you made a thread. I&#039;ve been searching for an hour or so on how to spend the $16.66 I have left in my SR wallet after today&#039;s orders&nbsp; Best thing I can find is half a gram of hash from Jimmy Neuchron. Something about it turns me off though. Back to searching, I&#039;ll let you know if I find anything else.
