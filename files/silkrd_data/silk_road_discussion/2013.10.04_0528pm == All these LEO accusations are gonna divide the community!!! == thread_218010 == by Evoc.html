				Ok, we&#039;re all hearing this guy is LEO and this guy is LEO and so on but for gods sake, what is the point in making those threads unless you have solid evidence to back up your claims???<br /><br />Things like this is hurting the community as a whole and aside from the shutdown of SR, this is the next single most thing that will screw things up for all.<br /><br />It is killing confidence of trust among all users of these forums and if you feel you have a concern about a certain member, moderator or whatever; isn&#039;t it best to speak to them directly with your opinion rather than starting a new thread spreading paranoia amongst everyone?<br /><br /><br />~~~~As for people on about the location of this Agent Tarbell~~~~~<br /><br />I personally wouldn&#039;t give 2 shits if he was ran over by a truck as i&#039;ve no respect for anyone who works for the feds or any other affiliated organization&nbsp; but the significance of DPR&#039;s concerns about the person who was threatening the anonymity was to PREVENT the leak of information regarding what went on on SR and to be honest, I understand his thought process but unfortunately he was being screwed over in a very discreet manner.<br /><br />So basically, anything that was to happen to Tarbell at this stage would be of absolutely no significance to anyone as the damage is already done!<br /><br />(Just waiting for the next thread now &quot;Evoc is LEO&quot;)<br /><br /><br />Peace out,<br />Evoc
