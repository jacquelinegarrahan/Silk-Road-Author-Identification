				Me too: mcgillacuddy came thru fine, and I clicked &#039;finalize&#039; and ... that was it...nothing happened...bummer about feedback, but bigger worry is: Were Funds Released From Escrow!?!<br /><br />Probably LE has taken over, and they still don&#039;t understand btc...bt *what!?*&nbsp; Feedback?&nbsp; Means returning for 2nd lunch...officer.<br /><br />shit.

				I just had the same problem 10 minutes ago. After sending the seller a message letting him know I could not rate or leave feedback, I went back into my account and the option for leaving feedback was there and it worked. I think there is some kind of bug on the server beside the feedback issue. I was viewing all the listing for weed and each one I went into said &quot;no listing for this item&quot;. Anyone else notice this?

				Probably has something to do with the recent server updates. I&#039;ve noticed that you can now edit old feedbacks and delete sent PM&#039;s which I couldn&#039;t do before.

				Seems back up I just got some FB but there were @least 3 orders that couldn&#039;t leave it. Also the &quot;total transactions&quot; number isn&#039;t logging the orders that couldn&#039;t leave FB it seems. The completed transactions log is also important! The funds were released, just hope customer&#039;s have an opportunity to leave fb later. <br /><br />I know you can now edit the feedback you&#039;ve left people so maybe you can do it that way?

				Under your account tab at this page:<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/account<br /><br />There should be a Feedback button, where you can leave feedback and CHANGE feedback you have left for others.
