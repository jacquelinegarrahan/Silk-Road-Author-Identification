				Easy fellow hedonists...<br /><br />Ive recently signed up to SR and by poking around for abit ive got a pretty good understanding of how things work but have come up against a wall when it comes to buying Bitcoins. Im in the UK and have heard that recently its become pretty difficult for UK users to buy bitcoins due to several banks no longer woring money or something like that?<br />But there must be a way round this because i see plently of UK buyers and vendors.<br /><br />Is anyone kind enough to help a brother out and point me in the right direction for buying some bitcoins? Is the only way round this problem by buying the coins off of another member? Obviously i know its not possible to buy BTC with a credit or debit card due to anonymity.. so how else is it possible? Paypal? <br /><br />Cheers guys, il be waiting patiently for someones help :))

				I&#039;m pretty new myself, but you could try localbitcoins.com.&nbsp; Find a bitcoin dealer local to you, check their rating looks ok and place an order. You can then send a private message to the vendor to ask about method of payment. <br /><br />You could buy openly by bank transfer then &#039;launder&#039; the bitcoins through various wallets or fogging services (depending on level of paranoia). Or you could meet the dealer in person and hand over cash (the BTC are kept in escrow, but the dealer can release them using their mobile, which triggers a message (and secret passphrase) being sent to you to confirm the BTC are yours.)&nbsp; The latter method means there won&#039;t be an electronic link between you and the coins.

				Blockchain.info is how I usually get mine, using the pingit service.<br /><br />Also, check on here for sellers:<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0

				I was literally in the same position as you, until yesterday. I too can vouch for localbitcoins.com<br />The guy I bought them off, BTCDiscreet provided a great service. From me first applying for them, to them being in my SR account, I think took about 25 minutes.<br />Will use again. If you need help learning how to use it let me know :)<br /><br />

				Oh, and please do not be drawn into the forums posts that are being spammed currently, like &#039;Official BTC Shop 10 bitcoin=$73.65 www.bitcointalks.com 1 bitcoin=$10.88 5 bitc New&#039;. They&#039;re trying to cash in on people in your sort of situation, it is a scam :)

				Is localbitcoins a UK only thing?&nbsp; I still have plenty of trouble getting BTC in the US.&nbsp; Mainly because I&#039;m lazy and just not crazy about the idea of running to CVS or Walmart with a handful of cash to buy my BTC.

				BTCxUK has had some good feedback from members on here.<br /><br />Their (barebones) website: http://64d7qoqgjcw47vvz.onion/<br />BTCxUK discussion I started the other day: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83535.0<br /><br />I like that they use an &quot;.onion&quot; address and only wanted to be contacted through Tormail. I think it&#039;s quite obvious they know where their bitcoins are often being spent.<br /><br />In fact, MrCronk on SR has put a link to them on his profile.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t bought anything from them yet myself. I sent them an email about 4.5 hours ago but haven&#039;t had a reply... but I&#039;ll let them off, it&#039;s a Saturday.<br /><br />&quot;Btc Faucet&quot; seems like a good option on localbitcoins too.
