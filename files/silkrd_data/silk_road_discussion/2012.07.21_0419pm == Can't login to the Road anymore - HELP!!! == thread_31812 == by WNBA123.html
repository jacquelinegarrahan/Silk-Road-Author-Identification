				Hello, this has happened a few times in the last week for me, i just had to shut Tor/laptop down and restart. Have a look through the forums im sure there was a post about this a couple of days ago also if your using a mac make sure the time is set right, sounds silly but that worked for me.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Thank god for this post. I thought it was just me. I too have been trying to log in for 6 weeks and it has not been letting me. I think there is a bug. I bought a brand new computer and it seems to work.<br /><br />But I had to buy this computer in make up so they couldn&#039;t recognize me. Everyone knows if you buy a brand new laptop from best buy with cash they know you are using it for Silk Road. PAYING CASH FOR YOUR COMPUTER IS A BIG TIP OFF THAT YOUR A VENDOR ON SILK ROAD!<br /><br />BE CAREFUL.<br /><br />AND NEVER EVERY BUY A COMPUTER FROM APPLE OR FROM AN ONLINE RETAILER. EVERYONE KNOWS THEY TRACK ALL THE COMPUTERS THEY SELL TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT USING TOR.<br /><br />THEY ARE BUILDING A 11 BILLION SQUARE FOOT BUILDING IN UTAH TO TRACK ALL SILK ROAD USERS.<br /><br />BETTER SAFE THEN SORRY...

				LOL... No I was just trying to fit in with the 80% of posters ;D<br /><br />It was sarcasm and I wanted people that post this shit to see how crazy it sounds. Everything I posted has actually been posted. And yes there are plenty of trolls that do it. And most of them are members that create a second or third account. But there are also TONS of hero members and the like that post this shit.<br /><br />As I have said in another thread, this is an open forum and I know this is not going to stop and some of it is actually good. It&#039;s great people disagree and have different views. I just wanted to point out that it does not need to be done on every little thing that happens.<br /><br />Everyone&nbsp; of us realizes we do illegal shit and we can get in trouble. We all know there will one day be someone that gets in trouble because of SR and that one day the paranoid people will be right. But so far they are 0 for 10000.
