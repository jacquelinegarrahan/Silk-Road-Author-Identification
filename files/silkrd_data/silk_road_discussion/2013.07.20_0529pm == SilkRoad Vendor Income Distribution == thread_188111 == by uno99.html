				SR Unofficial Census thread? :-)<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m interested in alot of the census figures for stuff on SR. Obviously there are things that can and can&#039;t be obtained without relying on estimation. But I wanted to see what your thoughts on some figures were. <br /><br />There are alot of figures that I&#039;d be interested in knowing, but I think the most interesting and fun out of the figures is the age old &quot;So how much you think he&#039;s making // Celebrity Networth.com question&quot; <br /><br />SO that being said...How do you think income is distributed among vendors for these sales figures. We already have information on so and so vendor being in the top X% of Silk Road vendors, but how do you think that correlates with income?<br /><br />**Note we are using BEFORE TAX INCOME not SALES** While I think both can be reasonable and fun to estimate, I picked it because ultimately its the more descriptive statistic (esp at the lower levels) and decided to stick with it...despite the SilkRoad top % Statistic being based on Sales and therefore correlating better to this as well as being easier to estimate**<br /><br />Key:<br /><br />$1,000,000+<br />$450,000-$999,999<br />$250,000-$450,000<br />$125,000-$250,000<br />$85,000-$125,000<br />$60,000-$85-000<br />$45,000-$60,000<br />$35,000-$45,000<br />$25,000-$35,000<br />$15,000-$25,000<br />$10,000-$15,000<br />Less than $10,000 <br /><br />ex. respond by matching the quartile to the percent of vendors you believe fit the criteria. <br />1%, 25%, 50%, etc. If you think only 0.01% (1/10000) vendors is taking home $1,000,000, then put 0.01% next to the $1,000,000+ option.<br /><br />Curious to hear responses.<br /><br />

				Yea, I didn&#039;t expect vendors to be comfortable with revealing that info. I guess what I was hoping for was for alot of the small-mid scale vendors out there to take guesses on what kind of money their lesser or higher up peers were bringing in. Yeah, even with that, I think you are right in that its alott of guess work and also that people will remain hesistant. But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s farfetched to think that a person on the bottom rung of that table I would answer a &quot;(I think maybe 1 guy or 2 guys maybe &quot;HAndle1&quot; and &quot;Handle2&quot; make this much, couple guys make this much, and the majority make this much)&quot; type of answer...which I think is really non-invasive and reasonable to opine on...not to mention interesting conversation.<br /><br />I wanted to create the thread because among all of the other demographic stats that people might be interested in, this one is probably one of the ones that most people would be most interested in knowing despite the reservations you mentioned.

				You can estimate a vendor&#039;s gross revenue by counting how many feedback they get in a month for each of their products.

I do this as well and I would imagine most of the people who browse silkroad. <br /><br />It&#039;s different from having a % Distribution that accounts for the rich, poor, the mid level guys, as well as the experimental sellers though which is what I wanted. I hoped people would respond more readily. I think people are interested in the topic, as the views seem to go up at an ok pace for the number of replies, but as the guy who posted mentioned people seem hesistant/not interested in doing the estimation.
