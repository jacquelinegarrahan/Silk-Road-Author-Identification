				Ok here is the deal. I would love to order some things off from here. Well a lot of stuff. But the problem I&nbsp; have is that I do not like the idea of it being sent to my house like people suggest. What I would like to know is why is it that most people say it needs to be sent there? Why wouldn&#039;t it be better if I set up a p.o. box in a fake name that has a street address for it? Wouldn&#039;t it be just the same since it has a street address rather than a P.O. Box address? Also If I do end up sending the stuff to my house I understand it has a very high percentage of delivery. But the ones that get caught in the mail what happens to the people? Is it that no one knows because they are in jail? Also if nothing does happen that worries me as well. How is it that you get a ounce of cocaine caught in the mail and just nothing happen? Please help me out people. Facts and things i can look up would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!! :-\

				The knowledge you seek has been posted many times over. Try the security sub forum and search for noob guides. I cannot spoon feed you information but would gladly help when you have spent the time to learn the basics, do not rush an order as it is your security &amp; freedom you are playing with.

				OP:&nbsp; wsg has given you very, very sound advice.&nbsp; <br />Please do not rush into a transaction!&nbsp; <br />Please take the time to learn how to encrypt your address to vendors using PGP if you want to stay out of jail.&nbsp; <br />Like wsg, I will help you once you have learned the basics - I will help you practice PGP, just send me a private message (PM) when you think you have it figured out. <br />Most of us spent days, weeks &amp; months learning how to do this safely...<br />Good luck &amp; welcome to SR&nbsp; :)

Box address?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />How would you do that, at a mom and pop mailbox company? USPS PO boxes don&#039;t have normal street addresses and you can&#039;t &quot;set that up&quot; for them. A small, independently owned mailbox company (not a chain like Mailboxes Etc or UPS) is a good option because a lot of times they don&#039;t ask for ID and your address is the address of the business. <br /><br />However, I think that simply getting a PO box can be suspicious. It depends on who you are. If you are 40 years old, you may need a PO box for a legitimate business. But how many 20 year olds need PO boxes? Add the fact that this person only gets packages once every few weeks, and never gets regular mail, and it should look suspicious to anyone who bothers to notice. I&#039;m pretty sure that USPS and LE are aware that PO boxes are a popular choice for young people to receive drugs. You might expect this mail to be under higher scrutiny, while mail sent to a private residence is mixed with all the other regular mail.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if any of that is true, but it&#039;s something to think about. One thing is certain, PO boxes don&#039;t provide additional security, except in cases where you can determine that the package has been compromised before you pick it up, which is rare. Otherwise, renting a PO box can actually make things worse, because you have to take a positive action to pick up the package, whereas you are more of a passive recipient (with higher plausible deniability) of mail that gets stuffed in your home mail box.

				Ya please dont use a fake address. I hate it when people try to be sneaky and use an address that isnt their own. <br />Then when the mailman figures out its an empty house, the package will get shipped back to the return address and then I cant use that return address anymore.<br /><br />I hate that shit!<br /><br />Just use your address if it is for personal use. If you use a trusted vendor, then everything will be fine. If you are looking for an oz&#039;s of cocaine though, then ya I would probably figure out how to open a PO box that isnt in your name. <br /><br />But please dont just use some random house or empty house. That shit is just stupid.

				Yea bro like everyone said learn the basics first.. I didnt make a order for almost 2 months off here, Just Lurked and read to make sure everything was as it seems, cause at first it really seems way to good to be true.. I myself have never used a fake name or someone elses address and never have any type of issues . It also helps though that iv always had diffrent stuff sent to my house for years from ebay and all kinda diff places so its nothing really suspect except the damn once a while 4 or 5 packs comes in at one time and my mailbox is overflowing lol..Other than that is cool bro, like someone else said as long as your not trying to buy a OZ of crack ,coke heroin or any HUGE amount your fine, the vendors take pre cations in mailing your goods, this is not some BS up for a mnth Indian or paki scam site.. Have fun,Enjoy,relax, AND GET HIGH!!!

				For both you and your vendor&#039;s sake, please use a real address that will not provide problems for the postal service.&nbsp; Fake addresses only complicate and fail orders.

				me personally I used the place I am at or my p.o. box depending on what I am getting.&nbsp; Keep in mind I am a vendor and this is my vendor username.&nbsp; &nbsp;The customers who use their real name on their the packages have the highest success rates is for those use their real name and address that is not to say drop houses work.&nbsp; I know it is super hard to rationalize this idea but I cant fucking reiterate enough NO ONE I mean NO One wants to be safe and not go to jail more than your VENDORS.&nbsp; You are gonna probably buy a couple grams from a person who probably has a few keys laying around.&nbsp; When I send packages they are definitely bagged, re-bagged and heat sealed... even though a lot of my products are relatively odorless and still legal in most states.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know it seems irrational but vendors will lose money buy scamming you on your first order.&nbsp; The margin of profit on each sale should be so great that they would profit more buy a second sale than if they had just kept money and didn&#039;t send the first order.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I know I believe in my product enough that people will be back.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also P.O. Boxes can hold a package until you sign for it, if the package doesn&#039;t fit in your box, just keep that in mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;
