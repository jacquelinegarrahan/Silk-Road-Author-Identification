				I realize this is not the correct place to place this technical inquiry but that dude GTYTGFYFTY is spam clogging everything in the Technical subheading and burying anything new other than his nonsense about buying BTC. Seriously dude - do you thing pestering people to fucking death will make them look favorably upon you enough to purchase any of your wares. Can&#039;t admin limit the number of identical posts this cunt can put up?<br /><br />This is a quick ? for one of the Sr. Vendors who happen to be sleep deprived and trolling for something to do. I have a question regarding cancellations of orders. I am a new vendor and have yet to deal with this situation.<br /><br />Long story short, a customer purchased one of my premium ads. The whole clusterfuck happened with SR and accessibility, as you all know, became a huge ordeal. Because I was unable to reach this gentleman, I ended up selling the product allocated to him locally, with the expectation that I would get more by the time the SR connection issues were resolved.<br /><br />Well today we were finally able to get back in touch with each other.He ended up purchasing a similar product locally as well therefore he no longer needed my product.&nbsp; My question is simple - can I cancel the still outstanding order without penalty? My setting are hedged to the dollar. If I am going to get penalized, how much will that be? The BTC seems to have appreciated by about .50 cents per BTC.<br /><br />I need to get this resolved tonight before I go to bed some help would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />JUICE&nbsp; ;)

				Juicy<br /><br />You&#039;re probably asleep by now. If you haven&#039;t yet marked the order in transit, you can safely cancel it at no loss to yourself. If you use the hedging service, the buyer will get back 2-4% less due to hedging fees. If you have already marked the order in transit, but have not yet shipped (you shouldn&#039;t be doing this), you can cancel the order and specify never sent and again the buyer will dinged a 2-4% hedging fee. <br /><br />Also, if you have not yet marked the order in transit and cancel it, the buyer will not be able to leave feedback. If you have marked it in transit and then cancel it, the buyer will be able to leave feedback. Be careful, I have had buyers in the past leave a 1/5 for feedback on cancelled orders.<br /><br />MJMuse
