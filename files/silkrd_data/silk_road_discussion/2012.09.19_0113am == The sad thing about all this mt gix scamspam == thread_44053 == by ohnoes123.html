				is that at least a handful of some desperate poor dumbfuck is sending this spammer money because he keeps coming back like herpes.<br /><br />the fact that someone would sell btc at half the price they could AUTOMATICALLY sell it for on the major sites is not the baffling thing.<br /><br />the baffling thing is that people can&#039;t put 1 and 2 together to save their lives. this is a logic fail worse than basic addition for gods sake.<br /><br />if you&#039;re the scammer reading this, FU and may you die soon very much. <br />if you&#039;re the person getting scammed by this obvious spam, I&#039;m sorry but you&#039;re a god damned idiot, friend..

				I&#039;m not surprised.<br /><br />Remember when you arrived here? How new, and inexperienced, many of us are? Still, falling for a scam like this is pretty much your own fault. If it&#039;s too good to be true, it is.

				It truly is sad. The stupid fuck probably thinks he&#039;s getting away with something unique and worthy of self-admiration, while in reality, thousands of us could pull the same pathetic scam if we really wanted to.<br /><br />Being a scheming beggar on a drug forum does not make you smarter or better than anyone. To the rest of us, you are nothing but a little bitch gremlin that goes around bumping into ankles in hopes of knocking something shiny loose. A job at burger king would generate more income; too bad you have to get hired first lol.<br /><br />As for the people falling for this shit, COME ON!!! How the fuck do you trust anything posted by a newly registered username composed of random characters, let alone the spammy thread titles?

				Take it easy folks! Not everyone can be as brilliant as you lot!!!&nbsp; :)<br />It is a scam and does look good and is aimed at people that are not 100% street wise so they might get 1 in 100 and maybe more elsewhere. The scammers are probably at it all day everyday to catch that 1.<br /><br /><br />
