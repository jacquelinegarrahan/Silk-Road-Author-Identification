				Hey everyone, have a USA-Australia flight coming up in a couple of weeks and was wondering what would be the best way to get intoxicated for this?I have opiate experience, but was initially thinking a norco or something would work? Happy to hear any and all opinions. Peace<br />

				I know this is a radically innovative suggestion, but try taking the pills about 30 minutes before you want to feel them. 8)<br /><br />They are easy enough to sneak through security onto the plane, so you don&#039;t really have to take them before you go through security.

				Get 1 percocet 5/325. Break in half. As soon as you&#039;re seated, ask for a bottle of tonic water use it to take 1st half. 6 hours later, take the other half with another bottle of tonic water. The quinine in the tonic water acts as a potentiator. If you want a nicer dope nod and a bump in <br />eurphoria, take 1/3rd to 1/2 Benadyrl with each 1/2 percocet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wow, to be opiate naive again...<br />

				Ah, sweet opiates. You&#039;re speaking my language, though I&#039;m still thankfully closer to being a noob than a hardcore user, as far as tolerance goes.<br /><br />Percs and hydrocodone both react differently for diff people. For me, I started with norcos...just one. If you&#039;re a noob, 1 norco will have you feeling awesome with a nice bliss that will have you starting convos with the guy next to you, and probably the people in other rows.<br /><br />I have found, however, that to feel nice again, you should wait several hours (at least in my case)to take another...else if you try to extend it, you&#039;ll just get kinda &quot;blah..which is nice for most but not nearly as much bliss. I tend to do them once a day, as the first dose of the day is always best.
