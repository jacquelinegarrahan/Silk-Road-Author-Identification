				SR has had a positive impact for vendors and buyers alike. As a vendor I feel it&#039;s time to pass on a bit of the good fortune to others.

Without it harm reduction would be much more difficult.<br /><br />Sean&#039;s Outpost( is a Bitcoin funded charity in Florida which serves meals to the homeless and has just opened a homeless sanctuary to help them get back on their feet.

				This a great step towards improving the negative image many people have of SR.&nbsp; Funding a charity in Florida which serves meals to the homeless and has just opened a homeless sanctuary?&nbsp; What&#039;s not to like? <br /><br />Drugs may be bad (as South Park&#039;s Mr. Mackey would say) but giving to the homeless isn&#039;t. <br />&nbsp;

				IRL i have done this a few times but with cash donations or using said cash to purchase canned goods and then donating to a homeless shelter or soup kitchen. I was once homeless and very poor, my life depended on the help that came from these places and now that I am in a totally different position I try to give back what I can and when I can to places that have helped me. <br /><br />+1 and kudos, erowid is harm reduction 101

				Great idea, I like that this is coming from FiberOptic, who i probably wouldn&#039;t have ended up ordering from if not for the wealth of information available on RCs at Erowid that gave me a pretty good idea of what to expect. I actually just recently donated a small amount of BTC to them last week. Expect another order from me soon Fiber :-)

				This would be an excellent PR move, especially if you got at least a couple dozen high profile blogs to cover it.<br /><br />The more the Tor underbelly can promote the Robin Hood side of the deep web in public perception, the more cover it is going to have.<br /><br />And you can help some people in need during the process.

				Kudos to OP for starting this thread about giving back to the needy community...Before starting to vend on SR i was homeless and involved with street people...a lot of my close friends contracted chronic diseases.<br /><br />We live in a mean world corrupted by evil politicians and greedy businessmen. and we the dealers get singled out for all evils in this society <br /><br />A lot of vendors here have made fortunes thanks to SR revolution. i think its high time to donate part of proceedings to charities and lobbies influencing govt decision making<br /><br />I was involved with an IOP for a while(also vending on SR for 2 years) and talked to lot of clients whose life have been brightened by cheap generics supplied by me. A lot of these people are terminally ill suffering from cancer/ HIV which suck a lot of monies out of their budget. <br /><br />Big pharma hoard cash in swiss banks which lasts for generations. Big pharma is involved in price fixing and rigging according to a countries income levels. Its high time we expose these white collared criminals..They are wolves in sheeps clothing.<br /><br />I am firm believer in cheap affordable meds for the aid of mankind. I give part of our profits for bringing positive changes to lives of marginalized people who cannot afford meds. <br /><br />I am open to sincere offers to supply cheap cost priced bulk meds for Hiv/ Aids/ Cancer patients worldwide. I plan to get involved with projects supplying cheap affordable meds to people in Africa, asia, worldwide. This is kind of thing which govts. and UN have failed in.<br /><br /><br />This is my way to say Thank You and bring positive change.<br /><br /><br />MEGA PHARMA<br />

				It&#039;d be cool if you were actually doing this for the benefit of charity, just a publicity stunt for your business. I&#039;ve given away $100&#039;s at a time without anyone knowing and I don&#039;t even have a steady flow of income, you just felt the need to make a big deal out of this for your ego, or your business? In the meantime tell DPR when you get a chance to donate some of the extra BTC he&#039;s decided to get to charity if he hasn&#039;t already, because anyone who is smart knows that he didn&#039;t change the price because of the market change but because he gets more Bitcoins. I have $2000 in BTC and I didn&#039;t have a problem getting rid of them at Mt. Gox price, I actually had multiple offers. SR can suck my dick, I guess everyone ends up getting greedy in the end. Why have enough to last your lifetime when you can have 100x that?

				I really like the idea, when we started out TSC we did a few charity give aways, since then we&#039;ve been to busy trying to grow the company and havn&#039;t been keeping an eye any charities. Instead of giving to a local charity this time, I would like to know if any SR buyers have a charity close to heart that they perhaps would like to give to but due to financial constraints cannot. TSC will donate between 5% and 20% of one weeks gross earnings, should be roughly around 10k <br />ACE

If you are not aware, it is currently very hard to cash out via mtgox so the prices listed on mtgox are severely inflated. If you are able to sell at mtgox prices so easily then there is an excellent arbitrage opportunity for you. You can simply buy from campbx or coinbase and then sell at mtgox prices for a very respectable profit. DPR does not benefit from this change in exchange rate, it helps ease the affect on vendors but last I checked he is still averaging mtgox with other exchanges so as a vendor I am still getting less than my asking price because I cant sell at the exchange rate being used.<br /><br />As far as ego or sales boosting. I don&#039;t expect I&#039;ll see a significant rise in sales from this and even if I do it will still be negated by the donation percentage. I like to believe in positive momentum. By announcing here that I will be donating a percent of sales to charity it brings the potential to get other vendors to take part who may not have done so otherwise and all around raise awareness.<br /><br />Good luck mate.

				would it be an idea to somehow send the btc to an international media agency requesting them to pass it on to the listed charities? that way we&#039;d get media coverage for doing it. my only concern is that they would pass the money on to the fed as drug profits. but maybe someone could come up with a way to word it so that it doesn&#039;t imply that it is drug revenue.

				It warms my heart to see everyone&#039;s generosity.&nbsp; There are a couple of points I&#039;d like to mention about giving to charity.&nbsp; For one, I think it is an important pillar of civil society.&nbsp; Our capacity for empathy and wanting others to succeed should not be ignored or downplayed.&nbsp; A lack of charitable spirit is often used as a point in favor of a central authority with the power to take from the rich and give to the poor.&nbsp; It is said that, absent government intervention, no one would have the incentive to help those who are in need and have little to give in return.&nbsp; You are proving them wrong right now.<br /><br />Second, you must be responsible for the effect of money on your fellow man.&nbsp; Money encourages and motivates people to do whatever they have to in order to get that money.&nbsp; For an employee, that&#039;s doing a good job and pleasing their boss, or maybe blending in and not risking a visible mistake, or maybe lying on their resume.&nbsp; For a businessman, that can mean serving their customers, or bribe the authorities to enact laws that hurt their competition, among many other things.&nbsp; A dictator/politician will murder thousands, even millions, to keep their, or their party&#039;s control of tax revenue.&nbsp; Con artists and thieves have their way of getting money.&nbsp; For beggars, often being helpless and/or destitute gets a good return.&nbsp; In other words, money shapes people&#039;s behavior, which in turn shapes who they are, and it is not the case that giving someone money always has the effect you hope it does.<br /><br />So, don&#039;t ignore your desire to help people, but strive always to give in such a way that people are empowered to rise up out of their conditions and transform their lives.&nbsp; Just be careful you aren&#039;t creating an incentive for people to become needy and destitute in order to win your charity.

				Hi, I like this idea and would like to offer up a couple of things -<br /><br />I&#039;ve about 50 Gandalf blotters (70 - 110ug, unevenly laid) and about 70 chipped Ninja Turtle pills (110mg MDMA), I&#039;ll put up specific listings for these now and donate 100% of the proceeds from both.<br /><br />JC

				i dont think we should be so negative towards the idea of public image. it is a concrete fact, this community is going to become more and more in the spotlight. the media will always paint things in a sensationalist light but i think the public opinion towards drugs has changed. hell, a very very large percentage of people under the age of 40 have experience with drugs now (30 years ago, that statistic was very different, and it is that generation that is currently in power). just yesterday the guardian ran an article with a very high ranking member of british LE calling for an end to the drugs war. a bunch of drug dealers giving away hundreds of thousands of euros anonymously to charities will definitely make people think. no matter what way the media portrays it.<br /><br />with regard to that sale listing, that is by no means the only donation we&#039;ll make. the majority have not and will not be broadcast to the outside world, it&#039;s enough to know it helps someone. we don&#039;t care who else knows :)<br /><br />the old ladies and the politicians will still think the same way. who cares, they&#039;ll be dead soon enough.

				<br />Charities have an obligation to refuse donations they reasonably suspect come from proceeds of crime or are in other ways unethical (e.g. cancer charities accepting donations from tobacco companies for research). So if a big song and dance is made about X amount coming from the vendors of Silk Road, I guess that would count as being &#039;reasonably suspect&#039; if that exact amount suddenly appeared in their bitcoin account.<br />&nbsp;<br />What I don&#039;t know is how they can refuse an anonymous bitcoin donation. Do they have to hand it over to the authorities? Is there any way of proving it came from Silk Road? I guess that whatever rule they have for accepting or refusing a big bag of anonymous cash also applies to an anonymous bitcoin donation.<br /><br /><br />x Eiley
