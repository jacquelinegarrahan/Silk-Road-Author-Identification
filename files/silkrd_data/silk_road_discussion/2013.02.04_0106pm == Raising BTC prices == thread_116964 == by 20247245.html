That&#039;s hard to determine because there are so many ways of buying bitcoins, and you don&#039;t know from analyzing the block chain which are purchases (or conversions from fiat currency to BTC) and which are just bitcions moving around between addresses. It&#039;s trivial to determine the transaction volume (ie, BTC moving between addresses) but lots of that activity is people moving BTC around to mix it, obscure it, etc., and that doesn&#039;t represent purchases of BTC.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=116964.msg791249#msg791249">Quote from: 20247245 on February 04, 2013, 02:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Methinks for one its speculators that are buying them in hopes of making a profit<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I think it&#039;s mostly speculators, various anarchist types who support non-state sponsored currency, and people buying illegal things.

				I agree with the above comments and will add:<br /><br />When the price is rising, People tend to try and wait longer to sell (if they plan to sell). Also more people think buying them seems like a good idea. This all pushes the price higher and self fulfills.<br /><br />As soon as the price falls a bit, some will sell that have been waiting for the right time. If enough sell, the price will move down enough to spook the masses into fear selling. Then we will get another crash unless speculators are buying all the btc near current prices. I&#039;d guess fear selling will lead to low price opportunities for speculators and that will push the price down hard soon. <br /><br />These fluctuations in this unstable currency don&#039;t bother me much as the long-term trend for BTC is upward and I think signs are good for that to remain true for the forseeable future. If I had cash, I&#039;d look at the next crash as a likely opportunity. That said, I would not gamble like this unless I could afford to lose my stake. I do see this as gambling due to the lack of stability.<br /><br />As a vendor, the instability is quite a concern, especially due to the potential of escrow taking a long time. Hedging my sales costs like 4% or somesuch and I hate to pay fees like that even if they are fair. I guess if I think a crash is imminent, I should hedge my sales? I have not really figured it out yet. I have not hedged any sales yet. I think that means I am still optimistic :-)

So a million old X = 1 new X. They could do that with bitcoins too, except in the opposite direction. Currently, bitcoins are divisible to .00000001 (10^-8), which is called a Satoshi, but that&#039;s not a hard limit. 1 Satoshi could be redefined as 1 bitcoin and re-partitioned to 10^-8. In that case, someone holding 10 BTC today would hold a billion of the new bitcoins.

				it has nowhere to go but up.. but still, if SR came out and started using the alternative litecoins in addition to BTC, you can definitely count on bitcoins to make a quick drop and rise.<br /><br />i think the currency will continue to become more and more commonly used, but i don&#039;t see how it&#039;ll become a legit world currency.

				BTC works as any currency based on a &quot;physical&quot; asset. The more people have faith in that currency (heavily influenced by the number of people using that currency / fluidity of transactions - it got a lot of press recently and is even getting used mainstream, such as for donations to wikileaks or others), the stronger it gets comparatively to other currencies. Plus, BTC are made as so they&#039;ll get harder and harder to mine over time, so a part of their increase in value is built into the system itself. <br /><br />Sellers just have to set their prices accordingly, and buyer to always think in their local currency. You can also try a little trading. It&#039;s always good fun, as long as you don&#039;t build your groovy BTC day trading techniques during your BTC bought LSD trips.
