				Is it just me or has business stopped due to the rising bitcoin? It is of cores understandable when you are able to buy 10% more for your bitcoins tomorrow. But I definitely do feel allot less interest in my products and for no other reason. How about you? ::) :(

				As a buyer (hence possessing the thought process of the common small time buyer), I&#039;ll say that might have an effect on the volume of sales for a few days. But, even if the rise continues at the same rate, volumes should return to normal rather quickly. Users will have to order when they&#039;re close to running out. <br /><br />If you&#039;re selling roids, those using them have to keep to a program and should not break cycles. So they might wait a little by using their emergency stash, but they won&#039;t risk running out. Orders will resume. Same for those selling physically or psychologically addictive drugs (should be less affected, as hitting the emergency stash for any reason should be terrifying to most of those users). <br /><br />A few users might leave completely to go back to getting stabbed on a street corner because they think they get less drugs for their dollar, as money takes some time to convert from any currency into BTC, and reading the forum taught me that a small percentage of humans don&#039;t have the ability to understand that SR prices are adjusted accordingly to the exchange rate. They should be replaced thanks to the growth SR has probably known from media exposure a while ago, even if there isn&#039;t probably much word of mouth going on about it besides that (&quot;oh, hi Bob. I dunno if you&#039;re as addicted to illicit drugs as I am, but if you are, you should check this SR website. It&#039;s a bomb&quot; is rarely heard during coffee breaks at the office).

				I think some fear is like mine;&nbsp; nobody wants to be stuck with coins they bought at a dangerously inflated price and it crash before they get to SR and spend them.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-).&nbsp; <br /><br />It would suck to see it crash right after you bought.&nbsp; Mbut, everybody needs drugs.&nbsp; Sooner or later.&nbsp; &nbsp;They will take the risk and buy. <br /><br />You got to admit, it&#039;s crash season when the price doubles every few weeks for no apparent reason.&nbsp; It&#039;s fucking scary to buy coins when you know nobody in the history of the world has ever paid that much for a concept currency.&nbsp; It&#039;s inflated for sure.&nbsp; A one time bubble growing and only 5 months ago it was like $10. Last year at this time,&nbsp; it crashed to about a few cents dand then stable at $2.00 for a long while after that.&nbsp; So this time, it will do the same and balance out at a higher price like $5.00.&nbsp; Then you buy coins again.&nbsp; &nbsp;I sometimes wonder if its a pyramid sceme that grows each time a news article is done and lures new investors into bit coin or inadvertently SR for drugs.&nbsp; You gotta admit, SR is in some control of bit coin prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;A newarket just opened up that uses a new bit coin called lite coins .&nbsp; They will control that currency like SR does with this one.&nbsp; Dunno.&nbsp; But we are blessed to be on the ground floor of this chance to double your money tax free every year.&nbsp; <br /><br />
