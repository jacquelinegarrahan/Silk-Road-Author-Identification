				Don&#039;t have anything against in principle however as a new vendor I was offering some samples (within the U.K) however I made the mistake of leaving the worldwide option in the delivery section and a user ordered which I then cancelled and explained the situation. He left me a 1/5 rating but I messaged him and he changed the feedback to a 5/5. However my the rating next to my username stands at 1.6 although I have 4 5/5 ratings.<br /><br />Can&#039;t seem to see a vendor support section - if anyone sends me the link it will be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Felix

				You can&#039;t enter the vendor section until approved. See the wiki for how to obtain approval. <br /><br />As for your rating, the impact of negative ratings are instant. But the impact of positive ratings takes quite a while to reflect. Could be a few days. Nothing SR staff can do to speed it up. Weird isn&#039;t it? <br /><br />If you cancel orders, make sure you do so within 4 days. Then the buyer can&#039;t leave feedback. Once marked in transit or left to go late, the buyer can leave feedback. But now with the discussion page on your profile, pissy buyers who get their orders cancelled but can&#039;t leave regular feedback can leave a pissy comment on your discussion page. <br /><br />Also be careful. As a new vendor, you stand the risk of double whammy blackmail - feedback blackmail and discussion page blackmail. Both can occur at the same time. <br /><br />It would be nice if you had to option to disable the discussion page wouldn&#039;t it? And if you report a post on your discussion page, it might end up with the person who left it being banned from posting on it. But it could take hours to days before SR staff gets around to removing the comment. Moderation powers for your own vendor page should be given to you and not to SR staff.
