				Dont know about anyone else but I use the forums to help me make decisions on SR and to communicate with certain members.<br />Not to read stupid fucking bitching about how fucked Silk Road is, or conspiracy theories, or about how this is &quot;the end&quot;.<br />Every single time the road is down for any reason, be it maintenance for a few hours or a week long upgrade, people come on and post the same shit time and time again.<br />Post it in the rumor mill or something because that is exactly what it is.<br />This place makes ALOT of money each and every day, it is hugely in the staffs interests to keep the site up and avoid down time so everyone can rest assured that a team of people are working on the site as quickly as possible and solving problems as they arise 24/7. The other thing people seem to forget is that this is a massive multi-million dollar website with more traffic than much of the well known clear-net sites. The whole system has to run over TOR, the servers must remain totally anonymous and the site is probably under a bigger threat of attack than any other system in the world. I think we can expect some issues here and there.<br />I for one think the staff are doing an excellent job and am very grateful for Silk Road, long may it continue which im certain it will.<br />If I turn out to be wrong, send me a PM with your address once the site is down for good and I will send you 500GBP of BTC - no joke&nbsp; ;)<br />

				Good rant.&nbsp; So true.<br /><br />I guess there are a lot of people high and posting.&nbsp; I do it all the time&nbsp; :-(. Then delete regreted posts the next day.&nbsp; I think there are also a lot of younger people as well who are a little more social and come from a Facebook and MSN generation with lots of chatin&#039; .<br /><br />The staff here are amazing.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine how thy keep up.&nbsp; I owe a lot to the road and its why I offer to help on the forums the best I can. <br /><br />I pray to a new god now.&nbsp; This is its altar.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

People like to talk without having all the facts or talk thinking they have all the facts when they don&#039;t. This sort of topics do belong in the rumor mill section. I am into conspiracy theories that can be backed up with facts but are been kept hidden from the masses, the theories I read in these forums about DPR or Silk Road sound paranoid and can&#039;t really be backed up with facts and it never stops no matter how many times he fixes everything back up, the rumors always return.

				Oh and for clarity I think nomad was insinuating I was asking for a geographic address which is obviously not the case..<br />I was referring to a Bitcoin Address- don&#039;t see how you could blackmail someone if all you have is their BTC receiving address...&nbsp; ;)

				Thanks nomad-<br />Just didnt want people here to think I cannot be held to my word.<br />Honesty is the golden rule in all business that I do legal or otherwise which is why I think I have been fortunate enough to make the contacts I have made and the money I have made in a short amount of time- I want to make sure the SR community know that I am honest and reliable, I have only ever had to have one refund and that was because a vendor I had never dealt with before only sent 20% of my order. All other deals I have made have went perfectly and I have spent just over 1000BTC in the last 2 months, so I hope you understand why my reputation is so important to me.<br />-Life
