				Im going to post this in two forms to get the best response but...<br /><br /><br />As I look around on SR most of the products im looking for seem to be a tad out of my price range VS (what i can get pay locally and for the most part same quality ) internationally.<br /><br />However, If i could supply domestic prices that are very competitive price to international prices (talking USA only ATM)&nbsp; how would that react to international venders. Im not trying to piss anyone off but....<br /><br />If I can supply product&nbsp; for about 3-6 dollars more per unit in a domestic area whats the consequences?<br /><br />I dont want to make International venders mad and have a back lash of angry people, nor do I want to cause interest in domestic Police enforcement to try and find my ass etc.<br /><br />Just to give an idea on what I could provide is as follows:<br /><br />DMT<br />Ketamine<br />Weed (high quality)<br />GHB<br />Mushrooms (and sortable psylicibin) <br />MDMA and pressed pills<br />Xannax and Valium <br />Adderal, Ritalin, and other similar stimulants.<br /><br />I would like to get a feel from the community before I take the plunge and make a seller account...any feed back would be great.<br /><br /><br />Thanks you<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This is a free market.. who cares if you make people angry? it will just make them lower their prices as well. this isnt like dealing on the street. its not like your competition is going to going to come to your house and break your legs if they are mad here. competition is good for the market

				Undercut as much as you want, the community will welcome you with open arms.&nbsp; As mentioned above it will lower prices from any vendor competition as well if you&#039;re successful which is also good for the buyers on the site.&nbsp; Free market etc etc

				Supply lowers demand hence lowering price. We all learned that in middle school. <br /><br />Bring what you got, but be warned when you find most vendors prices about the same on things it is usually for a reason.<br /><br />Setting up and maintaining a good and SAFE vendor account requires time, patience, supplies and $.<br /><br /><br />If you just wanna throw your goods in a sandwich bag and lick a stamp on an envelope and have the cheapest prices, then you won&#039;t last.<br /><br />A lot come and go, then the ones that stay. Even&nbsp; more just talk and never even come.<br /><br />I strongly feel no one will be upset at you if you step forward with a professional service and can still offer lower pricing then anyone else.<br /><br />bring it. You are welcome here.<br />

When you move the supply curve, because supply increases, they cross at a lower point. They are only relative to each other. Price doesn&#039;t care which one moved, only where they intersect.<br /><br />&#039;Increased supply relatively lowers demand, hence lowering price.&#039;<br /><br />It sounds like shroomeister learned this in middle school and you learned it in college.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

And when you mentioned vendor &quot;connections&quot; I hope you were referring to the vendor&#039;s supply guy. If you can afford to put out good gear at a decent price then go for it! Look at Dutchaanbod&#039;s WalMart&quot; approach (as I like to call it)...His molly is the cheapest on SR at $18/g...but he&#039;s selling a shit ton of it. He probably sends over a hundred packages/day. I thought about becoming a vendor too...but I know myself and I&#039;m not for everything it entails. Just do the research and Best of Luck!

				If you can undercut these mushroom vendors I would love you forever. My preferred guy isn&#039;t selling cubes anymore and everyone else is slinging them for 2-4x the price I&#039;m used to paying, which just isn&#039;t kosher. Stones are cool and all but they just don&#039;t measure up to cubes, and I really don&#039;t care for their unpredictability<br /><br />DMT &amp; Ketamine would be nice too, big drought lately

WTF. I always thought the prices around here were a bit low for shrooms (when I got here) Now I see that it must just be Rocker that is holding the prices down.<br /><br />there was a shortage about a week or 2 ago, and now I think everyone is trying to cash in before Halloween.<br /><br />I am not sure when I will have anymore, but best believe that my prices will be the same as always (I have just gotten use to them) so either I will sell out quick..... or they will lower.<br /><br />It appears like some folks are just taking advantage of an opportunity, Can&#039;t hate them for it, but man....
