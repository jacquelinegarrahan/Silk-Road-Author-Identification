				This is getting ridiculous. Hard to have happy customers, if you can&#039;t get to your orders, when SR is so unreliable. Hard to turn a profit when bitcoin fluctuates and you can&#039;t access your funds. Is the server under attack? What is the official word on the reason behind the unreliable connection to SR?<br />Been trying 4 hours so far this morning to get to my order&#039;s with no luck... <br />Anyone else having problems?

				I don&#039;t always connect to Silk Road on my first try. Among the things I do is refresh the page, open and close the tor browser bundle, go to the Vidalia control Panel and &#039;Use a new connection&#039;, and even hop on my laptop and use my neighbour&#039;s wifi. <br /><br />I eventually connect but it is definitely a pain sometimes.

				I&#039;m recovering from 36 straight hour of having NO access to my account. I was scared shitless, but we got it figured out.<br /><br />But when I got on, I had a huge amount of back-orders, which I&#039;m just now starting to work out. And which caused me to spend about 2 hours sending out messages and upgrading shipping. Really not what I wanted to spend my Friday stressing about. I like to spend Fridays stressing about girls and where to drink.<br /><br />Feel free to message me on SR to keep me company. I&#039;ll be here all day.

				My experience is similar to the others. I&#039;m using the Tor Browser Bundle on Win XP. If I can&#039;t get to the Silk Road log in page I click the onion icon on my browser and choose &quot;New Identity&quot; (new Tor exit node). <br /><br />That usually does the trick until, at some random time interval, I will see the &quot;problem load page&quot; message and I&#039;ll have to click the onion icon again. Today I was accessing Silk Road pages for 3 or 4 hours before I got &quot;problem loading page&quot;message. That&#039;s a record for me.

				Working for me. Though I should note, it has been difficult to get on lately. I know SR is aware of this and is trying to improve the situation. In think we all just got to sit tight, and keep trying. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				What am I doing wrong? I tried everything, changing to different VPN&#039;s while connected to Tor network. Tethering through my droid phone. Using neighbors connection... nothing... not even a hiccup. =/
