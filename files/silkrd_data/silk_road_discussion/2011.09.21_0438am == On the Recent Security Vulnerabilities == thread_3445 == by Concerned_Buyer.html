				First, I&#039;d like to thank Silk Road for all the hard work he&#039;s put into the site. Thanks to him I&#039;m smoking better bud than I have in a long time.<br /><br />Next, a small amount of background information on me. In the real world I&#039;m a web architect/developer. I&#039;m also a buyer here, but I&#039;m posting under another name because I&#039;m not sure how this topic will be received and I don&#039;t want to do anything to risk my pristine buyer account.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen much discussion on the recent security vulnerabilities, so I wanted to give my thoughts on them for those who may not know as much about the topic.<br /><br />I first noticed &quot;issues&quot; with the website when I was playing around with the HTML/CSS (trying to make it a bit prettier). An alarm went off in my head when I realized that the layout for the Silk Road is table based. This is in no way a security issue, but it does show that whoever wrote the site is very behind the times in terms of web design. I didn&#039;t think much about it though because it&#039;s only aesthetics, and being good with HTML/CSS isn&#039;t really necessary to be a good backend dev (which is where most of the security concerns are here).<br /><br />However, as I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen, there have been some vulnerabilities in the backend disclosed recently. This is very concerning to me because these bugs have not been advanced bugs, in fact they are very simple. Protecting against these things is net security 101. They are extremely common attacks, and I would expect even a green web developer straight out of school to have no problems protecting against them. If any of my employees let such a bug into production (especially on a site as security sensitive as this) I would fire them immediately. I continually hear people talk about how secure this site must be, and how extra money would help with &quot;advanced&quot; security, but it&#039;s clear that the site hasn&#039;t even made it to the point of basic security. If these vulnerabilities existed you can be certain that there are others waiting to be discovered (or that already have been).<br /><br />So what does this mean to me? I will continue using the site, but will not trust it in any way. I will keep all bitcoins until right before a purchase, and I will tumble them myself. As long as my messages to sellers are encrypted with their pub-key I should still be safe. To be honest though, if another site gets a decent amount of vendors I will probably move along unless I see a serious improvement in the security here.<br /><br />I feel kind of bad writing this, it seems like I&#039;m ripping apart the work of someone who has done a lot for me. I really feel like less technical users should know the severity of the issues though.

				I completely agree with you and think that SR should really fix up this basic security stuff before taking fees of 12.5%. While others like the admin of OVDB talk about 64 bit-OpenBSD with ASLR and VM isolation, SR still hast SQL injection and XSS issues. To disclose and use these vulnerabilities is normal hacker 101, it&#039;s what everybody tries first when trying to hack a site. wtf.<br />SR is a cool guy, but the commission rate and overall security issues are a really bad sign of how this may go on.<br />Much love

				I&#039;m also unhappy with SR at the moment. It&#039;s clear that SR isn&#039;t a coder by profession, but simply someone with a decent computer knowledge base (enough to get this site up and running at least) who had a vision of this site and created it. I was OK with this at the inception of the site, I thought over a few months a lot of improvements would be made but so far very few new features have been implimented. He should really pay a real programmer to code the site and use that -- of course checking it for backdoors before putting it out into production.

				BM doesnt have a history(if you havent noticed,there is nothing on it)....oh come on,cut the crap man,youre the owner,trying to suck out all the sellers and buyers from silk road in these tough times....how can you even order on a site like that???are you mad?or are you the owner?...nobody in there right mind would order off there....<br /><br />your following qoute,just gave you the fuck away;<br /><br />&quot;&quot;I actually just placed my first order on BlackMarket reloaded from a vendor that has listing both here and there. Looking at the HTML it looks like it was built by a real web developer. I also did a cursory look for SQL injection vulnerabilities and found no problems. This wasn&#039;t in depth, so don&#039;t take it as though it&#039;s perfectly secure, but I definitely trust the developer there more than here. The 4% commission rate is also nice.<br /><br />If everything goes well I will continue looking at both sites, but I will lean towards using BlackMarket (hint hint vendors ;) )&quot;&quot;&quot;

Even when the &quot;reloaded&quot; site came online, I even went over there and set up a seller account under a highly rated vendor here just to see how extensive their &quot;SR verification&quot; was, and they activated that seller account right away. I am NOT that vendor, nor have I ever used that account on BM, I just wanted to make sure they were actually doing the verification that they claimed. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that they did not do it in that case. That is the only LEGITIMATE beef I have with him. he is trying to get some of the SR business, but as far as I can tell it is nothing but scam city over there, and if they will verify a known SR account to anyone who asks, better steer clear!

				lookbehindyou, tell us a little more about the SQL injection hole you found. It sounds like the type of vulnerability where if someone with minimal SQL experience typed in something like &quot;Durban&#039;s Poison&quot; they would see an SQL error and realize that they could then run queries on the rest of the database.<br /><br />CodeIgniter is pretty good, and it&#039;s taking care of a lot of the security problems SR forgot to worry about, but it can&#039;t take care of all of them.<br /><br />SR:<br /><br />This SQL injection on the search feature lookbehindyou talked about sounds really serious. That&#039;s the type of vulnerability that even the least-dedicated semi-experienced hacker will notice immediately. And if it&#039;s as bad as it sounds, that hacker had access to a *ton* of information. Are you looking through the past couple months logs for SQL errors and long queries? You should be. Because I bet lookbehindyou wasn&#039;t the first person to find this hole.<br /><br />How are you encrypting our passwords? MD5? MD5+Salt? <br /><br />What happens to our personal information after it&#039;s not needed anymore? Is that stuff just piling up in your database? Is there anyway that we can have our names and addresses not stored in plaintext on the server? The fact that he saw unencrypted names of customers from this hole is really scary to me.<br /><br />Let&#039;s open up a dialogue so that we can figure out how to make this work for everyone.

				yeah, but still, rake - SR doesn&#039;t take commission for nothing. I am sure he can make a decent living off of this site if he is clever, but yet he has to fix up some stuff. definitely.<br />And lookbehindyou is pretty much right: the security level is way below what it seemed to be.<br />On the other hand, you can do illegal shit pretty good without proper security as long it&#039;s not mega illegal. The thing is, the FBI can&#039;t be compared to the NSA, lookbehindyou. I say, if the NSA wants to fuck us up, this will be done in no time.<br />If the feds want to bring us down, they will try to spread FUD and bust single sellers by trying to make them do something stupid.<br />For example, I get roughly one enquiry per week asking if I can do accept bank wire or meet in person. This is how the feds would most likely try to bust someone, besides surveillance and correlation attacks on a rather basic level.<br />NSA would do correlation attacks based on things like your writing style, can do van-eck-phreaking, have shit like echelon. No way to get past this if you still have to fight sql-injection.<br />Much love<br />and don&#039;t lose faith.<br />if SR goes downhill, we will have other options.

				well, actually I guess FBI and such federal investigation organizations can do XSS and sql injection. To assume anything else would be stupid. However, they are pretty much incapable of busts via virtual means, apparently. Its maybe just not how they work. On another note, this whole stuff may be just too small for them, who knows. After all, there are and especially were tons of vendors who sold meth and H and such and took payment via cash in mail. This is pretty much insane, but it worked most of the time. If the feds would&#039;ve just used a tiny bit of surveillance, they could have easilty busted most of them.<br />Anyway, use great security. You don&#039;t want to be the first to recognize they&#039;ve learned something. Be more than one step ahead - this includes hardening yourself against such exploits, and in this sanitized arguments for SQL handling and keeping the latest version is pretty much basic.

				Just google &quot;Silk Road market&quot; or some such thing on the open internet.&nbsp; Yeah, LE knows about it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a matter of when they choose to invest their resources and get over bureaucratic inertia and the snarl of red tape they have to go through to start a new type of investigation into something they&#039;ve never done before.<br /><br />Look up what happened before the Commission Case and how long it took before they actually got it set up: the Feds have trouble moving quickly on most issues.&nbsp; That isn&#039;t going to stop certain types of attacks though, and we have no idea whether or not they already have a few hooks in, especially with the recently revealed security issues.

				I&nbsp; totally agree with Anarcho on the need to address this immediately as a community. I do have some questions:<br /><br />The main question is have all the discovered vulns been confirmed fixed? I think this is very important and I wish SR would post in this thread. Even just an &quot;aware and on top of it&quot; note. <br /><br />Also, what can we do proactively? actually start pen-testing the site and look for more issues to compile a list that will be presented to SR and/or the community? I would contribute BTCs if there&#039;s a collective effort to pay a reputable, symphatetic security pro to inspect and implement improvements.&nbsp; Or SR could let trusted members who are also coders to look at the application (not the actual database) and give it a proper audit.<br /><br />I&#039;m obviously also sensitive to the need for secrecy and understand that a closed system (&quot;release as little info as possible&quot;) has its advantages. However the OP did raise serious issues that concern us all. <br /><br />I guess I agree that there needs to be action on this, I&#039;m just not sure what that would be, especially without SR&#039;s cooperation. I think OP&#039;s idea of open-sourcing the code that runs the site and setting up a &quot;paranoid system&quot; like what lookbehindyou described may be the best way in the long run. Again, we could all contribute time/knowledge/money to such effort. But that&#039;s for another discussion. <br /><br />Back to the question: anything we users can do now?<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I am sorry, but I do have to kind of not agree with you on the thesis that this thread is largely whining. It&#039;s just putting emphasis on the fact that these vulnerabilities should simply not exist, and, in all honesty, I wouldn&#039;t really have thought of the fact they could. This is not cheap http whore fuck bragging or whatever, it&#039;s rather for people like you, who, as you said, have the job to deliver goods and not understand technicalities, so that you understand this is a very serious concern.<br />On another note, I am pretty certain SR knows about this thread or at the very least read similar concerns in the other thread made by lookbehindyou.<br />Moreover, you are right - we have to be kind of proactive. And I see that we are doing this right now: We create a thread were several concerned people signal to the community that there is some issue. I for myself am nowhere near tech savvy enough to be a hired admin or even being able to disclose severe issues. I would have managed to do the SQL injection, maybe, but I&#039;d had to discover it first. Thus, I can&#039;t really be proactive in the way you said - write PMs and address the issues to SR. Rather, I choose to sign the message that this thread provides: &quot;There is some serious issue, and at the very least you should communicate on it, especially in a time where you just wanted to double SRs commission. And please take a look if there are more such issues, because more of these will make me back out.&quot;<br />This is what we endorsed - not whining and not joining BM.<br />Much love,<br />M

				Improve improve improve! To my understanding, we are still in a period where LE has not decided to invest their resources in any action to take down SR. We must improve the site rapidly before they see it as an opportunity to infiltrate. Valuable information like names and addresses seem properly protected, but the user joining system and rating systems could be exploited to ruin SR.<br /><br />We have something very special on our hands. The power of modern technology has merged with the minds of intelligent individuals who are daring enough to work in the black market. Think about it, most people involved in the drug trade aren&#039;t very smart. How many of them could successfully sell in this market, or even simply access the site? Words like encryption, tor, and bitcoin are not part of their vocabulary, yet they are the primary target for LE. We must keep growing strong and we will never be defeated! If we stay on our toes, we could always be just a little too complex for LE to consider fucking with. If we stand still, they will catch up and pounce on the chance to destroy this new opportunity for drug trade.<br /><br />I&#039;m just throwing out my visions.
