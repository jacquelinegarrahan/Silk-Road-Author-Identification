				I say this only out of arrogance.<br /><br />The next phishing site will only have a the regular login page. It will look normal. The address will satisfy a quick-look even better when compared to the most recent one. I don&#039;t stop generating addresses. I have 5 .onion private-keys that corrispond to an address that starts with silkroad. I have 3 that say dkn255hz2. I will always be back with a better address every time.<br /><br />Let me tell you about more about my next phishing spot because my arrogance isn&#039;t satisfied yet. You will login. You will be presented with a Welcome Page that looks like the real one. My server will be copying it once an hour every hour at random intervals. My server will tell you that due to some reason or another you have to verify that you are the owner of your account. I am thinking it would be best to claim that the password-database and user-database were compromised and that the only way to prove you own the account and are not the hacker is to force the user to change their pin. My server will change the user&#039;s real pin on the real site to the same thing. My server will log usernames and test them immediately. If a details do not match to SR the user will not log in to my phishing site. Once the user has changed their pin because of my phishing site my site will stop accepting login information for that user and will instead just forward them to the main page for SR. This will catch many of you who use one of my phishing links. I will make system better. I do not rest. You are my profit.

				Sounds like you&#039;re wasting a lot of time for no real significant amount of money, huge waste of time. I&#039;m sure you could be spending your time doing something more productive then this, it&#039;s kinda pathetic I almost feel bad for you.
