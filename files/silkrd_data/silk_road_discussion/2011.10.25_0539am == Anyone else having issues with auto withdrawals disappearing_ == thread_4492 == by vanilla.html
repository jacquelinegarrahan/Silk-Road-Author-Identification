				I have twice now had the 3rd auto withdraw in a series of 3 disappear and not make it to my e-wallet. The first one was small and SR just credited it but the most recent one from last night was for over 74BTC. The other 2 that preceded it arrived just fine at their final destination but the third (the biggest one) has not. It shows up in my account page as having been auto-withdrawn but it did not make it to my e-wallet account. Also another thing that is weird is that all of my other successful auto withdrawals came from the first 2 addresses that I set. So far it does not appear that I have ever had any funds withdrawn to my 3rd BTC address. (Weird, huh?)<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Apparently there was some sort of glitch and during the time it took me to write the above post, SR had already answered my pm and credited the BTC.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D
