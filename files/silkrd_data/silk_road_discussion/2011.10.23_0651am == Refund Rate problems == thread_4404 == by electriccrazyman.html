				I am now showing a 13.61% refund rate on my purchasing stats. This is not an accurate reflection of my buying behavior. Of my transactions only a single one was settled due to non-delivery and that was an international order. A more accurate refund rate is the small amount that the vendor was out on that transaction against my total transactions - maybe 2% (the transaction history is gone so I can&#039;t calculate a precise number).<br /><br />Two transactions were recently canceled by the vendor after we exchanged PMs and mutually decided that was the right path to take.<br /><br />I believe that when a transaction is canceled by the vendor that it shouldn&#039;t show up as a refund in my purchasing stats - it&#039;s misleading in that nothing was lost other than the fact that my coins were locked up in escrow for some period of time and some time on both my and the vendor&#039;s part.<br /><br />I&#039;m posting this because I want to give any vendor I&#039;ve done business with the opportunity to dispute my approach to business here on SR. I would also like SR to adjust their buyer&#039;s Refund Rate calculation.<br />

				I noticed a small jump in my refund rate after I had to cancel an order that sat waiting for 6 days without any word from the vendor.<br /><br />So I agree they need to do something about cancellations.&nbsp; A cancellation is NOT a refund.&nbsp; Whether the buyer cancels because the vendor isn&#039;t responding (and they won&#039;t even let the buyer cancel for 5-6 days, which I think is too long, especially when the vendor isn&#039;t responding) or the seller marks it in-transit early and hasn&#039;t shipped 5 days later so the buyer asks him to cancel, it should not effect the refund stats.<br /><br />If they want to track it, then they should track it separately as cancellations not refunds.<br /><br />

				interesting. I recently had to cancel an order because seller simply disappeared before shipping my item. I waited for like 2-3 weeks before canceling, he never logged in during that time. My Refund rate: 0%.

				electrycrazyman, I think that I was that vendor what we settle at 90% refund (you wanted that I keep for postage cost). Item cost were around $25 if that help you.<br /><br />Anyhow, I think that cancel or refund depend on what option vendor select when issuing an refund<br />there is two of them<br />1) never shipped<br />2) never delivered<br /><br />I think if vendor choose 1) that that have not effect on refund statistic, but with 2) it does.

I thought we went 80/20, but either way that&#039;s right.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m guessing that never delivered is the default. If not, I can&#039;t understand why either of the last two vendors would choose it. Maybe it should be called &quot;shipped but didn&#039;t arrive&quot;.<br /><br />Thanks for letting me know what the vendor sees. I agree that 1 shouldn&#039;t count but 2 should. I&#039;m not sure that is the way it is now; Silk Road said they would change the algorithm, but not go back and calculate things retroactively.<br />

				Yooo if a vendor cancels an order, can the customer still leave feedback?
