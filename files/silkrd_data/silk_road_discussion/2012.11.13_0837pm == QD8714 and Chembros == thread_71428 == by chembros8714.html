				Chembros! happy to see you here! I placed my first order with you recently, and I was nervous just because there wasn&#039;t too much on the forums about you. it&#039;s nice to see you doing right by your customers :)<br /><br /><br />Would it be bothersome if people asked you if their particular order was sent out yet? I am curious to know if my order was shipped (it was marked as processing for a little while), but it&#039;s not totally necessary. I understand those requests might be a bit too much to answer individually.<br /><br /><br />Thanks, hope to report lovelyyyy things about your mdpv!

You&#039;re very trusted vendors and I only had one problem which was a order mixup but you took care of it quickly, oh, I hadn&#039;t tried a certain product before I left feedback a while ago, but I thought you should know, that Pentedrone is super weak! In my opinion, from the mixup you sent me a whole gram and I finished it within one night AND slept that night! Just letting you know if you didn&#039;t, I didn&#039;t mind of course because you sent me a ton extra, your other customers might not be happy by it though. x)

				have had no complaints except yours today ☔ I know if you have other chems in your system that trying to add another effects are unreliable.<br />I know this because of experience. Pent is not as strong as PV but it does the job when your out or want a less amped feeling.<br />I am no expert on Pent. this is just my experience turn into a opinion. <br />when SR resumes we will get you the new PV which is the best I&#039;ve seen in a long time.

I&#039;ve done QD&#039;s M1 and MDPV together, like when you&#039;re rolling on the Methylone already, take a 5-10mg bump, I thought I was going to die from pleasure overload, with methylone by itself I told myself &quot;I can&#039;t feel any better than this...&quot; but after a little bump of PV, woaah, I proved myself wrong! Intense rolling/stimulation, everyone should try that out. I plan on doing it more although it seems dangerous, you don&#039;t have a shitty all day comedown from the PV either when it&#039;s done, after it went away I just felt cloudy-headed and a bit depressed so I went to sleep early, after a night of PV I feel like a zombie (literally) the next morning. PV and M1 combo is the way to go!

				Dam I thought it would be up by now, reading the forums gets me scared. Vendors are a brave bunch but the facts are the feds would need a whole lot of evidence to bust down our doors. packages intercepted and traced to us them proof we sent it and the money trail would have to be established. I just don&#039;t see vendors getting busted in the masses. If you do just don&#039;t say a fucking word to the authorities it will do you nothing but harm.&nbsp; I am not in the US but doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m safe. I am not saying they can&#039;t find us its just unlikely the will to costly better to just chop the head off the snake like they did with Farmers Market. How do I get rid of all this product?

				So I picked up my package from QD8714 (shipped by/from Chembros). I&#039;m so relieved it&#039;s here!! I just tried some, I&#039;ll be sure to report back with a review once a day or two of responsible use has passed so I can be sure to experience all the effects, including come down.

				I got my stuff earlier, to those that are waiting for their stuff, know this stuff is different from the last batch they had. I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s less potent or more potent (as in, the amount needed for desired effects.) First bump was nice, I knew it was good stuff, the usual typing a million paragraphs to people about shit they don&#039;t even care about, after 30 minutes or so, I felt weird, like I didn&#039;t feel as happy and speedy, just depressing a little, cloudyheaded and wanting to just lay down, I could have done too much or not enough though, I&#039;m not sure. It took longer than usual for me to feel the effects, my heart was beating super fast but a few minutes later I felt it. It&#039;s pretty weird, I&#039;ve been continuing the fun since I recieved the product earlier, but some bumps give me the energy feeling, and others just make me feel confused, I don&#039;t know how to describe it, like a mini-comedown, maybe lack of dopamine? Not sure. Anyways, I did maybe 6 bumps in 5-6 hours and didn&#039;t get vasoconstriction like I did from the last batch, this batch does seem to make me WAY more paranoid, my leg muscles hurt a bit every now and then, my head hurt every few minutes, nothing major. The jittery feeling is stronger than last too, not being able to stay still without moving your hands/arms/legs, teeth grinding isn&#039;t that bad for me on PV, usual. Within the first hour though, I had the worst cottonmouth ever, I spit in the trash and it just stuck to the trashbag and didn&#039;t move, just really white foam, this eventually went away. My heart hurt a little, it usually doesn&#039;t but it didn&#039;t really bother me. I experienced something I haven&#039;t before though earlier, I was taking out the trash to the road because tomorrow is trash pick-up day, and as I was walking, I saw my shadow and it felt like my body and my mind were too different things. I obviously knew I was walking, but it felt like I wasn&#039;t controlling it, honestly I liked the last stuff better, for me this stuff just messes with my mind a lot more for some reason. <br /><br />Aparrt from the bigger problem with cottonmouth, higher paranoia, and that cloudyheaded feeling, everything else is the same, first bump was great though, QD is right, it&#039;s a good batch indeed. :) Fast shipping, discreet, quality product, weight seemed to be on point or close enough, I honestly have no knowledge of eyeballing a bag and have no scale. If I didn&#039;t know what 5mg looked like, I&#039;d probably be fucked. lol<br />QD, I will leave you feedback once traffic settles down, SR is loading really slow and most of the time I&#039;ve had to refresh, so I&#039;m gonna wait until people finish their &quot;grand opening 5-day-withdrawl shopping.&quot; :)<br /><br />OH YEAH, I have yet to experience the comedown, but the comedown is always the worst on MDPV, and QD shouldn&#039;t be blamed for that, just saying guys, you&#039;re gonna feel like a zombie if you stay up for a few nights, luckily I can feel psychosis coming and tell myself to stop. I don&#039;t have any benzos either, so tomorrow will be fun for sure going through that. :( <br /><br />Side note, I searched around for an answer to this but couldn&#039;t find any solid info, does anyone know if it&#039;s &quot;safe&quot; to take Propanolol during a comedown? All I found were people saying &quot;probably not&quot;, etc, might make a thread asking but I don&#039;t want to post stuff unless it&#039;s really important. <br /><br />Thanks for the amazing service, QD and chembros! :)

				Kinda long, but it&#039;s nearly impossible to explain anything with a simple answer on PV, if you don&#039;t feel like reading all of it, just know QD sticks to her word! I tried to give a detailed update after 12 hours, my apologies if this makes no sense, it seems to be typed okay in my eyes, but I have that light psychosis feeling where thinking gets a bit hard so forgive me if otherwise. From a positive view, when on PV, it helps give a pretty good detailed experience/review of itself from making me want to type and think so much. <br />Here&#039;s my review with this new batch, <br />About the vendor, QD and chembros are great, discreet super fast shipping, I think she sent this out on Thursday or Friday, and I recieved it yesterday, Tuesday morning, which is pretty fucking fast for there being no mail on Veterans Day (Monday), I&#039;m not sure if mail was moving Monday, people said different things, but if not, still super fast, and there being no mail service on Sunday.. Always order from this vendor with no problems except one mix up but she fixed it and quickly shipped my original order. Great prices for top grade stuff, if she says it&#039;s good, take her word for it, never wrong. <br />My &quot;review&quot;/feelings at 12 hour mark - <br />Updating because I&#039;m stupid and didn&#039;t sleep all night, so I&#039;ve been redosing for about 12 hours or so. Many of you stay smart and don&#039;t do this, but I know what I&#039;m getting into ahead of time and comedowns on PV are horrible, if you plan on staying up all night, or multiple days (don&#039;t do that. lol.) you should expect the worst and feeling like a zombie. :D At first I could tell the difference between this new stuff and the last batch, but then I did more and felt the same, extremely jittery, can&#039;t keep my arms or leg still, nothing changed from that. Teeth grinding is getting annoying because it&#039;s starting to hurt and I keep chewing on my metal piercing stud without noticing lol, eyes twitching every now and then which hasn&#039;t happened before but it&#039;s easy to control so no problem. The horrible cottonmouth went away for the most part. No change in paranoia yet but I haven&#039;t been around or talked to anyone but I&#039;m sure I&#039;d have extreme paranoia if I did, &quot;Shit, I&#039;m shaking, they&#039;re gonna know I&#039;m on something!&quot; which wasn&#039;t a problem at first but with re-dosing side effects come out more obviously so shaking is noticable, little to no pupil dilatation for me unless it&#039;s a dark room but that&#039;s normal anyways, I can feel the vasoconstriction increasing in my left arm, I&#039;ve been extremely sociable,&nbsp; been talking to people on Facebook chat nonstop, paragraph after paragraph of bullshit no one cares about but as usual I can&#039;t stop typing so much even though I&#039;m aware I&#039;m probably annoying them. I don&#039;t know about masturbation/sex on this batch, last batch had me up for 8 hours nonstop until I had to go to school and I just thought about porn all day with a sore dick, I tried a while ago but got bored and wanted to just talk to people so I decided not to, which is good for me because I&#039;m always convinced I&#039;m gonna have a heart attack so I try to refrain from doing that but there was no &quot;stimdick&quot; which was pretty fucking surprising to me, almost hard as usual (remember, this is after 12 hours of PV) I didn&#039;t understand how I feel constriction in my left arm begin, yet still able to get it up. lol If I get past thoughts of definite heart attack and try that, I&#039;ll update again, but I doubt it. I honestly can&#039;t say how potent this is, I try my best to eyeball doses from 5-15mg each bump. By potent, I meant based on the amount, as in 5mg being strong, I do somewhere between 5-15mg so I couldn&#039;t accurately weigh 5mg and tell you if that amount is stronger than a 5mg bump of the last stuff. I can say, however, it&#039;s AS GOOD, or better than the last batch in my opinion, maybe someone can notice the difference in strength.<br /><br />I&#039;m mainly writing this to give others an idea of how this new stuff is, usually everyone is different but maybe it&#039;ll be interesting at least. <br />So after 12 hours so far, nothing much changed besides vasoconstriction starting to happen and side effects happening more (way more jittery than when i started), my heart rate seems to be fine, was really high but somehow slowed down a bit, still above average bpm. It sucks how on PV you can&#039;t tell if your heart is fine or if you&#039;re about to have a fucking heart attack, heart rate is the main thing I&#039;m always paranoid about, and the more I think about it, the more I get these imaginary feelings of my heart hurting, then the other thing I worry about is&nbsp; my left arm turning blue or thinking I&#039;d need to have it cut off, but it&#039;s easy to deal with and only starts after somewhere over 10 hours. <br /><br />Hey bbbvvvbbbvvv, let me know if you tried it yet, let me know how the comedown is so I know what to expect in a while? I have no benzos so I&#039;m pretty much fucked, all I have to fight it is...water and vitamins, no help. I was hoping someone would reply saying it&#039;s not horrible, but oh well. Consequences come from fun, I assume you know how that goes though, just one bump and that leads to tomorrow coming in 5 minutes, lol.<br /><br />If I&#039;m the first one to experience the comedown, I&#039;ll write about it after it&#039;s over with, I was hoping someone tried it already, but I might end up being first, QD kept her word so far, this batch is great, but I&#039;m always terrified of the comedown and keep doing more knowing it&#039;ll just make it even worse. I&#039;ll give a rating on -/10 when I&#039;m finished and survive the expected comedown of sorrow.<br /><br /><br />^ Laid here reading/typnig,&nbsp; making small changes to this reply for 30 minutes or so because my mind felt it wasn&#039;t complete unless I type a million words, THAT is also annoying, I&#039;d throw this info in up there but I need to stop wasting time writing this, but on chat sites like Facebook or Skype, I can type a paragraph to reply in 5 seconds, I try to post something on here and I have to keep editing it and adding more because I feel like I&#039;m the only one who can understand it if it&#039;s too simple, weird right, lol, . If you wanna have a good conversation with friends for hours, PV is the way to go. lol

				Final update, I think I can post short replies now without going over everything or adding on.<br /><br />Comedown was different, last batch made me feel dead and gave me the feeling of almost passing out. <br />My &quot;binge&quot; was from 5:00PM Wednesday - 9:00AM Thursday, 16 hours about. I expected something much worse, especially having no benzos really worried me. I started getting the depressing/not wanting to do anything feeling so I stayed in bed, I realized it&#039;d might help to prepare if I eat something, so I microwaved some raviolis and forced myself to eat even though at this point food tripped me the fuck out. My stomach hurt a little but probably just because I hadn&#039;t eaten in so long before that, I tried taking 2 Melatonin for sleep, but could only swallow one so I took the other one about 30 mins later after almost throwing up from trying to take it. A little psychosis snuck up on me, I laid in bed early this morning staring at my curtains, I could see the blinds on the other side from the sun shining through, and after I stared at them for so long, I saw them as crayons for some reason (the sun shining on the blinds which look kinda rectangle-shaped which was probably why), then after focusing on it more, the curtains looked like a big pencil/pen holder and the shining rectangles of blinds visible through the curtains looked like crayons and the eraser halfs of pencils, so weird. I couldn&#039;t talk to anyone so I just remained in bed, I was able to fall asleep about 2 hours of my last dose surprisingly, but the Melatonin was probably a big factor.<br />Overall, comedown made me feel kind of crazy, and depressing, but was it better than the last batch? YES. Nothing compared to that, and I didn&#039;t even have any benzos to fight it, however I made sure to drink water/some 7-up, took Vitamin E because I take it daily anyways, and forced myself to eat. I seem to be fine after sleeping for only about 6 hours. Not even feeling cloudy-headed anymore and from what I see, my typing seems to be how it usually is. <br />Rating - 9/10, great stuff, described perfectly, I don&#039;t enjoy some newer negative effects, but I did a LOT over that 16 hour period, doing bumps approx. 5-20mg, I had no idea if I was eyeballing accurately or just didn&#039;t care. Be careful though, guys. <br /><br />I wrote this part without being on PV, but I still tried to be detailed. Thanks QD and chembros, going to make an order for some M1 in a few minutes from you guys. :)

				shitwassocash, were you planning on writing a review as well?<br /><br />Also letting people know, sexual effects aren&#039;t as strong as last batch for me, still pretty good though. Could be different for others depending on duration of use, or other factors. <br />Psychosis seems to sneak up on me faster as well, I felt fine and 5 minutes later felt completely different, everyone should be safe when binging though.

				Hey guys, sorry for taking so long to get back to you, but shit&#039;s been crazy. Here&#039;s a nice long review for you.<br /><br />I have never experienced PV before, but I had done a lot of research and decided it was something I&#039;d like to try. I bought a cheap mg scale from China (lol) and it&#039;s pretty much accurate, plus or minus 10 mgs, but I figured that was better than eyeballing it without a point of reference. I got it to use for its anorexic and stimulant qualities, so I&#039;ve been using small doses.<br /><br />The first day, I took 7mg (insufflated) before I left for classes. During the thirty minute drive, I felt my heart rate increase exponentially. The back of my throat was numb where the drip had hit, and I felt nauseous. I was excessively jittery and sick-feeling, but at least I went all day without eating anything except half a grilled cheese sandwich. One of my classes got real boring, so I got up to get some water and it took all of my concentration not to fall down or pass out from my seat to the back of the lecture hall, I was so dizzy. It was not pleasant at all, but I might be more sensitive to the substance than others.<br /><br />The second day I insufflated 3mg, the third day I dissolved 3mg in a small amount of water and drank it. The effect was much milder and more comfortable, but my heart rate was still alarming and there was slight nausea (again, preventing me from eating). I love how it kills any and all desire to eat; my stomach didn&#039;t even hurt from lack of food at any point during these three days. I&#039;ve been experiencing some tachycardia, so I&#039;ve taken the past two days as a break. I&#039;m still waiting for the skipping heartbeats to go away.<br /><br />The comedown wasn&#039;t terrible, probably because of the small amounts and no redosing, but it wasn&#039;t wonderful. I have depression naturally, and this product combined with other stupid reasons has made it worse. I gave 50mg to my tweaker friend to try out, and while he likes it and refers to it as a smoother, shorter-acting Ritalin, he absolutely abhors the comedown. But he&#039;s asking me for more - the urge to redose hits him hard. He has been taking doses between 5mg and 10mg at a time mixed with water orally, and he weighs two-thirds of what I do, so that could play into it.<br /><br />Also: qd/chembros, you&#039;re great, but I&#039;m kind of pissed off at you. Today I got a letter from you (I know it was you, same packaging and zip code/state) containing two potleaf-printed baggies of unknown white powder. I&#039;m guessing it was PV, but since I haven&#039;t had any heads up from you, I can&#039;t be sure. This would be fine and dandy and I would be thankful, but here&#039;s the kicker: you sent it to my home address, NOT THE ADDRESS I GAVE YOU. How did you get this address? Sellers are supposed to delete names and addresses after shipment! To get my home address, you must have saved my name. My parents live here with me, and my mother opened the package. She was shocked, she thought it was anthrax or something (lol) and we decided to throw it out. Next time you decide to do something like this, I (and others, I assume) would greatly appreciate it if you 1) gave a heads up and 2) used the original shipping address. The fact that you kept my name and searched the internet for my address disgusts me and completely violates the principle of anonymity that SR promotes. 5/5 for the product, 1/5 for the conduct.

				Yes, I plan on giving a detailed review! :) Till now I have only had one other MDPV supplier, drpvmd. His shit is usually on point, but while I&#039;m waiting on him to get a super batch in stock, I&#039;m trying others.<br /><br />Based on both of your reviews, chembros mdpv sounds like what I experienced with drpvmd&#039;s stash. Felt nearly exactly as you described, which makes me excited to get my order. :) :)<br /><br /><br />not sure what to think about what bbbbbvvvv experienced... why would they do that? seems so crazy.

				Interesting, bbbbbvvvv. Nausea and the scary heart rate is usual for me, I&#039;ve just learned to deal with it. The worst part of doing PV for me is being able to be extremely hungry but just not wanting to eat while others just don&#039;t get hungry at all, and good for using a scale, I eyeball doses poorly underestimating PV when I haven&#039;t had it in a while so I&#039;ll do 5mg and enjoy it, but other times do a very small &quot;line&quot; of 15-20mg and just be spaced out and paranoid all day without any fun. She should have been more careful with your address, that could&#039;ve ended up bad. I don&#039;t think she saves addresses, I&#039;m pretty sure she keeps them just during your order time to around shipping to assure you get it and have it tracked if needed. And did you even make that order? I like it better when she uses the really small baggies, easier to get out with a key etc. and it&#039;s hard to put into a smaller baggie because it sticks to anything.

But the point is that she figured out my home address, which I had NOT sent her when I placed the order; the only way I see this as possible is that she saved my name and used a search engine to find the address connected to it.

				OKay so i got some of that mdpv from qd a while back and i&#039;ve never tried it yet but i did taste it with my tongue. Kinda weird since i&#039;m used to the way coke or meth tastes! I normally prefer crystal meth but i got this as an experimental alternative. I&#039;ve only read about this. What would be the best method to ingest this stuff? I was thinking snorting? But if i can put it in my meth pipe i will. I&#039;d rather have a little light shed on this drug before going balls deep and wind up in the er or some other crazy shit.<br />Oh does it lead to any hallucinating? That would be good to know before hand as well.<br />Thanks&nbsp;

				I read a lot about it before I ordered, and among my research I&#039;m pretty sure I came across some forum posts strongly suggesting against smoking it. Apparently when you burn it, shit gets nasty. <br /><br />As far as hallucinating goes - you&#039;ll probably hallucinate if you get to the point of stimulant psychosis. So, yes?

				order shipped on the 16th, express domestic. nothing yet. hope nothing went wrong.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used MDPV I would guess about half a dozen times now... I go through not even 50mg in an all night binge, and it is more than enough. No hallucinations for me, but it&#039;s impossible to sleep after without benzos or trams or something. :) hope this helps.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: saw a feedback on their profile that says express takes just as long as regular for whatever reason. :) so that&#039;s alright.

				Despite my thoughts about you, shitwassocash, it&#039;s ridiculous to not get your money back and punish a dishonest vendor because you&#039;re worried about your stats. Stats are a guideline for vendors not a rule set in stone and they will understand completely.

I get that you reached out to QD cause chembros was fucking up so much, but why didn&#039;t chembros get in touch with you to resolve your MDPV order and get your address? Why does QD have to be the middleman so you can get your info to chembros? Why can&#039;t chembros communicate with customers if she needs to?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />These guys need to get their shit together, asap. I&#039;m losing my patience.

				First, let me preface my post with this:&nbsp; This will be incredible long, there’s a tl:dr at the end if you don’t like reading long shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you’re anxious about an order from Chembros, this post will probably ease your mind SOMEWHAT.&nbsp; I know no post on an anonymous board by someone with like 5 posts isn’t ever going to completely assure you that Chembros is legit, but a post this detailed and specific that deals with a very recent transaction would have eased my mind while I was waiting for my order to come in.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, if you haven’t guessed by now this is about a successful MDPV order from Chembros.&nbsp; I have tried to include every little detail I could think of, both so that you get an accurate picture of how every aspect of the experience was for me, and also I thought that by providing as many details as possible it would help you know I’m a real customer and not just some fake account set up by Chembros.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Mini tl;dr for this next superfluous paragraph: Shroomlord is my SR username.&nbsp; My forum account of the same name was banned for some BS, thus, my current forum username.<br /><br />Also, about my forum account: my SR username is Shroomlord.&nbsp; My forum account of the same name was permabanned on literally my first post.&nbsp; It was my first time on the forums, I saw a post for a great deal on coin (yes, the btkoin spam), and replied to the post asking if the person who posted it had actually bought coin from the site, because it sounded too good to be true.&nbsp; My post was deleted and I was permabanned.&nbsp; I messaged a forum mod about it from this account, but shroomlord is still banned.&nbsp; Upon further reflection, I realized at least one of the FORUM mods (caps because I want to be sure you don’t think I’m accusing an SR main site mod) had to be in on it.&nbsp; Otherwise how could I have gotten banned over it?&nbsp; If I’m wrong and there’s some way a regular user can get another user banned, please let me know and I’ll stop thinking a forum mod was in on the btkoin scam.&nbsp; So, that’s the reason for the disparity in user names.&nbsp; I’ve thought about pming a forum mod who I know wasn’t in on it (Inigo, or even DPR perhaps) to ask for Shroomlord to be unbanned, but I know they’re super busy and this seems trivial.&nbsp; Also, I’m warming up to unjustlybanned.&nbsp; It gives me another story to tell, and I’m sure you can tell I like to tell stories.<br /><br />So, early Monday morning (around 2 a.m.) I placed an order for 1g mdpv.&nbsp; I read their vendor profile and saw they prefer privnote.&nbsp; I&#039;m new both here and on SR (1 month there, 2 sucessful transactions at the time of order, 6 now [I think this is important because with so few transactions I believe I was a ripe target for selective scamming]), but I&#039;ve mastered pgp and thought I&#039;d try the other method of address obfuscation that people use.&nbsp; While I was on privnote.com I noticed I could have an e-mail sent when my note is read.&nbsp; I checked the box and used my tor e-mail address.<br /><br />Ok, so literally immediately after placing my order I found this thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cue panic and regret!<br /><br />I read through this thread and came very close to pressing the &quot;cancel&quot; button, but I was worried that would count as a &quot;refund&quot; and fuck up my stats.&nbsp; So, I completely understand where you&#039;re coming from Shitwassocash (great name btw).&nbsp; I only had two transactions at that point and ~$30 wasn&#039;t worth having a 33/3% refund rate.&nbsp; &nbsp;I now know that if I had cancelled the transaction at that point (before a vendor marks an order “in transit”), you get a full refund automatically and it doesn’t count against your stats.&nbsp; After it’s marked in transit, the vendor can cancel the order without it affecting your stats, too.&nbsp; It’s only if you take it to SR resolution to get a refund that count against your stats.&nbsp; I only know this from research, though.&nbsp; If anyone has any experiences that contradict this, please let me know.<br /><br />At any rate, I decided to let it ride and see if Chembros came through or not.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, on Monday night around 11 p.m. my privnote message was read.&nbsp; 21 hours after order… left a little to be desired, but addressing the package within 24 hours is acceptable to me.&nbsp; I took this as encouraging; if Chembros was just scamming me why would they even bother reading the privnote message?&nbsp; Then I realized that there was another possible reason for reading the message: What if Chembros is LE?!? <br /><br />Lol, after the paranoia calmed down a bit, I reasoned that LE really wouldn&#039;t target buyers on the road, and worse-case-scenario if they busted a seller, and the seller was dickish enough to give them access to their SR account, even then they probably wouldn&#039;t be busting people ordering a gram of PV, they&#039;d use the sellers good rep to list crazy deals on large quantities of the drugs they really want to bust ($4000 for a key of coke, guise!&nbsp; Etc…), and bust the people who ordered large quantities of the “hard” drugs.&nbsp; That’s just what I came up with by putting myself in their shoes, playing a little devil’s advocate.&nbsp; Pure speculation, but that’s what I’d do if I were DEA with access to a legit seller’s account, which I also speculate is the only real danger you’d have as a buyer.&nbsp; LE could never start a vendors account and build good rep for themselves because they can’t send real drugs themselves through the mail.&nbsp; It’s one thing to intercept an already-sent pacakage and attempt to deliver in a controlled way, but putting real drugs into the mail is something they just can’t do.&nbsp; What if it got lost/mis-delivered and some kid found it?&nbsp; They can’t take that risk.&nbsp; Maybe LE are on SR buying, but I’m 100% certain that they’re not on the road selling.&nbsp; Wow, this is good PV, and that was a lot of speculation and rambling.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;Again, there’s a tl;dr if this is too much for you.<br /><br />About an hour after the privnote was read, the order was marked in transit.&nbsp; I checked their vendor page every day, and I saw the review from the guy who said he IV&#039;s his PV, and that this stuff wasn&#039;t PV.&nbsp; <br /><br />This was disheartening.&nbsp; If an IV user said it was crap, then maybe they really are scammers.&nbsp; After all, an IV user would know his shit, right?&nbsp; That’s a serious commitment (IV drug use in general), and if he says he did .5 then went to bed, wtf am I going to get off of just insufflation?&nbsp; More doubts were sown, but at this point all I could do was wait and if nothing came, I’d decide whether or not to take it to resolution at that time.&nbsp; <br /><br />All I can figure is maybe he got the wrong shipment, they do sell a lot of stuff, and mine wasn&#039;t labeled at all (the baggie didn&#039;t have any labeling, the package was of course labeled.) so maybe Chembros fucked up and gave him the wrong stuff.&nbsp; I haven’t tried any of the other “PV replacements” such as a-pvp, but I’ve heard it isn’t nearly as potent as PV so maybe that’s what he got?&nbsp; Don’t want to call the dude a liar, but there’s no disputing that I received legit MDPV of awesome strength.&nbsp; I couldn’t imagine snorting half a g of this in a night, let alone IVing half a g, then going to bed as that person claimed.&nbsp; Just to be clear, I’ve never IV’d anything, but I understand it is much more efficient than insufflation (snorting, which is my method).<br /><br />Anyway, I received it today with the mail, and it is definitely good PV.&nbsp; <br /><br />A little bit more about the quality:&nbsp; <br /><br />I haven&#039;t done PV since the ban (I used to order from source1herbs before the ban), so I don&#039;t have any tolerance.&nbsp; When I did do PV before, I was ordering 100g at a time (minimum order from source1), and I&#039;d do about 4 or 5 of the grams before all the rest would sell and I&#039;d re-up.&nbsp; So I guess that means I&#039;d do about 4 or 5 g a month, sometimes as little as two weeks. I didn’t keep super accurate track at the time of my personal use, but I definitely felt like I was doing it too much, so I was somewhat relieved when I couldn&#039;t get it any more. <br /><br />The reason I ordered PV from here once I found and learned about SR is that I noticed there really isn&#039;t any withdrawal like there is with other “hard” substances.&nbsp; I was addicted to coke for about six months maybe 7 or 8 years ago, and stopping PV was cake compared to coke.&nbsp; I wanted coke for at least a year after I quit, and I still think it’d be hard to turn it down if I was offered a line for free at a party or something.&nbsp; With PV, I was depressed that I couldn’t get it any more for a few days, but there wasn’t that chemical “need” for the substance.&nbsp; It is addictive while you’re high, though. <br /><br />All that to say this:&nbsp; I think I&#039;ve done my fair share of PV and I think I&#039;m qualified to say that this is fucking good PV.&nbsp; At least as good as what I was getting from source1, possibly even BETTER if you can believe that.&nbsp; I am basing the &quot;maybe better&quot; statement on this line of thought: with the pv I got from source1, I did MUCH, MUCH bigger bumps and even lines sometimes.&nbsp; I&#039;m as high now as I ever was off their PV and I&#039;ve only done two tiny, tiny bumps (and it’s probably been an hour since dosing).&nbsp; They were literally the smallest bumps I could get on the tip of my pocket knife.&nbsp; I’ll see f I can research how to take pics and post them in onionland scrubbed of all identifying data.&nbsp; If I can feel 100% safe about it I’d be willing to post pics to show you both the product and size of bump I’m talking about. Until then, please just imagine a little bigger than a pinhead sized bump.&nbsp; <br /><br />The reason I say it MIGHT be better than source1 is because I did have a tolerance back then, and after a year away from the substance, I certainly don’t now.&nbsp; I will also add this, though: before I found source1 I bought PV irl from someone who was selling it as “speed” and cut it a LOT, to make it about as potent as speed.&nbsp; When I first tried Source1’s product, I was just as blown away by the quality as I am now.&nbsp; Is it possible that I went from like 5%PV/95%cut (about what my IRL dealer sold), to something like 70%PV/30%cut (what Source1’s PV feels like in comparison to this), then finally getting pure PV from Chembros?&nbsp; Seems more likely Source1 and Chembros are both pure and the discrepancy is tolerance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tl;dr: (this is also basically what my feedback on the product page says) <br /><br />Appearance:&nbsp; The PV is white, and super fine.&nbsp; Looking at it through my home-made loupe (instructions here: http://www.diyphotography.net/super-macro-your-cellphone-camera-with-a-dvd-lens ), there seems to be only one kind of crystal, and it&#039;s tiny, tiny little crystals.&nbsp; <br /><br />Weight: 1.1g, thanks for the point, Chembros!&nbsp; Scale only goes to .1g, so I can&#039;t give more accurate weight, sorry guys!<br /><br />Quality: I believe I&#039;ve already waxed poetic enough above, but if you&#039;re only reading the tl:dr: it&#039;s fuckin&#039; GOOD!<br /><br />Shipping: 4 day total shipping time! (1 day processing, which was Monday, postmarked Tuesday, and hit my box Thursday)<br /><br />Stealth:&nbsp; The only negative thing I could say about the whole shebang is that the stealth could have been better.&nbsp; It was fine as far as I&#039;m concerned, but I know some of you have higher standards than I.&nbsp; Some details: Printed labels, clever return address, but no vacuum seal.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary for PV, but I know some of you guys want everything vacuum sealed x2 regardless of the product.<br /><br />Overall, fucking fantastic PV and I will definitely be ordering again.&nbsp; The only reason to order from anyone else is if you wanted to wait a long ass time and get huge quantity from overseas.&nbsp; If you want your PV quick, clean, and correct, go with Chembros!<br />

				Finished the novella. :P Thank you unjustly. The details actually do help a lot. They confirm what I&#039;ve been thinking the past two days (that I was wrong about being selectively scammed) and also, I&#039;ve had PV from elsewhere that is exactly like you describe, so I&#039;m psyched to buy some of chembros product. The review of their quality/shipping will definitely help prospective buyers as well.<br /><br /><br />Apology to chembros redacted.&nbsp; She insists she shipped my order (can&#039;t prove it despite it being an express shipping), offers me a reship if I order again.&nbsp; Going by their back and forth shady behavior with me and them ignoring me for so long, I&#039;m pretty sure my order was never sent. Never had a problem with this address and its domestic so it would have arrived. If I&#039;m wrong, please show me proof of shipment and I&#039;ll finalize.

				I spoke too soon.<br /><br />Chembros is jerking me around, sticking true to her story that she shipped without being able to prove it.<br /><br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />They offered a reship with my next order or 50% refund. <br /><br />I don&#039;t understand the offer. If they shipped my order, why are they so willing to reship or refund? Just show the tracking from the express shipment (or any proof it was sent) and you don&#039;t owe me any product/money.<br /><br />Why not just reship alone (it&#039;s not really a reship, I&#039;m near certain it was never sent) without having me place another order?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m taking them up on the offer to reship, so let&#039;s see. If they can show me at any time that my first order was shipped, they don&#039;t have to give me 2gs free in this new order.<br /><br /><br /><br />On its own, this offer wouldn&#039;t be fishy to me, but in combination with everything else... I ordered during a time they claimed to be &quot;in the red&quot; and customers were FEing. They&#039;ve ignored me for 3 weeks, now that I am in touch with them it&#039;s been crazy and back and forth.<br />

				Still getting jerked around by chembros. So tired of this. Resolution will get decided by SR tonight.<br /><br /><br /><br />I placed a new order, hoping that they will either a.) send the 2gs from my first order with it, as they said they would do in resolution, or b.) just ship me this 1g and provide tracking so I don&#039;t have to wait and get ignored for another month.<br /><br />No response yet.<br /><br />I will finalize for both orders if she either<br /><br />1.) Gives tracking or evidence that the first order was shipped (even if it was lost or stolen in transit)<br />2.) Gives tracking for my new order and packages the 2gs from the first order with it. (will pay extra for tracking if needed)<br /><br /><br />She keeps going back and forth. First she says that it was infact shipped and sorry it hasn&#039;t arrived yet. Then she says to give her the info again and she will pull tracking.<br /><br />I have no idea what to believe or what&#039;s going on with these guys and my order. I&#039;ve been EXTREMELY patient and more than fair. Never gotten into it like this with any other vendor, and perfect buying stats. I&#039;m really not trying to scam for 2g of MDPV. I have several international orders in place right now, I&#039;m doing fine as far as money and product.

				Well, I just found this thread... guess it&#039;s time to throw my story into the pile.<br /><br />So back in October (I believe it was the 28th or 29th) I ordered a sample of pyrovalerone capsules from QD. I received my order super quickly (on Nov 1st), however, I didn&#039;t get what I paid for. I got a small baggie of white powder; still not totally sure what it is, but due to some words scribbled down inside the packaging I believe it was a half gram of pentedrone. I was a little confused and annoyed, but I figured whatever, no big deal. These things happen. I had to FE due to it being my first ever order on SR, but since QD had good feedback I was confident she&#039;d make it right.<br /><br />So I contacted her right away, asking how we could resolve the issue. I waited a few days with no response. I shot over another message and waited a few more days. Still no response. I was getting pretty annoyed, but I knew she was supposed to be moving around then so I stayed patient. Finally, over a week after the initial message was sent, I got a message back from her saying that I needed to send her my address again, what I had ordered, and what I received. Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t get to see that message right away because SR was having connectivity issues around then, but I read it a few days later when SR came back up. After supplying the requested information and requesting an answer about how it would be dealt with, she went silent once more. I knew she got my message and address because I was notified by privnote that my message was read the same day I sent it.<br /><br />(I just want to clarify here that I&#039;m not stupid enough to send my address unencrypted through privnote. I always encrypt my address, put it in a privnote msg, then encrypt my message to the vendor with the privnote url and send that through PM. That way even if the PM logs remain, the encrypted address is at least not as easily connected to it. I realize and fully admit this might be weird or excessive.)<br /><br />Anyway, another full week goes by with no response and no replacement order. What the hell is going on? I sent her another message inquiring about the situation. A couple more days pass and she gets back to me saying that she was out of town and would be returning that Monday. She said if she didn&#039;t contact me on Monday, I should contact her again and she&#039;d get back to me ASAP. Well, I know this might come as a shock to all of you, but she didn&#039;t contact me on Monday. I gave her a little more slack, since it&#039;s possible she might live in some sort of alternate dimension time paradox where Monday comes after Tuesday or something. After work on Tuesday, I logged in to see another day had gone by with no response or no replacement shipment. I sent her another (admittedly more sternly worded) message to ask what was going to be done. At this point she hadn&#039;t even confirmed what she planned to do to rectify the problem.<br /><br />Yet another few days of radio silence transpired, then she sent me a reply offering to send me a full order of pills if only she had my address. For those of you keeping score, this is the third time I had to send my address over to her. I don&#039;t know about you, but I&#039;d prefer not to be sending out my name and shipping address to some apparently inept (or at the very least, disorganized) stranger multiple times (over one instance that should have been resolved already) in connection to illicit activities. I sent my info over one more time, and asked her to let me know when they were sent and to confirm that the order would still be coming out of the US. A couple of days later, I get another message from her confirming domestic shipping, but noticed she still hadn&#039;t accessed my address privnote. I asked what was up with that, and she replied a day later saying they&#039;d been sent. At this point it was December 4th.<br /><br />I finally received my replacement shipment yesterday, 12/8. When retrieving it from the mailbox, I immediately noticed some weirdness about the envelope. Externally it looked pretty innocuous, but when picking it up I could feel and hear grittiness inside the envelope. I brought it inside and left it alone for a while, mostly because I had shit to do for the rest of the day. I finally got a chance to open it this afternoon and see what was inside. I believe I got the right thing this time (haven&#039;t actually sampled yet), but at some point during shipment one of the capsules had come apart, and the powdered contents leaked out all over the envelope. Not sure if this was directly due to the packaging or the capsule not being tamped down hard enough, but I&#039;d guess the latter. Since the capsules weren&#039;t even ziplock bagged or anything, it&#039;s entirely possible some of the contents leaked out of the external envelope during transit, but I didn&#039;t actually witness that. I transferred the remaining product out of its packaging and tossed it.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing since this letter came out of the US, it was actually chembros who packaged it. If you&#039;re reading this girlfriend, I would recommend at least bagging those capsules up so they&#039;re not rolling around all willy-nilly.<br /><br />In conclusion, this experience was pretty drawn out and quite a hassle. The packaging for the replacement order was disappointing and a bit worrisome. I&#039;m honestly pretty surprised my mailman didn&#039;t get suspicious over the feel of the envelope. I know QD and chem are trying, and their hearts seem to be in the right place, but they need to step their games up. I&#039;m unsure if I&#039;d ever order from them again, but I&#039;m not writing them off completely. I&#039;m also never FE&#039;ing again.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71428.msg652447#msg652447">Quote from: kottimi on December 10, 2012, 02:25 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well, I just found this thread... guess it&#039;s time to throw my story into the pile.<br /><br />So back in October (I believe it was the 28th or 29th) I ordered a sample of pyrovalerone capsules from QD. I received my order super quickly (on Nov 1st), however, I didn&#039;t get what I paid for. I got a small baggie of white powder; still not totally sure what it is, but due to some words scribbled down inside the packaging I believe it was a half gram of pentedrone. I was a little confused and annoyed, but I figured whatever, no big deal. These things happen. I had to FE due to it being my first ever order on SR, but since QD had good feedback I was confident she&#039;d make it right.<br /><br />So I contacted her right away, asking how we could resolve the issue. I waited a few days with no response. I shot over another message and waited a few more days. Still no response. I was getting pretty annoyed, but I knew she was supposed to be moving around then so I stayed patient. Finally, over a week after the initial message was sent, I got a message back from her saying that I needed to send her my address again, what I had ordered, and what I received. Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t get to see that message right away because SR was having connectivity issues around then, but I read it a few days later when SR came back up. After supplying the requested information and requesting an answer about how it would be dealt with, she went silent once more. I knew she got my message and address because I was notified by privnote that my message was read the same day I sent it.<br /><br />(I just want to clarify here that I&#039;m not stupid enough to send my address unencrypted through privnote. I always encrypt my address, put it in a privnote msg, then encrypt my message to the vendor with the privnote url and send that through PM. That way even if the PM logs remain, the encrypted address is at least not as easily connected to it. I realize and fully admit this might be weird or excessive.)<br /><br />Anyway, another full week goes by with no response and no replacement order. What the hell is going on? I sent her another message inquiring about the situation. A couple more days pass and she gets back to me saying that she was out of town and would be returning that Monday. She said if she didn&#039;t contact me on Monday, I should contact her again and she&#039;d get back to me ASAP. Well, I know this might come as a shock to all of you, but she didn&#039;t contact me on Monday. I gave her a little more slack, since it&#039;s possible she might live in some sort of alternate dimension time paradox where Monday comes after Tuesday or something. After work on Tuesday, I logged in to see another day had gone by with no response or no replacement shipment. I sent her another (admittedly more sternly worded) message to ask what was going to be done. At this point she hadn&#039;t even confirmed what she planned to do to rectify the problem.<br /><br />Yet another few days of radio silence transpired, then she sent me a reply offering to send me a full order of pills if only she had my address. For those of you keeping score, this is the third time I had to send my address over to her. I don&#039;t know about you, but I&#039;d prefer not to be sending out my name and shipping address to some apparently inept (or at the very least, disorganized) stranger multiple times (over one instance that should have been resolved already) in connection to illicit activities. I sent my info over one more time, and asked her to let me know when they were sent and to confirm that the order would still be coming out of the US. A couple of days later, I get another message from her confirming domestic shipping, but noticed she still hadn&#039;t accessed my address privnote. I asked what was up with that, and she replied a day later saying they&#039;d been sent. At this point it was December 4th.<br /><br />I finally received my replacement shipment yesterday, 12/8. When retrieving it from the mailbox, I immediately noticed some weirdness about the envelope. Externally it looked pretty innocuous, but when picking it up I could feel and hear grittiness inside the envelope. I brought it inside and left it alone for a while, mostly because I had shit to do for the rest of the day. I finally got a chance to open it this afternoon and see what was inside. I believe I got the right thing this time (haven&#039;t actually sampled yet), but at some point during shipment one of the capsules had come apart, and the powdered contents leaked out all over the envelope. Not sure if this was directly due to the packaging or the capsule not being tamped down hard enough, but I&#039;d guess the latter. Since the capsules weren&#039;t even ziplock bagged or anything, it&#039;s entirely possible some of the contents leaked out of the external envelope during transit, but I didn&#039;t actually witness that. I transferred the remaining product out of its packaging and tossed it.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing since this letter came out of the US, it was actually chembros who packaged it. If you&#039;re reading this girlfriend, I would recommend at least bagging those capsules up so they&#039;re not rolling around all willy-nilly.<br /><br />In conclusion, this experience was pretty drawn out and quite a hassle. The packaging for the replacement order was disappointing and a bit worrisome. I&#039;m honestly pretty surprised my mailman didn&#039;t get suspicious over the feel of the envelope. I know QD and chem are trying, and their hearts seem to be in the right place, but they need to step their games up. I&#039;m unsure if I&#039;d ever order from them again, but I&#039;m not writing them off completely. I&#039;m also never FE&#039;ing again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thank you for conforming the packaging methods. I knew there was too much similarity in the listings. Please post back on what you think of the pv. :)

				ok im gonna post i bought some mdpv only a gram from chembros on the Monday and received it on the Friday. now im pretty new on here&nbsp; but if you question my post ive got my order history on silk road and ive order from other mdpv vendors only two more three more to try ,It arrived internationally withing four days to the uk and the quality was very good i did a line the size of my finger nail very fluffy appearance and very moreish product. Ive been using mdpv for two years and i will say it was a good quality not 98 percent lab pure but good quality .there is definitely some kind of mix in the product, when we washed it up was a yellow tint not sure what that means but i hope this helps anyone whose thinking of ordering or has ordered. im no idiot when it comes to this stuff so please don&#039;t think id promote anyone with a shit product id say it how it is to save anyone else ordering from some of the scam vendors on the road .Also the packaging was discreet and i really had a good experience with the whole order even a little overweight.

				<br />I&#039;ve seen brown, grey, and off white. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve encounterd yellow though. What did pablo get into?<br /><br />Sorry for the long delay i didn&#039;t think i had any replies to my post.Just to throw some clarity in the mix when i said washed i didn&#039;t mean to clean it i meant like i washed it up with bicarb and smoked it as it was forming and beginning to take form had a very yellow colour to it..See in my local area theirs a big rage for something called Dmc now due to the fact that what is sold is not Dmc also known as dimethocaine in fact its a mixture of mdpv benzocaine and procaine and sells for 150 an ounce you do the maths. As well all know Mdpv at a small dose is pretty hardcore stuff if its good quality so i think per kilo there&#039;s only around six ounces of actual Mdpv in the mix and when heated with bicarb at a low temperature and placed in a cool environment it creates a look identical to crack with a slight tint of yellow but when we did chembros in its pure form the colour was alot darker yellow which to us indicated the product quality and i can assure you we had a good night.

				Then we both agree about the quality of the peev from chembros.&nbsp; But you can order the stuff from now to eternity but I don&#039;t think anything is going to ship.&nbsp; I have yet another order that has been &quot;processing&quot; for a few days already.&nbsp; No activity whatsoever from chembros.&nbsp; I hope everything is alright with the two.&nbsp; QD sent me a message a couple of days ago but hasn&#039;t read any of mine since.&nbsp; I had an order with QD as well but it sat for a good 5 days and was still &quot;processing&quot; when I reclaimed the BTC and spent elsewhere.<br /><br />I wonder what&#039;s going on with the two.&nbsp; They seem to randomly show up for a couple of days and &quot;poof&quot; they disappear.&nbsp; Unfortunately their disappearing act is gets longer with each time they disappear.&nbsp; Their rating is suffering the effects of it, too.<br /><br />I was pretty tight with QD until SR crashed in November.&nbsp; Up to that point I was getting message responses within hours and product was arriving within 3 days of ordering.&nbsp; Now, I&#039;m lucky if the order ever moves out of &quot;processing&quot; status.
