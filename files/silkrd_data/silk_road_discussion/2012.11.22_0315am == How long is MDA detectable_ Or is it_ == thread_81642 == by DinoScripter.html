				Ecstasy Drug tests<br />A person may be asked to take a drug test as a condition of employment or after he or she has been hired. Some employers ask workers to submit to random drug tests, while others will only request one if there is a suspicion that an employee is using. No matter what the reason for the test, it&#039;s a good idea to have a basic idea about how drug testing for XTC works.<br />CLEARNET WARNING: CLICK HERE FOR TABLE http://shareimage.ro/images/l7ctwq9quzenov8ic1.png !<br />Urine Tests for Drug Screening<br />Urine tests are commonly used to test for drugs because they are relatively inexpensive and easy to conduct. They can usually detect the presence of drugs used within seven days before the test being conducted. In the case of a person who has been using a drug like EX, regularly, the results will indicate drug use before the one-week period.<br />Standard urine tests conducted by a facility may be tested for temperature as well as the presence of drugs. The temperature check is to confirm that the sample was provided by the individual being tested and not switched with someone else&#039;s urine in an effort to beat the test.<br />The urine sample given by the individual being tested is used to detect toxins that remain in the body after illegal drugs are used. The toxins are stored in the fat cells. When the fat is burned in the body, the toxins are released into the bloodstream. Once the toxins reach the bloodstream, they are filtered through the kidneys. Eventually, they are excreted from the body in urine.<br />Love Drug and Urine Tests<br />MDMA is not tested specifically for in the standard urine drug tests. However, MDMA users do test positive for amphetamines (the two drugs are chemically similar). Also, many tablets of street ecstasy are not pure MDMA and frequently include amphetamines or ephedrine, which will show up in a test. MDMA is usually detectable in urine for 24-72 hours after use.<br />The exact time that EX will stay in a person&#039;s body is difficult to estimate, since the rate at which the toxins will break down depends on a number of factors, including:<br />How often the drug was used.<br />How much was taken.<br />Body size.<br />Amount of body fat.<br />Metabolism<br />Fluid intake<br />How to Pass an Ecstasy Urine Test<br />Many people who have experimented with EX wonder if there is a way for them to beat a drug test for ecstasy by looking for a solution online. The Internet is chock full of information, and not all of it is accurate or helpful.<br />The ecstasy discussion board frequently contains active discussions on the various aspects of screening for ecstasy.<br />There are web sites offering tips that supposedly will help someone beat an ecstasy drug test. They suggest things like smuggling someone else&#039;s urine into the testing facility or trying to water down the specimen by drinking large amounts of fluids or trying to water down the urine sample by liquid from the toilet or a tap in the washroom when the sample is given. Some web sites are selling solutions that purport to help someone beat a drug test.<br />The problem with trying these measures to beat the test is that drug testing facilities are very much aware that people will try to do avoid testing positive and have taken measures to deal with this issue. They may ask an individual being tested to put on a hospital gown so that there is no place to hide an &quot;extra&quot; urine sample. The water in the toilets will likely have a colored dye added to it, which eliminates them as a source of extra fluid to add to a urine sample being given. The water to the taps in the washroom used to gather samples will probably be turned off, which also eliminates them as a way to help someone beat an XTC urine test.<br />Products being sold as a way to beat a drug test are suspect. The consumer doesn&#039;t really know what he or she is buying, and there is no evidence that these concoctions will do what they say they will do.
