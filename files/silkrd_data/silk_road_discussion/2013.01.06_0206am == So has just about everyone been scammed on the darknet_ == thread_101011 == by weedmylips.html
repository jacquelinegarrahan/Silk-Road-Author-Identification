				I haven&#039;t been scammed either, but I tend to be conservative with my orders and go with highly reviewed vendors.

				I got scammed on my first order with duderugs and lost $600 which nearly put me out for good, but I eventually found the forums and realised I should have gone there first. Ever since then I have based my decisions largely on what people are saying on here more so than a vendors profile feedback. As Astor said, when you find a good vendor whom you trust, then you stick with them.

				not on SR or any darknet site yet, once a few years ago on a clearnet drug buying site I did but got a refund from paypal. pretty good at spotting scams.<br /><br />some scams I honestly wonder how people can get fooled by them when they&#039;re so obvious.

				These are my stats as of today Januarty 6th<br /><br />Total transactions: 41<br />Total spent: $12322.23<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 4.36%<br />Member for: 2 months<br /><br />When you first start in SR you have to take a Leap of Faith, you dont know if your product will be good or if the vendor will actually ship your drugs. You have to take a leap of faith, its like when you buy street drugs and you dont know the dealer that well, or if his products are as what he advertises, we had to go through those who at a young age started getting drugs from street dealers.<br />Lucky for me on SR i have never been scammed, I only went to resolution center twice so far, but just to extend due dates because of christmas delays. <br />When i first started,&nbsp; lucky for me i found trusted vendors who i had to FE with, none of them scammed me. There was only 1 order that it never got to me 1g of MDMA, but that was when i first started 2 months ago, and i was like a kid with a new toy with SR, so i ordered a lot of shit from different vendors and sometimes the same stuff, so i got some MDMA, but there was only one package missing of MDMA but i will never know whose package was, because they all were from the same country , haha.<br />Nowdays, im not required to FE by most vendors and we remain in ESCROW , and i even FE sometimes with my favourite vendors even though im not required to do so.<br />My tips for SR are:<br /><br />1. Always stay in ESCROW whenever possible.<br />2. If you find quality vendors STICK with them, you dont want to use a new vendors whose stealth packaging methods are not known for you, they can fuck up bigtime and flag your address forever. Which could lead to packages not arriving to you from your quality vendors!<br />3. Dont trust ANY of the bitcoins threads that have been around the forums lately, because they are all scammers.<br />

				I&#039;ve been on the road since last spring, first as a buyer, then a vendor. Scammed twice as a buyer, lost under $100 each time. And believe it or not, only 2 reships and I haven&#039;t had to refund anyone in over 300 transactions!! I do think it has to do with what&#039;s being sold, and the type of folks it brings to the table. The more research you do about your purchase, the better your chance of everything going smooth.

				I am so interested in how the whole lot will come out over the next few years. There has to be a secure way to weed out the real vendors and customers from the scammers. SR is a great start. Ar for BMR or other dark web sites??????<br /><br />No matter where you go there are scammers galore, add complete anonymity, international access &amp; no financial trace...... Well there are 7 Billion people in this world, just think if only 0.00001% of people are scammers - it&#039;s like moths to a flame.<br /><br />As a Customer, I think if you can find 3-4 reputable vendors and stick to them you can develop good long standing relationships, your on the money. <br />As a Vendor, Do right by your customers, be honest and reasonable about the product and price, and you&#039;ll have more business than you can handle, especially at this early stage of the dark web. <br /><br />

				My first purchase was from SuperTrips for 10g MDMA back in April when he was a new vendor. I&nbsp; FE&#039;d to get 10% more on my order...BIG mistake..it took 9 weeks for me to get my order.I had received on a re-ship ..but I had sent him a payment for tracking and I received 9 days later. Dr NyX almost scammed me when I once ordered from him he cancelled my order giving me a refund and I had lost coin. The reason for him cancelling was cuz he ran out of stock. 1 week later he sent me a 5g sample and told me to send him a payment once I receive. Got my order in 8 days. Then I placed a larger order with him and he marked &quot;in transit &quot; right away..was at the 10 day mark or so and that&#039;s when he stated on his profile that he just got busted and went to jail...he fucked over a lot of people !! I&#039;ve only FE a few times, when I know my order has been sent and only with a reputable vendor. Luckily I haven&#039;t technically lost any money because of a vendor taking my Coin. There have been a few times when I gave Sugar Mama over $4,000 in MP and I was skeptical at first, but she came through n the end! Bottom line is, due your hwk before you make any kind of purchase on the dark net. THANK GOD for the forums. Pe@ce.

				I just started with the SR and hopefully I won&#039;t fall victim to any of the bullshit artist on here. I was about to buy some coins from Einstein777 for moneypak but he was unable to load the moneypak onto any of his cards. I was kind of skeptical about giving him the info before he sent me the coin, but I went ahead and did it because of the feedback that he has as well as a search of the forums. I am glad to say that, even though the deal did not get done, he did everything that he said he would do and I did not get scammed.

				Total transactions: 43<br />Total spent: $4146.93<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 1 year<br /><br />I&#039;ve either been very lucky or just careful but I have a 100% success rate here and even on BMR (just one transaction there). I always go for the more established vendors with longer track records and good feedback and never spend more than I&#039;m willing to lose - I&#039;ve never bought more than 1 oz. of weed at a time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only FE&#039;d a couple of times but only for really good deals and, again, for no more than I&#039;m willing to lose. I should probably stick to less vendors overall, as suggested, in order to keep the number of vendors with my address low but there is just so much variety here that&#039;s hard to do.

				I&#039;ve only been scammed one time with trying to purchase BTCs from a vendor via MP. MY usual vendors were super busy and this guy had great stats but unfortunately I locked myself out of my cart bc I forgot my pin! So, being eager, I sent the MP info to the guy over messages. Never heard from him again on my account....I messaged him a day later of not hearing from him from my brother&#039;s account and he replied immediately saying he could fill the coins. Long story short...I called him out and he denied denied denied. I got him kicked off SR and hopefully he didn&#039;t steal from anyone else! He was a weed vendor as well....so if you see a guy selling btcs for moneypak with reallly really low fees and he also sells pot...it is most likely him so beware! <br /><br />I&#039;m currently dealing with an issue with a lottery vendor so be careful w/ them! There&#039;s no need to reveal his identity until it&#039;s resolved. <br /><br />***Everyone should be very happy to have CaptainMal as a moderator as he is not only an extremely helpful and trustworthy person...but contributes to the SR community greatly!

				I havnt but i&#039;m always ready for it to happen, im just starting to establish good vendors and havnt yet purchased from anyone risky. It&#039;s pretty easy to tell which vendors will be easiest to deal with if theres a problem. Since starting to use SR a few months ago i&#039;ve only had 2 items not turn up, 1 was immediately reshipped and the other was 75% refund, which i was happy with as the vendor had stated on his page that only 50% would be refunded on missing orders. My best advice is to always stay in escrow , you&#039;ll probably be asked to FE on your first few orders, when you&#039;ve had 5 successful purchases, vendors arnt supposed to ask you to FE at all. You do so at your own risk. Alot of vendors use the postage options to let you decide if you want cheap postage w/ FE. Or pay a bit more and stay in escrow. I think this is a little unethical but what can you do. I&#039;ll often opt for the more expensive to stay in escrow, definitely the better option. Some vendors such as nevita offer 10-20% extra on some products if you FE before postage, he&#039;s a 100% reputable guy too, never had a problem with him, he doesnt require FE but appreciates it, and rewards you for it<br /><br />Above all else, the best answer to this topic is use your common sense when purchasing online. And dont consider the road a god-given right. It is a massive privilege, appreciate it nomatter what happens:-) <br /><br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t ever been scammed on SR...I was burned a few times copping on the corners/street when I was young but you get used to the life and all the plays that go on when copping dope and coke in the city so not getting scammed on SR is a piece of cake.<br /><br />If you use your head and always stay in escrow, you&#039;ll never be scammed on here.
