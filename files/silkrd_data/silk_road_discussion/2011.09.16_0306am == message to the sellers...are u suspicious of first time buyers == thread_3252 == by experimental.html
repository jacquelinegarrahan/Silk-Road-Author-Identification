				i&#039;m new to this site...and i&#039;m disappointed my first attempt with a seller and purchase is not going smooth as I wanted.&nbsp; He/she is also a relative new seller with many 5/5 feedbacks, no negative feed-backs and the positive transactions are increasing each time I check this seller&#039;s page.&nbsp; <br />So the issue is that I haven&#039;t received the package I ordered, so I emailed inquiring why and the response was that the package was sent through regular mail and is taking longer than it shoud even though the seller&#039;s page clearly stated that all packages were going to be sent using express mail service with tracking services. <br />The seller apologized for the delay and offered to resend the package using the advertised method if I didn&#039;t get the package in x more number of days, but at this point my interest is waning.&nbsp; <br />So my question to the sellers: Why would this seller do this.&nbsp; <br />Would it be to open up more correspondence to &quot;feel&quot; this first time buyer out? ???<br />

				go to the &quot;rumor mill&quot; and call out your vendor. if your communications are going nowhere with the vendor of course.<br />we need to know if there are potential scammers out there.<br />give detail about attempted or failed communication, name your vendor, if others have had a good experience then they will give input and so forth.<br /><br />good luck

				Honestly, I think you might be over-analyzing the situation a tad bit. I could, of course, be completely wrong about that. However, as a seller, I know that I&#039;m not suspicious at all of first time buyers. I mean, I suppose I do feel just a tiny bit more at ease when somebody places an order with me who&#039;s had 30 successful transactions in the past than I do with somebody who&#039;s had 0 transactions... However, I&#039;d honestly never even think of treating somebody differently just because they&#039;re a first time buyer. It&#039;s certainly no excuse for the seller in question to be failing to follow the standards for quality shipping that they chose to enforce upon themselves.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend simply confronting the seller directly about everything you mentioned in your post... I feel as though it&#039;s the quickest, most direct, &amp; most promising way to go about seeking a resolution to your aforementioned concerns that you feel is satisfactory. &amp;, if a satisfactory resolution unfortunately never is reached, you should certainly keep in mind that this seller WILL have to face some consequences for their less-than-stellar behavior &amp; flakey policies when it comes time for you to leave them feedback.
