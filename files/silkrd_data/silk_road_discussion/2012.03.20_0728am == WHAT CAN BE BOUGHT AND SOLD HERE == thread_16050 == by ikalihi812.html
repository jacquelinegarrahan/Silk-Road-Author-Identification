				Can we all come to a conclusion as to what can be bought and sold at Silk Road? Because really the only thing that administration warns us is to not have anything to do with child porn or murder hits, but anything else is free game.

				Well, some products don&#039;t need to be brought up as they should be obvious enough I hope. For instance, I&#039;m pretty sure it were to be looked down on if I were to be wanking it into gel-caps for ladies to buy and shove up their vaginas so they can give birth to beautiful little brats.&nbsp; ::)

				ok fair enough, well there is a section for that sort of thing, and as far as i&#039;m aware no one has kicked off about selling pirated software, which i suppose is akin to &#039;hacking services&#039;. people only kicked up a fuss about guns, and SR sorted that out by creating another market.<br /><br />sorry, the &#039;retarded&#039; comment bugged me - been chemical free for a few days now and i&#039;m starting to get a bit ratty with it

				I think offering a service like &quot;Hacker Services&quot; would be a nice addition. From services like hacking our smartphone, to hacking someones email. They would all or mostly be custom hacking scripts people would have to write, but there is money to be made here.<br /><br />
