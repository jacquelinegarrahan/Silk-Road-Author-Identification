				Just wondering what people have come across on the clearnet whether it be steroids, coke, weed etc (anything but RC&#039;s)..&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a site supposedly selling sheets of acid before (No I didn&#039;t make a purchase).&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve used several M.O.M services through out the years. I&#039;ve used one since 2004 till recently...<br /><br />Also used a few RC vendors but nothing recently. Never had any problem with any of them.

				We found home printed business cards in 2 of our NYC clubs for this site: goo.gl/I2CM0<br />Thought it was interesting... placed an order. We received some pretty high quality MDMA - Mecke &amp; Marquis both great results... I&#039;m sure there are more sites like that out there.<br />.Hades.

				Indeed. Apparently whoever runs it goes into clubs and tapes little card holders to the bathroom walls with a link to the site. Pretty effective given the people at the club are likely your target audience. Ballsy.. but we figured we&#039;d have to give it a try. :D<br />.Hades.

				I didn&#039;t even know that it was possible to buy illegal drugs on the Internet before I heard about Silk Road let alone such a large variety. And yeah I would twice before buying any illegal drugs off the Internet without TOR, Bitcoins, and PGP.&nbsp;

When you click through beyond the first page you have to enter pretty much the same information you give when buying on SR - name, address, and email. Then a little while later they send you information for the bank deposit... it appears they use bitinstant and just forward you the information.<br />.Hades.
