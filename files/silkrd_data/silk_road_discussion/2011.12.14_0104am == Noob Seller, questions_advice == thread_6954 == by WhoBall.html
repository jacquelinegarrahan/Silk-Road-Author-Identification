				Howdy all, just a couple noob questions.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t flame me for not looking through forum, I have been, but it is extremely slow due to TOR network.&nbsp; Plus, I&#039;m using random wifi networks I found wardriving, adding to the slowness, and putting me on a time limit for browsing forum due to the fact I&#039;m parked in front of strangers houses with strange antennas on the roof of my ride =).&nbsp; &nbsp;I live in the U.S. and am much more interested in Selling than buying.&nbsp; Curious as what would be the best way to get bit coins earned from sales into cash money without alerting LE to where loot is heading or how loot was generated.&nbsp; Any site suggestions would be awesome.&nbsp; Not really an advanced computer guy, but hoping I can do this in a secure untraceable way.&nbsp; Does anyone know of anyone that uses Silk Road as a seller, living in the U.S. that has been caught?&nbsp; If I made sure and take all the precautions I have found on site, what are the chances of me getting caught?&nbsp; I see they say u should use USPS, this means I could drop mail packages off anonymously in post box correct?&nbsp; I may want to use bigger boxes so I can put a valid legal item in them, and stash actual stuff I am selling inside legitimate item, which would mean that I would probably have to walk into post office sense I would be mailing a box, and wouldn&#039;t be able to just drop in a mailbox.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is that a good idea?&nbsp; I know questions are kinda vague, I&#039;m just looking for tips/advice that will get me looking in right direction and up and running in the right way.&nbsp; Are there any good tutorials for obtaining bit coins anonymously, or tutorials for turning bit coins to cash and getting hands on cash without being traced.&nbsp; Any tutorials on the things I hit on in my post, or any kind tutorials/advice/suggestions/ that would be helpful to a person trying to sell on this site would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you for your time guys.
