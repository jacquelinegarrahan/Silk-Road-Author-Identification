				Stealth mode seems like a great idea at first in giving vendors more flexibility in controlling their exposure. But its flawed because&nbsp; a lot of important information that is normally available to the buyer disappears from view when its activated. Recent Feed backs for example. Whats stopping a long established, very trusted vendor from activating Stealth, then requesting FE? Buyers wouldn&#039;t be able to see the big increase of FE requests left in the feedback pages.<br /><br />Even the best of the best will go bad if their situation forces them to; or they succumb to greed. It seems like the pattern of a few of the biggest scammers on SR are to establish a large and trusting client base then take them for every coin they have. Perhaps SR could implement some sort of Finalize Early value on the Vendor page, that shows a vendor&#039;s percentage of FE orders over a given period of time / number of orders. <br /><br />I mean at the moment, if a good a Vendor goes rogue and Activates stealth, customers will have no idea what&#039;s up. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;The argument is that a vendor may choose to deal selectively with proven return customers, pretty much making the feed backs irrelevant. For example - you&#039;ve bought 50 orders from Vendor X. He delivers on time, great customer service.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Additional to the OP, if a vendor has built up a good enough customer base of people he&#039;s done business with fairly regularly/with good success, there is really no reason for them to use the stealth mode over simply taking their transactions off site and therefore bypassing the SR fee&#039;s etc.&nbsp; I do think that the concept is good, but the execution needs to be refined.&nbsp;
