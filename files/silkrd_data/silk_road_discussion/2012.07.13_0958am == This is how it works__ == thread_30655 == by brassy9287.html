				Hello brassy9287,<br /><br />you can also go to &quot;settings&quot; and change the currency so it display prices in Dollars. <br />If you spend some more time here you will notice that most products are sold for a higher price than sold on the street, but you will also find some great deals for products of high quality that are very much worth the extra dollars or simply have access to products that aren&#039;t available near you. So that are the ups and downs of the road.<br /><br />Hope you will find a better dmt deal ;)

				I&#039;m noticing that while the B&#039;s go up and up and up, the ORIGINAL set price of products set by vendors stay the same and are then based on the 8 dollar Btc&#039;s instead of maybe 6 dollar btc that was the case when item was first listed.<br /><br />Am I incorrect here? Missing something? I&#039;m getting the impression that while btc skyrockets, products are all much much higher without any change.

				If you are looking for DMT I would wait for moon unit to come back. I&#039;ve never ordered from him myself but he&#039;s trusted and his prices undercut ever other DMT vendor by a ridiculous amount last time I checked
