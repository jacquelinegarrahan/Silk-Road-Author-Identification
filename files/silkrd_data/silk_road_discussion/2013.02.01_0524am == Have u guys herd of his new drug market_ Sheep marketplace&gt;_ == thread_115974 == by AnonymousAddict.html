				I think competition is healthy esp. at this time but who ever came up with this marketplace went about it in the exact opposite way to do it. <br />The url and name of the site in general is demeaning to the vendors and members.<br />It automatically uses a point of looking&nbsp; down on the vendors and members in a negative light and for that reason alone I never looked at the site.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				To say that automatically the name of the marketplace has one and only one interpretation, and that it&#039;s automatically a bad place just because you can interpret its name in a particular way because of the connotations of the use of the term &quot;sheep&quot; particularly in political contexts is a pretty thin argument.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone engaging in this sort of market has reason for healthy skepticism, but I recall back when forums were dropping left and right, and so many were avoiding the silk road because of the same kind of talk:&nbsp; that it MUST be a honeypot, that it MUST be fatally flawed in security, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are a ton of knee jerk reactions that I advise you avoid, but I am not saying you should jump in the water with sharks either.&nbsp; The important thing to keep in mind, is if any of these dangers have any merit then they must have a mechanism.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So the question is, is this site trying to execute javascript?<br />Is it trying to get people to engage with a less secure medium?<br />Is it fishing for passwords or pins?&nbsp; <br /><br />So far we don&#039;t have any reason to believe these things are true, but it would be wise to exercise caution.&nbsp; Make sure your not running javascript, make sure your not installing ActiveX or other extensions that compromise security,&nbsp; &nbsp;Certain files like PDF&#039;s can run exploits on the machine you download and run them on.&nbsp; The farmers market went down not because of the security of tor, but because people decided to do a ton of completely insecure transactions using wire services and paypal, and weak email security.. so it had nothing to do with tor.&nbsp; &nbsp;I take this as a good sign that government is at least being forced to attack indirectly rather than truly taking on Tor itself. <br /><br />aside from all that, <br /><br />Having multiple tor market places out there is probably a good idea.&nbsp; I&#039;ve programmed much of the same myself, but part of what makes it worth diversifying the market is not only the distributed power that if one goes down there will be another, but that one site can fork on the concept and attempt to improve it.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t much of an improvement on <br />the concept of the site in this regard, which doesn&#039;t inspire me much, as when I start thinking about how to go about on improving the silk road model, I literally cannot imagine building all the possible variations on improvements.&nbsp; They claim that they have &quot;improved the security concerns&quot; regarding silk road, but they don&#039;t really comment much on exactly what that is, and exactly how they imagine they can telepathically know silk roads code that they don&#039;t have access to.&nbsp; <br /><br />If your going to branch off from silk road with a new site I suggest this:<br /><br />implement further anarcho-capitalistic methods for dispute resolution.. <br />create better contractual models for sales, you can&#039;t resolve conflicts that are based on vague terms. <br />stop using the old forum model when you can create entirely new systems for dealing with the reporting problem. <br /><br />I could go on and on, but I plan on telling you the rest in my own way.&nbsp; It&#039;s clear to me that the model must be evolved.<br />

				OK so out of curiosity i signed up... no i did use my SR details!<br /><br />In order to become a vendor you must deposit 10btc into your account and click activate... at which point those 10btc will leave your account and you will become a vendor. For a customer account you will need to deposit 1btc and click activate... except this time the 1btc will not leave your account.<br /><br />Having browsed around to get a feel for the site it is aesthetically pleasing with some nice features.<br />You can view prices in ฿, $, £ and €<br />Not a huge selection currently but im sure that will change over time.<br />The only think that bugs me is that there are many spelling errors eg in the drugs category you have things like &quot;Ectasy&quot;, &quot;Canabis&quot; not to mention the &quot;Profil&quot; Page<br />Spelling mistakes as such are often done purposely in &quot;im from Nigeria and want to send you a million dollars&quot; type scams<br />I have noticed some SR Vendors are on there (may not actually be them so this needs to be confirmed)<br />I&#039;ll be keeping an eye on it<br /><br />Would anyone like some screenshots?

				Whoever stated there was only 6 drugs must of registered, Oh dear. Looks like somebody has been tracked and logged. The name is a pisstake though, surely L/E wouldn&#039;t try such a blatantly obvious trap<br />and&nbsp; then&nbsp; ruin the work by naming it as such. Unless they are using the most devious reverse psychology. Who ever it is( disgruntled ex roader ?) They are having a giraffe ( laugh).

				Guys I&#039;ve created a customer account to check what it looked like. To me, it looks like a copycat of SilkRoad. I mean, the whole design is just the same with small visual tweaks and color changes. There are about a dozen of listings, mostly weed right now. It has a review system, a vendor rating system (i.e. T5(100)). I must say though, the website is beautiful and pleasing to the eye. Seems like vendors can rate buyers as well to warn other vendors from shit customers. <br /><br />No idea if there is an escrow system but I would think so?? Will wait a bit to see how it goes and how legit it is, but a bit of competition cannot hurt!

				I registered.&nbsp; I tried it out it&#039;s actually quite nice.<br />One vendor on there is from silk Road.&nbsp; He&#039;s legit.&nbsp; <br /><br />My guess is the site is from a foreign country like India.<br />It&#039;s got a few tweaks to go yet,&nbsp; But it&#039;s almost there.<br /><br />I&#039;m willing to give it a try this week and post here how it went.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try the hash oil.&nbsp; Small order.<br />It has an escrow system and Everything else looks pretty good.<br /><br />I think Having a second marketplace is handy.&nbsp; Especially when silk Road goes down for a while.&nbsp; &nbsp;People still need their meds.<br /><br />Long-live silk Road.&nbsp; Of course nothing will beat the original.

				You see guys,&nbsp; The more sites like this the better.&nbsp; It makes it that much harder for law enforcement to crack down on them.&nbsp; It makes it that much more expensive to crack down on them.<br /><br />Just look at MP3s.&nbsp; &nbsp;First was Napster.&nbsp; Then it went out of control and nobody could do anything to control it.&nbsp; &nbsp;There were thousands of sites just like Napster popping up everywhere.<br /><br />That&#039;s with this concept needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think that&#039;s what&#039;s implied by the name sheep .&nbsp; That there is safety in numbers. <br />

If they can get in(let alone crash it), then it isn&#039;t worth our time. If they can&#039;t and this shit actually looks legit, I&#039;d consider registering

				I signed up and even managed to put up a listing eventually, the line of text telling me my pic was too big was too inconspicuous for me to notice :)<br />I don&#039;t know if i&#039;ll ever go back again though, i couldn&#039;t bookmark the site and its address isn&#039;t very memorable :)

				I was messaged by them letting me know about the website and I did go ahead and ask how come they picked sheep as a logo. I was told that originally the idea behind the logo was &quot;Black Sheep.&quot;&nbsp; When i visited I had to go war driving to sign up, but could someone verify that this site doesn&#039;t use any client side scripting like javascipt, it would be nice if we could verify that they aren&#039;t running scripts pulling ip address&#039;s. <br /><br />I would like to add that I think the bad English is bc the person that made the site is german, English is not their first language but I agree that it should be fixed, as it shows carelessness.<br /><br />
