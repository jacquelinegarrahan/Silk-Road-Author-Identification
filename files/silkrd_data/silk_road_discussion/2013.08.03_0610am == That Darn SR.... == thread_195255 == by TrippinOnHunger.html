				I go through phases of buying a lot of stuff on here and when I do, boy do I become ADDICTED!&nbsp; &nbsp;I tell myself, ok sign in, check your messages, log out, then do what you gotta do!&nbsp; Yea well, what happens is.. I sign in and BAM something on the home page has caught my eyes! or I check my messages and start looking at vendors profiles and I easily drown.&nbsp; Usually I accidentally end up on SR and the forums for a minimum of 2 hours.. and these are the times that I have shit to do later on. <br /><br />So what Im trying to say is... Damn it SR you taking up all my time and thats not cool!<br /><br />SAID NO ONE EVER!&nbsp; Thank you to everyone who made these websites possible!&nbsp; =)<br /><br />Does anyone else feel this way too?&nbsp; I obviously cant be the only one!

				A wise man (some random SRF user whose anonymous nickname I don&#039;t even remember) once said something along the lines of &quot;If I&#039;ve learned anything from SR, it&#039;s that there&#039;s always somebody in the same situation as you.&quot; <br /><br />So I can assure you that you&#039;re not alone. I&#039;m in more or less the same boat, my friend.

				That&#039;s the great thing about a community of this size. No matter what your situation is, someone else is going through the same thing. Just found this place and don&#039;t know what to do? There are others. Having a life changing psychedelic experience? There are others. Experiencing severe withdrawals? There are others. Just got raided? There are others. We can celebrate and commiserate together, because no matter what happens, somebody knows exactly what you&#039;re going through.<br />
