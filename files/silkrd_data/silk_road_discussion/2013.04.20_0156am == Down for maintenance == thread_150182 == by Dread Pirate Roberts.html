				Damn, just as I went to log on to see if I had any messages! Oh well, as usual -- thanks DPR for the updates, they are appreciated. :)<br /><br />However, can anyone please tell me the significance of the PGP signature? I understand it&#039;s a verification thing, but as someone who is still new to using it (I may or may not use it on an affiliated site), how does it prove that it is DPR? Do you use the PGP Key to reproduce the text/message? Sorry, I know this has probably been answered a million, perhaps billion times but I thought I&#039;d ask for myself :)

				i have 100% confidence in the dread pirate and his/her staff. the problem with problems involvded with cloak and dagger games such as SR is that when you are being hunted and hounded many times the finks I mean feds will create pro lems just as a ploy and then creat fake reasins those fake problens happend for so its a constant game of looking for ghost. i pray that the dreaded one and staff can always have the cloaking device engaged and one step abewd of the finks..i mean feds. gods speed to you DPR.

Especially here in the US, where the dictator in chief signed your rights away on New Years Eve 2011. <br /><br />Bet you didn&#039;t know that?&nbsp; Under the 2012 NDAA’s Sec. 1021, Pres. Obama agreed to give the military the power to arrest and hold Americans without the writ of habeas corpus. <br /><br />You should be more worried about that, than a temporary downtime for maintenance. <br /><br />Go take some drugs, if you actually buy on here. Or go have a drink. Read a book. Each day this site is up and working is a miracle. <br /><br />A lot of you mainly younger people, say 24 and under (estimate) are becoming known as Generation &#039;V&#039; for vanity. Your expectations that the lights should never go out, and if you can&#039;t get a cell tower, it&#039;s a major crisis, really speaks to an unrealistic view of the world, and a huge narcissism issue. <br /><br />

				As soon as I saw it was in the Newbie section I was thinking it was odd. On top of all the smart people who were saying tracing the IP is almost impossible through TOR.<br /><br />Plus why would the DEA waste their timing messaging people through a fucking forum when they have a better chance of catching the person by monitoring their mail for more solid evidence to get them fucked.&nbsp; Even so, they want the sellers not us.

Silk Road is a huge step up from any other drug site that has been online before and finally allows drug users the freedom of safely buying a wide range of high quality drugs. Hopefully one day, we will see drugs become decriminalised or legalised. We can only hope! Too many people have been punished for a victimless crime and it&#039;s about time it stopped!

I&#039;m just going on for the 1st time in 12 hours, and it&#039;s taken me 10 minutes to load a SR page, after hitting &#039;reload&#039; 5 times. <br />These bottlenecks sometimes follow an outage. Add to that it&#039;s a Saturday, also many exchanges are closed, so it&#039;s just the machines doing the work, with maybe a skeleton crew on duty to keep an eye on the servers. This will all iron out. If not by Sunday, definitely by Monday.<br /><br />I used to work in a telecom environment, and when a glitch happened on a Friday night, there was only so much you could do on a weekend to keep things humming along.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />This too shall pass

				has anyone thought that MAYBE the slow speed is BECAUSE of the holiday + 420 sale + the fact that there was downtime?<br /><br />People wanna capitalize on the discounts.<br />Vendors want to process the multitude of orders.<br />Holiday = people do not have to work=more time to spend at a computer.<br /><br />I estimate, roughly, conservatively and based on nothing but gut feeling, at least 2 - 3 times the normal volume of traffic.<br /><br />Take into account that its tor.<br /><br /><br />
