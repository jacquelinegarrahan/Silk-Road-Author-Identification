				Hi everybody. Iv been reading the shite in this forum for the last 2 hours. Some people believe the site has been compramised. Others believe its just down to congestion. If anybody has actually logged into SR in the last 30-60 minutes or is logged on now please tell me now and put my mind at rest so I at least know its down to too much traffic.<br /><br />Thanks

				I can get to the login screen but there I see the capha is just 3 numbers rather than the usual 2 blocks of letter/number. <br />Have you guys got the same thing?<br />If so it may be an issue with the captcha not showing the correct display &amp; just showing the numbers but not the letters. Thats what I&#039;m thinking anyway.<br /><br />Are you getting any login failure messages?<br /><br />Haven&#039;t tried to get beyond the login yet.

				Everyone, grab the pipe next to you. Take hit. Chill out. Relax. These updates happen multiple times throughout the year. It is most likely just a last minute burp. I logged in a few hours ago, made some purchases, and logged out. I can&#039;t log in now, but there&#039;s no reason to fear....yet. Updates come as soon as they know what&#039;s up. It takes some time....I know that&#039;s tough in today&#039;s point and click, instant gratification society, but that&#039;s what you gotta do. I been on the road almost a year, and this is a common occurrence. It&#039;s needed to keep the site from being compromised. It&#039;s not happening because it is compromised. Stay in escrow, use pgp, and don&#039;t worry about compromise. If it does fail, and oyu lose $$, isn&#039;t that better than losing your freedom? <br />Peace

				This is fucking bullshit.. All good vendors should boycott SR and do business via email and fuck DPR&#039;s commission!!! Some vendors already do this and I only work with less than 5 and I trust them all :) Have like 1400 in escrow and placed a new order last night as it was working perfectly, and now he won&#039;t even be able to log on and see it today!!! Fuck this shit.. I&#039;m asking all my vendors to do shit commission free and escrow free after this shit... makes them more money and no stupid conspiracy bullshit and just this fucking shit period!!! I want my fucking order sent today or DPR can suck a dick... and yes this is shady with no update.... He just fixed it people so what&#039;s going on??

				I think doing business without escrow is not really a good idea. May be it works a time but some day if a vendor stops his business he will scam you. Nearly everyone would do that if you give him money and he can go away with it and never will see you again.

				I just connected to the login page, and I&#039;m trying to get through but I keep getting the &quot;taking too long to respond&quot; message. The captcha for the login page was kinda fucked, it just said &quot;950&quot;. Whatever, I&#039;m hoping this is just a system hiccup.

				I managed to login not long ago but was unable to do anything on the site.<br />I have another account on SR which I don&#039;t use except for times like this when I am not willing to enter my real username/password to the site incase the servers leak any data, which can happen when traffic volumes like this start submitting so many querys to the DB&#039;s.<br />I personally havn&#039;t been worried in the slightest and i&#039;m almost certain the problems we are seeing know is purely from huge site traffic.<br />I for one won&#039;t be attempting to login again until tomorrow to give the servers a chance to stabalize.<br />&nbsp;
