				hi hi<br /><br />all very good tweaks that go in the right direction....<br /><br />any thoughts on the minority of reviews (1-4) being omnipresent on all pages of 5/5 feedback? any vendor with at least 1 review at any rating from 1-4 will have that paragraph on every page when a viewer pages through the 5/5 feedback... perhaps keep all of the &quot;pages&quot; in sync?<br /><br /><br />also, i have noticed for reviews written in the &quot;new&quot; system you&#039;ve included back in the header the exact dollar amounts of the orders. why? i was very pleased that you saw the practicality of not clearly broadcasting exact dollar amounts for everything to the world... there were quite a few security concerns that were brought up in the other threads and i&#039;m wondering what makes new reviews fall under different rules.<br /><br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb

				This is what I&#039;m talking about. I&#039;ve slowly started to somewhat accept locked in feedback but still feel there should be maybe a week to edit it but I understand the argument against it so maybe, as many have already suggested, only being able to increase the rating.

				I for one think the new system is fairer to all and a good step forward - I was somewhat dubious when the individual ratings on an item&#039;s page went awol but I&#039;m really encouraged by the speed of the tweaks to get a happy middle ground for all. <br /><br />For future updates would it be possible to start &#039;DRP&#039;s beta club&#039; where open minded buyers and sellers could &#039;opt-in&#039; to proposed changes in a beta environment to gather feedback prior to the whole community getting the changes - it wouldn&#039;t need to be a live site with proper listings. I&#039;m sure there are enough community members that would spare an hour or two to test out changes. . <br /><br />Anyway, thanks to DRP and their team - progress isn&#039;t welcomed by all and it takes balls to change something that people feel passionate about - so kudos. <br /><br />Take care all, (and NEVER FE ;)<br /><br />Erl. <br /><br />**edited a typo**

				DPR, <br /><br />Looking good boss. Excellent work that&#039;s only getting better. Thanks for taking into consideration the thoughts of vendors and buyers alike. Yes, it will be an SR cultural change - a paradigm shift. But we can adapt. Making feedback permanent was the right choice given that nearly every e-commerce site on the web makes ratings and feedback permanent once left. And adding the ability for a buyer to delete a review was also a wise choice. <br /><br />Libertarianism is also about taking responsibility for one&#039;s own self. These new changes are more in line with these Libertarian values. <br /><br />As time goes on and people find ways to exploit whatever deficiencies exist, everyone should be confident that you will address them for the betterment of SR that makes for a happy median. <br /><br />Congratulations, you&#039;ve done excellent work here. I was somewhat of a harsh critic at first until I saw the bigger picture and realized that taken as a whole, it all amounts to a better and more robust Silk Road. <br /><br />:)

				Dpr you gotta remove this stats hidden option man. I know people don&#039;t like it, but all the concerns are ridicules.<br /><br />You MUST think of the greater good. A true market where anonymous fake reviews can not be used to catapult someone to the top spot. If you must, keep the username hidden, but display vendors used, and range of amount.

But consider the effect of confirmation bias: a buyer with a good impression initially will probably just look at 5/5 reviews and ignore the rest. Conversely, a skeptical buyer will just read about the problems and move on to another vendor that doesn&#039;t have any 1/5 reviews (which ironically is probably a vendor that is simply too new to have gotten them yet).<br /><br />In order to get a full picture of a vendor, you need to check the stats at the top of the page, then switch to recent reviews to check for recent scam activity, then view a few pages of 5/5 reviews, then back out and start in on the 4/5 reviews while noting the dates, then back out and so on. It&#039;s not that it can&#039;t be done, but that it can&#039;t be done quickly or easily.<br /><br />I know you&#039;ve put a lot of time and energy into these updates and I&#039;m extraordinarily pleased to see an effort to improve the experience. I&#039;m just afraid that things are becoming much more complicated than they need to be for such a simple task: checking feedback. Like the first few generations of BMW&#039;s iDrive system that required several clicks and spins of the wheel to simply adjust the radio station or temperature, the feedback system risks becoming a counter intuitive monstrosity that could create a swarm of confused n00bs and a mountain of pending support tickets.<br /><br />Might I offer a very simple solution that could be implemented tomorrow if you decided to go with it? Just give us a long list of feedback ratings and reviews, sorted chronologically (with the option of switching to weighted order) of around 20 or so per page, with a simple product descriptor atop each review. This way a customer can scan the most recent (or most heavily weighted) 60 reviews with 3 clicks total. One to get to the review page, and one to turn each page. That&#039;s a lot of info to digest very quickly with no back and forth or extra attention paid to dates, or the risk of other biases. Just the straight dope, so to speak.<br /><br />I know you&#039;ve been working hard. Keep it up.<br /><br />Endemic

				hi hi<br /><br />endemic: you are absolutely correct in your interpretation of my comment regarding the &quot;pages of 5/5 vs pages of 1-4/5&quot;&nbsp; thank you for helping me explain my thoughts :)<br /><br />my clumsy solution is/was to synchronize the pages for all x/5 reviews. so in your example of 1000 orders, if the front page were 5 posts long, you would see 25 reviews on the first page, 5 of each rating, and then when clicking page 2, you&#039;d see ONLY 5/5s as the other x/5 ratings were already viewed on the first page.... page 3 would be more only 5/5s all the way until the final page of 5/5s... make sense?&nbsp; this way the casual buyer is not seeing the same scammer bs page after page and not realizing they&#039;re in fact the same reviews from months ago re-loading over and over..<br /><br /><br />shroomin1: in addition to security, price experimentation is also one of the main reasons for not advertising the exact dollar amount per sale. glad you agree! there&#039;s MANY reasons to keep that information hidden, or at the very least vague. this has all been brought up already in the other threads. i still do not understand why DPR insists it&#039;s &quot;less visible&quot; when ANY dollar amount is clearly more visible than NO dollar amount....&nbsp; why not generalize it in brackets of 10, 25, 50, or 100 dollar increments? if buyer stats can be generalized i see no reason why vendor sale amounts are exact dollars.&nbsp; DPR agreed with the overwhelming sentiment that those numbers should be hidden for pre-tweak reviews; i see no logical explanation for different rules on post-tweak reviews.<br /><br />allowing a buyer to remove feedback is nice, but i dont really see many people doing this.&nbsp; it seems to be an issue just to get them to write a review now. i&#039;m happy i&#039;m at least still getting star ratings lol<br /><br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb

i was very pleased that you saw the practicality of not clearly broadcasting exact dollar amounts for everything to the world... there were quite a few security concerns that were brought up in the other threads and i&#039;m wondering what makes new reviews fall under different rules.<br /><br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The review groups are already sorted with 5&#039;s at the top.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s fine as it is.<br /><br />the exact dollar amount and quantity is only listed for new reviews.&nbsp; This is not new info because anyone scraping the site before could get this info as reviews rolled in.&nbsp; Now everyone has it.&nbsp; Additionally, because only transactions that have a review written for them are displayed, you can&#039;t get a complete picture of a vendor&#039;s business like you used to.&nbsp; In my opinion, that alone makes all of the headache of this change worth it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />hi hi<br /><br />i&#039;m sorry i must not have explained what i meant properly.&nbsp; if a vendor has many pages of 5/5 and only a single 1, 2, 3, or 4 rating... each time a viewer clicks &quot;next page&quot; on the 5/5 section, the other lower rating reviews are still present on all subsequent 5/5 pages.&nbsp; to the casual observer, it would appear that there are multiple pages of those lesser reviews as well, when in fact it&#039;s same one reloading on each new page...<br /><br />that&#039;s all i meant. <br /><br /><br />as for the exact dollar amount, i understand scripts can scrape the site and get that information, but it&#039;s not exactly clearly visible to the human observer. appears to take someone to be initiated enough to do such a thing, not stumbling upon something &quot;interesting&quot;<br /><br />would you be adverse to &quot;generalizing&quot; it similar to how the buyer stats are generalized on the reviews?<br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />And to piggyback onto this, like Endemic expresses it so well, a vendor who has done a large volume would be at a huge disadvantage especially since they tend to become &quot;larger targets&quot; &amp; will by nature have more negative feed back if they have been around for a while.&nbsp; So they may have 10 or 15 feedbacks that are less than 5/5,&nbsp; but with the 5000 5/5&#039;s that were given in the same time frame it doesn&#039;t give a customer a real look at the landscape . . .&nbsp; they see 5 good feedbacks at a time, but the same negative ones each time they refresh the page for the next page of good feedbacks.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is why the (100) was so important, it gave the customers an immediate pic of what was REALLY going on!&nbsp; And on top of that eveyone who was giving vendor 5/5 for doing a good job will now be knocking them down to 4/5 for the same service which makes SR vendors look like more barely average like Atlantis.&nbsp; I thought you were trying to blow Atlantis out of the water, not trying to make it more appealing!<br /><br />There should be another option to see the feedback in chroniclogical order with the good with the bad so both buyer &amp; vendor can see immediately what is happening in realtime so no one has to try to figure out what the less than perfect feedback has to do with the last 20 or even 100 orders.<br /><br />There is still an issue for us to follow what is going on with the latest feedback still.&nbsp; Ours starts out by showing it from 3 days ago, (wtf)&nbsp; &amp; if we check out recent orders it only shows the last 10 orders that go back 22 hours on all the pages so with no feedback so there is no way for us to find out wtf is going on to fix anything if we need to.<br />NCK

Just give us a long list of feedback ratings and reviews, sorted chronologically (with the option of switching to weighted order) of around 20 or so per page, with a simple product descriptor atop each review. This way a customer can scan the most recent (or most heavily weighted) 60 reviews with 3 clicks total. One to get to the review page, and one to turn each page. That&#039;s a lot of info to digest very quickly with no back and forth or extra attention paid to dates, or the risk of other biases.

				I think dpr is on the right track with this. There is one problem that is affecting alot of vendors its that buyers dont really have any real incentive to leave feedback. So instead of just leaving links posted around for them to do that why not just force them to? Like if they go to buy something after finalizing a sale then a page should pop up, &quot;if you would like to make another purchase please finish rating your vendors&quot;.

				I suggest that buyers only be allowed to edit their most recent feedback with a vendor. This would prevent a buyer with multiple recent buys using them to blackmail, while still retaining the usefulness of feedback.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People are talking as if the bribe/ blackmail can happen with a single instance of feedback. If that&#039;s the case it can happen whatever the setup. A buyer can message a vendor he just purchased from and say &quot;I am not happy with product/did not arrive I want full refund or 1/5&quot; (I assume this is how the blackmail works not &quot;give me money for blackmail or 1/5 LOL&quot;).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If it is possible for a well weighted buyer to fuck a vendor with one feedback the weighting needs adjusting…<br /><br />If this is the case I predict buyers with good stats being asked to FALAFE: finalise and leave a five early!

				1) being able to sort reviews by 5-1..being able to see all of a certain number, chronological-as well as reverse, as well as by items.<br /><br />2) there should be a limited amount of time that you are able to edit feedback. perfect if you fe before weighing or testing but not long enough for extortion. say 2-4 days?

				ΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞ<br />I hope SR staffs can read this.<br />ΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞ<br /><br />Since the reviews and rating system got overhauled, I have received quite a number of ratings lesser than 5 in a week and it has never happened before. I have found out that my customers were actually happy with the product, but they thought leaving a 4/5 is just as fine as 5/5, because a 4/5 read &quot;Solid, would recommend&quot;. This is actually not quite fair to we vendors, because &quot;Solid, would recommend&quot; sounds just like a 5/5, and before SR came out with the new system, the majority of my customers used to say something like this with a 5/5. (Since someone is gonna recommend you to his mates, why should the rating of we vendors get pulled down by a &quot;Solid, would recommend&quot;?)<br /><br />Also, not allowing feedback to be edited or changed is just as bad. I am confident to say that most of my customers do not even know about that, so even if I am willing to resolve any issues of theirs, they can&#039;t change their feedback anymore back to 5/5. So no point to &quot;rescue&quot; any issues then, no point to refund if something goes wrong with the post, is that what the system wants/encourages? The new system will only cause more and more buyers get blacklisted by their vendor (I have blacklisted 3 buyers in just 3 days) and create misunderstandings, while in fact, both vendor and buyer are innocent and are very happy with the overall transaction.<br /><br />This is just my humble opinion, I am a small vendor on SR but I think I have paid enough of commissions to at least voice my opinions out.<br /><br />Sorry for my bad grammar, not native speaker.

				Altering feedback seems to be a charged topic, but something that nobody has brought up (and if they did I apologize) is the possibility of &quot;updated feedback&quot; - giving buyers the option of one, threaded, followup comment to their reviews - e.g. &quot;Finally got around to trying this and it was awesome.&quot;&nbsp; That way the original feedback stays intact and a buyer who raved cannot then flip it on the vendor without justifying the reason for their reversal.&nbsp; Just&nbsp; a thought.

				Here is what is bugging me about the rating and review system...<br /><br />When a customer leaves a less that 5/5 ranking to start with, then goes back and changes it, the system still keeps it as less than 5/5 and it still counts against your vendor percentage<br /><br />I only have 3 review that are less than perfect, and 2 of them were changed because at first the customer made a mistake, but they still show up as less than perfect...wtf?

				From all the criticism on the forum...I thought this would be a horrific change.<br /><br />I actually quite like it. People are encouraged to actually leave more substance in their reviews. Unlike the previous system...I can see how the vendor is for all of their products which lets me know more about the stuff that matters...like stealth, time to deliver, and resolution management.&nbsp; <br /><br />The scores are accurate. In the real world..a B is above average..it means that you are solid..but not amazing. 5/5s were being abused. Im amazed with my vendor for speed..quality...and price..but there are a few that I&#039;ve ordered from that id only rate a 4/5 because of something offputting. its good that now we&#039;re encouraged to do so.

				Couple quick design suggestion:<br /><br />1. Increase the prominence of the rating score in each feedback message.<br /><br />Right now, it currently shows in the top right &quot;5/5&quot; right next to the date which is a little difficult to notice. Since this is the most important characteristic of a feedback message, it should be made more visible. This would especially help when looking at a long list of feedback with many different scores.<br /><br />Personally, I would color the score in shades from green to red. Or in other words, communicate the vendors score using some color. Seeing lots of red means to stay clear. Lots of green means its safe to order.<br /><br />2. Another issue with the feedback messages is that the writing &quot;alias hidden&quot; and &quot;stats: (hidden)&quot; is basically useless information for most users and is even somewhat confusing. If there is no relevant information to put there, why not just remove that space for those messages? This will make seeing those messages with buyer stats that much more special.<br />

				DPR, your desire to upgrade SR and your efforts to that end are very commendable but sadly, they are doing a lot of harm and many, many vendors&#039; businesses are suffering.<br />I know you were probably unable to run an even partially normal dev cycle but rolling the new system out completely, as you did, and fixing the problems on the fly, is exactly the opposite of what any respectable developer or product manager would advise you to do. (and if your people are telling you this is how a good Agile cycle is supposed to run, you need to kick that person in the teeth)<br />In fact, you are making most of the mistakes that have been well documented in cases like Microsoft Vista, Windows 8 and several massive Facebook software changes that ended up rolled back days or weeks after getting rolled out.<br />Please roll back to the old system, take the new one back into a dev environment, have your developer(s) study all of the feedback and newly-acquired information, and have him/them work to implement those changes offline. <br />When it&#039;s time, do a controlled beta - maybe ask for volunteers or incentivize vendors to participate in the beta with a deal like, no SR commission for a period of time...something...but doing it the way your doing it now is hurting a lot of vendors, myself included, and it doesn&#039;t have to be this way.<br />I&#039;ve worked through these kinds of upgrade fails many times during an earlier iteration in my professional life and I can say absolutely (and so can the plethora of case studies on this issue) that you gain more by rolling back to the previous version, and fixing the problems slowly and carefully offline, then you do by ploughing forward and ignoring the massive collateral damage that&#039;s being done to vendors&#039; businesses across the community. <br />And by rolling back, you will increase vendor faith and confidence in you because you will have demonstrated that you take our concerns seriously, which is a commodity you cannot buy...<br />Please listen to us...and don&#039;t forget that we need each other for SR to work at it&#039;s best.<br />thx

				I see a lot of people still pretty negative on the new feedback system, even AlbertHoffman1943 who is one of my current favorite vendors around.&nbsp; I agree that overall the old system sort of worked better because it forced feedback immediately (this was ok because it allowed editing) and gave more realtime feedback about a vendor&#039;s current activities (the very nature of forcing feedback immediately).&nbsp; I think these are the main reasons people want to roll back to the old system.&nbsp; But there are certainly a lot of benefits to the new system that many have recognized, and from doing development of php web apps and databases on a smaller scale, I seriously doubt a full rollback is even in the cards at this stage.&nbsp; There are probably too many bug fixes, improvements, changes in data structures, etc, that it would cause havoc to try to go back now so I just seriously doubt DPR is considering this in the slightest, and I don&#039;t blame him.<br /><br />I do think however, that a very minor compromise in the way the new system works would make nearly everyone happy.&nbsp; Most of the current complaints, it seems, stem from the lack of realtime feedback available to prospective buyers, which reduces buyer confidence and makes choosing new vendors difficult.&nbsp; The only reason this capability has been lost is because feedback is no longer mandatory.&nbsp; The only reason feedback is no longer mandatory is because is it immutable.<br /><br />All we need is a minor allowance for editing feedback for a short period of time or for the last order from a vendor.&nbsp; These ideas have been mentioned by many in various threads.&nbsp; This would still prevent mass feedback blackmail, the impetus for the original change, and it would allow feedback to be mandatory again, because that&#039;s fine as long as it&#039;s briefly editable.&nbsp; The mandatory feedback would provide the kind of realtime updates to a vendor&#039;s sales that buyers need to evaluate vendors, and I think this would mitigate the problems still affecting some users/vendors that are causing a subset of them to still call for a full rollback.<br /><br />Several features of the new system are improvements, and it really would be better to make this simple change rather than to roll back.&nbsp; For instance, there are benefits to seeing the obfuscated buyer stats next to the feedback to help weight the reliability of the feedback.&nbsp; Of course, I think the site-wide aliases should go as I&#039;ve mentioned elsewhere, since that is the only real privacy issue left in the current system, but this is a relatively simple change, I think, without rolling anything back.<br /><br />Are there really any legitimate problems with the new system that would not be addressed by these two changes?&nbsp; &nbsp; to summarize:<br />- limited, temporary feedback editing to prevent blackmail but provide realtime sales data similiar to the old system<br />- removing user aliases to increase privacy but use another identifier (based on user/alias+vendor hash) to differentiate individual users on a specific vendor&#039;s feedback page (to prevent padding feedback)<br /><br />From everyone&#039;s comments wanting to go back to the old system, it seems like this would satisfy them and provide the best of the old and the new feedback systems.&nbsp; Am I wrong, anyone?<br /><br />Anyway, I hope some kind of compromise is reached soon that everyone will accept because this site is such a wonderful resource that DPR has gone out of his way to provide for us and I don&#039;t like seeing so much unnecessary strife surrounding some otherwise minor changes/improvements that seem to be causing some people major problems because of how they were implemented.

				I know I&#039;m hammering this point, but I really want DPR to see it. The new feedback is great, but its vital a buyer can edit last feedback with a vendor. The reason is so that it will be easy to see when a vendor is turning exit scam and asking lots of people to FE. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under current system a buyer who is asked to FE can either leave &#039;FE as requested&#039; or wait to see if item arrives and then leave feedback. Neither of these is helpful if vendor is asking everyone to FE as part of exit scam.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If a buyer could edit ONLY last feedback (thus removing risk of multi feedback blackmail) then he can put &quot;FE as requested&quot; then change it to show current status (item not arrived, vendor making promises but not following through) and since other customers in same situation will also be able to post similar updated feedbacks, a vendor pulling an exit scam will be exposed much more quickly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With this little tweak the new system will be much better. I&#039;m liking it apart from the no editing at all. I understand the reason this change was brought in but I think it has gone too far and destroyed a useful early warning system.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for your consideration, DPR. This site is becoming something really special and has changed my life in a modest way.

Make only most recent feedback on *that specific* vendor editable. If somebody makes another order from the same vendor, we can assume things went alright with the previous order so the feedback should not have to be changed.

The current inability to edit even the current feedback means a buyer who has FE has no way of indicating whether he received or not. Thus large scale exit FE scams become much harder to spot early on.

It is this slight tweak to the system I am pushing for, so that FE buyers can indicate to other customers whether they received or not., helping to alert early when an FE scammer is starting.

				The permanent rating thing is bullshit! I&#039;m getting way too many people sending me messages like this on an all to regular basis. <br /><br />&quot;man i totally fucked up... i went to leave a 5/5 and was on my phone, navigated away from the page, went back and clicked it and it was on dont leave a rating.... but i left you great feedback &gt;.&lt; next order will definitely be rated.. im such a tard.&quot;<br /><br />Lets get this improved, a vendors rating is the only thing we have to rely on to set us apart from other sellers.

				What is permanent feedback supposed to help with? Is there any good reason for it?<br /><br />Buyers can withhold ratings/feedback and delete them, so, I don&#039;t know of any good reason to make it permanent.<br />I do like the idea of only being able to change feedback on your most recent transaction (or transactions if they were within a few days of each other).<br />
