				Scams usually accompany these special holiday event &amp; sells and I&#039;m quite disappointed in the scammers not going batshit insane working up a frenzy to steal.

				@zombai spy lab - The only one that comes to mind is Tony. I was around for that, and felt the anger. I believe that is when FE get its rep around here. I personally have but would never again. I love a FE order, so we live and learn. I hope you have a fun 420 man, if you want, I will offer you some free bud cookies (Just 2, but that will take a afternoon lol). It sounds like you could use a good 420 favor :)<br /><br />I put my back into some well reviewed editables. Sales have been slow, but with reviews not coming in, I hope $6.50 top shelf bud cookies are considered a sale. I would not risk selling local and made way too many :D<br /><br />HAPPY 420, Dab, Rip, Toke, Smoke, Munch, Puff the day away roadies <br /><br />-F&amp;H<br />&nbsp;8)

				There was a post From Dread Pirate Roberts about this on the next page....<br /><br />But I have not seen many sales yet myself, <br />I hate working in sales but..<br />I did however send a cheeky message<br />to my usual dude, seeing if he is in the 420 spirit to do a nice top up deal<br />... Paid off very well :D
