				I notice a lot of vendors are asking their customers to give up any leverage they have before they are willing to ship the product. I can understand it if the customer has a low buyer feedback and some refunds but for people that are 100% or long time members, it doesn&#039;t make sense. <br /><br />I think making everyone finalize early defeats the entire purpose of escrow. I believe that escrow keeps the customer less stressed, and the dealer more in tune to the satisfaction of the customer. It drives the seller to get the product into the customers hands faster and the highest quality of product possible.<br /><br />If silk road would place FE as a rating that gives a score of 0 out of 5. Also charge another $100 for the privilege of asking your customers to FE, this should weed out the scammer vendors as it would cost $250 for them to even get started. Also place a mandatory suspension of seller account if their rating drops below a cretin percentage, this way they would limit FE orders to only new people and we get full escrow protection and customer service back. Or Silk Road could implement a MANDATORY 10 day escrow on and order finalized within X days of placing orders in transit. <br /><br />anonaddict

				$100 bucks is nothing to a scammer. One order will take care of that. Just go to someone else if a vendor requires FE. If everyone did that then no vendors would require it.

This is not the case, and some of the largest vendors on SR require it.<br /><br />However, I do praise you for remaining one of the accounts that do not require it, and we admire your dedication to your customers.<br /><br />As for the cost - scammers will always be here. Making it hard on them is also making it increasingly harder on the vendors as well, and most of these issues can be averted by buyers making more informed decisions.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t a website you can contact support or talk to the supervisor. If you are already here, then you should be smart enough to be able to research if a vendor is legitimate or not, regardless of their FE policy.<br /><br /><br />As for the 0 out of 5, what about digital goods and lotteries? Some of these take time, but you are selling information, not tangible products, so this would run all the digital goods vendors and lottery vendors ratings into the ground. That also means that buyers cannot finalize early for good faith, which is always appreciated by vendors, without automatically leaving a 0/5 feedback.<br /><br />However, paying a bit extra wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea, but then you would start having regular buyers, regular vendors, premium vendors, and it will start to spiral out of control when the SR starts charging for extra services.<br /><br />Short story, this would cause a large amount of ratings to plummet, and the system is already damaged enough as it is (the feedback and rating system has been faulty for a long time now).<br /><br />However, for the vendors reading this, there is a specific thread in the Vendor Forums where you can submit your ideas for improvements here - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22491.0<br /><br /><br /><br />Team Synaptic

				Systemically, there is absolutely no way SR can know whether a finalization is &quot;early&quot; or &quot;after the product was received&quot;.&nbsp; Example, I place an order for some bud, and a seperate order for a digital item, both at pretty much the same time.&nbsp; I immediately receive the digital item, and finalize, so that order is complete.&nbsp; Later, bud vender asks me to FE, and I do and he ships.....etc.&nbsp; There is very little that SR can do to realize that the digital item was *not* finalized early, and the cannabis was.<br /><br />so that being said, don&#039;t put the burden on SR to solve this, so called &quot;problem&quot;.&nbsp; as a vendor, you have the right to ask for FE, and as a buyer, you have the right to decline and move on with no loss.&nbsp; both parties are trying to protect their interests.&nbsp; If you must FE, start small and ask for tracking or dcn information.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found the vendors who I trust, for every product I want to buy here and more, and they all allow me to stay in escrow. <br /><br />And Synaptic, I disagree.&nbsp; as a buyer, I found that smaller vendors tend to ask for FE more often than larger vendors.&nbsp; As a regular vendor, you are shipping every day and getting funds released every day (scamming aside).&nbsp; If you&#039;re really moving product like you describe, you&#039;re never in the situation where you have no product and no money.&nbsp; Smaller vendors are much more likely to run out of product than larger vendors are.

				Another issue is when buyers leave a false 5/5...<br />They rate 5/5 but complain of non-delivery or a bad product in the comment.<br />Buyers are afraid that they&#039;ll get blacklisted by the seller if they leave anything but a 5...

That&#039;s why they paid the price, dedicate the time, and by making the customer Finalize Early the risk is shifted to the customer. As an example of trying to make money check the links below.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c92b4b3b9b<br />http://sporeworks.com/Psilocybe-cubensis-Golden-Teacher-Spore-Syringe-Microscopy-Kit.html<br />That&#039;s 5 times the price almost anyone can pay for it on the clear net.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27449.msg300045#msg300045">Quote from: Synaptic on June 20, 2012, 04:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As for Finalizing early, if a vendor requires it buy a small amount first, don&#039;t risk a large amount of money when you can test the vendor out using smaller amounts. <br /><br />From a vendors viewpoint, usually the larger vendors require FE and the smaller ones do not.

The faster you have the orders in customers hands the faster the money comes out of escrow. Most of Christy Nugs customers have their product in 2 days. That&#039;s not a long time for money to sit in escrow. If you choose to ship international or through slower means then that is a business decision.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27449.msg300045#msg300045">Quote from: Synaptic on June 20, 2012, 04:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Actually the Silk Road implemented a new system of feedback where it is gauged not only on the rating you left but the amount the item costs.<br /><br />A 1/5 feedback on a $1 item won&#039;t do much, but a 1/5 feedback on a $100 item can bring the vendor down a few digits, sometimes 10+ if they are starting out.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I did not know that and it sounds like a great idea.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27449.msg300045#msg300045">Quote from: Synaptic on June 20, 2012, 04:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As for the 0 out of 5, what about digital goods and lotteries?

Lotteries can be an automatic finalize, and digital goods can be finalize at any time. This could be built into the site, so the vendors of these products won&#039;t be affected.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there would be a problem with having different classes of vendors, verified ones and new ones long term ones.<br /><br />I agree that the system is damages, that&#039;s why I am in here bouncing around ideas.<br /><br />As there are 2 sides to any bitcoin I of course took the customer side and you being a vendor took the other. I hope you don&#039;t take our discussion as my trying to flame you, as that is not my intent. I encourage mature and open discussion on this topic and that is what you provided.<br /><br />Thank You
