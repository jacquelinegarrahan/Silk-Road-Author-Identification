				SR should seriously consider making a secondary site that is invite only. SR is to easily accessible and scammer cloning would be cut down quite a bit. Just a thought. <br /><br />Also, anybody have any success on TFM?<br />obviously SR is superior but I&#039;ve been hearing good things along the Ketamine/PCP department :P<br /><br />-RI

				What makes you think there isn&#039;t already one&nbsp; ;) ?<br /><br />Seriously though, good sellers go bad (see Goldismoney, user number 55 ffs). He&#039;d have been in the invite only site based on his longevity and feedback, and once there, he&#039;d have been able to scam harder and better towards the end.<br /><br />A combination of common sense, studying feedback and reading this forum is everything I&#039;ve needed to make I think about 10 completely successful purchases. Sellers need a constant supply of buyers to maintain their customer base and grow their businesses, and now they know a bit about buyers, they&#039;re able to refuse customers or impose restrictions on them based on their previous behaviours.

				+1 on that^^ <br />also tbh I have never ever seen the same questions posted in so many different threads...like for example &#039;Whats the best way to get bitcoins?&#039; ::) on a forum before.<br />I think that maybe an area where posters under 20 posts can ONLY post there and if nobody answers them, maybe they might search for it ;)<br /><br />I have been thinking about this 2nd SR/VIP/invite only and I think its already happening with trusted sellers settling outside escrow for buyers under 3 or whatever rating. Personally I think it will get to the stage where vendors will only sell in escrow with previous proven customers no matter the rating. As a buyer rating can be built buying cheap ebooks and such.<br /><br />&nbsp;Each seller has their own right to offer this invite to buyers. &#039;Im happy to sell to you if you&#039;re happy to pay for it now&#039;. It works...kind of like your own little invite system tailor made to suit each transaction without getting too complicated

				much of the ass-hattery on the forums is the usual shit you have to deal with on any board -<br />notably the flood of same questions asked over and over, and over.<br /><br />I think most of the early adopters of SR would be hugely in favor of this, <br />and of course there would still be the &#039;open&#039; SR, so there should be no worry about cutting out new potential customers.<br /><br />could make things a little nicer for the proven.

It means that they have a special market that they can really trust, and make special offers, etc. For us buyers, we can buy outside escrow, we can trust that the package will arrive, and if something goes wrong, isn&#039;t the buyer or the seller&#039;s fault.<br /><br />Creating a VIP space is an nice idea, since new members will have to wait and show themself&#039;s trustworthy to enter the VIP. It&#039;s not a new SR, but an better space for the honest people.<br /><br />My critic is that in the long term the VIP lounge will become an elite of SR, with all the decision power. If one has to be created, please think in the long/ short term.<br /><br />Peace and Love

				I&#039;m for a VIP area, if done right.&nbsp; An invite only SR and private board will allow for serious buyers and sellers to interact in a much easier fashion.&nbsp; I would love to have an area for experienced members to interact.&nbsp; Reduce spamming, theifs and scams.&nbsp; Reduce the dependency on the escrow system.&nbsp; It could also allow for larger transactions and a lot more security which is a huge plus.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is the issue of fragmentation though which would effect the normal silk road to the point where we could be limiting newcomers and growth. If new sellers came on board and only could deal with new buyers and vice versa that could result in alot of disappointed newcomers.&nbsp; Without alot of experienced users to guide them this could be counter productive as they could potently become jaded and turn away to other&nbsp; services.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe we can allow sellers to choose to be visible to buyers with a certain amount of history, transaction or account length.&nbsp; Or allowing buyers to better filter sellers. <br /><br />Potentially have a few forums only open to users with a certain number of posts or account age.&nbsp; <br /><br />If its done there would need to be a way to allow continued interaction between veterans and new members.<br /><br />I think this is a great idea if it is done right.<br /><br />We just need to protect against negative growth of SR&nbsp; as it would only be counter productive to the ultimate goal of what we are all trying to accomplish.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I for one would appreciate a couple additional levels of exclusivity.&nbsp; I love that SR is open and free and I know that I&#039;d never have gotten here if it were otherwise, but I as a seller who now has more business than he can handle, having a buffer or two between me and joe shmo (or some DEA agent as the case may be) is an exciting thought indeed.

				While the thought of a VIP area is interesting, IMO it would be unfair to newer buyers and those of us who only buy on occasion and more &quot;off the radar&quot;.<br /><br />I dunno, defeats the purpose of a total free market from my perspective.&nbsp; Also, SR could stand to lose a lot of business and popularity... and therefore a lot of money.<br /><br />I probably wouldn&#039;t buy here anymore if I wasn&#039;t part of the &quot;Silk Road Elite&quot;, you know?

I can guess they will keep the honest people out, because they don&#039;t know how to get an invite -- and let all the scammers in because they know how to bypass the system by trading in invites. You can&#039;t ban people by IP because we all share TOR ip space, so how do you intend to keep the banned scammers from buying their way in? Unless its a really small select few who are in, its a hard fight. In the case that it is a select few only, why ask for approval? Best go and start a site right now, and buy and sell to each other.<br /><br />Efforts would be much better spent in hardening the SR which already is in place. Make the system more bulletproof by addressing the concerns of the current system.. which by the way are? After reading this thread it seems the concerns are about keeping scammers out. Would it not be better to weaken the efforts of the scammers at the front line? To be clear, what is the specific weakness of the current system? Sellers who build rep slowly, then pull a large heist and run with the money? A solution to this can be to show stats on the seller such as amount of BTC traded and average trade size. Expose as much data as possible about new sellers. Maybe when a seller reaches Power Seller status (yes borrow some ideas from ebay where possible) then he has some more privacy. <br /><br />I say, its not a great idea to go invite only in attempt to run away from a problem on the open site -- rather brainstorm and address the issues first. Only when all avenues have been exhausted is a more private setting necessary. By all means, go and create a new site.. I&#039;m sure quite a few will pop-up and succeed, just a private torrent sites eventually took focus from mininova etc. Comparing to torrent sites is chalk and cheese though, considering the different models of business.

				hey guys im new to all of this but i feel like if you make a invite only or a vip section then nobody will buy or sell on the original SR because everyone will know they will mostlikely get ripped off or bad quality whatever they buy since the respected buyers/sellers are in the vip/invite only section<br />also for somebody to be invited in, they would have to buy/sell and get enough feed back to be trusted but they wouldnt want to buy or sell on the untrusted version of SR<br /><br />nice to meet all of you btw <br />SR just opened up my world and im gonna have so much fun

				exclusiveness has the potential to leave stigmata on people, who are not &quot;in&quot;. wether or not it&#039;s the case, people will question the quality they&#039;ll get in the normal market or part, people get jealous and suspicious. they might feel excluded etc.<br /><br />exclusiveness is often used to establish two-class societies, which in most cases is a bad thing.<br /><br />however, the concept of exclusiveness has a lot of capabilities and if done well&nbsp; and with the right tact it could definately improve the silk road enviroment.<br />but one requirement is needed:<br />everyone should have the possibility to get in.

				Seriously .... No, no, no, and no.<br /><br />The whole idea of Silk Road is that it *ISN&#039;T* invite only. There are other places and forums that are invite only that neither you or I know about or are involved in, even though we may be reputable and stand up folk, we just don&#039;t happen to know the people who are involved in the forums. Thus we can&#039;t be verified. Thus we aren&#039;t invited.<br /><br />The thing I love about Silk Road is that it is open to all. Anybody can join. That&#039;s the idea.

				I was just having this discussion via pm with a established seller, whom I wont name lol, and their idea was fabulous:<br /><br />Implement a VIB system (very important buyer) that you become once you have been invited by three sellers based on a decent history of purchases perhaps totalling a certain amount bitcoin wise so this cannot be done buying a few cheap ebooks, etc..&nbsp; Thing is, instead of a &quot;private&quot; secondary board, its all here BUT theres TWO prices:&nbsp; one for unproven potentally drama buyers (like the prices now) and one for VIB&#039;s that takes into consideration your consistant reliable non-drama creating purchases.&nbsp; This not only would encourage good behavior from buyers but would also reduce the cost of purchases so everyone can get ahead.&nbsp; Obviously a basement mushroom grower could offer a cheaper discount than a script reseller, so it would be up to the sellers as to the discount.&nbsp; Then, once a VIB buyer base is established.a.VIS ranking could be derrived from the VIB&#039;s recommending them from their experiences.&nbsp; Not perfect but open and encouraging to buyers and sellers alike.<br /><br />Its my understanding that theres a buncha buyer scams going on, which I will not elaborate on, that is causing the sellers to have to mark up as much as 20% to cover their BS.&nbsp; Several variations of these nickel and dime schemes are in play and I totally see how they would get over on sellers because of the <br />sheer cleverness and the overall trouble it would be to call these scumbag buyers out.&nbsp; Sellers, you can back me up on this if you feel me lol...&nbsp; Seriously though a few bad apples are stinking up the whole basket and closing the Road to new people sucks, hell I just found it myself and I&#039;m straight up, no drama all business no games lets just get paid consistantly year after year playa...

				You&#039;ve caught my attention, and I yours. No denying that. As for one thing I agree to this: Without sellers, this community is nothing. Without the central-ops, this community is nothing. Without the buyers... well, there will always be buyers.<br /><br />To me, the important aspect of a private setting is that the strong players stay connected. More about central-ops and networking than actual buying or selling.

I have ambitions, as do most business people, and for people like me SR is too big a blip on the government radar to be associating with forever. <br /><br />like Cali said, small fries will be fine as long as they aren&#039;t utterly retarded, but the bigger you get the softer you have to walk.

				You basically decide if you want it sanctioned by SR officially or not, then proceed. Form leadership, recruit admins + devs. You still invite the ones who voted against it -- for one, they&#039;re loyal. To tell people they won&#039;t be invited if they don&#039;t support it from *now* on... its forcing the hand a little, and you will get agreement, simply because people don&#039;t want to be left out...<br /><br />I like the route you are taking now (rook I mean) by explaining it in a way that will win genuine support, not the shallow &quot;i don&#039;t wanna be left out&quot; support.<br /><br />

				What if there is already a private site and none of you were invited? would that make you sad?<br /><br />the fact is that there are already plenty of private sited, and many here on SR are members of them. the way they stay private is by not being listed, or really even talked about on PUBLIC boards, why would a private SR site be any different?<br /><br />If you are dealing with someone on here who is a member of a private board, chances are that when they feel comfortable enough with you, they will invite you/ vouch for you on something private.<br /><br />I guess what I am trying to say is, Silk Road was made to be public. It should stay public. There are already private sites out there. Maybe one already exists that is based on/ run by the same people. Patience is a virtue, you cant go from some unknown guy to &quot;made&quot; over night. If you have outgrown the public board and not been invited to at least one private one, your not talking to the right folks, or your doing something wrong.

				I&#039;m surprised no one here thought of the biggest hole in this idea. <br /><br />Lets say there was a separate SR. Presumably, the only ones with access would be the best people on SR, the people we all buy from, whom are trustworthy and work hard to send their product out to everyone. These people, the ones that make SR what it is, would then all be functioning on a different server/system.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t that be a giant beacon of hope for LE? To take down one server with all of the largest sellers? Don&#039;t think SR is too secure for that. There are always flaws. There have been many LE agents who have infiltrated much more secure organizations, IRL. This section would become the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.<br /><br />You would then be left with a regular SR full of scammers and mediocre sellers. Not that more wouldn&#039;t emerge. This idea would pose a huge security risk, IMO. <br /><br />Not to mention in order to divert the constant attacks and infiltration attempts, a large part of SR would be busy with SRVIP and not SR. This would be totally lopsided since the larger service load would be on regular SR<br /><br />Please understand that I am no omniscient nor do i have an intimate understanding of how most of these things work. Just a newbie giving his two cents. <br /><br />Peace.

				Yea, SR should stay open. A private forum for SR might be acceptable.<br /><br />But if there was a VIP area of the road I think all it would do is hurt the economy by making it so trusted members would look there first for product from people they&#039;ve done business with before. If too many people do this it will make it difficult for new vendors to get a flow going, then we all get access to less drugs :(<br /><br />I am curious about the private forums mentioned above that people order off (*hint, if anybody&#039;s on one and has done enough business with me to know that I am a man of my word**), but they scare the shit out of me. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d use them until SR goes down, but it would be nice to have another backup plan...

That wouldn&#039;t stop a DEA agent who was researching the Road by buying various quantities of stuff and examining the packaging closely.&nbsp; The fact that a participant has been on this forum a long time? That wouldn&#039;t stop an LEO who took on SR as an ongoing project.&nbsp; Because some site moderator is convinced X could never be a cop? Nobody ever thinks that guy could be an undercover cop until the cuffs are on: a good undercover operative is going to bend over backwards to appear stable and trustworthy. <br /><br />For that matter, any &quot;trusted&quot; member can become a valuable asset to the prosecution once they get busted.&nbsp; That guy you&#039;re sharing your Paypal address with as you discuss your next big Ecstasy purchase might have been popped for offline activities last week.&nbsp; For all you know they&#039;ve cut a deal and the federales are listening in on your every word.&nbsp; (Ask Justin &quot;W00t/Dirk Diggler&quot; Scroggins about this).<br /><br />Sorry, but the Grand Wizard gives a thumbs down to the idea of private/VIP forums or markets. They serve no useful purpose and can bring more trouble than they&#039;re worth.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Excellent point, TheGrandWizard. <br />+1<br /><br />sdesu

				Really wish I was established enough here to find a great private market because I am already getting tired of this SR BS. I learn my lesson not to FE on Tony76 and I am still going to probably get fucked by evilution like it sounds everyone else is even though I didn&#039;t FE. 50% Refund isn&#039;t fair on large amounts and it just seems that there are way more scammers on here than when I got on and that was only a couple months ago.

				Don&#039;t worry big players are already in touch in a way or another, and you&#039;ll not be part of it if you don&#039;t already have connections, often initiated IRL (because i would never trust someone i don&#039;t know if i was meant to make big business)<br /><br />I like SR to be public, because i&#039;m not in the scene anymore, left the city,&nbsp; lost connections because of life/work/family/other hobbies going on and i&#039;m VERY happy to be able to obtain quality drugs for personnal and friend use, that i cannot have in real life or way more expensive and not of reliable quality&nbsp; (except cannabis which is incredibly expensive on SR) Individuals need good drugs for personnal/friends use!!! If it was not public, nobody would invite me and goodbye the fun vibe for the most part.<br /><br />There is BS on SR, but whoever bought drugs IRL knows that this is not a guaranteed business, often more dangerous. I&#039;ve been more ripped off IRL than on SR, due to the &quot;community&quot; trying to push out the scammers. On SR i lost a little bit money, but i never had a knife nor a gun pointed at me to be robbed, i never was forced to buy shitty quality under violent pressure,&nbsp; i never had to wait in sketchy part of town for hours waiting for my man to show up. So now, i prefer way more my SR purchases than IRL. Lurk the forums for hours before making a purchase and that&#039;ll do.<br /><br />Thanks DPR, the admins, the forums mods, the sellers and everyone making it possible.<br /><br />++

I mean how scary would it be jumping on IRC, sending someone BTC directly to some wallet and then patiently waiting for your product to arrive?

				I would love to see something both in the forums and within the main site itself for buyers and sellers who operate at a more trusted level.
