				Why are some people on here so quick to trust a brand new vendor with their address?&nbsp; It just seems odd to me.&nbsp; I love free drugs like anyone else but I am not about to give my address to a Vendor with NO REPUTATION or feedback.&nbsp; What do you guys think about this?

				To be fair, a lot of the people that do that use abandoned addresses or P.O Boxes in fake names...

				Haha this actually came up on another thread the other day and we were saying it&#039;s madness. I don&#039;t take samples full-stop even if offered but I have no idea why anyone would take them off new vendors. Only way I MAY take a sample is if they charged and it was an established vendor with a new product and I dunno if I&#039;d bother then.

				I took a sample recently, just for that reason--it went to a PO box that really can&#039;t be traced to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />But you&#039;re right, Lim, it&#039;s pretty thoughtless (too many chems were distracting me from thinking it through...).&nbsp; Everything worked out, but I see no reason why I would ever place an order from a non-established vendor again.&nbsp; Was dumb.<br /><br />Keep spreading this message.

				I get all my stuff from the SR sent to my ex girlfriends house (addressed to me); when the stuff arrives, I call up for a kiss and a cuddle ;) and then get my drugs and go home again.<br /><br />Only one way for a vendor to start off on the road, so I don&#039;t mind giving them their first orders!<br /><br />My ex is well briefed on how to handle LE if that situation ever arises and she knows not to ever open the envelopes, so I reckon it is safe enough. <br />I took Limetless&#039; advice also and told her to write &#039;Return to Sender&#039; on all envelopes address to me and leave them by the door, which surely adds more safety for ordering samples.<br /><br />Currently waiting on a g of coke from GlobalCocaine and i&#039;m very excited to try that!

				Yeah you should always put return to sender on it. The minions that receive my orders always do it as soon as they get them.

				the problem with samples is they kind of fall into that &#039;greed&#039; category that LE likes to exploit... if the address is non-traceable and you ARE NOT a vendor using your vendor account then &#039;go for it&#039;...&nbsp; me personally.. I would never offer nor ask for a sample... too damn risky...

				Me and DrGonzoII have received a ton of samples from unestablished vendors with no problem. The only time I use a local address is if it&#039;s for weed, because that would just be fucking stupid for LEO to chase me down for something I have a card for. ;D<br /><br />Other than that I use drop offs that I check every day when I&#039;m expecting a shipment. I only take samples from those with an actual vendor account, and only from those I feel are trustworthy. Basically everyone needs to start from somewhere and it&#039;s cool to get something from a vendor and later on see them become a big success. What it really comes down to though, is that I just don&#039;t give a shit, and I don&#039;t think anyone else gives one either. So what if I ordered an eighth of shrooms, or 100mgs of DMT, or small things like that. It just isn&#039;t worth chasing me down from LEO&#039;s perspective. I&#039;ll likely never order anything as hazardous as coke, meth, or heroin on here, nor do I purchase enough to even make a profit. Compared to everyone else on this site, I&#039;m a small fry. :P<br /><br />I have a better chance getting caught vandalizing or tagging a Starbucks than I do buying drugs from the Silk Road. ;D
