				So I am trying to figure out if the stuff my local dealer sold me is MDMA or Methylone.&nbsp; I am convinced it is not MDMA for a few reasons -&nbsp; Takes about 30ish minutes to hit (usual for MDMA) sells it to me in capsule for that he packs himself, tells me they are 125mg each.&nbsp; It takes me 2x 125mg aka 250mg to even feel anything.&nbsp; Only done them 3x in the last 5 months, so I shouldn&#039;t have a big tolerance to these.&nbsp; <br /><br />The high is great feeling starting off, happy, wide awake, can talk a lot.&nbsp; Not much of the loving feeling where you tell everyone around you how awesome they are, more of like a hell yeah I feel great and I can dance at the same time feeling.&nbsp; &nbsp;After about 2~ hours, it is completely gone the feeling, and even if I pop another 250mg, I can&#039;t replicate that same feeling.&nbsp; Usually most GOOD MDMA I have had, can last me 4-6 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only thing noticeably different about this batch, is the next day I almost have 0 hangover, from MDMA / Ex pills I can get a horrible hang over the next day.<br /><br />Thoughts?&nbsp; What has been the noticeable difference for you guys comparing Methylone to MDMA?

				That does sound more like methylone to me dude.&nbsp; While Methylone is surely enjoyable and talkative like you said, it doesn&#039;t carry that spark of urgent excitement or the profound empathy that good molly gives you, and it lasts far shorter, and less than 200 mg&#039;s probably won&#039;t do much.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in the US, its extremely common for molly to be sold cut with/replaced with M1.&nbsp; I&#039;d buy some off here instead&nbsp; ;D

				Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I have been reading some peoples descriptions of Methylone off google and looks like it is more than likely it.&nbsp; <br /><br />When doing MDMA I can have crazy conversations with people, on his so called MDMA I am more just feeling great but less talkative.&nbsp; Unfortunately it has probably been close to 3 years since I have actually experienced AWESOME Extasy / MDMA so I am having trouble deciphering the two.&nbsp; 95% of the time I buy &quot;MDMA&quot; or EX in the US, it has had almost 0 effect on me.&nbsp; I am done, done buying from street people going to stick to my SR :)&nbsp; <br /><br />I have ordered some MDMA, and about to order some Methylone and compare the two,I want to call my friend out on this.&nbsp; I just called him and asked him if his &quot;MDMA&quot; is actually Methylone, he says he has never heard of Methylone.&nbsp; &nbsp; Hopefully my Methylone gets here by Saturday...lol.<br /><br />

				To me the difference is the eye wiggles and jelly legs you get from about 150 mg of good mdma. I have never had that experience on methylone. Methylone is definitely what I would consider good &quot;molly&quot; where I come from before I found this site. I had done a few good pressies back in the day but had a long hiatus from the stuff and now it&#039;s cut to shit if there even is any mdma at all. Sounds like you got methylone which isn&#039;t bad but if being bought at mdma prices it&#039;s a rip off.
