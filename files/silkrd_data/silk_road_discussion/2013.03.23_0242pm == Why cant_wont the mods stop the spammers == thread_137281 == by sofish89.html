				Everytime I open&nbsp; subject on the forums I see the same thred listed over and over &quot;Come get 50 bitcoins plus bonus for only $$1199 blah blah blah&quot;.<br />Cant the mods block this guy, or do we all have to complain about him enough times to get him blocked? It&#039;s very annoying when I&#039;m looking for a thread and its buried 3 pages behind this guy because he made 9 threads a in a row..<br />

				It must be hard to select moderators on this forum. I would honestly love to be one, but theres prob some major security issues with bringing someone on. They are def understaffed as far as moderators and spam goes

				I think they are just creating a new account so impossible to stop it. SR block the spammer and they just rejoin. Nothing can be done.

				Ya but if you look at the users online on SR fourms Index page it will show the moderators in a diff color. I usually never see more then one, then again they could be incognito

				They most certainly could stop the spammers. Literally stop them cold. <br /><br />For example, they could ban the key words that the spammers use - for example, the spammers web address.<br /><br />Why they don&#039;t do this is a mystery to me. I have stopped asking because answers are never given.

				I have already messaged the mods in the past about this.<br /><br />The problem is that the 50 posts are not vetted.<br /><br />What needs to happen is that a person is limited to 5-10 posts per day (that way it takes at least 5 days to hit 50)<br /><br />Once a person hits 50 posts they then need a mod to manually review their posts before being given permission to use the main forum.<br /><br />If a persons posts are just junk that&#039;s being posted to make the 50 post mark then the posts should be deleted and the person has to start again.<br /><br />Forum users should be encouraged to report junk posts in the newbie section so as to make the mods job easier to review their posts.<br /><br />Currently there are posts in the newbie section with titles like &quot;spam your way to 50&quot; if the 50 post rule is to have any useful function then these types of thread have to be stopped.&nbsp; Unless someone actually reviews the posts then the 50 post rule does little to prevent spammers.<br /><br />

				We&#039;ve made these suggestions to DPR before, but my guess is he has more pressing issues to deal with so there&#039;s been no response about it.&nbsp; That said, I&#039;m on here 16-18 hours a day deleting the spam as it comes up, but I do have to sleep sometimes, as does the other mod.

				Yep, I think there have been a lot of us who suggested that there be a limit on new members&#039; postings per hour and that would allow a lower post count requirement, but never heard anything back in response.&nbsp; After about the 3rd or 4th time, I quit suggesting it.
