				Hey Guys and Gals,<br /><br />We at EnthusedUK have been looking into growing magic mushrooms and we have a few questions :) <br />Is there much of a demand for them especially in the UK? If so any particular type? What sort of prices would be appropriate? Would you prefer fresh or dried mushrooms? <br />We&#039;ve also looked at magic truffles which look rather interesting. Would there be anyone interested in truffles? <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Moo x <br />

				i prefer acid to mushrooms but i will tell you that the public view of lsd is that of fear. when you have acid new/infrequent drug users get nervous to try it. but when you have shrooms seems like most people are more willing to try them. they tend to think of it as a lighter hallucinogen i guess. im not sure why this is true for me in my experiences... when i have shrooms i can sell it to the people who wont buy acid. good luck to you, friend<br /><br />ps- i love all hallucinogens!

				<br />&nbsp;im not UK... but i love mush. didn&#039;t order any from SR yet but Im planning to. maybe summertime...<br />&nbsp;I think P. Cubensis would sell. Ppl who are inexperienced would prefer it because its the most famous stain.<br />Prices? look at the competition 8)! <br />Dried! <br />As far as i know the truffles are less potent and would be harder to ship because it weighs more.... This could be problem? There is a market for it. but its not big and i think its more like a &quot;lets try this once or twice&quot; instead of regular customers.....

				yes i love shrooms! hawaiian would be awesome but i got a feeling they&#039;re harder to grow or yield less or something. any psilocybe cubensis is cool, only thing i have experience with. dried ideally because shipping fresh would be a nightmare. i put them through a coffee grinder then in gel caps to avoid the taste. truffles are fun but not quite as potent and taste rank so i wouldn&#039;t buy them here, only have them in nl. definitely get them going in time for summer they should sell fine then :)

				I think theres always demand for shrooms, especially if your prices are reasonable, your customer service is efficient and the quality of your grow is good.<br /><br />i have 3.5g of B+ cubensis and about the same of liberty caps. im considering making some Chocolate with them, any experiances of mixing mushrooms?

				Growing them is awesome. Fresh ones are little xtra neato :P<br /><br />Research it because u can lose potency drying them incorrectly.<br /><br />Have fun :)

				I love truffles but are hard to get a hold of in the UK so I&#039;m sure you might ship a bit, especially to me.<br /><br />Nice controllable trip &amp; tasty too :)
