				I was looking at it a couple of hours ago, then I got high and spent four compulsive hours on the forum, and now I can&#039;t find it. I&#039;m pretty sure it was recent, but the search engine isn&#039;t helping me. It mentioned things like &#039;Drink a glass of water&#039; and &#039;Shower&#039;. Did anyone else see it? Special surprise for the first person to help me out (Spoiler: It&#039;s a Bitcoin).

				This is not it, but I appreciate the effort. PM me with a deposit address (make sure to get a new one! i made that mistake last week and missed out on the last of BM&#039;s gear. I&#039;ll never forgive myself...) and I&#039;ll toss you a consolation prize for trying to be helpful.

				is this it?<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=50267.30<br /><br />&quot;Meth is my weapon of choice but there&#039;s a science to it, i always have my xanax to help put my mind to sleep and help me avoid staying up and getting into neurotoxicity and always drink a ton of water and eat something every 4-5hrs even if its just a protein bar or shake. If you have had an addiction in the past I would absolutely warn against trying it especially since the substance you were abusing was in the same family tree. If you thought adderall was addictive Meth is far more hard to manage reponsibly. I&#039;m not trying to tell anyone how to live their life but i just don&#039;t want someone to make a decision that looks like at this point it could be a serious relapse.&nbsp; Best of luck and be safe no matter what, your life&#039;s more important than a high thats for sure!&quot;
