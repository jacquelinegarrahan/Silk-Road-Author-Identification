				don&#039;t know how many here were around during the &quot;sexual&quot; revolution and the peace protests of the 60s/70s - had just gotten back from the svc, and it was a whole new world. Enrolled in the local college and got introduced to &quot;panama red&quot; and changed my politics overnight. man we had some great weed back then (i know that has got to sound like an old geezer, which i am, talking about how much better it was back then. But it was in some ways - Panama Red (was great great week), Colombian Gold and Jamaican were the predominant strains available with Pan Red being the hardest to get. <br /><br />Then i went into business and started working at 7:00AM and didn&#039;t come home usually till 7-9:00PM and didn&#039;t have time for weed - i kid not, i noticed after a few months that i hadn&#039;t toked in too long.<br /><br />now some 40+ years later, i look at the market and holy shit, there are a ton of strains, all with categorized highs, some offering &quot;couch lock&quot;highs to energetic euphoria highs and everything in between. <br /><br />in some ways i envy the opportunities you guys have - in some ways i miss the freedoms and lack of technology we had back then, and no, i&#039;m not a Archie Bunker. With the low technology, cops had to work for their intel. hell, i got pulled one time in a little datsun 1200, had just done a U-turn on Broad Street (every town back then called it&#039;s main thoroughfare thru the city &quot;Broad street&quot;, and done it right in front of a cop car - problem was there no left turn allowed much less a U-turn. i was high as a kite, car was absolutely full of smoke and i tried as discreetly as possible to open the windows to let it air out as much as possible before he walked up to the car - wasn&#039;t very successful, i climbed out - he asked what i thought i was doing, making that U-turn - don&#039;t know how i thought of it, i said, sorry, i got distracted by something my girlfriend just said and didn&#039;t see the &#039;no left turn&#039; sign, then when i made the turn and saw i was turning onto a one-way street the wrong way, i made it into a u-turn. he asked, what&#039;d she say, my response: &quot;she just told me she&#039;s pregnant&quot;. he looked inside at her and MC beemed this smile as wide as her face. He looked at me, turned and walked back to his cruiser. <br /><br />LSD was being promoted by Timothy OLeary and my philosophy teacher alike, but the stuff scared me - <br /><br />did some crystal meth, and luckily there wasn&#039;t any more around when it was finished or i&#039;d look like some of those &quot;before/after&quot; shots of the crack addicts, with half my teeth missing.<br /><br />that was excitement back then (and no, i didn&#039;t walk five miles to school barefoot in the snow). Shit, today you guys are looking / doing at chemicals i&#039;ve never even heard of<br /><br />&nbsp;and that&#039;s why i came to SR - looking to find some weed or seeds like the stuff we used to toke back when<br /><br />sorry, old fart ranting -&nbsp; elvis is leaving the bldg

				I too miss the lack of technology even 10-15 years ago.. back when the internet was a novelty reserved for &quot;nerds&quot;. Ah, the old days of bbs and usenet! Before the explosion of web 2.0, blogs, and the zombiefying/narcissistic scourge that is social media.<br /><br />In a way, the darkweb reminds me of that old internet of days long past.<br /><br />Thanks for the snippet into your own life, tbart. :)

				What you have posted StillRuthless is fuckery and a violation of all that we hold dear on this site. For shame, and may you be raped by a thousand angry bears with vd.

				My time was the late 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s in the UK. We had ecstasy and traveling raves - in beautiful rural locations in the summer, and cavernous warehouses and hangars in the winter. <br /><br />There wasn&#039;t much political to it, to those involved anyway. To the authorities and the sensationalist press it seemed to be something to oppress and be afraid of. It was pure hedonism really, though I suppose there were times when it felt a bit like a revolution. Watching the sun rise over the welsh hills, on your third e of the night, surrounded by likeminded youngsters and new, exciting music.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had plenty of MDMA in the past couple of years thanks to SR, and it&#039;s great, but it&#039;s not the same without the rave and the feeling of being part of something.<br /><br />Here are some words and phrases which may make you smile if you&#039;re someone like me:<br /><br />Rhubarb and custard<br />Doves<br />M25 convoy<br />Sunrise<br />Genesis<br />Spiral Tribe<br />Lechlade<br /><br />I wish I had kept the flyers.<br /><br />
