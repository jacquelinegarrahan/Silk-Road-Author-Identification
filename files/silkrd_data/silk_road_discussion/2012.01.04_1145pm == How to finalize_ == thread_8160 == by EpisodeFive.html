				Hi guys, I&#039;m new here so please forgive me if this is in the wrong place or something like that.<br /><br />I just placed an order with Pharmville and looking at the order, it still says &quot;processing&quot;. There is no &quot;final&quot; button on the page, and I can&#039;t find the finalize button anywhere.<br /><br />Does the seller have to approve an order or something before I can finalize? It&#039;s my first order and I&#039;m prepared to finalize early if that&#039;s necessary, but I just don&#039;t know how.<br /><br />Thanks guys, sorry again if this is a stupid question/in the wrong place.

				lol I&#039;m not freaking out or anything. It&#039;s just been a while since I placed the order and I wanted to be sure it wasn&#039;t something on my end.<br /><br />Thanks for the answer though. Mods can close this if they want.

				You were smart to make your first order with PharmVille. Hes down for the cause and he wont fuck you. His packaging methods are super stealthy and his products are as advertised.

				And why finalize early if you&#039;re not being asked to? The escrow system is there for your benefit.

				And if you finalize early then for some reason need customer support, you will hear <br />&quot;Did you finalize early, if so, I can provide no support. ~SR Support&quot;<br /><br />Though Pharmville is a great guy (guys), you should never finalize early for ANYONE.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				quick update to anyone wondering/any newbies that have the same question as I did last week.<br /><br />My order with pharmville unfortunately didn&#039;t pan out (product was out of stock), but I did order a similar product with paperchasing. Pharmville was extremely courteous and apologetic about the cancelled order, and I will definitely try business with him again as he was quick in responding to me and answering all of the questions I asked him. I&#039;m sure most of you have already heard good things about them, and you can put this down as another good review. Full refund was given quickly, and as I mentioned, he was very helpful about everything.<br /><br />My order with Paperchasing was excellent as well, and my product literally arrived 2 days after I ordered with standard shipping. I don&#039;t know if this is due to proximity or if his shipping is just that quick, but it was really amazing. The package was discrete and the product was great (enjoying it right now, as a matter of fact). He didn&#039;t require early finalization which was cool (neither did Pharmville), and I can go ahead and strongly recommend him as well.<br /><br />I also have to put a good word in for mxchamp148 who many of you may know for his big bud 2-for-1 sale. I&#039;ve been in contact with him all through today and he&#039;s unbelievably helpful. Placed my order for his Big Bud today (which I&#039;ve heard good things about). Haven&#039;t gotten the package yet obviously, since I just ordered a few hours ago, but I&#039;m sure it will be fantastic. If anyone is looking for some high quality weed (have smoked BB before, it&#039;s great) at a great price and with a good deal, check him out. He&#039;s a relatively new seller with not as many transactions as top vendors, but his service is fuckin&#039; great.<br /><br />Obviously, I got the kinks worked out on the finalizing part of all of this. To any of the mods/technical staff of SR, thanks a lot for all of your help, and for this great site. Here&#039;s to hoping it stays open for a good long time&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Cheers!

				How long does it normally take before it changes from processing to in transit or something like that? <br />I&#039;m ordering from one of the top vendors.

I guess it just depends on when the vendor gets around to checking your order and getting it packaged and everything. For someone with a bunch of orders to fill (like top vendors) it probably just takes a little while to get everything ready.
