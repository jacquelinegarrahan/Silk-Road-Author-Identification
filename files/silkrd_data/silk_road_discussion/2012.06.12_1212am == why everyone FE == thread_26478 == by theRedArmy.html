And, buy digital goods that can be had almost all without FE, until you build your buyer ratings. Then those freaking sellers don&#039;t have a reason to ask you to FE.

				Being a new buyer, I can let you know that most sellers will ask me to FE as only have 2 purchases so far. If I go with a seller who does not request FE, then it is a less trusted seller and severely limits my options.

In my experience this past month I&#039;ve gone from 0-12 purchases, almost all have been legit, in escrow, paid on receiving AND with trusted reputable vendors. However, this probably reflects the different products being bought.<br /><br />In fact, one purchase was between two listings, product and shipping. I FE&#039;d on the shipping, and now the guy has flaked (the product has been in &#039;processing&#039; for over two weeks now). Never FE unless you can afford to lose it.

They are the ones for the long haul and to be used again and again. For those that ask you to FE right away, even if you have ok stats are just looking to make a quick buck and basically, don&#039;t use them. I&#039;ve dealt with both. I would %100 rather deal with the expertise of the professional on here in these situations.

				I guess it probably depends on what you are in the market for. I&#039;ve never been asked to FE by anyone, and I would never do it if they did.

				Just going back to all the reviews just saying &quot;FE&quot;, would it be better to have a leave feedback later option? Looking at feedback is useless when all it says is FE, FE, FE......

If you have low stats then the seller is attempting to protect themselves. Buyers scam much more then sellers. For this reason FE is the choice of many vendors. I suggest either deal with it or build up your stats and deal with select vendors. I start off slow and small with a new vendor. I like to sample the product and evaluate service and product quality first hand. I try to limit test order amounts to $50 or less. If that goes well I make a few more larger orders, lets say $100, $175 and $200. By the time those orders are taken care of me and the vendor have dealt with each other a few times and we have a level of trust. Its at this point that I would ask the vendor for a larger order.

If you do not leave feedback right away the option too do so will stay in your orders section until you do. Back when the site was having some problems I finalized and tried to leave feedback thought it worked until the next day I clicked my order page and the feedback option was still there waiting. I also on a later order did not leave feedback right away to test it and the next day it still gave me the option so you DO NOT have to leave feedback right away, the option will stay until you actually do. Not sure how long you have but I am sure it would be at least a week or 2.
