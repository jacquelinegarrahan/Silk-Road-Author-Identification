				First off, I&#039;m new here so I thought I&#039;d ask a couple of questions before I place an ad.<br /><br />I spent 2 months on a marketing project for a lighting company - during this time, I invoiced them for 2000 GBP. It&#039;s not been 6 months and they haven&#039;t paid, despite letters, phonecalls and threats of legal action. <br /><br />Fortunately, I know that clients can be like this sometimes - so I created a seperate FTP account for myself that no-one at the company knows about. <br /><br />The company in question brings in around Â£100000 from their ecommerce website- and has around 1000 visits per day. I&#039;m guessing the right person can do a hell of a lot with this information. <br /><br />I know it&#039;s quite unethical but they should have thought about that before they ripped me off.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does anyone know where I would place an add for these details?

				FTP access is logged logged logged to high-heaven.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t, do NOT access that FTP. You will be logged and potentially open your self up for prosecution; that is of course assuming you did not disable logging for this username you created.

				I agree with the opinions expressed.<br />You can be found, is it worth it.<br /><br />That being said, I know of people who put &quot;time bombs&quot; in their software just for this occasion.<br />Customer pays, they make a courtesy call, no harm done.<br />Customer doesn&#039;t pay, time bomb goes off, they call you, and pay up front ;)<br /><br />Again still has legal issues to it, less likely to be found, quickly anyhow.

				I remember my days on the warez scene there were .biz sites.&nbsp; These were usually put up by people inside the companies so I thought.&nbsp; I was on one that was hosted at Novell.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m wondering if this is how these ftp sites popped up.&nbsp; Disgruntled repairmen...
