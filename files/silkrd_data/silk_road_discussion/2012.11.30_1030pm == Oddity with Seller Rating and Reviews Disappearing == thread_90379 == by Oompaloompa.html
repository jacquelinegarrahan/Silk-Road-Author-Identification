				I&#039;ve noticed something odd.<br />I made an order from a new vender, got the product &amp; left a rating &amp; review. When I checked&nbsp; few days later my review wasn&#039;t there, some other reviews were there that I recognised from before &amp; there were some new ones. My review wasn&#039;t pushed off as there were only 2 pages, less than 20 reviews.<br />I should say that my rating/review still shows up in my view feedback section of my account, just not on the sellers page.<br /><br />Another oddity is that the items listed next to all the reviews had changed. They all show either Kamagra or MSJ Diazepam, but these weren&#039;t listed previously it was some relatively unusual tryptamines.<br />Seller currently has no active listings <br /><br />This is seriously puzzling me and I&#039;m concerned that there&#039;s some way to change, hide or obscure buyer ratings. <br />Can anyone - especially sellers - give me any idea of whats going on here?<br />

				I think when a vendor deletes a listing, the feedback is removed as well for that listing? So if a seller takes down one product, those reviews won&#039;t be on the vendor&#039;s main page anymore, but reviews from products still listed will be there?&nbsp; Am I on crack or did I really hear this from a legit forum person?&nbsp; :o

Other vendors still retain feedback when they&#039;ve no items listed so I think feedback on their main pages stays put.<br /><br />Also from the period when he came onto SR to when I purchased he only listed an obscure tryptamine, DPT, but the feedbacks from then now show as being fom pharmaceuticals.<br /><br />
