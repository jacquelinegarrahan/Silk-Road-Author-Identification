				Find what you want and then look at the seller&#039;s feedback.&nbsp; If they have a lot of positive feedback then that is a good sign.&nbsp; If they have a PGP key for sending encrypted messages, even better.&nbsp; Look at the rumor mill section for any information on the seller to make sure, and if there isn&#039;t any, start a thread and ask about other peoples experiences with the seller.&nbsp;

				Long Time Sellers as you put it would be vendors with userID numbers of 2500 or less.<br />You can find out userID numbers by hovering your mouse icon over the vendors name and the url pops up in the bottom left of the screen with the userID number being the last number listed on the url.
