				You dont. Find someone else to buy from if your vendor is requiring it, and report them as it is against the rules of SR.

				You have to wait for the seller to mark your order in Transit but finalizing early is the easiest way to get scammed!!

It&#039;s against the spirit of SR, and in finalising early you lose the buyer protection escrow gives you, but it isn&#039;t against the rules.

				It&#039;s a little confusing I suppose. Doing transactions completely out of escrow (i.e., direct btc transfer) is against the rules, but finalising early is still technically in the escrow system (i.e., SR gets his cut) and so is discouraged but allowed.<br /><br />Basically it&#039;s allowed because sellers use it as a way of allowing new customers to make purchases without them having to risk losing money to scamming buyers who&#039;d register a new account to make a purchase, then claim non-delivery.<br /><br />I&#039;d say the best thing to do as an honest new buyer is either to work with someone who will allow you to do the transaction completely within escrow (not easy to find), or to work only with the very most top rated sellers the first few deals, and finalise early in the knowledge that their good rep means they are not likely to scam you.
