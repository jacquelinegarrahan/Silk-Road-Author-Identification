				Hey SR Community,<br /><br />For the past 3 days I have been intermittently getting the following drop down message about 25% of the time when I click the &quot;view the most recent posts on the forum&quot; link at the bottom of the front page:<br /><br /><br />Load external content?<br /><br />***An external application is needed to handle:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=recent;start=70<br /><br />NOTE: External applications are NOT Tor safe by default and can unmask you!<br /><br />If this file is untrusted, you should either save it to view while offline or in a VM,<br />or consider using a transparent Tor proxy like Amnesia LiveCD, torsocks, or TorVM.***<br /><br />This had never happened from the time I joined the SR forum until 7/25.&nbsp; When I was instructed on using Tor I was told *specifically* not to open any file that would have even the possibility of unmasking me.&nbsp; This included opening this kind of file on a cleartext version of Foxfire that was open concurrently with the one inside of the Tor Bundlle.<br /><br />I hope someone who is in charge and knows the reason this is happening will make a post on this thread.<br /><br />Is anyone else having this problems?&nbsp; &nbsp; Or am I the only LUCKY one?&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />

				It really depends on what program you are using to display the file.<br /><br />If its a simple text file, then you are probably fine...&nbsp; Using an external program to show Tor files isnt necessarily bad.&nbsp; You just have to know what type of file it is, and what risks that entails.&nbsp; NEVER open PDF files in this manner, they can &#039;phone home&#039; using your normal connection and tell whomever that this ip downloaded this file on this site via tor. <br /><br />Thats a BIG risk, Just be careful and if you don&#039;t know what you are doing, then dont do it.&nbsp; <br />If you are like me and you THINK you know what you are doing, its still best to not do it.<br /><br />again, I&#039;m lazy, CAPS == italics

				No one is trying to reveal your identity,&nbsp; it&#039;s the HTTP protocol.<br /><br />You start to download the HTML file ... The connection start... But the line is slow thus it times out.<br /><br />Your file is not fully downloaded thus it&#039;s not a valid HTML file, thus it&#039;s treated as a text file.<br /><br /><br />Remember: never download anything.
