				To get here, you have to have used the Internet enough to have learned of Tor, smart enough to actually use Tor(not very hard but alot of people couldnt do it), and open minded enough to acknowledge that drugs arent the product of a collaboration of Hitler, Lucifer, and Cthulu. <br /><br /><br />Other drug forums such as Bluelight and Erowid all seem to be plagued by teenagers who can&#039;t form eloquence beyond slang, worship cannabis, and don&#039;t do any research. The only (not necessarily drug)websites I could possibly think of that could compete with this site are like, 7Chan, which is too 7Channy, and HackBB, where greed is too prevalent. <br /><br />With this high(especially by comparison) knowledge barrier of entry, does this inherently make SR and it&#039;s forums the overall most intelligent place on the Internet? Anyone think of a site that could possibly compete?

				i don&#039;t like the publicity that SR now has.&nbsp; &nbsp;it&#039;s too much.&nbsp; I joined in January of 2012&nbsp; (my sig is outdated)&nbsp; <br /><br />I now think theres too many people on here.&nbsp; &nbsp;its not longer the little community it once was.&nbsp; &nbsp;New people unforunately has brought a HELL of a lot more scammers,&nbsp; a lot more junkies,&nbsp; and a lot more BULLSHIT.&nbsp; &nbsp; I liked the old SR where I could buy the best cocaine I&#039;d ever had from MIN,&nbsp; or get some good MDMA from Tony76 (before he turned scammer) <br /><br />Now I feel like SR has lost that feeling.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t get me wrong,&nbsp; I still love this place and I have just a few vendors I rely on.&nbsp; But I truly hope that the security of this site is good enough to prevent the USA government from shutting it down,&nbsp; because I know for a fact that they&#039;re all over it.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				There&#039;s a common misconception that you somehow have to be a 1337 hacker genius to get on here, but nothing could be further from the truth. Torbrowser makes setting up Tor as easy as that of any other browser. Sure, it&#039;s mildly inconvenient to have to exchange dollars to bitcoins, and sure, you have to practice for a couple minutes before you get PGP encryption (not even required though), but other then that, the difficultly curve is on par with paypal. There&#039;s even youtube videos and clearnet sites that walk you through every minute detail of the process. <br /><br />Read through a few posts. You&#039;ll notice very quickly that this is not a bastion of free thought and intellectual discourse. Although there&#039;s a few very intelligent people on here, for the most part, this place is one step above /b/.

What might be refreshing is perhaps someone saying &quot;I feel like I try hard to achieve but maybe I could do more, let&#039;s discuss how I could reach my full potential&quot; or something along those lines? Because in life nobody can ever rest on their laurels because then you stand still as a human being. It&#039;s quite obvious that some people here forget this and that they think just buy buying shit on SR, using BTC and talking philosophically for a few minutes a day on here makes them some sort of bona fide hardcore revolutionary anarchist and you can tell because they love to stick that term on themselves more than George Cloony likes to take credit for shit at award ceremonies in his smug fuck-face way. <br /><br />So yeah, OP, shut the fuck up and stop talking and go and do something real. Congratulations and praise are to be given by others not by oneself. <br /><br />

I keep seeing more and more of this po-faced bullshit lately and it&#039;s part of the reason I had a break from here. What exactly gives you the right to take on such a self-satisfied, arrogant and to be honest, cuntish stance just because you get your shit off the net? I bet these people think their shit smells like strawberries and can be served as a refreshing snack on a warm summers evening too. <br /><br />Christ what absolute twaddle. If you think you can sit back and admire the view just because you use this as a drug source then you need to take a step back and look at your life and go and achieve something real.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So harsh, yet so poetic hahaha.. I thoroughly enjoy every one of your diatribes ;D<br /><br />I think it&#039;s safer to assume that using this medium SUCCESSFULLY requires some form of intelligence.. the more I use this and understand its workings (and even politics), the more I start to admire it as a whole. It definitely is one of the more interesting parts of the internet.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well it&#039;s true, I&#039;m trying to cut down on the rants but the kind of rubbish cheapens this forum because it just makes it look like it&#039;s full of self-satisfied and self-important prigs (I said prigs, not pricks) and has to be clipped. What might be refreshing is perhaps someone saying &quot;I feel like I try hard to achieve but maybe I could do more, let&#039;s discuss how I could reach my full potential&quot; or something along those lines? Because in life nobody can ever rest on their laurels because then you stand still as a human being. It&#039;s quite obvious that some people here forget this and that they think just buy buying shit on SR, using BTC and talking philosophically for a few minutes a day on here makes them some sort of bona fide hardcore revolutionary anarchist and you can tell because they love to stick that term on themselves more than George Cloony likes to take credit for shit at award ceremonies in his smug fuck-face way. <br /><br />So yeah, OP, shut the fuck up and stop talking and go and do something real. Congratulations and praise are to be given by others not by oneself. <br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I wasn&#039;t even suggesting that I think I am some sort of 1337 h4x0r just because I found this place. I was just suggesting that the whole Tor and BTC thing wanes out idiots. and when I said that people here are smart, I didn&#039;t even have myself in mind. This thread was basically just me being impressed with the site&#039;s userbase after reading some posts in the philosophy and safety sections

				Bro... I don&#039;t even know where to start... Let&#039;s see.<br /><br />Entering SR is easy. Very easy. It requires that you download a program that doesn&#039;t even need to be installed. You then need to be capable of double-clicking the exe file and copypasting an address and hitting enter. That&#039;s it. The only people this procedure is too complicated for is the mentally retarded. <br /><br />This forum is not intelligent at all, and to even suggest that it is the most intelligent place on the internet is absurd. Laughable. If you are impressed with the level of intellect displayed in this forum, then you have my condolences...

They are full of condescending unhelpful replies from other people who have the very same right to be here as the next newbie.<br /><br />The only thing we need is the road and the trusted folk who run it, good vendors and security.
