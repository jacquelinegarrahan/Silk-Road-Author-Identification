				Many reasons, but for me... we spoke out against the sale of firearms- and it seems they are no longer being sold. I think it&#039;s great that the admins heard us out and took action. If only REAL GOVERNMENT was run like SR..

				As far as I&#039;m aware (and I&#039;m open to correction on this) the gun vendors themselves decided to stop selling firearms, which itself demonstrates that a self-regulated market works! Despite the potential sales and money to be made, perhaps they decided that SR stood for something bigger than them. Or perhaps they realised that there&#039;d be a lot of people who would try various scams / slander in order to get them off the site, who-knows?! Real government has a lot to learn from SR, but then if we were to self-regulate in reality, what would we need to pay outrageously expensive politicians for!

				I definitely agree with you.&nbsp; I&quot;m not sure why the guns decided to leave silk road but I can say I&#039;m glad to see them gone.&nbsp; Untraceable guns is always a bad thing in my opinion and can promote violence in more cases upon others more than defense among those that require it.&nbsp; This is especially the case amongst US, EU and AU, (amongst other) jurisdictions. I&#039;m sorry if EU laws are strict but firearms are meant for those who have undergone proper training and have proven they can handle such weapons.&nbsp; Same as driving a car.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want to rant, it&#039;s just good to see silk road cleared of them (as of now).
