				Topic.&nbsp; Some vendors are asking for track &amp; trace (or similar services) which require the recipient to sign.&nbsp; If someone is expecting to have to sign for a package of an illicit substance how much risk are they putting themselves at?<br /><br />Technically couldn&#039;t anyone send you a package with drugs in it and require a signature?&nbsp; Would this defense be taken seriously in court?

				This has been discussed, but it comes down to a.) what can the LEO prove, and b.) how much shit do you really want to have to deal with?<br /><br />As to b.), if you want to be safe, just find another vendor who doesn&#039;t require signature.<br /><br />As for a.), if you sign for a package, and are immediately arrested, what can they charge you with?&nbsp; Unless they can prove you were expecting the pakage (which is usually impossible), then they can only charge you for possession once you open the package, which means the conents are in your posession.&nbsp; If you wait to open the package, or if you write &quot;Return to Sender&quot; on the package, then there will be no evidence that the contents of the package are in your posession.&nbsp; Without that evidence, there is no proof that you ordered the contents, or even that you know the sender (or that the sender even is even a real person).&nbsp; If they try to bust you in this situation, simply deny any knowledge, and your good.&nbsp; Do not let them search you, as they will only be looking for evidence to use against you for receiving the package (such as evidence of SR on your electronic devices), plus it&#039;s not within their rights (in the USA).<br /><br />But again, back to the b.) point, just err on the side of caution and avoid having to sign if you don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; There are a ton of options on SR.

				Avoid signing if at all possible. Really the only time you should consider getting something you need to sign for is if you&#039;re buying a biiiiiig bulk order. A lot of vendors that sell big will require tracking/signatures

				They can search your residence if you sign for it and its a cd. There is a sticky thread by an ex usps worker who said the warrants were executed soon as the person signed. If they didn&#039;t sign, no bust. So if you sign even if you beat the charge on the package, they will bust you for what you have in your home and if you have some of the same thing you got in the package that would be evidence you were ordering it.

				I would rather lose the entire shipment than sign. Signing is just one more nail in your eventual coffin, if anything should happen.<br /><br />Reduce risk to the utmost minimum! You want to use Silk Road many times in the future, don&#039;t you? Then find sellers who don&#039;t put in you through unnecessary risks.<br /><br />However, I understand that maybe it&#039;s important for some people to see where their package is. Personally, I think this is a wonderful time to say: &quot;Curiosity killed the cat&quot;.

				Any vendor who sends packages with a method that requires customer&#039;s signature is a despicable louse and a fool, and should be run outta town (or at least blacklisted by any intelligent buyer).<br /><br />Stay away from&#039;em!<br /><br />goblin

				&gt; the warrants were executed soon as the person signed. If they didn&#039;t sign, no bust.<br /><br />this is crucial knowledge. assuming you live in the us, the only feasible way to get busted as a buyer is through acknowledgement that you sent for the package(s) in question. even if you are questioned by the police, denying that you sent for any packages addressed to you still gives you enough reasonable doubt to protect you from any warrants. <br /><br />as always, though, YMMV.

				Let&#039;s be honest here. I do not think you have much to worry about. The cops have no way of knowing that you ordered drugs, otherwise nobody would buy from this site. Even if they did, do they really care about some guy getting a few hits of acid? I think they would care much more about the vendors.

				You&#039;re right about LE priorities, but would YOU risk it? Let&#039;s assume YOU get asked to sign. Would you search for another vendor or happily sign for your drugs at the post office?

				Fucking buying drugs and paranoid people go hand in hand... Have you guys ever heard of plausible dependability??? As long as you deny that you ordered the package and hold to that story you can&#039;t get in trouble. A friend of mine got a ounce of MDMA in the mail (not from a SR vendor, from a friend) and he signed the package. Two hours later the cops came to the door with a warrant for his arrest and he went calmly, simply stating that he wanted to speak to a lawyer before he made any comments to them. Low and behold 24 hours later he was let out with no charges. Yeah, the cops kept the ounce of MDMA of course, but after talking to his family lawyer he realized that all he had to do was deny all the accusations, they held him for the 24 hour maximum and was forced to let him go.

				I find that info of exactly ZERO help (in terms of settling anyone&#039;s worries). I am not impressed one bit that after 24 hours of arrest time he got home. I would rather AVOID being arrested, and I think this stands true for anybody here. Once you get arrested even once, you start looking over your shoulder, you might have trouble finding employment and so on and so forth.<br /><br />I think it is risky to mock law enforcement and taking them like they&#039;re a bunch of kids or idiots and you can laugh in their face. It&#039;s a dangerous and arrogant attitude which will be one&#039;s demise. I respect LE and I am afraid of it. I will do everything in my power to stay as far away from them as possible, minimizing the risk as much as possible.
