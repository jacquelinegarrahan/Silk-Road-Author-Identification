				Ugh, just because you are unable to access the road for a couple hours does not mean it&#039;s a &#039;blackout&#039; I&#039;m sure there are times that DPR and his crew have to take the site down stealthily for reasons they can&#039;t openly discuss for security purposes.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget how many people there are out there that would love to take this site down and how much effort DPR has to put into keeping it running.

The make millions!!<br />Making that kind of money or is by taking risks, or smart business. In this case probably both.<br />SR...okay but there are at least a couple more doing the same. Just take Black Marker Reloaded, Farmers Market.<br />Don&#039;t understand me wrong, I love SR.... have a lot of customers and log in every day at round 8am and stay there till bedtime..<br />The problem is that when you use this site specially as a vendor (the important part here !!) you need to have quality. Quality to be able to provide your customers the service SR !!! want you so much to give!!!<br />Of course, like I said before something can go wrong. A week no SR because of a serious reason...NO PROBLEM !!<br />But, just during the week so to speak it should work. One time not able to log in ....understandable two times....mnnn but F 30 !!! times is a bit odd don&#039;t you say.<br />You can ! change this but you need to invest. Sure SR is grown very fast...so ? Also mean you earned a lot !<br />When you earn a lot and want to keep growing you need to invest. <br />Don&#039;t come now with all the bla bla stories. If you don&#039;t invest it means that you don&#039;t give a shit, the junkies will buy even if it cost half a day to login...same as the vendors who want to make money<br />When you have enough you can sell it.<br />There was a rumor that it was already the case, no idea, don&#039;t care. Could be a reason for all this though.<br />Again, as a vendor I ask do something to improve this. Not doing so you are fucking us all with a big grin on your face !!!<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				For God&#039;s sake, people... look, this is not a normal internet site with a server that you get efficiently routed to like google.com or something.&nbsp; This is a hidden Tor service.&nbsp; That means you go through several computers on the way there, each of which have their own standard routing procedure -- fuck, how to put this...<br /><br />It&#039;s like connecting to Google.com, then using THAT connection to connect to Yahoo.com, then using THAT connection to connect to askjeeves.com, then using THAT connection to connect to aol.com, and then linking through all of those encrypted connections to interact with aol.com.&nbsp; If any of them are down, then the site will appear to be down.<br /><br />Other people can get to SR (which is aol.com in my example)?&nbsp; Then the site ain&#039;t down.&nbsp; Your Tor program is just having trouble finding a route to it.&nbsp; The SR server could be a billion dollar behemoth that could calculate more numbers in a nanosecond than Data from Star Trek -- if one of the links inbetween sucks, the site will appear to be fucking slow as molasses.<br /><br />Make sense?&nbsp; As for the &quot;bad login,&quot; for some reason, I get it precisely once every single time.&nbsp; No matter what.&nbsp; And only once.&nbsp; That&#039;s all I can say about it.

Then just bookmark it. If you have logged in in the last hour you&#039;ll notice it looks different. It should be in igcognito mode (no pictures, and camel removed). This is because of the image hack DPR just cited. The website should be reset to its original settings before too long.

				lol @ SS. Can really tell who&#039;s high and who&#039;s not by the strange posts. <br /><br />Last &quot;replay says not to use onion?&quot; was me lol. Onion.to logs user data, Tor doesn&#039;t. That simple. If you are loading Onion.to via clearnet you are not anonymous. If you are loading Onion.to via Tor, there&#039;s even less point, as it will be just as slow but still not anonymous as user info is archived. And if you are loading Onion.to via clearnet via wikipedia.....weeeeeeellllllll...................... where do I even start?<br /><br />What happened to your account has been reported by someone else on SR already, so God knows how many this lowlife has affected. From now on, never drill down from Wikipedia, Hidden Wiki, Onion.net (even on Tor), or clearnet (surface web).
