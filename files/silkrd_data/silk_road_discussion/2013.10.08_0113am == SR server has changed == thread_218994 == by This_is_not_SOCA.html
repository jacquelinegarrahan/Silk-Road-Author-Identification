				At some point between Thursday and today it looks like the seized silkroad server has changed or been rebuilt. (edit update: probably on sunday morning EST)<br /><br />The server was configured with UTC/GMT - now it is is configured UTC-1 hours.<br /><br />Also previously it was possible to cause the server to return the Silkroad banner using a malformed query with a carriage return in such as:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/someoldbollocks/%0a/ <br />The above request would generate a 404 and return the camel and the SR header. Now that same request returns a bog standard nginx 404 and the remnants of the SR content that were on the server are no longer accessible.<br /><br />Exciting? no; but I thought it was worth mentioning - I was very surprised last week that whoever seized it didn&#039;t just blank the server and roll out a fresh one to display the seizure notice - i mean if you are the FBI would you feel comfortable essentially just replacing the front page of a web server you had seized, tweaking the nginx config and still leaving the system accessible?....<br />

				If u can access to a&quot;SR error script&quot; (from the main site) via the forum, doesn&#039;t mean both are hosted <br /><br />on same server ?<br /><br />give me your advice MarcelKetman, but respect mine.<br />

				No.&nbsp; It just means the same error page is on both machines.&nbsp; Have you ever copied files from one machine to another one?

				No guys, nothing is on the same server. I promise. All that page means is there is:<br />1. the same error page between the 2 servers as stated above, since custom errors are configured by pointing the server to throw the same page.<br />2. It is redirecting across servers on error which is very likely.<br />3. Nothing, that page means nothing! It is not set up the same as SR, does not use the same page headers as SR, and uses in-line styles unlike SR, SR was all external styles. It&#039;s just an error page as many others have stated.
