				Whilst the Road is down let&#039;s have a discussion of your RL interactions with people who know of SR or have used it.<br />I recently moved into halls and on my first day (over a fattie) my flatmate brought up the Road and we had a good discussion on it. I haven&#039;t brought it up with anyone since then, for obvious reasons. However a few days ago I was chilling and smoking with some friends and a few people I kind of knew and someone brought it up. Out of 7 people 4 had heard of it, 2 knew people who had ordered off it and 1 had ordered as well. <br />Obviously being a student this kind of thing is more common than most with my age range but I was still surprised at how much people knew about ordering drugs online, even if they didn&#039;t know SR and bitcoins by name.<br /><br />Your experiences? I know we&#039;ve had this discussion of popularity a few times before but this is more when you didn&#039;t expect the Road to come up. I&#039;m using a new account as I don&#039;t want the information in this thread to tie with my other account :)

				QUIT TELLING PEOPLE<br /><br />Jk. I found out about SR just over a weeks ago and placed my first order Thursday. I asked the one person i know that i thought might know about it and they did not. So I left it at that and didn&#039;t go into it. <br /><br />My sig-o knows now, too, but other than that I don&#039;t plan on telling anyone else for a long time.

				I&#039;m from Germany and SR/TOR/BTC have no media attention here. One day one of my awesome nerd buddies told me about TOR and at that point it was pretty much impossible for me to not find SR and BMR. After that I told all my druggie and stoner friends about it. So yeah... I don&#039;t know anyone who found out about SR independently.

				100% of the people i hangout with do drugs,&nbsp; and i&#039;d say 80% have dealt in a significant sense, and about 20% are still dealing in a significant sense&nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp; i know of one person who has mentioned it to me who has ordered from there,&nbsp; another person (who is actually a close friend)&nbsp; is too paranoid to order but who knew about it, and a third whom i don&#039;t talk to anymore but i HIGHLY suspect he does considering drugs he has offered me ahve been ones such as MDA and 4-aco-dmt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;even though he is quite the recluse ( seems a bit paranoic but was chill when i hungout with him the few times i did)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />yep so 3 people&nbsp; <br /><br />my thoughts are that it will only get more and more public and the drugs such as 2c-x&nbsp; and 25i&nbsp; etc&nbsp; will become common and dirt cheap&nbsp; &nbsp; locally.&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;m collecting while its still a fresh market so&nbsp; i can pay for college :)&nbsp;

I found out about it myself from a drug forum Only a few weeks ago :) I&#039;m not planning on telling anyone I know tbh.

				As a vendor, I don&#039;t tell anybody about SR...not even my closest friends. I discovered it on my own and once I saw the prices of Weed and knew I could make money as a vendor I knew to keep my mouth shut. <br /><br />As a buyer, I guess there is no harm in telling people, at least, not any more harm than telling them you do A, B, C, etc drugs. The way SR is structured, the Feds aren&#039;t able to attack vendors using buyers accounts (unless a vendor is stupid enough to get really friendly with a buyer and exchange real life info). <br /><br />I have never heard anybody mention SR at a party or social setting. Honestly, between Tor, bitcoins, and PGP encryption I&#039;d be really surprised to hear somebody mention they use SR. Most people only use the computer for facebook and youtube =P

				So far I have only one friend that knows about it, though he has never purchased from SR. Due to the extreme lack of MDMA &amp; psychedelics in my area and within my network of friends, I doubt anyone else knows or bothers making purchasing. I don&#039;t plan on ever revealing my source :)

				I can&#039;t say for certain but i don&#039;t think alot of people near me know about it. I go out now and then and see everyone getting shitfaced drunk and frankly i feel sorry for them. Sometimes when i&#039;m out i&#039;ll think of Silky and smile to myself because i can mix it up. Some bud one week, resin the next, LSD every few months and the odd E. To an uneducated person that might seem unhealthy but i feel far more comfortable in my own skin now than when i was limited to alcohol (which i now abstain from completely). Discovering Silk Road has been huge in a spiritual sense for me. I am able to make Cannabis tinctures with the strains i want which i use for a long-standing lower back problem and my first LSD trip (courtesy of Premium Dutch) was a landmark event in my life which i used to quit the booze for good (it&#039;s been 5 months nearly - so far so good). Since discovering Silk Road i&#039;ve started two paid jobs and one volunteer placement and i know for a fact my circumstances wouldn&#039;t have improved without Silk Road. That might seem a contradiction given that there are so many harmful substances but its the honest truth for me. I hope that when people decide to discuss the Road they try and promote responsible use too. I have not gained financially from SR in any way but it has helped me in other ways so much that i can only consider it a privilege to have access to.

				everytime someone has asked me about the road i have told them ( dont do it its all scams ) or i told them its just not worth it its a setup, because the more noobs we get on here and the more idiots trying to figure out this (which isnt rocket science anyway) causes more problems. regardless i just try and keep away as many people as i can from knowing about it in my area so my team can come up and tax the f u c k out of everyone like we have been doing.<br /><br />im sure the road is pretty content with the members it has right now anyway? wonder if theyve ever thought about only allowing vendors sign up and no more buyers? but that would be messed up if someone lost their accounts that are solid buyers and honest and legit. either way the less people that know = the better.

				Believe it or not I was outside a club recently getting high and met three other guys getting high too. They asked me where I got my bud and I told them online, and straightaway the guy knew I meant Silk Road, and he knew all about Bitcoins, Tor, etc - although he&#039;d never ordered himself. I was way surprised to randomly bump into a fellow user.<br /><br />And in my circle of friends, plenty of people know. Good, reliable drugs are scarce round these parts, so whenever you get your hands on some decent MDMA or an on-weight weed deal, everyone clamours to learn about your source. I must&#039;ve explained SR to a good 10 - 15 people, although out of all of those I&#039;d wager only one or two will actually ever wind up ordering anything.

				No one knows. I mentioned it one time to someone but they were really scared. I told them it is almost the same risk as buying from an undercover. It is too complicated for the people around here. Funny thing is, I was reading msn, and got interested in that Miami causeway killer thing, clicked on a Luka Rocco Magnotta article- Which led to me being a weirdo and wanting to find out more, reading about the deep web (which wasn&#039;t linked to that video), then reading about Silk Road. I was super excited and researched and lurked forever before buying anything. I really don&#039;t want to help anyone get to it. I did it somehow, they can somehow.

				Funnily enough, I found out about SR like many other users, which was through the media. I was at the shops, waiting for my half chicken and chips at the time and it was being broadcast on the news on their TV. I almost ran home to check it out and was absolutely amazed when it existed.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t met anyone IRL that has actually used it and it took me about 3 months of reading and wondering whether or not it was worth it to finally take the plunge. <br /><br />I bit the bullet one day and just ordered some domestic bud, yada yada yada, nowadays I keep a very watchful eye on the mail.

I was expecting a whole shit load of Indian internet pharmacies but instead I found a few articles from very reputable sources about this underground market called the &quot;Silk Road&quot;.....and so it began. I really view it as a revolution because now I&#039;ve got access to just about anything and have the personal restraint not to get certain things. I made a tiny order with decent hopes and sure enough when it showed up I felt like I was in the future.<br /><br />Most people around where I am know about SR by word of mouth but only 2 out of the dozens that have heard of it actually put forth the effort to use it. I know a few that are able to access the site via tor but the payment is where most people just give up. Bitcoin&#039;s are tricky to initially figure out how to deposit/transfer but once you get the hang of it the whole process is really fast and the anonymity they offer well worth the minor inconvenience.<br /><br />*Thanks to everyone who helped the SR get started, if I have to deal with people like the dealer I describe below again I&#039;ll probably get shot when I school them on how ignorant they are.<br /><br />The problem with the &quot;dealers&quot; I knew is that they had the intelligence level of a doorknob. I knew one guy that claimed Oxycodone is the pharmaceutical form of Heroin and that he would NEVER do it, needless to he then admitted to taking 5 Percocet all at once the previous night. So not only did he take 25mg of Oxycodone but he threw enough APAP in the mix to give his liver a nice exercise, it was funny because he thought a Percocet contained Percocet. How stupid do you have to be I mean seriously!<br /><br />I wonder has anyone on this forum ever known a dealer that ACTUALLY knew their shit?<br />

				My roommate knows about it only because I wanted to keep him in the loop about what I was ordering and why Quarter Pounds of weed were showing up at the door with my name on it.. Other than that no one in my area.. that I know of.. are using it or have any idea that such a site exists.. I had heard about the road multiple times through other clearnet sites like the shroomery and bluelight but never tried to attempt to look for it until I saw a media post about kids in canada ordering pounds of weed and sheets upon sheets of lsd and I was like &quot;well fuck, if they can do it so can I&quot; then I went on the search for the road and read all kinds of info for about a week before ordering a small sample of green to test the waters and haven&#039;t looked back..&nbsp; I will never tell another sole about this site as I want to keep my source a secret and my market low of competition..

				None. None whatsoever. Which is great for me, because I get superb drugs for cheap, and I can sell them to people who wish to purchase said superb drugs at a &quot;regular&quot; price, which makes me quite a lot of pocket cash. If people around here knew about it, then they&#039;d just use it themselves. Not to mention the widespread popularity of this site may cause problems.

				I do have one friend IRL who uses SR as much as I do, but we live in different states so he isn&#039;t in my area. I live in a hick town so I doubt anyone around me is using SR.

				Is the recent downtime an indication that we need to stop spreading the word? Obviously you can&#039;t stop it growing completely like. <br /><br />I&#039;ve one friend who knows i use SR and another that i get things online. When i first discovered this place i was like a kid in a sweet shop, fucking browsing through nearly every page of drugs. I thought the war on drugs was hilariously futile anyway but when i realized Royal Mail were delivering every class of drug going to peoples doorsteps i thought it was fucking brilliant! Royal Mail ( the UK&#039;s main postal service) is government owned which makes it even funnier. The sight of the postman walking down the road towards my drop-off gaff is absolutely beautiful :D

				I&#039;m in the UK, we do love our drugs. I know a few who have heard of it, but haven&#039;t ordered, I haven&#039;t mentioned I do simply because I don&#039;t want people asking me to order for them, can&#039;t be bothered going down that road, no pun intended. <br /><br />If I go to a rave EVERYONE has heard of SR, a lot of the people are probably taking products bought on here.

				I came across 1 person while getting a tattoo before, they brought it up (a chick), I said I knew about it, but didnt say if I ever used it, she spewed out how much H and meth she got on there ...gave me her username ...i never contacted her or have seen her ever again....<br />I do not think many in my area would talk about it either if they were smart.

				I can&#039;t even remember quite where I first read about SR but before I knew it I was devouring the famous &#039;How-To&#039; article, then lurking and reading everything within the forums. Took a couple of months to figure it all out but once I did I realised it was pretty damn easy despite how it all initally looks from the outside.<br /><br />My problem is that I can now only get weed through two guys and they aren&#039;t dealers they just happen to know one or two. Some of those dealers are what most would consider as chavs and will often do shitty deals or try to rip you off. Much more importantly the only things you can seem to get in my area are weed and coke but I&#039;ve wanted to try psychedelics for a long time and SR was my only real chance.<br /><br />I have one friend whos heard of it, hes gay and very much into the drug culture that comes with the scene but hes too paranoid to use it and he doesn&#039;t know anyone who does. <br />In some situations I&#039;ve had close friends ask me where I got something and I&#039;ll just say online. They&#039;re all amazed and want to know all the details so I give them a vague rundown of how you order online and its sent to your home, it&#039;s at this point everyone reacts in the same way and starts to bristle in the chair and say things like &quot;Thats sound pretty dangerous to me&quot;, &quot;I&#039;d never do that you&#039;re bound to get caught&quot; or the best is from the know it alls &quot;That&#039;d never even work because blah, blah, blah&quot;.<br />It doesn&#039;t take much info for them to either get freaked out and panic about the idea, become hugely confused by the idea of bitcoins or try to give me a lecture on how it won&#039;t work (despite me mentioning that it already has, multiple times).<br /><br />Most people look for problems in nearly all areas of their lives as they can provide a nice excuse not to do something and that seems to go double for SR. One of the most frequent things people bring up is &quot;You don&#039;t know the seller, they could be sending anything, like poison!&quot;. The idea of meeting a total stranger in person, in a fairly dodgy situation with no info about them or trustworthy feedback on the product, to buy something with full knowledge you will never see them again or even have a way to contact them is preferable to most people than buying on SR where there is lots of detailed feedback, trusted sellers and clear communication with impartial admin and the resolution process. The general attitude will never make sense to me and it&#039;s also why I think SR will not get that much bigger. Most people will never have the nerve, patience or intelligence to use it.

				None of my friends and acquaintances knows about SR and I will surely not mention it to anyone! I believe, it is like in RL: the more people know about this type of thing, the riskier it gets for everybody!&nbsp; :D

				I found out about it on my own, really not hard considering how there are YouTube tutorials on how to get to the Road (herpderp), told one of my friends about it but said it sounded &quot;way to risky, I would never order from there&quot; :P Honestly, I don&#039;t know of anyone in my area who knows about the SR.
