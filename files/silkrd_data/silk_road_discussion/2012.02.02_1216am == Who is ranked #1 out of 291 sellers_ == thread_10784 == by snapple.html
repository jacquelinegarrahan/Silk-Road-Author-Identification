				From my guess, pharmville<br /><br />for some reason their profile is the only one which doesn&#039;t show a rank (and they move a LOT of product).<br /><br />Tetravort used to be #2, not sure where he is now.

				I am actually EXTREMELY curious about this as well - but if I were to take a guess, I would have to agree with Purified and say Pharmville. they seem to have their shit together to the max. I am also curious to what their total order count is - it seems venders top out at 500+. it would be neat to find out how many orders from venders like Pharmville have actually processed. quite interesting - they are obviously VERY good at what they do

Its good enough to know that a seller has completed enough transactions and has been selling long enough to be respected and trusted. SR should display info about sellers differently, especially the top sellers. I think the old method of showing 250+ sales is good. The more sales that the seller has done the more interest that LE would have in them. <br />I understand that your probably just curious and not ill intentioned but vendor sales are a private issue. Its very important that SR does everything they can to minimize LE interest in sellers, especially the top sellers. One way to do this is by prevent buyers from viewing the full amount of sales that vendors have. Top vendors have clearly earned thier reputations therefore buyers do not need to know the exact number of sales. Capping the sales limit that buyers are able to see should be back at 250+ Why do customers need to know the vendor has done 500+ sales
