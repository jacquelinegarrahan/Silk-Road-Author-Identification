				I&#039;m a 50 year old lady who&#039;s dying of small cell cancer. I moved to a new state to spend the last few months of my life near my son who&#039;s away at college. Unfortunately, I&#039;ve had a hard time getting the same amount of medicine as I was in California.<br /><br />My son found this website for me. I thought it was the greatest thing. I had a hard time getting coins on here though. I&#039;m not computer savvy at all. But I found user &#039;TwoMuch&#039; who&#039;s ad said money in minutes. I sent him $800 in Moneypaks, which was almost my whole disability check, and he was supposed to send me coins so that I can purchase my medicine. I thought that it would be fine because he had good reviews. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been literally begging him, sending him message after message, and he has not sent me the coins. He even knew my condition ahead of time.<br /><br />I then went on the forum, and saw that he&#039;s a &#039;selective scammer&#039;. He took the money off my cards already, and has the money in his account.<br /><br />Now, not only am I not going to be able to get out of bed in the morning, but now I&#039;m out the only money that I had to get my medicine from someone else. Small cell cancer is a very rapidly advancing cancer, and I only have a few months to live. It&#039;s very painful. Opana and Oxycodone are the only medicines that makes my life tolerable.<br /><br />My son helped take the screen shots for me below when he got home last night to show TwoMuch and my discussion:<br /><br />http://i49.tinypic.com/b6yo9s.jpg<br />http://i48.tinypic.com/2q0830i.jpg<br /><br />PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have some heart, and help me get my money back for me.

				TwoMuch is a scammer that has been written about on these forums. That&#039;s fucked up. My mom died from cancer 5 years ago. Sadly he has less of a fucking heart than most people and shame will not move him to refund anything. There are many different ways to go about getting bitcoins that don&#039;t involve scamming shitheads like him.

				unfortunately there is not much people can do here to help you<br />one of the reason is you sent money to a user(not a vendor)<br />to be honest the whole story seems a bit fishy<br /><br />why would you buy bitcoin from a user without using escrow?<br />you said he has good review?i dont get this <br />if he aint a seller he shouldnt have any review <br /><br />also I understand that cancer is terrible<br />but you dont need to say that If good people can help they ll help no matter what<br /><br />next time if you buy bitcoin use a legit source with a good rep&nbsp; <br />thats all i can say

				A little update:<br /><br />The vendor I was going to purchase from sent &#039;TwoMuch&#039; a message and then sent me this showing what was said: <br /><br />He sent this...<br /><br />&quot;Dude, enough of your tough guy on the internet shit. I talked to the lady for hours earlier. She&#039;s very nice and seriously dying of cancer. Did you look up her form of cancer? She&#039;s lucky if she has 8 months left, and needs her meds. You have her a complete mess.<br /><br />If there really is a god, you want that on your resume when you meet him?<br /><br />Don&#039;t be a piece of shit for once in your life. There are plenty of junkies and other people to rob on here. If it was someone like that I wouldn&#039;t be wasting my time right now. I can sell pills to plenty of other people. I don&#039;t need her cash. But what you did to her really isn&#039;t right bro. My aunt died of cancer, and if something like this happened to her right before she died, I&#039;d hunt the motherfucker down. That&#039;s why I&#039;m willing to use every connection that I have here and go all the way with this.&quot;<br /><br />TwoMuch responded with...<br /><br />&quot;Lol, well how about you not be a piece of shit and send her meds. Or tell her to go the doctors and get it If I can get them no problem she can to, I didnt say anything to her/reply. You make yourself sound even worse every connecton give her damn pills i only have 2 blues.. Anyways From this Point I will disregard all messages. I don&#039;t have time for this bull shit, Lol Your the one that started the tough guy stuff. If she is seriously dying might as well feed her 20pills at once so she can O.D. and get it over with instead of a slow deacying death.&quot;

				I&#039;m sorry this happened to you.&nbsp; The vendor has been reported multiple times, but I think SR Support is currently just overwhelmed so things are moving slowly.&nbsp; <br /><br />In any case, as with most scams, there&#039;s not much anyone can do to help you get the money back.<br /><br />Also, please don&#039;t take it personally that people here are skeptical -- we have seen many people come here, claim they had cancer, ask for bitcoins/money, and then announce that they scammed everyone and never had cancer.<br /><br />So, we&#039;re a skeptical bunch, but for good reason.<br /><br />Nonetheless, you&#039;re not asking for anything other than your money back from the vendor, and that is understandable.&nbsp; I wish that there was more we could do, but scammers are not often swayed by sympathy or empathy.&nbsp; :(

				I do have a question though - if you are this sick, why isn&#039;t your doctor prescribing you enough medication?&nbsp; You mentioned in your other thread that when you lived in CA it was already prescribed for you, so you&#039;ve had a prescription for it in the past.&nbsp; <br /><br />What is your current doctor&#039;s reasoning for not prescribing?&nbsp;

When you&#039;re starting a thread, check the little indicator light somewhere around your keyboard.

Then everyone who sees, reads, and/or replays to your topic won&#039;t get FUCKING AGGRAVATED, and you&#039;re much more likely to get the sympathy you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />Yes folks, cantharidin here - I&#039;d rather berate a dying cancer patient than have to look at all-caps...

				First off, if this is real, then two things. <br /><br />One, 50 years old with cancer and you&#039;re down here with us? You have just obliterated every single stereotype of old people knowing nothing about tech. Well done.<br /><br />Second, I looked through your post history and noticed that your only posts were 50 spam posts and then the posts on this thread. Did you really have ZERO questions? It makes me really sad to see someone who admits they are a noob and had a horrible experience, and yet it looks like the only reason they made a forum account was to lodge a complaint about the experience. The forum is not here just to rat out vendors, it is here so you can learn and ask questions. <br /><br />Also, 800$? Were you looking at grabbing a QP straight off? Talk about jumping right in...<br /><br />You have to keep in mind, this is an ANONYMOUS, ILLEGAL market. You can&#039;t treat like the local pharmacy, or wherever you get meds. There are people here who will screw you over without giving a single shit about you. There are also some really awesome people who pride themselves on having a flawless reputation. <br /><br />Really, it looks to me like you essentially made three errors:<br /><br />You did not do your research.<br />You bit off WAY more than a noob should. <br />You trusted someone. <br /><br />If you decide to try again, I hope you learned from this experience and that you approach your next attempt with more caution. If you have any questions, you can message me, one of the mods, or any of the other veterans. <br /><br />Explore the forums. Talk to people. Get a feel for the place. And when you are ready, go for it again. <br /><br />Good luck!

				Oh, and to the person saying that this is an illegal drug place, DUH! I might be sick, but I&#039;m not an old crud! In my good days I could hang with all of you young studs! LOL! I&#039;ve bought drugs before &quot;on the street&quot; (how do you think I got my Opana&#039;s in California?), I&#039;ve smoked pot plenty of times before, did a little coke when I was younger, experimented with acid (that wasn&#039;t for me), etc...Haven&#039;t you heard about California Girls before? ;) But blatantly getting robbed by someone with great reviews I didn&#039;t expect.

Morphine is just two or three days post-surgery. In my country at least, the medical system is very cautious...<br /><br />That being said, I thought that every western country would give dying patients some pills to alliviate the pain, you know, our western concept of human dignity...

				if you can&#039;t get more meds, make do with what you can. sniff the opiates rather than swallow them, keeping tolerance down (smaller dosage) and intensity up. As it&#039;s been said, you will not get your money back. If you are in pain, and you are not already sniffing your pills, I would suggest that is your best option. it sounds like you are taking a lot, and no doubt have a lot of tolerance, so you need to get the most out of the drug with your ROA. thats the best short term advice I can give

				A quick glance in my copy of Vitamin C and Cancer reveals numberous case reports of patients with incurable metastatic lung cancer whose condition was reversed by the use of Vitamin C, usually around 10g a day. Cancer is both caused by and produces an ascorbate deficiency, which (among many other things) promotes its metastasis by disrupting the formation of connective tissue.<br />If you can get your doctor on board that would be ideal (or get a new doctor), but I strongly advise you start supplementing with ascorbate; start at 500mg a day, add 500mg or so each day until you reach 10g a day. It may seem like a lot, but people have taken 100+g daily without ill effects, and humans would be consuming somewhere from 5 to 15 grams daily eating our &#039;ancestral&#039; mainly-fruit diet.<br /><br />&nbsp;As scout noted, cannabis oil is effective at treating a wide range of cancers, with very few adverse effects. It&#039;s expensive, though, while vitamin C tablets cost pennies per gram, and the powder is even cheaper. The best forms to use are sodium and magnesium ascorbate.<br />Good luck!

				Hey i just wanted to say that really sucks what happened to you, it&#039;s never nice when someone gets ripped off especially when you are already having a hard time in life... my advice would be only purchase bitcoins from reputable companies by doing direct bank deposits in cash, you will find these services easily with a google search and not have to worry about being scammed.<br /><br />Best of luck to you and always remember death is only the beginning of a new experience.<br /><br />Much love and respect to all beings.<br /><br />

				Can I recruit you for a spin-off of the television series Breaking Bad?<br /><br />But seriously this is a shitty situation if OP is legit. I am truly sorry to see that.<br /><br />I would recommend Butane Hash Oil as it is the true pain reliever!<br /><br />Just curious, but that&#039;s .5 G&#039;s a day over a full eight month period...<br /><br />That&#039;s almost a little much daily for even myself, not that I can&#039;t smoke more or haven&#039;t before, I just thank any more than that is almost an addiction.<br /><br />That was a lot of buds for a cancer patient to be ingesting daily.

				Sorry to everyone for not checking in until today. I ran out of medicine yesterday afternoon and really started to struggle. Luckily the vendor I was going to purchase from on here was very nice, wouldn&#039;t take no for an answer even after I refused, and sent me a few pills to hold me over for a couple of days and they arrived this morning. At least they give me a few more days to figure out what I&#039;m going to do with a somewhat clear head. I apologize in advance if I&#039;m a little out of it today, I&#039;m seriously running on 2 hours of sleep, pain medicine and 3 cups of coffee. I&#039;m also not in the greatest of all moods and quite upset after speaking to SR Support...<br /><br />I do however honestly want to send a heartfilled thank you to everyone for your well wishes. If for nothing else, it helps reassure my faith in humanity, which can be put into question during events in one&#039;s life like this. Your kindness means more to me than you know.<br /><br /><br />A little update: <br /><br />Unfortunately, the people who said I wouldn&#039;t get my money back were right. To an outsider it seems that so many people scam on here because nothing is done. On places like eBay or Amazon, one or two scam attempts and the person is removed. They also stand behind their customers and refund them if an issue like this arises and they go all out to prosecute the guilty party. I realize not all of that can be done here because of the anonymous thing and the nature of the business, but as a victim I truly feel that more should be done by Silk Road staff. Also to the people that kept saying I was screwed, that&#039;s another reason why people get away with this shit. Because other people hear that and just give up. I didn&#039;t. And at least I can hold my head high knowing that &quot;TwoMuch&quot; is unable to scam anyone else in the near future. <br /><br />Anyways, even though some of you said I wouldn&#039;t get my money back, I had faith because a couple of vendors told me to keep up my fight and stay positive. They also sent me a few links where the scammer had the coins removed from his account and the people who were robbed were reimbursed. That didn&#039;t happen in my case though. <br /><br />SR Support said...<br /><br />&quot;I am very sorry about what happened, but there is no way I can recover your money.&quot;<br /><br />To which I replied...<br /><br />&quot;Why can&#039;t you take the money out of his account and refund me? You can look through my private messages and his private messages to clearly see that he robbed me. Obviously you had to investigate enough to see that he did, otherwise you wouldn&#039;t have banned him for no reason, right?. How can you let a new customer on your site lose all of that money and not stand behind it? Please help!&quot; <br /><br />Support&#039;s response was...<br /><br />&quot;There is no money on his account.<br /><br />&quot;We make it very clear in the wiki when you do transactions outside of escrow you do so at your own risk. You shouldn&#039;t be spending that kind of money on this site if you haven&#039;t even read the Buyer&#039;s Guide.&quot;<br /><br />And my last response to them was...<br /><br />&quot;You realize that my medicine is $35/pill right? How much do you think that actually buys me? 20 pills to be exact with shipping. Yes, it&#039;s a lot of money. In terms of medicine, not that much at all. It doesn&#039;t even get me through the month. I wish it was cheaper but I don&#039;t set the prices.<br /><br />And I will say, for a new person you guys do need to make the guidelines on here clearer, especially if you&#039;re not going to stand behind your customers when they get robbed which is a shame. I didn&#039;t find the wiki and the forums until after I got robbed. And all the info I found to use this site were through outside sites. I know from looking through the forum that I&#039;m not the only person with that complaint. Not everyone is a computer wiz.&quot;<br /><br />I still can&#039;t believe that this whole thing happened to me. The past few days have been very surreal and an emotional roller coaster. It&#039;s easy to make comments and say nasty things like I was stupid or whatever when you&#039;re not in this situation, but when it&#039;s all happening to you, it&#039;s very taxing and stressful.

Cancer is both caused by and produces an ascorbate deficiency, which (among many other things) promotes its metastasis by disrupting the formation of connective tissue.<br />If you can get your doctor on board that would be ideal (or get a new doctor), but I strongly advise you start supplementing with ascorbate; start at 500mg a day, add 500mg or so each day until you reach 10g a day. It may seem like a lot, but people have taken 100+g daily without ill effects, and humans would be consuming somewhere from 5 to 15 grams daily eating our &#039;ancestral&#039; mainly-fruit diet.<br /><br />&nbsp;As scout noted, cannabis oil is effective at treating a wide range of cancers, with very few adverse effects. It&#039;s expensive, though, while vitamin C tablets cost pennies per gram, and the powder is even cheaper. The best forms to use are sodium and magnesium ascorbate.<br />Good luck!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you very very much for taking the time to type this recommendation for me, I&#039;m going to look into this.

				SR can&#039;t protect people when they do transactions outside of the escrow system - I believe SR makes that abundantly clear.&nbsp; This could have been avoided by searching on the forums for the vendor, or by reading feedback left on the vendor&#039;s own profile and listings.&nbsp; The vendor has been banned.

I agree with you. On the other hand, SR also permits MP to BTC transactions that are outside the escrow system by definition. <br /><br />How about a larger bond that is only returned upon cancellation of an account in good standing for anyone wanting to do MP to BTC business? It is just so easy to take the money and run as it is currently regulated.

If you are not &quot;internet savvy&quot; then I would suggest staying off the Road. It&#039;s not for everybody. <br /><br />I do feel bad for you and I&#039;m thinkin about sending you some left over coin I had in my acct, but I like to do research before I would give anybody money on here.&nbsp; If you weren&#039;t internet savvy how would you know how to get 50 post? Doesn&#039;t make any sense to me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />50 posts.....65 posts even. That took me quite some time to get that much I remember....<br />Like it was said, from CA there must be a patients file, you get painmeds, maybe not much/enough but you get them.<br />Again, it is strange to spend 800 dollar (your disability check) on pills and leave you with no money for rent, food, whatever.<br />You move to another part of the country to be with your son who is not taken very good care of you.....to say the least<br />I said it before, my son would go above and beyond to get me my meds or money to buy them.<br />There is one other thing too.<br />Don&#039;t know if they do that in the US but in Europe as a pain treatment they cut some nerves somewhere in your neck.<br />It seems a pretty simple operation, no anesthetic (only local) because you need to tell what you feel.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />No more pain. Downside, if you hurt yourself you don;t feel it like break a toe or a burn or so.<br />

				unfortunately sociopaths just don&#039;t give a shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />@OpanaLady&nbsp; I really think you need to doctor shop.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe that if they contact your previous doctor and get your medical history that they&#039;d fail to prescribe you even something to take the edge off your pain.

				you could buy your street heroin and do little bits to just take the pain away.. it&#039;s very powerful and price is good (on the streets) compared to pharms.
