				UPDATE:&nbsp; we are making a few modifications to the way this will work, so it&#039;s taking a little longer than expected.&nbsp; Should have it up in the next couple of hours, though.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Hi everyone,<br /><br />We are making a small change to the site that we hope will make it easier for you to find what you are looking for and purchase it.&nbsp; We are now giving everyone the option of choosing their &quot;home country&quot; so that only listings that are offered there will be displayed to you.&nbsp; If you would rather not reveal where you are from, you may choose &quot;undeclared&quot; and you will see all listings still.&nbsp; Also, with this information, we will be able to include the proper shipping options for you so you don&#039;t have to purchase a separate listing for international and priority services.<br /><br />This change will go into effect in three days at 11 pm UTC on the 29th of October, but you may update your home country on your settings page at any time.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this update.&nbsp; See you around the site :)<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJOqk4VAAoJEAIiQjtnt/ol9OMH/3Wwd9Skvd13UfaNKWf2Zeyw<br />waFkPz/VF9i0nW5JpUzhHtH333CRikyMoNkAkCvRQe1HH4RiSuHDOxuE1JknkITm<br />nzFv2ndmlDGv04pM7lJtpwWIoPRHw443+hOh812I8gYF/ctrTa6j6Tw/ikLfvF7E<br />XzO8W5oKiB23UQm8w3Zg8nAbhbVFswgA4iZJ3KYRXOcKQPHjcWUs4B+8e4D3Ll1B<br />1Nol9V8QJlWBuA4lMWvNh9Z3EO34Cioprr1zgv/0nYnod6Bg22//e3EL1haXDFky<br />KSsTdUgjXr5Ux/xfmwELW/C6aiiiO2YHnl20XyAqMW1WrowWsqszcaiM4kpzRjU=<br />=HLUW<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

				Just to want to understand the changes:<br /><br />Should I drop the price of the item to its worth and add the post costs?<br />e.g.: I sell 2 x 100mg Sildenafil for 12$ with shipping, where 1.5 is domestic and 4.5 is international<br />So I drop the price to 7.5$ and add 1.5$ for domestic = 9$ and 4.5$ international = 12$.<br /><br />Questions:<br />What happens if the Letter not arrives and I give the buyer 50% refund? Will be the shipping cost added? Or does he gets 50% from the Product price?<br /><br />Problem:<br />If I put a 1.5 in it it will be rounded to 2.<br /><br />Enhancements:<br />If I ship to the EU I have different shipping costs as in the US. We in EU have 3 different prices for the World. It would be great to add 3 international shipping cost to an Item.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				So the only way is to declare a &quot;home country&quot; in your profile, if I understand correctly?<br /><br />How about the &quot;filter by country&quot; selection being temporary (i.e. not saved as a preference in a user&#039;s profile), so they can bring up all the listings then select filter by &lt;country&gt;, and the listings will be displayed accordingly until they log out. This might be desired by users who would rather not have their country of origin linked/saved to a username?

				I would use the &quot;Filter by Country&quot; feature if I had an event and needed something at short notice. Most of my purchases are located by price and quality so I dont mind where in the world the product is coming from but if I needed something quickly, this would be a useful feature.

				Nice change! Thanks SR.<br /><br />But i think it would be a better idea to standardize the countries first. Right now the Ship To/From fields are text only, maybe a dropdown list would be better. This way we can just filter by country instead of declaring our hometown. I know this will probably require all the vendors to update their listings to confirm with the correct format.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

				I think its a bad idea that people who haven&#039;t set their region con only see worldwide listings.<br /><br />Newcomers are less likely to stick around if they can&#039;t see most of the listings, and have no idea they&#039;re missing anything.&nbsp; This just makes the site harder for newcomers to use.<br /><br />As a vendor, I&#039;d like to be able to turn the filter off so i can see what other products are available to my customers, even if they don&#039;t ship to my country.&nbsp; There doesn&#039;t seem to be a way to do this.<br /><br />Surely it makes more sense not to filter any listings unless and until the member elects turns the filter on.

				undeclared should definitely incorporate all listings !<br /><br />And if you choose your country, then it should filter.<br /><br />That&#039;s the way it is in the most cases
