				Ok...I&#039;m going to start this off with a bang!!&nbsp; What follows is probably not the average &quot;trip report&quot;.&nbsp; But like AV said in the original thread, it is my story...my experience.&nbsp; It starts out pretty heavy and personal, but it ends in the most awesome of ways.&nbsp; This happened in late October, 2012.&nbsp; I purchased several grams of MDMA from Pfhandelier.&nbsp; Dosage was......???&nbsp; Enough to get me to do what I did...lol.&nbsp; Probably .3-.5 over the course of the night.&nbsp; So here goes.....please be easy on me.... :D<br /><br />HOW SILK ROAD, Pf’S MOLLY AND FANTASY FEST SET ME FREE<br /><br />I was raped as a child, at the tender young age of 11.&nbsp; Sure, I was taller than the other girls, better developed than most of my friends, and very vulnerable.&nbsp; The men lured my friend and I to their lair, with promises of beer and weed, and like lambs to the slaughter, we eagerly complied.&nbsp; Once inside, and having been amply plied with booze and god only knows what else, we realized there was a price to pay for their hospitality.&nbsp; So we paid it.&nbsp; Little did I know that I would be paying that price for the next 30 years.&nbsp; My innocence was stolen from me that night.<br /><br />The police were called after a couple of good Samaritans found my friend wandering the streets in a stupor. Needle marks were clearly found on her arm. I had managed to make it back to the safety and comfort of my middle class home.&nbsp; With the covers pulled up over my face, I had to recount all the gruesome details of the night to the nice policewoman who sat on my bed.&nbsp; I endured the taunts from the family members of the men – they would laugh at me.&nbsp; The case never made it to court.&nbsp; My parents, at the time, felt it prudent for me to not have to testify about such things in an open courtroom.&nbsp; All three of them went free.&nbsp; But I became enslaved that night.<br /><br />I acted out in so many self-destructive ways after that night.&nbsp; Even then, I was unable to fully comprehend the gravity of what had happened.&nbsp; I often wonder if I even understand today. Boy did I take revenge – on myself.&nbsp; My anger was misdirected.&nbsp; I blamed myself. I started smoking and drinking. Hard drugs by age 13.&nbsp; I ran away from my nice home on a regular basis. I just wanted to be high ALL THE TIME. And I was.&nbsp; I had no concept of self-esteem, no real sense of self. I wandered lost and lonely and scared for years.<br /><br />Slowly, over time, I managed to put together what seemed like a normal life for myself.&nbsp; I learned to live with the guilt.&nbsp; I graduated from college.&nbsp; I got a great job, bought a house, had some really great boyfriends, and just generally appeared to be doing just what I was supposed to be.&nbsp; But underneath all that normalcy, I was still haunted.&nbsp; Haunted by relentless shame, guilt, and worst of all, a deep hatred of myself.<br /><br />Flash forward 30 years.&nbsp; I was in my art studio, surfing around and generally just goofing off.&nbsp; I came upon this really interesting article on a website called Gawker.&nbsp; It really caught my attention……could there really be such a place???&nbsp; And much to my amazement, there was, but it took me a week to figure out how to get there.&nbsp; But get there I did, and have been here for almost 2 years.&nbsp; I was obsessed with Silk Road and all it could offer.&nbsp; For the first time, I could safely order the things I wanted on an occasional basis; for special occasions.&nbsp; And such an event was quickly approaching.&nbsp; I had absolutely no idea at the time how this website would change my life forever.&nbsp; <br /><br />A group of friends and I had plans to attend a week long party in Key West called Fantasy Fest.&nbsp; For those of you not lucky enough to be familiar with Fantasy Fest, let me do my best to explain:<br /><br />The Florida Keys are unlike any other place in the US.&nbsp; It’s a chain of subtropical islands, built primarily on the largesse of drug smuggling and fishing. It’s still common today for mass quantities of drugs to wash ashore.&nbsp; And at the end of this chain of islands sits the city of Key West.&nbsp; The people of the Keys tend to be rugged individualists, and there is a deeply ingrained sense of live and let live. So, once a year, thousands of people descend upon Key West for a week long party of, well, ANYTHING GOES. Bacchanalian excess and revelry rules at Fantasy Fest.<br /><br />So, now having the freedom to safely procure recreational substances, I do just that.&nbsp; One particular vendor named Pfhandelier and his MDMA looked really promising.&nbsp; Several grams were successfully ordered and received.&nbsp; So my boyfriend, friends, Pf’s molly and I head down to Key West for Fantasy Fest.<br />We made up a bunch of packets in advance, and dose as we pull into the parking lot around 4pm.&nbsp; It quickly comes up – I just LOVE that feeling.&nbsp; You know, that feeling you get on good MDMA that’s like a freight train in the distance.&nbsp; When you can feel it coming, and you know there’s nothing you can do to stop it.&nbsp; So I knew what was coming, and holy fuck!!, it was strong.&nbsp; Duly dosed, with that wonderful tingly feeling starting to spread over my body and mind, my boyfriend’s friend takes me by the hand.&nbsp; “C’mon, Killerglass, we’re going to get you painted”.<br /><br />You see, body painting is the way the clever citizens of Key West get around public nudity laws.&nbsp; Artists are set up all over the city during Fantasy Fest, anointing the faithful with paint. By now, I was pretty close to full rolling balls status, so I went along eagerly, with a huge smile on my face.<br /><br />So in broad daylight, right on Duval Street, there I stood. Naked. With some guy dressed like a goofy pirate airbrushing my body.&nbsp; This was something that I never imagined in a MILLION years I would do.&nbsp; But not only was I doing it, but I loved it.&nbsp; I had spent the last 30 years ashamed of my body.&nbsp; And here I was in paradise, with good friends, and a head full of Pf’s molly, about to embark on a night that would change my life forever.<br /><br />What a time we had that night!! Roaming the streets of Key West, me covered only in paint, cowboy boots and a cowboy hat.&nbsp; Rolling so hard, my boys had to keep a close eye on me, lest I wander off.&nbsp; One of the most amazing things about Fantasy Fest is that in a place so charged by nudity, debauchery, alcohol and drugs, is the respect attendees have for one another.&nbsp; It is truly a safe place to wander around naked. People are free to be whom and what they want.&nbsp; There was such an amazing sense of freedom.&nbsp; Here, on this little 6 square mile island, are adults enjoying a lifestyle most can only imagine.<br /><br />I loved everybody, and everybody loved me. The MDMA made me feel so open….open and comfortable in a way that was unknown and new to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Men, women, husbands, wives, gay, straight, young and old……we were all part of something much greater than ourselves.&nbsp; We were celebrating freedom; freedom and being alive.&nbsp; Celebrating with 50,000 other revelers on the tropical streets of Key West.<br /><br />And here I was – that scared, insecure 11 year old girl.&nbsp; All grown up. Enjoying a sense of freedom I had never before felt.&nbsp; What those bastards took from me 30 years ago was taken back.&nbsp; It was reclaimed in the most colorful and amazing way.&nbsp; That night has changed me forever.&nbsp; Sure, the night was about partying, rolling, good friends and debauchery.&nbsp; But soon after, I realized something more important, more cosmic, and much deeper had happened in that tropical paradise.&nbsp; I was free for the first time in my life.&nbsp; And that freedom has not gone away – it has stayed with me.&nbsp; My chains were permanently broken that night.&nbsp; I will never be the same.<br /><br />And that, my dear friends, is the story of how Silk Road, PF’s molly and Fantasy Fest set me free.&nbsp; Forever.<br /><br />

				A long time ago..<br />So the day started, a beautifully sunny summers day. A pretty normal day by all accounts.. went to work, came home and suddenly decided that it would be a great idea to invited a couple of people over to try MDMA and 2c-B (all of our first times). <br />I drove to where they lived as I was giving them a lift back to mine where we would be taking the substances.<br />The people I had over I am very close with, probably some of my two closest guy mates (at the time anyway).. (3 guys on MDMA + 2c-B.. i know what you&#039;re thinking but no.. none of us had experienced the aphrodisiac power of these substances before lol.) So we got back to mine where I proceeded to whip the MDMA and 2c-b out. The MDMA was 1g of some very tasty tan moonrock, if I remember correctly it was just one fat rock. So I proceeded to crush this up using a deodorant can whilst it was still in the baggie. I will never forget that smell upon opening up the bag.. strong sweet smell of sassafras which whenever I smell now just instantly sends shivers of happiness down my spine.&nbsp; But anyway, once this was all crushed I decided I wanted to bomb mine, but my other two friends both wanted to snort it. I grabbed my scales and measured out 120mg&#039;s exactly. Whilst my friends cut up two equally sized lines for themselves. I wrapped the 120mg&#039;s into a rizla, and with slight apprehension, downed it with water. <br />My friends snorted there lines, with one of them bouncing back in pain and tears starting to stream down his face. I just laughed at him. But as there&#039;s was going to hit a lot faster than mine, they persuaded me to have a small line just to get things off to a flying start. <br />So I measured out a small line, crushed the powder hard onto a plate using a card, listened out for that cracking noise MDMA makes when you crush it against something hard and proceeded to make a straight line with the card. I rolled up a bank note, stuck it close to my nose, dipped my head down towards the line, took a deep breath out and slowly but surely sniffed the line. My friends were amazed at how effortlessly I did it in comparison to them, although it stung my nose quite a bit I don&#039;t think the pain effected me as much as it did them.<br />A few moments passed and I felt the urge to walk out into the garden. The setting was a nice, sunny evening. My friends remained in the room that was facing the garden, with the doors closed so we close still speak. I remember I took my top off as I started to feel very hot. Then.. BAM, I was stuck with an overwhelming sense of panic but at the same time excitement. My whole body was rushing, I felt like I was gunna be sick but I gathered myself. I remember turning to my friends who were sat in the room facing the garden and just saying &#039;WOW its defiantly kicking in now&#039;. One of my friends asked if I was ok, but I couldn&#039;t even gather myself to reply as the overwhelming feelings continued. My other friend reassured him that I was okay and that I was coming up pretty hard.<br />So there I was standing in the middle of the garden feeling like I&#039;m about to have the biggest panic attack of my life, but then I stopped and thought &#039;this is it kicking in, you&#039;re about to have a very good night&#039;. This thought kept repeating in my head for about 30 seconds, until I remember slowly looking up at my friends and feeling the biggest sense of empathy and euphoria wash over me in a way that no words can describe, I will remember that moment for the rest of my life. Everything became so clear all of a sudden, and I felt a sense of happiness throughout my entire body that I&#039;ve never felt before. Although it all felt so new, it felt so right and I felt so comfabtale with it, with everything. I kept remember thinking to myself, how is it even possible to feel this good? The only way to disrobe that first time on MDMA is perfect. <br />Me and my friends (who were now also rollin balls, but didn&#039;t have the same harsh comeup like I did) then just sat in pure amazement talking about really deep things, which girls we like, which girls we would fuck etc.. typical guy talk. But on MDMA it feels so meaningful and it appears to stay with you, it&#039;s hard to describe. At some point we decided it would be a good idea to bring down some duvets to wrap ourselves in. So we decided to get pretty much naked and wrap ourselves in them, the feels were pure &#039;ecstasy&#039;, excuse the pun lol. I also remember walking out into the garden and laying in the grass (by which point it was completely dark now) facing up at the stars. It was a very special moment. <br />By this point we were all down to just wearing boxers.. About 4 hours after we started rolling, we decided it was time to take the 2c-b..<br />I opened up the 20mg cap of 2c-b we had and separated it into 3 equal lines onto a dinner plate. Thats roughly 7mg each. (picture 3 guys in their boxes standing around a plate lol.) We proceeded to bend down and snort the lines. We then walked back into the room nearest the garden and sat down, the conversation was rapidly flowing from one topic to another when I started looking at the wall because it was starting to wave and move about. I felt a warm rush of pleasantness flow through my body, it almost felt like a river of warmness flowing around my stomach area. I remember saying outloud &#039;I think I&#039;m starting to trip&#039; with a huge smile on my face. <br />By this time it was pitch black outside so I thought I it would be a good idea to step outside to see if the visuals intensified in the darkness, and boy did they! I remember, firstly looking up at the sky and seeing the stars so intensely bright, and then walked down the garden a bit more when out of no where a bright blue/purple deer jumped out of the bushes and strolled over towards me. I was completely in-ore by it&#039;s beauty. This hallucination must of lasted about 10/20seconds before I looked away and alas, it was gone. I then remember sitting in the middle of the garden with my friend in complete hysterical laughter over pretty much nothing. I took out my phone and put a strobe light function on, and fuck me, this made things very triply indeed, I remember seeing hundreds of birds in the sky, the same blue/purple colour as the deer. After about 15seconds of strobing, it got a bit intense so I decided to switch it off. It&#039;s near impossible to put into words at how amazed, euphoric and loved up I was, both for my friends but with nature as well. I Felt connected with nature. <br />As the peak was slowly fading away we decided to take a walk to the park to watch the sunrise. It was the most incredible sunrise I have ever witness, the deep oranges mixed with the vibrant reds and yellows was something special. After this we decided to smoke one last joint before walking back and getting some well deserved sleep.<br /><br />I will never forget this night, my first experience with both MDMA and 2c-b. <br />Hope you enjoyed my story.

				In this last year I&#039;ve used DMT extensively and so, about a month ago, I thought I established enough of a relationship with the powers dwelling in the substance as to try something very specific as going into the so-called Enochian Aethyrs through them. Many years prior I already visited the place with the help of a special skrying device, a black mirror, and it seemed to me a very interesting proposition to try the difference the experience would have had with the help of DMT. <br />&nbsp;<br />I think a little parenthesis is needed now to explain what the Enochian Aethyrs are. They are considered a sort of map or the universe in the form of 30 concentric rings that expand from the innermost (the first, LIL, the highest) to the outermost (the thirty, TEX, the lowest). It is said that to advance in every succeeding Aethyr you have to pass certain tests that are learned in the preceding one; the more you advance the more time it can take to incorporate the teachings you received in the Aethyr you last visited. Every step works as a sort of ladder of initiation of the individual, with some steps that can possibly require years to pass. To reach the innermost Aethyrs for some individuals it can be a task not be resolved in a lifetime. The sign that you cannot pass in the next Aethyr is usually evidenced by the fact that you are &quot;blocked&quot; by some force or you cannot perceive anything but a total void.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />To enter the Aethyrs a special call (i.e. invocation) is needed, uttered in a special language, called Enochian; this language was discovered by the 16th century&#039;s magician Dr. John Dee with the help of his assistant Edward Kelley after a series of visions thereunto which they supposedly contacted entities that described to them the full system, including this sort of map of the universe called &quot;the Cry of the Thirty Aethyrs&quot;. Notwithstanding one believing or not in these &quot;revelations&quot;, in the reality of the language and/or the Aethyrs, it is unquestionable for everyone that tried the aforementioned calls that something very specific happens by uttering them, and some very specific places &quot;open up&quot; by them with very specific encounters. The visions of the entities or places can vary from person to person in the external manifestations (that naturally varies on the subjective traits of the individual), but the generic structure is usually always the same - if it is not it&#039;s because there is probably an error in the procedure. <br />&nbsp;<br />This report takes place in the 28th Aethyr, called BAG. The precedent two tries - while very informative and important for me on the fact that something like this could, indeed, be done - were less interesting from a purely visionary standpoint since I had still to determine best doses and approach on the procedure. The experience of BAG was instead of a very visionary nature and so it was perfect for a report of this kind; BAG in itself is a very interesting Aethyr anyways because there is something very specific happening there that you will discover if you read the report. <br />&nbsp;<br />To enter the Aethyr with the help of DMT I used three threshold doses of 15 mg. in lapses of about 20 min. before a full dose of 40 mg. This gave me two well defined advantages: the first is that in this way the &quot;traveling in the spirit vision&quot; (a breakthrough in esoteric terms) is - at last from my personal findings of previous experiments with DMT - enhanced and longer, and the second is that in this way I could prepare the call with a previous &quot;opening of the Watchtowers&quot; in the threshold lapses (in very simple terms this is in Enochian the invocation of the fourth elemental parts of the universe: fire, earth, water, air - plus in this case spirit) and acknowledge if everything did go correctly at every step. <br /><br />The report is reproduced from my diary. I expanded some points as to define better the feelings and emotions, added some comment so that the report could be followed better by those not having knowledge of esoteric terms, and removed some parts having to do with numeric symbolism of an occultist nature that have not an important place in a pure trip report. I am sorry for the length of this introduction but I thought it was needed so that the reader could really enjoy more what is happening.<br /><br />Now, to the report!<br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />* Report Title: BAG vs. DMT<br />* Date Experienced: 26/05/2013<br />* Substance(s) Used &amp; Dosage(s): DMT, 15 mg. (x3) + 40 mg.<br />* Vendor Purchased From: Multi Exciter<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />I began by performing the Opening of the Watchtowers of Fire and Earth, then the ones of Water and Air and lastly the one of Spirit. During every opening I smoked the DMT using the charges of 15 mg. that I prepared in anticipation. I took close attention to the portal and the visions to understand if all was in affinity with the calls. <br /><br />[In my experiments with DMT I&#039;ve discovered that the so-called &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; - the term becoming notorious after the mention of it by Gracie &amp; Zarkov - can evidence quite well with the colors that are displayed in it the nature of the experience you are going to have; this is especially useful for what it concerns specific experiments in exploring elemental planes and similar things. If the colors don&#039;t match the nature of the plane something did go wrong in the preparation. For this I call it &quot;the portal&quot;, because it acts just as a portal opening through a plane, tuning on the right frequency; well... now that I think about it I could call it &quot;the tuner&quot; instead]<br /><br />My last charge with the full dose was now ready to be used. I had some lingering doubts on the dose while watching the pipe, given how my two previous attempts had not produced quite exactly what I aimed for: the first one was too timid and I acted more as a spectator of the Aethyr than a full participant on it, while in the second case the influence of DMT was too strong and the Aethyr was partaking too much of its &quot;vibe&quot;. I repeated the Call of the 28th Aethyr three times, intensifying the recitation at every rehearsal, then inhaled the smoke, lowered the hood into my face and relaxed back. At the showing of the portal I repeated rhythmically the last sentence of the call as a mantra until the veil rendered and I found myself in that wonderful, familiar, place.<br /><br />[The sentence being &quot;ODO CICLE QAA, OD OZAZMA PLAPI IDANAMAD&quot; that it means &quot;Open the mysteries of your creation, and make us partakers of undefiled knowledge&quot;]<br /><br />I recognized immediately the panorama: white crystalline sand onto which different size&#039;s formations of black quartz crystals erupted. My happiness on acknowledging that everything did go correctly, however, lasted shorty; it left place to a struggling concern once I started noticing that it was as if I was looking at the vision from a glass frame. Once again, like in my first experiment, I was a mere spectator watching a sort of movie. <br /><br />[In esoteric terms when you are acting as a spectator is called &quot;skrying&quot;, when you are instead inside the vision as a full performer then it&#039;s &quot;traveling in the spirit vision&quot;; the difference is not just on the terms used but on the quality of the experience: in skrying, in fact, you are not acting as like having a body - usually called the dream or astral body - within the vision, you don&#039;t have all your senses with you, at most vision and hearing, moreover skyring is usually much more of a symbolic nature than &quot;traveling&quot;; it is the same difference between remote viewing and an OBE]<br /><br />An internal diatribe started within myself as on the right doses to use and what was wrong in the procedure, what should I have done instead and how to ensure everything would go correctly next time. My thinking process got my total, undeserved attention; I was so totally lost in my internal diatribe that I almost completely lost the vision, until a voice seemingly coming from a distant part of the universe yelled: &quot;Do not worry, act!&quot; (or this was what I got from it). In usual circumstances the quality and tone of that singular voice and its clarity (it was like the sound of a thunder concentrated inside my cranium) would have caught my full attention, but at that moment the message coming from that voice was so devastating that there was no place for anything else. I was jolted back from my concerns by its sheer force, and this gave me possibility to pause and ponder on how idiotically I was behaving. After all these years there I stood, acting like a total novice, blocking myself with doubts and wandering thoughts. I did immediately shut my chattering, regained confidence and began contemplating the vision, immersing myself in it.<br /><br />[Doses can indeed make a difference, but the most important part is always in yourself and how you approach the experience. Doubts and bad modus operandi can render ineffective even the most powerful agent]<br /><br />The sand had a shiny look to it, like if being mixed with some reflective substance. In the distance the reflections made the sand look like a gigantic white sea at dawn, when the light of the sun reflects in it, turning the crested water in a sort of inverted night sky. The black obelisks were, in contrast, black as one can fathom a black hole to be; it had a sense of infinite depth, similar to silvered glass placed upon black velvet. I had the definite impression that if I stared too intensely at them I could be sucked in that endless, formless black. I was so immersed on the contemplation of the panorama that I lost the transition from the flat, 2D like vision of before, to the now 3D one with full sense of depth. I continued immersing myself more and more in the vision until, finally, I passed through.<br /><br />[Passing through a vision - if it doesn&#039;t happen automatically - it is a very difficult process to explain, because it is sort of like an indirect act of will. It is like willing with all your soul to go there without at the same time caring if you really succeed or not. It is the epitome of acting without lust of result. Usually if you are genuinely interested in the vision it happens by itself because in that moment you are, in fact, indirectly willing to go there, so much absorbed by the vision that you indeed desire with all your soul to be there, but there is no time to really *care* to be there]<br /><br />The first impact I had was that the sand was cold as ice, my feet ached at the contact until I got used to it. The air was in the same way like a soft breeze around me, making me involuntarily shiver for a moment. I noticed that I was wearing a red silk tunic, and in my right hand I had a golden ring in the shape of a serpent, coiled three and half times on the index finger, with a ruby mounted on its head. The colors were much more vibrant then the other times I visited the place, the scene pulsating with an internal spark of light that seemed to breath life in every thing I was placing my eyes into. The DMT definitely gave the vision an aura of power and energy that it didn&#039;t possess normally. I was in awe by the intensity of the scene: the sand now appeared to me for what it really was, an ocean of infinitesimal mirror scales reflecting each others&#039; internal light and the light coming from outside. The black obelisks where alive and pulsated inside with tiny veins of ultraviolet, acting like a sort of electric generators powering the vision. Around me gusts of wind carried a strange melody that at closer scrutiny seemed like a monotonous litany repeated ad infinitum. At that moment my curiosity on what the winds were muttering arose a thought in my mind, but the thought had to climb from a distant place, seemingly as having to battle intensely to come to the surface. <br /><br />[Until that occurrence my thoughts had completely vanished and after some time you are in a status like that it takes effort to start thinking again, in the same way as it take efforts to stop the internal chattering]<br /><br />As in response to my request a distant voice as the one I heard previously said: &quot;The winds carry through the four towers of the universe the praises and invocations to the Governors of the Aethyr till the day of the reunion, when the Prince held in chains in the Dudael will be set free and the babes of the Abyss will be born again.&quot;<br /><br />[It is difficult to explain what the &quot;voice&quot; was. It was not really a voice, the message came directly, yet when you recall it it sounded exactly as a voice. Again as before I didn&#039;t make much notice of the voice and the unique characteristics of it: I&#039;ve heard many times before in other visions parts of myself talk as external voices to me, but in this instance the thing was completely different and the voice was not something I could in any way reconcile to a part of me. Looking at the report I now think I was indeed followed during the vision, and much probably the voice was a spirit coming from the DMT. As for what the voice said: it is difficult to explain and it has not much place here, but just as a little clarification the &quot;Prince held in chains in the Dudael&quot; is Azazel. Biblical tied revelations are not uncommon in the Aethyrs, especially for us Westerners since these concepts are, willingly or unwillingly, knowledge that is tied in our culture and something we can directly relate to]<br /><br />The winds acquired more and more clarity until the melody became a distinctly call to three names &quot;LABNIXP, FOCISNI, OXLOPAR&quot;, arising in tone by and by until the sound of it was so strong that the vision trembled at its echo, almost on the verge of shattering. Then - silence - for a moment that seemed to last an eternity.<br /><br />[LABNIXP, FOCISNI, OXLOPAR are the three Governors presiding over the 28th Aethyr, BAG. Every Aethyr has a set of governors ruling over it; usually they are three but in some cases they can be two]<br /><br />------&gt;

				&lt;---------------<br /><br />The vision was now completely still. The sound of silence was covering it as an heavy mantle, the pressure verging on the point of being unbearable. Then, suddenly, a sense of relief, the mantle as removed and from the sand emerging, encompassed by a vortex, three hooded figures. Their tunics were made in the same fabric of the obelisks, of a black that had the depth of the infinite in which pulsated little veins of violet, the hoods covering completely their faces. They stood still for a moment, seemingly inspecting who the visitor was, then they opened their tunics revealing skeleton bodies having in their chests seven ribs each. In turn they removed their ribs and placed them on the ground, forming a sigil on the sandy ground: the first one the first rib, then the fifth and the sixth, the second one the fourth, the first one the seventh, the second one the fifth and lastly the third one the third rib. After having done this the three Governors dissapeared into the ground, leaving behind their ribs in the ground placed in form of a sigil.<br /><br />[The seven ribs represents the letters in the names of the three Governors, LABNIXP, FOCISNI, OXLOPAR. The result is: LIX + I + P + S + L = LIXIPSL, being the Guardian of the Aethyr, a special acquaintance of this particular Cry. It is to note that all three Governors have names composed of seven letters each and from their names they gave birth to another Entity with, yet again, seven letters in His name. This has naturally possess a meaning having to do with the nature of the Aethyr, but this is not the place to elaborate on the gematria]<br /><br />From the ribs lines of light emerged reaching the sky, and up above in the clouds appeared reflected the figure of the sigil. The structure appeared like a sort of electric cage emanating from the ground and reaching the sky, the lines of which opened a portal into another place from whom a figure stepped in, a figure I recognized immediately: LIXIPSL, the Guardian of the Aethyr. From my last encounter He seemed now less imponent, His stature being only about half a meter higher than mine. Still the feel of His presence had no impact from this exterior change. An immediate sense of something alien, ancient and immensely powerful overcame me, a shiver passed up and down my spine, cold penetrating deep into my bones turning them to ice, and the feeling of pure fear obliterating everything else. Nothing remained but LIXIPSL&#039;s presence and the fear that embraced the vision in her all-reaching arms.<br /><br />[The encounter of an Entity that can be understood as outside of the boundaries of the self always include a sense of innate hostily towards the encounter, the same effect as a thought recognized as external from yourself would. Of this particular sensation many magicians have talked about in the past, as Aleister Crowley. It is to note, also, that real fear is a feeling of the body, not rising from a thought. If fear comes from a thought it is usually a state of anxiety, not of real fear]<br /><br />For a moment the fear externalized visually: everything but the figure of LIXPIPSL blacked out, and He was surrounded by this fog of pitch black, enclosed in an halo of crimson.&nbsp; He had a long attire seemingly of chain-mail, reaching and trailing the ground. His complexion was of a dark blue with shades of purple, His enormous eyes of shining white without iris nor pupils. In the right hand He carried a scepter made of the same quartz as the obelisks on the top of which stood three heads: one of a lion, one of an eagle and one of a bull. Time was suspended, the fear battling with the awe. As soon as the fear vanished the vision returned, and the blow of it was akin to something having being kept pressurized for times immemorial then suddenly and all at once forcefully re-expanded to normal atmosphere; my hears hissed like steam from the impact - a bubble expanding retracing in its path the vision once again. <br /><br />LIXIPSL approached me till I could almost reach Him. From this distance I could now discern things better and I recognized that His attire was not of what seemed to me before chainmail but made of mirrors&#039; scales not different from the sand, only of a greater size. He almost imperceptibly nodded with the head as a sort of greeting, then He did the same with something or someone above my left shoulder, this time with a more pronounced movement of the head.<br /><br />[Again, at that moment it seemed all perfectly normal to me. When I then recollected the vision I noticed the strangeness of the thing. I suppose that, as before, this is evidence that something was indeed at my side during the experience and that the Guardian acknowledged it, actually giving the thing - whatever it was - more reverence than to myself, even if I had already met the Guardian in the past two times in two different occasions]<br /><br />He made another step or two, being now so close that His chest was almost touching my face. The scales in the chest reflected my face in thousands of other faces, by and by distorting them till they represented completely different individuals. At the same time also my consciousness was divided into thousands of pieces, each belonging to a specific reflection. I was aware of all those alternate consciousness at the same time, along the one I usually tie with what I can call &quot;myself&quot;, my consciousness of being alive. Usually as an human you are aware only of what it feels to be &quot;you&quot;, this time for the first time in my life I was capable of feeling other consciousness co-existing along mine, in full. It was like watching a palace with many faces at the windows and being able to feel all at once the emotions, impressions, thoughts and memories of those individuals, everyone of them having a definite story, experience and a way of perceiving their own consciousness, a personal way of perceiving they are alive.<br /><br />My consciousness divided more and more, expanding with the scales in the attire, until this last reached the sand, merging with it. My consciousness flowed in the sand with its infinite shards dividing once more, in even more shards, in infinite pieces encompassing all the never-ending plain. When the shards touched the obelisks I could perceive that they were holes in another universe of sand containing in themselves another infinite plain with obelisks as the ones I was perceiving, each one of them containing yet other plains in a never-ending cycle. I was living billions of lives inside my lifetime; in one I was a pregnant woman abandoned by her husband and committing suicide for the pain, in another I was a doctor addicted to opiates, in another I was a powerful cynic businessman, in yet another one I was a schizophrenic serial killer, and so on and so forth, in every one of those lifes feeling all the pains, joy, emotions and sensations contained in every respective consciousnesses, ad infinitum. The feelings were so powerful, so intense; I let myself lose completely to it, embracing both the torture and the ecstasy of my consciousness separating in infinite shards yet at the same time keeping its integrity so that the memory of each of them at once could obliterate everything else.<br /><br />[I had already experienced something like this, but it was nothing in comparison to what I experienced this time with the help of DMT. This last gave me the possibility of really living those other consciousness and not only being aware of them as in the other case. I literally lived billions of lives in the lapse of the experience. It was sort of like, to make a comparison that many of the readers can comprehend, in Inception, where a dream is created inside a dream and every step doubles the time passed in the previous stage]<br /><br />I lost myself in it for what it seemed like million of years, fully absorbing that wonderful experience. But then I already knew what it was about, I already knew the &quot;trick&quot; of it, and by and by I detached myself from the feelings, detaching myself from those lifes and mine, watching them for what they were and nothing more, acting as a spectator - willingly this time. I already knew the trick of the Guardian and the point of the Aethyr. Depending on your nature a different test is proposed to you and you have to pass it to being able to go further in the other Aethyrs. For some people the test can be physical, as literally battling the Guardian with weapons, for others it can be a psychological tests, for yet others it can be a philosophical one. Being myself an emotional individual - feeling the compassion for humanity as a whole, so to speak - and an aesthetic one, always looking at the detail in the things, the test was build specifically upon those traits this time. Had I completely lost myself in the feeling of the sadness of humanity (or either its opposite, the beauty of it) or on the infinite intricate details of the experience in its visual stimuli I would have remained there until the DMT finished its course, not able to understand what it was about or even worse bringing with me only the external lesson of the experience, not the real and internal one (that the external part of the consciousness - for as much beautiful as it is - it is still temporary, but there is that wich, instead, remains, and this thing, the real Self, it is not concerned about pain or happiness, about sadness or beauty, it is only concerned about being and experiencing). Depending on my stubbornness I would have stood there thinking that was a wonderful thing to experience and living it time and time again, even more losing myself in it and missing the point. The Guardian approaches His work pretty well.<br /><br />My consciousness shrinked back by and by, first encompassing only the sand, then the attire as a whole, till at last I was looking at my divided reflection in the chest of LIXIPSL. I then made a step back and smiled at the Guardian. The vision was beginning to crack, a sign that the effect of the DMT was almost to vanish. LIXIPSL turned His back on me, tracing something in the ground with His staff, then dissapearing. Where He stood, in the sand, He left three names: SAZAMI, MATHULA, KRPANIB being the three Governors of the 27th Aethyr, ZAA. After this the Aethyr closed and I found myself in my body again.<br /><br />I removed the hood from my face and I watched my room. All was as I left it. 35 minutes had passed in this material plane, million of years had gone by where I was. I started immediately writing the experience in my diary so as to recollect every detail of it, and I was amazed by the power of DMT and how much more vivid and intense the experience was in comparison to usual. I then stood up and did go to drink and eat to re-collect myself fully into this world.<br /><br />END. <br /><br />&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Sorry for this late add-on but it was really necessary. I forgot to include this &quot;thanks section&quot; in the original post and every time I come here it feels like a piece is missing. I did change nothing of the original report, just added this little section dedicated to thanks. I hope it&#039;s not something that will cause trouble.<br /><br />- I want to greatly thank Multi-Exciter for his wonderful product. Thank you ME, your DMT gave me the opportunity to visit places and do things in a way that I could have not imagined possible before.<br /><br />- Above all I want to thank you, DMT Spirit, whatever or whoever you may be and wherever you are. Thank you from the deepness of my heart for everything you have taught me since this day and for all the wonderful things you have shown me.<br /><br />- Lastly (but not in order of gratitude) I want to thank AnimusVox for creating this thread and all the people participating and/or reading the reports and judging on them. It is my sincere hope that it will be possible one day to have a section as in Erowid dedicated to hints, experiences, safety precautions etc. for every substance; I really think that with the knowledge and experience people have in this place Erowid would look like a joke in comparison.<br /><br />

				* Report Title:&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the Vibrations of Your soul<br /><br />* Date Experienced:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;December 2012<br /><br />* Substance(s) Used &amp; Dosage(s): 2 Hits of LSD ( hoffmans)<br /><br />* Vendor Purchased From:<br />&nbsp; JerseyCow<br /><br />Setting:&nbsp; This was a room trip with one of my best friend of almost 10 years now, who turn me on to LSD at the beginning of 2012.<br /><br />As the sun begin to rise, and my eyes began to peel open i knew that today was the day.&nbsp; I woke up from my slumber to jump in the shower and text my buddy to get ready and come over. There was still dew on the bushes from the morning fog when i opened the door to friendly face. The tea on the stove begins to simmer, fresh fruit is prepared and morning breakfast is being served. As we eat we, reminisce about previous trips and begin to laugh at life and how far we have connected as human beings, as friends.&nbsp; We both place 2 hits under our tongues and let them dissolve for 15min before we swallow.<br /><br />As we wait for the come up we smoke a bit of hash to easy the nerves and enjoy the sunrise. Our bodies begin to tingle, a surge of energy begins to coarse through our bodies, we look at each other and nod in agreement, with the biggest similes on our faces, its coming. The grass begins to wave and breath slightly back and forth. A shift in thinking starts to occur, headspace begins to create introspective thinking. At this point my friend wants to go put in a movie and enjoy the peak. We flip through some movie titles, Anchorman, Scott pillgram vs the world, and then Project X.<br /><br />We decided to watch project X, a seemingly fun, action packed college movie about a crazy weekend house party. Visuals are getting more and more intense, the room begins to melt and become part of us as a whole. Texture on the walls have begun to dance and shift shapes. At this point euphoria has taken over, smiles are all over the place, vibrations are floating and inner energy begins to peak through the human form. Faces of actors are juxtaposing, colors are appearing as they shouldnt. My friend looks over at me and time begins to string out, he smiles and laughes at me &quot; the football field isnt supposed to be blue&quot;. A fit of laughing rage over takes us and we begin to roll on the floor hysterically. The peak is in full effect, im laying down on my bed and my friend in a rolling office chair. <br /><br />As i begin to shift my vision from the tv to him, i see waves of energy piercing through his skin as if he had layers of colorful and vibrant energy, sort of like how onion have layers. I stare at him and he stares at the tv, he looks over at me and begins to ramble, It just so happened to be that a girl we both went to school with had played a small roll in the movie we where watching, and that fact had just occured to him. Within second of him of stating this girls name, we stare back towards the TV and BAM, she appears in the corner of our eyes, like it was meant to be, the one scene, the 2 minutes of screen time she had and we pin point the exact moment she appeared in the whole movie. A rush of confused emotions begin to overtake, Happiness, confusion, shock, at what just happened, the biggest mindfuck ever.<br />The movie is coming close to the end and one particular scene begins to start. Two of the main characters begin to interact in a sexual manner sort to speak, a sexy female begins to climb up onto this kids bed. Time begins to slow down as things begin to heat up, as the female begins to slowly kiss the kid, i begin to feel the emotions one would be felling if you where in the kids position, she climbs up on him straddling him, i begin to feel flushed, and erotic sense overcomes me as i feel like im becoming part of the movie, my emotions are attached to ever movement from this female, almost as if i was reacting to the situation in real life. The scene ends and i look over at my friend and he begin to look at me, both with this astonished and puzzled look on our faces &quot; wtf just happened&quot;. Our emotions had merge with the movie, reality was non existent for a short period of time.<br /><br />The peak has worn off, and visuals are still floating about. We decided to listen to some music while we transition back into reality. <br />I turn on my computer and sift through my itunes libary, we listen to some Electro house music and smoke some more hash to easy the transition. With every inhale of the hash smoke, a calming energy flows throw me, and with every exhale new visuals and patterns begin to emerge. <br />A song begins to play &quot; it is the dawn,... it,.. its..the... it is the dawn,... time has shifted&quot;. Once again we float off into a trance state of being as this song plays out, time begins to string and slow. A countdown begins as if we where about to launch off, 1............ time slows down even further....2....... time becomes none existent.................3................... we stare at my computer screen background, which was a photo from alex grey of 3 men holding objects with geometric shapes and fractals. We began to merge with the computer screens background photo, flames began to rise from the palms of one of the images hands, the fractals in the background began to tick and tick, click and shift with each numbered count down from the song. The background image began to make sense, an understanding of time and motion set in, the song still slowly playing out in the background. At this point we are fully mesmerized as we felt we had launched off into a parallel dimension, meditating, melting with song and image. The song ends and we come to from our mediation, what had felt like 15minutes was only a matter of 5.&nbsp; My friend looks at me and ask me if what just happened was real, what we had experience was to cool to put into words. We head down stairs and munch on some fruit and some juice. I grab a bowl of blackberries to munch on, the flavor was out of this world, the texture of the blackberries felt like they where bursting in my mouth, each little nub of the bumpy texture exploded when chewed. At this point we are fully come down with minor head space, residual effects lingering away.<br /><br /><br />Hope yall enojy, this was my 4 trip ever and was one of the funnest ive had to date. ;)<br />The song that played at the end was Gorillaz- speak it mountains.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				This is an older experience, but it&#039;s one of my favorite things I&#039;ve written; hopefully y&#039;all will enjoy it.<br /><br />How I Spent My Summer Vacation<br />Date: September 2009<br />Substance/dosage: MDMA/1 big-ass rock<br />Purchased from: N/A<br /><br />It is 2:00 when we reach the island and bass is throbbing out across the East River as the ferry pulls up to the pier.&nbsp; I worry that the police along the dock will be searching people, but they appear to be there only as a deterrent, and let us pass without so much as a frisking.&nbsp; Lines and tickets and lines and tickets and a quick pat-down that reveals nothing because Andrew’s got the stuff in his shoe and we’re inside and the hills are green and the beats are everywhere.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I am self-conscious as we approach the first tent and feel awkward—I don’t know the rules, how do I act, who is looking, what are they thinking? Andrew is utterly oblivious to this.&nbsp; He is immediately twisting and gyrating and smiling and a part of it.&nbsp; I would like his ebullience.&nbsp; I shed a little of my fear and begin to feel the beat and energy as the bass rises, drops out, resumes and the crowd convulses, an aural orgasm rippling through tightly packed bodies.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We meet Peter, and his friends, and sit in some shade, trying to conserve a little energy.&nbsp; It’s hot and my shirt sticks to me and I am impatient, anxious, excited, above all excited and waiting.&nbsp; We drop at 5:30 and the molly tastes awful: bitter at the front of my tongue and then melting into an awful tangy miasma that coats the back of my throat and almost makes me retch.&nbsp; I struggle to swallow it so I can drink something to wash away the taste.&nbsp; Then waiting.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And waiting.&nbsp; We head to the gate to wait for Andrew’s friend Eric, who has become a ubiquitous presence when I am in various states of altered consciousness.&nbsp; As we wait, something is happening, and where before I was maybe a bit tired, worn down by the beating sun and overwhelmed by the crowd, I am all of a sudden energized, wanting to move and smile and greet people as they enter.&nbsp; Eric arrives, a pack of girls in tow ranging from gorgeous to not-so-much.&nbsp; I get hugs, a look from one who says her name is Rachel that suggests more than just passing interest, and we’re inside one of the tents and now my body is feeling the beat and moving of its own accord; brain is disconnected as hips pump and slide and head thumps in chorus with the god of the day that humming thudding bass that crushes all resistance in its path and makes all of us into merry fools.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Topher and Whitney arrive and smile when they see that I am smiling and we walk toward the main stage and now I am really starting to roll, the euphoria rising risingrisingrising higher as I smile at strangers passing me and want to hug them and tell them how interesting their lives must be and won’t they oh please won’t they tell me their story and tell me that I mean as much to them as they mean to me right now which is to say everything.&nbsp; Kaskade is slightly boring but I don’t really care because everything is upupupup and I am right along with it reveling higher than high among the most beautiful people in the world.&nbsp; Deadmau5 starts his set and I am intrigued, then anticipatory as monophonic synths build and then it’s unbearable I want it I need it please god give it to me let me have that fucking deep syrupy grinding BASS that thunders into the ground and renders me insensible laughing and hysterical as my body turns into a dervish sans the twirling but in all the same religious ecstasy my god this sound it fills my eardrums and then my brain and then suffuses my skin and flesh and demands joyous movement.&nbsp; It’s sexual and asexual and sensual all at once I am a quivering mass of feeling—my hands feel&nbsp; electric touching my own skin and then Whitney sees my state of near-combustion and starts to scratch the back of my head and white lights explode in front of my eyes and I shriek with delight nearly losing all touch with reality.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We are dancing, dancing, we must dance for if we stop we will surely die.&nbsp; The sun is setting&nbsp; and the skyline is illuminated red and orange and godly and the bodies around me are all filled with holy light and fire.&nbsp; Andrew hugs me and kisses me on the cheek and I do the same to him because I love him.&nbsp; Rachel wants to dance and she clearly likes me, giving me winks and squeezing my arm when she turns to talk to her friends and to be wanted is suddenly the most important thing in the universe, or perhaps not quite—the most important thing is still to dance, to feel this divine rhythm resonating in the space between my nerve endings where my soul resides.&nbsp; Things happen.&nbsp; I do not remember them all because time is a blur and space is a blur and there is only sound and light and love.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Armin van Buuren begins his set and to call what I feel happiness is to demean it and bring it down to some pedestrian concept easily apprehended by mortals.&nbsp; I am light and sun and rain and joy and the music is the word of God whispering thunderous in my ears while I vibrate, we all vibrate, notes on a string for one night finding the same tightness, the same frequency and we are one joyous note rising high into the night sky while all around us lights flash and bodies twist and rock and turn and hold fast to the power and the beauty of something that will always exist and will never be again.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We are on a hill and resting and watching as the crowd is a great wave of humanity frequency approximately 35Hz and I hold Rachel’s hand and we talk and I am so happy to share myself with another human being, one that wants me and wants to hear my thoughts and my story and I love her for who she is and what she has given me—this is something perfect and precious and I will always be grateful for it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It is 10:45 and Armin begins his last song and Andrew and I leave the hill to go dance one last time, still moved and uplifted by this miraculous torrent of sound that spills and flows around and through us and everyone else here and it is so beautiful I want to cry I want this music never to leave never to end I want it to wrap me tight in warmth and color and love and promise me that it will always feel like this, that I will always feel the rhythm in my heart of hearts, the one I keep to myself and hold precious that it might remain pure and immaculate and I feel this promise whisper from the speakers as the last notes fade and the crowd slumps into exhaustion and begins to leave.&nbsp; I will hold the music to its promise and I will give it my heart and my love forevermore, because it has made me whole for maybe the first time in my life I feel whole and complete.&nbsp; I am sad, terribly sad that it is over and that we must leave, but in my head for hours afterward there is still the rhythm and the sound and I know that my promise is true and that my heartbeat and those of everyone around me are one and the same, and the thudding bass and perfect melody are locked inside, never to fade.<br /><br />

				* Report Title: Our Glimpse of Nirvana<br />* Date Experienced: 1 june 2013<br />* Substance(s) Used &amp; Dosage(s): 300-350ug LSD and 50mg MDMA<br />* Vendor Purchased From: Indica9 (LSD: glimpse of Nirvana, 300ug) &amp; ItalianMafiaBrussels (mdma)<br /><br />Here&#039;s our first post for this contest... <br />the post is in 2 parts - first I&#039;ll find my GF&#039;s trip report, then you&#039;ll find my report... <br />the experience was... well, I hope you&#039;ll like our description of it! <br /><br />Cheers,<br />R5<br /><br />PS: excuse me/us if there are some/many grammatical errors... English is not our native language (for me it&#039;s the 4th language and for my GF it&#039;s her 3th). <br /><br />PART 1: <br />Glimpse of Nirvana <br />Yesterday we thought about having an LSD-trip together in a beautiful countryside again. The weather was so nice. Lucky us... <br />In the afternoon we started the ritual. Writing our intentions on a piece of paper. My intentions were to learn to accept myself and others for whom they are, without judgments, and to embrace them for whom they are. <br />Learn to work with my intuition without doubts.<br />And hopefully to get my full vision back, sadly this last part wasn&#039;t a success, but the rest… Wauw…<br /><br />We red our intentions to each other and I could also relate with boyfriends intentions. <br />The blotters were placed under our tongue, then my BF asked the spirits of the 4 corners to join us and I had already called Shiva to be present with us in the fire, then we started with a little meditation. That went so well and felt so good.<br /><br />I think after half an hour I started to see a difference already. We sat outside in the sun and I watched the trees. They looked so happy. They were waving in the wind. <br />And the clouds were passing through lay by lay and very fast. <br />Everything was so incredibly sensual. I got horny… very horny … In the beginning it was funny but later on it became annoying. <br />We made a walk through the forest and every tree had his own personality. I saw every scar every dad leaf or branch, I realized that the scarfs were a part of he tree and that they made the tree perfect. I saw how these scars were a part of the individu, how it embellishes the individu and I thought about my scars and how they are a part of me. I learned to accept them because they&#039;re perfect and beautiful. <br />Everything was alive and amazingly beautiful, the trees, the flowers, the birds, the insects… my partner.. hmmm (yeah still horny… and after a while so did he :p ) And there was one phrase going through my mind: &quot;The reason of our existence is to enjoy and the only chance you have to do that is when you&#039;re here and alive. So let go and embrace life… and ENJOY.&quot;<br />And so i did. <br />It was so perfect: the product was the best I ever had, the weather was perfect, the amazing forest was perfect and my partner and dog were perfect.<br />We tried after a while taking some MDMA but it wasn&#039;t giving more value to the trip. We were fine on that LSD-cloud. Happily it didn&#039;t took long before the MDMA wore of and before we were tripping again.&nbsp; <br />We had some amazing sex (Man, that took forever!!!) and a good plate of spaghetti. Took the dog out, smoked a cigar and went of to bed, still a bit tripping.<br />Saw a funny movie and took some Ketamine. That combination was pleasant.<br />And of to sleep in the arms of my lover. I couldn&#039;t have asked for anything else, I was really grateful… Still am.<br /><br />PART 2:<br />Indica9 - &quot;Glimpse of Nirvana&quot; (300μg or more of needlepoint LSD)<br /><br />in short: if you haven&#039;t taken it, please don&#039;t speak about it. We have taken it: &quot;beauty&quot;, any other word couldn&#039;t grasp the essence of our experience. Adding 1 word, even a word such as &quot;perfect&quot;, would only be disturbing in our attempt to describe our feelings during this journey. <br /><br />Technical: zero body-load and zero mind-fuck<br /><br />Longer version…is much longer… :-)<br /><br />Previous LSD-experience: more than a month ago (so tolerance is back to zero). <br /><br />set&amp;setting: perfect &amp; well prepared. At a friends cottage in the woods, no television, no telephone, no internet and cell phones turned of or on silent. Food and beverages ready and at hand. Alone with my GF and dog - no one else to be seen or heard during the whole experience. A beautiful day in the middle of a beautiful forest in wonderful company. Before &quot;taking of&quot; we both write our intentions down on a piece of paper that we place above the fireplace… Set&amp;setting couldn&#039;t have been better… <br /><br />Timetable: <br />15.00h: we take the acid under our tongue, light a fire in the fireplace in the house and invite Shiva to join us during the experience. We also call the spirits of 4 corners and&nbsp; ask them to join us for the trip, to protect and teach us. <br />15.02: we swallow the blotter and start meditating<br />15.30: end of the meditation (during the meditation I could already feel my consciousness changing, I even already had &quot;small bubbles of joy pouring up in my subconscious&quot;). We prepared some of the food and then we each had 1 Belgian beer (9.5% Alc, 33 Cl.) outside in the sun. Looking at an amazing view, with many trees waving at us, becoming personified entities, having an intended contact with us threw the visual communication of their being.<br />16.00h: MY GF&#039;s senses are on hyperdrive, everything feels sensual/sexual. I still have lots of the calmness/introspective peace from the meditation. My GF has NEVER been so sensually aroused from any LSD-experience ever - yes, maybe even more than from any experience ever, never been so &quot;horny&quot; to put it in extremely simple terms… I&#039;m entering the &quot;mushy- phase&quot;, where you start to feel that you walk in a cloud, or that there are little clouds on all part of your body that make every move flowing and soft, round and light. We feel euphoric &amp; we laugh soooo much… <br />16.20: My GF is sooooo super-horny, it&#039;s bothering her to feel her senses, her desire, her lust so strongly in her… we still laugh so much… and my senses also start to be activated (coming from the meditative peace of mind and going into the sensual arousal). <br />17.00: We just made a first little walk in the forest. It was amazingly beautiful. You could actually see the life flow in the trees. We hugged some trees, had a chat with some… 1 tree tell&#039;s me he&#039;s happy I can see &quot;it&quot; now - but he also let&#039;s me know that he&#039;s sad that we normally don&#039;t see &quot;it&quot;. Confronting thought… Our dog loves walking with us in the forest like this. <br />We are now very high up into Lalaland… the experience is quite intense, on the border of overwhelming at times - but the euphoria, the joy and the peace keep us in an excellent state of mind. Deep and beautiful. <br />We&#039;re lying on our backs in the grass and we&#039;re looking at the clouds. You can see how the wind is pushing them forward threw the sky, how the thermic is forming them, deforming them, morphing them; the clouds. How the clusters of hydrogen move towards each other, up and down, expanding and ever in a momentum, with a fluid movement…this makes me think about chaos in our existence and how we try to control that chaos, try to arrange it and &quot;put it in little boxes&quot; - but by looking at the beauty of the interaction of the clouds in the sky I realize that by letting this &quot;chaos&quot;, this &quot;disorder&quot; go his natural course we can enjoy more of the beauty of life than by constantly trying to get a grip of it.<br />17.20: Beauty &amp; enjoying. I decide to give us 50mg of MDMA each (from ItalianMafiaBrussels). I thought about it and would like the experience to be as &quot;full&quot; as possible - my GF trusts my judgement. On purpose we only take 50mg with the intention to keep on taking 50mg about every hour from now on… but as soon as we&#039;ll start feeling the first effects of the MDMA we&#039;ll change our mind: this &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; feeling is so pure, so beautiful, so perfect - that adding anything to it can only diminish our experience, the joy of it, the peace of it. We&#039;re glad we didn&#039;t take more MDMA and we&#039;ll decide not to take any more of it but instead to let the LSD feeling take over again and let it dominate our sensual world of experiences. <br />18.10: &quot;This is it&quot; - it just couldn&#039;t be better. We&#039;re outside on the meadow and at once it strikes me: &quot;this is perfection&quot;. We spend so much time and energy looking for &quot;something better&quot;, &quot;something more&quot;, &quot;something else&quot; and all this time and energy spent in this quest only annihilates the wisdom to see and understand that the moment in itself is perfection. There is no need to look further, search or seek - the wisdom lies in accepting the perfection of the moment. The wisdom, the beauty and the strength… <br />At a moment I saw a bird fly in the sky, above the trees, close to the clouds and it struck me: life, earth, the universe, existence - it&#039;s a piece of art and no artwork has a meaning without an audience to look at it, to experience it and that is one of our tasks in life, that is one of our roles in this existence: to watch and experience life, the universe, existence and to be amazed by it, to live it fully&nbsp; and in owe. <br />18.20: I&#039;m in doubt wether to take more MDMA or not, but after discussing it with my GF we decide not to do such… instead we go for a second (or third?) walk in the forest… <br />19.40: (*how to describe it*)<br />20.20: food is on the table, but we decide to go to the bedroom. Again, an intense and beautiful moment - the perfection is in it…my GF &quot;learns&quot; how to accept joy and orgasmic euphoria in a way that she&#039;s never been able to accept it before - the point where our culminated energies are loosened together is of an incredible intensity… wow. <br />20.50: now we eat, after dinner we have another beer and go outside to smoke a cigar… with the cigar we&#039;ll walk to an open place in the forest to enjoy a sunset… it starts to become colder and on the way home we have (another) discussion about gratitude and how it embellishes our life, how it nourishes our soul to be able to be grateful… Grateful to our friend that we can use his cottage for this experience, grateful to the world for letting us have this experience in it, grateful to life for giving us the possibility to grasp a part of it&#039;s meaning, grateful to the society that brings forward molecules such as LSD… Gratitude and perfection. <br />In the evening, we were sitting in the living room for a while, next to the fireplace. Not talking, but thinking, enjoying, listening to the fire. When we were sitting there in silence I could hear a buzz. You could focus on the buzz but without concentrating… if you tried to hard to hear it, it would vanish… I took me a while to realize what I was hearing…but after a while I understood this was the sound of the universe… The universe has a vibration, this vibration resonates and this resonance can be perceived as a sound. A sound that is older than life, a sound that can heal and teach. A wonderful sound that can always and everywhere be heard (we probably hear it unconsciously). A sound somewhere between a deep didjeridoo, the &quot;Ohm&quot; and a big singing bowl. <br />(the next day my GF would tell me she also heard this buzz, but she didn&#039;t realize what it was nor did she really give it a thought)<br />22.50: we&#039;re still enjoying but are becoming tired, so we decide to go up to the bedroom. There we&#039;ll see an old french movie: &quot;le sauvage&quot; while taking a little bit of ketamine (racemic K from 4sale) - trying to read the subtitles has no use... This keta mingles magnificently with the ebbing LSD-feeling. It gives us some joy, some peace, some quietness… <br />00.30: we&#039;re still tripping. Awake, but relaxed, having very nice CEV&#039;s. Not too strong, not too intense, but a pleasure to look at… You can&#039;t stop them, but you can control them almost to perfection… We are in a state between awake and asleep, between tripping balls and being sober, between what we were and what we&#039;ll be - but this very special and well-defined state of mind is, again, perfection on it&#039;s own at this moment in the journey.<br />03.00: my GF already felt asleep some time ago, I estimate that this is the time where I felt asleep as well… while listening to some beautiful meditative music (a compilation that was posted on Soundcloud and that lasts for &gt;2h). <br /><br />08.50: I wake up, quite fresh and feeling very good… I have some &quot;traces&quot; left of LSD-acitvity in my brain… very slight hints of the presence of something… something that activated so much of my brain at the same moment… I try to recoil what happened yesterday, to memorize some of the beauty and some of the insights. Writing this report helps me doing such… <br /><br />Man, o man… I knew 300μg would probably give us an intense experience - but I&#039;m so glad to have had this experience… and I&#039;m very happy I was able to buy 10 of Indica9&#039;s &quot;Glimpse of Nirvana&quot; - blotters… these ones will be kept for special occasions - once a year or less… I also have 10 of Indica9&#039;s &quot;Basel Doves&quot; - blotters (250μg) laid from the same xTal… there is no doubt about it: this xTal is amazingly pure. 300μg and NO body-load at all, 300μg and NO mind-fuck at all!!! Just perfection and gratitude… and we still have 8 of these 300μg blotters left :-)<br /><br /><br />Just 1 word of warning: this blotter is (to my opinion) not meant for newbies/unexperienced trippers, nor should it be taken lightly or unprepared, such as at a rave-party or in a crowded place. If you had the luck to get hold of some of these blotters, do use them wisely and as they were meant to be used: during the day in nature. You&#039;ll experience a moment of blissful perfection and gratitude. <br />Thank you Indica9. <br /><br /><br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />it&#039;s been about a week since we had our &quot;Glimpse of Nirvana&quot;… one of the marvelous things about LSD is that, when used in a spiritual/therapeutic/holistic way, the positive effects of the original experience can last and even improve over a period of time… When I red about this for the first time in James Fadiman&#039;s book I didn&#039;t believe it, but since we&#039;ve used a few of his suggestions while preparing our trips to Lalaland I have to say that I found it to be true: problems (health, mental, spiritual) that are &quot;worked&quot; on during a trip can be entirely solved during that trip, or&nbsp; they will not be solved during the trip but they will keep on improving for a while even after the experience. <br />What an amazing product this is! <br />

				I hope this contest doesn&#039;t judge by spelling and grammar or I&#039;m fucked.<br />Here I go<br />I was sitting in my cousins two bedroom apartment watching netflix on his X-Box360<br />He was in jail on a warrent for violation of probation. I was there , fortunately ; because if I weren&#039;t then I would never had gotten the keys and would not have been able to get in...lol. That&#039;s actually not entirely true- I used to break in quiet easily using a Jimmi whenever he would lock me out. It was on a main road through town- oddly enough, no one ever questioned it O.o. The thing about it though is that I was not on the lease and technically was not supposed to be there. I did have squatters rights at that point though(for any who don&#039;t know what that is , in some states in the US you must be handed an eviction notice for property you&#039;ve resided at unlawfully for more then thirty days. it becomes your legal residence) I digress. I was sitting there thinking of my Lost Lenor wishing it would all just end. Thinking about how I was a stalker whos love was disgusted with him. How I was fat and worthless . How I had just lost a job at a factory and couldn&#039;t even do menial labor right. about how I don&#039;t fit and how I was bad. mostly I was thinking of my promise to &#039;her&#039; that if she could not forgive me nor would I and thus would kill myself. <br />Then I saw the pill bottle. <br />It was probably a fist full , maybe 3 dozen pills , 30 MG I beleive of Welbutron (buproprion). I had no knwledge of the drug I just knew I might be able to OD on them. and that &#039;might&#039; was crucial to me because I did not want to go to hell , if there were such a place, for suicide , if that even is a damnable offense. I figured since I didn&#039;t KNOW it definitely WOULD kill me, it wasn&#039;t suicide but an accidental overdose. I think it&#039;s safe to say that I did not die-that or this is the strangest concept of an afterlife I have ever heard of D: ? I DID trip my mother luvin buns off for the first time in my life. in an empty appartment. Depressed as fuck. <br />I had tried mushrooms once or twice but never dosed high enough to even see &#039;liquid walls&#039; . LSD never came my way and DMT was just a pipe dream (rimshot). I had NO idea what to expect . If I had I might not be on probation now. This is how that afternoon and evening played out, to the best of my recollection- I had written it down in the loony bin I had subsequently ended up in , however the freshness of a story lies in its varient tellings..<br />firstly It was summer and hot as hades and I was already sedentary but the pills had a sort of tranquilizer effect. My recollection of the beginning of the trip is the worst. I know I went to my bed , layed down and tuned in to some floyd. Me and Floyd have a special bond because of my college years and the album &#039;the wall&#039;. I wasn&#039;t listening to the wall, mind you , I was listening to adam heart mother. I remember that because I really dig &#039;fat old sun&#039; , &#039;summer of sixty nine&#039; and &#039;if&#039; (if I were a swan, I&#039;d be goooone. if I were a train , i&#039;d be laaate-agaiaan.) then I notice the walls start to be all squigly as if they were moving. I had enough sense to know I was probably starting to trip. I beleive the projectile vomiting occured shortly after. it was INSANE like right out of the EXORCIST. I&#039;m not exaggurating one bit , the pressure it was coming out at literally had it flying a little less then 8 feet. Im in the tub.....tub....water....when I was crashing with my mom for that year and a half I had my own bathroom. something about long long baths for me...idk. anyways i kept trying to drink and it kept coming up. it was the first time I saw bile . it burns. god that was enough alone to make me not want to tangle with welbutripping again. eventually I fall asleep on the couch in the living room and thats where the magic starts.<br />I awake. sweating. sick. feeling really super tranquilized. I get up and sit on the other couch in front of the tv. theres yet another couch (my cousin had a couch fetish) also in the tv/living room. i hear foot steps into the kitchen. &quot;who&#039;s there?&quot;<br />foot steps back out of the kitchen&nbsp; &quot;show yourself&quot; . a body shaped indent sinks into the couch. funny thing is the indent was still there later after I came down . any ways. an indent is upon the couch and it is as if you saw a stick figure in 3-d , a short of human shape without distinct details formed in the air only be the disturbance of whats behind his translucent form. come to think of it, the extra dimensionals people see might have been taking this form. I very small part of me is convinced still that this was all real. I see him and he&#039;s got a beard, like not a zz top but a gotee that was full bodied and down to his mid neck.&nbsp; Do you , ladies and gentleman, want to know the first thing I asked this blasted contrievence of my drugged overactive imagination? <br />&quot;are you a hallucination?&quot;<br />figure shakes his head &#039;no&#039; but remains silent.<br />Well , Good enough for me! :) ( hey , come on. you&#039;ve all been there....right ? ) I never like to rule out what seems insane or impossible. I went with it.<br />then I ask- &quot;do I know you?&quot;<br />nod. <br />&quot;are you here on &#039;her&#039; behalf?&quot;<br />nod<br />&quot;are you here to kill me?&quot;<br />nod. raspy whisper filled with static &quot;yessss&quot;<br />I don&#039;t remember the exact dialogue of the following diatribe. I know we were to wait for other M . it was M who had come for me, her best friend and mentor. he was the first ghost and the messenger. <br />I sit and shoot the shit though, real casual. he&#039;s not unfriendly. I get him grinning and laughing a bit. he asks me to go fetch him His Game Informer from his room. He wasn&#039;t turning his back on me for a second. both bedrooms could be viewed from where he sat. plus I just figured it was a curtious thing to do. So I go into my cuz&#039;s bedroom first to look&nbsp; and I notice- this wasnt his stuff. I go through all the suitcases and boxes but dont find the magazine. I do find sets of girls and guys clothes. then I go to my room and everything is similar to how it was but slightly different. the computer was bigger and glowed red with those cables that have the woven mesh around them. I think it was alien ware. not mine. apparently the delusion goes that I fell asleep and miraculously L, M1 and Ma moved into the apartment and threw my stuff in the dumpster. all except for my quilt my mother made me for christmas . on the back it says &quot;made with love, for bear , from momma&quot; I guess she made them save that and didn&#039;t have the heart to throw it away. I was shortly informed that I no longer lived there and that I was actually a guest in THEIR home as of now. The landlord had approved it and they paid a large sum of cash to ensure it&nbsp; a month ago. thing is , that was plausible, because our rent wasn&#039;t paid for 3 months and we were supposed to have been out. M1 then arrives and I am escorted down the stairs (god , how didn&#039;t I break my neck on those incredibly steep steps idk) . and THUS I was outside.in the city.tripping balls. alone....except not alone- accompanied by hostile halucinations. <br />at the bottom of the steps I was informed by her fiance , m1, that I was to leave town. he kept getting really mad and intense , where as ma was more an intelectual spider then a rapid dog. since they wispered to be undetected and I was expected to pretend all was normal it was extremely difficult communicating , which is something that persisted through out the trip . I was first given the whole &quot;you don&#039;t talk to her, you don&#039;t look at her , you dont even think about her or I will kill you . &quot; and he didn&#039;t mean fighting, he meant kill. ma walks down the block then I continue &quot;what if I see her at the super market? I cant just not run into her.&quot; ma comes back and says we have to go meet some one. we go<br />were walking , to where I don&#039;t know. I do know that I wasn&#039;t about to get out of town on foot in one night. it was too late in the afternoon. so we approach a church she was going to meet us at. let me just take a moment to impress upon you that this guy was in enraged boyfriend mode, barking barely audible demands that were expected to be followed with precision if I wanted to keep alive...and I couldn&#039;t fucking see him. we got there though and the doors were locked. we were going to get me into the church for the night for sanctuary.<br />we come up to her standing there beside ma. I she gives me the following speach, paraphrased - I wished I remembered ver baten<br />she first told m1 to leave , so he resisted but eventually took a walk. ma was around near but it felt as if she was adressing me privately.<br />&quot;you don&#039;t love me&quot;<br />&quot;I tried. How do you know I don&#039;t love you?&quot;<br />&quot;because I asked for space and you wouldn&#039;t give it to me. you don&#039;t care about anyones feelings but your own. I&#039;m sorry sweety, I really am. I wish it weren&#039;t so but it is. you are simply not capable of loving . not me. not any one. &quot;<br />&lt;I know it was longer , i wish i remembered...:/ &gt; <br />needless to say , I was in tears. she was the person I vowed my death for , remember? what struck me wasn&#039;t my tears though- not that I cried a lot. what really struck me was hers. it was in her presense. in her eyes. in everything about her exhuded humanity and compassioin and sincerity. she was crying. she really was sad that I am forever alone and its because of myself and it will NEVER change. she said that too.<br />&quot;what if things change?&quot; (remember, this would have been my first time meeting her face to face)<br />&quot;they wont. its not just that they wont, even, its that they CAN&#039;T . YOU CAN&#039;T. we will NEVER (and her word punctuated with hurt) be friends, understand? &quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;that was a no go so I guess they decided I had to try to go stay with my mom. my mom wouldn&#039;t let me live with her and probably wouldn&#039;t want me to stay there. but I went in order to drop off my quilt so nothing would happen to it. while going across the fairway to the other street where my mom lived L left us and I was shoved down on the ground . face pushed to the dirt , I think forced to eat dog shit. then came with the &#039;get up&#039; &#039;get up&#039; &#039;s . and so I stand from my forced submission and listen to how worthless I am . not worthless like&#039; you fucked up&#039; but as if I really were a hated insect he wanted dead.&nbsp; he put a knife to my throat. and he asked<br />&quot;do you want to die? it would be so easy. it would be my pleasure . say it, PLEASE , say the word&quot;<br />and so you know what I said?<br />&quot;do it&quot;<br />thats how I know , though not dedicated and hardcore, I am suicidal. because truly beleiving a knife to my throat and motive of the assailent I said &#039;do it&#039;.&nbsp; <br />he pushes me away and says &quot;i would but she said you were to remain unharmed. she doesn&#039;t want you hurt. your not worth it. revenge on you isn&#039;t worth disrespecting her wishes&quot;<br />so we proceeded to my moms and went to the kitchen for food. I hadnt eatenfor a few days because we were out of food and I was ordered to get a meal and something to drink before I left. heh-....the last place I was to visit was my moms. she&#039;d have been the last person to see me before I disappeared , potentially for ever. :/ . she wasn&#039;t home, though, my sister was. I sat there eating in the kitchen , bottom door wide open (thanks, m1, my moms cat got out . &gt;:( )&nbsp; and he kept giving me threats about how he would hurt my family if I ever came back. or how he might do it anyways. playing with me like a real cocky sonofabitch . something unexpected happen. I don&#039;t take myself as having empathy of any order and I certainly dont feel special attachment to my family- but I got protective. remember, I told the dude to go ahead and slit my throat- but this wasn&#039;t MY throat. and they hadn&#039;t done shit to him . but of course I fucked with his family so he wanted to fuck with mine since he couldn&#039;t kill me. I got really angry and dark with him and eventually we left. <br />I had to find some where to stay that night. m1 was so aggrivated he was likely to kill me anyways. things were going bad.<br />ma is instructed to releive m1. m1 is told to meet L some where. thing is , L wasn&#039;t going to be there. L was worried m1 would hurt me. so i was taken to her and she led me around looking for some place to stay. thing is ma is back with m1 and has to reluctantly admit that I am with her...alone. she insisted on ma&#039;s departure, you see. saying she was safe.&nbsp; I was following her ciggerette cherry (I was sad to learn she smoked) and she had to run back to them and lie to tell them I had escaped. she told me to dive down in some bushes and I did. she rejoined her fiance and friend and led them away on a red herring chase. things took a sort of poetic twist here<br />a voice in my mind ,clear as crystal.<br />her voice.<br />Ma was a high profile international hacker/cracker for governements. thats how they got the cloaking tech they weren&#039;t supposed to have. L though managed to get her hands on something else. something experimental- some sort of ESP. To call it tech would be confusing because though it was technically binary it wasn&#039;t on a circuit board made of silicon. it was like an energy she absorbed. she didn&#039;t know quiet how it worked but it did work . that sort of explained a few tricks in lining up her cohorts to not be around me. they communicated telepathically using her as the send/receive. she knew mathew was getting closer and she told me to run.&nbsp; you NEVER tell a fatboy to run.We. Don&#039;t. Run. but she was begging me for my own lifes sake saying &#039;if you value your life ....if I mean anything to you, RUN!!!&quot; and so I bolted as fast as I can. I fell hard, got up , kept going. my shoulders still don&#039;t pop right. my god I never thought I knew how to put my all into something untill that day. running. for my life. for her. cause she cared. and here I get to stephany<br />steph was a friend of my boss I met at an afterwork drinking social thing. she was sexy and her panties, I happen to know, smell sweet as necter. She picked me up thinking i was homeless once and took me in for a day. because I wasnt ready for any kind of human relationship I intentionally fucked it up. I knew where she lived was the point and she took me in once. so I tried. I saw her friends drinking and &#039;her&#039;. but it wasn&#039;t her. it was her &#039;twin sister&#039; telling me she wasn&#039;t there. mind you , she claims that never happened and she doens&#039;t have a twin . she also claims my words were simply insane garbles and nonesense. i have to get in some how so I call upon the kindness of strangers and I knock on the neighbors door. I knock again and theres an answer. I plead with the old woman to please give me shelter, I need to get off the streets cause Im scared for my safety. I try to not say &#039;a killers after me&#039;. she says her husbands upstairs but to lay down and go right to sleep. I do. he wakes me up hollerin &#039; who are you? get the fuck out of my house&#039; and so I go and appologize and attempt to explain I had permission to be there.&nbsp; <br />according to the police report no one let me in.&nbsp; the husband came home from work and threw me out while the wife hadn&#039;t noticed me untill too late and didn&#039;t know what to say or do. also , there was no upstairs. <br />durring all this I was stopped by police because I hadn&#039;t been wearing a shirt or shoes , and they let me go twice. well now I was stopped a third time and brought in for disturbing the peace or some bullshit like that. and there I sat in the drunk tank barely able to sign my name. and guess who was there with me....<br />in my mind...<br />L.<br />we were intimate in the truest sense. she and I were united in thought and feelings. and I&#039;ll tell you what, I never thought I&#039;d do it.<br />but after listening to her chew me out rightously for many things, all things she was right about, I was getting stressed and I said it.<br />&quot;leave me alone!....just for a little while. please. get out of my thoughts and let me be by myself for a while&quot;<br />she didn&#039;t immediately leave but eventually she did. I puked in a puddle and the cops let me lay in it. i vaguely remember hearing a voice through the vent and not wanting to answer because i didn&#039;t know if it was real. it was though. i found out on later visits to county that the ladies holding tank is next to the dudes in one area and they can talk through the vents. I drifted in and out of consciousness, exhausted from running for hours . when I&#039;d come too Id see m1 who got popped too. L&#039;s dad bailing him out. M1 threatening me , reading his lips he tells he he got arrested just so wed be in gen pop together and he could kill me. I sat in jail after that for a while. it lead to more violations because of drinking and long ass probation sentance .<br />it was a hell of a ride. it showed me many things. that woman really could change me- really could make me move mountains. she made a fat boy run as fast as long as he could and thats a real start because I NEVER show determination when it means hard work.&nbsp; but I remain today much the same. Ive seen the other side and I still continued my behavior. I am unchanged. and that is why the verdict for me is death. I wish I could live life to the fullest every day - the possibilities then would be endless. but i&#039;m destined for jail and drugs and low living and id rather say fuckit and skip strait to the point. <br />anyways, thats my trip report.<br />-teddy<br />

				* Report Title: My first Experience w 25i<br />* Date Experienced: October 20th,2012<br />* Substance(s) Used &amp; Dosage(s): 25iNbome 1mg blotter<br />* Vendor Purchased From:Nawlins<br /><br />This was actually my first buying experience w Silk Road. I was nervous. I had read forums for hours researching vendors and products. 25i caught my eye because it was cheap and it seemed people could have an awesome time with it. <br />I decided to purchase 100 tabs. One for myself and the rest to resale. (no i did not tell people it was LSD!) I couldn&#039;t resist the temptation to make some easy&nbsp; money so I placed the order...<br />I waited for 3 days before I decided to check my uncles PO Box I had stole the extra key too.(if a CD happened he would have a ton of deniability) <br />OMG the parcel from the deep web had actually made its way to me! I hurried home with such a huge smile. I opened the package on the way home and couldn&#039;t help but admire the kaleidoscopic pattern on the blotter sheet. I had to be at work at 8 the next morning but I decided that taking the tab around 330 would give me plenty of time to come down, at least i thought so based on a previous encounter with a high dose of shrooms before.<br />330pm blotter placed between bottom lip and gum<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;definitely tasted worse than shrooms<br />4pm not really feeling anything<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;starting to think i got ripped off<br />415pm i feel the need to open and close my hands!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; something big is about to happen<br />5pm&nbsp; Holy Shit!!! this shit is crazy strong<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Kinda wished I had took half a tab.<br />6pm&nbsp; &nbsp;I wish the floor would stop morphing!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hate swirls unless they are on my toaster strudel!<br />7pm same<br />8pm thinking and possibly talking to myself more than i should be!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I swear im not crazy.<br />930pm im gonna lay in bed for a few hours and maybe thatl help<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;now im just talking to myself in bed, with the lights off.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for some strange reason i imagined the girl i work with had the voice of the girl in gucci manes: is you rolling and she was river stomping in the mcdonalds drive thru.<br />10pm I have to pee but there is no way im going downstairs and possibly walking past my parents with my eyeballs feeling this fucking huge!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pee out of my window!<br />1030pm I go downstairs and casually power walk to the bathroom and slam the door.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stand around in the bathroom for about 25min,(looking in mirror, taking my clothes off and putting them back on!)<br />11pm finally take a fucking shower<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;now to lay in bed<br />130am i doze in and out of sleep til about 4am until i am finally able to sleep peacefully until my alarm goes off at <br />630am time for work<br />8am-4pm bullshit work for little money.<br />5pm finalize my order after having witnessed the product arrive safely and properly testing it.<br /><br />and that is my report!<br />

				&quot;MAYBE IT WOULD HELP IF YOU SMILED&quot;<br /><br />6-29-13 12:25 am<br /><br />I put 60mg of Moon Unit&#039;s golden sun DMT in the machine.<br />The vaporizing process was very smooth. Seemed I got it all at once so I decided to put the pipe down as the room filled with machine elves. The elves, cataloging everything and playing telepathic mind-games with me were in my face and I didn&#039;t enjoy it.&nbsp; I was wishing for my bad trip assassin fairy friend would come to rid me of these entities and she appeared. More in the form of a cartoon raver girl in pigtails who looked at me and said &quot;Maybe it would help if you smiled&quot;. I did as she said and she was the only entity. The room became darkness mixed with neon patterns.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Close your eyes if you want them to stop.&quot; she said. I did and it was dark and black so I opened them again. She was gone and there they were again just processing everything in the room telepathically. I realized something my friend told me about how I had to assume an astral body that wasn&#039;t foreign to hyperspace to travel more freely.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I closed my eyes again and I was being lifted by a winged being higher and higher. I became enchanted with her gorgeous shape-shifting form. She was several beings at once flowing through each other. As I watched her form began to darken in pulses. Flashes of red and blue flashes of light as if inside of her veins. Her wings morphed into tentacles as yellows reds and blues flashed through them. the scene began to fade and I opened my eyes feeling like i had been gone forever... Felt like I had had a powernap and my lungs felt clean. 12:45 am.<br /><br />Thanks MODS for puttting this contest up. Sorry it took a while for me. I wanted something fresh and my headspace had to be properly made ready for this amazing teacher.

For this reason I spent the past week cleaning my house inside and out. Countless hours were spent mowing, weed eating, arranging potted plants, sweeping, mopping, and riding the house of as much clutter as I could manage. I had also made some arrangements to perform somewhat of a spell, or ritual. It was nothing sinister, just an expression of clearing out old clutter in an effort to rid myself of some personal burdens. I was quite proud of what I had accomplished going into this experience. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time – 4:05 – I consume a sugar cube that has two drops of JoRs TOC from the 1 dram bottle that JoR had recommended. At an estimated 80 µg per drop this dose should be approximately 160 micrograms.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About forty minutes later I have finished watering my indoor plants and have moved outside to water some flowers. I feel the effects starting to come on and attempt turning on a water faucet, but notice the screw on the handle is loose and needs to be tightened. As I move toward the house to fetch a screwdriver I am blasted back by a stinging sensation in my left chest. Apparently I had disturbed a wasp nest on the fence and they wanted me to know they did not appreciate my presence. This was an interesting way to begin my trip.&nbsp; The sting was a reminder that although beauty is inherent in all living things, our aggressive nature will prevail when an organism feels threatened.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time – 6:02 – I feel great.&nbsp; Everything is beautiful. I notice bugs and birds have tracers. This is nice to watch. I make my way inside with the intentions of recording myself in Pro-Tools, but am having issues with my condenser microphone. I decide to use another microphone instead, and record myself rambling about the obscureness of the War on Drugs as I inhale nitrous oxide from a Whipped Topping canister. My rant has left me quite amused with myself and I decide to go sit outside. The sky and clouds are very vivid with lovely colors. I keep thinking to myself that next time I will take more and that I also need to have some friends share this experience with me.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time – 8:05 – I take approximately 0.1 g of JoRs Source G MDMA. I walk out into my front yard and notice a number of birds flying around. The birds are followed with beautiful tracers. I also notice quite a few rabbits hopping about and am amazed with how fast and majestically they can hop. I decide to stand in a flower bed that has no flowers, but has recently been broken up in preparation for planting some coleus blumei. The sensation of dirt pushing threw my toes is amazing. I dig my feet deeper into the dirt until it is above my ankles and slowly inch my feet forward through the flower bed. I feel grounded and imagine what it must feel like to be a tree. I’m just smiling and laughing as people are driving past my home. I laugh at the thought that feeling the sensation of joy that has consumed my being at this point is the result of a crime I committed by consuming LSD. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time – 9:50 – I have just finished my ritual that I had prepared for earlier in the day. I believe a lot of good came from it. I realized that it can be good that things are never “good enough” because this means we always have something better to strive for. Things can always be better. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The night is winding down and I decide to watch Fantastic Planet as was recommended by a user from another online forum. The movie is strange and in a language foreign to my ears. I have a canister of Reddi-Wip in my lap waiting for the right moment to inhale its contents. Finally I sense the time is right and I inhale as much nitrous oxide as I can. I hold my breath and the effects start coming on. I think to myself that I could hold my breath forever, but choose against trying to do so and exhale my breath into a balloon. At this moment the movie seems to have reached the most insane part of the entire film. I cannot believe what I have just witnessed and repeat the phrase “What the fuck? What the fuck. . . “ over and over again. Over-all the experience was mild, but very pleasant and just what I needed. My sincerest thank you to all who make team JoR the star vendor they have become. <br />

				Report Title: FLOOMF<br />Date Experienced: 28/6/13<br />Substance(s) Used &amp; Dosage(s): B+ Mushrooms, 2g each<br />Vendor Purchased From: UKshrooms<br /><br />We&#039;re sitting on the couch in my mate Graham&#039;s house.&nbsp; Graham, Fiona and myself have just chucked two grams of mushrooms down our necks and we&#039;re waiting with bated breath for that sense of weirdness to creep into our heads.&nbsp; There&#039;s an underwater documentary playing on the TV; all sorts of weird and wonderful creatures writhe about on screen.<br /><br />I burst out laughing.<br /><br />The other two look at me strangely for a moment, then quickly realise the mushrooms have kicked in for me.&nbsp; The picture that hangs on the wall opposite grows brighter.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit like someone&#039;s turning up a dial somewhere; first there&#039;s the heightened sense of colour, then the euphoria, then everything in the living room wakes up and starts going crazy.<br /><br />There&#039;s a burst of laughter to the side of me.&nbsp; Fiona&#039;s coming up.&nbsp; We all sit and laugh at the weird creatures on the screen.<br /><br />&#039;They probably go home at night and laugh at us on the TV,&#039; someone says.&nbsp; I hope that&#039;s true.<br /><br />Graham&#039;s girlfriend is trip sitting for us.&nbsp; &#039;It&#039;s all gone a bit weird in here,&#039; she says, which is probably a fair assessment.<br /><br />We can&#039;t stop laughing.&nbsp; The carpet is being swept up by an unseen breeze.&nbsp; The vaguely psychedelic throw on the chair in the corner throbs steadily.&nbsp; I turn to Graham and watch as his hair flickers about like fire and the threads in his shirt thrash in the air.&nbsp; We watch everyday objects writhe, breathe and grow.<br /><br />I go down the corridor.&nbsp; It shrinks.&nbsp; I&#039;m a little disappointed when I end up in the toilet and not some mystic cave.&nbsp; The music untunes and retunes itself, like it&#039;s a slighly melted record.<br /><br />Hours pass.<br /><br />The visuals trail off but the euphoria&#039;s still there – I think that&#039;s maybe why, when Graham&#039;s in the toilet, I grab a wooden spoon from the kitchen, crouch on the chair behind the door and leap at him yelling &#039;SPOON ATTACK!&#039;.&nbsp; (I&#039;m ashamed to admit I&#039;m 25 years old.)<br /><br />We talk a bit, though we don&#039;t really make much sense.&nbsp; We decide that &#039;floomf&#039; really sums the world up.&nbsp; Graham reckons the man on the TV would really look good in octopus skin.&nbsp; We think about whether or not you could go into a bar and ask for &#039;a bit of moisture in a receptacle&#039;.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t expecting a crazy shamanistic experience, but at the same time I wasn&#039;t expecting something so amazingly silly.&nbsp; It&#039;s been two days since we tripped and every time I think of it – the awesome visuals, us giggling like idiots – a huge smile spreads across my face.<br /><br />I&#039;ve no idea why this stuff is illegal.&nbsp; Aside from the potential for being bruised by a surprise spoon attack, that is.
