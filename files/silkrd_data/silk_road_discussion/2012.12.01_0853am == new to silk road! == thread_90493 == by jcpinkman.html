				I clicked this thread wholly expecting to be left feeling resentful at newbies <br /><br />But then, you surprised me. :&#039;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I shake you warmly by the hand. :D<br /><br />I mean, technically we shouldn&#039;t introduce ourselves here, there&#039;s a thread for it, but FUCK IT, you&#039;re someone willing to put the time in to your SR experience. I promise you&#039;ll get much more out of reading/lurking than we could write out in a few posts. It&#039;ll get you up to speed and in the community quick <br /><br /><br />Welcome, and hope you get what you want out of this place :) !!

				I&#039;m with her^^^^. When I joined a year and some months ago, I spent about a week just lurking around the forums.&nbsp; And I am the furthest thing from a tech savvy person.&nbsp; I just watched and listened to what others were saying and doing.&nbsp; And learned as much as I possibly could.&nbsp; Btc, pgp, Tor....it was like a foreign language.&nbsp; But I persisted.&nbsp; I sent test encrypted emails to other forum members.&nbsp; I made sure I knew everything I could about the process. And then I made my first order, and when I got that package in the mail, I was just beside myself.<br /><br />So, good for you!!&nbsp; The answers are all here....you just need to do a little work to find them.&nbsp; But the payout is SOOO worth it.<br /><br />Feel free to PM if you have any questions.<br /><br />

				I first started the way you are OP.&nbsp; I feel that you gain a better understanding of the system if you venture through it yourself.&nbsp; Good for you not being a lazy ass newbie who can&#039;t even use the search feature and make redundant post that have been answered hundreds of times.&nbsp; Welcome to the Road and if you need something I will try to help.

				Welcome &amp; have fun!&nbsp; This is an amazing community - I love it here.&nbsp; If you need someone to practice PGP just hit me up. Once again, WELCOME!&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />P.S. EDIT:&nbsp; There is SO much information here it can be overwhelming.&nbsp; Suggest starting with the &quot;Sticky Posts&quot;, the ones at the top of each page. They&#039;re pink &amp; they have thumb tack or push pin icons.&nbsp; You can also use the white Search button at the top of each page too but it&#039;s a little finicky.&nbsp; Also look for a thread called .... SR FAQ Compilation .... by member Delta 11&nbsp; <br /><br />:D

				See, now someone like this I don&#039;t mind helping.<br /><br />The two most important things you need to learn are how to get bitcoins safely and how to use PGP. Bitcoins will depend on where you live, there will be different exchanges and ways of going about it. However, Bitinstant has been the most popular method for a few months. A lot of people send their coins through several ewallets, but I recommend using a proper mixing service or two.<br /><br />For PGP, if you&#039;re on Windows, here&#039;s a good starting guide:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br /><br />(Although a few experts on the forum recommend using GPG4USB instead of PGP4Win, but you can switch later. That guide is good for a start.)<br /><br />Once you have your keys, you can ask someone to send you encrypted messages in PGP Club, which is here<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938.0<br /><br />Your vendor should take care of discreet packaging, you just need to pick a shipping location and PGP encrypt that address when you send it to the vendor.<br /><br />Read the reviews. Many of them will tell you about the quality of the product, packaging methods, etc. I&#039;d say spend a good week just reading reviews and settling on some vendors you want to try.
