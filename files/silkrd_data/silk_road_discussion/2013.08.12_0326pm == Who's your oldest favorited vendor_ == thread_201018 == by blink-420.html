				My first ever favorite was Sour Diesel Man, but I removed his link after he disappeared. This leaves Brutusk in the bottom slot, but he hasn&#039;t been on in over two months, though his vendor page is still there. So if I remove Brutusk, that would leave Humboldts Finest at the bottom. Christy Nugs obviously looks like a primo vendor, but I never saw any reason to become a fan since she won&#039;t sell to anyone with less than eight months.

				LunaC is the first vendor I favorited and many after that.&nbsp; She just sells rx pills but her prices and stealth are amongst the best.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I read through this thread I noticed that a lot of vendors from before that you guys liked are now gone.&nbsp; What happened to those vendors?&nbsp; Can we only speculate?&nbsp; Did they get nabbed or was the heat too much or did they get out while they were ahead or what?&nbsp; Seems somewhat concerning.&nbsp;

				Pharmville and 3Dames! I still remember the day I opened my mailbox to find a package containing 50 xanax and 50 klonopin. My life was forever changed, haha!
