				I haven&#039;t seen a thread on this maybe someone else made one and I overlooked it.<br /><br />About a week maybe two weeks before the seizure of SR I received a message on SR from a user named &quot;VENDOR SUPPORT&quot; all caps not &quot;Vendor Support&quot;(actual SR vendor support)<br /><br />The message stated that Homeland Security, FBI, DEA are about to seize SR and take it down. The message said SR is being backed up at an alternative site and gave an .onion address. It also said to move all your bitcoins to the backup bitcoin address provided. I disregarded it as spam/scam at the time and promptly deleted the message. I believe two days late I got a message from Vendor Support saying disregard the scam attempt. <br /><br />Did anyone else get this message??? Others must have.<br /><br />Most likely a Fed, or man on the inside, SR mod/employee/Fed wrote the message to scam more bitcoins before the sight was taken down! Maybe to gain info as well.<br /><br />Another question. Did anyone who got the message go to the .onion link or put any coins in the bitcoin address in that message???<br /><br />Please reply!

				The message WAS a scam. It was aimed at seizing/tracking bitcoins so as to identify vendors.<br /><br />

However, I will be requiring PGP to be used in all communication, no exceptions.<br /><br />If you need help learning PGP, take a look at Pine&#039;s tutorials on the security forums, access while you still can! :) It looks daunting but is very easy once you&#039;ve got the hang of it. When generating your key, ensure it is 4096 bit instead of the standard 2048.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				I didn&#039;t get that, but sounds like a scam.<br />As a vendor, I got a LOT of scam messages.<br />From &quot;DPR&quot; or &quot;Silk Road Admins&quot; or &quot;The Silk Road&quot;, etc.<br />Scammers tried their best to exploit everything they could out of everyone.<br />

				Eerily enough, a couple weeks ago I saw a comment on a post on the SR Reddit where someone was trying to warn people that the feds had compromised the SR server and that a shutdown was imminent. I thought it was just a troll, and his comment had been downvoted so many times that it was no longer visible without manually viewing it. The thing is, the rest of the guy&#039;s posts were normal comments, no signs of troll activity.
