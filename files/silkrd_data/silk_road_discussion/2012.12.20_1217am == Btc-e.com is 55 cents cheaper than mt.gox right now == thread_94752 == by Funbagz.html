				I use bitinstant to send to btc-e more often than Mt.Gox.... and often it is quite cheaper + the added fact that Mt.Gox charges up to .6% fee and btce charges .2<br />

				Do you have to prove your identity on btc-e? <br /><br />I was going to use mtgox but they want me to scan an ID and that&#039;s just too much work IMO, but btc-e.com hasn&#039;t mentioned anything PLUS they&#039;re less expensive.. I have never used an exchange program I just have bitinstant do it, but their exchange rate is much higher than the exchange sites so I was thinking of trying out btc-e.com just am not sure how good it is.?

				I&#039;ve used btc-e several times. You can have bitinstant send directly to btc-e and from there you can trade dollar for coin. It really is cheaper.

				In the interest of cheaper.. is it better? What swim uses has worked, and while its not cheap. its fast. And time is money, bitches! ;)<br /><br />BTC-E WIKI:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BTC-E<br /><br />History<br />The site was first announced on July 17, 2011[3] with test mode trading. Live trading began on August 7, 2011[4].<br />On July 31, 2012 the service reported a security incident in which halted trading and caused financial loss to the exchange. The exchange says it covered losses from reserves and trading resumed in a matter of hours[5].<br />On August 2, 2012 the service added an API for trading, but still lacks an API for bitcoin withdrawals (something offered by every major exchange). On August 20, 2012 the service added BTC/RUR and USD/RUR trading markets. On September 3, 2012 the service added numerous RUR deposit and withdawal methods as well as more USD deposit and withdrawal methods[6].<br /><br />Criticism<br />BTC-E has been known to freeze accounts and steal their balances from even well-known community members on their own accord, without any judicial ...
