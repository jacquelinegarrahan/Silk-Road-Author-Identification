				hey there<br /><br />so the last time I bought something here was around february. one bitcoin was about €4 back then, now they&#039;re at 9€, but one xtc pill is still about 0,7 to 1 bitcoin... just like before.<br />does this mean SR won&#039;t adjust the pricing to the current value of bitcoins? why?<br /><br />thanks in advance for your help !

				I was actually wondering this as well, it would be nice if all the vendors would hedge their bulk prices to street prices based off of erowid ETC.<br /><br />But I guess if you are the only one with a dank listing, and no competitors, then of course you will sell it for as much as you can get.

				Its up to the seller to set their own pricing.<br />With that said, there are 2 different ways to price your products.<br /><br />Sellers guide says:<br />They can be priced in constant Bitcoins, or constant US Dollars. If you choose to peg your listings to the dollar, your prices will change dynamically in accordance with the exchange rate between the two currencies. When the Bitcoin appreciates, your prices will fall. When it depreciates, they will rise, so no matter what, you will get the same dollar value for your item. We recommend that you peg your prices to the dollar.

				What would be the disadvantage to having SR implement and automatic price adjustment based on the market rate of the BTC?&nbsp; For example a vendor thinks his dank should be $50 an 8th, so he lists it at ($50 / ($13.36 per BTC)) = 3.74 BTC.<br /><br />Now tomorrow the BTC depreciates further compared to the $ so that now 1 BTC = $20.&nbsp; The true market value of his listing would be <br />3.74 BTC * ($20 per BTC) = $74.8.&nbsp; So we have been forced to pay essentially 50% more for his product because of the currency fluctuation than it&#039;s worth.&nbsp; And BTW this is happening currently, and is not insignificant because the BTC is currently rising steadily compared to the $.<br /><br />Why can&#039;t SR automatically normalize prices based on the market value of the BTC as tied to Mt.Gox continuously, so that the price for the chronic automatically updates to 2.5 BTC ($20 * 2.5 = $50) in the purchasing window?<br /><br />I mean this way no one loses right?&nbsp; The goods are bought and sold for the exact price the vendor sets.&nbsp; The buyer pays the fair market value the vendor set, and the vendor receives the value he originally placed his goods for.&nbsp; All is well and good.<br /><br />I welcome attacks on my proposal as I&#039;m sure I left out or am missing something somewhere.......<br /><br />

				Well then I just wasted 10 minutes of my life.<br /><br />So if it&#039;s listed at 1 BTC ($10/BTC) and I come back 10 minutes later and the BTC has skyrocketed ($100/bTC) The good will be listed as 0.1 BTC?<br /><br />???

				Yep. Change whether you want bitcoins or dollars displayed go to &#039;settings&#039;.<br /><br />Would be good to see a little &#039;bitcoin&#039; or &#039;dollar&#039; icon next to each vendors pricing. So we know what price is it pegged to, without having to check back each day or two.
