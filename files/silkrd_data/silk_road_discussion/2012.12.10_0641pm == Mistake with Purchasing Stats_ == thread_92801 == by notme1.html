				Hi all, <br /><br />Hope you are good - apologies if this has been covered, just did a quick search but could not find anything and a bit short on time.<br /><br />Just saw my buyer stats:<br />Total transactions: 14<br />Total spent: ฿166.27<br />Refund rate: 17.45%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br /><br />Now I have only had 1 refund (100%) so surely this number is wrong? <br />Even done on value does not add up.<br /><br />Have emailed SR admin but wondered if anyone else has had same problem or has an explanation? <br /><br />The 1 refund I got also included multiple extensions, not sure if this might affect the stats?<br /><br />Very frustrating as this refund was last order and now looks as if I am a shit buyer!!!! my 0% has gone to 17.45% and am being questioned on this!!!<br /><br />Many thanks for any help<br /><br />NM1

				I&#039;ve personally not run into this issue, but I&#039;ve also never had to have a refund processed so I&#039;m probably not the best person to ask.&nbsp; I&#039;d wait on SR&#039;s admins hopefully they should be able to either give you an explanation or get the percentage sorted.

				17.45% out of<br />฿166.27 = ฿29.014115<br /><br />is that about the amount was refunded to you? <br /><br />* didnt test for myself as i didnt refund but it seem likeley that the % are from the total spent

				Thanks for the help - was for about 22, that is what is puzzling me - anyhow got this response from SR admin, seems like it is a bit of a riddle! :<br /><br />SR Support &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes into consideration many things, not just the number of refunds, but also the amount, etc. Its kind of complicated.<br /><br />~SR Support<br /><br />So there you have it, like that difficult relationship &#039;it&#039;s kind of complicated&#039; ;)<br /><br />x

				No good bud, but if you keep spending you can actually make the refund rate return back to zero? (I think)

				The refund rate takes into account two main aspects. The first is how much was refunded, the second was how long ago was it refunded (more like how much money was spent since the refund). Your refund rate is really high right now because you were just refunded. Make a few more purchases, spend a few more hundred or thousand or tens of thousands more dollars and your rate will drop down to the low single digits eventually. Don&#039;t stress too much over it and just work on getting it down.
