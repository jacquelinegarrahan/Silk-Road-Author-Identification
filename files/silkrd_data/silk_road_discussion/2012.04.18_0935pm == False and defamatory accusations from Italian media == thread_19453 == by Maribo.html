				Hey guys, beware of a member with username &quot;dakon&quot;. He is working (or has worked) for the Italian press in particular the &quot;Corriere Della Sera&quot; and has published a piece saying that the Silk Road is mainly for &quot;criminal and TERRORIST organizations&quot; that sells drugs, weapons and paedo-pornographic material. I accept the drugs and the weapons, but I never came across any paedo material. They highlight the word &quot;young&quot; to suggest this. And coming from the Italians who has one of the most corrupt and undignified governments this world has ever seen!&nbsp; &gt;:(

				One mans terrorist is another mans cup of coffee.<br /><br />Plus Italy is a nation which produced guys in stylish suits who offered &#039;protection&#039; from the &#039;bad guys&#039; who turned out to be the actual men in the stylish suits and quick witted repartee combined with sociopath-like violent behavior. <br /><br />So maybe the Italian media ought to worry more about Pete the Mustache and Johnny Two Smiles and a million other Italian gentlemen in jogging suits or stolen designer suits.<br /><br />As for terrorists, I guess its possible one might buy a gun online and kill people.<br /><br />But its likely that any up and coming terrorist will get a gun either legally in their own nation or off someone in the local gang or mafia. <br /><br />There are websites which deal in guns. you can order from China or Eastern Europe. You can go there and bring them back. People do this and in every town in Europe there will be someone who can get you a gun. You are 3 people away from that. You know someone who knows someone. <br /><br />Bees frighten me more than terrorists. The quality of terrorism has gone way down the pan of late. I remember the days of real terrorists like Fu Man Chu the evil guy on TV. It was real - right? We caught him I guess. Evil bastard used to get everyone! Maybe journalists should go for Fu Man Chu who was Chinese as I recall. Hated Americans. And Anyone really. Gives me the fear just thinking about it. But we done lots of LSD and forgot about it. Feared my own reflection then but grew to love it again. <br /><br />So what were we talking about?<br /><br />Were is my joint?&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Honey!
