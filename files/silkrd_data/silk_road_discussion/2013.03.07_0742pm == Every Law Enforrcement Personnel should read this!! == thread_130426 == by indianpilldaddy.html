				I am just having a thought that why is the Law Enforcement(LE) so hell bent on capturing drug related criminals. What about the real criminals like rapists, murderers, serial killers, robbers, even fraudsters.<br />What is wrong with distributing cannnabis which is 100% natural and there have been ZERO deaths with cannabis. Its just something which is illegal but it doesn&#039;t harm anybody. It is as bad as selling a cigarette.<br />I think every matter should be looked upon in a very detailed manner.<br />Even selling prescription drugs should be looked upon differently as it is they are all legal and it is the doctors who prescribe them and start causing dependence. By the way why are prescription drugs so expensive in America when they are so cheap here in India???<br />It is the same stuff that&#039;s put in. I think you guys should rather arrest the REAL criminals - the owners of&nbsp; these pharamaceuticle companies.<br />Give it a thought!!

				A lot of LE personnel seem to take their job way too seriously. Two officers followed a friend of mine for 30 minutes, tracking him down inside of a large hotel. The horrible crime?<br />Crossing the railroad tracks. <br /><br />The local PD has begun stationing officers at the entrances to the parks in my area to enforce the &quot;Parks closed after 11&quot; rule. These officers literally sit there and do nothing, instead of patrolling. <br /><br />LE apparently has severe issues with what ACTUALLY constitutes a legit crime.

				As JediKnight said - the only reason LE spends any time at all on enforcement of soft drug laws (like cannabis) is because it is still illegal in most jurisdictions. If called upon to enforce the law they have no choice but to do so. <br />The real question is why we as a society allow such a distraction to take away policing resources from where they&#039;re really needed. <br /><br />Having said that, I also think SelfSovereignty has a good point - just because it&#039;s natural doesn&#039;t mean its &#039;good&#039;. Cyanide, arsenic and other edible poisons all exist naturally. I wouldn&#039;t eat wild mushrooms without knowing what I was doing. Of course I wouldn&#039;t outlaw them eithe

Just because something is illegal does not mean it is wrong, and yet they seem to treat as such. Case in point, the railroad incident with my friend. Many officers also seem to either lack common sense in the first place or be in law enforcement simply to screw other people over as much as possible. One of the cities north of me is notorious for having an over staffed PD that glories in ripping apart peoples rights as much as possible. <br /><br />I am reminded very strongly of many Nazi war criminals who were &quot;just following orders&quot; and &quot;had no choice&quot;. Some cops are not that bad, they will let many small things go because they disagree with the silliness of many minor laws, but others...

				You are just talking about your community here mate. I am talking about on a global scale. I&#039;ll tell you something in my country cops do drive around looking for crooks to bust.

I think he&#039;s somewhat intelligent if not very naive. He throws around a lot of grown-up words like &#039;Nazi&#039; as if he has actually lived under a true fascist regime. Funny though - he really believes that any form of government is evil, (calls believers in government &#039;statists&#039;) but thinks that somehow we can magically live amongst each other without any laws at all. If we need protection from each other we&#039;ll just hire security agencies to enforce our own beliefs over everyone else (although what happens when the security companies collaborate and demand &#039;protection&#039; money from us all). He hates any form of Law Enforcement (LE), in fact he calls for their execution upon the realization of a libertarian society. Basically he&#039;s the kind of dude who has has been living in a bubble of extreme idealist isolation. Pol Pot, Stalin and Mad Max would all agree with his radical reasoning.&nbsp;

				On the whole &quot;police are just doing their job thing&quot;: Sure, nazi exterminators were just doing their job, but that is an unfair comparison. They were likely facing something more consequential than simply losing their job, which is what the cops are facing at worst. The thing that makes them &quot;just doing their job&quot; sicken me is that they are choosing to sell out their morals (if they have any) just so that they wouldn&#039;t be unemployed for a stretch. C&#039;mon. Money corrupts when people choose it over moral values. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=130426.msg898648#msg898648">Quote from: XXXotica on March 14, 2013, 01:33 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I mean, you have to think about what kind of person would want to be a cop to begin with.

Which kind of makes my last point moot, seeing as those ego inflated authority addicts are totally devoid of any sort of morality or ability to see outside of their own perspective.
