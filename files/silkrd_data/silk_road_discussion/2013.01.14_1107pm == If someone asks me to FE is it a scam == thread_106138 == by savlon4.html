				Bitcoins should come saturday or sunday. I am hoping to make my first purchase then but since i havent made a purchase before it seems I have to FE as most acid (What I want to buy) dealers (Or vendors in general) wont accept noobs not FEing. That said everywhere I look all I&#039;m seeing is.<br />DONT OPERATE OUT OF ESCROW!<br />NEVER FE!<br /><br />When I read things like that it kinda gets me worried. I dont want to be ripped off or scammed. Iv decided to go with YingYang as my vendor when I do make a purchase due to his good stats. Am I likely to get ripped off?

				Whoever you choose for a vendor, you should spend some amount of time here to see if others have written reviews about them.<br />Use the search function and see what pops up.&nbsp; I know a lot of vendors require FE for new buyers.&nbsp; What I have seen suggested is to make some small purchases first to get your stats up.&nbsp; Or find a vendor that doesn&#039;t require FE.&nbsp; (I know that is easier said than done in some cases.)<br /><br />Hops this helps.

				Generally FE is not a scam in most cases but it&#039;s the second easy way to scam on the site,never give up your escrow option, it was designed into the site to protect you, bypassing it makes you look quite a fool because SR will not help anyone that bypasses escrow early. It says on the orders page all finalization are final and they mean it 110%.<br />Seems FE potential, is derived from eager beaver syndrome.Vendors invented the finalization early option anyway. They have what sounds like some reasonable answers as to why to FE but they are all unneeded and can be done with out.<br />FE means you freely decide to give your currency away no matter what the outcome is, if this is fine with you FE but it losing the currency and getting no order bothers you at all don&#039;t do it.<br />also you can buy porn for like 0.04btc for stat building if most vendors wont look into your stats enough to see you spent less than a btc for good enough stats to not have to FE. <br />I&#039;ve never FE and guess what, I ve never been ripped off or scammed. There is always tomorrow and a new vendor that will pop up, any day could a day someone joins that wont require FE so don&#039;t be so eager to hope on the FE must wagon. It&#039;s a myth. If you feel you must FE then you are doing it wrong. What&#039;s that saying about butterflies and narwhals?<br /><br />X)<br />nomad
