				I personally think that DPR is one person but im sure he dose not run the website by him self, and if he dose he is doing a bloody good job, Especially with how much traffic and the current ddos&#039;s attacks, would be ALOT of work for one person!

				Given the huge influx of new users to this marketplace I guess I understand why this question came up..<br /><br />DPR is short for Dread Pirate Roberts, a fictional character in the novel The Princess Bride. It is revealed during the course of the story that Roberts is not one man, but a series of individuals who periodically pass the name and reputation to a chosen successor. Everyone except the successor and the former Roberts is then released at a convenient port, and a new crew is hired.<br /><br />IF you care to look back at all the posts made by DPR you can easily see that is what is occurring here and I suspect that it has happened at least 3 times since the start of SR, possibly more.<br /><br />If the current DPR knows that he is deathly ill or something of like, he will get off at the next &quot;port&quot; and pass the eye-patch (dunno if he had one in the story, just like word play.. English majors have dull jokes) to someone else.. If he suddenly dies, I&#039;m sure there is a admin here or close enough that they know his/her real identity and will take care of it. If not, some one, some where will know what to do eventually..<br /><br />In short, if SR is still necessary 100 yrs from now, DPR will still be running the show no matter what..

				I think we would see a collapse of this market and everyone scrambling for a new position and status. <br />The deck would get shuffled and a new game would begin. <br /><br />When you have a centralized power figure, it&#039;s usually like that for security reasons. <br /><br />I&#039;d be willing to bet that DPR never gets older, never dies.&nbsp; He&#039;s likely a fictional character like a mascot.&nbsp; It&#039;s the ultimate security tactic.&nbsp; Make everyone think its a single person to chase, blame, sue and take all the fall for it.&nbsp; Think about it .&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a team of people who will all pass the buck if it goes down.&nbsp; It was this guy called DPR who did it. He was master mind. We are just employees and here to work innocently.<br /><br />Just a baked theory.&nbsp; &nbsp;Until we see a photo or something.&nbsp;

				Wishful thinking.&nbsp; Its not a registered Corporation, so there are no rules or laws when it changes hands.&nbsp; <br />It will be brutality or brains that will take the reins. <br /><br /><br />Uncle Ben&#039;s and Aunt Jemima aren&#039;t real people.&nbsp; They were created to help sell the product and for people to relate to the person.&nbsp; A hero to look up to.&nbsp; Its the perfect marketing.&nbsp; Make it look like its just one guy who works really hard without caring about getting paid, just does it for the love of serving people?&nbsp; I&#039;m not convinced these kind of people can&#039;t sustain themselves for too long if they even exist.&nbsp; &nbsp; They will burn out or get sick or make mistakes.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Can you imagine Uncle Ben cooking up a pot of rice for billions of people?&nbsp; As if.&nbsp; I think there is much more than meets the eye, but it doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; We are served well.&nbsp; He is a fantastic leader.&nbsp; In the end it all works.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I like DPR.&nbsp; Nothing can replace him.&nbsp; A replacement will always be accused of being an informant, LE, or mafia.&nbsp; Nobody will ever be trusted with all that.&nbsp; Its too much power to hand over to anyone is not family.&nbsp; Central power is inherited or taken, but never given.<br /><br />Look at competing market sites.&nbsp; They are all accused of this and that, until they get their very own hero/spokesman that everyone can admire.&nbsp; Until then, they are never going to get trust from people.&nbsp; They are just mysterious.<br />

				I seriously doubt the market will collapse unless somebody shuts it down. Many of the vendors here have long time customers and vending here is simply much safer than dealing in real life.<br /><br />On top of that, people who buy from SR almost always do it because they don&#039;t have the RL connections, or the RL people they know can&#039;t match SR&#039;s prices.<br /><br />If you really want to get into it, I would say Marijuana is the biggest thing holding up SR. Weed is obviously going to be cheaper in States where it is legalized/medicinalized due to a greater availability, and as a result people from non-medical states use this site. I would be willing to gamble to say 60-70+% of SR traffic comes from marijuana seekers. So unless weed is legalized everywhere at once, I don&#039;t think SR will be falling anytime soon unless someone takes it down.... even if bitcoin crashes out of control, people still need their drugs.<br /><br />That is my opinion. I&#039;m pretty confident DPR has thought about this issue before.

What are trying to imply here, sir? LOL.<br /><br />I hope he doesn&#039;t die, that would suck. SR has replaced Facebook, CNN, and nearly anything else I used to spend time with online.<br />In half seriousness, if he did pass away .. then fuck! That would suck, HARD. How would anyone even know?? He rarely posts here. People wouldn&#039;t even figure it out till he was absent for weeks. Hopefully he&#039;s got a contingency plan in place.<br /><br />Maybe infighting would break out amongst the staff as to who&#039;d come to power. Like different factions would form and they&#039;d DDoS the fuck out of each other and fight it out on TOR. Inigo would head one, SSBD would head another, Scout would head one, the new guy Libertas would command a little faction.<br /><br />But this is all humor. In seriousness, knowing DPR to be a very intelligent man with foresight.. I would say he&#039;s got some kind of a plan. Some trusted technical savvy libetertarian person he knows is going to get a sealed letter with a login/password to the gates of Valhalla. That and a few hundred million dollars in Bitcoins..<br /><br />

				Watch the Princess Bride. As stated, Dread Pirate Roberts stays on board the ship as first mate for a voyage and calls his successor Dread Pirate Roberts until departing, thus convincing the crew he is DPR.<br /><br />Therefor, there is an established line of succession, or at least a very good one.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t think of a more suitable pseudonym. <br /><br />In the line of succession, since Inigo is both in the movie and an admin here, my theory is the site would be given to him, and he takes on the DPR role.

Cool thing to ponder over. I&#039;m under the assumption its a close-knit group of friends who conceived of and launched the idea and most likely already had plans for lines of succession although who knows if they went as far as to thinking what would happen if one passed but I would assume they prepared for if one, few, or all gets incarcerated.

				There could also be a &quot;deathswitch&quot; in place -- some system where if the DPR account doesn&#039;t respond for a set period of time, the login credentials are automatically passed to a next-in-line. Systems like this are often used to pass on a will.

				Well I think the forum DPR is just one guy, all his posts sound pretty similar. Unless this &quot;elite team&quot; has the exact same principles, ideas, and writing style, the forum DPR is one man/woman. But obviously there&#039;s a team that runs the whole thing. Someone has to be in charge of that team. I can&#039;t find the post now, but I remember DPR saying something like &quot;I&#039;m the only one that has access to all the BTC accounts on the site. I don&#039;t trust anyone else with those accounts.&quot; I believe that. If more than one person had access to those accounts, it would only take one of them being an asshole to bring the whole site crashing down. If the guy who posts as DPR on the forums is the only one that has it, I trust him because he&#039;s clearly shown that he has our best interests in mind.<br />&nbsp;<br />I do wonder though exactly what happens to former DPRs, and how exactly they find their replacement. I imagine the process is very selective, because you know that if you give it to the wrong guy, he could end up pulling off the biggest BTC scam of all time and escape with millions of BTC easily. I really like the current DPR, so hopefully when the site is passed on to the next guy, he&#039;s just as good as the one I have now.<br /><br />If I could personally know the solution to any mystery in the history of mankind, I would seriously want to know DPR&#039;s identity. I have no idea what someone like him would even do for a living, since he&#039;s making over $2 million a year in commission. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the site was run by a cartel or mafia of some kind, and DPR just happens to be the head. There&#039;s so much mystery surrounding the site. Obviously it&#039;s better off that way!

It is revealed during the course of the story that Roberts is not one man, but a series of individuals who periodically pass the name and reputation to a chosen successor. Everyone except the successor and the former Roberts is then released at a convenient port, and a new crew is hired.<br /><br />IF you care to look back at all the posts made by DPR you can easily see that is what is occurring here and I suspect that it has happened at least 3 times since the start of SR, possibly more.<br /><br />If the current DPR knows that he is deathly ill or something of like, he will get off at the next &quot;port&quot; and pass the eye-patch (dunno if he had one in the story, just like word play.. English majors have dull jokes) to someone else.. If he suddenly dies, I&#039;m sure there is a admin here or close enough that they know his/her real identity and will take care of it. If not, some one, some where will know what to do eventually..<br /><br />In short, if SR is still necessary 100 yrs from now, DPR will still be running the show no matter what..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Exactly what I was thinking brother.. DPR is a team, a large group who are never DPR for longer than any given time. <br /><br />Brilliant novel though, I suggest everyone has a read&nbsp; :)

				Having some major lolz at this dumbass thread. OP, c&#039;mon dude, what are you doing posting this BS? And the feeble minded noob speculation is laughable.<br /><br />You know what I think? I think he really is a fantastical pirate, and the SR server is on an old galleon sailing the seven seas. Aside from running the site and fending off ddos attacks, he also takes time out to battle other ships and plunder their treasure. He is a proficient sword fighter, dressed all in black, and wears a mask to disguise his identity, which is unbeknown even to his crew.. Yeah, fuck off.<br /><br />DPR is not gonna die any time soon. And before that were even an issue, he would retire. And none of you would be any the wiser. There is not going to be a public service announcement to inform anyone of anything going on in his private life. And you have no right to ask these dumbass fucking questions in the first place.<br /><br />A committee will be formed?? You are an idiot. SR is essentially a privately owned business. What the owner and/or investors decide to do is up to them. It&#039;s not a democracy. As with any privately owned business, they are not required to report any information on the internal workings of the &quot;company&quot; to the public.<br /><br />What happens when the OP dies? Nothing. No one cares. SR ticks along as usual, only with one less dumbass noob to ask stupid and offensive questions.<br /><br />Regards, GE

DPR isn&#039;t even a person, he&#039;s a Yoda type creature but he&#039;s a SPACE pirate lives in the SR server/space ship near the moon and the current ddos attacks are from martians. But that&#039;s what he does all day every day, he fights off aliens in space so the humans can have their drugs. WE teh internetz should hold a state funeral with an open coffin when he dies and then form a committee vote for either Harry Potter or the cute guy from Avatar in the blue suit to take over. <br /><br />This is the stupidest thread on the forums ever OP. Thanks for giving me some comic relief you tool.
