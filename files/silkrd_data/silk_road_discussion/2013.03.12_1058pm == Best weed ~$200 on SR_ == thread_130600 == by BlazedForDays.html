				Hey fellow Road travelers,<br /><br />I have ~$200 worth of bitcoins right now, and I&#039;m looking to buy a good O.<br /><br />Now I understand I&#039;m not looking at AAA bud, but what&#039;&#039;s the best stuff in this price range in your opinions?<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

No, but very few will know the $100 difference,even if it&#039;s outdoor. Except the fussy pot heads we have collected here ;)

				Can report that I have tried product (grams or 1/8s) from the vendors who sell $200 ounces and was majorly (underline that please - majorly) disappointed with the quality.&nbsp; Then again, I&#039;m a chronic smoker w/ high tolerance.&nbsp; If your tolerance is low, you might be happy with the buzz of $200 bud.<br /><br />Have also noticed a decrease in price for primo nugs since the 1st of the year.&nbsp; My favorite vendors were selling ounces for around $320 in December &amp; January. Prices are now below $300 - at around $270-$280 for some of them now. <br /><br />I would be more inclined to spend the $280 for an ounce of premium or to spend $150 +/- for a 1/2 ounce of primo.&nbsp; I&#039;m done sampling garbage weed to save a couple of bucks but weed is so personal - tastes vary so widely. Good luck with your search!

				I know you guys are fussy. I have no problem with that. Everything you have stated is true.<br />That being said that Blue Dream is a deal. OP only has $200, and wants an OZ. Huge smelly bag of lime green buds.<br /><br />No worry it will be sold out soon;)<br />We are all enjoying it here, no complaints at all.<br /><br />
