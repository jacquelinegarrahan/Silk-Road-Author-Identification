				Fucking sucks that they got DPR. The mans a legend i hope we can some how get a back up of SR or access to our vendor or buyer accounts? The forum mods have been very quiet during this period. <br /><br />Im sure DPR has enough money for a good lawyer but either way I think we will all be happy to donate towards helping him face difficult times

				It&#039;s unlikely that if this is a real site seizure that anyone&#039;s going to be getting anything back, we&#039;ll have to wait and see what happens over the next few days.<br /><br />It could feasibly be a hack in an attempt to massively lower the BTC price.

				I wouldn&#039;t count on seeing a single coin back, this is the real fucking deal.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that this is not the original DPR. Whoever the original, super-libertarian / anarcho DPR was, I guarantee his ass is already long gone the second he caught a whiff of this. Probably still has food cooking in the microwave at his house, I&#039;m assuming he left that fast.

				lost 36 btc in escrow and our orders we sent out. nothing is coming back if this is real, cut your losses and go elsewhere like bmr. The real DPR left 2 years ago, the new guy was not the same person whether it be a sting, or he sold it or just sold out. it was not &quot;him&quot; and everybody knew it. but regardless that name sounds fake, and this looks fake as hell. doubt it is but the fbi is known for shitty graphics, look at LR when it went down, this looks Photoshopped and is just not the same.
