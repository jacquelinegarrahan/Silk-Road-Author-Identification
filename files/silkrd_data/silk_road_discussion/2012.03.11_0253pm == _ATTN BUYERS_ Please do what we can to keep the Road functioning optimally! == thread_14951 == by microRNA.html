				To all my fellow buyers traversing the Road, this is a personal request with the intention to make the most out of the recently impaired ability for us to discern a a vendors reliability. These recent feedback changes have been unfortunate and severely hinder our ability to accurately determine the quality the vendor and especially individual products quality. 20 feedbacks to sum up an entire vendor... ludicrous! The feedback and actually knowing what you were getting was in my opinion one of the things that made SR worth the extra money but now even more uncertainty has been added to the process. I understand the point is security and support most of the changes for this reason, but if someone could explain how only providing the most 20 recent feedbacks when up to three hundred transactions are shown is covering anything up?? Now I question the usefulness of the feedback system and even the ability to warn other of scamming. However, it seems this is what DPR has settled on since it has been a few days sadly. Since the change I am much more hesitant to try unfamiliar vendors and products. The help all of your fellow buyers, please listen to my plea:<br /><br />***To make the most out of this shitty feedback system: <br />1) If you finalize early, after clicking on finalize, DO NOT click &quot;leave feedback&quot; please. Instead, click the SR link at top left to navigate back to the home page will will not leave an unnecessary feedback without a product review... then once your package arrives, click on &quot;orders&quot; and at that point you can enter a product review and leave your feedback. <br /><br />2) It would be very helpful if everyone mentioned which product they received from the vendor in the feedback they leave, and make sure this review is detailed enough regarding the quality that a fellow buyer could make a reasonable decision of whether or not to buy... your review may be the only one another buyer will be able to see for a given product<br /><br />3) Please be aware that you are able to update your feedback if you are not satisfied for some reason or if you did leave &quot;finalized early.&quot; Just go to your acct page, then click on &quot;view feedback&quot; and you may edit each one from there. This may be especially important if someone begins to scam unexpectedly.<br /><br />4) Update: If you are comfortable leaving the general date (month or date range maybe?) your order was received this would help make sure the feedbacks are recent and pertinent as some others mentioned. <br /><br />I believe this will make buying easier for all the buyer on the Road. We can also help to fight all the scammers and protect each other to the best of our ability. Please let me know if anyone else has any other suggestions. or just feel free to rant about how much you also hate the new system. Thank you<br /><br />Stay safe. Love you all :) <br />- miRNA<br /><br />Edit: added number 4 as recommended

				I don&#039;t know if this would be too risky, but leaving an approximate date of the transaction would be helpful too since we now can&#039;t see the age of feedback and thus we only know the historical quality of the vendor and don&#039;t know the instantaneous quality

				I&#039;ve been mentioning what product I received and putting&nbsp; time stamp on it (just the day format of review ex. 3/11)..<br /><br /><br />We need to keep this thread bumped so more people know to do this.. The feedback system is fucking USELESS now... by simply mentioning in detail WHAT we ordered, and putting a time-stamp on the review on ALL future reviews, we can at least help circumvent this shitty new update and help protect buyers from scammers who will use this change to their advantage.<br /><br />I REALLY wish they would just switch it back until a better resolution is figured out with the community&#039;s input. But until then, everyone please do this!

				Or maybe we can go back to having a useful feedback system. Amazon wouldn&#039;t do this nobody would use Amazon then lol listing just random feedback from whenever and they all say &#039;finalizing early for trusted seller 5/5&#039;

				My fellow buyers, our long battle of bitching has been heard, and our captain has responded! The feedback has been reverted back to a more helpful display thankfully. DPR is requesting your suggestions in the &quot;small changes&quot; thread regarding new potential feedback methods. <br /><br />Also, even though the feedback is now more clear, I still think it would be beneficial to remember the two suggestions about finalizing early and updating feedback, now the second no longer really applies though I dont think... thankfully :)

				Great post microRNA. You get Karma from me!<br /><br />Being able to view feedback in its totality in conjunction with information found on the forums are for me the most useful tools in choosing a vendor.&nbsp; Like it has been said, without that feedback our knowledge is limited and the potential for scamming increased.<br /><br />I&#039;m slightly dissociated right now but this is very encouraging stuff.
