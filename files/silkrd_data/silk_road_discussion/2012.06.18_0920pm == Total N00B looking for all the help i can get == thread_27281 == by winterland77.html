				You need to use a calculator a bit, if you buy a ten strip LSD blotters for 14 bitcoins and the price of bitcoins is of 6 $ this cost you 84$ for a price of 8,4$ per blotter. This is easy to calculate&nbsp; ;)

Sometimes it is rolled into the price. <br />Sometimes it is added during checkout, depends on vendor.
