				Now I&#039;m not stupid and I made it perfectly clear (in a polite manner might i add) that i am not willing to make a payment outside the escrow system. My main concern is that this vendor is possibly asking others to do the same (i mean why would he only ask me?) and not only that but isn&#039;t it against the rules for a vendor to do this?<br /><br />I don&#039;t really want to get the vendor in to any trouble as he may be genuine but my instincts tell me this is probably not the case. Should I report the vendor/name and shame? <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the best course of action is.<br /><br />Peace

				press the report vendor button and let SR staff handle the situation. If he is asking you, he is probably asking others. SR is a business, and they get no commission on bank transfers, not to mention you have no escrow protection with a bank transfer.

				The first thing i thought was that it is possibly LE...the only thing is... its a very well known vendor :-\&nbsp; It could be possible that his account has been hijacked by LE but the messages he sent did sound like the vendor as i have spoken to him in the past. I will leave it to the SR staff to deal with the report, its the right thing to do i think. I will send Scout a PM though. Peace.

				OK so Scout has replied to my PM and said it might be a good idea to name the vendor in order to make sure that people are aware and can avoid a similar situation. The vendor goes by the name of &quot;No Sticks No Seeds&quot;. <br /><br />This is how it went:<br /><br />I PM&#039;d the vendor asking if he could get a particular strain of weed...<br /><br />He replied saying yes he could and asked me how much i was after...<br /><br />I told him anything between an 8th and an oz (what ever he could get)...<br /><br />He then asked if i was willing to pay via bank transfer so the price would be cheaper...<br /><br />...now he was very quick to respond to my messages until i replied saying that would not be willing to pay outside of escrow and I asked him if he should even be asking my to do that...<br /><br />... he has not responded since...<br /><br />i did also noticed in his feedback that someone gave him a 1/5 for asking to pay the same way.

				with all of the bad reports of No Sticks No Seeds- why anybody still bothers to order from or talk to him is fucking stupid in itself<br /><br />but anyways, good on you for publicly naming the vendor. i would go as far to make the title of the thread- &quot;No Sticks No Seeds Asking for Bank Transfer for purchase&quot;<br /><br />fuck him, that is obviously not &quot;allowed&quot; here, but until a mod told you otherwise, you were covering for him. shady shit vendors like that need to be publicly known so nobody gets ripped or WORSE.<br /><br />just something to think about.

				This guy is a fucking idiot. Cop or not, stay far away from him/her. First, SR commission is cheap. You can actually pass it to your customers(kinda fucked up, but business is business-I say split the cost). Second, you&#039;re identified through bank deposits and near 100% of the time the customer or vendor doesn&#039;t have a shill bank account with a false name. If they did then they sure as hell wouldn&#039;t have trouble exchanging bitcoins for money!<br /><br />I know this is repetitive, redundant, preaching to the choir, but this shit is SERIOUS!!! We are talking about our freedom! It doesn&#039;t matter if you get caught with a gram of weed of an ounce of cocaine because it is all felonious. This is not a joke. Every transaction that involves drugs on this website can land you in serious FEDERAL trouble! To have this vendor disregard the rules in such a manner is such an idiotic thing to do that I can only shake my head.<br /><br />SilkRoad has a pretty damn good system going on. DPR has really put a lot of thought into establishing a safe system for people to buy drugs responsibly and with confidence. This guy has bypassed all of that and most likely will compromise any customers. Even if this guy completes a transaction with a member on SR and isn&#039;t a cop can get caught later down the road and that bank account stands a pretty good chance of being reviewed and then guess who gets noticed?<br /><br />People, I repeat, this is a serious game here. You can go to jail. You could piss your family, friends or coworkers off and ruin friendships because your extracurricular activities may not be viewed in a friendly manner as yourself. This should be considered especially if you&#039;re living under the roof of someone&#039;s house that doesn&#039;t like drugs! Kids need to refrain from buying until they have study enough threads about properly completing a transaction. A few hours of reading on this forum can determine if you can successfully utilize Silk Road or not. <br /><br />And anybody thinking about becoming a VENDOR, FUCKING STUDY UP ON YOUR FUTURE JOB AND ALL OF IT&#039;S RESPONSIBILITIES!!!! This job/hobby/career/fundraiser is NOT easy. To a certain degree it can be after you have done it for a some time. Each person is different and time can vary for a person and knowledge of the trade. This site is revolutionary and a first of it&#039;s kind with great features that have kept the doors open for this long so, thinking that you can just grab some drugs and sell them and have everything work out as the guy hustling on the corner is ignorant! A superior site calls for superior vendors! I know I sure as hell learned some of these things the hard way and I study the seller&#039;s/buyer&#039;s guide here and I&#039;m STILL learning things! This trade is constantly evolving so, staying on your toes and gaining knowledge whenever you can will ensure that you have a fighting chance compared to the person that fucks off with security.<br /><br /><br /><br />Take care,<br />SJ

				NO, what he was trying to do was bypass the protection systems that are in place here and take money away from the team that runs this site. He can do all the bank transfers he wants when he builds his own site and has customers flocking to it by the ones. SR has invested a lot of time, energy, and money to build this site, so if people want to use the, they will follow the sites rules. To further the point, and I&#039;m not calling him LE, there is no feedback lest for a bank transfer order, so he could scam again and again and again and never loose a single feedback point. And the forum is so active any more, and reports of scamming are easily pushed pages back if the discussion isn&#039;t kept going. <br /><br />So you are wrong phoboss, just wrong.

And then if one person gets compromised the entire SR community is? People, don&#039;t listen to this. <br /><br />I&#039;ll give you that the probability of&nbsp; NSNS is low, but that doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t need to worry about the fact he has banking information w/ names. Well, the fact that you did a bank transfer on SR in the first place should have concerned you or set some alarms off before you did it, but some of y&#039;all didn&#039;t do it. That is careless!<br /><br />Threads like this should be stickied alongside the buyer&#039;s guide(link to a database with these threads) and PM&#039;d to new members when they join. We can also have a sticky thread with that exact buyer&#039;s guide PM-w/ the database at the top each sub-forum here.<br /><br />Please SR, don&#039;t transfer money from your bank to someone else&#039;s. If you&#039;re that content to throw away your money use Greendot or Western Union. Those at least let you retain anonymity. Just use Silk Road&#039;s escrow service and you&#039;ll be ok.

				Doesn&#039;t matter whether it&#039;s true, false, pulled out of his rear end after having a large cup of tea this morning... <br /><br />The simple fact of the matter is that the very IDEA of asking for personal (bank) details, or giving them, or paying that way, is wrong. <br /><br />On this site, you&#039;re mostly buying illegal materials. If people are happy to do that by waving a huge white flag, saying &quot;it&#039;s me, it&#039;s me&quot;, then fair enough. But as far as I and many other people on this site are concerned, masking our identity is very important. That&#039;s why my name isn&#039;t actually bill... This is a made up username. <br /><br />The whole world SHOULD be told of any scenarios whereby a vendor is acting outside of the rules. Why should the public be told? Because whilst SR are making their investigations (prior to announcing anything), new buyers could be placing orders thinking it&#039;s acceptable to pay via Bank Transfer, when the escrow system works for most people, the BTC system works for all people, and how anonymity and privacy of personal data is key.

				But that paper trail only matters if he is busted first. LE doesn&#039;t have the time to investigate every bank transfer to find ones that are fishy. it is an additional charge in these cases, not the way people are caught. You mention TFM. You might want to read more about that. Their bust was due to using hushmail for unencrypted business talk. the hushmail cooperation led them to the financial investigation that led to more charges. We shouldn&#039;t even be having the discussion about this side of the issue because it is not relevant to Silk Road. The dodging of escrow is the only part of it that is relevant. There is also no way for them to correlate a bank transfer with an SR purchase, but guess what could be correlated to a&nbsp; degree...Bitcoin transactions. There is still a disconnect though when buying your coins correctly. He could be asking customers to pay with good vibes only which are not traceable at all, but to use SR for the transaction, SR gets their tribute...end of story. That is what he did wrong, and to my mind, that is all he did wrong. Outside of SR, I have done bank transfers for product, and guess what, I&#039;m gonna do them again. The bank transfer might add risk, but so does picking up your mail when it has drugs in it. What I will not do is meet a vendor on Silk Roads servers, talk to them over Silk Roads messaging system, put bitcoins in the wallet provided be SR, and bypass the purchasing system that allows the site to operate.

His selection and prices were superb - problem is he sounded like a complete psychopath in his profile. Several weeks later he posted one of his customers addresses on his profile.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Cheers for the recommendation mate i will take a look. i guess its my own fault to a certain point as i didn&#039;t really look much over the forums and just went in head first if i had looked i would have seen people having some issues with the guy. It was my 1st buy off SR but i am not going let it paint a picture of the site for me i just will just try with a different vender next time and hopefully this time i will get what i order. <br /><br />Shame as i was really looking forward to trying some nice weed. There are only so many dealers around my area an its rare that one of them gets a really nice bit of smoke in so would have been nice to try some proper kush. I have messaged him about it saying how shit it was and i just got gibberish back off him. Calling me brother and saying we a family and telling me that he is always ready telling me hopefully we can sort this out. Whats to sort out he sent me the stuff its not like anyone else sent me it, refund would be nice but very doubtful.... <br /><br /><br />

				@Zdet98<br />Nothing you can do really, just knock it on the head for next time. I&#039;m in the same boat as you pretty much - not many pickings where I am either. Been around for a while here buying it, you do learn a few things along the way, and would def. recommend this to someone relatively fresh-faced:<br /><br />1. following your gut instinct every time<br />2. find a good vendor and stick to them instead of saving £2/£3/g here and there<br />3. Choose a vendor that only sells weed - just a personal thing, no offense to other merchants. <br />4. Make sure they have decent spelling too..I&#039;m not exactly a grammar nazi but I&#039;m not the one being trusted with someones address! <br />5. PGP goes without saying<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Following on from my last post i have spoke to Mr.No seeds again, he messaged me saying talk to me in a few days as i am having sr issues and we can try sort something out, i replied informing him i was not interested in doing any more business with him an was not did not want to have any more contact with him.<br />His reply was pretty much along the lines of you buy cheep stuff dont expect the best. I accept that may be true but I payed the price he ask for, for a product i wanted to buy. If he set name to &quot;Cheep and cheerful weed&quot; i would have found something else to buy and would have happily payed the extra bit-coins for it so he can try and make it seem like its my own fault all he wants but he sold me the shit weed, he said he sent a sample but that was the same as the weed he sold me.<br /><br />Dont deal with this guy if he gets back on SR he is a selective scammer an shouldn&#039;t be given the privilege to sell on SR
