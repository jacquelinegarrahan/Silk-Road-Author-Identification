				Hey guys,<br /><br />I wanted to ask any and all of you if anyone is having problems with &quot;categories&quot; not showing or popping up. I&#039;ve actually had this problem for quite some time now but thought it may be related to all of the issues that have gone on recently. The only option I am left with is doing a search which as many of you know, isn&#039;t really the way to look around. Am I missing something or is this something that is &quot;normal&quot; now days?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any and all feedback mi amigos and amigas! Really appreciate all of your help and can&#039;t thank so many of you for always being there to help a fellow roadster get down the road in proper working order ;)<br /><br />Love &amp; Peace!

				Hmmm, well I don&#039;t know what&#039;s been my issue then but it happened to work all of a sudden last night for me! :) WOOT! So maybe you sent me some good luck vibes! If so, THANK YOU! haha&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone else run into any problems like this? Oh and one other thing I have issues with and that is when wanting to only search &quot;domestically&quot;, it gives me NO results, just an odd format all together where results should be. Hmm....<br /><br />If anyone thinks this post should be moved to a more appropriate area ie: tech support/advice, etc&nbsp; please let me know or mods, help a roadie out! :)<br /><br />Thanks guys!!

				All categories, or just some categories?<br /><br />If you live in an obscure country and have &quot;domestic only&quot; ticked (to show only vendors in your country), categories without any domestic vendors won&#039;t show up.

				Hmm no doesn&#039;t seem that way, I wish it was something that simple lol. I&#039;m just doing the norm, logging right in and that&#039;s it. It was where after logging in the cat&#039;s were just absent. Completely missing. So who knows. I&#039;ll let you guys know if it ever changes cause I&#039;m curious if it has or does happen to anyone else ever. I had absolutely no problems for nearly a year now, it wasn&#039;t until recently, I&#039;d say within the past 3 or so months now. But categories are back up and good to go for me! So that&#039;s the good news! <br /><br />The only issue I seem to be having is when I want to do a specific search on a product and then click to &quot;sort by&quot; and check the domestic only box. After doing so, its just blank. No results and I am most definitely NOT in a small country lol&nbsp; one of the ones that makes the road what it is ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />How about when any of you do just a search in the search bar for let&#039;s say, a specific product name. When you do that search, it doesn&#039;t give just that product. It is all type of different products and not just what you were searching for to begin with. Anyone know what I mean?<br /><br />Thanks for the replies guys! I appreciate it! :)<br />
