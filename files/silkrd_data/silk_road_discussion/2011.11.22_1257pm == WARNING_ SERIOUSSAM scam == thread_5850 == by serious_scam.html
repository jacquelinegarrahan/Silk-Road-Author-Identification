				IF people come to me with a problem, I will do my best to fix it, including reshipping xpresspost at my expense!&nbsp; &nbsp;You come here saying I scammed you WITHOUT you even sending me a PM about a missing pack.&nbsp; serious_scam, you create this account and then you start spamming that I have not come through with packages.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not even know you, and I certainly have not shipped any packages to someone called serious_scam.&nbsp; I think you are probably just a rival vendor who is pissed that someone with better product comes along to steal your business.<br /><br />You also claim that many customers are being scammed, which they are not.&nbsp; A few have not received orders yet which I am working with them to resolve on a one on one basis.&nbsp; I think it is fair that buyers openly voice that an order is taking longer than<br />expected, which many have done.&nbsp; There are many reasons why someone may have not received a pack, misaddressed, stolen, lost, seized, and this is just one of the issues there is when you move more product, there is simply more room for error and more chance that a package may not make it.&nbsp; I am taking responsibility for non received packages and doing my best to fix those who have not received their items in reasonable time.

				Hmmm..Interesting situation that I think can be resolved. SERIOUS x should consider 2mgs of Xanax or 5mgs Klonopin, every 4-6 hours as needed for the next 7 days. SERIOUS y should begin taking either mid dose Seroquel or Abilify daily for next 7 days, if it makes a difference, continue on indefinatley. <br />

				As mods, we can&#039;t delete accounts nor can we do anything on the market. the only thing that we can do is edit and remove posts. I suggest that you contact Sr on the market, click the contact us button on the bottom. thats all i could do..
