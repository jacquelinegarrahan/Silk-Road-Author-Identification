				Iove mdma. Especially the euphoric rush you get when coming up. <br /><br />A sort of squirmy, warm, loved-up, eyeball-rolling, fuck this is gooood type feeling. <br /><br />However, I wanna try other things, and I&#039;m wondering which drug(s) give good, strong come-up euphoric rushes?<br /><br />Euphoria. Rush. &lt;--- this is what I want. In abundance.<br /><br />I wanna be SO mashed, that I just spend hours on my sofa enjoying a kiss from God.<br /><br /><br />Now, I&#039;m a try anything onve type of guy, twice if I like it, lol.<br />BUT, I don&#039;t wanna inject anything.<br /><br />What can the kind fellows here at SR suggest?&nbsp; <br /><br />drug history: <br />Weed. (plenty of, lol) <br />MDMA crystal. (high tollerance) <br />xtc pills. (probably hundreds in my time) <br />LSD.&nbsp; (minimal experience so far, x3 tabs)<br /><br /><br />So what donyou guys think?<br />I don&#039;t just wanna pick stuff at random, so I&#039;d like some feedback from people who have actually taken stuff that gives the effects I desire.<br />Oh, and combo suggestions also welcome.<br /><br />Someone did suggest meth, so that&#039;s kinda on my list... so anything else that&#039;ll make me rush my tits off and give awesome euphoria?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />(PS, posting in forums while I&#039;m high,&nbsp; makes me babble. Soz. lol)&nbsp; :P

				i met a guy in rehab who used to shoot crack and he said it was the best rush god ever made. you heard me right, SHOOT. CRACK.<br /><br />the key, he told me, is you gotta use lime juice. lime juice will make the crack soluble in water.<br /><br />myself i prefer my lime juice in a vodka gimlet. or mixed with a shot of southern comfort if i&#039;m in that sort of mood.<br /><br />YMMV.

				One thing to try would be vaporizing a nice THC rich sativa bud so you get really high before you drop a roll or some MDMA. I have tried this a few times before dropping some strong dutch rolls (a whole speaker and a whole defqon another time) and it literally put me on my ass for almost two hours just basking in the glory of MDMA and the weed I had just vaped. Honestly, it felt like someone had strapped a rocket to me. I took off and wouldn&#039;t stop yet hadn&#039;t moved from my location. Also, 5-MeO-DIPT (foxy) has some crazy euphoria at a higher dose if you can combat the body load. Really pure coke is pretty euphoric and high doses of mephedrone can also be quite awakening and energizing.

				Obtain 50-75mg of Ice Shard Methamphetamine.<br />Obtain 20-30mg of Oxycodone (either as Percocet which contains tylenol, or pure like a Roxi) - use only 1/2 to 1/3 if you have a low tolerance to oxycodone.<br /><br />Crush all items into a fine powder. Add mixed powder into a shot glass and add orange juice or Gatorade to mask the taste and to dissolve the power. I would recommend stirring with a glass stirring rod or a toothpick.. You want to dissolve as much of the powder into the liquid as possible.<br /><br />Drink but hold the drink in your mouth. Do not swallow yet. After about a minute, you can swallow. You might want to chase it down with some other flavorful beverage (preferably non-alcoholic). Eat some chocolate also. <br /><br />Enjoy the sweet result. But know your limits. Don&#039;t re-dose until after 8 hours has past. If it wasn&#039;t as strong as you hoped, then next time up your quantities by 25%. The recommended span of time for re-dosing is for your protection. The goal was to enjoy yourself, not harm yourself.

				Combine around 60-70mg of MDA with 100-120mg of MDMA.<br />You will roll for hours and gives you more rush, etc.<br /><br />If you want strong body load, i&#039;d throw in around 10mg of 5-meo-mipt with just the mdma.

				I have mentioned this many times in may different topics: <br /><br />2cb + weed + nitrous is the most intense euphoria rush (tears of joy) I&#039;ve ever experienced. Give it a try..

				Maybe you should lay off drugs for a while, so your tolerances arent as high..<br /><br />or before you know it, you&#039;ll be on the H train looking for the next better high

				Be careful, the abuse of euphoria or rush drugs will leave you unable to feel even little of that when you are sober, and wanting more and more doses of the drug.

				and make sure you are not on anti-depresants. pretty much the &#039;euphoric&#039; part of drugs dont work at all once you been on them even once. your brain chems become all stable. less ups. less downs.<br /><br />for me this has been a good thing. i no longer crave that euphoria as its just a memory. but i still enjoy partying/socialising all night and having endless energy. socialising + energy + sharing +ve feelings is what makes drugs really good for mankind. &#039;rush&#039; &#039;high&#039; etc. is what leads to abuse and only ends badly I&#039;m afraiiiiiid :-(

				I think it&#039;s been said already here but Mephedrone gives a euphoria that is more like excitement than bliss, although you can get that too easily, very rushy, you may roll around on the sofa blissfully but then get very distracted by everything around you and want to do it all (and usually fuck it all too!).

				Maybe not the rush your looking for but based partly on the fact I wouldnt recommend anything dangerous and I feel you need steering away from some pretty addictive substances id say magic mushrooms, only one stain iv tried has ever cut the mustard (although im no pro) and that was mexican. Total and utter happiness and bliss. Life makes so much sense and the energy! We had them inside dark chocolate bars in Amsterdam. Eat 2-3 of them and you will be in the presence of god
