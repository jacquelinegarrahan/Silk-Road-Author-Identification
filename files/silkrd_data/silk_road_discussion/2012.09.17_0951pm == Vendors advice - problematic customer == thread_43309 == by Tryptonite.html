				I am a vendor here on the road. These are my stats - ranked in the top 23% of sellers with 98.5% positive feedback from 195 transactions. I have been actually vending on here for 5 months, though the account is 8 months old. I have not had ONE person complain about the quality of my product until just recently. This person is saying that my MDMA was no good &amp; did nothing for them. Everyone else seems to love my products &amp; even return for more. I told the one complaining that I have never had an issue about quality from anyone else &amp; feel that there is nothing to resolve. This is the first time I&#039;ve had this problem out of all my transactions so far. How do other vendors&nbsp; handle this issue? Thanks in advance for any input or advice.

				To be honest, I have had 6 out of 112 sales total. They were all mushroom related.<br /><br />I personally think that some try it to get free product.<br /><br />You have two choices, <br /><br />A) Ship them a replacement product and hope they leave a decent rating.<br />B) Tell them to fuck off and take the hit to your score.<br /><br />Ok, enough of the hardline stuff&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />To me a lot of it has to do with the customers attitude and how they approach you. <br /><br />From the message do you feel that he is just trying to get free product? <br />Did you point out that you have sold lots of the product and it is highly rated? <br />Have you tried the product yourself and if so have you let him or her know that it is tested by you?<br /><br />Have you had them explain how they took the product and was there an issue with the method they used?<br />The above applies to mushrooms from my point of view. Several of my ratings were from people who took 1g or less and did not trip hard so they felt that it was no good. One even admitted to eating a full meal before taking 2g and &quot;did not feel much of anything&quot; I don&#039;t know if MDMA is as touchy as eating mushrooms or if the dosage could be in question but if it is I would ask.<br /><br />Once you have gotten a feel for the person and the issue I would simply ask them what they would expect you to do to rectify the situation. Sometimes it is simple, sometimes they demand something that is unreasonable. At this point it is a negotiation you simply need to find out if s/he is being honest and how you can make it better. Remember there are a lot of things you can offer including discounts on there next purchase or even free shipping. Heck you can even give them a % refund with a coupon code that they can only spend with you or even give them a coupon code that is good for the cost of shipping when offering them free shipping on there next purchase.<br /><br />You will note that I only stated two choices and nether was a refund of their bitcoin. If they are demanding their money back and will accept nothing less, they are a scammer in my book. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks, I have tried discussing the issue with him &amp; his messages don&#039;t make much sense. I pretty sure he is just trying to scam me. I think I am just going to take the hit on my feedback. Everyone else that has tried my product knows the true quality of it &amp; I do have many repeat customers. Its just a shame that even vendors have to worry about being scammed.

				it sucks hearing this sort of stuff from vendors. sometimes buyers are just ignorant and improperly use the product, but i figure almost all is just scammers trying to get free product<br /><br />i guess id expect it for people buying coke or heroin, but shrooms and x? thats sad

				Beren102, we get all kinds here on SR. Some are trying for the first time and some are experienced at what they are doing.<br /><br />I think some try to scam because they think we will give in to keep the good rating, some may just be doing it to score some free drugs. Some may be of the mind set that we are rolling in the money and wont miss a little so it is really no big deal. Sometimes there really is an issue and as a vendor we have to acknowledged that and work through it to keep customers happy.<br /><br />All and all, as a vendor we do what we can to help our customers and provide them with a great product. <br /><br />As the old quote goes, &quot;You can please all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot please all the people all the time.&quot;

				Trypt,<br /><br />I know you didn&#039;t ask for a buyers perspective, but I wanted to throw my two cents in.&nbsp; One of my favorite vendors on the road has overwhelmingly great reviews however there was one person that just went after him/her with a major hard on.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking gave a 1/5 review, hit the boards posting how bad the vendors product was and even started a thread in a way that sounded like it was a legit analysis of the general product but was actually a cover to just trash this vendor.&nbsp; The thing was the customer with a beef didn&#039;t come across as crazy, but wrote well and had some strong reasoning to their argument.<br /><br />And you know what?&nbsp; I don&#039;t give a shit.&nbsp; That particular vendor has top notch speed, responsiveness, customer service and good packaging.&nbsp; By far the vendors product is really great.&nbsp; Some of their product I tried and wasn&#039;t what I was hoping it would be but most (and I mean most) of the other product blew me away.&nbsp; &nbsp;I still use the vendor and highly recommend them.<br /><br />Don&#039;t think that customers will be swayed by a bad review.&nbsp; Granted, some might but I&#039;d venture a guess those are high maintenance customers anyway, and probably customers you don&#039;t want in the long run.&nbsp; &nbsp;Give most buyers credit, we know there are assholes out there and every vendor is going to have to deal with them sometime.&nbsp; In fact, the vendors that have absolutely perfect ratings have probably had to buy off a piss ant a time or two and that ends up costing me more money because that vendor has to raise their prices to cover it.<br /><br />One of the things that made me very loyal to this vendor was that, when I was a stone cold newbie, they sold me a small amount of product (certainly not weight) without requiring me to FE and then treated me well through the process and as I came back for more.<br /><br />If it&#039;s just an occasional asshole I&#039;d say be way cool in trying to fix it, customer service goes a long way, but there comes a point you just tell &#039;em to fuck off.

				It&#039;s cool to get a buyers perspective on this too &amp; thanks. I have had a couple of issues with other people involving shipping, and after sending a few PM&#039;s back and&nbsp; forth, I got the feeling that they were acting mature &amp; honest. I had no problem resolving those issues. This one just doesn&#039;t but off that vibe at all.

				A potency complaint is hard to deal with. I had this problem. My product was giving me a nice effect but sometimes people expect more or they&#039;re really after a freebie or their body chemistry is different. It&#039;s hard to know what&#039;s really going on. I tried to be as nice as I could about it and I ended up taking a hit to my feedback.<br /><br />Imagine if people went to the pharmacy, took the pills, came back to the store the next day and said they didn&#039;t like the effect. Or if they went to the doctor, didn&#039;t feel better and wanted their money back the following week.<br /><br />On SR, people expect what they wouldn&#039;t in real life which is kind of wild. After all this is illegal drugs and the customer satisfaction is expected to be beyond what you&#039;d get at rite aid.<br /><br />I sell sample sizes. If people like they can order more if they don&#039;t like they can move along. I try to provide potent product but there are variables I can&#039;t control-I don&#039;t know how it will impact the customer or what the customer expects. <br /><br />I even gave a full refund including shipping from a potency complaint and I still got a shitty feedback. So I&#039;m just trying to do my best and hope my feedback doesn&#039;t get too unattractive. I really don&#039;t see how you can get perfect feedback. Just have to move on anyway.
