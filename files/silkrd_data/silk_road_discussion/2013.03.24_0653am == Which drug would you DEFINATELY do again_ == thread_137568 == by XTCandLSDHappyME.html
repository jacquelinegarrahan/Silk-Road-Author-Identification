DMT is one for me.. too many questions that are waiting not to be answered lol!...maybe suppose crack (freebase) cocaine..not all its cracked up to be but very moreish..and probably loads more for me but lets hear your favourites :)

				Probably any of them.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say there&#039;s a drug I dislike besides Ketamine and dissociatives in general.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been doing much besides weed and the occasional MDMA for a couple months now though.

Anyways I&#039;m going to just postpone this for a later day when I&#039;ve mentally prepared to go into this by my self, but thank you, +1 for the positive vibes.

				Yeah i think you will find you probably wont need one, esp as you&#039;ve done shrooms before. As good as it is to be prepared no one really needs a sitter once the&#039;re past the initial period leading upto dropping + 1 hour for it to kick in. You&#039;ll soon realise its more managable then you thought. Saying that though dropping cid when you dont want to isnt the best idea. lets just say you&#039;ll do it when the times right&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Also to stay on topic. Earlier i posted id love to do some mxe again because its been to long, i&#039;ve just bought some.. yay for the road&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				Speedballs are the greatest rush in the world (IMO). I&#039;d love to do them again, but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;d get a habit. Also probably kill myself if I got some good stuff. <br />Looking forward to quaaludes, gonna try some soon. The last time I did it I don&#039;t even remember what they felt like. Last ones I took were mandrax in Texas in 1980. Probably was drinking at the same time, which is something I won&#039;t do this&nbsp; time. <br />Of course I will do MDMA again. That doesn&#039;t go out of style.

				Mephedrone.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only done a gram which was provided to me as a free sample a couple months ago.<br /><br />By far one of the loveliest drugs I&#039;ve experienced. <br /><br />I enjoyed it far more than I ever have MDMA, bk-mdma... probably even more than amp/methamp which says alot.<br /><br />I wish US vendors carried it. It&#039;s kind of baffling why it hasn&#039;t caught on over here.<br /><br /><br />

				I guess I would say any of the dozen I&#039;ve tried, only excluding (heavy), alcohol,&nbsp; tobacco, and DXM from the list.&nbsp; (Sorry for basically answering the &quot;not do again&quot; question) Maybe DXM with a longer rest period, just not sure it was enjoyable to me.<br /><br />I&#039;ve spaced my use out and only tried things in good environments, and I generally feel that with this attitude and an eye on my mental health, I can navigate a number of novel experiences and revisit them with enough time to allow for recovery and tolerance mitigation.

				LSD, MDMA, shrooms, and mj probably top my list. Not to hi-jack, but I think it would be interesting to know what one drug, if it could only be one, they would do again. Which... is a tough question. Shrooms, I think.

				25i-NBOMe definitely! Especially a higher than normal dose. (1.2mg-2mg) I found my first and only trip on it to be pretty amazing compared to my two other trips on 25c-NBOMe. Granted, the 25c was a considerably lower dose (800ug)
