				It&#039;s sad , but I couldnt supress a laugh in the shop when i went on to read that hi mate, who had tripping with him, ran across the road naked and got hiy by a car lmao.<br />How much LSD would you need to OD, or maybe its a toxic batch, like they say. Its making a huge resurgence here, young guys are sick of paying 30-40 bux for an eccy(usually crap), whaen they can go tripping for twice, three times as long for 15-25 bux.

				Overdose on LSD would knock you out big time, possibly biggest, c&#039;est fini. Going full retard on LSD it&#039;s more than possible, especially with people not ready for it.

				If i told you the amount of lsd i have dropped at one time you would not belive me------no one does, except people that were there.<br /><br />I have seen people dose twice that amount-------you aint OD on LSD unless you a chemist and fuck up&nbsp; with some ergot alkaloids.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you did OD, I imagine death would be respiratory, but can we say grams!!!

				from what i&#039;ve heard, in order to actually overdose on LSD, you would need to take over 100,000uq at once. that being said, i don&#039;t think anyone has come close to that and actually died from a OD on LSD, but i could be wrong.&nbsp; i do personally know people who have taken aprox. 10,000uq before, and they are fine.
