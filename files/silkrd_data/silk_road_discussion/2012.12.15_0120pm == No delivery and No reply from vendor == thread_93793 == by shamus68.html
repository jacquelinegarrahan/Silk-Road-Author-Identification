				This happens everyday unfortunately... do not FE because there&#039;s nothing you can do. You can&#039;t get a refund.<br />If I were you I would search the forum for the vendor to see if there are reports for him being a scammer.<br />What&#039;s his stats? Transactions and % feedback?

				Sorry to tell you man but you dont FE, there are sooo many people that will not make you FE even if you are new remember that next time and just look else where..NEVER FE unless its for subsandaddy..lol.. But never do bro unless you have built a long time relationship and i still would not suggest it cause many up and turn from great vendors to scams overnight..But what u can do is giving him a 1/5 feeedback and where u can write about it say what happen, and warn ppl. tell him u will change your feedback if he sends your drugs, cause u giving him 1/5 and talking shit bout what he did will rflect his stats...thats only thing u cn do and continue to msg him

YOU NEVER FE.<br /><br />The problem with that is it is all wrong. There are many legit vendors that have buyers FE. <br /><br />Could you please tell us what country you are in and what country the vendor is in? How many days has it been since your order has been marked in transit? You say that you messaged the vendor 2 times and they are still unread..is his vendor page showing that he has in fact logged on?<br /><br />When you answer these things we can be a lot better help to you. In fact with out this information, no one on here can tell you anything good or bad. I can see this is your second order. From him or just in general? <br /><br />Just because you FE in no way means you are not going to get your package.<br /><br />

If you didnt know the answer to this question before ordering then you rushed. To try to help now would require more information.<br /><br />How long have you been waiting , domestic or INT. If you feel that the time frame is well for than what you would expect them naming said vendor would also help. only do this if you&nbsp; are 95% certain that the package is lost.&nbsp; Were u scammed is another question but that would go on vendor reputation.

				I&#039;m really starting to get tired of reading these threads. I really don&#039;t mean to be rude but if you FE then you get what you deserve.&nbsp; NOBODY can make you FE. Noobs need to stop buying into this shit that they need need to FE. Bullshit! You do need to start small to build trust, but FE is something I would not even think about it unless they are in the top 1% of vendors. <br />These forums and the information within are here for a reason.&nbsp; If you just come here and order without properly researching everything, I mean PGP, site etiquette, vendors, delivery, and more, then you are bound to have bad experiences. This isn&#039;t fucking amazon.com. This is still a drug deal, it&#039;s the future of drug deals IMHO, but it&#039;s still a risk!<br />Please, please, please take time to educate yourself and minimize that risk before you act and you will find SR to be a beautiful thing.
