				Hi , iam new here since 2 weeks + . I have a order in past but nothing does happen . So i waited for 5 Days but no reaction from Seller so i chancel order on day 5 ( ok my order was a few days before Christmas) After them i wrote to 2 Sellers (domestic also) but i doesnt become a Answer . Byuing drugs on SR is really not easy becouse you get no Answers or Reactions from Seller . I´ve´read the ByersGuide and all&nbsp; importend Documents to go the right way but it doesnt work ! <br />Shame about it I thought it would be easy to buy here but what is it easier on the street 100x. &#039;m Just disappointed that the money that I have loaded onto SR is probably for nothing when I answered no seller.<br /><br />Good new Year ,<br />Morpheus303

				What are you trying to get man?&nbsp; Are you messaging them with encrypted messages or with regular english?&nbsp; If you are messaging them with regular english like how we are talking, they aren&#039;t going to respond to you because that&#039;s a security risk for them that isn&#039;t worth taking.&nbsp; I&#039;ve just joined SR as well and so far it has seemed like a great community, I&#039;d be glad to try and help you out.&nbsp;

Few vendors actually require and enforce PGP.<br /><br />Morpheus, don&#039;t let your bad experience with these vendors get to you. Silk Road is an awesome marketplace once you get around and figure things out. If a seller doesn&#039;t respond to you, send them another message. You can check your &quot;sent&quot; box, if your message title is bold it means they haven&#039;t even read it yet. So that might be it too.<br /><br />That usually doesn&#039;t happen with most vendors. Maybe the vendor required FEing and you didn&#039;t finalize? (just a tip now, never FE) Whatever the reason, it&#039;s pretty unprofessional for a vendor to do that. Take your money elsewhere on SR. There are a shit ton of awesome vendors who do what they can to satisfy their customers, you just gotta look.

				hey thx for your fast responding . <br /><br />No no i didnt FE becouse i read its mostly scam , i look for the best 3 Sellers with very good Reputation from Germany where i life , so the risk is lower than over EU or International orders . I don´t know if i can name the Sellers here from there i would buy , but i can say there are members here for a few months with good Reputation and all of them make escrow espacially for domestic so i think they are serious ! <br />At beginning i have a work in for the GPG now i know how i can decrypt/encrypt . <br /><br />First order was on 29.12.12 i place a order and wrote my address in the order but at this time not Crypted becouse i still working in GPG , 5 Days later nothing happens so i Chancel order in meantime i ask 2 more Sellers with very good reputation if they are @ start becouse last Order nothing happens . But get no answer . <br /><br />One of the Sellers i would order from is written in his Site he will be back in 2-3 days , the other is still every day online i send him encrypted PM but he gave no answers too me or any reaction . <br /><br />Since 3 Weeks i only try to buy some nice things and only have bad expierences here and that with 3 sellers that have very good Reputation one of them is working here (written in his Site) so i don´t know what i can do to make a good exp. here <br /><br />greetz , <br />Morpheus

				Go back to pre-school and learn patience. ALL of the vendors here have their own lives and doesn&#039;t really want to spend 15+ minutes telling you &quot;yes, I have this product and I will work with you&quot;. Just no, if they post their wares on SR, it&#039;s 99% likely that they&#039;re accepting your business. If you want your questions answered, ask them on the forums, it&#039;s so much easier than doing it on SR. It&#039;s very common to wait at least 5 days to see what&#039;s happening with your order on the orders page. the cancel button doesn&#039;t exist for 4 days for a very good reason. <br /><br />I understand that you&#039;re German and all but seriously, your English should be better. Use an online translator if you must.&nbsp;
