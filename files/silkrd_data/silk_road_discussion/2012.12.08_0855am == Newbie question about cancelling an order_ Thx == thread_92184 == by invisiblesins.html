				Hi, one of the newbie noobs to Sr --&gt; ♥ Love ♥ the site and I think I have found my paradise&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I have an order in Transit and looking forward to receiving it, today maybe&nbsp; :), and also an order pending.<br /><br />Now my question is; The order still pending was my original 1st contact, he/she said next day delivery if purchased before 3 (which I did) - that was Mon gone.<br />Trouble is, as I have been on these Meds for over 5 years, and have a major dependency, So silly me really needs them by Tue&#039;s and I get the feeling from his/her last PM that this just aint goner happen. I would not have made the order if I knew it would take time, Plus I am limited to the amount Btc&#039;s I have on account for now.<br />(I didn&#039;t FE. In fact reading between the lines the seller does not have the listed item in stock? Delivery is inside my country)<br /><br />I don&#039;t wish to be seen as pushy and I don&#039;t want any negatives towards my account, but I explained everything beforehand and needed em fast: so can I cancel this order and buy from my 2nd contact who as been absolutely superb and help me along some what?<br />many thanks for the replies <br />Sins

				What do you mean pending? Is it in transit or &quot;processing&quot;?<br />If in transit I believe you can&#039;t do anything else than wait. I would suggest ordering some low quantity from someone else to be safe. If you don&#039;t get the package the resolution usually takes some time and you will probably run out if you want to wait for a refund.<br />You could ask the vendor to cancel only if the order&#039;s status is still &quot;processing&quot;.<br />Good luck.

				thanks for reply,<br /><br />Yup, sry my bad, wrong terminology as its still at &#039;processing&#039; stage in my Account.<br />When I contacted Vendor they replied with a sort of I&#039;ll contact &#039;them&#039; and see whats happening? like a 3rd party peeps is involved (so its deff not in transit), Understandable as we all have to source the gear from somewhere, so I don&#039;t mind that, but withdraws will be upon me come Tues, silly me as I promised I&#039;d never go there again ::)<br /><br />Vendor did state, and I have it still in messages, that if ordered that day b4 3pm it would be shipped for next day domestic, so I was sorta presuming that Sellers had stock on them or close to their disposals.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ve decided just to leave it for now, don&#039;t want 2b pushy as I know things can take time.<br /><br />I&#039;m goner go fish for more Btc&#039;s and get into account latest by Sun and try with another vendor; as I have sourced a couple more or even go for more off 2nd seller I&#039;ve an order in transit with,<br />thanks again tho - I just love the Road ahead :-)<br />Sins

				Most vendors are professional and would accept to cancel the order if you explain the situation. But if you can get some coins, yes just give him time and order from someone else to be sure.

				This is a bump and hijack so sorry ::)<br /><br />I cant remember for sure but i thought i read somewhere that there is a fee for cancelling orders. Is that right?<br /><br />Iv had an order at the processing stage since the 12th Dec. Didn&#039;t really want to cancel but could be doing with the coin. Especially if I&#039;m going to be charged!!<br /><br />Any info?

				Most sellers are incredibly reasonable, for the nature of this business the customer service is amazing.&nbsp; Explain you situation as simply as you can and most the time it won&#039;t be a problem.&nbsp; However, sometimes its already out in the process and in that case you have to live with it.&nbsp; Looking for quick deadlines is tough on here, cause you never know how busy the seller is beforehand.&nbsp; If you have a deadline always message ahead of time to see what the sellers deal is.&nbsp; Also I&#039;ve gotten packages from the same seller, one will arrive in a few days the other may take a few weeks.&nbsp; Postal is very unpredictable.&nbsp; Rule of thumb always give yourself enough time.&nbsp; Hope it all works out for you

				Cheers, but what i mean is that the order is still at the processing stage, and that&#039;s over a week now. I have the option to cancel but can not remember if i read i would be charged for doing so. I don&#039;t want to be charged ;) Thats what im trying to find out. Sent a pm to vendor, no reply. So posted on their thread, so will see.<br /><br />Is there a fee for cancelling an order that has been left in the processing stage for over a week?<br /><br />That is my question ???

				This may not work for everyone because I do get dinged a small % fee for cancelling but it is worth it to me:<br /><br />If an order is still in processing after 4 business days &amp; there isn&#039;t any information listed on the vendor profile page or I have not been messaged as to why my order has not been mailed out yet then I message the vendor. If I don&#039;t hear back after another business day I cancel my order &amp; spend my btc with another vendor. There are some vendors will mark your order as &#039;in transit&#039; without actually sending it so you can&#039;t cancel your order:<br /><br />I had a vendor tell me on a Friday nite that my order had shipped usps priotity &amp; that I should be right quick about finalizing once it arrived. When the order didn&#039;t arrive on Wednesday I messaged the vendor. I was told that they could not fullfill my order &amp; I would be seeing a refund. I was just glad to get my btc back &amp; didn&#039;t bother to ask why they misled me that my product was shipped but also why it took 3 business days &amp; a msg to them to find this out ?&nbsp; This was a vendor with a 99 score &amp; lots of positive feedback with glowing reports on the forums.<br /><br />This was the first &amp; last experience with this vendor. I am a patient customer except when I am deceived &amp; manipulated for absolutely no reason. When I find a good vendor I stick with them till they stop listing products of interest.

				Yeah mate, I though there was a fee too. But dint seem to be.<br /><br />Rightly so imho, why should have to have their coin tied up if the vendor can&#039;t dispatch with no reason given?<br /><br />The vendor seems quite respcted to, so it was odd not to get replies from pm!<br /><br />fg
