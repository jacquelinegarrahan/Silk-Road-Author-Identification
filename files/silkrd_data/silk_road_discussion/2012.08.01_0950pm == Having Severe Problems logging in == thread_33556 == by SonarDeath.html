				Hi I am having severe problems logging in after the most recent SR upgrade. I am successful in logging in on only about 1 out of every six attempts. Please can you fix this? It&#039;s very frustrating.

				I noticed that SR was really slow these last few hours, and I also got logged out a lot of times while browsing the website.&nbsp; Is DPR doing something on the servers?
