				As a former LEO, I can say that the kind of scheme you&#039;re suggesting wouldn&#039;t net the kind of vendor that LE is looking for.<br /><br /><br />I just thought of a good way that LEO could catch a vendor.&nbsp; Almost shared it.&nbsp; Won&#039;t share it with anyone except scout, if he asks.&nbsp; LE listens to these forums.

And in point of fact, no way to prove that the person is a vendor, just highly suggests it that the person accepting cash could be a vendor.<br /><br />I would assume that any idea one of &quot;us&quot; has, one of &quot;them&quot; will either come up with soon, or has already had.

				There are much better ways for vendors to cash their bitcoins. For one thing, mailed cash through SR is not cost effective, the SR commission alone is bad. Combine that with shipping and the amount being charged by the person mailing the cash and you&#039;ve got people paying 30 bucks for a 20 dollar bill.

				There is allways a way to catch a vendor if you put enough resources into it. The game is to allways be harder to catch than the next guy. LE like anyone wants the most return on their investment, you have to be the least amount of return on their investment.

				You should always be careful about the information you reveal on these forums. I always change my stories slightly from the truth and mix up details on purpose so anyone looking through all my posts wouldn&#039;t be able to figure out who I am. I always try and imagine that one of my good friends in real life is reading what I write and I make sure they wouldn&#039;t be able to work out that it&#039;s me. I think that&#039;s a good way to screen the things I say here.<br /><br />I remember seeing a well known vendor post here about 2 different online shopping sites he was a frequent customer of, and he mentioned things about the sites that demonstrated he would have used his real details when purchasing. If LE cross-checked all the customers of both sites against the general geographical location of where his shipments were coming from I&#039;m sure they&#039;d be able to narrow who he could be done to a short list of people.<br /><br />You can never be too careful!

				While everyone should take utmost precaution on here, I think people give LEO too much credit. The vast majority of LEO&#039;s work on local crime...the ones that are on here actively looking for leads are going for BIG busts. Most of the stuff on here, like sell 1/4 ounces of weed won&#039;t turn their heads.&nbsp; Plus any vendor who has illegal listings and is giving out their real name and address for people to send money to is an idiot!
