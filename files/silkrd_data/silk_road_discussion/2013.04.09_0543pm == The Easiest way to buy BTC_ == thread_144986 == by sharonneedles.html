				go to virwox and you can use a card or paypal to transfer the money in.&nbsp; Then buy Linden Dollars (SLL) and once you&#039;ve got those you can buy bitcoins with it.&nbsp; a bit fiddly but quick

				no, I had an old sl account I used from back in the days when it was always in the news, bit like the way SR is now..&nbsp; newbies tumbling from the sky.<br /><br />The other thing I forgot to mention is that they hold the first transfer out for up to 48 hrs as they do it manually, so if you need to get the coins out in a hurry you&#039;ll be stuck but at least you&#039;ll have the coins.<br /><br />If they make you get a sl account then you need to get one and make sure you have a payment method on file (you can go into the account config and make sure that it can&#039;t be used to withdraw, only to bring in)&nbsp; then go to a virwox terminal and touch it, that will hook the account up to the virwox account. <br />

				If you&#039;re completely new to sl, this is what you do.. (the detail of some steps I&#039;ve omitted as they have changed since I last did it)<br /><br />Go to virwox and create your account<br />go to secondlife.com and create your account.&nbsp; <br />go back to virwox and put in your account name<br />download the sl viewer (there&#039;ll be a link on the sl account set up page) and once it&#039;s installed open it<br />put in your account name and password and click login<br />when you arrive, switch voice off (unless you like the sound of racist, pig ignorant knuckle draggers baying at you) and don&#039;t respond to anyone (scammers galore).&nbsp; If you fancy doing the newbie tutorial on how to do the basics, go ahead but if you don&#039;t..<br /><br />go back to virwox and go here https://www.virwox.com/terminals.php<br />pick any active link (no warning signs beside it) and right click &gt; copy link<br /><br />go back to the sl viewer and ctrl-h, you&#039;ll see a chat history window open that has all the drivel that those around you have been spewing in text<br />paste the copied link into the chat bar at the bottom of the page, check your chat history window and it should show the link then click on it.&nbsp; if it asks you are&nbsp; you sure you want to tp, say yes<br />when you arrive, you should be in front of the terminal (looks a bit like a silver pulpit and has the virwox logo on it), if you don&#039;t see it, you should see a red arrow on the screen which indicates you need to walk towards the arrow.&nbsp; use your keyboard arrow keys for the walking thing<br /><br />left click the machine and it should give you some options and it should say it&#039;s owned by euroSLEX Euler .&nbsp; Check the name before you do&nbsp; anything as scams do happen.<br /><br />it should give you an option to verify, so do that...&nbsp; <br /><br />then you&#039;re done (unless you need to transfer money that way).<br /><br />if you want to log out you can do so and make sure you restart the viewer and change the destination to last known (or something like that) that way you&#039;ll always log back in to that terminal if you have to.

				Thanks a million for the detailed and in depth instructions. I&#039;ve been using virwox for ukash for a while now so I&#039;ve been registered all along but I never noticed the debit card deposit. I don&#039;t have a sl account however so these instructions are a great help. Do you know what my deposit limit will become once I do this? It&#039;s at €100 now but for some reason it&#039;s really only €50. I hope it gets a lot higher.<br /><br />thanks a lot!

				I have no idea, I&#039;ve just added paypal inwards with mine and it only allows me 150usd per month..&nbsp; and a maximum of 65usd per day, I think.&nbsp; There&#039;s a web page somewhere on the site that tells you what the limits are, I think.&nbsp; You&#039;ll just need to go sniffing around the site until you find the page.&nbsp; You can try emailing them but they don&#039;t seem to respond to stuff that&#039;s not directly related to a transaction.&nbsp; Even when they do, it&#039;s usually hours before you&#039;ll get a response.
