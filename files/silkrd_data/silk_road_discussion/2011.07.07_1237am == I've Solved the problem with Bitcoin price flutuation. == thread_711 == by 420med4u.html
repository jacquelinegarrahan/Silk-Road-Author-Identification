				I am going to raise the price. For example, if I am selling something for 300 USD, I am going to jack the price up to 380 USD and will let my customer knows that I am actually selling the item for 300 USD firm! While the item is in transit and if the price drop to 340, then I will issue 40 bucks back to the buyer after he releases from escrow or if the price goes up to 420, then I will issue 120 to the buyer after he releases the bitcoin. This way the buyer and me wins! I get my cut and the buyers are happy! Sounds good to everyone?<br /><br />USD=BTC

				i like the idea. as long as you follow through with it (i&#039;m sure you will). he may even be able to implement this into the market as a feature. obviously, this would account to more transactions though. hope it works for you!

				I think this is a very good idea.&nbsp; How much over the purchase price would you expect the buyer to put up upfront?&nbsp; In your example of a $300 you said you were going to charge $380, which is just under ~27% surcharge.&nbsp; It should probably be more of a round number surcharge to make it easier for people to budget.&nbsp; I think its a great idea and I hope SR can write this feature into the code of site.&nbsp;

				as posted in another thread, heres my interpretation of the idea, if SR were to implement it:<br /><br />-the seller can be give the option to specify a &#039;target price&#039; when he puts an item up for sale.<br />-to account for fluctuation, SR will add a certain value onto the price, which probably will be calculated using 2 things:<br />a) the current price in bitcoins<br />b) the total for the item in question (bigger price, bigger adjustment)<br />-the buyer will buy using the full price as listed on SR<br />-escrow, when releasing the funds, will release the &#039;target price&#039; to seller, and &#039;(total listing price - target price)&#039; back to the buyer.<br /><br />heres an example. the seller has username &#039;Seller&#039; and the buyer has username &#039;Buyer&#039;. &#039;Item&#039; is whats being sold.<br /><br />-Seller- puts up -Item- for a -Target Price- of $300.<br />Using the current price in bitcoins and the -Target Price-, SR calculates it should put up -Item- for $380 -Listing Price-.<br />Item goes up for $380 -Listing Price-, and -Buyer- buys it from -Seller-.<br />-Buyer- sends $380 to escrow.<br />DUE TO FLUCTUATION, the total value of the -Listing Price- goes down to $365<br />When it comes time to release funds, ESCROW sends -Target Price- of $300 to -Seller-<br />Then, ESCROW subtracts -Target Price- $300 from -Listing Price- $365 to find the -Refund Price- $65<br />-Refund Price- $65 is given to -Buyer-<br />

				What happens when the exchange rate of USD/EUR to BTC fluxuates more than 20-30% below the total price paid in USD/EUR? Will you refund the buyers out of pocket?

				Also imho other sellers will take advantage of your method (eg. they&#039;ll sell without the surcharge) so you either have to vend unique or very high quality products to stay in competition.
