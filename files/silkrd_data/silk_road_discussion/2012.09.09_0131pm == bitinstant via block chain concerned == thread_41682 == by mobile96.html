				instead of calling it bit instant they should call it bit eventually.&nbsp; over 12 hours and nothing although I did get a reply back from them saying they would look into it.Thank you spacecae at least I feel a little more comfortable knowing I am not the only one&nbsp; who has had to wait. It still sucks just hope the vendor still has product by the time I get my coins.

Hope it gets to you a week from now. I&#039;ve use bitinstant for all of my BTC, and the longest I&#039;ve waited is like 30 minutes. Usually it&#039;s there by the time I even make it back home from Walmart!
