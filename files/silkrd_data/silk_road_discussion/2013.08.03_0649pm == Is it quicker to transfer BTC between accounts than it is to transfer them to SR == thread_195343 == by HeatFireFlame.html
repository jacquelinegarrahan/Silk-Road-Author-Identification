				My question is, We all know the time it can take to get BTC into your sr wallet can vary, I have been waiting for around 6 hours atm, It seems to go up and down (anyone know what its at roughly?)<br />But is it quicker when transferring money between sr accounts?

				I dont think it makes a difference where to or from you transfer,&nbsp; it is all dependant on the btc network.

				It is. That&#039;s because a true BTC transfer isn&#039;t needed, in the traditional sense. The SR system simply adjusts their internal ledger to move coins from one account to another, so it doesn&#039;t need to be submitted to the BTC network. Think of bitcoins within SR as internal credits rather than bitcoins. Bitcoins in, credits within, bitcoins out.
