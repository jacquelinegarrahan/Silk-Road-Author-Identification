				Seen alot of posts today for people with MoneyPaks to trade for BTC&nbsp; of course they want quick transactions......This had me thinking maybe I could make a profit.... I even spent 5 whole minutes researching before I realized that I could probably be scammed in more than 10 ways.... what are the most common ways to get scammed...It was either this thread or make one about planning ahead for future purchased as Christmas will make the shipping times even longer!

				It is simply amazing to me how easy it is for people to be separated from their money.&nbsp; I weep for humanity. There is a reason that the one constant across space and time - a funny saying about a fool and his money.&nbsp; No mater the time in history or culture...everyone has a saying.<br /><br />There is a sucker born every minute<br />Caveat Emptor<br />A fool and his money will not long be together<br />It&#039;s morally wrong to allow a sucker to keep his money. <br />If you&#039;re playing a poker game and you look around the table and and can&#039;t tell who the sucker is, it&#039;s you. <br /><br />I am sure others on here from different countries have similar sayings.
