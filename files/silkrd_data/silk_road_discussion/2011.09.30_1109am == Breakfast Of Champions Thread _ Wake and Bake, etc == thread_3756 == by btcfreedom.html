				The only drugs I can handle first thing in the morning are weed... or... every once in a while, jumping right out of bed an takin&#039; a shot of H.<br /><br />Once I set my alarm early, then when I woke up, took some LSD and went right back to sleep. I thought maybe I could sleep and trip at the same time. Nope. I woke up an hour later and felt nothing. I had to go morning piss and by the time I reached the bottom of the stairs I was peaking. Fastest LSD peak ever.

				Ideal morning:<br /><br />10mg hydrocodne and a diet Coke<br />Big fat bong rip of whatever I have on hand, usually good midgrade to medi that has a ways to go.<br />10mg oxycodone insufflated<br /><br />Lately, every couple days I have been adding in 20 - 40mg of diazepam in the mix&nbsp; as I have been under a ton of emotional stress.<br /><br />Food doesn&#039;t usually make it in to me til mid-day. Probably what caused my ulcer&nbsp; :(

I don&#039;t know if they noticed i was fucked up or not. I do remember i was very agitated because something bad had happened that day, so maybe they wrote it off to emotional distess. <br /><br />Shocker came when i went to drive... i exited my carport just fine... no &quot;snake steering wheel&quot; or anything, all fine on the surface roads, then when i got to the expressway, BOOM, i felt as if i was on a surfboard riding a wave, the road came up to meet me and the lane lines looked like a stereo oscilloscope analyzing the music playing on my radio(mos def, kid cuddi and the likes). <br /><br /><br />now, my breakfast today? Some hash, half a viagra(just for kicks, a friend traded me a bunch for some coke) and my girl&#039;s tasty tasty pussy. first time i got to sleep with her since i got out of lockup for breaking curfew so it was QUITE enjoyable ;-)&nbsp; &nbsp;(to the ladies, sorry for the explicitness and objectification, but the post was authorized by my girl, hehe. I know she&#039;s the boss!)

				Mother of fuck! I&#039;m surprised drug testing companies never sued any of you for corroding their lab equipment hahah. Do y&#039;all throw on some Hunter S. Thompson sunglasses and drive to Vegas every morning? Damn, wheaties are for pussies. Unless they are made of shrooms and the milk is spiked with THC concentrates. If you can eat all that and still function during the day, there is a wheaties box cover out there waiting for you.<br /><br />As for me, I smoke *one* measly bowl of quality bud. That&#039;s it. OK, maybe 2-3 bowls if the weed is anything but fire, but really that&#039;s the only &quot;drug&quot; I do when I wake up. I don&#039;t even eat breakfast lol. Nighttime is a different story though. When trying to sleep, I&#039;ll smoke till I can&#039;t get any higher and take about 1mg of whatever benzo I have plus a small dose of hydrocodone or any other opiate I have laying around. Yeah, I&#039;m fucking hardcore man.

				Usually I just have a bowl of cereal and a cup of tea... or sometimes a cup of coffee if I&#039;m feeling really wild!! Lol. I try to restrict my caffeine intake due to suffering from insomnia.<br /><br />I can remember having to go into work countless times whilst coming down from Ecstasy or LSD. That was tough both physically and mentally, but I could pull it off because I was still quite young and my body seemed to be able to handle all-nighters back then. The job also wasn&#039;t particularly serious, just part-time retail in a quiet store. Couple of cans of Red Bull and a McMuffin and I was set to survive the day.<br /><br />One time I was still tripping quite hard and saw all kinds of fractals forming on the skin of my boss&#039; face. It was so difficult to act normal and interact with him (and the customers) without giving myself away!! Argh. Would never do that sort of thing again, my mind can&#039;t handle it.
