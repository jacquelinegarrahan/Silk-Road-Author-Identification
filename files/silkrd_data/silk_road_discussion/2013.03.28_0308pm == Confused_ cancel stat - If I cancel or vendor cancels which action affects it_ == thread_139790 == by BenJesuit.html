				I&#039;m in a situation where I&#039;m trying to keep my stats perfect. Been here more than a year and 100% perfect stats and well over 100 orders. I don&#039;t even want to<br />have anything upset that. So my question is:<br /><br />If I cancel and order, will it affect my stats?<br />If the vendor cancels my order instead, will it affect my stats?<br /><br />This is not in resolutions. I&#039;ve done that twice and receive a 100% refund for product never shipped and my refund rate remained at zero. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m over-thinking it because if I recall correctly, with purchasing stats, there&#039;s only total spent, # of purchases, refunds, auto-confirms. But does a cancel count as a refund since you&#039;re getting your money back? <br /><br />Help a brother out. :)

				I can only answer one part of your question for sure... If you cancel an order it does not affect your stats as I have done so in the past

				OK good. Got that part established. I also read that that&#039;s the case. Buyer cancels, Stats OK. <br /><br />I&#039;ve read feedback before where people were pissed at vendors for cancelling their order and stating it ruined their stats. <br /><br />So I don&#039;t want to be a dummy and ask the vendor to cancel and have my stats ruined when all I have to do is wait until the cancel button comes up. I guess that clears that up. Thank brother. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to be one of those buyers who demand a vendor to cancel then cry about how it ruined their stats. So that&#039;s why I asked to be sure. I&#039;ve only left a 1/5 once in all my time here. I&#039;m not going to leave this vendor a 1/5. That&#039;s a dick move. I&#039;m only losing time. He did his best I guess and kept me in the loop after a few pleasant PMs. I just want to use my funds elsewhere for a faster ship. <br /><br />You know, while reading feedback of various vendors to try to figure out the answer to me question, what is clear is that most buyers have no idea what it&#039;s like to be a vendor and they expect Amazon level of service with illegal gear. They really seem to take this place for granted. I see 4/5&#039;s because a package was a few days late. Or 1/5 because they didn&#039;t like the packaging but the product was good. Or the worst, leaving less than 5/5 for a free sample. LOL. Some vendors are bad apples sure. We know who they are, they always ask for FE. But a lot of buyers just don&#039;t get it. Man, this place is light years ahead of buying off the streets. Probably these buyers have no experience with buying off the streets so they don&#039;t have anything to contrast against. Would explain why they seem so entitled at times.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m rantin&#039;. Thanks for setting me straight.

				Cancels have no effect on stats at all. It is completely separate from a refund.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had orders cancelled on me multiple times, things happen. Thankfully there is no effect on stats because of that.

				Now I&#039;m confused again. So you&#039;re saying that cancels have no effect either way? Whether vendors do it or you do it.<br /><br />See, what&#039;s got me confused is reading feedback that says something like, &quot;Vendor cancelled my order and now my perfect stats are ruined.&quot; (Maybe the feedback is BS, which might be the case considering how some buyers like to leave overly negative feedback or the buyer could be the competition trying to scare away business.)<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t figure out how that was possible unless when a vendor cancels = a refund.

				i think those people are idiots who don&#039;t know how to access their stats and just like bitching because their order got cancelled. it&#039;s only refunds and auto finalises in the stats not cancellations.

				As I understand it, buyer receive same automated message from SR that order is canceled for ether refund on really cancelation by vendor.<br />So obviusly some buyer think its canceled when vendor issued an refund. System does not recognize this two actions and same auto pm is sent. Cancelation does not affect the stats and buyer mentioned earlier just were confused because that same auto SR message.

Some of the new vendors can go all &quot;rude boy&quot; on you. <br /><br />A few weeks ago, I asked a new vendor a question that was not on his vendor profile. How does he respond? &quot;Read the fucking front page!&quot;<br />So then I was like, &quot;You first. dumbass.&quot; <br /><br />We got on good terms after that. He explained that newbs kept asking him questions that were already answered on his page. Turns out he added the answer to my question on his page and he gave me a nice discount for sticking with him even after all that.<br /><br />The other thing we need is a feedback tutorial. There&#039;s only 1/5 &amp; 5/5. The ratings in between are for professional use only. If you got your drugs, 5/5. If it was late? 5/5 and say it was late in the comments. But you got your shit so STFU. Sellers risk their lives and freedom to get you your stuff.&nbsp; And if you didn&#039;t get your drugs or your drugs were super cut or fake, then 1/5. That&#039;s it.<br /><br />Funny seeing 3/5 because some damn newb thought it wasn&#039;t stealth enough. It got to you, didn&#039;t it? And if you order 5 more times it&#039;ll get to you again, 5 more times. Check the sellers feedback. Yeah, right, seller sold over 300 times probably using pretty much the same &quot;not stealthy enough&quot; packaging before your newb know nothing self came along. <br /><br />Man, I&#039;ve seen just about every kind of stealth. Even the kind were you&#039;re like, &quot;shit, fucker he got me.&quot; Until you dismantle it. Now really, was all that stealth necessary? No. <br />But my favorite is how sellers hide LSD. Some of it is just too damn cute. <br /><br />Anyway, thanks everybody for setting that straight. It&#039;s all good now.

				when you buy a product the bitcoins automatically are in the escrow system until the seller places it in transit or cancels or the buyer cancels. if it&#039;s cancelled then you get the full money back minus sr fee. if it does go into transit you&#039;d have to get a refund through resolution which would show on your stats.

When order has been placed in the transit(confirmed shipping), vendor can still cancel it with two options selections(never shipped or never arrived). Trough resolution there is full refund button and ordinary x percentage refund. For all that mentioned, for whatever action took place, same automated sr message is sent with notification about order cancelation e.g. pm does not separate were refund issued or simple cancellation.<br />Hope that helps.

				you are powerless in that situation unfortunately. do your research on that vendors efficiency or if it&#039;s not a really busy vendor pm them before to check they can get it out in a timeframe that&#039;s acceptable to you.

I believe the staff has in the past issued full refunds in cases where vendors have disappeared or tried to pull a scam but somehow left coins in their accounts to be refunded and have left buyers stats untouched because it was not the buyers fault in any way what so ever.

And other buyers reported the same on the forum. So I sent SR resolutions a link to the thread to back me up, pointed to the fact that the vendor hadn&#039;t logged on for so long his account went into vacation mode. SR gave me 100% refund. No ding to stats. <br /><br />2nd time vendor hadn&#039;t logged on for days, had no choice but to go to resolutions. Turns out he was arrested and was locked up for days until he could make bail. He logged on a day or so before SR has to make the &quot;5 day&quot; deliberation, and agreed to my refund. But no ding in stats.<br /><br />At first I thought that maybe the amount as was small relative to the amount I spent that it would have been a refund rate of .1%. And you know how SR rounds up ratings like when a vendor has a 99.7% rating, it shows as (100) until you click on the vendor&#039;s profile page. Yeah well, I asked SR staff if my stats reflected any refund. And they said no. <br /><br />Both of these were last year. Like Spring time.
