				First, where is my second thread about Nod trying to fix prices for Blow on SR?&nbsp; I swear till I cant post no more I will keep posting until my fucking fingers fall off.&nbsp; You can keep deleting the post, but you shady fucks will be exposed.&nbsp; This is complete bullshit that admins keep&nbsp; deleting facts and the truth about what Vendors are trying to pull.&nbsp; BTW has anyone seen Nods prices on Blow?&nbsp; All the sudden they have fallen by 100.00 bucks on coke.&nbsp; Admins are in on it too, as by how posts keep getting deleted.

				Guys we need to keep this thread alive if we want to show how the admins, vendors, and mods are in on the price fixing.&nbsp; Only you will be able to drive down prices.

				Let the drama be play out.<br />You won, at least I think you did. Post away!<br /><br />Any kind of price fixing is over for the moment.<br />Next time they will be more discrete. Are some drugs that hard to get? Guess I haven&#039;t tried them all.<br />The coke market can be price fixed? I don&#039;t get it? Some of you people should not get high on your supply.<br />Or... change drugs. I know it helped me 8)

				Okay guys, the fix is in!<br /><br />I am forming a cartel and I have DPR,s written permission (see his thread on the subject)<br /><br />Here&#039;s how the cartel works, see... We all sell everything we can for the highest possible price we can based on our reputations and on how fast and successfully we deliver.<br /><br />Got it? <br /><br />Okay now GO!<br /><br />Modzi

				Ha, coke was already way overpriced to me when I first joined SR over a year ago. Oh well, the nature of it leads itself to this kind of activity. I&#039;m going to enjoy watching this unfold... I really don&#039;t get the incentive to be a part of the cartel though. Why not use your established reputation to undercut the game and reap the rewards. What is the cartel going to do? Come after you? That would be a neat trick.<br /><br />To the people complaining, a product is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. Easier said than done for many, sure, but you can always take your business elsewhere.

				An SR cartel simply cannot last due to the Prisoners&#039; Dilemma, a short (subjective) while after they form, one will &quot;defect/betray&quot; the others be it via a new account that is not part of the cartel, or just blatantly lower their prices slightly in relation to the cartel&#039;s.
