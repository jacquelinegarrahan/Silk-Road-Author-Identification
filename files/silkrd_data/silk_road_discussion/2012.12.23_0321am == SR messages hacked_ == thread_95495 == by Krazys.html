Frankly, the best practice is to assume that the SR Forum and/or SR proper are either hacked, or are under surveillance.&nbsp; That is why you should be using PGP for all communications, even trivial ones. <br /><br />NC<br />

When it comes to security, people do NOT want to learn new things, they do not wish to go outside of their comfort zones. User laziness is the single biggest asset that law enforcement has to use against a community like Silk Road. Unfortunately, in the real world, sometimes people have to be _forced_ to do the right thing.&nbsp; To believe otherwise is nothing but a Libertarian pipe-dream. <br /><br />NC<br />

				So does this mean SR is hacked again? Can you ask the vendor to copy and paste the message here so we can all take a look, If the hackers are at it again and this time the have control of our messages it may do more damage then the picture hack. We need more info!

				I know exactly what I sent in each case as my messages were written on notepad then c&amp;p&#039;s in. And before anyone gets too upset with me having copies of SR correspondences on hand? They are never longer than 2-3 sentences, never explicit, and if someone finds and cracks my encrypted external drive they will be the least of my worries.

				Wouldnt it be more likely that Krazy has been targeted or his information phished?<br />Im not familiar with the ways of hackers, but it seems like the nature of the &quot;message hack&quot; is awfully specific. I received a message from a vender, not encrypted, with no changes or interruptions in the past 6 hours. Just my feelin.

Prudence demands that we hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. <br /><br />3. As such, it would be wise to consider the SR messaging system untrusted. All communications sent via this medium should be encrypted, as a countermeasure. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. All users of the SR messaging system should maintain a state of heightened vigilance, and be alert for modified/altered messages. <br /><br />5. New keys should be considered untrusted, unless they can be somehow verified out of band (i.e. via another medium.) <br /><br />NC<br /><br />

Maybe a bit of legacy code left in from when the site was being constructed, lots of devs put bits in and forget to take them out when the site goes from beta to live. an example message scrubbers are often tested by getting them to change the content of a message, content filtering systems replace certain words with other text.. Finished does not need to mean SR is over, it could have meant the site is completed in a few days. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Excellent point.&nbsp; If what you described was in place, then it only stands to reason that someone sending an identical message as Krazy should receive an identically-altered message.&nbsp; So, I setup two SR accounts, and sent an identical message Krazy sent to his supplier and observed the results.&nbsp; <br /><br />In this particular instance, the only change that was observed can be chalked-up to automated replacement was the replacement of &quot;&gt;&quot; (greater-than) signs with &amp;gt; which is to be expected in HTML markup. Again, no changes, of any other kind, were observed. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95495.msg680177#msg680177">Quote from: fuckingACE on December 24, 2012, 07:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">2. The messages are not being changed by a person, the fact that the behavior is consistent proves that. There is an application or an existing part of the messaging system that reads the content of the messages and replaces certain content with other content. AV systems on messaging servers do this regularly... &quot;your attachment is too large&quot; or &quot;this language is inappropriate for corporate email&quot; or disclaimer texts.. etc.. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That has not proven to be the case. My tests have shown no alterations other than would be expected with normal, expected HTML markup. That does not account for the other changes that Krazy (and his vendor) have reported. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95495.msg680177#msg680177">Quote from: fuckingACE on December 24, 2012, 07:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">3. If they had access to this, and it is a hacker, then they have the ability to spoof messages, and create rules to edit/remove/add text.. but cannot read on the fly only once delivered. The rules to edit/remove and append would need to be created before the message is sent. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think this is supposition -- at present, we do not know for certain whether an intruder made these changes and, if so, at what stage the changes were made. If there indeed is an intruder, we do not as yet know their capabilities. I think it is too early to start making assumption as to what an intruder can or cannot do, assuming they exist in the first place. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95495.msg680177#msg680177">Quote from: fuckingACE on December 24, 2012, 07:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">4. I really hope the messaging system is on a dedicated server<br /><br />ACE<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Let&#039;s hope so. <br /><br />After some reflection, my thoughts are as follows: <br /><br />1. We do not know for certain whether or not an intruder has gained access to the SR messaging system, or whether what has happened is due to some other cause. <br /><br />2. Prudence demands that we hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. <br /><br />3. As such, it would be wise to consider the SR messaging system untrusted. All communications sent via this medium should be encrypted, as a countermeasure. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. All users of the SR messaging system should maintain a state of heightened vigilance, and be alert for modified/altered messages. <br /><br />5. New keys should be considered untrusted, unless they can be somehow verified out of band (i.e. via another medium.) <br /><br />NC<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Thanks for your intelligent analysis :)<br /><br />BG<br />

				Has anyone tried sending the exact message OP claims to have sent?<br /><br />No one else seems to be having this problem, so either the supposed hack--which sorta looks like an example of SQL injection form output pulled from a textbook--is not affecting most SR users at this time, or nothing has been compromised and this has some other explanation. I guess it could be more disruptive FUD aimed at making SR more difficult to use. If you have to PGP every single message now as a result of the paranoia, that would be a bitch!

Look only at the bitcoin reseller who had some person plaintext him their phone number AND address. Guess both of those things are needed?<br /><br />If you can stir up enough doubt in the minds of the common user you don&#039;t even have to take down the source because all their clients will bail on them. Sort of how they cracked the whip on megaupload and every other clearnet upload service shit their pants in unison. <br /><br />Just make it so the average user can&#039;t be involved, the tech savvy user and/or the user with connections that aren&#039;t online will be involved either way.

				OK, yeah that makes sense. SR&#039;s message code may have been patched, and now special characters aren&#039;t being handled properly. &quot;They&quot; probably saw that and just ran with it lol.<br /><br />@ontheregs: I agree 100%. Most of SR&#039;s buyers aren&#039;t even on the forums. Many are lucky that tor comes neatly bundled for them these days, as I doubt they can spell PGP let alone use it.

Because if Krazys is lying...<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95495.msg682028#msg682028">Quote from: ontheregs on December 25, 2012, 10:59 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is it wrong to think that maybe a screenshot even though it could be easily edited anyways or a word from the vendor he claims was involved in this could go further in proving if it really is happening?<br /><br />I&#039;m just not sure I believe that there is some clever hacker sitting around looking to inject into just a few random buyers messages.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">3.

Just keep educating people on PGP and hopefully if something really does become widespread with the messaging system, it wouldn&#039;t be a huge deal.<br /><br />If people are falling for that guy that changes the wikipedia link though maybe a little fear-mongering is enough to stop some people from ordering?.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It is easy to fake a screen-shot. I could fake one up in a few minutes without a problem.&nbsp; As far as we can tell, and given that SR&#039;s security appears to be quite good, there is no problem. This means that Krazys remembers it wrong or, since Krazys has gone to such lengths to show his &quot;original message&quot;, that Krazys is flat-out lying. If he is lying, that means he is LE and this is just psy-ops. Or trolling. {Blargh retracts the following: Nightcrawler&#039;s suggestions are crap, though.}<br /><br />The messaging system should ALWAYS be considered unsafe. None of SR should be considered safe. Take fucking care, people. But still, Krazys appears to be lying, or LE.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Send this <br />&quot;So glad that you are up and running with this. I will order as soon as my $ ---&gt; ฿ ---&gt; my Silk Road account. &quot;<br /><br />to someone and see what they receive. <br />ACE<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The only thing verified and replicated, from my side, is that &quot;&gt;&quot; becomes &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;. That isn&#039;t what I was talking about. I was talking about the other, far more significant parts of Krazys&#039; claim. The ones about the message actually changing?<br /><br />So now you&#039;ve got the ball. Did anything else get fucked up?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I did the same and the only changes I notices were the transformatin of &gt; to &amp;gt; as one would expect.&nbsp; No other changes observed<br /><br />NC<br />.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Just one more confirmation on the &quot;Krazys is LE/psyops&quot; theory, as far as I&#039;m concerned. :)
