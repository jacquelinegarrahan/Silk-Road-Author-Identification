				Worst communication ever !!! Claims these are perfect ID&#039;s .. And you know what <br />they are pretty good quality. So I ordered 3, thought I would give this guy a good start <br />with his business. I get them 5 days later and I am so excited because I live in one of the <br />states he offers and really could of used these. SO I GET THESE ID&#039;S AND THE FUCKING <br />COLORS ARE DIFFERENT. THE COLOR BEHIND MY PICTURE IS WAY LIGHTER<br />AND THE ID NUMBER IS WAY LIGHTER THEN WHAT THEY SHOULD BE. So I <br />message the vendor thinking a man of his trade will for sure fix the color scheme and send me <br />what I ordered. LOL. He says its good enough and will not send me anything else. Thanks for <br />making my life harder and now I cant use them. I pleaded with the vendor and he shot me down.<br /><br />Beware this vendor is only here to make his money. If you are not satisfied HE DOES NOT <br />GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR SAFETY. IT&#039;S NOT THE MONEY CAUSE I HAVE PLENTY <br />OF IT BUT COME ON Havemeier (HAVE RESPECT AND WORRY ABOUT YOUR CLIENTS <br />SAFETY AND YOU WILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. BUT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN<br />CAUSE I BEGGED YOU TO HELP ME AND YOU DIDN&#039;T CARE.<br /><br />SR community please dont write about how I&#039;m a scammer and want these id&#039;s for nothing <br />please know I am probably going to have to pay for these anyway but now I will have something <br />I cant use. <br /><br />ANY THOUGHTS COMMUNITY .........&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(<br /><br />

				Sounds like a serious flaw that the vendor could have and should have avoided.

				I have not yet cause it just happened, but I am in the process of adding it to resolution. <br /><br />THE MESSAGE BELOW IS WHAT I SENT HIM AT FIRST :<br />_______________________________________________________________________________<br />Hey Havemeier,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try and stay professional as you have been courteous to me thus far. So being<br />from Florida I would hope we could get the colors correct in the ID&#039;s.<br /><br />The blue the picture is on does not match the originals also the license number is in a different<br />color as well. I could understand if I was not in Florida maybe it would pass, but you know I&#039;m in<br />the same state and these ID&#039;s just wont do. The good news is the centering and the holograms<br />are very nice and the quality is very good, I just cant use them if the colors don&#039;t match. I am<br />still in need of the ID&#039;s and I hope you will be willing to send me 3 others. Please get back to me<br />asap.<br /><br />Loyal1<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />HE RESPONDS WITH <br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />The basic fact is, when people see hundreds of real Florida IDs a day, no matter how perfect it is, I always recommend out of state. Every DMV printer in Florida is configured differently and thus the color is different from DMV to DMV. The ID you have is completely different from another printed in Florida in a different location or even a different time at the same place. Nevertheless people use these in Florida all day long for purposes beyond underage alcohol consumption.<br /><br />Regards,<br />H.<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />HE BLAMES ALL DMV PRINTERS ARE DIFFERENT.&nbsp; &nbsp;THIS IS NOT TRUE THEY ARE ALL THE SAME <br />THEY HAVE TO BE.&nbsp; &nbsp;SHOULD I POST PICTURES OF THE DIFFERENCES?

				I RESPOND WITH <br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry my man, that response is not good enough. I&#039;m sure by the picture you can tell I don&#039;t need this<br />ID for underage drinking LOL. I wont go into detail on why I need the ID but I&#039;m sure someone in your trade<br />would offer perfection for a client who is trying to use a fake ID and not send below average product so your<br />client would get in trouble.<br /><br />Sorry we could not work this out and we will have to take this to resolution.<br /><br />Loyal1 <br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />HE RESPONDS WITH <br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />You seriously are trying to scam me on money because you are too good to use my product? People use them all day long for the same purposes you do in FL. I manufacture 3 products, express mail them, and then you try and not pay me. This is absurd. There is nothing that can be done to change the product. If you wanted someone else&#039;s product, you should have done that. I made it incredibly clear the quality and safety features of the product, which you received. And now you are just trying to throw it back in my face.<br /><br />Regards,<br />H.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />THEN I GET NASTY CAUSE I KNOW HE DOESN&#039;T AND WONT CARE ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY

				I just don&#039;t think he has his shit straight to be honest. I&#039;ve ordered numerous things on SR and have never had this much trouble. I ordered the Florida ID in late December and have yet to receive anything. His communication is spotty. For every two messages I send him I can finally expect one back. I&#039;ve had to extend due date twice so far and it has been several weeks with nothing in the mail. It&#039;s not the end of the world and I don&#039;t really even care if the quality is 100% for my purposes, but I just don&#039;t like having 100$ in escrow for that long because I hate having nothing to show for spent cash. He is very nice when he does respond and agreed to send me a free duplicate. Also during communication he asked to confirm my address and sent me some random person&#039;s address directly on SR private message without PGP. So who knows if he has sent my address unencrypted somewhere on here. Nevertheless, I don&#039;t think this guy is a scammer or anything. His product is almost half the price of most other fake IDs on SR so that&#039;s what you get! Been waiting too long though. Sloppy vendoring. Who knows could just be a rough patch + there was the holidays.<br /><br /><br />that&#039;s just my experience...

				So what happened? Did you ever get what you ordered? I just ordered one today. Thought I&#039;d give it a shot because this FL ID would be very useful for me. I&#039;m not worried about exact colors, either. Please update with your experience, petigrewdrew.

				And Loyal1, I just want to say that saying that havemeier is a scammer, when he sent what you admit is a decent ID, is way out of bounds. If you aren&#039;t happy with it, fine. Let your opinion be known. But after all it is only a C note, and he sent a decent ID in 5 freakin&#039; days. To make a post that blatantly says he is a scammer is absolutely the wrong thing to do, imo. Scammers are playing games and stealing people&#039;s coins and giving nothing in return. It doesn&#039;t sound like havemeier even comes close to that description. My 2 cents. No need to respond if you don&#039;t agree.

				I just got my Havemeier Florida ID today. This ID is top quality, for the money. I don&#039;t see how it wouldn&#039;t fool even the most discerning clerk or doorman. To call Havemeier a scammer after receiving an ID of this quality if freaking idiotic. Don&#039;t hesitate to order from Havemeier. He&#039;s the real thing.
