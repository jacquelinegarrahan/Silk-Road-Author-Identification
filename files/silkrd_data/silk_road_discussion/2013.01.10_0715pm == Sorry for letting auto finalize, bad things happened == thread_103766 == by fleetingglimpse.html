				First off let me apologize to all those who i let auto finalize over the festive period. :(<br /><br />I had a family death on Christmas day so this was really the last thing on my mind, so sorry again and it destroyed my good stats. But purchasing stats are the least of my concerns to be honest, but please dont be deterred from dealing with me.<br /><br />I never received some packages and obviously there is not a lot i can do about it now, but i am in discussions with the vendors, which i appreciate them doing :) <br /><br />Sorry again.<br /><br />Peace and good will to all, may your new year be better than mine began!<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />fg&nbsp; :(<br />

				That is real unfortunate my man. I hope you can get back to the normal grind soon. I&#039;m sure your brothers here on the road will take care of you. If you ever need to vent or anything, you can always pm me. I am trained for that sort of thing from back in my academic days.<br /><br />Keep on keeping on and don&#039;t forget to smile, your deceased loved ones would like that.

				Hey, just an update on this. <br /><br />2 of the vendors who&#039;s packages never arrived have agreed a reship, which i think is awesome and i appreciate it very much. Iv not received anything yet but its early doors. I will name them, it they like, and kiss their feet if it comes through :D Big up to them.<br /><br />Another has disappeared and is refusing to answer to answer messages so i think iv been done, I&#039;ll name them too if i dont hear anything soon. They were relatively new so a bit of a risk, but i wasn&#039;t expecting what happened to happen so i thought the risk was acceptable. And after reading some of the forum posts on them they seem suspect!!<br /><br />Cheers to BG, still doing business together and looking forward to my stuff ;D<br /><br />Keep updated<br /><br />fg

				Good post! I too am sorry for your loss.<br /><br />This is a good example of what to so when something go&#039;s to auto-finalize. As that is the worst thing for a vendor and is uncalled for except for situations like this. And you can make up for it with a simple I am sorry and a explanation of why and that it will not happen again.<br /><br />Make sure you out the scumbag, shit ball, fucking loser Vendor that is now not taking your messages. Also shout out the ones that worked with you. <br /><br />Nothing worse then placing an order and not getting it...but they got the money...and now they will not return your messages. Can not stand shit bag vendors and we as a community need to weed them out ASAP. Vendors need to be on top of their game at all times. Customer service is a MUST.<br /><br />Hope everything works out and again sorry for your loss.
