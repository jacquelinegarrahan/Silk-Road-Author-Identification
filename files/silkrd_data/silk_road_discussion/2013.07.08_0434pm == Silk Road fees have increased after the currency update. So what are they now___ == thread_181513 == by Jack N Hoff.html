				This guy is 100% right but the other vendor tries to blame it on rounding errors. ::)&nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181490<br /><br />Rounding errors do not cause fees to double...<br /><br />I haven&#039;t bothered to ask about it until now but I&#039;m actually quite curious as to what the new fees are.<br /><br />So these were the fees before the recent &quot;currency update.&quot;<br /><br />$0 - 50 -&gt; 10%<br />$50 - 150 -&gt; 8.5%<br />$150 - 300 -&gt; 6%<br />$300 - 500 -&gt; 3%<br />$500 - 1000 -&gt; 2%<br />$1000+ -&gt; 1.5%<br /><br />My $2,500 pre fee listing was $2,540 to $2,550 before this recent &quot;currency update.&quot;&nbsp; My listing now costs $2,600.70 after this &quot;currency update.&quot;&nbsp; So the fees on $1,000+ listings have doubled.&nbsp; <br /><br />What are the fees now?

				This is what is happening....<br /><br />Before the bitcoin crash no vendor was hedging because vendors were making a profit off the crazy rise of bitcoin.&nbsp; Well once it crashed everyone started hedging their shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;And as bitcoins continue to fall SR is taking a beating.&nbsp; &nbsp;So the vendor fees went up so they can continue to make money.&nbsp; &nbsp;This doesn&#039;t answer your question on what they are now.. this is just why.

				It would have been courteous to let vendors know that the fees were going up! DPR and the SR staff must be a busy group of people, but common courtesy goes along way, especially when vendors have loyal customers, who are now seeing the prices of their orders rise, without explanation :)

				Here&#039;s the SR Support response to my inquiry on the commission fee change;<br /><br /><br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent a message out to all active sellers about this before the update. The entire system is now bitcoin centric, so the commission is based off of the bitcoin price. Because of the volatility of the price of bitcoins relative to other currencies, the commission will be changed from time to time to accommodate. If you&#039;d like to know the commission on any of your listings, you can set your account to pre-commission pricing and compare the price on your listed items page to the price seen on the item page, just make sure you have the same currency selected for viewing and pegging prices. Please keep in mind that it can take up to an hour for the price on the item page to update.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read&nbsp; delete<br /><br />Crazy Eights(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please confirm SR&#039;s new fee structure for Sellers as we&#039;ve not seen any announcements<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />ce

				I did not get a notification email either - highly discourteous. And seemingly out of character for DPR - at least the character I have formed in my mind from reading his posts.<br /><br />There are a few things that are also odd about the response apparently from DPR posted above:<br /><br />&quot;...is based off of the bitcoin price.&quot; is not the kind of English he used to speak.<br /><br />&quot;Because of the volatility of the price of bitcoins relative to other currencies, the commission will be changed from time to time to accommodate&quot; does not make any sense at all. It&#039;s a commission, so it&#039;s not affected by the volatility of exchange rates. Accommodate what exactly??<br /><br />Why should vendors have to &quot;work out&quot; their commission? This is something so fundamental to our business relationship that it should be transparently and explicitly communicated at all times. Ideally there should be a permanent link to the current commission schedule.<br /><br />To not inform at all, and then to suggest that vendors have been told when they haven&#039;t been (seems pretty clear that no-one has seen a notification) is very off on both counts - once again very un-DPR like.<br /><br />Fuck sakes we&#039;re running a business based on margins - this is not trivial information. Those running post-commission pricing are earning less than they think, and the customers of those running pre-commission pricing are wondering why the fuck all the prices just went up. Either way it&#039;s highly unprofessional.<br /><br />Something smells not quite kosher here in my opinion...<br /><br />BG

				I just read through this whole thread.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t take much for some of you to start slinging accusations does it?<br /><br />Apparently the message I sent out to vendors did not go through.&nbsp; It explained the effect of the new currency pegging system to them, as well as how to set their accounts so that the change in commission would affect their prices in the way they wanted.&nbsp; I apologize that it did not through.&nbsp; Next time I send a message to all of the vendors, I&#039;ll double check.<br /><br />The commission has always been opaque to buyers and vendors have the option to use pre or post commission pricing so they can control how their products are priced in the market, or how much they get in payment.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why some of you are offended by this change and thinking there is some kind of conspiracy going on.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always reserved the right to change the commission at any time and sellers have the tools they need to control how their payments are affected by changes in the commission.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, to some of you saying things like &quot;it&#039;s tripled&quot;, your math is wrong, try again.&nbsp; You are comparing two different types of commission schedules.<br /><br />Tesselated, according to your post it sounds like you had your listings set to post-commission pricing.&nbsp; As stated in the Seller&#039;s Guide, if you want to ensure you are paid a specific amount, you must choose pre-commission pricing.&nbsp; If there is something else going on, feel free to pm me.

I really dont know, I doubt t would have happened, but who am i to know? I am a mere pawn in the whole game. But things are definetely going down.. Its impossible for things not to, time changes so must technology, Im not sure what, But i try to think about it this way, before Sr there were ways of getting drugs , Now theres SR, and i hope there will be ways afterwards. <br /><br />Its our job as a community to keep this place alive. I hope it wont self destruct from the inside out with people getting all &quot;conspiricy theory&quot; on it.

				I think conspiracy is a strong word but looking at it from the perspective of Atlantis, if I were them I&#039;d go ahead and run with the FUD and say &quot;our commission rates are lower than Silk Road, and aren&#039;t subject to mysterious and unannounced changes.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m getting paid the same regardless, so I could care less.

				Having done the calculations (Vendors, see vendor section), the majority of vendors wouldn&#039;t even notice the change. It&#039;s actually quite minor to very slightly in the vendor&#039;s favor for listings $500 and under. Listings between $500 to $1000, it&#039;s a few dollars more. We&#039;re talking about $1 to $8 increase or so. But after $1000, the fees go up a lot. Both in percentage terms and dollar terms. But not enough to significantly impact profit margins at bulk pricing. <br /><br />For instance, a $1500 listing will have a new commission of ~ $62. Under the old schedule, the same $1500 listing was $46. That&#039;s a $16 increase. Can&#039;t imagine that&#039;s going to really hurt any vendor with listings at this level. If margins are *that* tight at this price level, small BTC fluctuations would be killer. <br /><br />

				Every time I buy I spend about 15k. Now I have to spend 15, 300. This increased&nbsp; an extra 300 FUCKING DOLLARS OVERNIGHT. <br /><br /><br />I am pissed. And what else pisses me off is that they let scammers stay here even after they know they are scammers just to get increased revenue then they dump them when everyone is freaking out. They continue to BS us and say they will look into it, well when they see the vendor is down to 70%, they still let them go for an extra day or two. I am personally going to tell my vendors to start vending to me on Atlantis. Sorry SR, I have spent FAR to much. This is a slippery slope.<br /><br /><br />

				Like I said before it isn&#039;t a matter of money. A vendor can still receive his base price + commission and plan and adjust accordingly. What was troubling is the few days of uncertainty and no clarification. Rumors, whether substantiated or not thrive on the internet; especially in an anonymous forum full of paranoids and delinquents. <br /><br />Fear, uncertainty and doubt run rampant if left unchecked. <br /><br />In regards to commission algorithms, I ain&#039;t got time for that shit. <br /><br />If I at anytime sounded insinuating DPR I apologize. Thanks for the opportunity to use your creation to fuel my deviant lifestyle and give me a source of income and an ego boosting sense of self-satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Holy shit this thread blew up! Get out of the life-rafts and calm down, the ship isn&#039;t sinking.<br /><br /><br />From a vendor perspective I can tell you that the SR is well worth it. I would pay much much more in fees before I stopped selling here.<br /><br /><br />SR allows vendors to hedge their escrow. I can not express how important of a feature this is - without it either escrow wouldn&#039;t be possible, or selling drugs for bitcoins wouldn&#039;t be possible. As a vendor if you set per-commission pricing then you get a guarantee that you will get paid that exact USD amount, in bitcoins, when the buyer finalizes. You really can&#039;t get screwed. No other site offers this feature and I doubt they could.<br /><br /><br />As a vendor you don&#039;t have to let DPR know every time you change your product price or do something that will effect his bottom line. On the other hand, as he stated in the Seller&#039;s Guide, he is allowed to do the same. We provide the drugs and customer support, he keeps the storefront open, provides escrow, and deals with everything we don&#039;t know how to do. Each link in the chain has its own value and each of us is allowed to price our piece of the pie as we see fit. It is up to the customers to decide whether the whole package is worth their bitcoins or not.<br /><br /><br /><br />There really isn&#039;t anything to see here. It is interesting to note the change in fees, but not that interesting.

				Here is a little more commission history...<br /><br /><br /><br />September 2011: What do you think about the new SR SELLER COMMISSION that&#039;s coming up?&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3415.0<br /><br />&quot;This is an automated message to all Silk Road sellers:<br /><br />Some of you are just joining us as sellers, others have been here since the beginning. Wherever you came into this game, I hope you are having fun :) For those just coming in, I want to give you a little history.<br /><br />Starting out, there were no commissions on sales. Sellers got 100% of what the buyer paid and there wasn&#039;t even a fee to become a seller! This might sound great for sellers, but paradoxically, I think things got much better when we started charging for accounts and adding a commission. Why? Because buyers had more reason to trust you and do business with you, and Silk Road finally had a revenue stream to invest in advanced server security and feature development.<br /><br />When we started charging a commission, I just picked a number, something like 5.25%. This was added on to every sale, so that sellers got what they listed the item for and buyers only saw one price. I was hoping this would give me the flexibility to change the commission rate at will without too much fuss from the community, but I soon found that many cared very much about this number, especially when I raised it by 1% to 6.25%.<br /><br />From my perspective, I would like this number to be as high as possible without causing sales to drop for you, but I have no idea where that point is. It could be 5%, 10% or even 20%, I just don&#039;t know. I&#039;m not saying we&#039;re amazon.com, but they charge a 15% commission on every item plus a flat $1.25 and I think ebay charges something like 13% if you take into account all of their fees.<br /><br />So, my proposal is to run an experiment. We&#039;ve been tracking sales data very closely for months and we&#039;re showing fairly steady linear growth. What I&#039;d like to do is double the commission rate to 12.5% for 1 month and see how sales respond to this. If our rate of growth slows, or even shrinks, then at least we&#039;ll know that it is too much and can scale it back, but if it doesn&#039;t affect sales, then we&#039;ll have doubled our revenue without any major consequence and can start investing in some of our &quot;back-burner&quot; projects such as internationalizing the site, developing an api, possibly starting an insurance pool, and getting normal updates and features online faster.<br /><br />This change will begin in 3 days unless I hear an overwhelming number of you respond negatively against it. Thanks for your time and for making Silk Road great :)<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road staff&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Jan 2012: State of the Road Address http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.msg76738#msg76738<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.msg76738#msg76738">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on January 09, 2012, 03:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />- From it&#039;s humble beginnings, the Silk Road market was quickly populated with what has become a vibrant community full of interesting characters.&nbsp; From our superstar vendors and ever helpful mods to all of the active folks on the forum, the people here are truly awesome.&nbsp; Silk Road would not be what it is or possibly even exist without everyone who has stepped up along the way to point out security flaws, contribute their ideas, and take this experiment on as their own and stand with us.<br /><br />It didn&#039;t take long before word got out.&nbsp; Our little hidden market got the attention of the media and soon the politicians and law enforcement.&nbsp; But Silk Road was never meant to be private and exclusive.&nbsp; It is meant to grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.&nbsp; We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so far tens of thousands have done so in the Silk Road market.&nbsp; A revolution has been born.&nbsp; So ideally, more participants means more prosperity.&nbsp; What we&#039;ve found in practice is that if there is an opportunity to cheat, steal or lie for personal short-term gain, someone, somewhere will exploit it.<br /><br />So, we&#039;ve had two major challenges to face as Silk Road grows and evolves.&nbsp; One is making our systems tough enough and flexible enough to withstand and win a cyber-war with the most powerful organizations in the world, should they choose to start that war.&nbsp; This is always and ever a top priority.&nbsp; The other is making the market a place where people can quickly and easily buy and sell just about anything without worrying about being attacked by gun toting men in uniforms and thrown in a cage or worry about being ripped off by their trading partner.<br /><br />I am proud to say we have been successful in achieving these goals up to this point.&nbsp; The site remains up and functioning (despite a few screw ups on our part, like not having a full capacity backup server ready to go when a live server went down, and a poorly executed url switch, just to name a few).&nbsp; And, over 99% of all transactions conducted within the escrow system are completed to the satisfaction of both both buyer and seller, or a mutually agreed upon resolution is found.<br /><br />This success has in no way made us complacent however.&nbsp; New members are still being lured into trading outside of escrow by scammers and getting ripped off, and “finalizing early”, effectively cutting out the escrow process, is common practice.&nbsp; Still, I believe we can mitigate these risks and take our market to the next level in security, reliability, performance, and convenience for everyone involved.<br /><br />First we must deal with trading out of escrow.&nbsp; Up to this point we have charged a flat 6.23% commission on all trades.&nbsp; This is much too high for transactions in the $300 and over range, making trading out of escrow for large transactions much more attractive than staying within the system.&nbsp; Now, instead of charging a flat commission, we will charge a higher amount for low priced items and a lower amount for high priced items, similar to how eBay does it.<br /><br />We&#039;ve worked hard to come up with a commission schedule that should work for everyone and will give scammers no excuse to make people send money outside of escrow.&nbsp; For some perspective, eBay and amazon charge the following rates:<br /><br />eBay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- $0.50 to list, 11% of the first $50, 6% of $50.01-1000, 2% of $1000.01+<br />amazon - $1.35 + 15% (for almost all items)<br /><br />We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.&nbsp; The average response looked like this:<br /><br />15% of the first $10<br />11% of $10 - $50<br />8.14% of $50 - $250<br />5.6% of $250 - $1000<br />3.7% of $1000 - $5000<br /><br />We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:<br /><br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /><br />With this change, there are no phoney excuses whatsoever for vendors to ask for out of escrow payment.&nbsp; Any request should be interpreted as a scam attempt and reported to the Silk Road support team via the “contact us” link on the main site.&nbsp; We are looking at several mechanisms for enforcing the ban on OOE transactions, from self-policing to bounties on offenders.<br /><br />Together, we can beat the scammers and make the Silk Road market a place where you can buy with confidence and peace of mind.&nbsp; If we stay true to our principles of integrity, virtue, mutual respect and camaraderie that have guided us to this point, I believe our future is bright and this revolutionary experiment will be a success!<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQEbBAEBAgAGBQJPCl0BAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olWDsH9jGBcHVl302TYnOpD/oc2G9w<br />ZN1H56v/oRww3het2ESSUokjfoU3JFs5442eNvvNQohHlN3Z2gVBpm4c7BQKVBTB<br />IlfjalIMr1bzMtjVzvwV+CJSF7KHrz91eUDICtpOgNIVQ36CxYA1c9cjHuOVVNbU<br />6N6qVycC4TS2Oy38DUJlYm5UsLcxTqQhlLkiXuUH3uOMp7pwLfPlDmrz4nojWooq<br />FwQ6JBFuMG5/wO0NcKgP4hXWcAmo24oGbaC6/5jUjQ7ze7ILsZf7ykeOi3O3ZhyG<br />n2WyY5+99dc39kviJhIwQfvu8VWaDlYBgvh3PlDENIYD4ThgAzdUoW0Nha4LXA==<br />=wI/M<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />CLARIFICATION:&nbsp;

I chose the words I wrote in the Address very carefully.&nbsp; I reviewed it many times.&nbsp; Every one of them is true, and my sentiment is valid.&nbsp; Go through and re-read it along with the clarifications.&nbsp; Every one of your concerns is addressed if you would only do me the courtesy of believing me.&nbsp; This change IS about scam prevention.&nbsp; We ARE working on solutions to the finalizing early and bitcoin exchange scams.&nbsp; We DID do everything we could to keep the rates low while still addressing the present and future needs of the organization.&nbsp; Everyone WILL be treated fairly under the new rules just as you have been all along.<br /><br />We also need to be WAY more flexible on this kind of stuff.&nbsp; It would be amazing if we could try out lots of different commission rates, some way too high, some way too low, to try to find out what works for everyone, but the minute we even mention changing rates everyone becomes an expert on the subject and puts up resistance to change.&nbsp; There is lots about this organization that just isn&#039;t going to be made public and you have to TRUST us that we are doing our absolute best and will always work toward our stated goals, which include giving people the opportunity to choose freedom over tyranny, and to trade in just about any good or service they wish, securely and privately.&nbsp; Our goals DO NOT include profiting personally at anyone else&#039;s expense, or the expense of our stated goals.&nbsp; If I am greedy, I am greedy for freedom.&nbsp; I am greedy for power.&nbsp; Not force over others, but for a world where POWER resides in me and each and every individual, where it belongs.&nbsp; If we can get to that world, I can die happy.<br /><br />Silk Road is an ENTERPRISE that is just getting started.&nbsp; It could literally change the world as we know it.&nbsp; It is bigger than any one of us, and it is going to take the dedication and will of MANY talented people, a lot of luck, and RESOURCES to get from here to there.&nbsp; Do you want to see this thing go all the way and take the absolute piss out of the power mongers of this world?&nbsp; Do you want to give it every chance it needs to succeed?&nbsp; Why aren&#039;t you telling me to raise the commission even further then?&nbsp; I don&#039;t hear anyone refusing the commission break on high priced goods.&nbsp; I don&#039;t hear anyone saying “don&#039;t do that, you need it, you keep this whole thing going, we&#039;re happy to do our part.”<br /><br />As a community, if we are going to survive, we need to adopt a LONG TERM vision.&nbsp; Getting the most out of this thing before it gets taken down is NOT going to bring us success.&nbsp; In that world, Silk Road will be a&nbsp; shooting star that burns out quickly and dies as little more than a dream, swallowed by the nightmare reality of an ever-expanding, all-powerful global oligarchy.&nbsp; Planning ahead and doing everything we can NOW to prepare for the war to come is the only way we are going to have a shot at this.&nbsp; We are still mostly ignored by our true enemies, but this incubation WILL NOT last forever.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like writing this kind of stuff publicly because it taunts our enemies and might spur them into action, but I risk it because the context for what we are doing is too often lost in the day to day stuff that happens here and it needs to be put in from time to time.&nbsp; Silk Road NEEDS our support.&nbsp; It needs everything we have.&nbsp; The return on what we put into it will be immeasurable if we can get through the months and years ahead and gain a real foothold on the global stage.&nbsp; HELP ME GET US THERE!!!&nbsp; Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind.<br /><br />P.S.<br />Here&#039;s another thing that doesn&#039;t get said enough:&nbsp; I love you.&nbsp; This is the most fun I&#039;ve ever had and I feel closer to the people I have met here than the vast majority of people I have to hide all of this from in real life.&nbsp; Stay light, have fun, and please please please take this on as more than a way to score drugs.&nbsp;

Or net 3.93% of order&#039;s value. Just under a 50% increase in commission charged.<br /><br />But the real dollar difference is only an increase in $25 going to DPR &amp; co. Can&#039;t say they don&#039;t deserve it because they do. <br /><br />So from the buyer&#039;s perspective:<br /><br />For a $2000 order... buyer paid $2000 before the change and if the vendor doesn&#039;t eat any part of the increase, the buyer will now pay $2025.<br />That&#039;s a $25 increase or 1.25% price increase. <br /><br />If a $25 increase in price on a $2000 order makes or breaks... I don&#039;t know what to tell ya. <br /><br />For orders under $500, the fees are virtually unchanged to slightly better than before.

It was just a $25 increase in fees over the old fee. <br /><br /><br />EDIT: Just saw Jack N Hoff&#039;s quoted post above. How did you come up with that number? The old fee on a $2500 listing is $38.5 + 1.5% amt over $1k. <br /><br />For a $2500 listing, that works out to $38.5 + ($1500 * .015 = $22.5) = $61 commission under the old schedule. Which amounted to 2.4% of the order&#039;s value.<br />Under the new schedule, it&#039;s probably the number you came up with (Didn&#039;t test it myself) which you say is $100.80. So that&#039;s a $39.80 increase. <br />On a $2500 order that amounts to 4.03% commission. A 70% increase in commission. But only a ~$40 increase. <br /><br />Granted, the commissions being charged are significantly higher than what Atlantis charges. But Atlantis doesn&#039;t have the customer base or the trust that SR has. <br /><br />

The idea in theory means they should* sell the coins immediately at the current market price so you don&#039;t gain or lose $$ value because of fluctuations in bitcoin prices and since they just sold your bit-coins at the $$ value of your order so they then have the money to give you after the customer finalizes. <br /><br />Of course what could now be happening is that SR (just like our banks) decides to speculate a bit and hold your coins a day longer for example selling when they feel the price is right and they can make a bit more profit. <br />In the recent market where BTC prices have only dropped that could leave them in the negative very fast as the margins they works with are quite small ( 4% - 10%, same as commission rates) so if things were to go wrong they could be in negative territory quite fast and that MAY be what we are seeing now. <br />It could be that SR is in a fractional reserve situation right now where they don&#039;t hold enough BTC to cover all pending orders that have yet to be finalized and need to raise fees to get back in the black butl ets hope that&#039;s not true as it would be VERY bad for sellers/buyers and SR itself.<br /><br />EDIT*<br />During the crazy bitcoin price turmoil a few months back I wrote from my old account in the bug reports section&nbsp; saying that the hedging feature is open to huge abuse in time of high fluctuation in BTC prices.<br />In a roundabout way I posted that potentially it could be used in an extreme example by BTC speculators to in fact hedge their own losses! <br /><br />Say for example price of BTC just drops just 10% in a few hours which has happened quite often. Since SR hedging is/was tied to the 24hour floating average price on MtGox I can still trade my BTC for weed on SR where my BTC is still worth 7 - 8% above the current MtGox price. Drugs are currency too and if people notice they can make an arbitrage by buying BTC on MtGox for $60 and it&#039;s worth $66 on SR then there are people who flaunt that opportunity every time it arises.&nbsp; <br />IMO, The hedging system was designed for a sub $30 bitcoin and the rise in price this year has exposed some of it&#039;s weaknesses. <br />As a seller here it also worries me a bit that there is the potential for SR to play speculator with everyone&#039;s bitcoins.

				@heatfireFlame - I&#039;ll have spore prints when the season starts, cause it&#039;s been requested before. But p cyanescens isn&#039;t something you can grow indoors. You have to cultivate them out doors in wood chip beds and only in areas where it gets cold enough in fautum, like 48F and below at night<br /><br />and it can take 2 years to develop a patch in a wood chip bed outside, not 1 month like cubensis<br /><br />That&#039;s the reason why people grow cubensis. If it was easier to grow cyanescens you would have seen cyanescens vendors long ago, because they&#039;re stronger than cubensis, but it&#039;s&nbsp; much harder and takes longer to grow<br /><br />
