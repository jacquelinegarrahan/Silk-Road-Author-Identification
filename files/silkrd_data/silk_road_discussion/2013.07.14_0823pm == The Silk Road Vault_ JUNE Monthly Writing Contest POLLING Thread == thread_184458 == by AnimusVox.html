				Hey AV<br /><br />Just wanted to say thanks for doing this, it&#039;s a great idea and I think if we persist with it, it will catch on. <br /><br />On that note, I have an epic trip report which I had hoped to submit the first time around but couldn&#039;t quite make it in time, even with the extension. It&#039;s almost done now..<br /><br />When do you plan to launch the next round? I&#039;ll be all over it.

				Apologies for such a late update, life sure has me all over the place!<br /><br />And it looks like KillerGlass is the winner of the first Silk Road Monthly Writing Contest! Congratulations, your trip report was fantastic! :D Please send me a message on Silk Road to the name AnimusVox so we can set you up with your prize. <br /><br />Thank you everyone that entered, I greatly appreciate your contributions! I will admit that I&#039;m a tad disappointed with the turnout of polling and commentary this go around, especially based on the initial interest that was sparked by the first thread. However, I&#039;m going to keep on keepin&#039; on. :) I really want this initiative to take off, and I&#039;m hoping it eventually snowballs into what I dream it to become. I urge you all to help me with this. I know for a fact there&#039;s a very creative side to the Silk Road as I see tons of trip reports spread across the forum, and everyone&nbsp; should be entering them! You took the time to write them up, so why not enter for a chance at some free drugs?! :D<br /><br />Much love.

				Great!<br /><br />I am a shroom guy myself, LSD on occasion but prefer natures own remedies.<br /><br />Got a great trip report which involves 20+ guys on shrooms camping out in the wild for a male bonding session.<br /><br />Turned out into a bit of a nightmare.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />But its always great after such trips.
