				i have spent a couple of bucks on the site and this is my first tracking no show. the post office shows it delivered but was never received. Than got a item the next day from another seller.&nbsp; The seller makes it very clear that once its out of the door its not his fault. would it be ok to leave lower feed back because i never got anything but state that he did have tracking or do i have to leave a 5/5 for a seller that did not get me a product.

				offcourse if you choose to give a low rating its you choice.<br />however a dissapearing package is strange unless it has been caught by customs.<br />in my case i would refund 50% when a package doesnt arrive <br />in your case i would do a 25% refund because the tracking said it arrived..<br />you should try to work it out with the vendor<br />SR wont gave you a refund because it arrived<br /><br />regards,mercury31

				If tracking says it was delivered, the vendor did their job..(usually)<br /><br />Maybe a family member caught it?

				Never leave a vendor a bad rating for something like that. They did exactly as expected and agreed to. Once it&#039;s in the postal system, it&#039;s no longer the responsibility of the vendor. The vendor has no control between the point it is transferred to the postal system and your address. <br /><br />Leave a 5/5 and you can use the comment system to say it never arrived even though tracking said it did. <br /><br />

Probably the most important part of this operation is the stealth of packages.

				make sure someone in your household did not get it.......I had a guy get super pissed....sent me 2 to 3 messages the he did not get his package on time.....it was suppose to arrive on a Saturday.<br /><br />this guy started sending me messages on a Sunday......after i logged on I saw the messages.....went and checked the DCN and it showed delivered......I send him a message.....and found out his wife had it. &gt;:(<br /><br />In my book.....if the package shows delivered....it was delivered.....could be a bad address or something like that.....which happens.....I cut and paste the address people give me......and had a package just the other day....show undeliverable.....guy put the wrong address.....if that is caught soon enough you and have the package re-directed.....via the web....if you have the tracking number.<br /><br />Clearly you can leave whatever you want.....does it make it right?.....probably not.<br /><br />good luck

				How do we know that the tracking number given is actually linked to your package? I&#039;ve been given two different tracking numbers for one order by one moron of a vendor - the first was about 2500 miles off the mark, the second wasn&#039;t even for my country.<br /><br />I never got that package. Just sayin&#039;, could be a bogus tracking number you were given.

				The key word here (besides tracking) is DORM!<br /><br />Assuming we&#039;re talking about the lime green Delivery Confirmation sticker for US Domestic mail, that package was delivered to the address listed. <br /><br />It should say so right on the USPS.com website. <br /><br />The letter carrier scans that barcode, right before depositing the letter/parcel in the receptacle at said address. <br /><br />It&#039;s seems obvious that someone in the DORM, who has access to the mail, intercepted your package. <br /><br />Is there any person you can think of that knows you order from SR, and would be on the lookout for your package? <br /><br />Have you told anyone on campus that you order shit from SR? - If so, you&#039;ve compromised your own delivery address. If tracking says it was delivered, there&#039;s not much you can do. It certainly has nothing to do with the vendor. The vendor had sense enough to use tracking-(Delivery Confirmation). <br /><br />At this point, it&#039;s case closed. <br /><br />Sounds to me like it was stolen by someone on your campus. Stealth was good enough to get it delivered. The Vendor&#039;s respnsibility ends when that barcode gets scannned at the final destination<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty black and white. There&#039;s a thief amongst your campus. <br /><br />What&#039;s the possibility that the campus police have it, and are just waiting for someone to come forward?<br /><br />Did you use your real name? Also how is mail addressed? Do you have a box that only you have a key to, or does someone have a job to deliver it from the delivery point to your dorm room? - These are the things I&#039;d be looking into. The vendor gets 5/5. IMHO, you should&#039;ve finalized already. <br /><br />Wrong address delivered to is always possible, but you&#039;ll have to take that up with the post office, and or the person who has access to mail for all tenants mail in your dorm. <br /><br />Hopefully someone &#039;held it&#039; for you because you weren&#039;t available when it arrived. Otherwise, it&#039;s gone, and you just have to eat the loss. <br /><br />I&#039;ve eaten my share of losses for various reasons. I&#039;d get a different &#039;ship to&#039; address if I were you. Good Luck, and sorry to hear about what you&#039;re going through. <br /><br />Chip<br /><br />PS. If it were a &quot;bogus&quot; tracking number, it would show a different address. I&#039;m assuming you&#039;ve already looked up the tracking number on USPS.com. It should show every checkpoint from post office of origin to the exact time it was delivered to the specific address. If it says that on the tracking page online. It&#039;s time to stop blaming the post office, and take a good long look at your &quot;friends&quot;. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				The key word is DORMS!!!<br /><br />It was 100% delivered...and in. No. Way. Shape. Or form. Is this vendors fault...<br /><br />You have to leave 5/5...and top of that it is pretty cool that you as a buyer...understand enough to write the messages you do and to ask the right questions.. and also you got all really good answers EXCEPT for the guy that talked about the vendor could be doing non stealth ...baggies ect... the fact is..IF a vendor was doing that..and I know some are fucking dumb enough....it would be noted in his feedback...and I would have to say he would be a NEW vendor...also that is why it is important to read the actual feedback and choose&nbsp; a newer vendor carefully...<br /><br />But if a vendor sends the package...and the DCN says delivered...100% of the time...the vendor did the correct thing and you should always leave a 5/5..and in no case do you deserve a refund...ESPECIALLY A DORM SITUATION!!!<br /><br />But it would be kosher if the vendor offered you a discount or something...assuming in&nbsp; a case like yours...you are not lying(you are 100% not)<br /><br />As many have said...the vendors ONLY job is sending it...and of course 99.999% if it says delivered it is...in this case it is obviously delivered in the dorm wrong or stolen...none of the vendors fault..and is just a chalk it up...as you have had a great&nbsp; run so far....<br /><br />@ Xbox123....why in the world do you wast your time in these forums...and not even waste the time..but put in your signature your SR &quot;stats&quot;...that is so stupid and totally pointless. I am sure some of you think it is &quot;cool&quot; and I am also sure 99% of the time it is a young guy...let me be the first to tell you...it is not cool and it is a stupid idea..<br /><br />Think about that...<br /><br />Edit 8:33pm: I can&#039;t believe another user said the exact same thing...but one thing he is a little off on ...the lime green tracking stickers have been obsolete for months..and some vendors, that do not go into post offices, still stick them on their packages in hopes that the post office scans it. And&nbsp; truth is some post offices still scan them...as these vendors drop off in a blue box... and after they are picked up the postman that deals with them will just scan as usual...because the software it still the&nbsp; same....BUT the reality is if you take it into a post office they will take it off or cross it out...and within a few months...they will not scan them at all as the&nbsp; new system will not allow it.. and all Priority mail has a built in DCN now for &quot;free&#039; because the USPS spent over a million a year on printing the green labels. <br /><br />So I would assume that this was not a green sticker...but either way it is USPS tracking...and that says delivered....and it was.<br /><br />But strange as fuck I used the same words as another member at the same time basically.. :o Obviously&nbsp; he is a brilliant guy and after reading his&nbsp; post it is CRYSTAL CLEAR he is MENSA. +1 for you Chip! I am a fan. 8)

				@RxKing - What can I say? - Good minds think alike. <br /><br />1st I heard about the Lime Green DCN stickers being done away with, <br /><br />I remember hearing something changed about DCN as of the 1st of the year. <br /><br />Come to think of it, the last few I had, were black+white, but I think those were express.<br /><br />I mailed something a month ago, and the PO near me still had those green ones!<br /><br />But if you saw/knew the town I&#039;m in, you&#039;d be surprised there&#039;s even an ATM within 20 miles!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Ever see the movie &#039;Funny Farm&#039; with Chevy Chase? - Like that.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Basically East Bumfuck, New England. - (frost warning tonight) LoL<br /><br />That&#039;s about as much as I&#039;m giving away. <br /><br />Also good point about listing your stats. - If any LE are keeping stats, or tracking anyone&#039;s movement on here, that kind of thing only serves to help them. <br /><br />Also never EVER access this forum from the .to site!!! - I wish there were a way to have a forum that was exclusively TOR accessible only!<br /><br />This forum is NOT secure. Silk Road is. This is NOT The Silk Road.&nbsp; - ( a little FYI for newbies)<br /><br />Also, change your forum name from time to time. - Throws LE off your scent. I&#039;ve been around here alot longer than this name. <br /><br />Also RxKing is a great vendor! <br /><br />Not only am I a member, I&#039;m also a customer!<br /><br />Take care<br /><br />Chip<br /><br />[edited to correct spelling error]

				I think someone stole your package too.<br /><br />I had the case with an amazon package, that the tracking said &quot;delivery failed&quot;, but the driver was simply too lazy to drive up my ally (it is a dead end) and so I din&#039;t even had a note in the mail. Call the company that delivered the package and find out who signed for it, if it was tracked there must be someone who signed it and that person is responsible. Campus police cannot intercept a package without a court order so that is highly unlikely. And if the police was involved they would let you get the package and bust you, as soon as you unpacked the drugs and didn&#039;t call the police yourself, because only then it is clear that YOU ordered them.<br /><br />Let you show you the signature (I have a lot of trouble with german DHL). I even had one case where the postman signed the package himself and left a bass-box worth $ 250 at my doorsteps. As I didn&#039;t want that to happen again, I called and they send me a print with the signature, so I could 100% say that this was not mine.<br /><br />I am sure in your country are strict laws that prevent ANYBODY from opening your mail without court order.<br /><br />Your vendor has done absolutely nothing wrong, so don&#039;t blame him for your &quot;bad luck&quot;.

				Nope. <br /><br />When a package is intercepted it doesn&#039;t make it out of a sorting facility. That is when it could be thought of as the vendor&#039;s fault. Like bad stealth or obviously faked return address. <br /><br />If it gets delivered to a physical address, it&#039;s USPS&#039;s fault or whatever intermediary is involved after delivered to the physical address. <br /><br />The vendor did his part. He gets 5/5.&nbsp; <br /><br />You pick a bad drop, that&#039;s on you, the buyer.

The address was confirmed by the seller and we both did our part. Does he believe me ,maybe.. scammers&nbsp; suck but this blows.&nbsp;
