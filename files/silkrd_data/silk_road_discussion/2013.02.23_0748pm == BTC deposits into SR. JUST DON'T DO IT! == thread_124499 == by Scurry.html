				With no support from any administrators with any information that is solid and can be relied upon, DO NOT DEPOSIT MONEY INTO THE SR UNTIL SOMEONE WITHIN THIS ORGAINIZATION CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF THOUSANDS OF MISSING DOLLARS BY CUSTOMERS HERE.<br /><br />THAT THERE IS SILENCE FROM WITHIN THE SR ADMINISTRATION REGARDING ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE FUNDS, IS WOEFULLY DISCONCERTING!<br /><br /><br />SOME ONE HAS TO SHOUT THIS!&nbsp; SO I WILL!

				As I understand it, there is no money actually missing -- there are deposits that haven&#039;t been credited to some users&#039; wallets, but those deposits are shown on blockchain, so therefore are not actually &quot;missing&quot; --- they just need to be pushed through manually.<br /><br />The other moderator and myself have sent several messages to DPR and the admins since yesterday morning, but have not yet heard back.&nbsp; Hopefully soon.<br /><br />In the meantime, it seems that some people are able to deposit and withdraw without issue, while others are having serious problems.

				Hey scout, thanks for dealing with all these like a *CHAMP* for the last few days.<br /><br />Just curious if you&#039;ve heard any reports back from any of the people facing this issue, how long is it generally taking to get a response from support?

				Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t heard anything back from anyone.&nbsp; I think I read a thread where one person&#039;s deposit finally came through, but it seems like most of the people that were having this problem are still having this problem.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a universal, site-wide issue, so it looks like it&#039;ll be something that has to be dealt with on an individual basis by the staff.

				Yeah, I hate to be the guy who&#039;s all, &quot;what problem?&quot;&nbsp; But, the biggest problem I&#039;ve had since the glitch was a transfer out to an instawallet that took about 16 hours.&nbsp; 3 successful orders in between.

				Scurry&#039;s right - with some of us seeing delays going on two days, why take the chance? Keep your BTC out of SR until things get cleared up (which I have no doubt they will, eventually).

				I did not have a problem depositing BTC to my buyer account, but when I try to withdraw from it it&#039;s having issues.<br /><br />It has been 24 hours since withdrawing and coins haven&#039;t showed and the transaction is not on blockchain either.<br /><br />Guess just gonna have to give it time. Thanks to Scout for being a cool mod...im sure it&#039;ll get figured out.

				Can you please consider deleting some of these threads and posts?<br />Things are working good now.&nbsp; No money was ever missing everything shows up finding the block chain, So it&#039;s easy for the administrators to clear everything up when they have time and make it through the queue of tech-support emails they must have.<br /><br />So it&#039;s not fair that you scare and fearmonger everyone else because your case is stuck further down in the queue of tech-support cases?&nbsp; &nbsp;Relax your case will come up and it will become resolved have some patients And wait your turn.<br /><br />If you days late isn&#039;t that bad compare that to the government waiting for your tax return and stuff like that?&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree that they should resolve cases faster, but you can imagine the hundreds of fake support emails they must have to sift through?&nbsp; People claiming to lost cash , and having to verify each email support case on the block chain ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Yikes.<br /><br />You can thank fellow road users for clogging up tech support for you with nonsense requests and repeat requests . <br /><br />You have nothing to fear ,&nbsp; the evidence is all there to see what went wrong so it&#039;s easy to fix.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you can come up with more cash in the meantime to make purchases.&nbsp; &nbsp;Besides, the longer you wait - the more your coins go up in value.&nbsp; You ll get back even more.<br /><br />Hahaha you had me scared to make a buy for three days now.&nbsp; I finally tested it an it works good for deposits . <br />Report to moderator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;127.0.0.1<br />---------------------------------------<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp;Graphic Design &amp; Web design&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />---------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----------
