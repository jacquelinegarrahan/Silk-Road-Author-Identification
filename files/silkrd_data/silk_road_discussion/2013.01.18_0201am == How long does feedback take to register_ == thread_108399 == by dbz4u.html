				I&#039;m sure this has been asked before but i can&#039;t find the thread. I just left a lovely review for the new vendor Nuggz, and I want it go live so everyone on the main site know how fantastic he was with his sample and communication.

				Also i believe this was a stealth listing and it would be a real shame if no one could see the feedback but him

				Feedback is instant...give or take a few minutes for the system to register it...never longer then a couple minutes.<br /><br />But stealth feedback does not go public obviously and is not seen except by the vendor.<br /><br />What you just did is seen by more people&nbsp; :D<br /><br />You can always leave a review in the rumor mill section.

BUT I have plenty of feedback for both and I have had buyers who respond like you. It is very nice you are doing/saying these things and that you left a great feedback for him. It would be great if you left a post in the Rumor Mill section or on his review thread. And if he does not have a review thread...then you should start one. Just title it &quot;Official review thread of XXXX&quot;.<br /><br />Nothing better on this forum then when a buyer is very happy with their experience buying on Silk Road.

He has zero feedback listed on the main site, and we know most of the noobs won&#039;t go beyond scrolling down. I left him a truly heartfelt review in the rumor mill, and honestly it would be more than a shame if it didn&#039;t show up on the main site. I know Nuggz would want it on there. He went above and beyond and half the people that are going to look at his profile won&#039;t know shit about how cool a guy he is. Fucked up

				It&#039;s funny but I&#039;ve been jumping around trying to figure out why those weren&#039;t showing up on my listings. Now I know!<br /><br />dbz4u man I don&#039;t know what to say. You are one hell of a reviewer. Talk about going above and beyond. People are going to start thinking I have you on my payroll.... BTW need a job? <br /><br />It&#039;s all good dbz4u. I have the review thread listed on my page now, and also in my sig. You gave a great review and people will see it. Next time I give samples you are automatically on my list. <br /><br />Peace

But no man, I&#039;m seriously impressed with the way you went above and beyond. Shipping weed(which STINKS compared to other drugs) to a guy for free over the internet in the possibly vain hope that the guy would write you even just a few king words is mind blowing. I&#039;d be a motherfucking piece of shit if I didn&#039;t write what i had wrote, believe that

				just wanted to pop in to capitalize on dbz&#039;s sentiments. he and I might not always agree on everything, but Nuggz is one of them and it&#039;s always a little dagger in my heart when people don&#039;t see my reviews for stealth listings, especially when it&#039;s for new vendors who really went above and beyond - just like Nuggz did. more people need to know, and I know the vast majority of SR users don&#039;t even bother with the forums. :(
