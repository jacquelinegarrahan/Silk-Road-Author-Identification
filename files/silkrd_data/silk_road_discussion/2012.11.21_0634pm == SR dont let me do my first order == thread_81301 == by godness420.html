				i would log of tor, then repair your actual network, log back onto to tor then go to http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/home&nbsp; if the site doesnt come up it means its busy just keep trying again and eventually you will get thru.....then enter your name password and passcode thing and you should get on... if not just keep reloading and you will get on

				let me see if i can find where you need to go if you forget your pin cause a lot of new people forget that they set up a pin when they started their account

				Somehow you are gonna have to find your pin or remember it because as far as i know there is no way to change it without knowing the original.... So you may have to start a new account and be sure to write down your pin or withdrawal i think that is what they call it when signing up

				yea they probably want you to log out and log back on because you messed up your pin two many times and they want to make sure that it is you and not somebody who has hacked onto your account

				and last thing if you truly do not know your pin i would put up another post like this one that says &quot;Is There Anything To Do if You Forget Your PIN&quot;&nbsp; or something along those lines because i am sure there as an admin that could either tell you how to make a new one or you might just have to start a new account idk&nbsp; <br />

				I&#039;m pretty sure you can reset your pin but it locks your account from orders for 7 days before it allows you to change it. I had this problem when I first registered also, but that was almost a year ago, I think the feature is still there.&nbsp; Unless you have an established account with good buyer stats it would be easier to create a new account than wait a week. That&#039;s your choice though. Hope this helps.

				Yea i just read a bunch of other people in a different discussion about how they messages the support team and it takes like 2 weeks for it to reset .... so like he said i would just start another account especially since you have no orders anyway
