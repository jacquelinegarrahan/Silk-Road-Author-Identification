				Arrested 3:15pm PST OCT 1. <br /><br />Weirdness with login most likely to caching or timing. Remember had multi server infrastructure that forwarded requests on. Possible when you login they put seizure notice up on webserver and front end login server still not down. They image server so have private keys for hidden service.

				7.29 am is 11.29 pm PST (assuming your clock is set to BST rather than GMT)&nbsp; We&#039;re 8 hrs ahead of SF, so depending on your clock he wasn&#039;t hanging out in the library when he was last talking to you.

				I found this on a news website.<br /><br />&quot;Federal authorities shut the site down and arrested Mr Ulbricht on Tuesday afternoon in a branch of San Francisco&#039;s public library.<br /><br />Mr Ulbricht was online on his personal laptop chatting with a cooperating witness about Silk Road when FBI agents from New York and San Francisco took him into custody, authorities said.&quot;

				yeah i read the said thing he was at a coffee shop nearby his boys house. i didnt want to originally believe it i thought it was all a hoax or fake, but it finally made the NY times and USA today as well as NBCNEWS, i mean im still hoping its all a hoax but some credible sources are documenting things about this an all the mods seemed to vanish as well but yeah i had the same issue it logged me on one time and shut the site down, oddly enough i was actually on the site with no issues minutes before this happened and the site wasnt shut down until almost a day after he was arrested

				Am I the only one who keeps Ctrl+F5 refreshing silkroadvb5piz3r.onion hoping the SR login page returns to normal?<br />Not comfortable using sheep or bmr, they seem very dodgy. But then who am I to judge what&#039;s dodgy since SR was supposedly compromised for so long? feeling a bit nauseous..
