				Go to account then to settings, make sure you are not on vacation mode. It automatically gets turned on if you don&#039;t log in for 3 days.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that. I turned off the vacation mode. I get the same error message every few times trying to get into my account as well. I believe even when your in vacation mode you can still post listings they just won&#039;t show up publicly.

				I was having a similar problem.&nbsp; I kept at it and eventually they posted.&nbsp; Try clicking the SR logo in the upper left of your screen from the error message page.&nbsp; When posting finally worked for me, clicking the logo took me to my listings page and my new listings were there.

				Yeap... Having the same issue. Not even able to upload a picture on my listing much less submit one. Also, I keep getting kicked off the site and referred to the 502 no server error message. It is becoming a pain lol

Seems odd that the site that was working properly before the attacks now has strange bugs that weren&#039;t there before. If it was only a DDOS attack nothing in the code should have been changed, no?

				The errors we&#039;re experiencing are DDOS mitigation because that is (one of the) attack vector(s)...<br /><br />That being said, I was just able to add a new listing and edit it several times.&nbsp; It gave me an error on creation but it was created. Even the image upload worked.&nbsp; Site still seems to be in and out.
