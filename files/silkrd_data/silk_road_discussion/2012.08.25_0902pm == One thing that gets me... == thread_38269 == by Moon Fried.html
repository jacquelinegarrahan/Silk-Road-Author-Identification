				When people leave reviews and can&#039;t stop themselves from saying things like &quot;buy with 100% confidence&quot; or &quot;the best/most trustworthy vendor on SR&quot;. Especially when it&#039;s orders of a small amount. It can be misleading at times. A vendor could just be fulfilling small orders, waiting to scam and act like it was not their fault on a bulk order.<br /><br />Hate to sound this paranoid, but it&#039;s just not a good idea to advertise that a vendor is the greatest just because you got what you ordered. Don&#039;t want newbs to trust the vendor from the feedback alone and go ahead and FE and never get a reply or product in the mail.

They&#039;ll think it&#039;s the norm... and it is the norm, actually. More new users FE than don&#039;t, and many probably don&#039;t go on these forums.
