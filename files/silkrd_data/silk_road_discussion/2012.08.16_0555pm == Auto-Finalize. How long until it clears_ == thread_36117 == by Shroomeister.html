				As a vendor I have just now encountered my first customer that has gone to auto-finalize. <br /><br />I watched the days tick by on his order. I know the order was received etc. <br /><br />When the order got down to the last 24 hours the timer turned to hours. 23 hours, 22 hours etc.<br /><br />Now it says &quot;processing&quot;. It has been in that status for almost 24 hours now. I guess I expected the payment to clear as soon as we got down to hour &quot;0&quot;.<br /><br />Im not dying for the funds to be released, I am just curious if anyone can tell me what the protocol is here.<br /><br />After a AF gets to the 0 hour - how long does it &quot;process&quot; for. If I was desperate for those funds, this would have totally screwed me.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				I guess you&#039;ll get your money any minute now. It shouldn&#039;t take more than 24 hours as they release it from sr support but sometimes they are busy overthere and a response may take a little bit more time. Don&#039;t worry ;-)<br /><br />*from my experience.

				I&#039;m not concerned about getting the funds. I just wanna know how long it usually takes. I deduce from what you are saying that the release of AF is a manual process handled by SR admins and not just something that happens automatically once the zero hour is reached. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for the input!

				Get used to it man, it happens all the time. I think some customers don&#039;t know that you&#039;re supposed to actually click the finalize button. I have one dude who has ordered from me 3 times now and has auto-finalized every time. Then he leaves and awesome review.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Should probably tell him something...<br /><br />Anyways I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s handled manually because sometimes it&#039;s processed very quickly and other times it takes the better part of a day.

				Yeah, I am already use to it and this is only the first time. I am surprised it took this longer before I got a AFer.<br /><br />Worth noting that the order in question has been past the 0 hour and in &quot;processing&quot; for over 24 hours at this point. Again Im not complaining, just putting the facts out there because like I said if I would have been counting on those funds being released to me @ the 0 hour, I would be screwed right now 24+ hours later.<br />

I am surprised that this is your first one. I have had a good 10 go into auto finalization. Prepare your self for the real fun ones, they will login when it gets down to 22hr or less and put it into resolution. Seems resolution extends the finalization clock by 4 days or until it is resolved. It is real fun when they do not enter anything into the resolution box and dont send you a message. Just leave it all blank and set the suggested resolution to 100% refund.&nbsp; :o

				Shroomeister, I&#039;ve also been waiting on an auto-finalize for a while. Normally they don&#039;t take this long. I think they&#039;re just busy trying to keep the site up right now. They&#039;ll get around to it&nbsp; :D

				Contacted Vendor Support about 6 hours ago and asked what is up with this issue. The first response was pretty much &quot;It&#039;s a recent problem that&#039;s being looked into.&quot;<br /><br />I replied and asked for a potential time frame. I got:<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m trying to get authorization to manually release until it gets fixed, hopefully within the next few hours.&quot;<br /><br />That was 4 hours ago.

				As a (relatively new) customer I still understand the process. The average customer is on the edge of their seat in anticipation for an order to arrive but should realize the same is true for funds to be released from escrow.&nbsp; I hope for vendors sake there is at least a rating mechanism for customers so you can make informed decisions on who pays accordingly.
