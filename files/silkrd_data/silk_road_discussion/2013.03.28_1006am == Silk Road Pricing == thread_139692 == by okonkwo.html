				When I bought bitcoins two weeks ago they were 1btc for 71 dollars.&nbsp; Now they are 1btc for 92 dollars but the prices for items on SR&nbsp; have not come down as much as the bit coins get more expensive.&nbsp; I am going to wait a few more weeks to see if bitcoins get past 100 and then who knows.&nbsp; I mean I really want some coke, x, H, and&nbsp; meth but right now I stand to make some money on my bitcoins.&nbsp;

				My understanding is that the SR bitcoin value is based on the Mt.Gox 24 hour average, which is why you see a higher per bitcoin value than what SR shows. I know what you mean though, it&#039;s hard to make a purchase knowing your Btc could be worth 30% more in a couple weeks... could also crash though!

				Roger that. Damn, I have to give it to those who are waiting patiently to buy their goodies based on possible BTC fluctuations. <br /><br />I buy my drugs as needed, when needed. BTC value be damned.

				Currently MT Gox has my bitcoins and won&#039;t release them until my account is verified so it might be 10 more days.&nbsp; That is what really frustrates me.&nbsp; I want to buy. I have learned about PGP, FE and auto finalize, hedge and unhedged.&nbsp; I am still scare of le but I want to make a purchase and stop being a lurker

				I watched the price on my tracked items drop day by day.&nbsp; &nbsp;I bought BTC at $47 each and spent them at $90.&nbsp; Felt good and wish I got more then.&nbsp; I was on my last .60btc or so and was short on my last purchase.&nbsp; I literally left my browser open and hit the refresh button every hour or so watching the price drop.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I can confirm it does change.&nbsp; Look at MtGox weighted average.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also read about MtGox wanting verification for moving larger amounts.&nbsp; What happens if you try moving several smaller transactions over a few days?

				Something like that here, bought coins at 67, then rise to 90, buy a couple things, then keep it up, but well, u have to purchase once for all, i mean, if the price rise by SOMMETHING, u made a nice invest, u know what i mean? stop going around cuz i at least, think that the price will do an epic fall, so its better to go away while u&#039;r winning.
