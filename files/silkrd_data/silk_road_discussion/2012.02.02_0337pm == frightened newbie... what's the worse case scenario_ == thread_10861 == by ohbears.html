				this may seem laughable to those who have done this many times. I am just nervous and paranoid. I want to order weed and some psychedelics but I&#039;m scared to pull the trigger because of the unknown. Are there ANY horror stories? What is the worst that could happen?<br /><br />It seems very unlikely that police would show up at my door for a few grabs of herb. It would have to be an actual stakeout?! I imagine that the real risk is getting cheated or having a package confiscated during transit. There are probably lots of threads with these concerns, but given SR&#039;s growth, it seems people aren&#039;t all that afraid to be a part of the system.<br /><br />If it DOES work and there isn&#039;t real risk, this is a whole new, beautiful world.

				You become someone&#039;s jailhouse bitch. Anal rape. Nothing too severe. LOL. Just kidding. I buy only weed and have had 6 or 7 successful deliveries so far without any trouble. It&#039;s good to be cautious but paranoid? Not so much. Study the threads on the forums, especially in Security, know the laws for possession for your state&nbsp; - hopefully just a fine up to a certain amount - and don&#039;t order more than that.

				I&#039;m pretty new here with 10 transactions but my paranoia has pretty much subsided. Some things you can do to minimize the risk:<br /><br />Read the forums. There is a lot of useful information here regarding security.<br />Make sure to research your vendor on the forums before placing an order. Feedback will only tell you so much.<br />Don&#039;t finalize early for any reason, even from a trusted vendor. This is the only thing that protects a buyer from being scammed.<br />Ordering domestic means no customs risk and faster shipping times.<br />Don&#039;t use a fake name.<br />Always use GPG when sending your address.<br />Do not sign for any packages.

If the package gets delivered regardless, isn&#039;t it less of a risk to not have your name attached?

				If you&#039;ve used a fake name for a long amount of time, buying legal things with it, then maybe you could use that name, I would be still be very apprehensive about doing this.<br /><br />If you suddenly start using a fake name out of nowhere then a postman worth his salt is going to get suspicious.

				Worst case scenario: Swat raids your house, shoots your dogs, destroys everything in the search for drugs. You then spend 2 years in prison. Is this going to happen? Most likely no. There are risks when having drugs shipped to you house, but use a reputable vendor and you greatly minimize these risks. I stressed like crazy my first buy but everything worked out.

				Buy small amounts until you get comfortable. Hell, even when you are comfortable only buy small. Check out your local marijuana laws and penalties ( http://norml.org/states ) and use that as a basis on how much you should order. Personal use amounts are not going to end up coming in a controlled delivery. Worst case scenario they&#039;ll just be confiscated. To reiterate what everyone else has said; Use PGP when sending your address, use your real name, do you research on vendors, and all should go well. Good luck. <br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />-DP

				regarding fake name, I think the general consensus is this: <br /><br />fake name = increased probability of unwanted attention vs increased plausible deniability. <br /><br />When you weigh the two against each other, its the unwanted attention which you want to avoid.<br /><br />plausibly deniabilty is cheap, but avoiding unwanted attention, well, that is priceless.<br /><br />moral to story? use real name.

				Yea, as long as the amount is kept small, the risk is kept small; so just don&#039;t start dealing and you shouldn&#039;t have anything to worry about.

Think before you assume. I&#039;m sure you get spam letters occasionally, did you ask for them? No, do they have your name and address? Yes. Using a real name has no causation linked to it.
