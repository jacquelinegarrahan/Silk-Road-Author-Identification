				So ive just noticed the change in cancellation policy. <br /><br />It was 4 days in &#039;processing&#039;, before a buyer had the option to cancel the order. It is now 7 days.<br /><br />I personally dont feel that 7 days is fair, from the buyers aspect. 4 Days was a more than reasonable amount of time for a vendor to ship an order. If it where the case that the particular vendor, or vending team was simply to over whelmed with orders, than it would only seem right to go stealth for X amount of time. <br /><br />Just my thoughts, trying to gauge others opinion on this. Much love every one.

				I hope the 7 day timeframe isn&#039;t permanent :/ I personally think 4 days was already stretching it a bit, but if this extension is permanent, vendors will have more power than necessary. As others have said, it&#039;s likely the 7 days thing is because SR was down for so long.

				I hope it&#039;s not permanent. But if it is then just have to deal with vendors with johnny on the spot shipping. <br /><br />But I never had to cancel an order yet. The cancel link has never gone live for me so I guess it doesn&#039;t matter.

				4 days was fair. 7&#039;s all good though. i mean if you REALLY needed to cancel an order you could just message the vendor and ask them to cancel it.

				Seven days is a long time.&nbsp; Particularly if a vendor says on their page that they &#039;guarantee shipping within 48 hours&#039;&nbsp; and then they don&#039;t.&nbsp; I have an order I placed on Wednesday that is still &#039;processing&#039; and I have no way to cancel it for another 3 days.&nbsp; If I&#039;d known it would have taken this long to get it I would have ordered elsewhere.&nbsp; I am getting no response from the vendor either, I&#039;ve messaged them twice.<br /><br />Worst thing about it is you have all that coin tied up in an order you&#039;re not sure you&#039;re ever going to receive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m a patient guy but I&#039;d still like the option of canceling my order if it hasn&#039;t shipped inside of 4 days.

				With the volatility of the bitcoin market at the moment, I think 7 days is way too long for customers to be able to cancel their orders. <br /><br />IMHO, 4 days is more than adequate for a vendor to get an order packed and shipped. If they can&#039;t handle that work load, they need to take down their listings so they can get on top of their game again :)

				3 days is ideal.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;BMR doesnt appear to have a time limit, which really sucks when you&#039;ve been waiting 5 days, and the vendor was last seen 3 days ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />It&#039;s grinding my gears real good right now.<br /><br />

				7 days is ridiculous.<br /><br />It would probably only be acceptable for the bigtime vendors who process hundreds of orders per week, but these vendors are in the minority anyway, so the 7 day timeframe will just promote laziness/slow dispatch amongst others.

				I think 7 days is too long. It would be pretty annoying to order, expecting it to be posted next day then the vendor takes their time and ships it almost a week later.
