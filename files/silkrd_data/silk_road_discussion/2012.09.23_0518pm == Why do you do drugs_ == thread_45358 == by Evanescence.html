				I&#039;m bit past the party stage in my life so I&#039;ve got two reasons:<br /><br />1) Self-medicating for anxiety / depression<br /><br />2) Self development.&nbsp; Psychedelics have the power to make your mind more malleable and expandable.&nbsp; You grow as a human being and also a being itself.

				I do different drugs for different reasons:<br /><br />1. Weed- To relax and sit back<br />2. Drink- to party and have fun and not give a fuck<br />3. Psychedelics- To expand my mind and have spiritual experiences<br />4. Mdma- To dance and to not worry about anything, and to be incredibly social<br />5. Coke- Partly to be social, partly to have a lot of fun, and partly to assist in my own demise<br /><br />

				well a mix of all of the above, depends what sort of mood im in, if i want to party mdma, coke and weed, if i want to escape my life for a short while K or lots of strong weed. if i want to have an spiritual encounter acid strooms or dmt. to be honest the main reason i take drugs is cos they are fun and because they say i can&#039;t, feels like a life time ago but when i was underage all i wanted to do was stay up late and drink but ever since i could do these things they quickly become boring and now they say i cant do drugs i want to all the more.&nbsp; but fun is the main factor for me.

				Look a-fuckin-round.<br /><br />Life is largely boring and depressing (really depends on your outlook I guess) but most importantly: objectively meaningless.<br /><br />We all die anyway. Life is about quality, not quantity.<br /><br />Nobody in their right mind would want to live forever, you&#039;d get incredibly bored and go insane.<br /><br />This is why I do drugs.<br /><br />They do not detract from my life at all, they enhance it.<br /><br />WE ALL DIE IN THE END SO MAKE THE FUCKING MOST OF IT (who votes for this to become SR&#039;s new motto?)<br /><br /><br /><br />of course... there is that alternative drug that most people are addicted to on this planet: RELIGION.... the opiate of the masses. So either you can take that drug and hope that when you die you&#039;ll go to heaven (and basically be in a drug-like high for the rest of eternity), or you can take your chances, experience drugs here on earth and when you die and nothing happens, at least you had a fucking great time here and enjoyed yourself.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br />And to all those people that say &quot;I get high on life, I don&#039;t need drugs&quot;.. good for you! I get high on life too... I get even higher on life when I take MDMA at a club and make love to beautiful women and gain confidence and social skills that I previously didn&#039;t have.<br /><br />Remember, drugs aren&#039;t always bad for you, there are certain scenarios you can take them which can change your life for the better, but you have to be smart about when you take them and not just get addicted and chase them everyday. This is the part most people struggle with, but like I said: WE ALL FUCKIN DIE ANYWAY SO WHATS THE FUCKING DIFFERENCE. THE REAL QUESTION SHOULD BE: WHY DONT YOU TAKE DRUGS?

				Because I&#039;m curious by nature, and some things demand that I try them at least once, so I don&#039;t go the rest of my life wondering.<br /><br />After the first time it&#039;s usually A or C that gets me back.

				A) because life is a party. I party every day all day, why you ask, because fun is the best part of life. <br />I guess drugs also make me like people more. I am a very social person, but I dislike most people. Drugs change that

				I do drugs all recreationally.&nbsp; I used to be addicted to opiates but I was able to beat that and no longer touch them.<br /><br />MDMA - do for fun and partying<br />Mushrooms - do for fun and I suppose philosophical reasons.&nbsp; I love the way I think on it.<br />LSD - do for music festivals and nature-related activities<br />Xanax - mostly for going to sleep after I do drugs =P<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely looking to try peyote, 2CB, DMT, etc.

				I can take it or leave it to be honest. I do not have an addictive personality and rarely feel the need to overdo anything. <br /><br />There are more important things than drugs. They are a nice side on the tasting plate of life.
