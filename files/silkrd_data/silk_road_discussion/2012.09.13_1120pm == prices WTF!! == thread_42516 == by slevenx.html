				There are obvious advantages to not doing that on the street, and you pay for them.

				like i said i am new here and have not used the service and plan to.<br />as for &quot;obvious advantages&quot; what would they be other than user reviews?<br />is it the higher quality ?<br />not trying to be obnoxious or anything,I&#039;m really looking forward to trying some things not available where i live. DMT for example.<br />wait there is another &quot;obvious advantage&quot;&nbsp; :P

				I&#039;m also new, but what I&#039;ve gathered so far:<br /><br />you can generally find whatever you are looking for. <br />you don&#039;t need to go out on the street.<br />check reviews, you don&#039;t have to deal with shady characters on the street.<br />Escrow.<br />Some prices here are better than what I get locally, so i guess it all depends on where you are. if you can get kpins for .75 at home then do that!<br /><br />Good luck

				What I&#039;ve found generally:<br /><br />Prescription prices on SR are higher. This is because prescription drugs sold on the streets are generally coming from someone who has insurance and pays next to nothing, so any money is profit. This isn&#039;t the case for people making a business out of it.<br /><br />Prices for illicit drugs are equal or cheaper here than on the street. If they&#039;re not cheaper, then the product is better.

				This is the darknet... so you can&#039;t really trust anyone, but there have been reports of controlled deliveries.<br /><br />Apparently it only happens when the person is buying large amounts though. They want the big players, not the little guys.<br /><br />Just stick with domestic at first, and if you&#039;re going to buy international get from a very trusted vendor who has good reviews on their packaging. The only international vendor I ever ordered from was SKYY just because his stealth method was absurdly good. 0% chance that anyone would find what&#039;s inside.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to buy domestic, then stealth isn&#039;t that big of a deal, but still just make sure the vendor knows what they&#039;re doing.<br /><br />Unless it&#039;s a REALLY good deal that you just can&#039;t pass up, go with the more trusted vendor even if it&#039;s a little more expensive.<br /><br />If I&#039;m going to buy something then I&#039;m probably going to go with only vendors who have 300+ transactions, even if their prices are double that of the new guys. It&#039;s just not worth the paranoia.

I know I&#039;m certainly paying more (much more) for weed than my West Coast counterparts, but that&#039;s just my fault for not living in the right states :-)
