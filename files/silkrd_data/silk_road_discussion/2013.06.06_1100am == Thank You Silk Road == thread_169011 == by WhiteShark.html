				So...<br /><br />I am basically going to keep this short and sweet, its just a thank you for everyone out there who gave me a chance, who didn&#039;t scam me, threaten me, or abuse the system in any way. My mission when I started this was to raise enough money to send my kids to good Universities without having them leave with tens of thousands of dollars of debt. With your help, in 6 months, I am a quarter of the way there. <br /><br />From the fabulous reviews, comments, and shared experiences, it has just been so amazing and uplifting to communicate with you all. The work of the mods: scout, SSBD, libertas (and if I am missing any sorry!), have helped me increase my stealth and increase my business. I am a very busy person, so efficiency is key for me. I have to manage my life, along with this, so thanks to everyone for always being patient. <br /><br />Unfortunately there have been some downs, as with everything. Firstly the investment scammer who many people sent there bitcoins too. Then there was the ddos attacks that made me ponder if that camel would be seen on that computer screen again. And of course those scammers who threaten to leave 1/5 unless you give them this and that. But, unfortunately, such things are inevitable. I am just glad to have fought through, and be here today.<br /><br />So anyways, as a final word, thank you, thank you all so much. For the support, for taking the chance to try me out, and for always always supporting me. With business picking up I expect to hit my goal within the next 12 months which is amazing. After that I will most likely close up shop, but who knows. I may keep running in stealth for some long term customers! Thank you for helping me to achieve this milestone. Half a year on the road, and a quarter of the way completed. <br /><br />Thank you Silk Road<br />Thank you Buyers<br />Thank you Vendors<br />Thank you World <br /><br />=) <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; White Shark

				I wish you well in your mission. But please don&#039;t confuse things, whether you&#039;re spending the ill gotten gains on your kids education. Or you&#039;re spending it on your self, it&#039;s still highly illegal. I don&#039;t think the sentence will be reduced because of the way the funds are distributed. Be careful, I wish you all the luck in the world. 8)

				I fully support -- well, the vast majority of DPR&#039;s public positions, not just drug legalization -- and don&#039;t mean to rain on your parade... but I hope you&#039;re taking into account the projected cost of attendance when your kids come of age, and not the current one.<br /><br />The financial sector of the education system in the U.S. is on the verge of collapse with something like 40% of those who receive student loans ending up defaulting on them because they don&#039;t make enough to pay the fucking things back (that&#039;s just off the top of my head, it may be much lower)... so who knows what&#039;ll happen in the future.&nbsp; Just... ya know... wanna make sure you&#039;re being realistic and all about the total amount required.<br /><br />Best of luck with it either way :)

				I don&#039;t have enough addresses to burn to be comfortable buying international, but I wish you the best of luck. You&#039;ve got serious balls and I&#039;m kind of proud of you. If my mom did some shit like this and I found out later in life it would be sooooo fucking cool. I&#039;m sure everyone would be happy to have you stick around longer but actually pulling out on your own terms is some bad ass shit. It&#039;s not easy to resist the greed. Maybe just enough extra for a few extra vacations ;] Also I think you&#039;re the one with the bangin newbie thread, good on ya.
