				I used to use BitInstant all the time (bank deposit), but at some point they dropped all that and only take coupons now, which are totally worthless to me.&nbsp; Then I used the Virwox method when I was lazy and just wanted to use my card, but they&#039;re having problems now as well.<br /><br />What are you guys using to get BTC quickly and without risk?&nbsp; (e.g., I&#039;d rather not buy from a single user on SR, etc, as I have heard so many terrible horror stories about getting ripped off by even the most honest-seeming vendors).

				i still use bit instant, i just use their cash deposit option, through moneygram, use all fake info on the form, then make sure i wash my coins thouroughly through 4 seperate wash accounts before depositing them to SR. seems safe to me, i also run proxy servers to make sure even the IP isn&#039;t traceable. even though bitinstant is working with the feds or whatever if you use fake info and fake IP address they cant do shit anyway. if this is unsafe i guess i suck lol.

				Ha, looks like it&#039;s a temporary issue.&nbsp; They turned off cash deposits until Dec 7th.&nbsp; Nevermind.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://blog.bitinstant.com/blog/2012/12/6/cash-deposits-offline-until-tomorrow-dec-7.html

				If there is a branch of Bank of America convenient to you, I highly recommend Blue Sky Traders.&nbsp; Very nice and professional people. And no risk whatsoever to you. Their website:<br /><br />http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br />
