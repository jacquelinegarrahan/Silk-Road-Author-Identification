				Reason with the vendor. Be cool and he&#039;ll/she&#039;ll/they&#039;ll probably give you a discount on shipping. <br /><br />Remember, this is the drug trade. Things can and do happen.

				I&#039;d say talk with the vendor a bit more.&nbsp; Be extremely simple and just request free express on your next order (if you are ordering again in the future).&nbsp; Usually vendors will always compromise for another guarenteed order... I would probably message support or someone a bit higher up though before you go ahead and give up.&nbsp; If the situation is how you describe it, then you have rock solid evidence and reason to be giving a bad feedback.<br /><br />Seems that vendors abuse their power and that if you even receive the product you MUST give a 5/5... It&#039;s pretty flawed if you ask me... Btw if you do give up and leave a 5/5 just leave a shit review in the text and on his forum page. People will mind it

				I&#039;ve yet to notice a difference in the amount of time it takes to get the order in the mail between express and regular shipping. All you&#039;re paying for is faster shipping once it goes in the mailbox. Very few vendors get parcels out promptly, ymmv though.

				The rules are the rules. If the order is placed in transit by the vendor, it must mean that they dropped it in the mail. If not, said vendor can get his privileges revoked. So no, it is not right that you have to give a vendor anything close to a 5/5 unless they can prove that it was dropped in the mail the day it was marked in transit. If a vendor describes a packages shipping as express or priority or snail mail, it must reflect that in the receipt of the package. That is, unless there is a problem that occurred when in transit. A vendor cannot tell you to do anything you do not want to do and if they are instructing you to do so, I would report that vendor. It is against the rules. Also, a vendor cannot blackball you or whatever. Even if he/she does there will be 100&#039;s of other vendors you can choose from. That would be the vendors loss. Not yours. <br /><br />My advice would be to tread delicately on the situation. You have rights and if you read through the sellers rules you will be able to decipher whether a vendor is breaking the rules or not when they are dealing with you.<br /><br />Good luck with everything.
