				Greetings!<br /><br />Well, after lurking for a bit, and learning the ropes, I can finally post to say whats up.<br />I mainly wanted to go ahead and post here just in case the few people i contact off <br />the market wonder whom I might be.<br /><br />So far, it has taken me about a month to find silk road, the hidden wiki, and to figure<br />out how to set up encryption so I may contact a few people without worry of getting<br />a knock on my door some time in the future.<br /><br /><br />Anyways, thank you and glad to find such a amazing place with many like minded people.<br /><br />-Mindmechanic<br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s nice to see this post because i feel like a new comer. I haven&#039;t had the balls to order anything yet though. I figured i would get to know everyone on the site first. Get a feel for the place. I was recommended by a friend i trust very well. <br /><br />I guess I don&#039;t have the courage my friend has, yet. :)<br /><br />I also help to give something back to this community, the people seem really nice. :)

				.....<br />Yea, so I am Mindmechanic.<br /><br />Last night, I was pretty drunk, and no for the life of me I can not remember my god damn password(and I didn&#039;t attach email sooooo...)<br /><br />Anyways, i&#039;ll be using this one for now...<br /><br />lol, Anyways<br />I am pretty paranoid myself, but after reading alot of the shipping stuff in the forums and what not, I realize I should not fret or worry as I won&#039;t be ordering any real large amounts of anything.<br />The only worry I have, is giving me information out for shipping purposes. But I guess that&#039;s why I need to lurk abit more, and find out the legit and worth wile sellers.<br />I was hoping to do my first purchase yesterday but, now I think I might wait a bit longer.<br />I still have to figure out how to deposit bitcoins and what not.<br />I finally figured out how to encrypt my emails last night, and have sent one message out but have got nothing back in return.<br />I am honestly not sure if I am doing right, and need to spend the rest of the day practicing with Adele to ensure I am doing it correct.<br /><br />I was getting error messages from her at first saying something about my information wasn&#039;t complete, so...<br />Maybe now that I am sober I can figure it out.<br /><br />Anyways, sorry for the trouble.<br /><br />-Gram aka mindmechanic...<br /><br />

				Welcome to the forums guys, the best place to find the real infomation you need to know about your vendors.<br />Always use the search feature to find threads about vendors or topics or Pm any of the mods about questions you might have. :D

				Welcome<br />Stay paranoid.<br />You should not Tor or order from&nbsp; Silk Road while drunk.<br /><br />You might make a mistake if you&#039;re not 100%. Do be careful.<br /><br /><br /><br />
