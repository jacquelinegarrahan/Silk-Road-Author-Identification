				its not down for good, if it continues for a period of time its probably one of the DOS attacks it was the same problem loading page for almost a week when that happened, im sure shortly DPR will put a message out or a MOD will step in and post a thread for us to go to, just be patient

				Looks like this a pretty universal problem. I&#039;m experiencing the same dramas. Hopefully should be back online when I wake up in the morning. If not then it looks like we&#039;re going through the DDOS attacks again. Usually the SR admin staff while put a notice up when they&#039;re updating the site and I don&#039;t seen any notification at all I just get the same timeout error one would get when they attempt to visit an offline URL. <br /><br />Fingers crossed guys.

				WOW, you guys most all be newbies? If you joined the site a year ago you would know that getting the time out screen was more common then getting the login screen. THE SERVERS ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT BUSTED AS THEN IT WOULD SAY THEY URL DOES NOT EXISIST AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IT IS SAYING KNOW, TO TRY AGAIN LATER!&nbsp; There could be an increase of traffic, the need feedback system causing glitches ETC. AND for all those flippin out saying why hasn&#039;t DPR posted? HE IS HUMAN, HAVE YOU HEARD OF SLEEP? It might be friggin 4 in the morning where ever he&#039;s at and he doesn&#039;t even know theres issues yet!<br /><br />To all the customers freaking out, have you noticed it is the VENDORS telling you to stay calm and everything is going to be fine? All of you are freaking out because you can&#039;t place orders, well, I have enough money in escrow right now that if I lost it I&#039;d be totally fucked and I am NOT tripping about this. IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES, IT WILL BE FIXED BUT IT WILL ALWAYS SOMETIMES HAPPEN, EVEN REGULAR CLEARNET WEBSITES GET THE SAME ERRORS, IMAGINE HOW HARD RUNNING THIS SITE IS?

				This may be a botnet at work. The amount of Tor clients has doubled since August 19. It seems to affect other hidden services as well, not just Silk Road.<br /><br />http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/08/tor-usage-doubles-in-under-a-week-and-no-one-knows-why/
