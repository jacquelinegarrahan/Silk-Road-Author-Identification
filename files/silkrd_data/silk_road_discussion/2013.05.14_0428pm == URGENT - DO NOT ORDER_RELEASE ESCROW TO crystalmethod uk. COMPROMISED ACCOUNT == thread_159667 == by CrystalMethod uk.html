It is nothing to worry about - Silk Road is completely secure; it is user error that is causing all of these issues.<br /><br />Silk Road will NEVER ask you for your PIN, and any changes to the site URL will be stated and signed by DPR with his public PGP key, which should be saved by everyone from the link below:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Trust_and_phishing<br /><br />Libertas

				+1 to crystalmethod, I&#039;ve ordered from this bloke in the past, NoAddedSugar isn&#039;t my SR username by the way. He&#039;s a legit vendor, I have faith in him.
