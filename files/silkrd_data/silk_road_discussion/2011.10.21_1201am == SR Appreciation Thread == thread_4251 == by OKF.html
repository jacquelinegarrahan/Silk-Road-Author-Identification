				I just have to get this off my chest, because i was worried when the site went down:<br /><br />Thank you Silk Road, thank you for excisting.<br /><br />This site means more to me than buying drugs. I&#039;m not much of a drughead, i take some speed once or twice a week, i like experimenting with lsd or shrooms. I&#039;m gonna try some more stuff in the future, but for now, that&#039;s basically it. For me, this site isn&#039;t about drugs alone.<br /><br />It&#039;s about freedom, the freedom of choice. I want to decide what&#039;s good for me and what&#039;s not and do what the fuck i want [as long as i don&#039;t harm anyone]. Society and the government do what&#039;s best for the dumb mass, not for the individual. Because of the possible failure of a few, everybody else has to suffer. <br /><br />I&#039;m annoyed to death by this kind of treatment. If someone can&#039;t handle drugs, he shouldn&#039;t have taken them in the first place. It&#039;s not like anyone (at least in western society) doesn&#039;t know the risks. The prevention of a bad decision by another instance doesn&#039;t change anything, as long as the person doesn&#039;t know why. Let people experience, let them try, let them make their own mistakes, let them fail.<br />It&#039;s the only thing they learn from.<br /><br />The Silk Road gives me the rare possibility of free choice, beyond the limitations of a regulating society.<br /><br />That&#039;s why i love it and that&#039;s why it means more to me.

Said what I wanted to say for a while now. I could at a little bit more to it about who is really profiting from keeping drugs illegal: eg, privately run prison systems, law enforcement, pharmaceutical companies, the gov&#039;t who is owned by all of above.. but if its an appreciation thread, I&#039;ll join in and just say thank you to SR for shining the light of freedom on our dear human souls.

				Its amazing to me that there are only like 13 or 14 members that posted in this thread, and no they&#039;re riight at the point to where they&#039;re getting the servers ready and have backup servers ready, its about to be back up anytime/day now and still only 13-14 people had the capacity to wade through the shit and say, &quot;We love you SR, and we know that you&#039;re here to help us. We know you will do, and have done, everything in your power to help us and we are here to support you as the only way we can help is with our kind thoughts and kind words.&quot; I&#039;m beginning to believe that out of the folks that come here, the ones of us that truly appreciate this place for what it is are, in fact the minority of users. Its sad really that nobody could stop to smell the roses through this whole outage. Those who couldn&#039;t are the idiots Joe Rogan talks about in his bit about all the smart people dieing and nothing but dumbasses being left; how many of you are going to die just waiting for the lights to come back on???<br /><br />I mean gawddamn! I saw sooo much negative energy being sent towards the very people who have given us the extra layer of freedom to wade against the cold injustice of the modern, 1984, society rest we are now living in, its enough to make you sick. We are the resistance. We are here as a sign post to the world saying, WE ARE FREE TO DO WHAT WE WANT WITH OUR OWN BODIES. And we aren&#039;t hurting anyone, infact I bet some SR users, like myself, might have had drug problems in they&#039;re past(yeah its an assumption, but a safe one, and I don&#039;t feel like an ass yet. U?) Just think if we had found a place like this when we were younger, maybe we wouldn&#039;t have ever had a drug problem, had the drugs been presented to us as they are now.(a bigger assumption that is wrong because it couldn&#039;t have happened, hence it didn&#039;t, but good for dramatic affect) If we had a SR in every city, how much would the crime rates plummet? If we gave people true freedom, wouldn&#039;t the wheat surely separate itself from the chaff?<br /><br />Senators want to shut us down, but can&#039;t. They fear us and what we stand for. They don&#039;t want to lose the money the have tied up investing in a failing penal system. They see that the end IS nye(hehe that&#039;s me), but their own end not ours. So cower, politicians. Hide behind your crumbling towers and your war-hungry gods, but they are both already on our side. That&#039;s why they&#039;ve turned their backs to you, not so you can hide, but because they want you to forever live in the darkness you created, the very same darkness that you are so frightened of, the darkness of the unknown, the darkness of truth that is &quot;for every action, or lack thereof, there is a consequence&quot;<br /><br />We&#039;re here to stay people! And this is coming from a post-gawker!

				If you&#039;ve ever had a successful transaction on SR, you&#039;ve experienced something truly revolutionary!&nbsp; May all the power be with SR during this recovery.&nbsp; As with any revolution, it doesn&#039;t come without some pain.&nbsp; <br /><br />This downtime should make us all thankful someone like SR came along to let the genie out of the bottle.&nbsp; And now he&#039;s out, even if SR goes away, which will not happen, you can count on this private, anonymous marketplace idea to surface again, and again.&nbsp; It&#039;s inevitable.&nbsp; In the scheme of things, it&#039;s existence is a positive for the world.&nbsp; It makes my Libertarian heart beat with determined happiness.<br /><br />Hang in there SR.&nbsp; We&#039;re with you.

				Just wanted to throw in my .02BTC and say big thanks to SR. I&#039;ve had several successful transactions here, in and out of escrow, and I think that the system we have here is THE BEST in existence for doing what we do.<br /><br />Keep up the good work.

				Hear, Hear,<br /><br />Most gracious Kudoos to Silk Road. Since Mrnye666 is call us out on this. Silk Road is a pioneer in personal choice and and individual liberty. You have my greatest respect and highest regards. I am missing the Silk Road just like everybody else. You do not realize what you have till it is gone. This has been the greatest idea since the Internet it&#039;s self. This is the Virtual Land of the Free and Home of the Brave. May the blessing of health and well being shine down on you like the true pioneer that you have demonstrated yourself and ideas to be.<br /><br /><br />Slide&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				Thanks Silk, hope you get it straightened out. This is a multifaceted thing, yes it had been going on for years, but as was mentioned the &quot;cat is out of the bag&quot;. I am sure many of us have explored other possibilities via the deep web because of this outage. I am waiting on sr and trying to get in touch with a vendor through the forums. You can bet in future dealings I will ask my herb and molly friends for an alternate method of contact. I do appreciate the hell out of sr and the idea it represents. It sounds corny but it has helped slap the shit out of me and get me back on the path. TYVM

				Just because people haven&#039;t posted on this thread, doesn&#039;t mean they haven&#039;t been grateful to SR, or expressed appreciation. I myself have had to try about 50 times today to even get to the Forum, and that&#039;s hitting refresh about 50 times once I&#039;m on. I also have nothing better to do with myself, so I&#039;m assuming people with real jobs and other people around, can&#039;t be sitting around obsessing and waiting for the Forum to go back up so they can come here to fulfill a post request about gratitude. <br /><br />The fact that many of the more versed people here continue to keep their business here, taking part in the escrow transaction, and paying commission to SR, keeps the doors open. There are many other choices on the Tor network, but many of us show our support to SR by staying here, despite the server crashes, and the like.<br /><br />That being said, if none of the above is proof enough to SR, which I&#039;m sure he and his team are well aware, I for one, am grateful. Big ups.
