				Man, I never realized how honest and kind many of the people on the Silk Road are-- besides the few bad apples, of course--until very recently.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure a few of you know, but for those you don&#039;t, my partner and I took a crippling blow (I guess it was like 2 weeks ago now?) whenever we were robbed going to pick up for our last batch of orders.<br /><br />I was forced to cancel all of my pending orders, including one that had gotten mixed up in packaging and he was being reimbursed (the guy that got his was stoked though lol).&nbsp; Of all the people in my life, the strangers on Silk Road offered to help much more than my associates in real life.&nbsp; Many people here seemed legitimately seemed concerned, and offered us&nbsp; kind words.<br /><br />I heard a few stories from people with similar experiences, which it was nice to know that we weren&#039;t alone and that we could totally overcome freak incidents like this.&nbsp; I was offered financial support by over 4 people to make up for my loses, some of whom hadn&#039;t even purchased from me.&nbsp; We turned the offers down because the last thing we need is more debt and our heads are still above water, but the mere gestures really hit home.<br /><br />And to top it off, the guy whose order WE messed up sent us a few bucks just because he knew we lost money on the deal.&nbsp; I just want everyone to know that we are at least on our way back to being were we started and are even starting to pay off our debts because luckily had enough money tied up in SR whenever we were robbed to keep going.<br /><br />We really appreciate all of your support, it was one of the things that made us decide to try again and not just cut our losses.&nbsp; I know that none of us can have too much trust in one another here, but I&#039;ve gotten screwed over just as much in real life but when I get screw over either way, this community has shown itself to be very generous.<br /><br />I find it startling that a place like this is even able to exist. The only way to keep it here is if the majority of us keep our honesty and our integrity.&nbsp; We just want to thank everyone for helping to make this such a great community to be a part of.<br /><br />-fable(d)

				Glad to hear you&#039;ve had a good experience to restore some of your faith in mankind lol... but use paragraphs please.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />You&#039;ll find that most people on this planet are inherently good and do want to see you succeed, but there are plenty of people out there that are shady and out for themselves.<br /><br />You just gotta take that risk and eventually weed out the bad ones and carry on.&nbsp; (Although I&#039;m a bit of a shut in and still need to work on this myself lol).

				Sorry to hear you were robbed.&nbsp; That really sucks hard.<br />It&#039;s hard on the head as much as the pocketbook.&nbsp; You&#039;re going to be pretty wary from now on I bet.<br /><br />I love the community here, we&#039;ve got a lot of great people.&nbsp; I think the novel idea of silk road appeals to the right crowd, and most of us are good folks.&nbsp; <br /><br />No matter what community you look at, there are always a few bad apples, but there are more good folks than bad out there... the good ones don&#039;t make as much noise is all.
