				I have gotten about 40 orders, packed them and only then found out about this. I will honor the orders because I guess most customers must have lost out as well in the BTC crash but since im on expose escrow this puts me several thousands of $ out of pocket. Every person who bought on SR with the intention of defrauding vendors by arbitraging the wrong exchange rate should be ashamed. To everyone with honest intentions, no harm done.<br /><br />I will have considerable less capital to restock now but will work my way to the top again, im sure all you guys will help me with that by ordering again once the BTC price is reflected correctly on SR.

Although you still have to get that money out and converted to USD before price fluctuates more.<br /><br />Anyway, I agree with the overall premise of the thread, that there was an issue with price being pegged to the Gox weighted average yesterday. A better way of updating the currency could be useful.<br /><br />The thing is, though, that there is ALREADY a method for vendors staying safe from this type of problem. You use the hedging option. Nearly every vendor is using expose escrow because the price has been going up so much that they gained from doing so. Yesterday and today the price DROPPED big time, and those vendors that are exposed lose a bunch of money.<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing wrong with this, that&#039;s the vendor&#039;s choice. And I don&#039;t want to hear other vendors bitching about losing a ton of money because they DECIDED to go exposed. How much profit have the already made staying exposed? A LOT. And that&#039;s because you&#039;re taking a high risk / high reward option. That&#039;s all fine.<br /><br />One REAL problem that I see is that vendors that WERE hedged could have gotten screwed if their buyers finalized while SR&#039;s price was at $230 while the actual price of coin was at $150. That&#039;s just because of the same issue of price updating, though, which needs to be fixed.

				Well it looks like someone is reading this thread, my price per bitcoin dropped to 70 per and then back up to 120 (I think someone pegged it at current market price and then switched it over to 24 hour average on one of the none frozen exchanges).

				So, if I have a small order from a vendor I like that&#039;s already in transit, would it&#039;d be best to FE to ensure that they get the proper dollar amount for their product? Given the rapid decline, I&#039;d hate to see my trusted vendors get ripped off (I know crazy of me) or does hedging orders protect the from this decline? I&#039;m under the impression that it doesn&#039;t.

				Sellers are better off waiting until mtgox resumes trading. I don&#039;t think the price on other exchanges is reliable in the current state because of their low volume compared to mtgox, a lot of people are dumping their btc due to fear that the mtgox price will crash when it resumes.
