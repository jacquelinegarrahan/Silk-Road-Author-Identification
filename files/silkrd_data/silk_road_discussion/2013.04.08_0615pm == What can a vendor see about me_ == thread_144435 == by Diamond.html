				[I *think* this question goes here...]<br /><br />As a buyer, I&#039;m curious what information about me is available to prospective vendors. I recently returned after a decent hiatus from SR, to make a few purchases, and as expected all my messages and account history have been purged off. My concern was that vendors would see me as a &quot;new&quot; buyer and request that I finalize early or jump through some other hoops to make my orders, even though I&#039;ve jumped through those hoops a long time ago.<br /><br />Do vendors &quot;rate&quot; buyers on the proper site? Are those permanent?

				Go to http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account/buyer_stats -- that&#039;s what they see.&nbsp; The link is available from your account page for future reference.

				We can only see how long you have been a member, how many purchases you have made, how much you have spent, your refund rate and how many transactions you have let auto finalize..<br /><br />Nothing personal.. just helps vendors decide weather to continue with your order etc..

				We can see your number of transactions, your refund rate, your auto finalize rate &amp; your total bitcoins spent, nothing you need to worry about us knowing about you, its not like we know what you had for breakfast last wednesday or anything&nbsp; :)<br /><br />As soon as we mark your order as in transit your stats are no longer viewable by us. Its a small price to pay as after your first 5 transactions we trust you to finalize on time and such. Just get past those 5 transactions and you&#039;ll have nothing to worry about :)

I was just worried that those numbers might &quot;clear out&quot; after a while like messages or anything, and vendors would see me as having 0 purchases. But I can see that in the above link I&#039;m good. Wasn&#039;t worried about other info beyond what I encrypt and send to vendors. Honestly I&#039;m glad that vendors have some access to non-specific info, keeps the trust level higher.<br /><br />Thanks guys
