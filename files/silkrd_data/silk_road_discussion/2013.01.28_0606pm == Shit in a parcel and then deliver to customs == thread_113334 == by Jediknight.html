				Is there anything illegal about taking a shit and then mailing it to someone?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure really.&nbsp; &nbsp;If it gets opened , they&#039;ll close it back up quickly and let it continue on? Or will they break it apart and dispose of it .&nbsp; Will the insurance pay for the missed delivery?&nbsp; Even if it was shit inside?&nbsp; <br /><br />Using shit to hide drugs could work for bulk orders .&nbsp; Makin&#039; stew for you.

It would make them exhaust more funds and budget to keep opening those packages and inspect.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bankrupt the customs and postal offices.&nbsp; Make it unfeasible to search and xray each package.<br />The near future, they will be x raying each package with automated x ray machines. yikes.

				I&#039;m not absolutely certain, but I believe that there is at least some law (in the US and almost certainly in Australia though that could be just for imports and not domestic orders) prohibiting the mailing of biological specimens without proper registration.

				I didn&#039;t mean making a pressurised bomb, just something barely pressurised (even less than a shaken soda can) that spits out stinky liquid when opened. like a biscuit jar with a locking airtight lid filled to the brim with shitty water.<br />&nbsp;<br />Obviously you wouldn&#039;t use your own shit and there would be no messing around and slowing down deliveries if it was done for the one day of the year. if anything you&#039;d have improved chances

(<br />How about if you&#039;re an American or Canadian, you ship a parcel to UK/Australia, and if you&#039;re in UK/Oz, do vice-versa, since you cannot send an international package to your own customs port :/<br /><br />Although there are seldom reports from UK peeps not receiving parcels, tell me if I&#039;m wrong but I think only heavy handwritten packages are flagged.<br /><br />Ideas on a shit-smeared postcard please.

For the most part, they&#039;re good hard-working blue-collar guys that get shit on enough as it is - especially those that have to pull mail out of the street corner boxes.<br /><br />What&#039;s the target? If banks and credit card companies are good targets. Wipe a dog&#039;s ass on a credit card application and mail it in... bonus that it&#039;s prepaid! Easy enough to do so many could join in - empowering in a way that would make a good political statement.

				This is the shittiest thread I&#039;ve seen in a while.....<br /><br />Some jedi action huh. Getting off on your own shit. Would you be pleased if your sister or mother opened a box of someones shit? <br /><br />Granted I think it would def go down in history. But it will change the games if people have to start fearing bio hazzards at their place of work/business. Want to keep receiving your coke and buds? Keep not shitting in boxes and sending it places. <br /><br />People are just doing a job. To pay their rent and shit. When you get old enough to be on the street sucking on shit to pay your bills you will understand.

Or will they break it apart and dispose of it .&nbsp; Will the insurance pay for the missed delivery?&nbsp; Even if it was shit inside?&nbsp; <br /><br />Using shit to hide drugs could work for bulk orders .&nbsp; Makin&#039; stew for you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes it is illegal.<br /><br />Firstly it is harassment and there are laws that would deal with that.<br /><br />Secondly its a bio hazardous material and therefor you cant just pop it in an envelope and pop a stamp on it, there are rules and regulations for the transportation of bio-hazardous materials which must be complied with by law.<br /><br />So if you sent it via standard mail then you would be committing a multitude of crimes.<br /><br />If you wanted to send it legally then it would cost quite a lot of money as it would need to be sent in a container that was suitable for transporting bio hazardous materials, it would require the appropriate paperwork filled in both the sending and receiving countries and it would probably require a specialist courier who would charge you a premium for the service<br /><br />So crapping in an envelope and putting it in the post is illegal, where as sending bio hazardous materials is perfectly legal but cost quite a bit of money and would require you to submit the appropriate paperwork.<br /><br />In short, grow up.<br />

				As a former LEO I can say confidently that, unless something has changed in the last 2 or 3 years, you can NOT pull DNA from feces.&nbsp; Believe it or not, the most common thing that burglars leave behind after breaking into an unoccupied store or home is a steaming pile of shit.&nbsp; It&#039;s the adrenaline, I guess.&nbsp; But, there was always a rookie on hand to ask the detective if he should try to bag some of the poo, and the detective would always say yes, to fuck with the new guy.&nbsp; But, you never sent shit to the lab, because you can&#039;t get DNA out of shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />The ONE exception to all of that would be if you had a murder, and there was a steaming pile of BLOODY shit, you&#039;d try to collect the blood.&nbsp; You&#039;d still probably come up with nothing, but it&#039;s a murder, so you grasp at every straw.<br /><br />My two cents.&nbsp; Cheers.

				I&#039;m amazed this thread is still of interest (I&#039;m the Original Poster)<br />Everyone loves shit and customs in the same sentence ha ha<br /><br />If nobody has already, you should really check out National Geographic Channel&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Border Security and To Catch a Smuggler shows.<br /><br />They reveal in detail how they look for drugs.&nbsp; They showed a worker in front of an ex-ray machine and postal packages being fed into it one by one.&nbsp; &nbsp;He clearly skipped the letter size packages and focused on the bigger packages.&nbsp; They find everything that is bulk and then do a controlled delivery/&nbsp; &nbsp; and anything under a certain size (I&#039;m guessing 1 oz) they send a letter to the reciever and then destroy the package.&nbsp; They do scan the small ones sometimes peeps . . .&nbsp; it looked like a miserable job though.&nbsp; Although there really isn&#039;t that many packages going across the border.&nbsp; You could spot a vendor&#039;s package type and zero in on a vendor after a while if they use the same packaging materials.&nbsp; There are about three large bins of packages to the inspected from each flight.&nbsp; &nbsp;You could see how a express-post packaging purchased from the post office and letter sized, would slip by easily.&nbsp; Its the odd packages and the ones that are hand wrapped that really stand out.&nbsp; It has to look commercial and business-like.<br /><br />One example is a sealed container of vitamins being imported.&nbsp; Once they opened it up for a closer look, they could see the vitamins looked kinda like pills.&nbsp; They tested it and it was all Xanax.&nbsp; They can test everything on the spot.<br /><br />Another factor is that they swab the outside of the packages for traces of drugs.&nbsp; Then, that flags it for closer inspection/x ray.&nbsp; Something to think about when vendors are handling packages.. ...<br /><br />Alternatively, I wonder if adding a few hundred dollar bills to your package would help get it across the border?<br />
