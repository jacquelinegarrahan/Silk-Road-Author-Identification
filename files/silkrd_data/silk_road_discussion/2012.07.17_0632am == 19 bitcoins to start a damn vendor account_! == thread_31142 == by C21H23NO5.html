				That&#039;s chump-change compared to the money you make from being a successful vendor, so basically if you can&#039;t afford that small start-up price you shouldn&#039;t be selling at all. Seriously, how are you going to afford shipping and buying bulk product to sell if you can&#039;t afford the $150 vendor price? If anything it should cost more, but at least it stops smaller scammers from flooding the market.

				Anyone who cannot get 19 BTC ought not to be a dealer in the first place!<br /><br />Costs to sell here, the fee is fair given the potential for profits. Also, the fee makes sure a million junkie scammers do not get on here, sell a few deals of some good gear they got on credit and then its easy to screw you.<br /><br />Vendors also need a few BTC for the tools of the trade. Vac machine, vac seal bags, postage, packing and a few BTC for compensating any no shows.<br /><br />Plus, here is the deal maker - why the fuck should anyone risk life and liberty without reward?<br /><br />If I was lucky enough (and skilled with code) to create this, I would certainly think 19 BTC is fair and it sorts the wheat from the chaff.<br /><br />If we had no fees, millions of kids would be advertsing pure 100% REAL coke and so on.<br /><br />19 BTC is not a lot.<br /><br />Sure for me and you it is but most here just buy.<br /><br />Oh - the term &#039;SWIM&#039; is from some UK drug discussion forum, quite a good forum for basic info but they and other sites had a rule that was intended to stop people incriminating themselves. But its not any legal loophole. Plus its clearnet so anyone saying &#039;SWIM got a kilo of E&#039; is hardly going to be not looked at!<br /><br />Some might say &#039;my pet dragon took some cocaine&#039;. Silly now but ten years ago maybe it was kind of seen as safer than admitting things direct.

				I find it&#039;s quite funny that some people find it&#039;s expensive to pay 150$ to start selling on a market like this.. I mean, one can sell EVERYTHING and if one comes here to scam, then this is a great blocker, due to the fact that 150$ should block out most of the, earlier mentioned, junky swindlers. I hope that a vendor that can&#039;t cough up 150$ will never be vending and all of that SWIM shit, are You people really that silly, to think that some acronym is going to not raise suspicion towards You?! You are the one who is spreading the story, and if it&#039;s not You, then don&#039;t share it. I think that seems fair.<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Bluelight doesn&#039;t enforce the use of &#039;SWIM&#039; and I&#039;ve never seen anybody use it on the European forum.<br /><br />What&#039;s with the Bluelight hate as well? It&#039;s a great site to use for drugs discussion without idiots filling it with crap. Drugs-forum.com on the other hand is laughable and does enforce the fucking &#039;SWIM&#039; policy.<br /><br />Back on topic, the OP is an idiot.<br /><br />

				I guess I&#039;d like to apologize, not to any of you specifically, because you all ripped me for having good intentions, I was just irritated at more fees.<br />I now understand how a fee would help in preventing SOME&nbsp; scammers.<br /><br />You guys get pretty riled up over some stupid shit, which is dumb because if you just took the time to help people rather than question their capabilities - then SR could be a much better place in several aspects, for client/vendors alike.<br /><br />Also, this &quot;$150&quot; so called fee isn&#039;t just 150$.&nbsp; <br />1) first id have to get a fat cut taken out of my bitcoin order<br />2) then i&#039;d get cut that 150 for the account<br />3) then i&#039;d have to send out samples of product out of my pocket just to earn the trust of members<br /><br />Still doesn&#039;t sound like a lot?&nbsp; Well, to be honest, at the moment I don&#039;t have all the $ to spend on this type of thing.<br />I still have to re-up on some yay - 700$ [I have that]<br />Rent is due in 10 days - (not exact amount - could potentially give off details) ~ 625$ [I have that]<br />I have the opportunity to get 100 - 30mg non-generic Roxies - 650$ [I&#039;m still working on this]<br />The fee for a vendor account - +150$ (depending on bitcoin rate) [This is my last priority]<br /><br />I don&#039;t see why my current financial situation in anyway could infer that I wouldn&#039;t make a good vendor.<br /><br />Not to mention that I still have to eat somewhere between those expenses.&nbsp; Ive been eating like a damn college student trying to save up for all these &#039;fees&#039;.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So feel free to be all condescending and shit, but I will be a vendor, and it wont be long.&nbsp; I always understood that it took money to make money, but you got to understand that normal people aren&#039;t exactly in as good of situations as other to straight up jump on SR and open up shop. <br /><br />Sorry about yesterday. I suppose.&nbsp; I was just shocked initially.<br /><br />As for the my use of &quot;SWIM&quot;,&nbsp; I think it&#039;s funny, and on a personal note, I could NOT give 2 shits that it bugs anyone.&nbsp; I assure you that Tor/Bitcoins are not by any means a surefire way to protect yourself.&nbsp; LE doesn&#039;t need a real IP address, or paper trail to catch you.&nbsp; You ever hear anything called Forensics?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not talking finger prints, or even with most of you assholes talking shit - when you spit while you talk and some lands on the packaging [Because a lot of people are probably in a data base somewhere from previous arrests].<br /><br />Im talking real fucking forensics.&nbsp; If SWIM learned anything in his Analytical Chemistry class, it was how easily LE tracked down several suspects based on negligible amount of pollen from a plant that was only indigenous to a very specific area in the world.&nbsp; That narrowed down the location tremendously.&nbsp; THEN, judging by the amount in parts per million, they were virtually able to pin-point the dude(s) whereabouts to a citywide radius.&nbsp; You people act like top-vendors aren&#039;t disappearing all the fucking time, open your eyes and SWIM with caution.<br /><br />&quot;Oh C21H23NO5, you&#039;re stupid, I don&#039;t have any plants like that&quot; - well smartass, if the DEA thought it was worth their time, then they could test for all sorts of dead give aways.<br /><br />-hairs<br />-animal hairs<br />-the type of adhesive on the tape you use<br />-the damn ink you buy when you print all your shipping tags<br />-the DUST in your house (dust is over 50% of your dead skin)<br />-specific residues from different latex gloves / fingerprints<br />-you better pray that people working in the post office that ship your mail dont leave a forensic trail, cause you just lost a post office entirely and would never know it.&nbsp; There are basically so many parts to shipping that you yourself cannot control that you can never be guaranteed piece of mind.<br />-etc...&nbsp; everything you cant account for, can and might be.&nbsp; <br /><br />God, I could go on for days.&nbsp; Dont believe me - please open up you &quot;Quantitative Chemical Analysis&quot; -by Harris (any edition above 6 to be safe), and open to the first damn page.<br /><br />So unless you are working in some super lab, that owns its on post office.&nbsp; SWIM SWIM SWIM SWIM SWIM<br /><br />Oh shit, I wish I would stop remembering things, but also by not saying SWIM, you destroy any chance at a non-guilty plea in court if somehow they did find you thru SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;A similar example - lets say you&#039;re driving in your car with some dope in the trunk/glovebox/whatever, and a cop pulls you over and asks to search the car.<br />A) you let him search it, he finds it, and you got to jail.&nbsp; THE END<br />B) you tell him that you do not consent to searches, he holds you &amp; waits, then obtains a search warrant &amp; then finds the dope, you go to jail. NOT THE END, the fact that you did not consent to the search and seizure makes it substantially easier in court for your attorney to get the charges dropped.. If you dont believe me on this one, please call any local attorney you can find in your phone book.<br /><br />Now they have your computer, and it basically says several times that YOU, and not SOMEONE ELSE, admitted to the charges presented against you.<br /><br />Fucken Rookies, PEACE!

				Ahhhh another one of my least favourite threads. <br /><br />1. If you can&#039;t be arsed to pay, GTFO. Just to put things into perspective for you OP I made over £3000 this week and it&#039;s fuckin Tuesday lol. I never talk about how much I earn but I am fucking tired of seeing this bullshit whining about paying for something that can make you veeeery comfortably off. It&#039;s nice to see that we are now in a culture of freeloaders that expect the world owes them everything.<br /><br />Oh yeah and the person who said this is definitely SOMEONE WHO IS FUCKING ME. Take that crap back to the clearweb lol.<br /><br />Also Yudo BMR is a den of sin, thieves and whores and is run by a douchebag with sand up his vagina. Seriously stay away mate, you may as well be walking into the Black Hole of Calcutta.

				LOL, &amp; good job with your operation man.&nbsp; Shame you had to break your own rule and discuss your income.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure atleast 3/4ths of that goes back into replenishing your supply, followed by 1/8th of if going towards commission.&nbsp; Leaving you with a whopping 650.&nbsp; Congrats man, you have risked prison for minimum wage. <br /><br />It&#039;s only Tuesday tho?&nbsp; Oh, so then that means you have a large scale operation and must launder your money or else risk the &quot;tax-man&quot; having an unhappy review on your bank account statements, now you lose 50% of your profit to that.<br /><br />I think you might pull in 5000 a month for you to split with your entire crew..&nbsp; Seems like less than minimum wage actually.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe this is not the case at all for you, maybe you are really just ballin.&nbsp; &nbsp;But you really arent shit in the scope of things.&nbsp; Safer, smarter, and all around better vendors have been caught.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t understand why everyone thinks they can just pause the movie before scareface gets killed.&nbsp; Live it up now man, because I don&#039;t predict any happy endings in your future.<br /><br />I have a pretty good feeling you will blow whatever you currently have, and then more on top of that.&nbsp; Oliver was right, you are a pretty immature vendor.&nbsp; Not exactly the best strategy for laying under the radar.&nbsp; &nbsp;And believe me, the only safety you have in any of this - is the safety bubble in your head.&nbsp; Best regards tho.&nbsp; I don&#039;t wish trouble on anyone here.&nbsp; At the most, probably to trip while walking down the street, but thats it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cheerio mate

				Funny, I dont feel embarrassed at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;As far as limitless, he can suck it.&nbsp; I dont care if he cured cancer, aids, and solved world hunger.&nbsp; He&#039;s an immature douchebag, and as far as you go,&nbsp; I can&#039;t say much different about his followers.<br /><br />I can name 15 neighbors of mine alone that care that i pay rent tremendously, not including people that may live as far as, oh sayyyy across the street.&nbsp; as with the various other things i mentioned.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dont have any &quot;issues&quot;, Just a temporary hold on my expansion<br /><br />unlike limitpiss, when he suddenly disappears from SR one day, nobody will remember him after he&#039;s gone.&nbsp; What will be left is this discussion.&nbsp; I will be the first to post &quot;I told you so&quot; in his honor.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You wanna keep talking shit?&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; Your responses are pathetic, and amount to nothing but childish shit talking and nothing more. Not very clever of shit talking at that.

				Lol. Silly little boy. This is all pretty irrelevant when it&#039;s coming from someone who can&#039;t even shell out 90 quid for an account. Cheap-ass mother fucker. <br /><br />Oh and I am not going anywhere kid, apart from if it&#039;s to your mothers house because she hasn&#039;t sucked my balls dry yet today.
