				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I placed an order early yesterday and by late evening, my order still was showing &quot;processing.&quot; This morning I checked and the vendor has gone into stealth mode. Can anyone explain why a vendor would go into stealth mode and if I should be concerned?<br /><br />My previous orders with other vendors have gone without a hitch, with the &quot;processing&quot; status changed to &quot;in transit&quot; within a few hours. Maybe I&#039;m spoiled?

				There are a lot of reasons this could happen. It could be (provided it is a US vendor) that the vendor put it into vacation mode so stop new orders. This would give him time to process the orders he has and leave for a short vacation seeing as it is a holiday.

				I&#039;ve had vendors go stealth right after I place an order. Never had a problem so far and all my packages have made it here. As long as the vendor you ordered from is reputable I wouldn&#039;t worry.

				Vendor&#039;s aren&#039;t supposed to mark it in transit until it is actually shipped. It is a long weekend here in Canada so why would I mark it shipped when it actually won&#039;t be moving until Tuesday? That just looks bad on me. Asking why a vendor went into stealth mode? There are many topics already about this. There could be many reasons. He could simply be on vacation and does not want to come back to an ass load of orders, or he could be happy with his current customer base and no longer wants to sell to new people. Any vendor you use and like or seem to like you should become a fan of theirs so you can still access their page, even when he/she goes into stealth mode.......

I make them as in transit when they are packaged and stamped. Most are not in the mail tell the next day when the post picks them up. However, I also mail my customer and let them know the exact day it will be picked up. But I tend to process my orders in the evening.

				Thanks everyone for your replies. I did do a forum check on stealth mode as well as read the wiki, but I didn&#039;t feel I received a satisfactory understanding about the topic, hence, my thread.<br /><br />The vendor has a stellar reputation, so I&#039;m sure everything will be fine. I just thought it odd that the day after listing his product, he went into stealth mode. It makes sense with a following like his and a long weekend, he probably got enough orders the first day.<br /><br />Since I&#039;m new, I&#039;m used to having to FE which I can&#039;t do until the order is &quot;in transit.&quot;<br /><br />I appreciate everyone being patient with my noob questions ...
