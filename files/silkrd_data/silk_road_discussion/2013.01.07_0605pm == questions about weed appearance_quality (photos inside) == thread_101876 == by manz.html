				I ve been smoking weed occasionally for the last 5-6 years, always local dealers (south EU) and some samples I got from SR lately. I was never able to tell big differences in weed quality, I can tell if the stuff is more/less strong than usual or if it feels more like indica or sativa by the kind of buzz I get but not great differences. Seeing guys here and in other forums beeing able to compare very similar strains or&nbsp; judging by the looks of weed always raised some questions.<br />What are the different kind of high you get, is it a side effect some strains give you or anything else? What makes a strain AAA/medical ? What does the appearance tell you about it?<br />Also how do you recognize sprayed weed, if that&#039;s possible.<br /><br />I recently got a small deal (2g) where I was for holidays, he gave it to me with a sorry face &quot;that&#039;s the best I could find these days&quot;, but in my eyes it looks fine and I got a normal couchlocking high. So I got some photos if anyone can see something wrong with this. The white marks I thing are called crystals and the orange thingies trichomes, supposedly containing lots of THC if I&#039;m right... right? <br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/viz.jpg<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/vi6.jpg<br /><br />Thanks for your help any info will be much appreciated.<br />

				The white is both the Trichomes or &#039;crystals&#039; in slang. The orange &#039;hairs&#039; are called pistils, there just the genital part that catches the male pollen. They don&#039;t really do much to be fair.<br /><br />The bud looks ok, pretty stick heavy, and doesn&#039;t look to be 2g?<br /><br /><br />Your post reminded my of this comic it&#039;s pretty funny:<br /><br />**clearnet**<br />http://i.imgur.com/NfGgu.jpg<br />**clearnet**

				agreed with SNSG - the bud looks fine, as far as my US-based standards go. not top quality or anything, but a decent mid-to-high grade; definitely stem-heavy though.

				Its a fine line sometimes between high grade and AAA stuff but ill do my best to explain the things i look for.&nbsp; Usually medical grade has more crystals and if its green will be lighter in shade.&nbsp; The buds will be manicured which means one stem per bud and most the leaves will be trimmed off, no seeds.&nbsp; Also, medical grade bud usually has a stronger smell and a unique smell depending on the strand.&nbsp; You can tell also from the taste but that is harder to explain u can just tell in my opinion whether it is or is not based on the taste.&nbsp; But generally you can tell by looking at how nice the buds are manicured and how much trichome coverage there is. Hope this helps if not the more AAA stuff you get and smoke the easier it will be for you to tell

I wish I had a more scientific answer - usually I do, and plenty of others here will surely fill in the gap. I gotta say, for me it&#039;s a bit of an experiential thing. I know what to smell for, and once you smoke enough and shop around, you&#039;ll know what you do and don&#039;t like in a smell and taste. honestly, I&#039;d say start doing your bud shopping here on SR if you can. knowing exactly what you&#039;re smoking and having a forum here full of reviews to supplement your own will help you build a palate of sorts. <br /><br />as for what I personally look for? I like my weed to relieve pain and help with some ferocious insomnia, so I look for crystal density to check the potency, and know that I lean towards indica strains when I can. if you know what you want from your weed, discerning quality should become easier. just my $.02 though! :)

				Sativa buds are smaller nuggets. They are mostly lighter in green colour and really don&#039;t have as much trichomes build up. The high is heady and cerebral. Good for socializing or for doing stuff while stoned. <br /><br />Indica buds are fat and dense. Some have high concentrate of trichomes other don&#039;t. Indica is usually dark green and taste stronger. All medicinal pot is Indica and very couch lock. <br /><br />You do have a hybrid of both but from experience the hybrid tends to be more indica dominant. <br /><br />As for outdoor/indoor..depends on the method of grow and how much its fed. Theres this theory around that hydro and outdoor are two completely different strains, which is all crap. It&#039;s just the area or medium where it&#039;s grown.
