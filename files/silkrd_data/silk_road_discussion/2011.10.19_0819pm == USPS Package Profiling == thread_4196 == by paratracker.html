				This is an old article (Feb-Mar 1996), so might be old news to veteran Silk Road sellers, but it will certainly be useful for newbies.&nbsp; It tells you how the US FBI and USPS profile packages and decide which ones should receive special attention, e.g. drug dogs, opening for inspection, successfully prosecuting the recipient, etc.&nbsp; In case the link gets killed, the citing is: &quot;Profiling postal packages&quot; by Mark T. Langan, Gerald Vajgert.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link I found (multiple detailed pages):<br /><br />http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2194/is_n2-3_v65/ai_18447923/

				+1<br /><br />good article. I don&#039;t think we have this type of worry six years later though -<br /><br />When we rotate addresses as sellers, rotate drops as buyers, and use PGP.<br /><br />Some of us go beyond PGP and get ultra secure which was not an option for us in the late 90&#039;s.<br /><br />Today we have the power as the people.<br /><br />Stay safe and smart is the continual message though, thanks for sharing this.
