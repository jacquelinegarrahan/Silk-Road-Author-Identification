				Okay, I know this is going to sound strange but just hear me out with a open mind.<br /><br />Since I have joined Silk Road it seems the under lying focus here has been to defy our governments but if you really think about it...How can we really win? We can&#039;t, it&#039;s too late. If a group of us were to ever gather we would be the target of a drone strike and dismantled immediately or any other tool they have which is 50 years ahead of what we will ever see.<br /><br />Now, you might ask, well what can a government or some sort of higher entity possibly do with a tool like Silk Road. This is what I believe, Silk Road exist to further detoriate the progress of your average free thinking citizen who wants to experiment with some illicit substances. Silk Road is here to supply you with every drug you want to further their agenda of martial law, world wide. That simple. This place exists simply to create another problem they can control. <br /><br />Any thoughts? Or do you think I am just going a little nutty?<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				+1 for thinking outside of the box lol.

				Yeah interesting thoughts...<br /><br />I&#039;m not quite sure what you meant? If a group of us were to gather we would be the subject of a drone strike? <br />I thought the whole point of this was not to gather? remain anoymous blah blah...<br /><br />Restince movements exist all over the world and are not killed by the goverment (though some are) I mean you wouldnt get a drone strike on the 99% occupy movement. Though you do get a lot of angry coopers breaking bones and crushing soles.<br /><br />This website is defying our government, so we are winning.<br /><br />It seems a lot of people think the goverment want to control everything, in some cases that is correct. <br />I believe that is more complicated than that. Why would a goverment want to control everything? <br />For shits and giggles? Not in my mind.<br /><br />Goverments such as those that govern the USA have certain idelogies they live by and try and strive towards. In the search of theses dangerous idelogies wars get started and society is unequal. <br /><br />However as a person said previously a lot of it comes down to money and would the goverment really want<br />silk road and venders of course making all this cash ? Now you can make a good argument for the privitised prison system which profits offer how many prisoners are in jail at any given time, they certianly dont want the drug war to end.<br /><br />I could go on but I might be getting a bit carried away..<br /><br />Anyway this is just my thoughts, you are not crazy dude, or maybe you are, the best people are crazy..

				Since were commenting on this subject, you know what is evil, the killers that are running the streets and not giving a fuck about society.&nbsp; Drugs is kool to realax and chill.&nbsp; For example, if you gave inmates weed on a daily basis there would be no crime in prisons.&nbsp; Just a thought and a law to pass. So SR isn&#039;t harmful, its harmless.

				Interesting thoughts, however I am reminded of a seen from Babylon 5<br /><br />Sheridan: &quot;You know, I was thinking about something you said &#039; The pre-eminent truth of our age is that you cannot fight the system&#039; But, if it is as you say, the truth is fluid, the truth is subjective, then maybe we can fight the system. As long as just one person refuses to be broken, refuses to bow down.<br /><br />*other person*: &#039;But can you win?&#039;<br /><br />Sheridan &#039;Every time I say no!&#039;<br /><br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caqqBllZX1k<br /><br />We can fight the system and we win every time one of us says NO! Every time one of us stops doing what we are told and decides our own fate, every time a single person fights we win.<br /><br />It is not about you or me, it is about freedom! No amount of government and no law can take it away as long as there is one person who is willing to fight for there god given rights.

				Silkroad is a service to the community... <br /><br />no fronted drugs, no drug deals gone bad, it takes a bit of work to get your btc to even buy anything, so that cancels out impulse drug buys. I&#039;d say the majority of the users of SR are on the more responsible side of drug users.&nbsp; Let Johnny Law work the beat and leave this place in peace...<br />

				@OP.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think so. I freely admit it is possible for a government to use drugs as a tool for political control. I&#039;ve mentioned the concept several times before as one under appreciated reason for the government not to control the means of recreational drug production. Chemical coercion where people are forced to take mind control pills is a definite possibility, something like it has happened a couple of times in history but done with modern science for an explicit purpose would be an absolute disaster for any freedoms. Even now in Russian and China dissidents are called &quot;insane&quot; and thrown into prisons to be forcefed a potent mix of mind bending drugs. Think: One flew over the Cuckoo&#039;s Nest, but on a much larger institutional scale. Those drugs are note remotely recreational, but the point stands.<br /><br />However I don&#039;t believe this dystopia is possible in a free market. Nor is a Brave New World possible in a free market. A market moderates and ameliorates the worst excesses of humankind due to a combination of factors such as price, diversification and the basic voluntary opt-in principal of marketplace transactions. For example: very few people will opt in to taking opiates due to concern about losing self control as opiates are known to be more compelling than many other drugs. Most people smoke weed, take MDMA or smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. Individuals being free to make an independent judgement call is by far the best method of harm reduction there is. People aren&#039;t stupid. Some of the time maybe, but not all the people all the time.<br /><br />In other words, it makes underlying business sense for the Silk Road to have functional drug users for custom, not deranged lunatics constantly flaking out. The politicians of a nation state may have plans that are not connected to economic imperatives though.<br /><br />Finally, SR is definitely not a tool of the State because the vendors and staff, are definitely not pro-government.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156575.msg1097930#msg1097930">Quote from: FreedomOutlaw on May 07, 2013, 12:14 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you look at the former Soviet Union, you will find the black markets played a pivotal role in the collapse of the economy.

Well, I guess that is a really long shot, but I don&#039;t think this is the case with Silk Road b/c of the way SR Support, or what passes for SR Support, handles things and the lack of elements on both SR m AND SR f which you would naturally want to exploit if you were a government consortium in control of Silk Road. I&#039;ve never believed DPR to be a badge or a govt, just a really reclusive person who writes [edit.], okay fine, writes seldom which was put down to (in a clearnet article) circumventing profiling. I would not be here if I thought Silk Road was run by cops or governments. <br /><br />I was amazed to find a post written by someone who had actually.... thought.... something. I was shocked so I had to respond. :) Some other threads I see started around here, make me wonder about the skool they went to... ::)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				There is no absolute good or evil, they are just arbitrary human terms which definitions even vary from person to person. So no, Silk Road (or anything else) can not possibly be actual &#039;evil&#039;.

				one word answer: no<br /><br />longer version: it is a tool that can facilitate change amongst other things - good/evil/cool/sucky are words of judgement, and since judgements only exist inside our own heads.....<br /><br />i trust you&#039;ll do the linguistic math. :-)<br /><br />(or disagree because im ok with that)<br /><br />

We can&#039;t, it&#039;s too late. If a group of us were to ever gather we would be the target of a drone strike and dismantled immediately or any other tool they have which is 50 years ahead of what we will ever see.<br /><br />Now, you might ask, well what can a government or some sort of higher entity possibly do with a tool like Silk Road. This is what I believe, Silk Road exist to further detoriate the progress of your average free thinking citizen who wants to experiment with some illicit substances. Silk Road is here to supply you with every drug you want to further their agenda of martial law, world wide. That simple. This place exists simply to create another problem they can control. <br /><br />Any thoughts? Or do you think I am just going a little nutty?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I thought the whole point of this anonymity thing is to prevent any sort of targeted persecution. Ya know, unleash the power of networking/anonymity/encryption.<br /><br />How can we really &#039;win&#039;? Use these technological tools we have to allow grassroots cultural movement(s) to take form and prosper; whether they be anti-government, pro-recreational drugs, pro-free market, or whatever, you get the idea.<br /><br />I recommend reading &quot;Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy&quot;, edited by John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt.<br /><br />It can be downloaded free from the RAND Corporation: http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1382.html<br /><br />

				You pose interesting thoughts, however first you should define evil.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really see the majority of us here as anarchists so much as capitalists seeking freedom from the restrictions imposed by authorities beyond our immediate ability to change
