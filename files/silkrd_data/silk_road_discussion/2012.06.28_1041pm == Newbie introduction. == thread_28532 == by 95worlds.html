				Just wanted to introduce myself to everyone as to start building reputation. I am a 23 yr old male who happens to live on earth in SC. I am not new to SR but I am new to the forum and buying from SR. If anyone has any tips or suggestions please comment. I am pretty knowledgeable on opiates and the opium poppy. I know how vendors look at someone new and see nothing bought and only a member for 2 months and wonder if I am real or not. <br /><br />Also feel free to ask any questions you may have especially vendors. <br /><br />95worlds&nbsp; &nbsp;

				welcome man, most venders are completely fine selling to new buyers, just means they may ask you to finalize early. which basically means you release the funds to them as soon as possible. Its sounds all very complex, but trust me, you&#039;ll know what i mean when it comes to it. <br />Also i like to only purchase from those who are trusted venders, i.e good rep, good product reviews etc.. unless of course they&#039;re a new vender giving out discounted samples for people to try. <br />you should also use a PGP encryption when sending your address. Makes it extra secure :) <br />other than that, enjoy your journey down the silk road :P

But I&#039;ve never had a single problem with anything i have ordered. Was it just opium you&#039;re looking to buy or anything else in particular and maybe i could point you in the direction of some good venders?

				made my first purchase yesterday. I am hoping everything goes well with it. It was a small purchase but better to start off small and build up is what I think will work best. any vendors looking for a new customer that sell opiates can contact me. I can&#039;t get anywhere with my regular Dr. as far as meds. so here I am.

				Thats wise, small orders are the way to go until you get a feel for the place and some good stats. I used relativity new sellers with good feedback so you can both stay in escrow. Always read the forums too, they are much more helpful than the feedback system.

Remember to never finalize early, it&#039;s understandable for you to do it on your first few buys, but most vendors don&#039;t require FE on small orders (reputable members have scammed before, no matter how nice people are this is still the internet. TRUST NO ONE) Other than that welcome to SR you&#039;ll find most members to be extremely nice and helpful. ;)
