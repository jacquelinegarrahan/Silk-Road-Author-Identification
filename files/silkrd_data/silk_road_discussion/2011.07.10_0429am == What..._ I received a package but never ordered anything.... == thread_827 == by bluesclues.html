				So I check my mail today, and there&#039;s an envelope that feels like a baggies inside. When I check the envelope, I found tan/brown powder (about 1g), but haven&#039;t ordered anything. The date on the envelope was July 6th :\. The powder is very clumpy and almost hard like pebbles. Anyone know what this could be?

				i would be leery to put that in my body. Especially since you have no idea from who it came.&nbsp; You should check to see if any vendors that you purchased from is offering what you think is H. While its a nice surprise, i would want to verify who sent it, I&#039;d probably toss it..

				dont know what to think about this. its really not cool to just randomly have shit show up. if you havent ordered anything in awhile means someones holding on to your address. i mean yea cool free skag but still wtf. and remember why sr started selling seller account caus someone threatened to send poison as drugs. be carefull.

				Is this some totally wonderful east coast skag, or yer ex trying to poison you?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Haha...imagine if were kicking junky, and this happened...what a dilemma...do I or don&#039;t I?<br /><br />I&#039;d pm any sellers you used, or do a process of elimination...it&#039;s not *that* big a deal...most people, they get a strange envelope, they put it back in the mail, don&#039;t worry about it...not us...could be...magic!

				It came from MO and I&#039;m on the east coast... I&#039;ve pm&#039;d sellers that sell brown powder drugs, and I&#039;m suspecting it&#039;s either very bad mescaline, heroin, or... idk? The substance is very hard, it&#039;s almost like soft crystals.

				I&#039;ve confirmed it&#039;s mescaline, it must have been my original order that never came... <br /><br />I&#039;m a little afraid it was opened or something because it&#039;s been 40+ days since I ordered that.

				this is a serious security flaw. no seller should be careless enough to ever screw up addresses. get order - prep order - put address on envelope - destroy all trace of address - ship.

				All of the above posters are correct.&nbsp; It is dangerous in the *extreme*.<br /><br />Therefore, I can&#039;t see any way for you to dispose of it properly *except* to send it to ME for proper disposal.<br /><br />Check your PM&#039;s.&nbsp; Don&#039;t dawdle; go now!&nbsp; ;)
