				Hey mates, (if i can say that here :-))<br />Did anyone of you ever thought on refusing small percentage refund and giving up the money solely for the purpose of keeping his perfect stats untouched? I was thinking about it and i&#039;m just wondering what&#039;s you toughts on that.<br /><br />*i know i&#039;m not giving out the details of my case ;-), but general answers will be welcomed.<br />

				Personally, I protect my stats.&nbsp; I gave up on a $190 refund to keep my stats clean.&nbsp; I was just getting to my 5th transaction and didn&#039;t want to start all over.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t do it again.&nbsp; Now that I am established with several of my favorite vendors, I would fight for the $190.

				I gave up about £20 when i was less established, wanted to protect my stats and it was to much effort to get the seizure letter online :/

				Once with a smallish amount of money I contacted the seller before it went&nbsp; into resolution, extend the finalize date by 5 days in resolution mode, wait a few more days then contact the seller and ask for a re-ship, then I immediately finalized and let fate do the rest.... Its better than a 50% refund if it comes through and if it dosen´t your 50% worse off but your stats are not affected.. at least they weren&#039;t in my case, but then again I was dealing with a really really good seller, Frank Mathews &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Recommended!! He looks after you.
