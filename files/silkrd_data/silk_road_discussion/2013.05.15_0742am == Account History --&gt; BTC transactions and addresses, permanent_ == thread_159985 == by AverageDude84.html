That plus the SR tumbler should make linking btc to an individual very close to impossible (I think).

				all your bitcoin transactions are logged in the blockchain anyway, so regardless of what is recorded and stored on SR, every transaction has a permanent record.&nbsp; but if you are buying bitcoin legally than you have nothing to fear, sending them to an SR address is not a crime (yet?)&nbsp; <br />there isn&#039;t a reason i can think of that you would need to give your real name to purchase coin either, manymany ways to get them anonymously.&nbsp; <br />you&#039;re not gonna get in trouble for using bitcoin....just maybe what ya buy with em :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The worse case scenario is you get a visit from cops (local, state, or federal) that have a search warrant for drugs/weapons/explosives. If you have none of the above, then the second to worse thing is tax evasion, whether state or federal. At which point, you can report your earnings/losses. SR marketplace has legal items listed, so you have committed no crimes unless they catch you with drugs or committing mail fraud.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sweat it. Feds are after big fish. Remember, agents have their careers and reputation at stake. They most likely won&#039;t waste time on dime bag buyers. You&#039;re a feeder fish. At best, they would use you for bait, but SR takes care of that. How can you snitch on an anonymous vendor? Other than shipping methods, which you should have properly destroyed anyway.<br /><br />Buyers: soak your shipping labels in water, so the Feds don&#039;t know where you package came from... etc... Destroy your packaging. Burn, crush, bury in shit... whatever it takes. This is as important as keeping your mouth shut.

				You guys are assuming a lot. They likely won&#039;t even get into your SR account in the first place.<br /><br />Have your Tor-browser in an encrypted Truecrypt file and keep it hidden/closed down when you&#039;re away from your computer.... I know if I ever got raided the LAST thing I would be worried about is them getting into my SR account. No drugs in my house so there&#039;s no grounds to confiscate any of my shit... and even in some bizare situation in which they do get my laptop, what are they gonna do torture me into giving up my SR information, when they probably can&#039;t even prove I used SR in the first place? For all they know I could have a buddy out of state that sends me shit.<br /><br />Use basic file encryption for your tor browser and you will be fine.
