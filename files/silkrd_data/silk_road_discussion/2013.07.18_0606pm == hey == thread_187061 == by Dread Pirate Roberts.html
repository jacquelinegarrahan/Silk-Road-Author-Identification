				How is everyone?&nbsp; I hope you are enjoying the forums!&nbsp; Just wanted to let you know that Libertas has been doing a great job reorganizing the categories and listings.&nbsp; Before he got started, there were no less than 3 separate areas for prescription drugs and more scattered about in other categories.&nbsp; He has consolidated them all into one place and organized the sub categories under that.&nbsp; Opioids and Ecstacy got cleaned up as well and he&#039;s onto the Psychedelics next.&nbsp; I hope this makes it easier to find what you are looking for!<br /><br />Keep cruizin&#039;<br /><br />DPR

				Hey DPR your threads need titles bro! Lol. <br /><br />I had noticed someone was tinkering with my listings last week and adding categories. I still have one or two things that don&#039;t have their own specific category and fall under the auspices of benzos. Nice of him to organize it all for me for the most part. <br /><br />Good work with all these updates. It&#039;s a hell of a lot easier to use the market now! <br /><br />

				I def. recognize and appreciate the category changes.&nbsp; As a frequent purchaser of addys and dexys I used to have to search area of stimulants and then the area of prescription and now it&#039;s just all under prescription where it belongs.&nbsp; Great stuff!&nbsp; <br /><br />And also I was thinking back to the first time I logged into SR about 9 months ago and how much faster this site is now than it was at that point.&nbsp; Combined with the speed, or lack thereof, of the TOR browser it used to feel like I was back to using a 56k dial up modem to surf.&nbsp; Click and wait 1 minute literally for page to load.&nbsp; Now I see that your servers deliver the info instantly to me.&nbsp; Great work!&nbsp; <br /><br />

Thanks. I think it&#039;s really convenient to have a comprehensive category like you guys developed. I can search for benzos by trade name and see how many listings are available domestically, internationally, etc. and get a feel for the market for things I might want to stock without having to use that bastard search bar. The prescription category was a bit of a clusterfuck. I carry some weird shit I don&#039;t know how to categorize sometimes. <br /><br />And as another user commented I also appreciate the new stimulant categories as I&#039;m trying to branch out into dexies and adderalls. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)
