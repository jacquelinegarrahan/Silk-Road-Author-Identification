				I hate to do this, but I have to vent about recent people PMing about samples:<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind giving samples at all. I generally give out samples each time I list a new item, but when people PM me saying that they will be my biggest customer if I can shill out a couple samples of my product that is already price ridicuously lower than any competitor.<br /><br />When I politely decline the same ole story comes to surface. &quot;If you can&#039;t send me a sample how can I trust you?&quot; Fucking really? Check my feedback! I know I may not have great feedback due to a very small amount of canceled orders that were fully refunded, but there are plenty other orders that do justice for my products.<br /><br />Also, there is escrow. I stay in escrow and never require FE. Come on people! If you&#039;re asking for a tiny sample and bragging that you have a big client base then just buy the damn drugs. They&#039;re priced to sell regardless of how cheap you&#039;re pushing them on the street.<br /><br />Get real! Buy the product and you&#039;ll be very happy! And if you are who you say you are then in the future I will hook you up.<br /><br />-and that is what really grinds my gears

				I get like 5 messages a day from potential customers who tell me how they are interested in buying ounces of coke and kilos of speed but they want a sample first... well after sending out at least 500 pounds worth of samples and most of these guys never wrote back again I now just tell them that by now I&#039;ve built a pretty good reputation and there are reviews on the forums about my products and blah blah .. and they can just buy a small amount if they are still unsure (I mean someone who&#039;s interested in buying large bulk amounts should probably have enough cash to afford 1g of speed ...)... their usual answer to that is &#039;Oh too bad , I really was going to buy 10 kilos of you but if you&#039;re not willing to send me a free sample I&#039;ll take my cash somewhere else .. if you change your mind here&#039;s my adress[...]<br /><br />No more free samples from now on except for when I offer a new product .. and then I&#039;ll only send samples to well-known forum members.<br /><br />Cheers

				This is common, I get a few every month. Normally start by saying they are a big dealer and want to buy a large quantity. (4 or 5 lbs of mushrooms) however, they want to sample the product fist and then ask if I can send them a sample.<br /><br />I don&#039;t list or sell large quantities so they are just fishing.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I normally reply and ask them to send me there stats. 99% of the time they reply with a set of stats that seem off. <br /><br />Like this<br /><br />Total transactions: 2<br />Total spent: à¸¿1009.00<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 1 months<br /><br />So I send them a link to my mushroom pills in 1/8oz packs<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/2ba61d2b98<br /><br />They normally reply with some shit about not wanting to have to pay for a sample of the product because they will buy a large quantity if it is good. <br /><br />To which I reply<br /><br />&quot; Well, if you are not willing to spend the 2.75btc on a sample then why should I believe you have and are ready to spend 800+btc on a large order?<br /><br />Besides, every kid under 18 I have ever dealt with in real life tries to pull this shit. I can not count the number of idiots I had to beat the shit out of for pulling this. If I don&#039;t believe this shit in real life face to face deals why in the hell do you think I would believe this shit on SR?&quot;<br /><br />They normally stop responding at that point, but at least I got to waist some of there time.<br /><br /><br />I do send out samples from time to time but normally to established people here on the board. Come to think of it, I normally just double there initial order. Not sure if you want to call that a free sample or not.&nbsp; ;D

				It&#039;s truly sad because I message people out of the blue(not knowing them) and ask them if they want a sample. Usually I do because they give stellar reviews. Sometimes I do it because of ratings(being honest). And other times I do it out of kindness. I&#039;m sending a sample to someone for a bday present that I don&#039;t even know.<br /><br />Hell, I don&#039;t mind sending samples to people that ask either, but when they have some BS excuse after I turn them down about being some top notch buyer and how they can&#039;t trust my product then I won&#039;t consider them.<br /><br />I&#039;m running a business here and if I just gave out samples all the time then I get no where. Like other vendors said in the pas, &quot;This isn&#039;t Wal Mart!&quot; Fuck, Wally World doesn&#039;t even give out samples. When is the last time you&#039;ve seen the food samplers in the store? They&#039;re at Costco, but fucking Costco cost to be a member to just walk around the store.<br /><br />Damn I hate ranting about this. It makes me feel like a complete dick!

				OP,<br /><br />You can&#039;t feel like a dick for being real and posting up what you see from these types of people. If they really were gonna buy that much, they&#039;d have the cash to shell out for a sample...come on now...<br />if you are giving out any samples at all, more power to ya. you are doing what you can to expand your business. freeloaders and cheap skates aren&#039;t good business. <br /><br />the people who deserve samples are gonna be your quiet underdogs who secretly have a big wallet and desire to find a reliable vendor(s) and is testing the waters and lurking behind the scene to see who they should trust.<br /><br />keep doing your thing, don&#039;t sweat the BS. <br /><br />Cheers to good reviews and solid service and keeping the idea and spirit of SR alive..may u have good business come your way<br /><br /><br />i&#039;m gonna go hit up some tar i just scored today on the streets see what its like compared to what I can find online..wish I had a camera i could do a more detailed report and comparison

				I don&#039;t understand why it is even a question. Obviously if the buyer is running a program they can plow a few bucks into paying for their own merchandise to test out the quality. We aren&#039;t sitting around a campfire face to face here with all our cards on the table, we are completely anonymous. Whats to stop the little asshole who you send a free sample to from telling his friend with a different addy to make an account and ask you a week later for the same thing?

				Let&#039;s be honest, as a representative product, a sample could be worth shit anyway. Apart from it being a freebie which is all these guys are interested in. I&#039;m a buyer, but I would only ever expect to pay for small samples. Unless freebies were on offer of course :)

				I don&#039;t know why people accept free samples from new vendors anyway, it&#039;s the easiest way for LE to farm addresses. I certainly didn&#039;t offer freebies when I started even if I give them out every now and then now. I had paid for samples. <br /><br />

				What are you insinuating Lim?<br /><br />I know that LE could do this, but that is called entrapment. They do this anyhow, but some vendors give out samples because they just do.

Entrapment is when you are pushed into something by the police that you wouldn&#039;t normally do so they engineer you into committing the crime. Police get authorized to try and make bent sales all the time, if you didn&#039;t know that then you should staple what I am saying to the back of your hand. Also I am not saying YOU are Skippy_Jiff but look at that huge fuck up where that guy offered out H samples and then tried to blackmail people and then it happened again with The_Godfather and those other members who acted together. So when people just give away their addresses as soon as anyone says &quot;I&#039;m new, who wants some free shit&quot; is extremely naive.

				I know that. What I&#039;m saying entrapment is when an officer initiates a conversation with someone and pushes product onto them. That is entrapment. Any lawyer that gives a fuck could get this thrown out. Just because you agree doesn&#039;t make you guilty. Will you be arrested? More than likely. Will you go to prison? Depends on you/your attorney.<br /><br />I agree it is naive to give away your addy to someone you don&#039;t know, but LEA thrives on this shit. Majority of convictions are successful because of scare tactics and ignorance of the law. I agree that the overwhelming majority actually commit crimes they&#039;re accused of doing, but there is also strict protocol that insures a person his right to due process. And if a copper fucks this up the case shall be tossed......again depending on you/your attorney.<br /><br />And if you don&#039;t come over and get this damn chicken I guess I&#039;m going to be having wine spritzers and leftover chicken for dinner tomorrow! :kingcrankey:

				Put an announcement on your account page that states that you&#039;re not doing samples.<br /><br />People that have to beg for samples are not the ones that can dish out thousands for a bulk order.<br /><br />If they have the money for bulk, then they should be able to purchase a small amount to sample and not have it be a big deal.

				well my recently started seller account i offered, not free but samples at a hair above cost, this will be my only sample listing. I have never asked for a free sample as a buyer so i dont expect i will be offering them as a seller, should anyone ask i will give them a listing to my normal listings. I will only offer samples (not free) when i offer a new product so i can build some feedback on said product, and i will also screen the buyers, people with low or no feedback will not be getting cheap handouts

I don&#039;t ask for samples - unless they are offered. Since my time on SR, I have gotten two samples. One by a new vendor for whom I responded with an honest review, and the other (you know who ha) asked ME to sample one of his products for the community since I seem to know the product well.<br /><br />The first time I paid no shipping, the second time I did. I don&#039;t mind, I do it for the bettering of the community. I consider it the greater good. <br /><br />But nagging for samples isn&#039;t cool. Comes with the territory tho.

				i feel asking for free samples is fucked up because the majority&nbsp; of people just want free shit and might come back. <br /><br />I think a easy solution&nbsp; for a sample is to ask if you can pay for a single sample if your really trying to test the product it shows your not some fag trying to get free shit and it still makes the vendor money.

				If someone was a bulk buyer then surely they&#039;d be willing to buy a sample on which the price would be reimbursed upon a larger order? If you think about it that is technically a freebee anyway.

				As a procurer of various substances and one time vendor elsewhere, I think it&#039;s reasonable that a tax should be levied for samples. I think a good practice would be to provide samples only to those stating a future bulk purchase and limit samples to 50% of their respective effective dose at a cost of 100%. This is enough material to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis and establish an idea if one would like to proceed. Anything more is a handout to a fiend.

				Figured I&#039;d ask this here:<br /><br />I sometimes write vendors asking for &quot;samples&quot;. Not free samples, samples meaning, a .1-.5g for whatever price is fair, based on their 1g pricing. What do vendors think of this? I don&#039;t ask vendors who clearly state that they don&#039;t do custom listings, etc<br /><br />I do this for a few reasons. Mostly because I want to know the coke scene here, want to be able to provide a comprehensive review of everything for prospective buyers. Also, because personally, I wanna find the best HQ coke on SR. I honestly will become a longterm big customer to the vendor with the best fire. ...But buying whole grams off every C vendor would leave me wasting a lot of money on crap product from the less honest vendors. Just trying to minimize losses.<br /><br /><br />As for free samples, I don&#039;t understand people who would risk the reputation of their buyer account for a fucking .25g sample. It&#039;s just kind of bummy and I would feel like a junkie trying to grub free shit.
