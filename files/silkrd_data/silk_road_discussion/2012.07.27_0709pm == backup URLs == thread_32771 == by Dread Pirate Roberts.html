				Thank you! (The signature verified correctly, I encourage every user to check it too)<br /><br />I had a little concern the forum was hacked (happened to other .onion forums before). There were two post from DPR recently. The first one had an incorrect sig, the other had none. Both things were fixed quickly afterwards. <br /><br />If the forum really had been hacked, hackers could pretend to be anybody on the forum. So theoretically, a hacker could post from your (Guru&#039;s) forum account and give a fake pubkey for DPR. However now you signed the message, we can be very sure that the key you provided is indeed DPR&#039;s original pubkey, that was also used to signed the first post in this thread.<br /><br />+1 karma to you<br /><br /><br />tl;dr: The first post (with the 3 .onion urls) are legit.

				Just to add:<br /><br />The URLs are valid because I&#039;ve verified the signature, and everybody should make a copy of them somewhere.<br /><br />However I don&#039;t think they are intended to be used in this sort of situation.<br /><br />This DOS seems to be a flaw in how the Tor network implements hidden services using them may not help.<br />

Click that and you should see the message is validated as belonging to the same person who initially gave you the public key. Like I said already, in this case you got it from me, so this isn&#039;t very useful to you right now. However in the future you might find this feature of PGP useful. <br /><br />PGP is very useful for lots of things other than encryption, this is one of its uses. A similar use of PGP signing which is very important, is validating whether a Tor package download is legitimate/not fake. I strongly recommend everybody learn how to do this, because for all you know you&#039;re downloading the DEA&#039;s version of Tor unless you do this step. Seriously! <br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html<br /><br /><br />Note 1: Separate issue that may seem esoteric, but for newbies do NOT sign anybody&#039;s public key from SR forums unless you know to do it locally. Doing that is not useful in our situation on SRF (signing a public key uploads your signature to the web, which may not be your intention!), and you don&#039;t need to do it in order to use signing and verification anyway.<br /><br />Note 2: I think DPR uses a different public key for encryption, so PMing using this public key may not be appropriate.
