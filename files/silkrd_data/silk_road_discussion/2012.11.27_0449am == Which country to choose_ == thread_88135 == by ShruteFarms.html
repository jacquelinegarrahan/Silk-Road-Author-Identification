				I&#039;ve looked on the forums for a few hours now and can&#039;t seem to find the answer to my question. I was wondering if it more difficult/suspicious to order drugs from certain countries more so than others. Like would it be better for me to order something from Germany compared to the Netherlands or vice versa? I&#039;m ordering internationally regardless but I would like a more experienced user&#039;s opinion on the matter. I&#039;m ordering XTC or MDMA by the way.

				Definitely. Some countries are watched more than others. The Netherlands and Colombia are definitely watched, but I don&#039;t know the full list. It probably changes over time as drug trafficking patterns change.

				So I should probably avoid ordering from the Netherlands and try to find a good deal from a different country? My friend who used to use SR told me this as well but I was just curious what people on here thought or what a vendor from the Netherlands actually thinks about this. I definitely don&#039;t want to lose my shit in customs because I won&#039;t be able to afford to purchase again for awhile!

				If you&#039;re that concerned about losing the package, domestic shipping has the lowest chance of interception.

				I assume you live in the US. Netherlands is most definitely at the top of the list.<br />First, find a vendor you&#039;d like to order from. Make sure they are well established. Then head to forums and search for the vendor&#039;s review thread. You should get the picture once you are there.
