				UPDATE: I created a wiki page that might help clarify some of these changes: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Ratings_%26_Reviews<br /><br />ok, we&#039;re ready to push out the next update.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be closing the site for an hour or two while we do this.<br /><br />In this update we&#039;ll see a few changes.<br /><br />When you have finalized your order, you won&#039;t have to leave a review or a rating.&nbsp; When leaving a rating, you will see phrases next to the 1 - 5 scores giving you a sense of what they represent.&nbsp; If you have unreviewed transactions with a vendor, a link will appear on their page where you can leave a review.&nbsp; Reviews on a vendors page now have the buyer&#039;s stats, and the transaction stats.&nbsp; A vendor&#039;s rating widget links to a dedicated ratings and reviews page where you can see a breakdown of a vendors ratings, both weighted and unweighted, along with all of their reviews broken down by 1 - 5 groups.&nbsp; Also, all ratings and reviews will be final and uneditable.&nbsp; That means, if you have not received your order or tested it, you should not rate or review it!&nbsp; Oh yea, and you&#039;ll be able to sort reviews by weight or freshness.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy it!<br /><br />Once we get this pushed out and running smoothly, we&#039;ll move on to the next phase which will be looking at giving vendors more tools to judge buyers and protect themselves from scamming buyers.

				The forums are down and so is the site for obvious reasons.&nbsp; What worries me is that we have to go onto .to just to access the forums which is quite a worry.&nbsp; Thank you so much DPR for making these very important changes and improvements to make the site better and more user friendly and also protection for the buyer and vendor.&nbsp; But if you let us all know how long roughly you think you will be please as theres are customers that will get rude against me about their order not being prepared on time.<br /><br />I hope all goes well and thank you for my massive bonus for being an asset to SR! I love you!<br /><br />

				Hey! There&#039;s some guy playing &quot;taps&quot; on a bugle over on Atlantis. Sad day for Atlanteans. This update marks the beginning of the end for Atlantis. Now they have nothing over SR. (Nope, Litecoins ain&#039;t shit.)<br /><br />VENDORS - listen up. While this is great, great news. It comes with a price. Start increasing reserves because some orders may start finalizing a little later. Small price to pay for this much wished for update. <br /><br /><br />Can you hear the collective &quot;Noooooooooooooo&quot; from the buyer scammers? I swear the floor of SR just vibrated.&nbsp;

				Yeah, I like to Finalize the moment I have the product in - it&#039;s only fair to pay ASAP after all - but it means I have to leave a review even though the product is untested. Weed I can have a quick joint of but it&#039;s not always convenient to test acid and molly at 11am when the post man comes. Sometimes, but not always!

				it doesn&#039;t mean you have to leave a review, you can finalize when you have the gear, and wait on leaving the feedback until you have done enough of it to leave good feedback.&nbsp; As DPR states any feedback you have yet to leave will be on the vendor&#039;s page when you visit it.

				it happens many times, that customers who are unhappy with waiting time or anything else, they instantly leave a bad review instead of messaging the vendor. then after messaging, they mostly appologize for the bad rating and do something more senseful.<br /><br />so in this cases, when a customer leaves a &quot;emotional&quot; 1/5, he has no option to change it to a better rating later?<br /><br />I would really appreciate if it would be possible for the customer to have to option to &quot;improve&quot; a rating later. <br />(i&#039;m ok with blocking later bad feedbacks, of course)<br /><br />much love from a 100% guy.

				Yes i totally i agree with a lot of the issues with FE. FE is a total scam, and too many people are being victimized by it. DRP you need to throw that on the list of all things you wish to update for the better. This gets out of hands, maybe you should make the Vendor bond 1,500 or PLUS.. anyone cant put together $500.. Thus making these scams very real!<br /><br />-420

				YAY! Locked in feedback, I&#039;m hard.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t finalize until you test guys, for things like MDMA keep a test kit handy.&nbsp; If you are sketched out at all and you think the product is fake/cut/analog/short/intercepted etc. that is what res. center should be for. <br />

				This would be great if ratings were for the PRODUCT ONLY, not for both product and vendor.&nbsp; You see, many buyers only rate vendor performance, not product quality. or vice-versa.&nbsp; We need ratings to be SEPARATED!!&nbsp; Each purchase gets TWO ratings, one for VENDOR PERFORMANCE. one for PRODUCT QUALITY.<br /><br />Are you listening, DPR?

				I think this is an improvement, most good buyers contact a vendor before leaving a bad review anyways. I see the problem with the bad buyers impulsively leaving 1/5 or trying to blackmail a vendor, maybe the buyer ratings could eliminate all feedback from a certain buyer if their score drops too low. Or if a buyer is inactive for a long period of time (not logging on at all) all of their reviews disappear. So buyers who create new accounts after getting a bad rating will have their old accounts become harmless.<br /><br />It&#039;s a step in the right direction, I&#039;m more excited to see what the system to rate buyers will be.

				This is awesome.&nbsp; So long as there is something bold to clarify the finalize/feedback process effectively:<br />Make it obvious that &quot;finalizing&quot; is marking the package as received and &quot;feedback&quot; should ONLY be left after trying the produce and giving the vendor the opportunity to respond to any issues.&nbsp; Simple bold notes to this effect at various points on the site should handle most of the &quot;quick emotional feedback&quot; qualms.<br /><br />Maybe have a separate deadlines for feedback on the buyer&#039;s side too?&nbsp; This would make it more obvious that releasing escrow (&quot;finalizing&quot;) and leaving feedback are separate acts.&nbsp; Many people seem to miss, that this has always been the case.&nbsp; Since we are adopting a system enforces this distinction more (by making feedback permanent, and so removing the &quot;feedback later&quot; aspect), it is important to make this very patent and clear to buyers.<br /><br />It could also use an ebay-like system where high volume vendors can request a re-review for a few items per (year?, month? not sure what typical vendor profile life expectancy is).<br /><br />Overall... awesome.<br /><br />Just hope the site comes back up soon.

				Yeah, this thread will open a lot of eyes and be HUGE!&nbsp; Look at ratings on The Shroomery (www.shroomery.org) for example... &quot;User ratings&quot; in one set, &quot;Trade ratings&quot; for the user are separate.&nbsp; A hated user in the forums can be a trustworthy trader, and a liked user can be a flakey trader or vice-versa.<br /><br />Same goes for PRODUCT QUALITY and VENDOR RELIANCE. <br /><br />This site could learn a lot from that site.<br /><br />DPR, are you listening?

				Agreed, three days ago We were left a 1/5 with the word Scammer on feedback for our opium listing.&nbsp; The buyer finalized on day 14 without striking up any dialogue or going to resolution...

				I&#039;ve left numerous positive reviews after finalizing and the review is never shown. Hopefully that&#039;s fixed.&nbsp; Seems like transaction stats don&#039;t really mean a whole lot since Digital and Lotta ticket purchases are included in the transaction history.

Ive only been a vendor for two months and had &#039;emotional feedback&#039; left only to be changed later. One client said my product was shitty then later apologized saying he didnt actually try it first and it turned out to be amazing. He changed his feedback and everyone was happy. Now what? That bad score will be permanent? That means my perfect score will be completely in the hands of the buyer. Im not on board with this. Having the ability to work with an unsatisfied customer and get that 5/5 is important. Also im sure if a crap score is left than alot of buyers might find vendors not giving a shit about helping them with a resolution because the feedback cant change. There would be no incentive and thats all bad.

Let me share a recent story.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been stocking some of the best ketamine that I ever have had my hands on.&nbsp; The ketamine crowd, for me at least, is very picky... hard to please. They will often straight up interrogate me before ordering and they love to test you gear via reagents all the time. They are straight up connoisseurs. That being said, I do exceptionally well with them.<br /><br />So. &quot;Chad&quot; orders a gram of my ket. He leaves a 2/5 review saying how fast the delivery was and the stealth was great. The product was very disappointing though..... So I get to the bottom of this.. Chad has never done ketamine before. Didn&#039;t know how to weight it out, doesn&#039;t have a drug scale, does not know what a reagent test is, and he is eating the ketamine and redosing every 1.5 hours by eating more ketamine. For some reason.... he couldn&#039;t reach the k-hole before having an upset stomach....<br /><br />Tell me what I did wrong here. I sent out awesome product. My stealth is great, and I nailed his first class delivery with the right speed. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to chalk this up to his noobery. I&#039;m not too happy about that.... but it&#039;s okay. I had a discussion with him. I wanted to set him well on his way to meeting his spirit journey goals by giving him good information and accommodating in a different way.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t even talk to this noob if i was locked at a 2/5 rating. <br />

				I&#039;m not sure I understand the problem removing the ability to edit feedback is intended to solve; DPR, can you go into a little more detail behind your motivation for this change? Best I could come up with was the potential for abuse with the system as it was, where a buyer with many transactions with a particular vendor could then extort the vendor, threatening to change all the previous orders to 1 if the vendor doesn&#039;t comply with demands. <br /><br />If you wont reconsider this change, perhaps you could add a set amount of time where feedback can be changed after it was left, after which it can no longer be edited. This would allow users to fix typos, or to edit with new information if the situation has changed.

				PROPOSED SOLUTION to the problems listed in this page: permit the customer to amend their most recent review of any particular Vendor only.<br /><br />So a Scammer / Rival Vendor can&#039;t go through pages of listings changing things to 1/5, but will still have the ability to change a recent review - be it to improve (because the Vendor has reassured them) or to drop it (after testing the gear was weak/bad, etc.).

If the buyer came back, obviously they were happy with the previous transaction and consider it closed.

They will often straight up interrogate me before ordering and they love to test you gear via reagents all the time. They are straight up connoisseurs. That being said, I do exceptionally well with them.<br /><br />So. &quot;Chad&quot; orders a gram of my ket. He leaves a 2/5 review saying how fast the delivery was and the stealth was great. The product was very disappointing though..... So I get to the bottom of this.. Chad has never done ketamine before. Didn&#039;t know how to weight it out, doesn&#039;t have a drug scale, does not know what a reagent test is, and he is eating the ketamine and redosing every 1.5 hours by eating more ketamine. For some reason.... he couldn&#039;t reach the k-hole before having an upset stomach....<br /><br />Tell me what I did wrong here. I sent out awesome product. My stealth is great, and I nailed his first class delivery with the right speed. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to chalk this up to his noobery. I&#039;m not too happy about that.... but it&#039;s okay. I had a discussion with him. I wanted to set him well on his way to meeting his spirit journey goals by giving him good information and accommodating in a different way.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t even talk to this noob if i was locked at a 2/5 rating.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good point, but far from the &quot;norm&quot; in transactions, however, an easy solution would be to be able to mark this transaction as &quot;out of norm&quot;, for which you are allowed 2 per month, or some such limit, and does not apply to your overall rating.

				Hi DPR,<br /><br />The only major issue I have noticed after the immediate update is I can no longer access &#039;View feedback&#039; from my vendor profile under &#039;Account&#039; settings. I feel this option is still important as it seems the only means a vendor has to easily identify which buyers left which feedback.<br /><br />Also, I think everyone should give the &#039;locked feedback&#039; option a chance. <br />[[Proposed Improvement]]<br />Maybe provide a function for vendors to see a customers &#039;Average feedback for other vendors&#039; score when purchasing so vendors can better assess which customers they would like to do business with. This way, it&#039;ll really make a customer think more seriously about the feedback score they are willing to leave and only want to leave negative ratings for real issues or concerns. <br /><br />If a customer is constantly leaving an average of 3 or less feedback over many transactions, it allows the vendor to see maybe the customer is either really unlucky in his/her purchases, or the customer is just unable to adequately follow vendor profiles/continues to make poor decisions when ordering or receiving packages. A vendor would want to stay away from this type of customer even for security reasons alone. Then a customer with an average feedback score of 3.5+ over many transactions, will likely be more trusted as an intelligible buyer/customer who is capable of taking the right precautions when ordering and is capable of following the advice listed in vendor profiles.<br /><br />Of course another system allowing vendors to rate their customers would work similarly to this as well, but what I proposed above could be more of a temporary solution since it seems it would be less complex to implement.

				The fact that buyers can&#039;t change their bad rating of a vendor to a good rating will certainly change the dynamics.&nbsp; Once poor feedback is left the vendor has much less incentive to work things out with that buyer.&nbsp; Hopefully the feedback page will at least say &quot;this is final and cannot be changed.&quot;<br /><br />Vendors with perfect scores will now become a thing of the past and I think that&#039;s actually a good thing.&nbsp; Vendors with 100% 5/5 feedback were just asking to get scammed by extortionists.

				I was fine with the system before, the new feedback system bulks up the page too much and only fits 5 feedbacks. If it were me leave the old layout just give vendors the chance to rate buyers.

				People what the hell does changing feedback have to do with scammers? They can still extort you even if feedback is permanent. The only difference now that feedback is permanent is that hot headed buyers might go off and permanently screw over a vendor and DPR has stated that he may allow feedback to be changed only if its higher.<br /><br />Feedback is buyers power and some buyers are gonna abuse it, Shipping is vendors power and some vendors are gonna abuse it. Theres nothing DPR can do to change that except provide more transparency. At least if feedback is a one-shot deal then vendors dont have to worry about competitors/trolls stealth 1&#039;ing them later on when they&#039;re not looking.<br /><br /><br />

Newbie buyer leaving bad feedback doesn&#039;t mean as much as an established buyer leaving bad feedback. <br /><br />If a buyer is afraid of being selectively scammed, the buyer can look at negative feedback and see if only low stat buyers are getting the shaft and then they will know not to FE. <br /><br />DPR&#039;s new system is full of meta data that both new and savvy buyers can use to their advantage. <br /><br />Study it some more when the site is up and you&#039;ll see that it&#039;s a very good system. <br /><br />I&#039;m confident that the weaknesses can be addressed by SR staff. Especially now that feedback is permanent, I&#039;m sure DPR will have some sort of feedback grievance division which will allow buyers and vendors to adjust/remove unwarranted feedback upon reviewing some sort of evidence. But bad feedback doesn&#039;t have as much damaging weight as it once did. So the angst about being left bad feedback should wane a bit. And as vendors see how the new system works, they will make adjustments accordingly. <br /><br />So let&#039;s all give it a least a week, take notes and we&#039;ll compare notes and see what if anything we all might suggest that needs a tweak here or there.

				I&#039;m back in.<br />Not sure how I feel (as a buyer) about not being able to change (or even see) my feedback. I always leave 5/5 unless there&#039;s an issue that can&#039;t be resolved, but that doesn&#039;t mean the textual part is always top-notch. Sometimes when I read it back, I realize it could be interpreted in a mean way and/or is unfair to the vendor. So in that case I change it.<br />How about we&#039;re still able to change the text, just not the rating? And/or be able to change the (full) review within the next 48 hours? That way sellers have at least a chance to deal with emotional feedback, without risking a vendor lining up orders and then all of a sudden change them to a 1/5.

				The danger of destroying things in the name of making them better is a constant worry -- this is well known to anyone who has dealt with the American &amp; Australian tax codes (particularly, in the latter case, since 2007).&nbsp; I have thought SR&#039;s review system works great; could it be better?&nbsp; Why not, but don&#039;t burn the return ticket until the new system has shown its worth.<br /><br />There will be flaws to any system, of course, and any system will have loopholes that can be discovered if someone is taking the time to discover them.<br /><br />I have to say that, so far, it doesn&#039;t look like the &quot;discussion&quot; boards attached to vendors/listings in the last upgrade are being used -- at least, I cannot see much activity right there (not yet, anyway).&nbsp; <br /><br />On the upside, if the forums are being made somewhat redundant by the on-site review system, does this mean that the (onerous, but not clearly avoidable) 50 post limit for newbies is going to be revised?&nbsp; If reviews are on-site and the on-site bot avoidance is OK, can this hurdle be taken down?&nbsp; I have often thought it a necessary evil that should be disposed of as quickly as wise.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I welcome and appreciate change, as well as some of these recent feedback/review reworkings. However, making the feedback and once and only, permanent thing is imho a poor decision. Futhermore, I truly feel that this and some other recent changes have/will/do only benefit the vendors while leaving buyers more exposed to scamming (be it selective or outright). I have been getting the feeling that the new DPR and SR as a whole (as an organization)&nbsp; are tipping the scales and are siding more with vendors (even scamming vendors) just to get their commission cut with little regard to the buyers. I realize that without good vendors and products this site is worthless, but what about the buyers? Particularly new, naive ones that are unsure about how the whole process works. Finally, two of my relevant contributions to the new &#039;discuss&#039; platform were removed seemingly by SR admins with zero explanation. I was civil and polite, although they may have been deemed &quot;inflammatory.&quot; But who exactly gets to decide this? Do you guys (admins) just consider anything the vendor doesn&#039;t like as &quot;inflammatory.&quot; Because that was/is the impression I am getting. And to clarify, both comments were to explain what I truly believed to be selective scam attmepts. One vendor has been recently exposed but has benefited from the &quot;do-over&quot; that the new removal of the 100 rating creates. The other was a top vendor who claims to not sell adulterated product but from my own orders, and the comments of others, it seems very clear that the vendor in question does &quot;play some games&quot; with buyers. Please help me feel like I am not being disregarded as a buyer in favor of vendors. With the money I am pumping into this site regularly (close to 20k in less than a year, I know that&#039;s not that much really, but it ain&#039;t nothing) I want to feel like I have a voice, as quiet as it may be.

				I absolutely hate this new feedback. It takes up WAY too much blank space and leaves the page very cluttered. <br /><br />I also do not like as a vendor that I can no longer see who left me the bad review. Where is the &quot;view feedback&quot; button? I can no longer blacklist my competition&#039;s aliases who are just going to leave bad reviews for biz reasons???? That&#039;s unacceptable.

				This will take some getting used to but I see some good things about the new feedback system.&nbsp; I also see some things that might need changed.&nbsp; Some of you have already pointed out what I&#039;m about to say.&nbsp; What I do like is the fact that you can still sort by time or &quot;freshness&quot; as it&#039;s called to view feedback in the same order that was used to.&nbsp; It&#039;s also nice to easily see which item the person bought without having to hover your mouse over top &quot;item&quot; like you used to.&nbsp; On the down side though not being able to edit reviews is a drag.&nbsp; For one vendor that I deal with a lot I always FE and write &quot;FE will update later&quot; and then I provide an update once I receive the item.&nbsp; Or just the other day I had to run out the door so I finalized and wrote something like &quot;Will update later when I have more time but finalizing&quot; and then later I&#039;d go back and write up the review (yes I&#039;m actually one of the buyers who goes back and updates lol).&nbsp; See it doesn&#039;t matter to me the buyer when I finalize and write the reviews but it does matter to the vendor.&nbsp; A lot of them say stuff like finalize within 24 hours of receiving or I&#039;ll black list you or not do business again with you.&nbsp; But what if we need more time to try the product and just want to release coins at that point?&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh and one more positive I wanted to mention.&nbsp; I REALLY like how it groups all the 5 out of 5 reviews together and then 4 out of 5 and 3 out of 5 and so on.&nbsp; Because as a buyer I&#039;m most curious about seeing what the bad reviews have been.&nbsp; I won&#039;t sit and read 5 out of 5 reviews all day because a lot of them are cookie cutter and nothing but good stuff.&nbsp; There is some information to be gathered amongst the 5 out of 5&#039;s, but there&#039;s def. important information in the 4 out of 5 all the way down to the 1 out of 5 reviews.&nbsp; As a buyer I really want to see what caused another buyer to rate less than a 5 out of 5.&nbsp; Those reviews are most important to me in my decision to use a vendor.&nbsp; For example, I was going to order green from one vendor until I read a bad review saying something like &quot;opened up the mailbox and I got hit with a huge wiff of weed.&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;m extra cautious so that was enough to steer me away.&nbsp; Before I had to dig for that information and now I don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; So thank you!

I can see that the changes he&#039;s making were pretty well thought out and must have been in the works for a while. So my trust and faith in DPR is as strong as ever. And I can&#039;t think of a time when he&#039;s either dropped the ball or let us down. He&#039;s a brilliant, well reasoned and forward thinking dude (or dudette). <br /><br />Long live SR.

				BTW everyone, <br /><br />Atlantis has a permanent feedback system as well and it has worked out well so far. <br /><br />In fact, I was reading about a vendor who was in a dispute with a buyer. The buyer lost the dispute because he failed to prove whatever it was he claimed. So of course a person who loses a dispute would leave negative feedback. And so they did. <br /><br />But get this...<br /><br />The vendor contacted Atlantis admins and got the 1 star feedback removed. And that makes sense since the buyer failed to prove his claim and lost the dispute. The buyer shouldn&#039;t be able to leave feedback. <br /><br />Seeing how reasonable DPR is, I&#039;m confident that DPR would implement a similar policy that if buyer loses a resolution case, they can&#039;t leave feedback or in the case of a partial refund, can only leave feedback that is commensurate with the amount of refund. So say the buyer gets a partial refund of 50% to 75%. Then they can only leave a 3/5 or 4/5 of higher, respectively.&nbsp; Or if they only get a 25% refund, then they can only leave a minimum of 2/5 or higher. Or something like that. <br /><br />Point is, have faith that DPR will work things out fairly for both sides of the bitcoin.<br /><br />Exciting times ahead for SR.

				So basically I&#039;m just reiterating what others have criticized so far.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t like the look of the new feedback layout, it is clunky and clumsy looking and only fits 4-5 reviews on the front page before having to &quot;click to see more.&quot;&nbsp; I don&#039;t really care all that much about other buyer&#039;s stats when reading feedback and this is information about someone that really, I feel, only vendors should be able to see, not the entire site.&nbsp; I realize that your alias is hidden, but it could still be used to determine a history of ordering by crawling through feedback and seeing all the ones left that have X orders for X amount with X vendors at X account age at a given moment.&nbsp; Yes, I realize this doesn&#039;t necessarily give an identity, but it&#039;s still loose information.<br /><br />While I think the few feedback sorting options implemented are a nice start, I do not like when I sort feedback by &quot;freshness&quot; that it still segregates them by score.&nbsp; When I&#039;m looking at recent feedback, it&#039;s to get a snapshot of the vendors recent activity to see if they have had a lot of positive or negative feedback.&nbsp; Now I have to glance at every single segregated section, look at the dates and try and line them up in my mind.&nbsp; It was much easier to do this before with just being able to see the most recent feedbacks on the front page grouped together regardless of score.&nbsp; Now with only being able to see 4-5 reviews on the front page, it&#039;s much more work for a buyer to determine if a vendor has had recent problems.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m also concerned about not being able to view feedback I&#039;ve already left, as it helps me remember which vendors I liked and which I didn&#039;t.&nbsp; Though I&#039;m not a vendor, I feel concern for them as well with the locked feedback system.&nbsp; It puts them in a difficult situation dealing with immature, rude or just scammer buyers who are going to leave impulsive feedback and then not able to change it.&nbsp; What incentive is a vendor going to have for trying to correct a situation if the feedback can&#039;t be adjusted to reflect that they worked it out?&nbsp; I read the thread and see it&#039;s being considered to change it so you can increase feedback but not lower it.&nbsp; Ok, so then when buyers are asked to FE, I think it will be the natural impulse to FE leaving a 1/5 feedback in case the transaction turns out to be a disaster, knowing that you can always raise it up to a 5/5 later if things work out.&nbsp; Certainly wouldn&#039;t leave a 5/5 when FE&#039;ing knowing that I couldn&#039;t lower it if things turned bad.&nbsp; Are vendors really going to be ok with this trend?&nbsp; What buyer is actually going to a FE with a 5/5 under this new system?<br /><br />Ok, those are just my intitial thoughts after reading through the thread.&nbsp; Sure I&#039;ll think of other things and may add them later.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				These new changes have a high potential of becoming a major security risk. <br /><br />If our community was based around the legal distribution of lets say, idk..baseball hats, this would be a great new system. Unfortunately, that is not the case. We can only hope for the best i suppose.

				The new features are great, my only concern is maybe buyers won&#039;t know right away how to leave a review, I&#039;ve already had a buyer message me asking&nbsp; where he could leave one. I&#039;m sure after a few weeks everyone will catch on though

				Ideas: <br /><br />1) When scrolling through reviews on a vendor page, for example, 5/5 review section, you may click on the next page (1, 2, &quot;3&quot; .. last), but when you scroll it a bit too far to those 4/5 or 3/5 rating pages, and you overlook or accidentally click on the next page(1 ,&quot;2&quot;, 3 .. last), then the whole page refreshes.. This rests the page number on the previous section back to (&quot;1&quot;, 2, 3 .. last). This is frustrating.<br /><br />We should be able to be on different pages (within a tab) for each 5/5, 4/5, ect. review section at the same time without resting the previous ones you were on, before.<br /><br />2) Review section should include where mails were sent to, as this is more relevant for a buyer to know rather than what other people&#039;s buy stats are.. It can&#039;t help if 100 Australian buyers rate 1/5 on a vendor for non arrivals, if there is 100% success within Europe.<br /><br />I hope people get what i am going at :) Thank you OP

				This feedback system opens up buyers to a variety of new attacks.<br /><br />Someone scraping the site will be able to reconstruct buyer purchase histories. Imagine a pseudonymous buyer with 10 purchases and $500 spent. A few days later there&#039;s a review on a $50 product from someone with 11 purchases and $550 spent. A week later on a product that costs $125 there&#039;s a review from someone with 12 purchases and $675 spent. User age (conveniently specified to the day) will further confirm this is the same person.<br /><br />So what? You say. Nobody knows who it is. Then the attacker turns to the forum and looks for reviews on those products, during the same time periods. Stylometry (the use of specific adjectives, punctuation, etc.) will help link the forum user to the pseudonymous buyer. The attacker can employ a variety of social engineering tactics, now that he has a target with a verifiable purchasing history. He befriends the target, tells him he wants to start vending &lt;target&#039;s favorite drug&gt; and would like to test the waters with a custom listing for the target. Now he has an address that can be physically linked to the target.<br /><br />If you have high stats, you should not be participating in this. If you have $50,000 in purchases over a year and you think LE doesn&#039;t care about you because you are a &quot;buyer&quot; and not a &quot;vendor&quot;, you will eventually find yourself inside a jail cell.<br /><br />It&#039;s unfortunate, because someone in the SR administration once told me that &quot;obscurity is security&quot;. They seem to have forgotten that.<br /><br /><br />

				I see another issue with the change that I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s brought up yet.<br /><br />Right now, when I click &quot;Vendor reviews: Click here for more&quot; on a certain top 4% vendor&#039;s page, I get a page that shows:<br /><br />five 5/5 reviews<br />one 4/5 review<br />one 3/5 review<br />two 2/5 reviews<br />three 1/5 reviews<br /><br />That&#039;s five positive reviews (5/5 rating) and seven negative reviews (4/5 rating or below) on the page, regardless of whether you sort by weight or freshness.<br /><br />Now, keep in mind that this vendor has, after rounding, 100% positive feedback (5 stars); ratings of 4/5 or less are so rare that they register as 0%. But when skimming the front review page, one gets the impression that this vendor is a scam artist at best (&quot;what as SCAM. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS DUDE.&quot;) and a biological terrorist at worst (&quot;Horrible Roll Disgusting Product 7 Hours of throwing up blood. Thanks. Assholes&quot;).<br /><br />I appreciate the attempt at transparency in making negative reviews more easily accessible, but I think they&#039;re given too much prominence in this case. I shouldn&#039;t be confronted with every negative review ever written for a vendor when I go to their review page- I should have to dig a bit more. A good compromise might be to make the vendor rating breakdown in the upper right hand corner clickable- something like what Amazon does. That way you can still easily access negative reviews, but you&#039;re never given the psychological impression that a vendor with a 100% positive feedback rating has as many negative reviews as positive.<br /><br />Just my .02 BTC. I appreciate all the hard work you put into this site, DPR.

				As a vendor how am I supposed to reach out to a customer who leaves a 1/5 review to see if the situation can be fixed of I dont know who they are? and for that matter how is a customer going to change their feedback if a misunderstanding causes them to leave a 1/5 and the vendor fixes the original issue. <br /><br />I need a feedback page that lists them in the order received and who gave them. just a page on my account list by no means should that info be public I agree but taking that info from us is a HUGE CUSTOMER SERVICE NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!

Problem with the order? Take it to the resolution center, they will solve your problem, and you won&#039;t leave feedback. No more buyers finalizing leaving a &quot;fucking vendor shorted me by a half!&quot; then the vendor being forced to send 2x the original for the buyer to change&nbsp; his feedback. I&#039;m sick of this shit where being able to edit feedback is a tool used by scammers. Just ask the vendor GOLD what he thinks about buyers being able to change feedback.<br />

Don&#039;t be a dickhead.<br /><br />DPR.<br /><br />Would it be possible to change the amount spent and purchases to a range?<br /><br />For example, a buyers who has spent $175 could have stats that show &quot;around $200.&quot; Buyer with with 9125 could show as &quot; around 9100.&quot;<br /><br />Same thing with number or purchases and everything else able to be identified. <br /><br />Round all the numbers?

				I am still not entirely sure how the new system will work and what information will be open to the public, but I agree with the security concerns of others here.&nbsp; Lets not forget that there are a lot of people that get paid huge sums of our tax money to stalk us, find us, and lock us in a cage for engaging in these voluntary transactions.&nbsp; I really hope the new system will be as secure if not more secure and private than the old system.

Imagine a pseudonymous buyer with 10 purchases and $500 spent. A few days later there&#039;s a review on a $50 product from someone with 11 purchases and $550 spent. A week later on a product that costs $125 there&#039;s a review from someone with 12 purchases and $675 spent. User age (conveniently specified to the day) will further confirm this is the same person.<br /><br />So what? You say. Nobody knows who it is. Then the attacker turns to the forum and looks for reviews on those products, during the same time periods. Stylometry (the use of specific adjectives, punctuation, etc.) will help link the forum user to the pseudonymous buyer. The attacker can employ a variety of social engineering tactics, now that he has a target with a verifiable purchasing history. He befriends the target, tells him he wants to start vending &lt;target&#039;s favorite drug&gt; and would like to test the waters with a custom listing for the target. Now he has an address that can be physically linked to the target.<br /><br />If you have high stats, you should not be participating in this. If you have $50,000 in purchases over a year and you think LE doesn&#039;t care about you because you are a &quot;buyer&quot; and not a &quot;vendor&quot;, you will eventually find yourself inside a jail cell.<br /><br />It&#039;s unfortunate, because someone in the SR administration once told me that &quot;obscurity is security&quot;. They seem to have forgotten that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have to agree with astor. Some great points made. Too much information is now publicly available for all to see. Out of sight, out of mind. +1&nbsp; :)

If you do that, this update will be for nothing. Everyone here who claims this puts buyers at risk has yet to describe one actual scenario where it really would. Let people be pissed off, who cares? SR has a serious problem, this is a very good fix, and until someone can provide why this is a security risk over the old way, leave it and let them move to alantis. <br /><br />The only people that should be pissed off about this update is scammers and vendors who leave fake feedback.

				The old adage, &quot;if it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it&quot; certainly applies here.&nbsp; I thought the old system was fine.&nbsp; The new system gives names and stats if you leave a review and under those circumstances, I won&#039;t be leaving any reviews.&nbsp; I am sure I am not alone.&nbsp; And to lose what may be a very large number of reviews will be a real loss to the system.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would really suggest re-thinking this.

If you do that, this update will be for nothing. Everyone here who claims this puts buyers at risk has yet to describe one actual scenario where it really would. Let people be pissed off, who cares? SR has a serious problem, this is a very good fix, and until someone can provide why this is a security risk over the old way, leave it and let them move to alantis. <br /><br />The only people that should be pissed off about this update is scammers and vendors who leave fake feedback.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I will give this a shot, I think it might be possible that this update would put buyers and sellers all across the road at higher risk.&nbsp; Im not sure about how the entire new system will work yet, but I am assuming that the buyer stats are public meaning anyone can see the amount of money buyers have spent and the number of vendors they have purchased from and the amount of orders they have made.<br /><br />I see this as a risk for buyers who choose to allow their stats to be viewable, which then puts sellers and the whole community at higher risk.&nbsp; Law enforcement could go through all the feedback and correlate certain buyers and their stats with the vendors they order from and it may be even possible to get the date they ordered that item.&nbsp; Then if law enforcement ever intercepts a package or even orders from a vendor, a lot of vendors use the same return address multiple times.&nbsp; As far as I know it has come out recently that every piece of mail in the USPS system is photographed and the information put into a database.&nbsp; So once they get a vendors return address they can just go look back into the system and start investigating others who received mail from that address.&nbsp; As they get more intel this job gets easier.&nbsp; Using the information from this update they could possibly setup more sophisticated attacks and use the information to identify more buyers, more vendor return addresses, and intercept more packages.<br /><br />Anyways I could be wrong because I don&#039;t totally understand the new system yet, but maybe its food for thought.<br /><br />

I like to &#039;stalk&#039; a vendors page for a few days before I make a purchase strictly to view the new feedback. Once I have placed an order I come back to the page to check the new feedback of the vendor. I also like to look at &#039;all&#039; the feedback to get a rough estimate of how many packages get through, quality of the product etc. People having the choice to not leave any feedback at all (I assume most are going to do this if the do receive the order) is just going to make it harder to gauge a vendors ability in different areas whether it be quality, shipping speed and amount of lost packages.<br /><br />If anything I would prefer to see the feedback of newer buyers over the long time, big spenders...A vendor has a much bigger incentive to &#039;look after&#039; the big spenders than the little guys if looking at it from a business stand point. The little guys are the ones that will shows a vendors true professionalism when it comes to their store...

				The new vendor feedback system is a bit irritating and I feel it is too detailed about the buyer stats. Things like &quot;Member for: 1+/6+ months/1 year...&quot;, &quot;Money spent: 100+/$1000+/10000+&quot; would be sufficient.<br /><br />Feedback on item pages is still untouched, what I feel it needs (and nothing more): Show more feedback per page and let me sort it by rating.

				The new feedback seems a little confusing and I think I found a bug.<br /><br />Anyway, when doing a review are we reviewing the vendor or the product? I just left a review and it is only visible on the vendors page and not on the product page. <br /><br />Also, after I left a review I am no longer able to view other reviews, just my own. Now if I click the different products I am able to see others reviews and they look like the old system. This makes things a little confusing and takes away the symmetry. The feedback on the product pages and vendor page should look similar.<br /><br />Actually, never mind I read about how you changed things. <br /><br />However, I have a new suggestion. Could you implement a system to determine success rate for international orders? I was thinking you could include a new button or option when leaving feedback that asks whether or not a product was received. This data is used to calculate a percentage ( so too many details are revealed ). Then when a buyer views a vendors page ( or you can show this on the specific product ) they can view the percentage of orders that successfully made it to their country. This would be very helpful in choosing a vendor because some countries have stricter customs.

				It&#039;s very sad that there are so many people against this.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been around sr for about a year now and I definitely find the new feedback system an IMPROVEMENT.<br /><br />yes, it&#039;s good to be paranoid while doing something like this (ordering drugs over the internet)<br /><br />IDK, I&#039;m staying anonymous but I dont think I should refrain from reviewing because with my stats I would be the kind of person a noob would trust (in the case of reading reviews to know whether or not the product was legit)<br /><br />I personally love the fact that we can sort through different scores of feedback and we can know what day it was from!<br /><br />I&#039;ve made a purchase or two and it allowed me to trust a vendor that I probably wouldn&#039;t have. (not a perfect rating, but for the last month or so they have been doing perfect!)<br /><br />shit like that makes it obvious that its an improvement for both buyers and sellers.<br /><br />It helps us know who to trust.<br /><br />We can all stay anonymous through this am I right?

				I agreee with atlas the review system is nice and everything but being unable to change feedback is going to cause problems. I dont want to wait two weeks to go to resolution to sort a problem, when i can leave a low raiting and the vendor will jump through hoops to find a solution that earns a 5/5

				DPR,<br /><br />If I understand this correctly, the reviews at this moment appear to be listed in some sort of Weighted Order (as i Don&#039;t see my review I left saturday morning regarding a 1kg custom order).&nbsp; If this is the case, Can we still have the option to list reviews by Date if we choose, I find it&#039;s a great way to see new trends in vendor feedback.<br /><br />For instance, I recently made a big purchase of some hash, only to see 3 reviews for the same product come up over the following week that the particular hash that was being shipped was not the hash that was advertised.&nbsp; And sure enough, now that it finally arrived it was definitely not as advertised. (but in this case was still very nice hash 5/5).<br /><br />If the reviews are listed in a weighted fashion, trends like the above would take longer to pick up on.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				To all those complaining about not being able to change FE reviews. Don&#039;t leave review until you get the item.<br /><br />Sorry, but the SR system is not built or maintained for FE. Use escrow no problems. Looks like this is trying to discourage FE if anything.<br /><br />Good job DPR and crew!

				It looks like it will be a while before the new system settles down and can be properly evaluated. Until then I will be wary of ordering items I have not already tried, or buying from vendors I haven&#039;t already bought from.<br /><br />Previously I finalised and left an initial review on delivery/stealth as soon as the goods arrived, and then revised the review after trying the product, which in the case of psychedelics might be a month or more later. Many others do the same, except not all of them return to update their reviews. If buyers wait until they have tried out the product before leaving a review it&#039;s likely that there will be far fewer reviews, especially for those items which are only available for a limited period. Therefore I agree with previous posters that it would be helpful to have separate reviews and/or ratings for delivery/stealth and product quality to try and ensure there will be at least some current feeedback available on the vendor.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				its looking ok, but it needs work, a couple of issues ive found;<br /><br />1) shows feedback for items that were in stealth, custom listings are kept in stealth for privacy reasons etc, they shoudlnt come out in the feedback.<br /><br />2) very hard to determine feedback for a specific item, so customer cant judge quality of a certain product before he buys.<br /><br />both important issues not to be overlooked duing the upgrade.<br /><br />

What do you think then, if this has been worked out from mathmatical equations has he over looked the potential breach of security? why don&#039;t you PM him and tell him what you&#039;ve found?

				Thank you for addressing my concerns DPR,<br /><br />I have since changed my alias.&nbsp; I would like it if us buyers had the option to hide our stats in our feedbacks and discussion posts.&nbsp; I still will not be leaving feedbacks as long as my buyer stats are made public.&nbsp; Even fake aliases give LE more power to start drawing up maps and shit, they could see every feedback you&#039;ve left the same alias and around what time you left it.&nbsp; Really sketches me out.

				o_O Just logged in today to see this...this...monster of a review system! It is not user friendly when comparing it to the old system at all.<br /><br />And considering new customers to SR, this is not going to be easy to understand at all...Its quite a turn off.<br /><br />We used to be able to click a vendor and on the Vendors main page get a general idea of what that vendor is like...Now everyone has to navigate through this new clunky menu with gigantic boxes, click through several pages and it is a real pain in the ass with how slow Tor is...<br /><br />In saying that I still appreciate the work you are putting in DPR, but this feedback system just makes it a chore to browse through vendors.

				Is ANYONE getting feedback now with the new system?<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed what others have mentioned. Buyers aren&#039;t leaving reviews anymore. I understood the need to change to weighted ratings, however it seems people now prefer &#039;opting-out&#039; since given the option to.

				Oh yeah, I third option for wanting an alias is to change your name on each review so someone can&#039;t reconstruct your purchasing history by scraping the site and searching for your name. First of all, I bet 90% of buyers won&#039;t change their alias from review to review, but even if the do, their stats will allow an adversary to rebuild their purchasing history with relative ease, as I&#039;ve already outlined:<br /><br />They find a reviewer with 12 purchases and $675 spent on a $125 item. So they search for reviews at earlier time points from someone with 12 - 1 = 11 purchases and $675 - $125 = $550 spent. When they find a candidate, they can confirm it by the account age, because the second review came N days before the first one, and the account is N days younger (if they stamp the review with the account age at the time it was made, and not the current account age, in which case it would be even easier since they would be direct matches). The second review is on a $50 item, so they look for a review with 11 - 1 = 10 purchases and $550 - $50 = $500 spent. Rinse and repeat. There might be some false positives and a little difficulty because of the slightly floating cost of items due to the exchange rate and not hedging, but it won&#039;t be too hard. The buyer age will usually be sufficient to get the right person.<br /><br />So again, the alias simply fails at everything it is intended to do.

				Didn&#039;t sign on for a day or two and came back to this mess.<br /><br />Other issues aside, the review boxes are now MASSIVE. I can only see like 5 on a page and at the rate tor loads pages, it will take me forever to read enough to get a good picture.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure my other grievances have been voiced in these 22 pages. Hopefully something good comes out of the discussion.
