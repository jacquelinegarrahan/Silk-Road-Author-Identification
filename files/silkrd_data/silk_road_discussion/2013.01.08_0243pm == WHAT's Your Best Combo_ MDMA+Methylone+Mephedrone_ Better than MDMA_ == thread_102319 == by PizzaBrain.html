				MDMA+Methylone?&nbsp; MDMA+Meph?&nbsp; Meph+Methylone? +MDMA?<br /><br />I was wondering if any drug combination you&#039;ve found to prolong or heighten the euphoric and empathetic aspect of ecstasy?<br />It wouldn&#039;t have to include MDMA but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if you could get the same effect with Methylone and Mephedrone in combination.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never taken Meph orally, only via insufflation which is shite, very little euphoria this way and anxious stimulation. <br />I&#039;ve not done Methylone.<br /><br />I once heard combining a tiny amount of a drug such as 5-MeO-DiPT along with MDMA or 2C-B or 2C-E is greatly synergistic and the euphoria is extreme. <br />I don&#039;t have time to search this one because the user reported that he peaked, and then kept peaking higher and higher to the point where he felt like he was going to seize. but there are many other known combinations of drugs.<br /><br />I really liked CandyFlipping. next time I&#039;ll probably try a LiquidE-flip (GHB+acid) if theres not too many bad reports, I find G incredibly euphoric and sensual. and kicks in within 10 minutes. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interested, don&#039;t bother with GBL, It&#039;s disgusting and dries your body out. GHB the other hand was sold in health shops in the 80&#039;s and used to increase Human Growth Hormone for the purposes of fat metabolism, muscle growth and increases feeling of wellbeing. It&#039;s already produced by the body and has a positive energetic afterglow rather than a comedown. <br />- This is why i&#039;d probably prefer it to E when mixed with acid, as the comedown tend&#039;s to ruin the rest of the trip, and I don&#039;t like to redose.<br /><br />What are your favorite combo&#039;s?

				Personally I like the MDMA them MDA / MDMA bump then come down with 2CB. Seems to get me the most out of my night with the least hangover the next day. There&#039;s only so far you can bump MDMA but for some reason the MDA keeps it going and then the 2CB adds a nice trip to the end with a much softer landing than MDMA / MDA alone.

				On new years we did 50 mgs MDA and 100 mgs MDMA and it was pretty great, one of the most intense comeups I&#039;ve had in a really long time. I found euphoria was greatly increased by adding the MDA, which is a bit strange as I&#039;ve done 100 mgs of this MDA previously and didn&#039;t find it to be that euphoric, more psychedelic and spacey.&nbsp;
