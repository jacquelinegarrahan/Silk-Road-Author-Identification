				My guess is whoever it was dropped dead in a blizzard of cocaine and hookers.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />That&#039;s how I&#039;d imagine a proper silkroad vacation would end anyway.

				Who&#039;s up for another grand sale? Maybe an Xmas sale?<br />I know there was good things and bad things about the 420 sale (I wonder if more money was scammed than given away in prizes?).<br />But I for one have learned a good lesson from the Tony episode (I personally didn&#039;t get scammed, but knew a few who did).<br />I just feel it would give some festive excitement for Xmas, and another boast to our SR lives.<br />
