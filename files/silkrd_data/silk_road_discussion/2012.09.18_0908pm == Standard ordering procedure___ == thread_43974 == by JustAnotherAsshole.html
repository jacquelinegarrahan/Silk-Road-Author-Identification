				Good evening, <br /><br />I&#039;m planning on making my first purchase through SR, and all I am really waiting on is to get some bitcoins (Once Dwolla verifies my account). <br /><br />In the mean time, I figured I would ask you guys about the ordering procedure. It&#039;s obviously a little different from the likes of Amazon, and I don&#039;t really know where to start.<br /><br />I tried reaching out directly to a vendor for such details, but I fear that I may have spooked him. Hoping never to repeat such an incident, I humbly ask for your help.<br /><br />Thankfully, <br />JAA

				I&#039;ll take a crack at it as I&#039;m a newbie myself and had to learn this recently. Actually, when you have no BTCs it&#039;s a good time to practice placing and order <br /><br />as you can&#039;t fuck anything up. Just don&#039;t pick and item that is listed at 0.00 like a service as it will keep that in your order history.&nbsp; Here are the steps:<br /><br />1) find the item you want and hit add to cart<br />2) go into your shopping cart and select your quantity if needed and be sure to select a shipping option. This one is important or it will error out<br />3) then hit the update button directly below. Also very important or it will not catch the shipping option and error out<br />4) then pop your address where you want it shipped to into the entry box. If it is a service or password to a porn site at least put something in here or it will error out<br />5) then input your secret pin number you selected when first signing up.<br />6) then hit submit order and it will place this is your order history accessed above beside messages. You can go in here at any time to see the status.<br /><br />Your order will say processing until the vendor ships it in case it will change status. You&#039;ll also see the auto finalize option start counting down from 17 days.<br />Once you get your order, it&#039;s important to finalize the payment so the vendor gets paid. If the item does not arrive, you must contact support to extend<br />&nbsp;the auto finalize. Otherwise vendor will automatically get paid. Once they do, it will be difficult to get any money back if the item was not sent or there was a problem.<br />Check that the vendor is established and has a good history. In some cases you will be required to Finalize Early before the vendor will ship. Use common sense when<br />Doing this.

				I appreciate it. I expected it to be a little more complicated. <br /><br />So I suppose all that&#039;s left would be to use a vendor that has a high rating and plenty of sales? The majority of the established ones are trustworthy, right?

				Hold on, you forgot to mention that you have to buy a goat and sacrifice it in the name of Odin by cutting it&#039;s throat and smearing the blood upon yourself whilst singing &quot;The Bird is the Word&quot; and doing a native American circle dance. <br /><br />Come on guys, remember to be thorough!

				I suggest not using FE, as I&#039;ve seen some horror stories.<br /><br />If you keep the order small to start, chances are this will not be an issue though. Talking with the vendor can also help.

				Learn PGP encryption.<br />There&#039;s plenty of information about it on the forums, I&#039;d suggest reading up.

				Don&#039;t FE...there are plenty of vendors out there that will work with new buyers. Contact the vendor before buying, this really isn&#039;t Amazon or eBay. Just an introduction so an order doesn&#039;t just show up from nowhere.<br /><br />I only know of one vendor that doesn&#039;t use PGP. Like the previous poster said, learn it. There are great threads and a great teacher here on the forums.<br /><br />Dang....I thought I was supposed to sing &#039;Blackbird&#039; while doing the circle dance! Must be why my first order got canceled... :-\

				Nope it is 100% The Bird is the Word, to please the gods fully you should also dance like Peter Griffen while doing the circle dance.

				FE is finalizing early. This completes a transaction, and releases the funds you have in escrow to the vendor. Funds stay in escrow until you finalize, which should be after you receive what you order. Too risky for my tastes. <br /><br />If a vendor requires it, I suggest you find a different vendor. Some vendors I&#039;ve messaged with are alright with waiving FE, provided you talk to them before ordering. I&#039;ve noticed a lot of new buyers tend to FE, and then post their tales of woe. I suggest lurking the forum for a bit, and reading these.

				It&#039;s called selective scamming. A vendor ships normally to regular buyers, and those that have a high transaction rate, etc..., but something mysteriously happens when a newer buyer makes a purchase.<br /><br />Who is the community more likely to believe in this situation, an established vendor they&#039;ve purchased from, or a new buyer that has 3 posts on the forum and minimal purchases? I&#039;m sure most vendors aren&#039;t doing this, and some of these buyers are scamming, but I suggest never agreeing to FE. Any vendor worth his salt will be willing to take a minimal risk on a smaller purchase, and potentially gain another regular.<br /><br />If you&#039;re set on ordering from a vendor that requires FE, and will not waive it, good luck.<br /><br />I also agree with everyone telling you to learn PGP. It can be a bitch to pick up, but now I feel retarded for wondering how I ever struggled with it; it is more time-consuming than anything else.
