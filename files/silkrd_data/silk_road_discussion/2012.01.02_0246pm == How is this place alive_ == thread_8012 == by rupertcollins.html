				Despite being totally, 100% brand new to SR, I hope to be a happy member of the SR family, and witness the continued evolution and survival of this wonderful thing you guys have working here.<br /><br />However, I can&#039;t seem to get this perplexing question out of the back of my mind. How is this place still alive? Is it fairly new? How are the world&#039;s super powered corporate machines, with their fancy quantum computing power, not cracking down on SR?<br /><br />It was shockingly easy for myself to wander onto here, I can&#039;t imagine that the FBI or CIA, or DEA for that matter, don&#039;t know about this place. Do they simply not care?

				SR survive and its good place for biz.<br />FBI and DEA is US agencies and this is global site, pretty safe or better say, safe as can be.<br />We are pretty small drop in the sea and many of their action relie on public sensibility.<br />When SR were news then senators screamed how they will shut down SR but as we can see. nothing happened.

				The site is still up because the government agencies that have the power to take it down have not allocated the resources needed to take the website down. Without a doubt this website would be taken down if it was a top priority.

				It&#039;s only a matter of time before someone, DEA or whoever, puts an effort into shutting SR down. Hopefully we&#039;ll have a long happy life of trading drugs until that happens but it will happen eventually.

				Haha to put it simply, they can&#039;t <br /><br />I remember reading something I found funny, a certain US senator read about SR in some article and &quot;ordered&quot; the DEA to &quot;take it down immediately&quot; I love this hahaha just shows how truly ignorant and small minded these old men are.<br /><br />This is the revolution my brothers, even if this got ripped down, we all know well enough by now, we&#039;ve all made enough connections and dealt with the vendors to know a new one, under a new new or new url would pop up again in no time

				I doubt the DEA will shut this website down. The DEA isn&#039;t exactly the brightest law enforcement agency and shutting this website down would require alot of technical skill. The DEA does not have the capabilities to shut down SR they are a bunch of corrupt drug using cops that arrest other people for the same stuff that their agents do daily. It is much more likely that if any US law enforcement agency shuts this website down that it would be the FBI. The FBI is the ONLY US law enforcement agency that might care about shutting this website down AND has the skilled people that it would take to shut this place down along with the money and resources.<br /><br />As for the DEA, mainly what they do is suck on dick. The FBI though is scary because they are professional cops.

				ANY government agency can hire people to do this for them.&nbsp; Companies like Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, TASC, Raytheon etc get contracts from them all the time.&nbsp; The Feds know they are too dumb to do it, but they will eventually find someone to do it for them.&nbsp; Hell, maybe sumyungai or someone lol.&nbsp; Money talks.

				How can they shut it down if the servers aren&#039;t in the US? They don&#039;t have jurisdiction. Unless they bribe the country to shut it down, I don&#039;t see it happening. Of course he could just move the servers to another location that really dislikes the US like Pakistan and they will tell Washington to kiss their ass.<br /><br />Fear and terror will be their weapon to take SR down just like the war on drugs. They&#039;ll bust a bunch of buyers and sellers one day and post it on all the news networks to scare people away. There are lots of 3 letter government agencies that have the capability to take SR down. It&#039;s just a matter of money and priorities.

				My opinion is it doesn&#039;t matter who you are, if the feds have a hard on for you they will get you. The secret is to stay out of their way. &quot;out of site, out of mind&quot;. That&#039;s the key to success.

				The key to success is actually to use security measures that your adversary can not realistically defeat. This used to be easy enough but the surveillance technologies of tomorrow are going to neutralize the privacy software of today, and tomorrow is coming extremely fast.

				On that cheerful note...<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you have something - random key entry person - you certainly seem to know your stuff. But I also guess it&#039;s down to how badly they feel a need to &#039;shut it down&#039;. Or perhaps more importantly, if they can afford the time and financial cost in the knowledge that another site will pop up somewhere anyway. Let&#039;s face it, there are an increasing number of ways to source drugs online now. <br /><br />But aside from a PR coup, shutting this place down (and others) achieves nothing. The traffic here - in the grand scheme of the world drugs trade - is worthless. <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure that SR&#039;s life is sadly limited, but maybe it&#039;s worth their while to keep it up for a while longer so they can have a good old snoop.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t buy your last point. The surveillance and privacy wars have been going on since we climbed down from the trees. I doubt one side will win anytime soon.

If &quot;they&quot; could trace tor they would go after the drug traffickers the child pornographers and the terrorists simultaneously dumbfuck. Guess what, child porn people say the same shit about drug traffickers carders say the same shit about drug traffickers drug traffickers say about carders and child porn people fuck osama bin laden probably thought the nsa was to busy with SR to go after him judging by my experiences with every single other type of criminal, don&#039;t fall into this PSYOP cognitive trap...btw your cognitive trap has been identified and labeled in the field of intelligence analysis its called mirror imaging and it means the person who interprets intelligence thinks that his adversary thinks as he does and interprets the intelligence through his eyes instead of his adversaries...you think you are not a target but you are THE target of the DEA not a pedophile <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That, of course, proves nothing.

Law enforcement are way behind the bell curve when it comes to security and intelligence but guess what they are catching up fast and you shouldnt count on a network with known anonymity vulnerabilities against its hidden services to keep a hidden server anonymous plain and simple. Even Roger dingledine said Tor hidden services are fucked in the #tor IRC room, did you even know #tor had an IRC room? His name is Arma there and he is the lead Tor dev, I suggest you ask him if he thinks there are no known traceability attacks against hidden services but you probably already know better than he does

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That&#039;s a rather disingenuous example to use.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is an example of a technical solution for tracing a hidden service isn&#039;t it? Application layer exploits are one of the main technical solutions for tracing Tor hidden services. Also, if you remember, I also gave links to three papers, one of which explains traffic analysis based attacks for deanonymizing Tor hidden services, two of which explain measurement and signals intelligence attacks for deanonymizing Tor hidden services, and I also gave a link to freehaven which has over a dozen papers discussing technical solutions for tracing hidden services from a variety of security disciplines. So I think my *abundance* of cited examples showing that there are various methods from various fields which can be used for tracing Tor hidden services is adequate. Seriously what the fuck else do you want to be convinced, I never could understand people that ignore abundances of evidence dumped in front of them or how I can convince them to change their mind about subjects if not by an abundance of documented research from world experts.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In that example, they used an apache exploit to gain root access to a VM.

This is not the freedom hosting case, isolation protected them from deanonymization when they had virtual machines rooted. Anyway being in a VM in itself offers zero additional protection from application layer traces, you need to have network facing applications isolated in virtual machines away from external IP address and away from Tor. Also I was the first person to introduce this technique to the scene so please spare your breath trying to explain things to me that you indirectly learned from me anyway. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8012.msg73231#msg73231">Quote from: saphron on January 03, 2012, 03:19 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I wish I knew half of what you do kmf...but you do have anger issues my friend :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Maybe. I certainly have issues with people spouting off a bunch of bullshit acting like they are experts about things they know nothing about. I also have serious issues when these same people ignore all evidence.

I also gave a link to freehaven, which documents many more technical solutions. Nobody specified that the technical solutions for tracing hidden services had to be from any particular field, but I think selecting attacks from three fields, including two which have been carried out on the live Tor network and resulted in deanonymized hidden services, is more than adequate to support my claim that hidden services can be traced with known technical solutions. The police in the mentioned story were not related to anonymous and the hidden services that they deanonymized on the application layer were not hosted by freedom hosting, although similar attacks were done against freedom hosting isolation saved them from being traced. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />What you are telling us is that tor hidden services are &#039;fucked&#039; and can be tracked, but only you and a few other people know how.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anyone with the time to read through some of the documents on freehaven, who has a basic knowledge of networking and can program, can do many of these attacks against hidden services. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Now I&#039;m not saying TOR hidden services are perfect, but they do seem to be holding up atm, and while silkroad may be the sole target of the DEA, all the child porn sites, the &#039;terrorist&#039; sites, and other illegals are&nbsp; targets of other organizations, and they are still running. So until we start seeing other hidden services get de-anonymized we shouldnt have reason to believe that SR is in imminent danger/compromised. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If real terrorists used Tor they would be traced by the NSA in a matter of seconds. NSA can break though many layers of isolation and are not stopped by systems like ASLR, they also stockpile very sophisticated exploits and have teams that constantly analyze software looking for vulnerabilities. SR and all Tor hidden services are in imminent danger of having their servers deanonymized, they just don&#039;t currently have any competent attackers. DEA doesn&#039;t have any Tor experts working for them.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">By the way, calling other people names, being condescending, and tooting your own horn is not a good way to convince people of anything.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is true, although the people I care about will ignore the way I talk and instead be convinced by the huge amount of research papers I have linked to.<br /><br /><br />Here is the worst traffic analysis attack against tor hidden services:<br /><br />The attacker adds some nodes to the Tor network, this is called a Sybil attack. Now, the attacker uses a malicious client to open an arbitrary number of connections to the target hidden service. A hidden service opens a new circuit for every connection request, so the client can force the hidden service to open an arbitrary number of new circuits. Now the attacker can send data modulated in a specific pattern to the hidden service, and scan all of the data passing through their sybil nodes looking for that pattern in interpacket arrivial times. Before Tor had entry guards this attack was carried out live against the tor network and it resulted in research hidden services being traced in time periods ranging from 24 hours to one week, exact time required depended on a number of variables. Tor attempted to mitigate this attack by introducing entry guards, three nodes through which a Tor client enters all of its traffic into the network. The theory was that unless the attacker owned one of the entry guards, they would never be in an active position to observe the interpacket arrival pattern reaching the hidden service. However, it is inherently obvious that now this attack will result in the deanonymization of three nodes each one hop away from the server in a matter of time ranging from approx 24 hours to one week (maybe a little longer now the network is bigger than when this attack was carried out). After identification of these servers, the compromise of any of them will allow the attacker to identify the hidden services IP address. This compromise can be legal, technical, etc, probably le will use a trap and trace pen register order and get the ip of hidden service in 24 hours if any of the entry guards are in USA, otherwise it will take a little bit longer for international cooperation but international cooperation will come fairly fast no matter where the entry guards are located. Even if the node owner doesnt participate in the attack, somewhere upsteam will for sure and they will do a passive attack.<br /><br />That is one of many traffic analysis attacks directly against Tor hidden services. I will explain a few more pure signals intelligence attacks if people are interested. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Sorry I just thought this was an underground security subforum not yahoo answers. When people on underground security subforums say retarded shit they get called on it lest their misinformation enter the propagation cycle. Misinformation is dangerous. If people think hidden services are very anonymous they might do retarded things like use TorChat or the message system on Liberte Live and get themselves traced. In reality it is much easier to trace hidden services than regular Tor clients, and there are numerous ways in which it could be done by a significantly motivated and powerful attacker. Tor resists law enforcement well for clients, and fairly well for servers, but it does have known limitations and those limitations are very likely to be more significant than the average Tor user is aware of, particularly for hidden servers.<br /><br />edit: oh it actually isn&#039;t the security subforum

Or perhaps more importantly, if they can afford the time and financial cost in the knowledge that another site will pop up somewhere anyway. Let&#039;s face it, there are an increasing number of ways to source drugs online now. <br /><br />But aside from a PR coup, shutting this place down (and others) achieves nothing. The traffic here - in the grand scheme of the world drugs trade - is worthless. <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure that SR&#039;s life is sadly limited, but maybe it&#039;s worth their while to keep it up for a while longer so they can have a good old snoop.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t buy your last point. The surveillance and privacy wars have been going on since we climbed down from the trees. I doubt one side will win anytime soon.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i never claimed they would trace SR even if they could. They will use it for a human intelligence honeypot long before that. They might never even take the thing down even if they took control of the server. Human intelligence is by far the most worrying thing. Nym sybil attacks are cheap to do on silk road and there is no trust rank system or connection to private groups to prevent someone from flooding nyms. Charging for seller accounts adds somewhat of a limitation to the size of their flood, but they do have a lot of money. Selling accounts is actually a great security measure on SR&#039;s part, although if it isnt a flat rate price it should be im not sure if it is currently auctioned off but an auction can be gamed easier by a malicious SR to tilt human intelligence nodes towards the feds. I actually have some good cryptographic solutions for a secure membership recruitment system that attempts to maintain anonymity while verifying presence in a community prior to a certain date (assuming that at some point in time feds will begin massively nym flooding public internet drug discussion forums with nyms to poison the &#039;probably not a fed&#039; recruitment well)<br /><br />interception is also always a worry even if you are sound on the human intelligence front, but we were working on developing a technical solution to this based on measurement and signature intelligence themes, check out the interception detection thread in security subforum here if you are interested in the technical details<br /><br />and of course the privacy wars will go on forever, but all it takes is for their surveillance technology to beat your security implementation a single time before you are fucked, so i dont care if privacy gets ahead sometime in the future if the currently available privacy software wont keep my ass out of prison today<br /><br />it really is only a matter of time before the feds do a massive technical bust of some sort against people using techniques that were considered to be secure very recently. <br />

				Hey, kmfkewm. Even though it&#039;s pretty clear that you&#039;re a Genius God from the Planet Expert sent from the future to help us with your knowledge and all that, it wouldn&#039;t hurt to be a bit more polite. Would it?<br /><br />We can all tell that you&#039;re pretty savvy in computer engineering, but there&#039;s another type of engineering - &quot;social engineering&quot; - that teaches us that people respond better to lessons when they don&#039;t feel like the teacher is trying to pull out their eyes and skullfuck them.<br /><br />Just sayin&#039;.

				The only people bad-mouthing kmfkewm&#039;s comments are immature and probably teenagers. It is quite obvious by the way they reply. These are the same people who say &#039;fuck my teacher&#039; in school and don&#039;t pay attention. You are doomed to be retarded for the rest of your life so do society a favor and just blow your brains out and increase the IQ of the overall population.<br /><br />That said yes sometimes he gets a little hot in his replies, but I don&#039;t blame him as you can see this has gotten me a little hot (no need to acknowledge my sexiness). He is right about people spreading dangerous misinformation. You realize that most academic institutions won&#039;t even allow Wikipedia as a cited source, because of the fact anyone can edit it. Wikipedia is correct 99% of the time. Now think about that and then think about the people that frequent this forum. Always be skeptical of what you believe on these forums and if someone seems intelligent and a security expert, then they probably are. If someone seems like a teenager who figured out how to install the tor browser bundle, they probably are.

				I&#039;ll concede this guy knows more about tor and probably network security in general, than I do. Of course, he&#039;s an ill-mannered douchebag who probably has no friends beyond the people who he sucks up to on irc, but he does know what he&#039;s talking about for the most part. It&#039;s a shame he has to behave that way instead of engaging in simple, polite debate. If you think I&#039;m wrong, point it out. Insulting people only detracts from the value of what you&#039;re saying, and only encourages people to disagree with you, when your goal is to get people to agree with you.<br /><br />Nobody was ever suggesting tor somehow protects you from application layer attacks. That&#039;s kind of a ridiculous straw-man to even attempt. <br /><br />So, put your dick back in your pants. You&#039;ve made your point. You like computers, but not people. You made it clear that you&#039;re one of a handful of people that thinks they know how to expose the location of a hidden service using only network layer techniques. <br /><br />You&#039;ve successfully stopped the horrible misinformation from spreading. But you might want to shout a little louder...pretty sure that almost everybody who provides a hidden black market service would like to know that they are exposed and vulnerable and probably compromised already and being used as a honey pot by TLAs. You&#039;d think you&#039;d have loftier goals than shouting down somebody on a forum....because while my &quot;misinformation&quot; may have really pissed you off to the point where you slapped your dog, it&#039;s &quot;misinformation&quot; that is shared by, oh, I would guess about 95% of the users on tor? With the rest of the other 5% being people who don&#039;t know anything about it at all other than that&#039;s how you get to silk road?<br /><br />So, perhaps you could realize that you&#039;re not &quot;correcting misinformation&quot;, you&#039;re actually asserting something that is contrary to the general understanding of almost all of your audience, and therefore you should be taking a tone of &quot;education and explanation&quot; rather than &quot;ego-maniacal ranting&quot;.<br /><br />Oh, and smoke a fucking bowl for christ&#039;s sake.

You have no clue what you are talking about. FBI or anyone else can do an active attack merely by adding nodes to the network, they do not need to do a fully passive attack and they almost certainly will have better luck with an at least partially active attack.

That&#039;s why Tor have &quot;family&quot; option in torrc.conf file. That&#039;s why there is entry nodes, Tor will always use them to avoid selecting random nodes each time who might be malicious.<br /><br />And You can get to know where the SR server is located. Now You must decrypt the datastream to prove beyond reason of doubt that the content in question is served from that location. Possible? And then they will need to decrypt TrueCrypt or dm-crypt/LUKS encrypted harddrives of that poor server. Meanwhile the SR backup will be run from another server halfway across globe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is unlikely that they will build the entire circuit by luck, although they only need to own one out of three key nodes (entry guards) to deanonymize the server. They can find the entry guard by doing the attack I already explained the technical details of. No you don&#039;t need to decrypt the stream to prove beyond reason of doubt that the content in question is served from that location, you can just send the SR server a message with a self introduced pattern in the inter packet arrival times and then observe the line looking for that pattern. That will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the SR server has been located. They would also have pretty good luck using a website fingerprinting attack, CCC made a classifier that can identify a website by analysis of the encrypted Tor stream with 60% accuracy. There are other traffic analysis techniques that can prove to various degrees, often beyond a reasonable doubt, that the server has been located. Another thing they could do is restart the server at the data center and then observe silk road website and see if there is a down time correlation, this is called an intersection attack. So there I gave three examples of how you are wrong, would you like me to continue because I can go on about this all day if need be.<br /><br />Also they are not going to need to decrypt Truecrypt or DM-crypt because they will just flash freeze the ram and dump it into a forensic laptop, then they will recover the encryption keys. I doubt silk road is even using encapsulation material or physical intrusion detection systems on his server to try to prevent this, but if enough of a fuck was given about Silk Road the military of USA has already gotten around tamper resistant memory systems similar to this. <br /><br />Anyway they will try to minimize down time as much as possible if they do an attack stemming from physical seizure of the server. After all, they would rather spy on the unecrypted addresses noobs are sending through the SR server, and possibly use SR server as a position to carry out application layer attacks against clients, etc, than they would take down such a valuble intelligence source and scare everyone away from it. <br /><br />Nice try though.&nbsp; Also I doubt even the FBI is stupid enough to add all of their Tor nodes to the same family, that would prevent them from being used to do a substantial number of attacks against the Tor network. Entry guards help prevent a lot of attacks if you are using them properly (if you are using a live CD that doesn&#039;t have persistence, like Amnesia, you are not properly using entry guards). However, entry guards will only slightly slow many attackers down if the target is a hidden service (or if the target has their browser taken over and has used isolation, although if the user has their browser taken over and they are not using isolation techniques they are fucked already).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If what you said is true, which it looks like it could be, wouldn&#039;t you be like, helping the fbi learn how to take down SR with that kind of information?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It isn&#039;t like it is classified. Anyway I have a collection of law enforcement training documents and other manuals and statistics relating to them, and I believe in one of the career path papers I have from FBI it says they start teaching their agents traffic analysis after 8 years at quantico if they go down the cyber crime career path. It isn&#039;t like the FBI doesn&#039;t have anyone who knows anything about traffic analysis working for them, although in 2008 they did fail to trace Tor clients that were used by a group of violent pedophiles including ones who were posting new material. Then again, tracing clients is a more impressive feat than hidden services, and they got many of the pedos who were using VPN&#039;s or posting pictures via photographic forensics.

				What a vague topic filled with dick-measuring and name calling.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />To sum this all up, SR is alive because it&#039;s just secure enough and just discreet enough to stay out of harms way. The day the feds&#039; tech makes a leap and overtakes our security is coming and SR will be taken down when this lines up with a period of inter-agency cooperation if not international cooperation which will probably only happen if SR gets a LOT more traffic.<br /><br />Just be happy we have it, use it while it lasts, and be careful. Knowledge is power and - in the case of SR - can keep us all out of jail. <br /><br />knowing is half the battle, knowledge is power, loose lips sink ships, etc. etc.

				Just how many more would be a LOT, to consider it a LOT more traffic? <br />Here&#039;s a short summary of about the last month:<br />to give you a break down of Welcome Wagon in the time that it ran it determined there were on average 437 new user registrations a day or roughly 19 new users a hour :) of those users 34% of them actually read the message within 20 min 67 within 24 hours and 73% within 72 hours with the remaining going unread of those users in the duration of running 32,342 Users were sent private messages of those 73% of the 32,342 users only 19% replied to the message of those 19% of users whom replied 98% of them were positive and asked for help or just wanted to thank me 2 % were already users i suspect and were just lik omg wtf ect ect<br /><br />of those 73% of users in comparison to my personal sales only about 1% give or take were customers<br /><br />and based of some other stats only about 6% of the users who were sent pm&#039;s were return visitors <br /><br />And full post here:http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7956.msg75523#msg75523<br /><br />I&#039;m not discrediting anything you said, but I thought those numbers represented a lot.

This would be very bad for him though because Tor hidden services are much more likely to be traced than clients. The memory freezing technique is actually straight out of any basic computer forensics manual published in the past few years. Even before flash freezing they were dumping RAM into forensic laptops. Of course this implies above average law enforcement, many of them have out dated training and still power down machines, but particularly against CP people they have started doing flash freezing and live RAM dumps on targets. It is not in the realm of advanced LE only anymore. Later when I have more time i will link you to several cases where LE used attacks like this. So in short what I am trying to say is welcome to the talk out of your ass about shit you don&#039;t know a fucking thing about club. I am not some fucking retard talking about things I have absolutely no experience with, so think about your own credentials before you open your mouth and spew bullshit at me because chances are high you will just be helping me&nbsp; in wasting my time otherwise. <br /><br />Also, although SWAT teams have in many cases barged in and dumped RAM to forensic laptops, sometimes using flash freezing, if the server is stored in a data center none of the physical security measures are going to do shit against a warrant unless SR has a tamper resistant case with chasis intrusion detection hardware configured to go into a memory wipe when the case is penetrated. I don&#039;t know how much luck LE will have against those systems, but the military will likely have little trouble with them.<br /><br />BTW I have contact with multiple people who have worked for real intelligence and military agencies, I don&#039;t need to tell you shit from movies :)<br /><br />Speaking of which you clearly fail to see the distinction between evidence and intelligence<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I will stop posting in this tread.

The feds may never even use the seized SR server in a court of law, or let it be known that it was seized and taken over. They will use it as a honeypot if enough people send unencrypted addresses. The way the address was targeted never needs to be shown in court, the fact that a package with drugs heading to it was intercepted and a CD took place is enough to fuck the target. The drug package is evidence, the addresses to target gained from the server compromise are intelligence. Usually smart players don&#039;t like to compromise their intelligence source by revealing it. <br /><br />I wonder how many of the retards arguing with me in security threads are federal agents engaging in a disinformation campaign&nbsp; (afraid of SR peeps becoming as secure as OVDB peeps ?) and how many of them are stupid kids who think they know know everything. Try to learn instead of act like you already know shit, you guys are massively degrading the quality of information on this forum and causing confusion, either intentionally or unintentionally.

This has its own risks in the forensics and traceability departments, but it does give a few advantages primarily you don&#039;t need to trust a pre-installed configuration from the data center and you can use fancy hardware security systems / techniques, for exampe chasis intrusion detection / memory encapsulation systems. You can also get the advantage of not using a data center installed OS if you buy a server with a KVM switch, this gives remote access to the boot sequence, bios and allows you to install an OS remotely as well, although I am not certain I think it is still not as secure from data center positioned attackers who want to root kit you as sending in your own server is. However sending in your own server has too many other risks imo and isn&#039;t worth tamper resistance since most of the benefits you would get by having a tamper resistant case can be gained by using asymmetric encryption systems anyway. <br /><br />Anyway you are either an agent or one of the dime a dozen retards who argues incorrect bullshit and refuses to believe documented evidence when proven wrong. I still have trouble to differentiate between people who are mentally retarded and federal agents, I think it might be because of the large degree of overlap though.

In some states you can probably get very fucked for getting drugs in mail even as compared to federal. Plus you are probably also chargable for federal money laundering which could get you twenty years in prison if they really wanted to fuck you. You probably break a number of other laws also, every time you get drugs in mail pay for them participate in a network that trafficks them (you can probably be charged under RICO for participating in a drug trafficking organization and get a life sentence if they really want to fuck you....SR is probably the largest drug trafficking network that has a formalized name that I have ever heard of but it is still a drug trafficking network and a DTO in the eyes of the DEA. Silk Road is a more modern sort of drug trafficking network, this sort of network and the techniques we use were actually first mentioned in a paper by a US military think tank, it is titled Netwar: the future of crime terrorism and militancy , and discusses concepts such as product swarming (massive network with individual nodes moving small amounts, breaking large amounts up into smaller packets etc) encrypted communication, network overlays etc. <br /><br />although a lodging of wayfaring men is a nice cypherpunk fiction book that also describes things it might be more appropriate for the SR audience than a serious research paper

				You have a link to Netwar? I&#039;m gonna google it, too, but links are handy :) Very interesting. <br />I&#039;m still new to SR, as well, but one positive aspect of SR is that it reduces the risk of bodily injury when acquiring drugs. Some people live in really bad places in the world, USA included, but is least of worries, I think...well, maybe Netherlands, right. Anyway, some people in Africa, or South America have to deal with warring gangs and tyrannical governments to get drugs. I think there are quite a few who now opt for SR, to avoid death squads. Literally. <br />SR alleviates the crimes that hamper our pursuit of happiness...i.e. legal drugs. <br />Although legalizing may end much of the violence, it&#039;s that same violence that keeps the war alive. <br />A government can NEVER be wrong, so I do not see legalization anytime in the future.

I say look like as i havent a clue as to most you said hehe....went right over my head.<br /><br />That said im here to buy a small amount of drugs every now and then (say every few months), if i get caught from a lapse in my own (very limited) security knowledge what will happen? Ill get a slap on the wrist, told not to do it again and thats all.<br /><br />For your average user all those security related issues dont matter as much as you imply at the end of the day, yes they do to dealers who take more risk etc, but like i said for us buyers the worse we can expect is a slap on the wrist.<br /><br />Im not bothered if tor can be traced or not, so far i ent been caught and if/when i do there are alternatives<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wouldn&#039;t be so sure of that, if you are in USA getting drugs via mail its automatically a federal crime and you would very likely get at least a few years in prison if you had any amount of schedule one drugs intercepted, although you would probably have your case given to state and do most time on parole. In some states you can probably get very fucked for getting drugs in mail even as compared to federal. Plus you are probably also chargable for federal money laundering which could get you twenty years in prison if they really wanted to fuck you. You probably break a number of other laws also, every time you get drugs in mail pay for them participate in a network that trafficks them (you can probably be charged under RICO for participating in a drug trafficking organization and get a life sentence if they really want to fuck you....SR is probably the largest drug trafficking network that has a formalized name that I have ever heard of but it is still a drug trafficking network and a DTO in the eyes of the DEA. Silk Road is a more modern sort of drug trafficking network, this sort of network and the techniques we use were actually first mentioned in a paper by a US military think tank, it is titled Netwar: the future of crime terrorism and militancy , and discusses concepts such as product swarming (massive network with individual nodes moving small amounts, breaking large amounts up into smaller packets etc) encrypted communication, network overlays etc. <br /><br />although a lodging of wayfaring men is a nice cypherpunk fiction book that also describes things it might be more appropriate for the SR audience than a serious research paper<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Im not from the us, but even so i doubt first offenders would face jail terms. A friend of mine has been caught trying to import what the USA would say is a schedule 1 (the highest if im correct, if not correct me) drug and all that happened was a letter from customs warning him the contents had an illegal substance in. Not even a call from the police and a warning, nothing!<br /><br />Im not stupid enough to try and import enough gear at once so it can be seen with the potential to supply, which may end up with a jail term.<br /><br />When i first heard if this place i seen it as an untraceable marketplace i can get drugs from, and while i dont doubt any of your warnings....you know your stuff, i just havnt heard of anyone get caught (yet!). If and when this happens ill reconsider using this place.

				If you are in USA and have any schedule one other than weed intercepted the chances are very high that you will be doing at the minimum a few months locked up but much more likely you will get a few years.

				I disagree.&nbsp; The odds of a first-time offender in the USA getting a *few years in jail* for receiving a small, personal-use amount of some schedule 1 substance in the mail are fairly slim.&nbsp; Does that mean it won&#039;t or can&#039;t happen?&nbsp; No, of course not - and if you&#039;re receiving enough that it could be considered more than a personal-use amount (whatever the law says about that particular substance) - then you might well be in deep shit.&nbsp; But there&#039;s a lot that has to happen between the time that the pigs intercept your package and the time they bust down your door in order for that to really be considered much of a possibility.

				I&#039;ve seen two things concerning this topic in the media.<br /><br />The first is an article that implies that governments are powerless to stop the silk road because tor connections are encrypted. There&#039;s also a mention of PostmanPot.<br /><br />http://preview.tinyurl.com/7y2m6l9<br /><br />The second is a youtube video about how governments have attempted to block Tor, and how you can help if you&#039;re tech savvy.<br /><br />http://preview.tinyurl.com/6rs6ufk<br /><br />The only way that tor could be stopped if goverments try to block connections with certain ip&#039;s. Some are already doing this, it could be a matter of time before others decide to do so. Like with SOPA, if they attempt this garbage then we should let them know that we don&#039;t agree.<br /><br /><br />

				The reason why what I am saying is contrary to the belief of almost my entire audience is because almost all of my audience was exposed to misinformation about Tor from dumbasses like you who talk about things they don&#039;t know about. Nobody who actually knows about Tor thinks that there is no technical way to trace a hidden service, so the only people who are saying this are either talking out of their assholes or have been exposed to misinformation from others who do so. I am sorry if you were merely exposed to misinformation and are mindlessly propagating it rather than intentionally making shit up for whatever reason, but really in either case it irritates the fuck out of me and you deserve to be bitched at. <br /><br />This thread is a perfect example of why I have little tolerance for people who are blatantly talking out of their assholes without even TRYING to properly understand the material or even find the material required to form an opinion (guess what it isn&#039;t a news article that says Tor is untraceable). Because of people intentionally talking out of their ass about things they know nothing about, or intentionally spreading misinformation to their adversaries, or people propagating bullshit they hear without verification or deeper understanding, the majority of people running Tor hidden services are at far greater risk than they realize. This irritates me because it puts peoples lives in danger. I am even irritated that the Tor devs only make the &#039;security pitfalls&#039; of Tor that the user can fix be well known (like cookies, flash proxy by pass attacks, etc) while the real serious attacks on the actual design of Tor are hidden away in TL:DR academic research papers that sometimes are not even directly discussing Tor in the first place. I am also very irritated that they still say &quot;Tor prevents anyone from learning your location or browsing habits.&quot; on their homepage, when they know it isn&#039;t true (for example they know Tor offers zero protection from a global passive adversary). <br /><br />I do trust the Tor people though and I think they are some of the best researchers when it comes to anonymity. For what it is worth the lead dev of Tor, Roger Dingledine, used to work for the NSA. This isn&#039;t widely known and I think it probably should be. He openly admits it if questioned, but the average user of Tor is not aware of the fact. I personally am not afraid of that fact since Tor is audited by so many other people, but I do find it somewhat strange that he went from working for a signals intelligence agency to working on a tool for countering signals intelligence. Then again, NSA also wants to counter signals intelligence. Also most people who take anonymity seriously realize that the NSA can trace Tor users, either via proxy by pass attacks or in many cases (probably the majority, especially if the target uses Tor regularly for an extended period of time) by actual signals intelligence analysis.

By posting it, I wasn&#039;t implying that Tor connections couldn&#039;t be traced, I was pointing out that current governments aren&#039;t aware of how to deal with Tor.<br /><br />If you want to teach people about these problems, it doesn&#039;t help when you start calling everyone who isn&#039;t informed a dumbass. Nobody will respect you or care about your opinion after that point.<br /><br /><br />Anyone concerned: If you want to know more about security problems with Tor it can be as easy as looking up the Wiki page and looking under the weaknesses tab: http://preview.tinyurl.com/ys5wdz

				kmfkewm, unlike others, I appreciate your information (even if some of it does go WAAAAAAAY over my head&nbsp; :-\), and I don&#039;t doubt you given the Tor site even lists it&#039;s security issues.<br /><br />That said, clearly we&#039;re all here for a reason, so a couple of questions if I may; what should we be doing to be more secure, and more broadly for my own curiosity, is there something better than Tor? Or (as I assume) nothing infallible as as been proven to just about every supposedly &#039;secure&#039; government site in the past?

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Don&#039;t you think using pgp encryption is enough?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In addition to that you should be using a secure application (web browser or otherwise) when using Tor to avoid a &quot;bad apple attack&quot;. An insecure application can be exploited to reveal the source of an IP address.<br /><br />You should also be aware that connections exiting the network aren&#039;t protected. A Swedish security consultant was able to obtain people&#039;s passwords by operating and monitoring exit nodes.<br /><br />I also heard that you shouldn&#039;t use BitTorrent over Tor, because it isn&#039;t secure.<br /><br />I also read that Tor streams can be traced through traffic analysis, but the identity of the user cannot be discovered. Bad apple attacks can discover your IP however.<br /><br />All of this is coming from the main Wiki article for Tor.<br /><br />There&#039;s also a big ass thing about safety on the Tor download page:<br /><br />Use the Tor Browser<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tor does not protect all of your computer&#039;s Internet traffic when you run it. Tor only protects your applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor. To avoid problems with Tor configuration, we strongly recommend you use the Tor Browser Bundle. It is pre-configured to protect your privacy and anonymity on the web as long as you&#039;re browsing with the Tor Browser itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be unsafe to use with Tor.<br /><br />Don&#039;t enable or install browser plugins<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Tor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. Similarly, we do not recommend installing additional addons or plugins into the Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your anonymity and privacy. The lack of plugins means that Youtube videos are blocked by default, but Youtube does provide an experimental opt-in feature (enable it here) that works for some videos.<br /><br />Use HTTPS versions of websites<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tor will encrypt your traffic to and within the Tor network, but the encryption of your traffic to the final destination website depends upon on that website. To help ensure private encryption to websites, the Tor Browser Bundle includes HTTPS Everywhere to force the use of HTTPS encryption with major websites that support it. However, you should still watch the browser URL bar to ensure that websites you provide sensitive information to display a blue or green URL bar button, include https:// in the URL, and display the proper expected name for the website.<br /><br />Don&#039;t open documents downloaded through Tor while online<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Tor Browser will warn you before automatically opening documents that are handled by external applications. DO NOT IGNORE THIS WARNING. You should be very careful when downloading documents via Tor (especially DOC and PDF files) as these documents can contain Internet resources that will be downloaded outside of Tor by the application that opens them. This will reveal your non-Tor IP address. If you must work with DOC and/or PDF files, we strongly recommend either using a disconnected computer, downloading the free VirtualBox and using it with a virtual machine image with networking disabled, or using Tails. Under no circumstances is it safe to use BitTorrent and Tor together, however.<br /><br />Use bridges and/or find company<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you connect to. However, by default, it does not prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from learning that you&#039;re using Tor. If this matters to you, you can reduce this risk by configuring Tor to use a Tor bridge relay rather than connecting directly to the public Tor network. Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!
