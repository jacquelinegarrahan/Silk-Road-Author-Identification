				All types of customs and LEO&#039;s have crossed the line since the dawn of time, the temptation would be a killer!&nbsp; Unlikely that these guys randomly grab someone else&#039;s order though, they would be expecting and looking out for the packages that they help get through the gates.&nbsp; Besides, blokes at that level would be a fair way removed from sorting (and detecting) a gram or two in the mail.&nbsp; If you are a &#039;big buyer&#039; maybe... but for the average person ordering a gram or two of this or that I still think the risk of detection in the mail system is bloody low!<br /><br />thanks for the food for thought though&nbsp; :)

				JezuzWazaMushroom - If I could -1 you I would my friend.<br /><br />That&#039;s one hell of a cynical attitude your carrying there !<br />But the -1 would actually be for being condescending to Thisisnotashillaccount without any provocation by saying &quot;I suggest you see more of the world and get back to us and you will learn fast...&quot;<br /><br />Do you really think that if all people were more &quot;instinctual, cruel and selfish by nature &quot; than &quot;empathetic, kind and generous by nature&quot; that the human race would have prospered such as it has (relatively speaking) ?
