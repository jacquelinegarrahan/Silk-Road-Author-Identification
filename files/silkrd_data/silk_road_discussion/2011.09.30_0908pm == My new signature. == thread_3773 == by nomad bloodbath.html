				It seems to me being a nice guy and ignoring the fact that 20+ PM&#039;sa day come to about advice and not any kinda btc tip for said advice in compensation has forced me to ignore such advice in the future without a donation to my&nbsp; moderation tip jar on SRM under the name &quot;nomad bloodbath&quot;. <br />It saddens be top have to appear so callous and sounding like such an asshole but I spend so much time practically modding the entire forum not just my section lately that I do not have the time or strength to deal with these&nbsp; common questions.<br />I suggest sending your questions to Silk Road himself on his PM either here on the forums or the SRM.<br />It seems he would be better at answering most questions anyway.<br />I will however will give the best advice I can and work hard to find you the facts myself for a single BTC donation to my tip jar on SRM.<br />Like i&#039;ve said it saddens me to put this into effect but the time and effort I put into the forums seems to greatly be ignored with any kinda compensation or appreciation. I&#039;d rather just have you direct them at Silk Road and see how his advice helps you instead for a period of time. I tend to average less than 5 btc a month as it is yet answer over 500+pm&#039;s a month.<br />I&#039;m very very open to discussion of this matter and would appreciate any feedback on this situation.<br /><br />:D <br />nomad bloodbath

First of all, PM&#039;ing mod&#039;s for advice is a warnable offense. That&#039;s what the forums are for -- advice -- free, community mediated advice. Also the philosophy is different. We don&#039;t do the job for BTC and donations, we do it for love of the game, and respect from the community. We were awarded mod status as recognition of our contributions to the community.. not so we could profit, but so we could get that respect and have a say in shaping things. Also, as someone who has input in recruiting new mods, we chose them for their value to the team. If they get a buzz and a kick out of helping others, and keeping some order, then they are valuable.<br /><br />The whole scenario of advice for BTC seems to be destined for disappointment (as is already evident) -- especially in a forum built around the principle of members offering advice to each other, not for the BTC, but to strengthen the knowledge base, and facilitate safety and exchange of information. <br /><br />I think you&#039;re doing the right thing in setting a higher deterrent to people trying to PM you... at the same time though, its not clear whether you&#039;re disappointed that so many people are PM&#039;ing you, or that you&#039;re not seeing a profit from it. I think setting your goal as &quot;mod who profits financially from being mod&quot; is setting yourself up for disappointment. A simple sig such as &quot;Do not PM mods for advice&quot; would be most effective. Unless there is a reason or service you provide PM support.

				I do give freely advice on the forums but when i get the same questions on the forum PM&#039;s that could easily be found with a few differently types of searches which can found by sinply changing a few words in the search feature using a different wording it becomes overwhelming. <br />I&#039;m sure very few envy the position I am in and the misinformation placed around on the forums I can&#039;t stand and prefer to answer with correct information. It has been told to me that I do too much work on this forum and should really cut back my time i dedicate to the forums and that the forums are a place that rarely get thought of and is the last thing on someones mind...I do not except this as the forums are the most looked after places to help those with real answers to real problems. I don&#039;t do this for bitcoins but they are overwhelming me to provide correct information has caused me to feel obliged to help in any way i feel helps for each person that comes to me for answers. <br />I will be cutting back my hours on the forums to a less stressful position on the forums, this includes going on a vacation in the morning and being gone til Monday.<br /><br />I love this community and want it to prosper and it&#039;s a place I want members to feel to ask question but the questions should be more directed at the community at large to receive the input of various members and not just my opinion. I am not doing this for BTC but some small compensation would be nice I felt a 3 cent donation would not be that big of a deal for receiving correct information but that was largely ignored as I am now flipping the coin to ignore questions that the community could help answer or Silk Road himself would have the very factual answer to some questions which I can not answer all questions because in most cases I am left out of the Issues with SRM just the same as every other member. <br /><br />Do not take me for a greedy person looking for payment for simply talking to members via PM but as a frustrated over worked person with too much weight on my back. Maybe I do work so hard on the forums like a drug addict would work all day to get their fix that night but I do care for the community and the care to have the forums grow and become a safe environment for all to enjoy.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				Promotion to staff or mod-team leader would be ideal. Hard thing is, how do you get recognition for the contribution so far (unless all PMs are saved). As a staff or super mod, you can get a regular BTC flow, and train a small team (of volunteers) to do the remedial tasks which were formerly your tasks.<br /><br />I think there is some envy potential. As a mod here you have leadership status of all of us, and that&#039;s definitely respectable and enviable. Now just to push through to the next level.

				no you are coming off clear with your POV, but if the big boss doesnt care what goes on here I&#039;m wondering what my responsibility here is even needed but to simply delete offensive post and try to keep the peace in simply bickering?<br /><br />I feel more vendors themselves should step up with btc donation as I do practically personal research with mist vendors items and valid the items to the community, sadly about three vendors ever step up to donate a bytc for helping promote their products though I put many personal btc into their products to do my own research for the community so they can be rest assured when placing orders with the vendors.<br /><br />These are just things that have been on my mind lately and I do not expect anything from anyone, I&#039;m just saying it would be nice every once in a why.<br /><br />Like i&#039;ve said I&#039;m taking a vacation and see how I feel early next week.<br /><br />:D <br />nomad bloodbath<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Like this alternate scenario..<br /><br />You get a small team under your command. Each has a mod team link in the sig for a donation to a central wallet/kitty. As overseer of the team you oversee the kitty. If it goes over xx-btc per month, you distribute the surplus.. if not over surplus, well, not shares for the volunteer yet.<br /><br />And who knows, *maybe* the system you already got is the best possible. You current system has a personal effect. People get help from you directly, and they contribute to you directly. I just think though, if that is the ideal system, we wouldn&#039;t be in this discussion now... some potential is here, just a matter to unlock it.

				Yes a agree i wish more ppl would step into this disscussion.<br />There are so many things about SR i wish I could tell you guys but I&#039;d probably get demodded which I doubt anything would actually happen or even really care at this point if it did but it&#039;s not in the best interest of SR at large to share such details.<br /><br />Please more posts from other members on this discussion.<br /><br /><br />:D <br />BRBDMT<br />nomad bloodbath

				nomad- Don&#039;t worry about being demodded. Worry about being beheaded. I do. Lol. I know we both know a lot. You prolly more than me in most areas. We both know better, brighter days are coming. More and tighter security (that&#039;s what I get excited about), new exciting features, other hush-hush stuff. I&#039;d LOVE to TALK about it. It would be fun and thought provoking that&#039;s for sure. I JUST WON&#039;T. For me and the site in general. Safety is paramount. Loose lips sink ships.<br />You are appreciated. SR and everyone else behind the scenes care. Despite anything to the contrary/actions. Hang in there champ. We all are/get frustrated and overwhelmed at times. I got some more BTC coming soon. You know I will spread the love around.<br /><br />Your job as a moderator is difficult. Giving advice. Again and again. Settling disputes. Again. And whatever else you do to achieve the results you get. I don&#039;t know the process. I only know you are good at it. I hope you can switch it up and love modding even more.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;While you are on vacation, let a monkey take over for a while. A helper monkey. Look into it. I will send 2 BTC, later.&nbsp; ;) You know I am good for it. Less stress for you if the monkey is answering your messages. More free time for nomad.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; Ya, that&#039;s the ticket.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; Helper monkeys are where its at. Maybe a small team of monkeys...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Have a good weekend nomad. I took the liberty of viewing your last 100 posts in profile.. and.. whoa! Its a heavy and intense job you have. Respect for the scope of the situation now. Yeah I modded b4, still do, but never been in the middle of some of the shit I saw here.. wtf, a dispute something about $22,000.. not sure if I read it right. I saw how you can blend in and mix it up with the regulars, also kick ass that needs to be kicked. Takes some mastery.. compartmentalization or mode-switching or something.<br /><br />Looking forward to throwing some ideas n thoughts when you return. <br />
