				They&#039;re at 16.62 currently. Funny enough, I was actually going to invest a pretty chunk of money on them last night but talked myself out of it. So glad I didn&#039;t buy.<br /><br />My guess is that it will continue to go down, but won&#039;t go any lower than 15 or so. Then it will stabilize for a bit and skyrocket again.<br /><br />But no one really knows with bitcoins, they can do anything.

				Someone bought 30,000 bitcoins earlier I believe.&nbsp; That&#039;s not a typo.&nbsp; 30,000 coins, not 30k worth in USD.&nbsp; This may have been why the price plummeted.&nbsp; But who knows.

				I hope people won&#039;t sell your bitcoins in panic because panic is always stupid we have to keep calm and bitcoin will still be strong.<br />For me and other vendors high exchange rate of bitcoin is good fact.

Typically when one party purcahses a large amount of a limited commodity, that makes the remaining amount more, not less, valuable. Hopefully this is just a momentary destabilization, and the value starts rising soon.

It&#039;s when too many coins get sold that the price plummets.....It&#039;s true, someone actually did buy that many coins, but way too many people sold as well, and that is what caused the drop. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110921.msg759942#msg759942">Quote from: SelfSovereignty on January 24, 2013, 11:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Read it on bitcointalk.org.&nbsp; No, I don&#039;t use that forum, I just poke around when I notice a big jump to see what&#039;s going on.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You really should user that forum! I have met several people on there that I buy coins from for no fees at Gox current rate. In fact, I bought $10,000 worth of coins a couple months ago from someone I met there. They were at $12 and change each, and the person sold them to me for $10 even. I told myself when they hit $20 I would sell my earnings, and let my winnings go to work for me. I thought today was the day, but it looks like I&#039;m gonna have to wait a little while longer. :)
