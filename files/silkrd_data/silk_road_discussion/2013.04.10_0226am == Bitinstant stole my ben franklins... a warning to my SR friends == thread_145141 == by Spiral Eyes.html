				&nbsp; Ok my fellow roaders, it&#039;s official . These scum bags have taken my money and do not intend to make good on the deposit I made, and I have proof that I made it. Some of you may have seen my other threads, asking for advice and what have you. It&#039;s been almost 2 weeks since I made a money gram deposit to bitinstant. They confirmed they got my money, and gave me an INVALID Mt gox code. In the last 2 weeks, they have ignored me, passed me off to various agents, supposedly sent 2 of my emails directly to CHARLIE the CEO, but mostly just aggressively refused to make good on the several hundred dollar deposit I made to them through moneygram.&nbsp; Its been about 4-5 days since they&#039;ve responded to me. So last night I sent an email stating that if I didn&#039;t get my money or resolution by tonight, I&#039;d have no choice but to consider my money stolen by them, and that I have a large audience ( you all ) that will hear the details of my misfortune . An audience that has other options&nbsp; for making their deposits. I have received no reply from said fuckwads. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So, my friends , I hereby warn you. Bitinstant has stolen my fucking money. Flat out taken my my money and not given me anything for it. Several emails have resulted in not one apology for mishandling my hard earned hundreds, not one assurance that I will get my money back, not one iota of anything resembling customer service. I&#039;m telling you folks, in all that I have seen from these fuck wads in the last 2 weeks, it feels very much like getting mugged. Apparently I have no recourse, no action I can take to hold them accountable. No better business bureau or the like. This fucking sucks people. All I can do is warn you all, and ask you to find yourself a better option. They have my hundreds, but they don&#039;t have to have yours. Sure, I made a few transactions with these assholes that went well. But not worth the hundreds they stole. And you may get lucky too. But if someone stole money from my friends, I would never do business with them again. Not if I had options. You&#039;ve been warned.

				Spiral we thank you for the heads up.<br /><br />Ive been following this cluster fuck very closely as I myself have been looking recently to making my first bitcoin purchase, and while i may be a newb to buying bitcoin I am no noob in the world of researching what I am getting into, actually &quot;listening&quot;&nbsp; , and understanding what is going on. <br /><br />All i can say now is it &quot;sounds&quot; as if Bitinstant are a bunch of frauds at &quot;current&quot;, there are conspiracy theories flying all over reddit, from them not having the actual money to transfer, to transactions being lost entirely, to the system being fucked after the hacking that occurred... see below.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/03/digital-thieves-pull-off-12000-bitcoin-heist/<br /><br />I think its all related, maybe there randomly choosing transactions to fuck to remake the lost money, maybe their system is comprised, maybe they were not prepared for the influx of volume, whatever the case may be what matters is that currently A LOT of people are missing money and all they are doing is lieing more and more, and theres not a whole lot we can do to hold them accountable ( its cryptocurrency), and it hurts to say, they know it... <br /><br />The forum over at reddit is a variable mass complaint fourm<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c08ju/we_can_trust_bitinstant_again_fyi_bitinstant_is/<br /><br />^ this is a lie tho, I think a poor attempt by someone who is close w/ BI. <br /><br />As well as the official Bitinstant Support Bitcoin forum at<br /><br />&nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.0<br /><br /><br />To save you the reading (but with the provided sources) you can see the droves of individuals listing full account details, transaction dates, funds transferred looking for help and then the Bitinstant Support Techs lieing about &quot; Manually Pushing Thru&quot; their transactions. They are trying to save face but it may be too late...<br /><br />Sorry to hear this, anyone else know a good cash to mtgox route, and how is Mtgox these days? <br />

				Guys, thank you for the responses and the reading sources. Can I really take this to BBB? Dude, would you mind Pming me, or even posting here for others, about how you went about that process? It just sucks that all I can do is try to take business away from them by bitching and complaining here, but it is what it is. I didn&#039;t know there were so many other people with the same problem, though I suspected they were abandoning ship in some way . The tone of the replies, and their passing me off to the CEO over a coupon code just wreaked of bullshit. If I lost one of my customers money, the first thing I&#039;d do is apologize a hundred times, second would be to GET THEM THEIR FUCKING MONEY!!!&nbsp; I mean, it&#039;s as simple as reissuing me a fucking code that works. Done . Bam. 5 minutes. THAT is how I know I&#039;ve been robbed. Anywho, thank you all for any help you&#039;ve been able to give. I&#039;ll update as necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;I also suggest BITFLOOR.COM for those with a bank of america available.

				I think this huge influx of bitcoin purchasers made them feel it was their chance to take advantage of people. <br />Hopefully your case works out for the better.

				I awoke this morning to find that BI has finally processed my funds . I&#039;m a little disappointed that I was still charged BI fees and that I know have to pay $100 per btc rather than the $85 it was if my deposit had been processed correctly. Oh well, I&#039;m happy to finally have my money. <br />&nbsp; To anyone with bitinstant trouble, follow this thread:&nbsp; &nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.5400<br /><br />&nbsp;Thank you to the SR forum member who pointed me to it. Not sure if I&#039;d have gotten my money back without you. New deposits with BI appear to currently have about a %25 chance of failure, according to their support rep.
