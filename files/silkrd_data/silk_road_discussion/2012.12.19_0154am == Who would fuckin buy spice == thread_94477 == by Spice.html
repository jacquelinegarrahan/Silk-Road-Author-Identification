				You must really hate spice to create an account named after it&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />A close friend of mine tried it and said it&#039;s not worth a single penny as the effects are quite short-lived and it requires a shit load of actual herb to get high. He said as well the buzz is nothing compared to the real deal, probably have something to do with other cannabinoids other than THC in the buds...

				Synth-cannabanoids are bad juju for me. Full-agonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors can do serious damage to your health, and while marijuana is only a partial agonist and does not activate some of the dangerous sites that full-agonists do.<br /><br />However, I have smoked them. Dissociated me to all hell, like a ten minute robo-trip. Then I was paranoid as fuck for a long time. I&#039;ve also had some friends of mine in dry areas smoke it consistently and get severely addicted to it, having to smoke 10 - 15 times a day to not have a mental breakdown. Not compulsed to smoke. They felt like they HAD to smoke, like a genuine physical/mental addiction.<br /><br />That being said, I don&#039;t bust anybody for their chosen drug. But I don&#039;t like cannabis in general, so it&#039;s whatever to me.

				I&#039;m not a fan of spice myself but I would use it if I had to avoid detection from my employer or something... I&#039;m not sure what bashing it on the forums is meant to accomplish though.&nbsp; Are you just really concerned that some of your fellow travelers are going to hurt themselves with it?&nbsp; Or are you a bud vendor trying to up your sales?

				This thread has actually had the opposite effect on me- I had never really heard of spice before but am a prolific stoner.<br />I really want to try some now.<br />Does it actually get you stoned like weed? I always thought all those smoking blends were just a rip off/scam.<br /><br />

				Infact the only time I have ever heard of a &quot;synthetic&quot; THC substitute was a few years ago, they found something they could extract from Sea Urchin&#039;s - or another similar nasty sea bearing ball of nastiness.<br />Any of these chemicals in spice come from that?<br />

				There is a multitude of different synthetic cannabinoids. I&#039;ve only tried JWH-210 and it&#039;s very long-lasting and rather trippy. It felt kinda like when I smoked Super Silver Haze for the first time.

				Ugh,<br /><br />Imho spice is for underage kids who can&#039;t get hands on the real thing(real thing being weed)(and because you all have the ability to buy from this website, I don&#039;t have any idea why would anyone buy this...)<br /><br />That said, I had the MOST intense(creepy) experience EVER, with some spice, called Alien Inside(Ik the brands differ GREATLY, but I&#039;ll always remember that name).<br /><br />First of all, it didn&#039;t feel like anything like the name would suggest, but I did start lucid dreaming(I have to admit, I smoked a lot of it), but before that I had the time to have a full blown panic attack. Was still a kid at that time and didn&#039;t have much experience with &quot;bad trips&quot;.<br /><br />So well, we smoked it out of a bong in a bathroom, my friend had this wonderful idea to &quot;hotbox&quot; this substance that we didn&#039;t know....<br />Well the effects were rather instant, but with maybe ~1min delay, so I took about ~10 hits from the bong(oh I wanted to clarify, this was because it took about 15-20 hits to get high from the last batch that we bought) then I stood there in the bathroom, everything was alright and once I came out of the bathroom, the hits kind of started stacking.<br /><br />&nbsp;At first I was laughing my ass off, but then I felt like this was (way)TOO much. Music started stabbing me, people around me had the worst faces, then when I went to the other room to lay down, the last hits were starting to stack on me and I started to ask for my friends, I asked them to call the ambulance and a doctor and my dad and what-not. (thankfully none of them did as I asked, actually I don&#039;t know if thankfully, I mean, if something would&#039;ve happened to me and they would&#039;ve just been: &quot;Oh he&#039;ll just pass-out&quot; then I could be dead atm, but wtf is this rambling) So I laid down and I went to this lucid dream state, where I started walking towards this big gazebo, it was all winter-y and I felt my legs and arms were cold. <br /><br />I continued to walk towards it, but every time I walked towards it, it backed the same length as my step was. So I tried running, still with no luck. Then I was like &quot;Oh fuck this, I&#039;ll walk the other way&quot;, but when I turned around, there was like a forest that you see in horror movies and I could see red eyes glowing and someone moving there and then I was like: &quot;FUCK NO!&quot; and then I thought I&#039;d just run to the gazebo again and it&#039;ll be alright, but when I turned around, all I saw was a burned down building and it was being swallowed by the forest, then the forest started closing down on me and everything that was in the forest started coming after me, I couldn&#039;t really make out what was &quot;hunting&quot; me, but it wasn&#039;t nice.<br /><br />At that point I was panicking, thinking about life, thinking about parents, friends etc etc. Then I faced the fact that I was going to die, and made peace with it and then closed my eyes so I could die, but before I could&#039;ve I passed out and I woke up the next morning.<br /><br />tl;dr: I had a really shitty experience after smoking some &quot;high grade&quot; spice.<br /><br />But after all that, I had an enlightening experience and I really was ready to die at that point, but that experience scared me the fuck away from doing spice EVER again.<br /><br />I hope this was a &quot;fun&quot; read and you&#039;ll never do spice.<br /><br />I wish you all the very best!<br /><br />~~sitamaja<br /><br />**I just wanted to add, spice was really easily accessible, you&#039;d call a number and some guy would deliver it to you with a car, lol.

				The one thing that weirded me out the one or two times I&#039;ve smoked spice is that it tasted so good... like flowers, but chemically sweet. It was gross and good in a strange way. But I&#039;m sensitive to cannabis anyway, it makes me anxious with normal fucking weed. So the paranoia from spice was off the scale and I wound up getting dissociated from it, almost to the extent I had been dissociated from DXM before. Twas scary.
