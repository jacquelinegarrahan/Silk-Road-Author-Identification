				You know you can mine that 0.2 or whatever BTC if you have a half decent video card.<br /><br />It might take a day or two, but it&#039;s better then begging the forums for handouts.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite easy to do to, just download a miner such as phoenix 2 (though there are many others) and join a mining pool such as deepbit.net (again there are many other&#039;s).<br /><br />I&#039;m not talking about mining for profit here, just to get that fraction of a BTC that you need.&nbsp; I have a box that was just sitting around collecting dust, so I threw a 6870 in there and let her chug out the hashing 24/7 and make a modest amount of BTC from it (I know, I know, the cost of electricity, but many people rent, and many people&#039;s rental agreement is inclusive so they can use as much electricity as they want for free).<br /><br />Anyways just some food for thought, constantly new users coming on the forums asking for a fraction of a BTC, well it&#039;s quite easy to achieve yourself if you do a day or 2 of mining.

				Good advice... I run CGMiner and use the bitclockers pool, myself.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Just letting my system run when I&#039;m not using it generates me a BTC every 6 days... not something to quit my job over, but I look at it as free drug money. :D

				This is great advice. Do we need to be concerned about anonymity? What information gets reported to the pool servers? Can we connect to the serves through TOR? What does it know about my local machine? Will I take a performance hit if I run it on a LiveCD? Is this even possible?<br /><br />I&#039;d love to use my burly graphics card to occasionally drum up the odd satori. At 6 BTC a month (as oban_18 says he makes), that means I never have to pay for my monthly half gram of generic desoxyn again!&nbsp; My video card has been feeling so unloved since I gave traded gaming for recreational drug use, so hopefully this will cheer it up a bit.<br /><br />And seeing as how just this evening II was seriously considering asking a good samaritan for the 0.5BTC to complete an order on some of Lim&#039;s new meph, this is personally relevant to me!&nbsp; #WINNING

				yeah I&#039;ve been mining for a while now.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the actual act of mining is a big anonymity concern.&nbsp; You just want to hide the fact that it was *you* who performed the transaction, not so much as it was you who mined the coins.&nbsp; So tumble them once they are mined.&nbsp; As it is, when you mine for a pool, the BTC end up going to the pools wallet, which later sends your payout to your wallet.&nbsp; Your wallet should be &quot;far enough away&quot; from your SR account, regardless of how you get the coins.&nbsp; <br /><br />But the mining is nice.&nbsp; I never, really never, had to worry about coming up short.&nbsp; I mean it doesn&#039;t support my habit completely, but it gives me a nice buffer to use, so the stuff I do buy is much much cheaper than it should be.

				You know that moment in &#039;Crocodile Dundee&#039; when the mugger pulls out a knife, and Dundee says, &quot;That&#039;s not a knife, THIS is a knife!&quot; as he pulls out his machete?<br /><br />I finally showed up to the BTC mining party, fashionably late, as always, and was like, &quot;Hey guys! I&#039;m ready to earn some extra coin with my fancy GPU! Check out my 35Mhash/s style, losers!&quot; And they were like, &quot;That&#039;s cute, was that the secret prize in this morning&#039;s Fruity Pebbles box?&quot; When suddenly, seemingly from thin air, one of them produces an AMD 5830, and swings it above his head like some sort of Neanderthal war-hammer. I saw his eyes roll back in his head, and heard him shout, &quot;302Mhashes/s you n00b!&nbsp; and, well, I just got out of there as fast as I fucking could, because I sensed extreme danger, and also because It&#039;s hard to think of a more humiliating headline than:<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;Local Man Killed By High-End Graphics Card-Wielding Bitcoin Miner.&quot;<br />ANYTOWN, USA -- Friends say the victim, Mr. Searstower&nbsp; was attempting<br />to acquire a small number of &#039;Bitcoins&#039;, a new, decentralized, digital currency<br />rapidly gaining favor in certain internet communities. Wittnesses say that<br />Mr. Searstower approached the two men, Mr. James Smith, 19, and Franco<br />Francesco, 22, as they waitied for a northbound T39 bus. Witnesses watched<br />on in horror as Mr. Smith quickly produced a rectangular box, later identified <br />as an &#039;ATI Radeon HD 5830 Graphics Processor&#039;, liifted the unit high in the <br />air, and brought it down squarely on Mr. Searstower&#039;s head. The assailant<br />continued to beat the victim, seemingly aware of neither Mr. Searstower&#039;s<br />lack of consciousness, nor the growing pool of blood surrounding his<br />unmoving body. When APD arrived at the scene of the crime, Officers<br />encountered Mr. Smith standing over Mr. Searstower&#039;s body, holding<br />the bloodied graphics hardware close to his chest. Looking down at<br />Mr. Searstower, Mr. James said softly, &quot;That&#039;s 1.792TeraFlops of<br />processing power, BEFORE I overclock it. Who&#039;s the loser now?&quot;<br />Mr. James surrendered without incident, and currently being held on<br />$250,000 bond. Porsecutors have made it clear that they will pursue<br />a first-degree murder charge, and ask the judge for the death penalty.<br />Police are still unclear about what precipitated the attack, and any<br />witnesses who believe they may be of assistance are encouraged to call<br />1-800-POLICE, and speak with a detective.
