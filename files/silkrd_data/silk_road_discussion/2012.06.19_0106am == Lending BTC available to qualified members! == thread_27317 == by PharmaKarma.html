				It&#039;s a greta idea and I actually recently used it. Was better than going on Forums and begging for Coins. However, I still think there are Bigger Fish to Fry here on SR. Being able to give personal Feedback on Buyers is just one of them.

				I am for sure interested. I have a vendor account that has 28 transactions with 100% feedback and a buyer account with about $1000 in purchases and no refunds.<br />Is your sr name the same are your forum name?

				I need you to lend me 100000 Bitcoins! I will pay back in one year at a 10%rate. <br />That would be a very good business to you since by then 1bitcoin = 50 dollars<br /><br />do we have a deal? xD lool<br />

				I&#039;m interested, at what level would the interest increase in relation to amount of time in order to pay back (in my specific case)<br /><br />So 1 week its 10%, how about 2/3/4 weeks?<br /><br />It&#039;s just sometimes I think i&#039;ll get the cash in a week, but then it takes a while longer And I wouldnt wanna take out a loan and then end up having to pay 100% on top of that cause mtgox fucked me around or something so I&#039;d rather hedge my bets and go for a longer agreed deadline time
