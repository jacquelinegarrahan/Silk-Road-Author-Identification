				I didn&#039;t receive a PM from them, it definitely sounds like a scam or really poor advertising judging from the crappy intro. How do they have such an intimate knowledge of your buying habits? Looks like a primitive version of BMR that has just been set up recently. It hasn;t been fully developed so it wouldn&#039;t really take a lot for them to pull out and leave you high and dry. No offense if they are reading this.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				This might be a dumb question but... Why doesn&#039;t/wouldn&#039;t SR just steal the auction idea if it takes off? I don&#039;t see how a site could legitimately compete with SR if it uses a new idea instead of upgrading what SR has(kind of like Atlantis but on a larger degree). Because of the free market and illegality of it all there&#039;s nothing to stop DPR from just stealing ideas such as this one, which I actually kind of like and am interested in seeing how it plays out.<br /><br />Is this guy just doomed from the get go?
