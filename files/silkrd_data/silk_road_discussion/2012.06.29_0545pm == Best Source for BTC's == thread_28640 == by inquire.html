				When you&#039;re on the SR website, look down the menu on the left. <br /><br />Click on the link that says &#039;Money&#039;. <br /><br />You should figure it out from there by clicking on the different vendors etc. ;)

				Bitinstant&gt;MtGox&gt;Instawallet&gt;SR optionally you can also use Bitcoin Fog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion) to further your anonymity. A simple google search should answer most of your questions, but if you need any more help feel free to pm me. Bitinstant is pretty straightforward, you bring money to a bank and come home to find it on MtGox. =D

This site just happens to use it as currency. You go to your account on SR and it will tell you a string of letters and numbers to send bitcoins to. So what you do is make a deposit with bitinstant, coinapult it to your email, then send the coins you get to your sr account.<br /><br />If anyone wants to explain it better go ahead
