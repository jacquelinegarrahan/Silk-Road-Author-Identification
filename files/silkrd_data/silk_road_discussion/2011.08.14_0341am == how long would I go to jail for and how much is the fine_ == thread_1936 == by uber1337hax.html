				Yes, he was kidding. No one could give you a definite answer based on the information you gave us (we don&#039;t even know what country you&#039;re in.)<br /><br />I recommend you read this: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ce/2ce_law.shtml<br /><br />In my opinion, if you&#039;re in the US I do not think you&#039;d serve any time in jail for a &quot;small&quot; amount of 2C-E.

				&quot;Officer, I have no idea who sent me this. I did not buy it and it is not my fault someone decided to send it here. You have no proof of my breaking any law.&quot;<br /><br />Or<br /><br />&quot;Officer, this is a plant food. I use it to feed my rose bushes - look, see how healthy they are? What do you mean it is a drug? Why would I want to eat plant food to get high? You are crazy.&quot;<br /><br />Or<br /><br />&quot;I want to talk to my lawyer.&quot; *silence*<br /><br />Or<br /><br />&quot;Please officer! I&#039;ll do anything! Just let me go and I promise never to do it again!&quot; [Not recommended] <br /><br />Or<br /><br />&quot;Fuck off pig!&quot; *fires round after round of .38s into the officer&#039;s belly, trying to avoid getting blood on your new shoes* [Really not recommended]<br />

				best thing is to talk to a lawyer! I have done 2 years and it isnt the worst thing but is a huge waste of time. Think of Casey Anthony, she won her trial because the jury was confused.&nbsp; How would some shit bag District Attorney convince a jury what 2CB was and what your intentions where. As for a lawyer, get one right away and go to trial (chances are during jury selection the DA will give you a deal of no jail time)&nbsp; think of the average juror they will get confused hearing about some research chemical and see reasonable doubt.&nbsp; if you have no record you wont do jail time the prisons are packed (if your in america)

This is all if Wikipedia is to believed, however.<br /><br />Honestly, if you&#039;re in the US, I don&#039;t think anything would happen. If you&#039;re in Europe you might get a fine since it&#039;s illegal in some countries there, but nothing too major.

				you kill me, Envious. To the OP. 1. It all depends on your past criminal history. Was your weed conviction a misdameaner? Most likely it was. Plus your 17, unless they charged you as an adult it will be sealed. 2. Most authorities are not going to worry about personal use of almost anything.&nbsp; Unless your buying ounces or huge orders the worst thing that is going to happen is that they talk to you. In that case, keep your mouth shut! &quot;I dont know what your talking about officer&quot; or speak to my attorney. If your not under arrest, they obviously don&#039;t have enough evidence. 99 percent of offenders talk themselves right into prison..<br /><br />Just make sure you always have a few thousand dollars for bond or get in touch with a bondsman now, just in case they come in with their swat team. Oh, also make sure that you have a&nbsp; good criminal defense attorney on retainer. <br /><br />

				In most states 2C-E is not even illegal.&nbsp; And no federal prosecutor is going to waste their time on an Analog act prosecution on your very small amount. They are mostly concerned with mass distributors.&nbsp; Most likely nothing is going to happen to you even if you are caught receiving 2C-E unless there are some extenuating circumstances like you are giving it to people who have no idea what they&#039;re doing and OD and end up in the ER or generally causing problems for local law enforcement.
