				However in these cases I think that those buyers somewhat deserves it. For hell&#039;s sake how are you REALLY going to FE for a new vendor for 100g MDMA? Just because the price seems a dream (and it was, as it is obviously always the case) it doesn&#039;t mean that you have to leave your brain aside. <br /><br />As much as I hate scams and who does them (people without dignity are the plague of the world) some people really deserve it so that maybe they will start using their brain a little more in the future. It seems like certain people when drugs are concerned lose all sense of proportion and intelligence and this is indeed very sad.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry for the guys that got scammed but I really hope that this will serve them somewhat to make them learn that you should approach business with drugs with the same detachment and professionality that you use with things you care less about.<br /><br />EDIT: If those that give -1 for what I said would openly say what they think I said wrong I would be interested to hear that. Maybe you are one of those that got scammed and you somewhat think that I was harsh in saying that you did deserve it? I&#039;m sorry but you DID, because you disconnected your brain just because you saw your drug at unbelievable prices. Moreover the fact that you give -1 without saying anything at all shows much probably that you are also a coward.

				I just finished posting in another thread regarding vigilance, the more people who report this stuff up the faster the admins can act, thanks for spotting it nanpa but seriously why do people FE on such large orders, people need to be less seduced by something that has scam written all over it and think more objectively about their orders. <br /><br />

Survival of the fittest. Those people who FE on ridiculously obvious scams? Yeah, they were born at the inferior end of the gene pool obviously. Sometimes the only way to get rid of the scammers is to get rid of the scammable. The more fuckwits who fall for that shit the more scammers are attracted to this place. Maybe we just need the scammable to bleed out entirely, lose faith in this place, and leave. I know that&#039;s what I want at this point. I seriously can&#039;t understand the stupidity of others sometimes.

				Now thats what Im talkin about, Lots of people on this forum wanting to help and stop scammers quickly, This was some impressive action.<br />This thread was started 15 hrs ago, I dont know how long that vendors page has been shut down fro(from the OP) but I just tried the link to take a look and it just brings me to a page to send a message to him, which I have experienced before when trying to go to a banned vendors site!!<br />We need to keep this action up, PM the Mods, Start new threads etc. lets shut these fuckers down<br />

				I reported him to inigo, and inigo immediately revoked his vendor privileges.&nbsp; It would have happened sooner, I&#039;m sure, if others had reported the vendor as well, but with only a few transactions, he was just kind of slipping beneath the radar until this thread.&nbsp; It was the first mention I had seen of the vendor, in fact!
