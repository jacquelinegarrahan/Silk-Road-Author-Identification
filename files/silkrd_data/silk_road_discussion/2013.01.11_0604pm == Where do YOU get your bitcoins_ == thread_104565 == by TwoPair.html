				I have recently gotten fucked over because i forgot my pin, put in the pin 5 or 6 times and now i can&#039;t order even though i remembered my pin.<br /><br />SO, i want to know where YOU guys get bitcoins &amp; how fast is it? I want to order again as soon as possible (with a different account). My method was bank transfer, which took like a good week..

				Not trying to put BTC vendors out of business here, but this is what I do.&nbsp; <br /><br />BitInstant is damn fast.&nbsp; It uses MoneyGram bill payments to process cash deposits from different locations--I use Walmarts because they don&#039;t ask for ID, so I can use a fake name, but it doesn&#039;t matter because I mix my coins anyway, so a real name wouldn&#039;t incriminate me.&nbsp; The coins are sent to my wallet literally before the receipt even prints at Walmart.<br /><br />Downsides are that they have a $500 a day limit (I think per person, or per destination, not sure on that detail), and the exchange rate is a bit higher than you might get if you went through the exchange yourself.

				Does anybody have any better ideas other than moneygram through bitinstant. Bitinstant has completely changed from when i was using it, it was nice and easy to use now it is a complete pain in my ass. if i am missing something here please let me know because they are doing a lot of information gathering that makes me nervous. i will not go back to bitinstant, anybody have any other ways to go from cash to BTC, and don&#039;t say moneypak vendor i&#039;m not doing that either i would rather give my name, ip, phone number and a voice recording of myself to bitinstant and moneygram&nbsp; than do that moneypak silliness. I&#039;m not going to do it, jesus is there a convenient anonymous way to get BTC anymore?

				WARNING... don&#039;t buy bitcoins through this forum, there are a lot of scammers ,&nbsp; Virmex is one. Beware of sellers that are offering them at significantly lower than the market price, your money will disappear.

I must have spent two hours talking to people before I settled on one :) And now its awesome, I can get them when i want, straight away (unless he&#039;s at work) under the market price and we verified each other with google/ google chat. Just be really careful on the site above ^_^
