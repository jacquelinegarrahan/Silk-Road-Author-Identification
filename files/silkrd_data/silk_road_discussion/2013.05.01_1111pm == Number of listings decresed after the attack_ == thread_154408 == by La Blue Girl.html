				So I noticed a little bit ago that there are fewer and fewer listings on the road.. <br /><br />Is there something wrong? <br />Have venders just started to pull listings?<br />Is the system not all back online yet?<br /><br />For &quot;ALL&quot; drug listings I only have 8,133 items showing world wide <br />For &quot;Domestic &quot; (USA) that number is only 2,814<br /><br />Before the road went down there were well over 16,000 items in JUST the Cannabis&nbsp; category<br /><br />Is anyone else seeing this?

				My guess is many vendor accounts went into vacation mode during downtime, thus no listings visible

				All my favourite vendors&#039;s listings has gone down in numbers but that is most likely due to them running out of stock I guess!

				There was an official message that went out to all vendor reminding us that if you don&#039;t login for three days you are automatically put into vacation mode, which explains why the decrease of listings on SR. After you set yourself back into active mode your listings show up but it seems to take a little while before your vendor ranking and the ranking for your items is back.
