				I don&#039;t have a tech solution but from a simple business standpoint it&#039;s rather simple. Buyers/vendors DON&#039;T do business on competing sites.

LE would&#039;nt want to keep DDoSing the site forever. Remember, a DDoS just renders the site in a state of paralysis by clogging it. It doesn&#039;t &quot;destroy&quot; it. The second a DDoS stops, the site goes back up. So LE would not employ such a tactic. Am I the only one that realizes this?

Who has the most to gain? Follow the money trail. <br />BUT, if we DO NOT flinch and buy/sell anywhere else... eventually the attacker will give up when their plan proves a waste of resources and time. <br />Please people.. think about it. Contact your trusted vendors and figure it out with them if need be. But KEEP YOUR BTC OFF COMPETING SITES.

				It would be possible, but you have to count in that the I2P Network is alot smaller then the Tor Network, so if you are SR itself use a secure VPN to save the server location another time, something payed with bitcoins for example, probably even clever routing to protect the real server location.<br />For Vendors i would do the same, lots of howtos would have to be written, I2P is geekready, but nothing else.<br /><br />I still say instead of that just fuck LE and everyone else in the internet in the face, we have enough forces in the net that are capable of protecting server locations even in the clearnet. And i doubt that anyone at the cyberbunker team would refuse to host the biggest online-drug market, aslong as its drugs only.<br /><br />If you doubt that ... why is the piratebay still running you think ?

				Its an idea I2P is newer than tor so not as much research has been done. It is also a bit faster and harder to attack from a DDOS stand point. Tor client is ran with C while I2P is ran using Java so the I2P has a bit more of a memory footprint than then Tor. I2P is a closed network so unlike Tor where exit nodes can connect you to clearnet sites on an I2P client it would be rather hard to get it to connect to clearnet sites.Fun Fact I2P is used a lot for&nbsp; aynoumus torrents.

				As far as the SR web server and its wideband connection are not seemed to be bottlenecks there is an opinion about the SR tor connection full of DDoS shit only. Thus I can offer the next scheme:<br /><br />http://p36m5hd45u2xtdyg.onion/1.jpeg

				i have not much clue but im quite sure LE are not allowed to launch ddos attacks. afterall the server could be hosted by a legit company who is not responsible for dprs actions. Like attacking the mother when the son do criminal things. its not gonna happen in a legal world. I for myself have a strong feeling the russians are behind this attack. Atlantis would be the most obvious explanation. To keep their heads out of the crosshair it is a good idea to make an official statement which declines the truth. Does that make them more trustful? Not in my opinion. If there was a ddos attack in the hacker scene for the past few years, i guess 90% of these attacks came from the russians. Now a russian market place opens its doors and all of the sudden the biggest competitor gets a ddos attack. way to obvious if you ask me.<br />
