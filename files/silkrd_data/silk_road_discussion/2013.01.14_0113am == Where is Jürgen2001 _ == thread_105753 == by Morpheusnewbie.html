				I&#039;m a little concerned about said seller?<br />Wanted what order but nothing happened. Status still processing!<br />I asked what&#039;s wrong, but Jürgen was no longer online and answered no questions, now he is completely gone, offers no more of him.<br /><br />He was caught maybe I hope not because I sent address<br /><br />How should I act now if he was caught?

				Morpheusnewbie, how long has your order been in processing? After 4 days&nbsp; you can cancel the order.<br /><br />Did you encrypt your address to him?

				So I canceled the order on day 4 or 5 also. earlier, I had also written to the seller that I cancel the order if there are no more feedback.<br /><br />I then lost by the cancellation 0.6 x Bitcoins, guess because the offer was hedged and the price was lowered to 0.3 to 0.4 during the order Bitcoins I think no idea how it works<br /><br />Even the stupid because you always lose some money even though no performance is achieved.<br /><br />Yes, the address would be encrypted with PGP.<br /><br />
