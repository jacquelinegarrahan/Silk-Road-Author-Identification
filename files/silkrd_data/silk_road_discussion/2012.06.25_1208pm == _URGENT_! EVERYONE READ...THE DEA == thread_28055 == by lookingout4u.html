				I wanted to warn you guys-someone placed an order with me yesterday, and another today. Yesterday was &quot;their first time on SR (although they did have no purchases)&quot;. Something seemed fishy - you&#039;ll see what I mean below. <br />*dialogue*<br />New to SR, first purchase.<br /><br />Hi I&#039;m new and i would like to make my first purchase with you. Shh, don&#039;t tell anyone but I need a clever disguise for when I buy bitcoin and when I&#039;m surfing the underbelly of the net. Your disguise kits seem like the best bet. No one will every recognize me again. Wahhahahahaha!<br /><br />In all seriousness I&#039;m new, and I would like to make a small purchase first. I have already obtained bitcoin and i think I know how to use encrypted communication. Before I click the buy button, will you let a first time user buy from you. Do you use encrypted communication? (so i can test if i know I&#039;m using it right and for general safety)<br /><br />Thank you for your time, and any tips would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />*end*<br />That I was surprised to see. Then today they place another order-even more surprised. So much so that I did some investigating. First of all, their username was &quot;newzeryame&quot; - I mean, come on. Further research brought me to realize there was a DEA only miles away from &quot;their address&quot; in Huntsville, AL. AND THEN I check the address - it DIDN&#039;T EVEN EXIST. <br />Thank god I sent nothing. <br />Everyone else, PLEASE be on your toes regarding this...its scary.

				i can&#039;t see what the problem is? most, if not all, vendors package their product as carefully as possible - no fingerprints no DNA (hair strands) in product etc etc. if they don&#039;t they bloody well should for obvious reasons. in that respect - so what if you send something to the DEA? how do you know you already haven&#039;t? <br /><br />i think the only odd thing about that was a n00b not asking if n00bs need to FE.<br /><br />did you take the guys money? i&#039;d have sent it anyway - not your problem if the donut can&#039;t even write his address properly - you&#039;ve kept your part of the deal.<br /><br />why the throwaway account for posting this?

				I&#039;m less than ten miles from an FBI field office, and the State Police are just down the road from me. I&#039;m glad vendors don&#039;t refuse to ship to me just because I live in (outside of, really) a major city that also happens to have some LEA offices in it.<br /><br />It sounds to me he&#039;s just a stupid Alabama redneck who got tired of having to blow his uncle to score some meth. Seriously though, follow your gut. Just give him some vague excuse for canceling the order
