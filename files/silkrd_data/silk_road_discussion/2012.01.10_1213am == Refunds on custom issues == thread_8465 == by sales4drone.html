				Sales4drone here.<br /><br />I have one quick question for the mods/vendors.<br /><br />If a product was bought and then stopped at customs in the buyers country, what are the refund policies to this?<br /><br />How do other vendors go around this problem?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				It&#039;s expected the vendor offers at least a partial refund, since it was their fault the product didn&#039;t make it through customs.

				Yea we would offer some sort of discount of 2nd orders and partial refunds. But I would like to know what is the SR rules on this? is it compulsory to offer a FULL refund?<br /><br />Also if some one put in a charge back (saying they didn&#039;t receive anything) for us to win the &#039;case&#039; (like ebay) do we have to offer a proof of postage receipt?

				A lot of sellers here choose to ship with DCN just because they can prove the item was delivered and the buyer can&#039;t claim they didn&#039;t receive it.

				My policy is to replace seized orders, since 99% of my orders go through customs somewhere, and I need my clients to feel confident in ordering. I figure if I do my job properly, it shouldn&#039;t come up often enough to worry about. <br /><br />My seizure policy: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Any orders stolen by customs will be replaced and re-shipped at absolutely no charge to you. It&#039;s not your fault if the thieving bastards intercepted your order, and I believe it is my responsibility to package your order stealthily enough to make it to your door. If they steal it again, I will replace it again, once again at absolutely no charge to you. I will not stop until you get your order. I may request that you use a different mailing address for replacement orders. I fucking hate those goddam customs wankers, and want you to be confident you will receive what you pay for.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now, I&#039;ve been doing this for years, and I&#039;m pretty confident in my shipping methods, so replacing an occasional theft by customs is worth it for the goodwill factor.<br /><br />Generally speaking, I think a 50/50 split - a half price replacement - would be a reasonable policy.<br /><br />Whatever policy you do decide upon, you should make it clear in your profile.

				@ sales4drone<br /><br />Your best answer would be to review your potential vendor&#039;s home page. All vendors are different.<br /><br />- ColdFrost

				Thanks for your reply guys. Within EU we are confident that our parcels will get through 99% of the time so here is what I think we are going to do:<br /><br />EU -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full reshipping<br /><br />USA/Asia&nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;50% refund<br /><br />Australia/NZ -&nbsp; 25% refund (people might shy away from this).. We have sold various products to these countries (before sr) and no matter how secure we packaged our orders these countries are very hard to by pass customs it is so much hit and miss :(.<br /><br />What do you lot think?
