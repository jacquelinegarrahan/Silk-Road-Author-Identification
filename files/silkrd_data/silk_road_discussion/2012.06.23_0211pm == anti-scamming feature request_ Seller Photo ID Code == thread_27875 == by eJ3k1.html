				Hello Silk Road,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been browsing through the road and the armory for a while, and I think I came up with a feature to make it more secure. I came up with this to prevent scammers on the armory from making fake listings (like: FE me 800 BTC and I&#039;ll ship you an AK47). However, this could work pretty well on Silk Road too.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it works:<br /><br />Every time a seller account is created, it is assigned a randomly generated unique Seller Photo ID (SPID). This is a small 4-character code containing lower case letters, upper case letters and numbers, something like this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">yK7f</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This code gets randomly generated for each vendor account, and is displayed on the seller&#039;s page. Then, when a seller offers a product, we kindly request that he put op a picture of the product, together with a piece of paper with his SPID written on it (and optionally his seller name/market name, etc).<br /><br />This way, a scammer cannot upload pictures found on the internet, or take pictures from other sellers, and claim that it is his merchandise. So when we see a picture of a product with the SPID, and it matches the SPID displayed on the seller&#039;s page, you can be pretty sure that the seller took the picture (and therefore actually has the offered item in his possession).<br /><br />Like anything, this is not infallible. However it will make many scams a lot harder to pull off.<br /><br />Let me know what you think.

				Most good vendors usually have the product next to their name written on a piece of paper or something, I think that&#039;s fair enough and is easy to tell if it&#039;s been edited in any way.<br /><br />When I saw this thread title I thought you were going to ask vendors to upload pictures of themselves.&nbsp; :o

Your username is not, you are free to choose it. <br /><br />So theoretically, it is possible to look for pictures that contain such a piece of paper on other websites, and then make a silk road account under the same username. Then you will appear to be a good vendor. That would be impossible to do with an SPID code.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27875.msg304804#msg304804">Quote from: sselevol on June 23, 2012, 03:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When I saw this thread title I thought you were going to ask vendors to upload pictures of themselves.&nbsp; :o<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>lol.<br /><br />I added the word &quot;code&quot; to the thread title, hopefully it&#039;s more clear now :p

Using photoshop to create an indistinguishable forgery, that&#039;s a whole different story.<br /><br />Again, I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s 100% fool-proof, but it will make a scammer&#039;s job a lot harder.

				splicing a piece of paper into another simple photo of contraband is something that I could have done perfectly and indistinguishably when I was 12(no hyperbole, I did far more complicated things on photoshop at that age). Have you taken courses in photoshop or read books on it? It really is that easy to do well. and you should have put this in feature request
