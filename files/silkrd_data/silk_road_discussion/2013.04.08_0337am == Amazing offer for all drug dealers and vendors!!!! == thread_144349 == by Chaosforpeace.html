				I have a close friend who owns a large medical cannabis growery. He requires a minimum of 20 pound order.<br /><br />&nbsp;Here is what I&#039;m offering any person who is interested. I have a connection to get some of the highest quality MJ on the planet. I am able to get literally almost every strain that exists.<br />He usually gives me grand daddy purple, kosher kush, super silver haze, bubba kush, and chemdawg biodiesel.<br />You can ask for any strain you want, ill see what I can do.<br /><br />Basically I do not want to go in on this order alone. I can&#039;t afford to shell out 40,000$+ on marijuana. I am offering anyone who wants to get some of the highest quality MJ on the planet through escrow, tell me how much weight you want and tell me how much you want to pay. If you would like tell me a strain specification.<br /><br />The more we buy the cheaper it is, he told me if I buy 100 pounds he might be able to get it under 2000$ possibly under 1500$ a pound. He sells this shit to dispensaries at 5500 fucking dollars a pound all day long. Basically I would create my vendor account and everyone who wants in, would tell me how much they are putting down and I will make a listing for you so you are putting the money in escrow. My friend understands bitcoins and escrow so he is fine as long as he see&#039;s it first hand. All money would be lumped together and we would get whatever the rate is for however much we all put in combined.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to worry about shipping as he has been shipping MJ for years. He only can ship to the United States.<br /><br />I&#039;m clearly not scamming as I offer escrow on this. Also SR support should know that if anything does somehow go wrong everyone gets 100% refund.<br />Please no one try and scam me on this because I&#039;m trying to help people out here.<br />I&#039;m not making anything off of this except for the discounted rate of buying so much for me.<br /><br />If you want in just say so and message me either here on the forums or to my account on SR chaosforpeace. <br />I really hope we can do this.<br />Remember the more you put down, the better the rate.<br />Also the road gets a cut as the whole transaction is on the road.<br /><br />If this works out we can do this again.<br />I will answer any questions you have,<br />Chaos <br />

				&nbsp;No one in the US is paying $5500 a pound anymore.&nbsp; Not even on the East Coast unless you have NO connects and way more money than sense.&nbsp; At 20 lbs. you should be paying no more than $1600-$1700 a lb for indoor on the West Coast.&nbsp; Also, getting 20-100 lbs of indoor, ANY strain, &quot;all grown perfectly.&quot;&nbsp; Sounds highly suspect.<br />

				Ill take a QP of each strain if I can get a LB for 1200-1300<br />But the details of escrow and 100% refund etc. must not change and i would<br />probably only come in on the second order you placed. I suggest you create a vendor<br />account as soon as you can and try to establish some history. <br /><br />I like the price and quality sounds good but im just iffy on the trust factor<br />so convince us a little more.

				You remind me of many people I know IRL. Braggarts who exaggerate the projects they are working on, who always say that their deal is the best thing since sliced bread, who name drop, who give vague or inconsistent details, who when confronted with the details always points to something completely unrelated to support his argument, who are defensive to a fault when confronted about their personality, but I digress. This is your show. If you need me to comment further, feel free to ask me a question.

				You see what all this scamming does!&nbsp; Now lets say he has a genuine offer, or anyone else for that matter!&nbsp; Then just one person claims hes a scammer and boom, there goes his credibility as well as an opportunity for others to get a good deal!&nbsp; <br /><br />Instead of just being lazy and saying, hey this sounds like a scam, why don&#039;t you focus on asking some questions and getting precise details?&nbsp; I think this is the best way to expose the truth from a scam!&nbsp; Throughout this thread I have probably seen one actual question pertaining to the mans offer, the rest are all negative and pointless accusations!<br /><br />And whats wrong with having connects exactly?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that how we all get our shit?<br />

Besides the point I can snag a lb all day for 2300 at most I&#039;m just trying to figure out how that is happening for me locally but with all the people living in legalized states on SR these prices are unheard of?

You&#039;ve lost the trust of this forum a long time ago.

He is like a little kid who comes running into a room and tells everyone he can fly. When a kid does it, you tolerate it, maybe think it&#039;s cute. But when an adult, a business person, a person who claims to be moving 40 kilos of cane, runs into a room and yells out that he can fly, then we can either consider that adult retarded or a dangerous lunatic.<br /><br />Donating to charity? Raz, you are basing your defense of chaosofpeace on his claims he will be donating all his profits to charity? Well I promise to wipe everyone&#039;s feet on the forums. Do I gain some points in your book now? How are you going to verify that he is going to donate to charity? GTFO.<br /><br />Yes I believe that chaosofpeace is a scammer because he is claiming that he has some special connection, that no one else has, that can provide top shelf weed at mexi brick price. How does that make me look? I hope it makes me look sensible and intelligent. I hope it makes me look like a person who understands when someone claims they have a special formula for something, they usually don&#039;t. <br /><br />Now we get to the point where you called me a prick. I could&#039;ve let everything you previously said defending chaosofpeace slide. I could&#039;ve put it off as you are just gullible or greedy enough to fall for the bs chaosofpeace was spitting. But then you had to bring me personally into the attack. I will tell you something Raz. I will be a prick to you when you deserve it. Acting the fool like chaosofpeace? Yes he deserves it. Acting the tough guy and trying to call me out with descriptives I do not appreciate? You will see how much of a prick I&#039;m going to be now. Was my cynicism severe enough for you right there?

				People are apparently attacking you because nothing you&#039;ve so far stated has been backed by any proof. You can&#039;t even accuse me of being a competitor, I sell ketamine, MDMA and meth from the other side of the world our markets hardly even overlap. I couldn&#039;t give a toss if you took over both the weed &amp; coke market and then dropped it to $1 a gram or something. <br /><br />So you&#039;re just going to jump into the large end without proving that you actually have access to anything..? I&#039;m going to repeat that if you want to stop people accusing you of being a scammer just buy a pound or whatever and sell it on in small amounts to build so seller history. If you can&#039;t see that this alone will massively boost your bulk sales you&#039;re either very short witted or a scammer&#039;s credibility is just getting worse. <br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m going to stop posting here because I don&#039;t really care about this to keep posting here.
