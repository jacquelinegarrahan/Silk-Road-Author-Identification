				It&#039;s unfortunate that sellers ask buyers to finalize early. It&#039;s a buyer&#039;s choice to do so, but I&#039;m not going to add to a scammer&#039;s scam by their continuing to operate on SR with my (and others) 5/5 rating left BEFORE we got burned. <br /><br />At this point, my money&#039;s lost, but want to make sure the next person doesn&#039;t make a purchase based on MY feedback. I see no reason why reputable sellers wouldn&#039;t want this to happen as ultimately THEY are the one&#039;s who get burned by scammers <br /><br />There are no shortcuts in SR. Stay w/in escrow and DON&#039;T finalize early!!

				You have a point but nobody decide rating according to 5/5 finalized early text in feedback and I do not see fair to be otherwise - e.g. to give a vendor less then 5/5 if finalized early.<br />You can change feedback at any time but to give any other then 5/5 if its finalized early its unfair to seller ratings.

				Great question asked here. I was also unsure of how to change feedback that is mention in many SR forum posts. Thanks for the education!

I meant to say that its not fair to seller if buyer finalize early and thus give premature lower then 5 ratings.<br />After, of course, giving reasonable time to pass and to receive an order , only then buyer change that feedback accordingly to appropiaite ratings..

				Most buyers&nbsp; won&#039;t sell to us newbies unless we finalize early. What are we suppose to do if we want their product?

				You can try to buy with other seller who does not require early finalize.<br />We ALL started as newbies and without reputation. So its up to you as a newbee without reputation to earn it and that carry some more risk.<br />As a vendor I also have worked to earn my reputation and I can assure you, I was scammed and cheated and lost lot of money on shady people but I know that this is how the game is played and there is no perfect system. Start small and with money what you can lose. You will always have ability to leave feedback what legit and honest vendor will not risk to go down and to scam you.
