				This will be a bit of a contentious issue, fraught with obvious problems, but...&nbsp; &nbsp;What SR needs is a way for trusted buyers to privately sell things to other users.&nbsp; As an example, I have all sorts of little baggies of reagents that I no longer want to dabble in.&nbsp; Things that I don&#039;t have the means to sell to anyone I know.&nbsp; What I would like to do is put it all together in one lot, and then sell it for bitcoins right here on the forum.&nbsp; I am not looking to be a vendor, just looking to get rid of some stuff. <br /><br />I know there are issues.&nbsp; There is no real connection between SR and these forums, there is no safety or escrow or anything else in place for the kind of thing I am talking about.&nbsp; But I do have my standing as a buyer on SR as leverage, my honor to put on the line.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has there been anything like this out there?&nbsp; obviously selling to a vendor would be ideal but of course they would be foolish to expose their mailing address like that.&nbsp; The site itself needs a modest little &#039;mini vendor&#039;&nbsp; section where something like this would be possible.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;&quot;But I do have my standing as a buyer on SR as leverage, my honor to put on the line.&quot;<br /><br />And also the ability to then disappear.<br />&nbsp;<br />Good standing or not i don&#039;t think that would happen in the forums.

				Vendor&#039;s have to shell out $500 to get the privilege of selling on SR. If what you are suggesting happened, it would completely undermine and devalue the vendor privileges. In a nut shell, I don&#039;t think it will ever happen.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents...
