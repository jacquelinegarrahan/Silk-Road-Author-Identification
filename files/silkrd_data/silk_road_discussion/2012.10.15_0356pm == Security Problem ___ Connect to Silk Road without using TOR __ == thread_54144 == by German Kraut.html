				I found this link in the internet.ItÂ´s &quot;Quick Enter to the&nbsp; login site of user accounts to Silk Road&quot;<br /><br />DONT USE IT !!! DO NOT LOGIN, JUST WATCH !!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/index.php/silkroad/home<br /><br />I cant believe that this is a secure way to login to Silk Road without using TOR.For me this sounds just for a way for scammer to hijack and steal your Silk Road Account &amp; Info, or maeby the DEA wants to infiltrate Silk Road with this adress.I dont know ...<br />You can open the login site in a normal Browser without using TOR. Dont use it, just watch ....<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/index.php/silkroad/home<br /><br />Im sure its only created for scammers to steal Silk Road Accounts.<br />Or is it realy working ???? I think NO.<br /><br />Please check it .If this is a security problem please post some warnings ....

				are you serious?&nbsp; i am really confused. you are saying you can access tor sites without using tor? <br /><br />wtf - i mean doesnt that completely negate the entire point of using SR on an anonymous network<br /><br />i dont understand, can someone explain this to me? why would there be a way to get on SR and not be anonymous, wouldnt this compromise the security of the site?

You enter the URL (or better said, the .onion pseudo domain), they go to that hidden service and send the contents back to you, probably through an unencrypted connection.<br /><br />Is it anonymous?... Absolutely not. Don&#039;t use it.

				Everything was pretty much covered above. Just to make it crystal clear, though - the advantage of using Tor isn&#039;t so much just to access &#039;hidden services&#039; as there are several ways to do that without actually using Tor (as well as several ways to set them up SOMEWHAT securely on clearnet). It&#039;s main advantage is masking your location and making any association to you nearly impossible based on your connection.<br />.Hades.

				Well from what i have learned in the last 6 mnths has pretty much been coverd. Also you need to uncheck the JAVA setting in the top tor browser options settings, its under content.. It can from my understanding help give away your location. I piggy back off someone&#039;s wifi and when iv ran the IP it always says the dns is in another state, even on clear net i use cyber ghost to mask my IP sometimes though.... Is this Java information correct fellow member who know a little more about TOR and keeping yourself anonymous?

				You COULD actually leave that setting for Java checked if you are using the TorBrowser Bundle. The reason being is that the TBB is automatically configured to &#039;hook&#039; dangerous java activity; meaning it will catch data that could give away your location.<br /><br />That being said, disabling Java isn&#039;t a terrible idea anyway... if for nothing else than redundancy.<br />.Hades.

				onion.to is a proxy which allows people to connect to SR and other .onion sites through a clearnet browser...however it doesn&#039;t provide the anonymity you get from a TOR circuit...

				Ben you are so right and I think most people don&#039;t understand this.<br /><br />I suspect some people follow links in their normal browsers because it&#039;s much faster, but that one click could get you busted.&nbsp; And it&#039;s very, very easy for someone to setup such a trap.<br /><br />I also think most don&#039;t understand the exit node/clear text limitations.<br /><br />I should probably setup an exit node and look for SR keywords, just to see how many people are risking their lives...<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=54144.msg526297#msg526297">Quote from: BenCousins on October 16, 2012, 02:00 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What i mean is that a honeypot link could be posted on here that could only have been found by people visiting here.
