				DPR .. astor .. and a few others are stroking their beards in silent contemplation... in this thread:<br /><br />Why are so many threads being deleted without explanation?<br /><br />The rest of them are still at jesusOfRave&#039;s good bye party..<br />... free drugs for everyone.. and it&#039;s turned into a bit of an orgy <br />.. it&#039;s been very popular... i&#039;ve got some great pics on my new phone.<br />If you want to see a selection of them.. you have to send me a satoshi (address in my sig)<br /><br />

				You can&#039;t please everyone. The site is running well at the moment yet some people still want to whinge! How about a little gratitude instead. They do volunteer their time.

				I wasn&#039;t bitching or whinging. I was trying to ask whoever saw the thread and felt like replying if they had seen the Mods. I like the Mods, they do a good job and work long hours. They come across articulate and educated, unlike the two specimens of illiterate pond scum who chipped in with their 2pence worth in this thread.<br />+1 Libertas, I just doubled your century!
