				While browsing through the listings I noticed that some sellers have numbers in parentheses next to their names and others don&#039;t.&nbsp; I know that the numbers represent the sellers&#039; percentage of feedback that is positive,&nbsp; but then I noticed that many of the sellers without numbers next to their names have positive feedback as well!&nbsp; Now I&#039;m confused, why don&#039;t these ones have a positive feedback score too?

				You get a rating after 10 completed sales.<br /><br />total feedback %<br />The formula is total points earned (counted in x/5) over total available.<br />4/5 + 5/5 + 5/5 + 4/5 would be 18/20 or 96%<br />while<br />1/5 + 3/5 + 1/5 + 3/5 + 2/5 would be 10/25 or 40%<br /><br />It&#039;s great to have rating though this system has its quirks.<br />The lowest rating is a 1/5 (at least as far a I know) so the lowest is 20% not 0<br /><br />Also a 4/5 might be a good review but is a 20% markdown.<br /><br />Statistically scores are weighted more toward the middle than eBay. 4/5 is a big hit for a &quot;good buy&quot; while 1/5 is lots of points for a ripoff.<br /><br />The listing sorting system is a little odd (Upgrade is on Silk Road&#039;s TODO list). For example GreenCo has over 180 transactions and a 100% rating. But they are displayed BELOW mrnewseller with only 10 transactions because somewhere along the way GreenCo got a 4/5 rating. They system counts them as 99.998% vs the 10/10 mrnewseller has<br /><br />In general the rating is OK but it best to look at what the buyers wrote and how many transactions and the forum.

				To do list?<br /><br />You just add the total number of transaction next to that 100 number he was talking about. /fixed.<br /><br />I&#039;m playing devils advocate, I know you mean more than that is on the list to be improved but seriously. How hard could the total transaction fix be?<br />

				@ClayG<br />part of it is fairly easy, sort by # of transactions. <br />Another project is an algorithm to catch shill reviews (retroactively!)&nbsp; <br /><br />Trying to find the balance between promoting new Sellers for the sake of competition and variety while protecting buyers and also valuing established Sellers for their contributions, reliability and safety is a little complicated.

				I think the only thing that really needs to be added is a few more variables in the &quot;sorty by&quot; dropdown.&nbsp; Total transactions, maybe age of account, maybe most recent completed transaction, etc.
