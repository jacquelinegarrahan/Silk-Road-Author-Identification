				As the subject says -&gt; Question For DPR - Is The Deposit/Withdrawl System 100% Fixed Yet?<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to deposit bit coins into my account but I&#039;m nervous with this recent bug. I can&#039;t afford to have all this BTC lost for days in the system waiting for support, or worse lose it completely.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				Me too. . .I&#039;ll be watching this thread.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been sitting on bitcoins in my wallet and waiting for the forums to clear up.&nbsp; I won&#039;t deposit until I see no more posts about people loosing coins.&nbsp; Yikes, its too scary to make an order without an official go ahead.<br /><br />Looking forward to shopping real soon!

				For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;ve been off the road for a number of weeks and didn&#039;t bother to check the forums before depositing Sunday and my coins came through in about three hours, which is pretty standard for me. From what I can gather it&#039;s only withdrawals that are affected but you could try sending through a tiny amount to test the system if you&#039;re paranoid.

				Thanks for the confidence . <br /><br />Mine always clears SR in about one hr.&nbsp; &nbsp;other people it takes hours and some it takes days?&nbsp; What gives with the differences.&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems like the ones remaining for a resolution are spooking me out.<br /><br />Great advice .&nbsp; Send a bit and wait and see and then send more bit by bit.<br /><br />I&#039;m drug starved.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reality is starting to come clear again and it&#039;s fucking scary!

				People in other threads who were missing deposits have posted that they&#039;ve received their coins and a personal apology from DPR ... so, support is definitely working on things - it may just take awhile now as they have to process it account by account.

				Scurry please post and let us know when/if your issue was resolved and you got your coins.<br /><br /><br />This whole thing makes me nervous. If DPR posted and said he&#039;s aware of the issue and is working to resolve it, I&#039;m sure people wouldn&#039;t mind waiting days for it to get fixed, him just saying that would put people&#039;s mind at ease, it&#039;s the not hearing anything part that&#039;s scary.<br /><br /><br />Last time I deposited bit coins into my sr account was the Sunday before last so 8 days ago, and I placed a order that day with them, everything went fine. Definitely not depositing more until we hear some news, and I want to place a order so that sucks.....

				I am not trying to go off topic and if this is inappropriate for here I apologize in advance. The individual from american bitcoins has asked me to send him coin from my off site account to see if the coins will hit. I do not get the feeling he is trying to steal a coin from me but that could be the very simple fact. What concerns me is that he wants it to come from an account or wallet that is not on the sr, stating that they always make it through. What he wants to see if they will come from an off site wallet. I went with my gut that something just doesn&#039;t seem kosher. Could this have opened me up to extreme vulnerability if I were to have complied with this request or is the paranoid guilt getting the best of me.<br /><br />I do and want to help people but I have to look out for myself first and foremost and at the same time do not want to discourage help among one another. Any thought and opinions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you for your help,

				DO NOT DO IT.&nbsp; He has already submitted messages to support and they WILL get around to fixing it.&nbsp; In the meantime, there is no reason he should be asking others to send him coins.<br /><br />Sorry to be harsh, but don&#039;t do it.

				I totally understand where you are coming from, and I&#039;m also not trying to imply anything negative about the user who made that request.&nbsp; However, at the same time, I am confident DPR will fix the issue for americanbitcoin just like he has for several other members already.&nbsp; No need to get more coins caught up in the issue, and always best to be a little paranoid.&nbsp; :D

				Ok so I just used bitfloor today to aquire some BTC. I did that, then sent it over to SR... SUCCESSFUL DEPOSIT FOR THE RECORD (45 mins from bitfloor to SR). Its definitely a problem within a selective users/transactions.

If you (or the service) pay no transaction fee, it can take over 12 hours to get the first confirmation.<br /><br />Of course, I&#039;m only talking about bitcoin transactions viz the block chain. With SR there&#039;s the further complication that the money in your account has to be added to a separate database under SR&#039;s control, and lots of unknown things can happen to delay that.<br />
