				visa only charges retailers 2.9 - 3.5 % and customers get full money back protection. Better watch out Silk or more and more people will start buying outside of escrow, especially if they are repeat customers and already trust the seller.<br /><br />

				I totally support Silk Road but 5% mandatory was already on the high side. GreenCo donates so it is not the money but I am starting to get worried that prices will put off some customers. <br /><br />My main worry is that a high automatic charge will hurt Silk Road by discouraging purchases or convincing&nbsp; people buy outside of escrow or make competing&nbsp; sites more attractive.<br /><br />I love Silk Road but I want to get them money without hurting the site. What about supporter icons, your profile has an option where you can have a % that automatically gets donated from your offerings or purchases.

				Most complaining I&#039;ve see *offsite* about SR is the price of drugs.&nbsp; A lot of people say it&#039;s not worth the cost, that some sellers double the street price.&nbsp; Whether the fees affect this, or just plain old greed, I&#039;m not sure, but the problem in one area--opiates--is a lack of sellers of the hardcore opiates: dilaudids, consistent heroin.&nbsp; I think a 5 per cent fee is fair, because SR provides a *whole* lot, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that fee that is causing problems...

				i&#039;m a tad confused. Does SR add them to the vendors posting cost? Who pays the 5 percent?. the vendor or the buyer? (I realize that the buyer really does, but if I put up something for 5 bucks will it stay 5 bucks or will it be 5.30 or so?)

				It is added as escrow fee that buyers pay. Most sellers don&#039;t even know it is there unless they check out their own listings while not signed in. There are recent reports that it may be 6.2% or 6.4% <br /><br />GreenCo charges between $50-$60 USD per 1/8 Oz (3.5g) depending on strain.

				The fee is 6.23% last time I checked. <br /><br />I personally don&#039;t mind at all, if it means SR doesn&#039;t have to work a day job and can instead focus on security and feature improvements then it&#039;s money well spent. I can see how it would be a bit much for vendors moving products with lower margins (like weed) however. My only complaint is that it&#039;s not listed anywhere as far as I can tell.

				I also agree it should be something that BUYERS are also aware of (in addition to sellers). I suggest this, because this might make make a transaction more understandable where we ARE paying twice street price. For example, my seller just told me today the margin she/he receives after SR. I was pretty surprised and it explained why she/he charges what she/he does. <br /><br />I mean, is the fee pretty high? Sure. But compared to what? Alleviating the danger of buying drugs off the street, government interference, potential arrest, getting ripped off, etc. I mean, Ebay is a complete rip-off but people still sell their shit there, and make a living.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad to support someone&#039;s living on SR if it means I&#039;m not giving the government any money in return.<br /><br />Just make it known to buyers and sellers.

				I can understand why SilkRoad would charge a fee but I think they should lower it to 3% if possible. The main reason being that I and many other here on SilkRoad have to pay royalties to acquire bitcoins initially. Right now we are looking a net tax of over 10%. Also Bitcoins are not exactly a stable currency yet, and just recently as many of us know our anonymous coins&#039; exchange rate took costly dive. But if it is as 3Jane says, I would rather SilkRoad charge a higher rate. Finally, out of all fairness SilkRoad needs to display their taxation rate on the front page.<br /><br />-Magic<br /><br />

				The most important thing, I think, is A. that the standard fee added to each sale be explained in the buyer and seller&#039;s guides.&nbsp; Not any discounted or otherwise lowered fee.&nbsp; Just the basic one.&nbsp; B. SR, or us as a community, get a FAQ up *quick* about the basics of buying online so we don&#039;t end up with a zillion threads on this forum about all that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone who was on the old SR 1.0 forum knows how many BTC, Dwolla, Mt. Gox, Tor, etc etc etc threads ended up there.&nbsp; It&#039;s so unnecessary with this &quot;simple machines&quot; format.<br /><br />And the rest of it really isn&#039;t any concern of ours, as buyers.&nbsp; SR is still in the experimental phase.&nbsp; As volume grows and some sellers end up being outstanding, it is only natural (and good business) that SR will work out discounted sales programs for them.&nbsp; Those details should never be public because no need to tell the world about vendor volume, SR&#039;s volume, whatever.<br /><br />One thing I do think needs changed pretty quick: showing the transaction numbers on the higher volume sellers accounts.&nbsp; Once a seller hits maybe 100 transactions, it could just say &quot;over 100 transactions, here are the 20 most recent&quot; and show the recent feedback.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t be good to have someone on there showing 5,280 transactions in a 3 month time period, would it? ;)&nbsp; As a seller I&#039;d want that stuff, including all deleted messages and other transaction details, deleted as soon as it was determined that the sale had no problems.&nbsp; The quicker the better.<br /><br />

				I think that as long as no one gets ripped off either from getting their coins jacked or scammed the fees are fair if they are disclosed ahead of time.<br /><br />Yeah the prices are high here.&nbsp; But remember that buyers here don&#039;t always favor price, they favor security and everything else offered.<br /><br />50-60 huh....&nbsp; I&#039;ll peep you at some point.

				I do believe SR should be more up front about the fees involved. So far I am happy with the pricing. I have even donated a few BTC to SR. I want this place to flourish and prosper. A profit must be earned. I get it and support the cause. I am NOT going to complain about it. I strive for excellence and so does SR. Excellence isn&#039;t free. SR is EXCELLENT!!! <br /><br />I have seen many new improvements and am looking forward to new ones. KEEP IT SIMPLE. There are a few great ideas here in this thread. The future looks good. I am glad to be a part of it. <br /><br />Two more things: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want to be ranked number one. :)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do not want the whole community to know my number. :)

				SR is optimized for security and privacy, not price.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to forget that SR is an amazing custom Onion site for new cryptocurrency, with escrow, seller rating system, messaging, order hedging, and well-moderated forum for all kinds of discussions.&nbsp; And those are just the visible parts: as the highest-profile onion site, I&#039;m sure SR has been hardened against hacking &amp; tor-specific attacks, custom internal auditing to catch &amp; resolve any weirdness,&nbsp; external network monitoring, etc.<br /><br />To me, buying via SR for what I can&#039;t find f2f is well worth a 50% premium over street prices, and a 6% cut for SR is not a big deal.&nbsp; I do agree that the % cut should be made clear in the fine print somewhere, though.

Agorism and counter-economics (thank you Sam Konkin) is the only way to starve the beast, like you kill any hard to kill beast-----you cut off it&#039;s lifeline. Namely the central banking system and the forced down our throats currency we MUST accept by law......anywhere but here.<br /><br />The BTC is still way too connected (and dependent) on the phony baloney US$ thought (AAA credit rating....ROTFL) because that&#039;s still what we all convert to (well not all) and do math to convert BTC to while shopping.<br />Oh, did I go off topic?

				SR takes the most risk running this site - a transaction fee is such a small thing compared to that. Just be glad you guys can all now get damn near any chem almost anywhere in the world.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I call (r)evolution.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I can understand why SilkRoad would charge a fee but I think they should lower it to 3% if possible. The main reason being that I and many other here on SilkRoad have to pay royalties to acquire bitcoins initially. Right now we are looking a net tax of over 10%. Also Bitcoins are not exactly a stable currency yet, and just recently as many of us know our anonymous coins&#039; exchange rate took costly dive. But if it is as 3Jane says, I would rather SilkRoad charge a higher rate. Finally, out of all fairness SilkRoad needs to display their taxation rate on the front page.<br /><br />-Magic

				I&#039;m happy to support this place with a fee, let&#039;s just hope it&#039;s not going to hit ridiculous percentage, since the prices are already way too high, in some cases.<br /><br />Long life SR.

				Fair enough to charge a fee, no complaints from me.&nbsp; But, it did dampen my excitement at finding this this place when I saw the prices.&nbsp; The trouble is I&#039;m usually pretty broke so price is definitely an issue for me, not that it will stop me buying, I&#039;ve just got to be pretty selective. It&#039;s a case of buying what I can afford rather than what I&#039;d really like. In the UK finding weed is getting stupidly hard so this place is a godsend.<br />Of course just to piss me off, after I bought bitcoins their value took a nosedive! So there&#039;s even more lovely looking stuff that I can&#039;t afford!<br /><br />Btw, need more UK sellers cos if I run out again I&#039;m going to kill something cuddly.<br /><br />Keep up the good work SR, it&#039;s much appreciated.

All this talk of revolution reads like a &quot;workers party&quot; pamphlet. I agree with what you are saying but on a realistic note: do you actually believe revenues from the Silk Road are going to cause a revolution and thus allow the legal sale of drugs? I feel like so many of these SR forum threads get bogged down with extremist libertarian rhetoric.<br /><br />The fact that SR is here and allowing people like us to purchase illegal items is amazing. This isn&#039;t ebay - SR is taking all kinds of felonious risks and deserves to be compensated. I could understand complaints about high fees if this was in the confines of the law. As has been said by many sellers, for this to be worth it they must charge high prices in order for the reward to be worth the risk.
