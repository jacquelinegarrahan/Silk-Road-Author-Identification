				I ordered $440 of product from a vendor. When product arrived it was much less than agreed upon (I was expecting 2 grams worth, he sent me 140mg worth) and it was bad quality. The vendor admitted that he had made a mistake and said he would ship the rest, but I do not want his product anymore. <br /><br />I want to do a refund, but I do not want my stats and account to be ruined. I received a refund of only $6 a few months ago for shipping on a $50 purchase and this raised my refund rate to .34%. I would imagine that if I received a refund for $400 that this would cause my refund rate to raise significantly. <br /><br />I noticed that most vendors will refuse to sell to anyone with a refund rating of more than 1%. If I get refunded for my $400 order, will my refund rate be so high that most vendors will not sell to me or will require me to finalize early every time? I&#039;d imagine that I&#039;d have to make a new account if I go through with the refund and I believe new accounts are closed to the public at the moment.<br /><br />How is refund rate calculated? If it is important, I have 25 orders on my account and I have spent $2300 total. <br /><br />What is the best way to proceed with this?

				A full SR refund would put you at about 5%-6% refund rate if my mental math serves me correctly.<br /><br />That said it is totally up to the vendor and how he feels about you after the whole deal is done. <br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t want to lose them as a vendor? but you dont like their product. right? I mean whats the point? just curious really.<br />

				I don&#039;t care about losing the vendor that ripped me off. I&#039;m never ordering from them again. It&#039;s the other vendors on SR that I care about. Most profiles I see mention something like &quot;your order will be canceled if refund rate is above 1%&quot; or &quot;must finalize early if refund rate is above 1%.&quot; So if my refund rate goes up to 5% then the majority of vendors on SR will refuse to sell to me or force me to finalize early, correct?

				well if you have already bought from your other venders and have good communication with them<br />you should be fine.. as for finding new venders it might cause u to get treated and have to finalize early ..<br />all the major venders are cool just talk to them tell them what happened before u place ur order and everything should be fine..<br /><br />some might think your a scammer but it just depends..<br /><br />im cool with all my venders i only fuck with like 4 major ones.. and if i have to get a refund from them they just reship or let me order again later after <br />being refunded

				Not that it would make much of a difference but I would ask for a smaller amount to start out next time. Make a smaller purchase just to test. Then verify its the same product when you buy in bulk. I&#039;m a vendor and I personally wouldnt care if you had a bad run in with another vendor as long as it is not an ongoing thing you know. I know there are people out there scamming. Both sellers and buyers.&nbsp; I hope everything works out.

If I get something I like, its 4 days before a repeat order can get here. A lot can happen in 4 days.

Yeah. I would message your fav vendor and say listen....this is the situation. Please dont barr me because this other vendor fucked up my stats. If that vendor knows who you are, then I do not see why they wouldnt just be cool.
