				I ordered a product from overseas that hasn&#039;t arrived yet, but still could be on its way despite the fact that I&#039;ve almost hit the auto-finalize mark. I didn&#039;t want to be forced to finalize early, so I went to the resolution center and requested an extension to ensure the product arrived.&nbsp; Now the due date for the resolution is almost here and the vendor hasn&#039;t responded yet.<br /><br />If it goes to resolution and I get the extension will I be able to request another resolution if it never arrives or can it only go the admins once?<br /><br />I&#039;d rather not request a refund now as it&#039;s still in a possible (albeit on the long side) time frame for the overseas order, but if I won&#039;t be allowed to take it to resolution a second time once the admins step in I will.

				You can propose another time extension if you want and that will give the package a few extra days to arrive. You can keep proposing resolutions as far as I know. If the vendor isn&#039;t responding to any of them, you could ask for a 100% refund on the grounds that you made an effort to resolve the issue and the vendor ignored your requests.

				Make sure you gather all facts that help your case in an orderly fashion and present it in the resolution as many vendors will wait ti lthe last 5 minutes and submit a case that wins them 50% of the resolution. Like a tracking number that proofs delivery orazy number of things, be sure to prove that they have no proof that they tracked the package or even sent it.<br />X)<br />nomad

				ah, tricky and good to know.&nbsp; Thanks for the tip- I wouldn&#039;t have thought of that on my own.&nbsp; Now that I know I can bring it to resolution again later I&#039;m not requesting a refund yet, but I&#039;ll definitely keep that in mind if it gets to that point.
