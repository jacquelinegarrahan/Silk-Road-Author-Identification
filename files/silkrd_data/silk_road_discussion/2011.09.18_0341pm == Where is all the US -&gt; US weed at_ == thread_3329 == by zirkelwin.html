				I&#039;ve been browsing around looking for what I&#039;ll buy after my bitcoins come through. I always go to the weed section and sort by seller rank. Usually there are several vendors shipping from the US to the US. This time however there is just one listing by sellers ranked above TimeTraveler. Most of my regular vendors appear to be active (judging by the &quot;last seen&quot; on their profile), but completely out of product. Is there an underlying reason for this, or is it just random?

				I live in a Cannabis-Friendly state and happy to supply product - if you would like to get a small order to test quality before larger buys, happy to accomodate. I&#039;m sklathill on the SR site.

				random I believe....some have said some sellers have left because of bitcoin volatility but who knows the real reason.&nbsp; &nbsp;Best is to keep checking back....or take a chance on a new vendor.&nbsp; That purple barney does sound nice sklathill and the price is right.<br /><br />Listen to the music is just getting back into it too.....Always quality there.

Only one of them has any herb listed right now though, and he only has one listing.<br /><br />So far I haven&#039;t ventured into ordering across borders, the customs problem worries me. How much more likely are shipments from Canada to be nabbed?

				All the US weed is here, in Canada, stored in a few special places by yours truly.&nbsp; It&#039;s waiting to be shipped right to you, zirkelwin!<br /><br />About 75% of my business is to the US.&nbsp; I have only had 2 packages not make it and I am 100% sure both were scammer buyers who waited until I was on vacation then time-forced the 100% refund.&nbsp; Other than that, peachy keen, and I think you will like my prices too.&nbsp; I even put up pics (finally) the other day :)<br /><br />I would love to do some business.&nbsp; Check through the review thread in my sig as a lot of US buyers post their thoughts on my shipping methods - it&#039;ll get you a better idea of my service.<br /><br />Cheers.&nbsp; I look forward to doing business.
