				I must say that I really commend the SR admins for the work they have been doing to keep this place a safe platform for all of us to use!<br /><br />Recently I got scammed out of $1200.00 by Aakoven and I FE&#039;d (big mistake). The SR admins have now temporarily banned his sellers account until further notice. This just goes to show that they do everything that they can to make sure that we don&#039;t get scammed, especially us newbies on here!<br /><br />On top of all other work that they have to do to keep this place afloat they still manage to communicate in a very timely and professional manner and I respect them so much for this!<br /><br />Thanks guys! You are doing a truly awesome job! Keep it up!<br /><br />Cheers

				So let me get this right. SR admin&#039;s covered up all the post&#039;s and all the warnings on the buyers guide saying not to FE cause then they will have no control over your money just specifically in your case? <br />And of course the SR admins pressed the Finalise buton for you right? Knowing full well that they will have no control of the money once it leaves the escrow system making their job harder. <br />Yes lets all blame the SR admins for our mistakes fuck &#039;em all!!<br />Everyone should finalise early, just like everyone has been saying in every second thread and plastered all over the buyer&#039;s guide!<br />
