				Right, I think people would feel more comfortable with more of a bubble-style envelope packaging.&nbsp; It&#039;s very discreet, you know, the type of packging a CD or a thin book would come in.&nbsp; But ultimately, Keep it safe and un-noticed!

				Hmm.&nbsp; Honestly, you should look on the internet for any and all kinds of &#039;odor absorbent&#039; materials that would eliminate, or absorb the MDMA smell.&nbsp; Woodchips, Charcoal pieces, anything you can pack around the sides to keep a dog away from your letter.

				Roll the MDMA flat with parchment paper or something. Place the flattened M inside a vacuum seal bag that will end up being about 3x3 inches (no more than 3 inches high, doesn&#039;t have to be square. Keep as flat as possible and get a good seal and then trim the edges carefully. Get some 8&amp;1/2x11 cardstock, don&#039;t use regular paper. Tri fold the cardstock carefully to fit inside an envelope, tape the M inside the middle of the cardstock and then tape the folded cardstock up as flat as possible. Place in the envelope and viola! I have received MDMA this way from EU to US many times and when done correctly, you really have to fondle the envelope to tell anything other than the cardstock is inside and the letter will still pass through autosorters with no problem. Remember, letters pass through customs differently than &quot;packages&quot; such as bubble mailers. Letters are considered correspondence and less can be done without a warrant or probable cause to inspect them. Parcels or packages are obviously items and are subject to a less stringent set of rules on what can be inspected, opened, etc..<br />Customs is not just looking for illicit substances, they are also looking for import violations and such, making sure duties have been paid, making sure recipient has an import license if necessary, and so on.<br /><br />oxyhoot

				LSD degrades depending on heat and light (and time exposure to air). At room temperature it degrades faster than at freezing. I would put it in a mini plastic baggie as I&#039;ve seen lsd just wrapped in a letter and part of the design on the blotter rubs off on the paper (and I&#039;m sure some of the lsd). I&#039;ve seen others glue the letter into the envelope. Its also folded so if its started to pull out, only the letter part shows and not the baggie.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve got a big sheet, I store mine in a ziplock baggie with the air sucked out (a ghetto vac seal), and the ziplock bag in my attic where its freezing and in a shoebox where its dark. Wish pubmed had studies on lsd degradtion ;)
