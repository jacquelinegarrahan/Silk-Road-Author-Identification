Seriously the low grade bud i found on silk road is listed for 6 bitcoins per 2 ounce so i really paid alot for about 6 bitcoins worth of low grade. i spend 30 bitcoins on garbage bud . what should i do?

				First you have to try to come to a deal with your seller.<br />Only when you two can not come to a agreement, then you go to the judge and ask your for your money from escrow.<br /><br />You should have read the instructions of dpr.<br />And started to buy with a small amount.<br /><br />If you have ordered the same weed, but did receive a low grade, then you can start a dispute by showing the pictures where the difference is clear.<br />You will get most likely your money back.<br /><br />If your weed is clearly not the weed that is on the picture of the seller, you will (most likely) get your money back.<br /><br />If other people are satisfied you have just a differend taste ot are spoiled with good quality.<br /><br />I want to smell my wee from 8 feet distance.<br />When i start to crush the weed the whole room has to be filled with the smell of weed.<br /><br />I want my weed to be sticky and oily,<br />When my joint went out of fire and I relight the joint I want to see a flame like a candle for at least 5 seconds.<br />Most of the time the flame will die after ten seconds.<br /><br />When a bud is sqeezed it should bounce back and never crumble.<br />Only bad dried weed crumbles.<br /><br />Only the stick in the bud should break,<br />The bud itself should be moisty-like.<br /><br />Buy once a bag of tobacco.<br />&nbsp;Good tobacco is not dry either but a bit moist, so it will roll nicely.<br />Good weed is often fucked by wrong drying.<br /><br />Weed and tobacco should be dried the same way.<br />Slowly and not in just 2 months.<br />3 months is the minimum time to dry between harvesting and selling.<br /><br />Skunk needs 3 and a half month to dry.<br />When you take your time to dry weed, you will have to wash your hands before rolling your joint.<br />Your rolling-paper should stick to your fingers so it will break because of the stickiness of the oil.<br /><br />When weed is propperly dried, you will see the same effect when you squeeze a orangeskin infront of a flame of your lighter.<br />Sparks should burst out very now and then out of your joint.<br /><br />But sadly most growers dry their weed within 3 weeks and sell it for almost half the price they could have get.<br /><br />Take your loss and learn from it. These things happens.<br />The more experience you have the less you will buy bad weed.<br /><br />&quot;&quot;Learning money&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Remind that if you want your money back, future sellers will properly not sell to you and ask for sure for FE<br />Certainly not if you have asked for your money back for the second time if you only have just only 10 sales on your name<br /><br />A high price doesn&#039;t say a thing about the quality.<br /><br />So if this was your first order, I should give him a one out of five and give him just bad feedback and never order again by that seller.<br /><br />Every user will deal with such problems the first few years.<br />The longer you have experience the less it will happen to you.<br /><br />If you have 30 times bought weed and never asked for you money back, you will have a good chance.<br />If you have only ten times bought something and start asking for your money back, seller will not sell at all or at least ask for finalizing early.<br /><br />Nobody can decide for you what to do.<br />If you don&#039;t know, how should we know?<br />You will have to weight the pro&#039;s and contra&#039;s.
