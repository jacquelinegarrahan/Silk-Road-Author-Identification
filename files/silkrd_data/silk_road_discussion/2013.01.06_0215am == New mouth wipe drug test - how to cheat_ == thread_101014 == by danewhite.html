				Yes we have been introduced to these not so awesome machines in my country (denmark) and i believe that they use the same machines in germany but iam not sure?<br />The main thing they check for is cannabis - the government has ordered a zero policy against driving while high on cannabis - this itself i have no big issue with but the problem is that these machines they use dont just check 18 hours or 24 hours back - they will check back for days maby even weeks after smoking some mj..<br />So far they have suspended over 100 people in copenhagen for driving on the roads for atleast 3 years with the help of these machines and the zero policy.. Even when drunk u get a chance to re-new ur driving license but thats not the case here.. Its the result of a long fight against the hash marked and now they decided to target the buyers in every way they can.<br /><br />Thats why iam calling out for help here on SR - i believe that there must be a way to get around this shitty drug test?<br /><br />Please help me out here if&nbsp; possible.. this just aint right..

Deny a spit test, and just use fake urine. Otherwise you place any nickel coin beneath your tongue, and when taking in the tester in your mouth, keep it BENEATH your&nbsp; tongue. Act as if you would be brusing around your teeth as they ask you to do, but in reality you just bend the stick. It works 100 %. Always make sure to have syn urin on you as they might ask you for a piss test aswell if tested negative on the spit test. And if you got to piss and you are proofen negative, off you go!!!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />DocMorris.

				We have a similar test here in Oz. You scrape your tongue with a stick and it&#039;s supposed to test for amphetamines and cannabis.<br />&nbsp; In this country the test is often performed in conjunction with roadside breath tests for alcohol. It&#039;s turned out to be wildly inaccurate for cannabis, with many false positives being overturned in court. <br />&nbsp;There seems to be little information regarding these tests and I personally think this is fear peddling more than anything else. One of my close friends was tested 30 minutes after smoking a joint a few weeks ago and the test came up negative. <br />Because THC stays in the body for weeks, I&#039;m guessing that the readings for THC must need be within a certain threshhold for the cops to class it as a positive result.<br />&nbsp;In all honesty, I would love to know more about it.<br />Anyone here got the lowdown on this?<br />&nbsp;

				saliva drug tests are the least sensitive for weed. THC may only be detectable in saliva/oral fluid for 2â€“24 hours in most cases. Much less than a piss test.

				The danish swap, test for something like 8 different drugs and you need to keep it in your mouth for 10 min, keeping fake urine on you at all time seems a bit overkill, and nothing stops them from doing a body seach. If you could beat it by keeping a coin your mouth game on then :)

				Just heard about this a couple days ago...apparently they&#039;re going to be starting it in the USA soon if they haven&#039;t started already. I just hope that there&#039;s a way to beat it, or I don&#039;t have to take one...or I&#039;m completely clean enough to pass (hahahahaha...that&#039;s a funny thought)<br />I&#039;ll be keeping an eye on this thread.<br />Hopefully someone has some good info on countries that are implementing it, when, for what purposes (job markets, popularity, etc.) and possible methods of passing when you&#039;ve got drugs in your system.

				Yeah but how long do you have to wait before you drive?? If these tests were really about road safety, we should be told how long you should wait after smoking a bifta.

				EDIT: NEVER EVER COMBINE&nbsp; DEPRENYL/SELEGILINE WITH ANY SORT OF STIMULANT. THE RESULTS COULD BE LIFE THREATENING.<br /><br />Regarding amphetamines here is something that could never possibly work:<br /><br />* Firstly do not drive after taking amphetamine/methamphetamine or any other illegal drug.<br /><br />1. Aquire a script for Deprenyl/Selegeline (has metabolites of l-amphetamine and l-methamphetamine but would be unlikely to show up in saliva).<br />2. Have a device (e.g. smart phone) with recording capability and record all interaction with LE<br />3. Bite your tongue so it is bleeding. <br />4. Either subtly inform LE of the bleeding (perhaps for their hygiene sake), or, preferably, be prepared to pay to get your own sample analyzed for blood.<br />5. Say nothing else other than what you are legally obliged to.<br />6. In court show evidence of your Deprenyl/Selegiline prescription and show evidence of it&#039;s metabolites.<br /><br />LE WOULD DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO demonstrate that their lab results differentiate between dex/levo amphetamine and dex/levo methamphetamine?<br /><br />Also having blood in your mouth COULD NOT POSSIBLY be a defense against all saliva testing on the grounds that it may show positive results where saliva on it&#039;s own would not therefore making it discriminatory.

				This has just been announced for cannabis here in the uk, although they have to take you to the police station to do the saliva test and if it shows up positive then you have a blood test, by a dr,&nbsp; to confirm the result. <br /><br />Having been smoking and driving for over 10 years, I am not worried by these new tests, your ability to look normal and pass the personality test is your best bet, along with sparking a cigarette and opening a window as soon as you fear you may be pulled. <br /><br />If you look and act like something out of Waynes World or Cheech &amp; Chong after a spliff and drive round with a 420 or cannabis leaf sticker in your car then I wouldn&#039;t bother smoking and driving.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Oddly enough I&#039;ve been doing a lot of research into drug testing recently.<br /><br />My understanding is that saliva tests detect THC in your saliva (duh...) but urine tests detect THC metabolites. What this means is saliva tests will pick up recent usage, so a few hours to a couple of days (at most) since using. Urine tests checking for the metabolites pick up usage over a longer term as the THC that is stored in your body fat takes longer to be metabolised and then excreted.<br /><br />Point is, urine test will detect longer term usage of THC, but saliva tests won&#039;t. I&#039;ve read anywhere from 5 to 48 hours before a saliva test will come up clean, however this is still much shorter than the weeks or months of a urine test, so a good thing in detecting actually impaired drivers (to use one example.)<br /><br />Just as a disclaimer, I am from Australia where we have roadside saliva tests already and it&#039;s these I&#039;ve been looking into mostly. And in case it helps fellow aussies out, I&#039;ve been breath tested more times than I can remember but not once have I been subjected to a drug test on the roads, so I don&#039;t think they&#039;re as common as the traffic ads would have you believe. This is only my experience though, and maybe it&#039;s not typical.<br />

				In regards to the saliva test that the OP posted about, my job uses the swab test randomly at my job in the US. <br /><br />They take a cotton swab and wipe your tongue and mouth. They then test the swab and if its positive for thc you get escorted to your locker to clean it out and are then escorted off he companys property.<br /><br />Ive passed after 24 hours since the last time i smoked with no problems. If you are that worried i suggest baking some edibles! I love pot brownies.You can eat em anywhere and no ones the wiser. Plus no worrries on failing a swab test. All you gotta do is stay one step ahead of them and your all good.

				a common drug test done by employers sounds very similar to your situation. <br /><br />if it&#039;s anything like it, it can be defeated by a big swish of hydrogen peroxide, like mouthwash! yes it sounds kind of disgusting, but it does work. ;)<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />well, it works for typical mouth swabs done for employers in USA.

Mind you this is just leap of logic on my part and not something I&#039;ve looked into.) Even if you did put something into your system that gives a positive result first up, my understanding of most companies procedures would be a further analysis is organised in a lab to specifically determine if it&#039;s correct or a false positive. So if there something out there that gives such a result I wouldn&#039;t be relying on the &#039;Oh, sorry, I had X yesterday so the reading must be that instead&#039; defence.<br /><br />And again, I haven&#039;t looked into this specifically but I highly doubt mints would help. I mean there might be a very small chance of this tricking a saliva test, but I would assume it would give a false positive, not a false negative (as the THC would still be there, just with something else.) So that really comes down to the above again, they would most likely test you further and you&#039;d be found out.

				Just wondered if it would be best to refuse the saliva test then get tested positive on the urine test.<br /><br />Reason being that if the urine tests positive for metabolites then you could say that it was from some hep products or something. Without the test for THC in the saliva there may be too much doubt for a conviction based solely on that test.
