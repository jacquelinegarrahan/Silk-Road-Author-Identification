				Wow time flies. Can&#039;t believe I have been buying on SR for a year now.&nbsp; That means I have only bought a couple of grams of weed off my friends throughout this whole time and never dealt with dealers.&nbsp; I think I have been way less stressed out due to me having bad experiences with real life dealers giving me underweight/crappy/overpriced/bunk shit as well as being way more paranoid dealing with them.&nbsp; I guess I started couple days before my birthday too since it is only a few days away.&nbsp; <br /><br />This place has been great. Really fucking hope it stays this way.<br /><br />Thanks everyone!!

				My year anniversary was last week.&nbsp; Originally thought it was a great place to get drugs to impress girls (lol) but found out that it is a modern groundbreaking movement.&nbsp; One of the coolest things about it is that it is global.&nbsp; No one can really tell how much longer this will keep up but when I figured out how to work this place I told myself all I wanted was one good year.&nbsp; And it happened. And now I can take a step back from this place, content.&nbsp; This place gave me the kind of experience that cannot be matched.&nbsp; Thanks to every single member here, from DPR to the hundreds (maybe even thousands) of scammers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; P.S.- I&#039;ve only&nbsp; hung out with one girl since I found this place. My first order was some weak MDMA, didn&#039;t really work.&nbsp; I looked like some weirdo buying some white powder off the internet. Never heard from here again. lol.

				Congrats to you too man. Sorry to hear about your plan not working out.&nbsp; I honestly would never try to get girls with drugs, it just gives you as a reputation as a creep around here.&nbsp; Not only that they tend to use you for the drugs if you do get them to come over(seen other guys I know get fucked over like this hanging out with them).&nbsp; Been with 5 girls in the last year lol&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />However, I&#039;m just surprised it has been this long because I honestly thought I wouldn&#039;t be here after a couple months lol.&nbsp; I also love the fact that I can try drugs from all over the world.&nbsp; It&#039;s a really cool feeling.&nbsp; However, I tried to be very careful who I deal with in terms of getting the best bang for the buck.&nbsp;

				Dude I this month is my one year too! I have no clue what date it is though lol and I officially am out of the game so I am not ordering through online anymore. But 20k spent alone just on SR let alone the other buys I have made on other forums, I think it was a good run 8) Congrats on the one year man!!<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper
