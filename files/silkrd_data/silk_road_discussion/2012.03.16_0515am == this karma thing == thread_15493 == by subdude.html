				This karma thing is funny, you can get a negative karma mark by a person who has bad karma. You can have an opinion about how dumb something is and in retaliation they give out bad karma marks to create good karma? Being upset and screwing with karma values is a weird conundrum.

				It&#039;s curious, I got two negs quite quickly, i imagine within the first day or two of it running. The problem with this sort of system is it doesn&#039;t differentiate between posts. I&#039;m not sure what I said that somebody didn&#039;t like, so the entire thing seems pointless.<br /><br />A much better system is having a -/+ system for individual posts. That way if someone posts interesting/insightful information, people currently reading the thread can instantly see if a post is trustworthy by the amount of +&#039;s it&#039;s been given.

				@fiveseven,<br /><br />That could be a good idea. Especially if a post that is voted down enough becomes unreadable. It would be a form of community moderation.&nbsp; For instance, if someone posts some posts something hateful or rude, if it offends the community, it can be voted down into oblivion.<br /><br />Even troll posts could find their posts obliterated.

				I seemed to get a -1 after posting in this thread which seems weird but also makes me wonder why we get no clues on the points we get.<br />It would probably be more helpful knowing which post received the negative or positive point so we could possibly change how we respond or at the very least, learn from it. Also, if others could see why we got our negatives/positives, it would give them a better idea of how to view our credability, since that&#039;s the point of this karma thing right?<br /><br />It just doesn&#039;t make sense to judge on just how many we have altogether...or maybe that&#039;s just me?

				the points dont really mean anything. its designed, i believe, to help newer members by giving a rough balance of the community&#039;s opinion of that person&#039;s credibility or im unsure the correct word but in reality it provides a sense of usefulness to the community. this is cause previous scammers used to jack up their post count to dupe the newer members into false sense of security.<br /><br />its not like you can exchange your points into bitcoins or anything so there really is no sense worrying about it. further i would argue that &#039;changing your reponse&#039; is counterintuitive to this whole community so just be yourself. after a longer while the scales will prob balance out into a more true representation if your usefulness.<br /><br />now maybe a system where individual posts can be liked/disliked by members is more efficient way of achieving what were acuallh trying to achieve. after all this is a huge budding social network here

				I posted about this in the feature requests forum.

				I also find that Karma thing useless unless their can be a new aplication when somebody give you good/bad karma that user can click on it and read the reason why. I think that must be the fairest thing to do. If i wanna give someone good karma then i have to give a short reason why, also when i give somebody bad karma. Now people can give bad karma over stupid things, like bitching to eachother tru pm&#039;s and therefor give eachother bad karma what i find realy lame. I know its just nothing for the most people, but i think some members realy think that when they have -20 karma or so that the person thinks that the whole community thinks bad about them. I know it sounds stupid to most of the members here, but wouldn&#039;t that be a solution?? Then people can ask a member &quot; hey why you gave bad karma to that member, just about he/she said...to you??&quot;. Then we find the childish people here on the forum because they need to give a short explanation why they did it. But i don&#039;t care that much, but i know there are people here who have more then -5 karma and i find those members nice and helpfull always when i ask them something.<br />Just my opinion here.<br />Greettzz

				I agree the reciever of karma should be able to read why they received it, possibly who it was from, and even have the option to possibly discuss the matter with the the &quot;karma-giver&quot;, at their discretion.<br /><br />We also feel we have done nothing to deserve any negative karma, although we do have a good idea where it came from. And we hope it will be reverseed at some point. But again, it&#039;s just a number.<br /><br />A members &quot;karma&quot; should be based on the merits of their posts. This &quot;karma&quot; policy attempts to address that to an extent, but falls short in many aspects. There is defintley room for improvement, as many of the great suggestions here have implied.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				Prime example. <br /><br />We just received another negative karma point since our last post. We have gone out of our way to be nothing but helpful and nice on this forum, both under this alias, and many others. We honestly feel we have done nothing to &quot;ever&quot; deserve even a single negative point. That&#039;s why we feel it would be a nice option if one could know why a negative point was received. It would give the receiver the opportunity to fix the issue in the future. <br /><br />Isn&#039;t that the point of this policy in the first place? To point out the positive or negative effects a members posts or actions may be having on others in the community? <br /><br />We for one would like to know who has been posting our negative karma, and preferably know their reasons for doing so. And possibly have the opportunity to discuss the issue with them further, if they feel. How else can we can improve on &quot;whatever it may be&quot; in the future?<br /><br />The karma system is obviously wide-open for abuse and is potentially affecting the community at large in a negative way. Our negative points could, for example, be coming from a competing vendor attempting to discredit us before we even have a chance to establish our reputation here on the Road.<br /><br />No one knows unfortunately how much faith any particular member might put into another members &quot;karma&quot; rating, but this &quot;could&quot; obviously potentially affect sales for a new vendor such as ourselves. <br /><br />Until the opportunity to abuse this policy (and abuse is obviously happening) is eliminated, perhaps the entire concept should be temporaraly disabled until many of the concerns expressed in this thread are addressed?<br /><br />It is potentially affecting the overall legitamicy of the marketplace that the Road provides, along with (at times) potentially, and unfairly, affecting the reputations of buyers and vendors alike.<br /><br />Just our opinion.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

That not only you but the public can see who gave you that bad karma and the reason why. I see you are disapointed about your karma and when you really didn&#039;t do or say anything bad then its most likely a -18y person (child) or a troll. I think when you and the public can see why and who gave you bad karma then it is open for discussion and i think most of the trolls keep their silence if they know that the name of the giver is revealed + a good short explanation why?? And i know because i say this know that they gonna give me bad karma also because of my sugestion for improvement. Because when i see users with -20 or more, then i am curious what they have said or done wrong so much.<br />Ps : If there are users with real balls and be a real man, then speak out when you give someone bad karma. We don&#039;t have to wait for improvement just step up and write open on the forum who and why you gave someone bad karma instead of typing behind your screen and troll the whole day.

				RE: This &quot;karma&quot; shit.<br /><br />We have received 2 more (we feel) completely &#039;unwarranted&#039; negative &quot;karma&quot; points since posting our last post in this thread. We honestly feel we have done NOTHING to deserve even ONE single negative &quot;karma&quot; point since we joined this forum, either under this alias, or any other we may have used in the past. <br /><br />We have been nothing short of helpful, informative, and kind in all of our posts, to all members, and the community at large. <br /><br />Since it has already been well established that this policy is &quot;obviously&quot; being abused for a variety of reasons, we feel it may competing vendors that have posted the majority of &#039;our&#039; negative &quot;karma&quot; in an attempt to discredit us before we even have an opportunity to establish our reputation here on the Road. <br /><br />Being a new vendor, offering the wide selection of products we do, at the prices we do, would be appealing to most buyers. But we are certain there are vendors here that would feel much, MUCH differently.<br /><br />It has always been our intention to attempt to lower the prices here whenever possible, not only because we &#039;can&#039;, and are &quot;true believers&quot;, but because we simply feel many of the prices currently being offered on certain products here are simply far, FAR too high. Nothing wrong with wanting to change that. That is &quot;Capitalism 101&quot; my friend. :)<br /><br />This is, of course, simply our opinion. And nothing more.<br /><br />Regardless, this policy is obviously being abused, as proven by the plethora of concerns expressed by members in this thread. And it&#039;s quite honestly getting pretty ridiculous at this point. It is effecting the legitimacy of the SR model in general, along with, at times, unfairly effecting the reputations of both buyers and vendors alike. <br /><br />We sincerely feel this policy should possibly be temporarily suspended pending further investigation, just as the abuse of any other policy on SR would be.<br /><br />Members concerns should be addressed, most importantly (we feel), we should be given the option to know why you received your &quot;karma&quot;, possibly &quot;who&quot; gave it to you, and potentially even the ability to discuss the issue with the &quot;karma-giver&quot;, at their discretion of course.<br /><br />How else is anyone supposed to &quot;learn&quot; or otherwise know what they should do to improve on &quot;whatever it may be&quot; in the future? Seriously?<br /><br />We feel so strongly about this at this point that we are offering a free $50 gift certificate to our shop to any member that can point to any posts we have made that would have made us deserving of, let&#039;s say, at least 3 of our (currently) 6 negative karma points. Hell, even just 1....but 3 is our &quot;very real&quot; offer.<br /><br />Although we are quite certain our negative &quot;karma&quot; will increase significantly after THIS post, lol... :)<br /><br />To win, you must post links to our posts that would prove (aka be peer-reviewed) that we were deserving of the majority of our negative &quot;karma&quot;. If a respectable number of respectable members agree with you, you just got yourself $50.<br /><br />Well...$50 In drugs, lol... :)<br /><br />But thats a promise! <br /><br />That is all.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				man why is everyone so concerned about their arbitrary website karma?? get over it and just act as you normally would ffs.<br /><br />flipside, you are receiving negative karma with your posts here cause youre trolling for people to give you +1 it seems or its just blatant whining about your -1 and thats just fucking annoying. hence why people are &#039;punishing&#039; you for your barely veiled attempt to have positive karma thrown at you. who gives a shit, you cant exchange them for btc and people are gonna find out your karma anyway from just your posts. i know you probably think as a vendor you need to build up the good rep well you&#039;re doing it wrong. have successful transactions on the road with good feedback there. thats all you need to do.<br /><br />now for $50 prize, no thanks but just so you know i gave you -1 (the first ive ever given) for your post just now

				Well, Flipside, I am not going to try to win anything from you, and feel free to ding my karma for this, but I gave you a -1 not for a specific post, but about your entire original business model of all communication being done off of SR, and I really think that the individual key per customer idea is horrible....... [off subject] in my mind, I imagine a defense lawyer trying to convince a jury that &quot;anyone could have ordered that&quot; when each individual has ONE key that they use. [/off subject]<br /><br />So I gave you a -1 not from a single post, but because I don&#039;t like YOU. I am not embarassed or ashamed of the karma I gave you. But from here forward, I will try to remember to post when I give neg. karma. I hope you can appreciate my honesty!

				To both cheifrogan and wretched. I applaud you both for standing up and expressing your reasons for posting your karma. This is the first time I have seen anyone do this, and it is indeed :a &quot;very&quot; honorable action ;).<br /><br />I do however feel you have both misunderstood certain things about me/us that may have contributed to your opinions and choices.<br /><br />Cheif:<br /><br /><br />1. As I have expressed past, I am &#039;truly&#039; not bothered by the karma. It is just a number. Plain and simple. I feel the merits of my posts speak for themselves. It is the ongoing abuse of this poilcy that concerns me.<br /><br />2. I have never &quot;trolled&quot; for points. Or &quot;trolled&quot;, anywhere. Ever. I have indeed expressed my sincere concerns re: this policy, and would appreciate it if you could perhaps point me to any posts where you feel I have done so. The thought has ,quite honestly, NEVER even crossed my mind until you mentioned it.<br /><br />3. Besides some of what you consider &quot;whining&quot; in this tread, every other post we have made on these forums have been extremely helpful and considerate, offering sound advice to others in need, or sometimes to announce to the community information about our new business, the selection of products we carry, and the security methods we employ to protect each customers personal information. What is wrong with that?<br /><br />We, among many other long-time, successful vendors, have used these policies for many years. It&#039;s not some idea we just &#039;dreamed up&#039; recently. Our overall security protocol is a proven recipe we spent years designing, and we fell it most definately provides additional, beneficial security for everyone involved. Why would &#039;anyone&#039;, be against better increased security?<br /><br />4. We intend to establish our reputation on the Road the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; way. Free samples, great customer service, low prices and fast shipping times. And at times, yes,&nbsp; promotions. Although I am but one of a team in our endevour, I have &#039;persoanlly&#039; run a few of my own successful businesses in the &quot;real-world&quot; over the years. So this ain&#039;t my first rodeo. ;)<br /><br />But we honestly feel you have misunderstood our intentions on certain matters Cheif. This is unfortunate, and we can only hope that you would consider rethinking some of these matters over again. But the world will keep spinning regardless... ;)<br /><br />wretched:<br /><br />1. Again we feel you too have misunderstood some things about us. We have NEVER intended to, attempted to, claimed to, and of course&nbsp; never sold &quot;anything&quot; off SR since we have been a vendor here. We have, and intend to continue, to follow ALL of the rules that the Road requires of us. We have discussed this matter extensively with SR staff, and they agree. We have posted it numerous times in various threads. Where do you get this information? We really don&#039;t know why you would think we opperate outside of SR, escrow, ect.? We have made this fact VERY clear, numerous times.<br /><br />2. I would never &#039;ding&#039; anyone&#039;s karma for simply expressing their opinion. Everyone is entitled to opinions, and to express them here. <br /><br />Assigning unique contact emails is a proven, long-standing security enhancment with enormous potential benifits to both buyer and vendor. The best vendors we know have used this method for years. We have explained our reasoning behind this policy in our vendor threads, however we would be happy to elaborate more here if you like? <br /><br />It is our opinion that along with assigning unique GPG keys to each new account, using unique contact emails at the same time truly is a step &quot;forward&quot; in security for all parties involved. I feel perhaps you do not quite fully understand the concept? No offense intended at all my friend, but if you would like to further understand the benifits this policy can provide, either search our vendor threads, or just ask.<br /><br />And its really is no different than how most other vendors do it. We give you a public key and a email address to contact us. How is that much different from how many other vendors do it? Seriously?<br /><br />I am sorry you seem have made up your mind that you &quot;just don&#039;t like me&quot; already. We don&#039;t even know each other my friend. Except for a few posts in this thread? I rest assured that I aim to be the best possible person I can be on a daily basis, and seek to improve myself all the time in my 35+ cycles on spaceship Earth.<br /><br />And those who truly know m (both on and off-line) agree. My friends in the real world consider me a great person, and that means more to me than your opinion, again, no offense intended. And I feel the same about myself. I go out of my way to be as polite and helpful to others as possible. I honestly do my best to &#039;do my part&#039; for the community, and I feel the majority of my posts reflect that. I hope perhaps, over time, that I can convince you I am truly not a bad person.<br /><br />But thank you both for having the balls to stand up and speak your minds. Although I do not agree with much of what either of you posted about me/us, I feel many of your opinions were based on misunderstandings. <br /><br />Either way, thank you. I honestly do respect and appreciate your opinions and your explanations as to why you gave us negative karma. I truly wish this were always an option. Your opinions are respected, and we support everyones &quot;self-evident&quot; right to express them. <br /><br />You two are true pioneers! ;) For that, we thank you. ;)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside

				I agree. Every rating system I have ever seen is flawed and can be manipulated.<br /><br />In forums, the newcomers are at the mercy of the people that have been there longer, so the newbies have to basically kiss everyone&#039;s asses while the veterans can say whatever they want.<br /><br />I have been on forums where you can leave positive ratings for good posts, and some people get good ratings almost immediately for the stupidest comments.<br /><br />In online commerce forums, sellers just find a way to buy feedback or to give themselves feedback. Feedback rating can tell you something, but not everything, about a seller. On silkroad, I say you are taking a risk anyway, so if you can&#039;t afford to lose the money that you were going to use, just don&#039;t buy it.

				We&#039;ve just finally reached the point where yet another Silk Road rating system turns out to useless because it&#039;s so open to abuse.&nbsp; Karma is getting to be like the SR vendor rating number.&nbsp; Vendors can create a number of alternate SR user accounts and then log in to those user accounts for the sole purpose of building up the vendor&#039;s rating.&nbsp; It&#039;s done because it works.&nbsp; <br /><br />And now we have this Karma rating where you can get dinged for just trying to get people to not try shit that will blow up in their faces.&nbsp; O.K., fine, I&#039;ll disregard Karma ratings the same way I disregard SR vendor ratings.&nbsp;

				Well, there should only be the ability to leave positive Karma. Negative Karma doesn&#039;t have any real meaning. I&#039;ve seen posters with a lot of negative Karma that doesn&#039;t make any sense considering their posts have been good. <br /><br />And not being able to see who left a positive or negative sort of defeats the purpose and can create &quot;paranoia&quot; in some. &quot;I bet it was so and so who left me a negative!&quot; LOL. <br /><br />Remove the negative Karma and you remove one half of abusing the system.

But I do believe in general, a vendors reputation tends to speaks for itself. Both thru feedback from their transactions, as well the opinions expressed by their respective customers on the forums. &quot;If&quot; a vendor were to use this tactic, it would most likely only work well against &#039;newbie&#039; buyers.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				I appreciate the effort and thought that went into this, coming from people trying to improve the site, and I guess the idea is it would let people logging in see who to listen to, who is respected and appreciated by the rest of us, all that.&nbsp; Problem is, it just doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Negative karma particularly seems to have no bearing on anything that I can see.&nbsp; Maybe a little vindictiveness is it, but it&#039;s totally useless as far as getting an accurate picture of the person who has it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on other sites that&#039;ve tried various means to accomplish the same thing, and I&#039;ve not seen anything that works, other than just hanging out a lot on the site itself.<br /><br />I actually think it should be discontinued, or if that isn&#039;t acceptable, discontinue the negative karma, and just leave positive.&nbsp; Like others, I haven&#039;t yet, and won&#039;t post negative karma.

				The more I think about the more i agree eliminating the ability to post &quot;negative&quot; karma &#039;might&#039; be a good idea. However, on the other hand I also feel it would defeat the entire purpose of the entire &quot;karma&quot; concept in general.<br /><br />Kind of like I fucking HATE neo-nazi&#039;s, but I (reluctantly) 100% support their right to gather in public to express their beliefs, as provided by the US Constitution, as well as in various country-wide and international laws/treaty&#039;s in effect throughout the world. <br /><br />So I am still torn between whether it would be &quot;fair&quot; to eliminate &quot;only&quot; the ability to post negative karma (as much sense as it might make at times), as opposed to eliminating the concept in general, and letting members retain the freedom to speak and post karma for themselves as they please. <br /><br />Although this policy is obviously being abused by some, it is the &quot;secrecy&quot; behind &quot;who&quot; posted the karma and &quot;why&quot; that seems to be the issue. We were &quot;very&quot; happy today to receive a pm from an anonymous member informing us they had given us our 6th &quot;positive&quot; karma point. :)<br /><br />We of course expressed our sincere gratitude, however, an explanation as to why they chose to do so would have been nice. So it works both ways. Although I&#039;d imagine (and hope) that the very fact that we received our point must be due to us having &quot;some&quot; sort of &quot;positive&quot; impact on the community at large. And that alone is reason enough I suppose. :)<br /><br />But the same cannot be said for &quot;negative&quot; karma.<br /><br />If someone post&#039;s something that is truly &quot;bad&quot; advice (which I do believe is the purpose of the ability to post negative karma in the first place, no? To discourage such behavior?), then certainly multiple respected members will surely post shortly after why they feel might it be bad advice.<br /><br />So the &quot;karma&quot; system is &#039;essentially&#039; already in effect, only in a much more democratic and &#039;opensource&#039; ;)&nbsp; way, as it stands.<br /><br />Or so a little bird told me. :)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				With so many TRULY good, honest, helpful memebers here seeming to get so much negative karma for no apparent reason, I&#039;m starting to wonder if it might perhaps just be a glitch in the SR system? It &quot;is&quot; a new implementation after all?<br /><br />Perhaps SR staff/coders could chime in on this possibilty?<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />TFC

				pretty obvious :-<br />- i don&#039;t believe any mod or admins are going to want to do anything about resolving karma qualms we have as individuals.<br />- why implement a system like karma when you know what additional problems it would introduce and already made<br />&nbsp; up your mind you&#039;ll be ignoring the extra administration overhead..<br /><br /><br />- its just like politicians and their unjust laws introduced by the backdoor: made law that its supposed to catch criminals but is (mis)applied to <br />&nbsp; where ever it sticks.<br />&nbsp; - karma to be appllied to thank and get rid of trolls, but<br />&nbsp; - its hidden -nobody can query anything..?!<br />&nbsp; - and what happens to those who make obscene comments etc = nothing?!<br />&nbsp; - would it help get rid of say -scammers ....currently = No?!<br />{sound familiar?!}&nbsp; <br /><br />- hence why its intentionally implemented by design.<br />

				In all honestly, I think SR staff have &#039;much&#039; more serious matters to be concerned about at the moment. Like ensuring the ongoing security of the entire community. I&#039;m certain they feel OUR safety if far more worthy of the limited amount of time they have to spend working on the site, ect, than to concern themselves with &#039;rather&#039; small issues like this; as important as they may be to many of us, and even though it &#039;was&#039; them that implemented policies such as this in the first place. <br /><br />I also believe their &#039;intentions&#039; were 100% sincere when they thought to implement the system in the first place. It seems they perhaps they just didn&#039;t &#039;think it through&#039; as well as they should have before implementing it. We have made similar mistakes in the past, aka, offering products before we were fully ready to do so. We have also learned from those mistakes. <br /><br />SR is only around a year old, and is indeed still a &quot;work in progress&quot;, and I can only imagine the amount of variables/factors they must consider when running a site like this. I do believe they are doing their best.<br /><br />The fact that they have not responded quicker to this issue, imo, is (in all honesty) a &quot;testament&quot; to DPR&#039;s integrity, aka, his choice to trust and use only a &quot;very&quot; small group of hand-picked mods and staff. As opposed to just &#039;hiring&#039; (even just &quot;one&quot; more) mod to deal with the overflow of &#039;issues&#039; such as this floating around.<br /><br />And just a another thought...<br /><br />Perhaps a &#039;compromise&#039; between many of the thoughts in this thread? <br /><br />What if it took 2-3 &quot;separate&quot; negative discouragements, from 2-3 separate members, before 1 negative point were posted for any given member?<br /><br />Since the &#039;negative&#039; aspect of the karma seems to be the problem, this would help stem &quot;unwarranted&quot; negative points, to an extent, no?<br /><br />Just a thought. :)

				TWM,<br /><br />We COMPLETLEY agree!<br /><br />Karma &quot;is&quot; SHIT!<br /><br />But there are TRULY just 24 hours in one day. And a (respected) &#039;limited&#039; amount of mods/staff.

That&#039;s our opinion.<br /><br />Unless this issue is addressed ASAP, it should really just be discontinued until it&#039;s &#039;good to go&#039;.<br /><br />Should there really be &#039;this&#039; many pages/issues wasted over this &#039;single&#039; issue?

				Ours thoughts as well. Perhaps even groups of collaborating vendors using negative karma to attempt to discredit other competing vendors, ect.<br /><br />Since the karma is anonymous, &#039;anyone&#039; could easily set up multiple accounts to get 100+ posts very quickly. Then post neg karma for&nbsp; whatever reason. Every 3 days. And then again. And again. And...&quot;to infinity and beyond!&quot; <br /><br />Many users likely just assume the karma they see &#039;must&#039; be legit since it does take 100 posts to use (or abuse) this function. But again. It&#039;s anon, and very easy to rack up 100 posts, in a very short time. :(<br /><br />&nbsp;

				This is funny as hell and I&#039;m sure the mods are getting a huge kick out of all us people on here crying over getting negative karma. Watch me get another negative for saying this. Probably because I use profanity hahaha but it&#039;s just words. I am very philosophical and I don&#039;t follow any religion but I have a deep faith in God. I don&#039;t care if these bible thumpers think I am going to hell. To me, they are all brainwashed and being controlled by a book. Now hit me up with some negative shit hahahaha
