				Hi all, just a quick question: Do most vendors do pre or post commission pricing? I have elected to go post commission, but fear it may be putting me at a disadvantage against other vendors. Because their is no way to tell before purchasing, my prices will probably not look as good up against others, so i may miss out on sales? Just wondering if i should switch to pre, or what everybody thinks?

				I was always under the impression that the pre\post commission setting only effected how the vendor viewed the price, and the buyer either always saw post-commission prices or opted to select either.

NONE. Though I can tell you I do pre and I list all my items with the numbers .88 so in my case this wouldn&#039;t apply :)&nbsp; <br /><br />To the OP....I think you are looking into this way too much. I do not know what you vend...but I have found that pricing is about the 5th thing buyers care about in my year of vending here. Though every new vendor believes pricing is number 1 ...and they all come in with there prices a lot lower then the competitors as they believe that is how they will get business. It simply is not true. Though I know in these forums you will here about wanting lower prices...but that is to be expected as every buyer would want lower prices...but I can tell you that the fact is pricing is not a major concern. Being consistent, being reliable and shipping FAST/process even faster will get you all the business you could want.<br /><br />Also&nbsp; I do not think you are at any disadvantage at all. But if YOU believe you are...then just switch to what you think most of the vendors are doing...and if you think most of the vendors are doing pre...then why the thread? As it seems you know the answer. :D&nbsp; Also this thread would be best if you did it in the vendor forum...
