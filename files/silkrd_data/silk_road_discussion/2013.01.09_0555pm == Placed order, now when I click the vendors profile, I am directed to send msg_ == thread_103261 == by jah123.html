				I have placed an order with NSNS (UK) and I am currently waiting on dispatch, I sent him or her a message prior to ordering and have heard nothing back since, order is still in processing.<br /><br />When I click the vendors profile to check their news feed to see whether there is any delays in dispatching orders, I am redirected to send them a message, does anyone know why this is?<br /><br />Regards

				Sounds like they are no longer vendors :-( I would contact maybe one of the mods, but first SR Support. Then maybe POLITELY ask a mod if they might have a friend over at vendor support who just may let them in on what&#039;s up.

				I also ordered from NSNS - his vendor page is still disabled as a I type but he has just marked my order despatched and has PM&#039;d to confirm and apologise for late despatch.<br /><br />Trusted vendor since he started on SR, with &gt; 10 transactions.

				Yes I have also received a message. NSNS is a reputable vendor and supplies top quality, I can confirm that from a previous order. Should be back to normal soon.

				So does anybody know the score with NSNS? He only recently listed a lot of new products and dropped the price of some hash I was coveting so it seems strange to just close a vendor account like that. Hopefully he is in stealth mode but from other people have said, I&#039;m not too sure.
