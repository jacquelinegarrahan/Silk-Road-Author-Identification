				Because its safer than going down to the street corner for junk and most of it is very good weed.<br /><br />A few sellers have some more economical commercial varieties that are less potent.<br /><br />Swazibudbud8888 comes to mind.

				alright, the reason i&#039;m stumped is because i sell ganj and it goes for about 200 a zip on the streets for chronic ass fuck dank.. always top shit through out the whole town. everyone has the dosia and i was wondering if people are just being ass holes by slangin that shit on here for a lot of dough.. I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s for the shipping aspect or the sellers taking in to account the risk into the overall price.

				You dont make much sense. <br /><br />No seller, street or otherwise, is going to complain about the prices because its their competition. Specifically LESS competition because&nbsp; you are cheaper than here. That would mean you get more sales so long as your competitors remain higher.<br /><br />I think you are full of shit and are just like every other whiney ass little kids who complains about prices here.

				I&#039;m not trying to head butts with you here.. That&#039;s stupid. I was just wondering why the prices were so expensive. If it&#039;s always expensive here (SR), I was thinking why not jump in and try to make it my niche since bud&#039;s super cheap and readily is available where I&#039;m from.

				I imagine vendors also set prices respective to the amount of business they can handle. The cheaper they set the prices, the more people will buy from them (assuming they&#039;re on top of their game) and it reaches a point where they just cannot handle the number of orders for any of a number of reasons. Higher prices regulate the customer base to a managable level.

				You pay for the quality, know a dude IRL, or grow yourself. Welcome to cannabis. <br />Kidding aside, as stated above they find that at 60 - 70 an 8th they can easily sell out, make large profit margins and not be worried about dealing with people with smaller amounts of money, who are more likely to ask for you to slide a coin or two they&#039;re light. <br />Though I would point out there are many vendors who sell at pretty normal prices you just need to pick up an ounce or four. <br /><br />Hedged means the order is using escrow, which doesn&#039;t mean allot to the buyer really (or at least it never really mattered to me) but it does mean the vendor gets the amount the coins were worth rather than the exact amount of coins it was for. If BTC drops value they get more coin, if it gains value they get less coin, but still the same value of coin (8 =$50 $50= 10 BTC (@5 BTC) or $50 = 20 BTC (@2.50 BTC)<br /><br />~Vendor Support
