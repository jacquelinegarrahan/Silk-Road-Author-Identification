				Okay, I&#039;ve done a little bit of shopping now: MDMA, LSD, a couple of pills here and there, but never even thought to ever order Cocaine into australia, ever... It&#039;s easily my favourite drug, but I&#039;m worried that it&#039;s a much more easily intercepted drug to be put in transit.<br /><br />Are there any success stories of Cocaine being sent to AUS? From anywhere?<br /><br />I&#039;d love to get it, as the purity is literally fucking 0.5% to 5% MAXIMUM over here. And at least 5x the price than any other country.<br /><br />Is this a good idea, or are our customs too hardcore?

				We have an Aussie thread in the off topic forum where these questions can be asked: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=139173.0<br /><br />But yeah, to answer your question, there are plenty of successful shipments of Cocaine into Aus. My advice is to use the search function and do some reading. All the information regarding anything can be found within the forums.

				If the OP wants to ask for some advice feel free to PM me.<br /><br />I&#039;m locking this to keep a lid on the aussie threads, no need to draw more attention than is necessary.
