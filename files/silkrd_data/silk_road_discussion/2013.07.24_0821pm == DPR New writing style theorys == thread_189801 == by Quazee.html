				Seems we have a lot of ass hats that keep accusing DPR of changing because of his writing style changing. This is good practice for security...maybe he posts somewhere else and doesn&#039;t want his writing matched. This guy has a lot of fucking enemies! <br /><br />I personally think it changes in proportion to the levels of psylocibin in his blood stream<br /><br />

				*sighs*Well, for those who haven&#039;t heard,&nbsp; in the excellent novel (and film) the Princess Bride, the protagonist hears a lot of terrifying tales about &#039;the Dread Pirate Roberts&#039;. When he is eventually captured by said Dread Pirate, DPR reveals that he is merely the latest in a long line of Dread Pirate Roberts. When a particular pirate feels he has amassed enough booty, and becomes weary of the freebooting life, he passes the ship and the name on to a replacement, who gets to trade on the fear inspiring name of the Dread Pirate Roberts.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sooooo......how does this apply to SR?<br />Firstly, Dread Pirate Roberts is an excellent name.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are a few possibilities:<br /><br />There has only ever been one DPR, who is double bluffing with the name. He changes his writing style now and then to confound and confuse.<br /><br />There have been several DPRs, the site has been sold on several times, after the current owner feels he has amassed sufficient booty.<br /><br />OR DPR is a fictional figurehead, the site is run by a group of hackers/Russian mafia/precocious schoolkids/Keyser Soze.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or some combination of the above.<br /><br />I have no opinion or feelings on the matter.

So of course he will just hire some joey to type for him. Unless he&#039;s like one of those obsessive types who is on the front line of his empire,<br />There should be an undercover boss version which DPR goes on the front line, and pretends to be a newb buyer. I think the name is apt, as this operation is bigger than one man. There is a team and each person takes over the mantra as and when the need arises. Plus he doesn&#039;t strike me as a person who can&#039;t quit while he&#039;s ahead, maybe he has long since handed over the reigns, who knows one things for sure, he&#039;s done an excellent job at keeping us safe.
