				Hi there,<br /><br />Im looking for a way of buying bitcoins with cash in Spain. To deposit money directly into a bank account requires a passport or some sort of identification that is noted down by the cashier. It seems the only reasonable way of purchasing them anonymously is via the &quot;reedemable coupon&quot; option but I cant seem to find anywhere that sells them. <br /><br />Does anyone have any ideas?

Remember, it&#039;s not illegal to buy Bitcoin, but it IS illegal to buy illegal drugs with them or any other payment method.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what Zip Code you&#039;re located in but here&#039;s the nearest local sellers to Zip Code 30 (Murcia); you can adjust your Zip Code on the site itself:<br />https://localbitcoins.com/postal_code/ES/30/<br /><br />Alternatively you can but Bitcoin via bitcoin-otc using many different methods, including Western Union:<br />http://bitcoin-otc.com/<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Cheers for that grahamgreen, iv already looked on localbitcoins but there doesnt seem to be anything in my area, I&#039;ll give bitcoin-otc a go and see how it goes. How anonymous is the transaction when using western union, they still take down your passport number so doesnt that mean theres a paper trail?

If you can find a Westen Union agent with no cameras that would be great, or one with only overhead cameras and just wear a baseball cap. When you receive your Bitcoin, tumble them well before sending them on to Silk Road.<br /><br />You should note that the paper used for Western Union transfers is designed to pick up fingerprints so you should, if possible, pick up some Western Union transfer sheets and fill them in at home wearing gloves and ensuring that you toss out the sheets from the top and the bottom of the pile.<br />When handing them over to the agent it would be advisable to wear gloves (if it&#039;s cold out - if it&#039;s not, you&#039;ll look very strange and draw attention) or by masking your fingerprints using some other method. If you do not use your real name then in the event of a problem with the transfer you won&#039;t be able to retrieve your money. If you&#039;re going to regularly be buying Bitcoin using this method I would suggest getting a fake ID and using the name on that. That way if there is a problem, you can go in and request your money back, and show them your ID.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
