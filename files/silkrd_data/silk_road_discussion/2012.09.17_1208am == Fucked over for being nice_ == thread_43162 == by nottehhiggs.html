				I placed an order on august 24th for a half ounce of robertbennet420&#039;s special hash, it seemed like a great deal <br />for the quality he claimed and all of the feedback was great saying they received the package in no less <br />than 5 days usually and I really hate waiting long so I ordered some.<br /><br />3+ weeks later and here I am, never received the hash so I assumed it somehow got lost or the packaging was crappy and my postman happened to be a toker. I nicely wrote in the resolution center that I would like a refund so that i could re-buy the hash seeing as i really wanted it(I saw nothing wrong with this because I had no bad intentions and I wasn&#039;t scamming him). 2 days later robertbennet420 reply&#039;s in an extremely aggressive manner saying that i&#039;m a scammer so I guess I lost 170 dollars for trying to work things out nicely? It really makes me upset that I did nothing wrong and it fucked me over. All I can do now&nbsp; is hope that the package is someday going to arrive seeing as i&#039;m most likely not getting my refund that I wanted. Does anyone here have any other ideas on what I can do to try and smooth things over?<br /><br /><br />

				what did the resolution center do?&nbsp; if they refund it at least 50/50 it would seem fair because both parties are splitting to loss.&nbsp; I tried to be nice to schizofreen before he left and it isnt worth it.&nbsp; Ask for a refund in the resolution center for what you think is fair and see what happens I always write the vendor a couple days before auto finalization happens and try to figure it out with them and will extend the dead line if possible, but will never ever release the funds unless i have the product in hand how did you lose the 170?

				Alright I submitted a request for a 50% refund this time. There is still 2 days left on my due date so hopefully not all is lost yet. robertbennet420&#039;s first reply was a 2% refund and a post filled with pure rage which is why I was thinking i&#039;m not going to get anything but a few dollars back.

				Take your loss 50%, and move to another vendor.<br />If you are sure you did nothing for the &quot;rage&quot;, then move along.<br />I don&#039;t know the particulars, but most vendors are willing to work with you as long as they don&#039;t see a pattern.<br />Along with risk, we share trust as well.<br />Also don&#039;t forget to review them honestly, with no rage.<br />1/5 with a link to a forum review does nicely ;)<br />Post only once, don&#039;t look like you are on a vendetta.<br />Offer a removal, if attitude changes.......

If he failed to include that in the shipping then he&#039;s the one that failed, not you: he can&#039;t show that the package was successfully delivered and his time is up (it should take no longer than 7-10 days from the time you order to the time the package comes, unless he indicated differently on his vendor page). If he has the DCN but won&#039;t disclose it, then he&#039;s being dishonest and possibly scamming you. 2% is a joke: you paid for something that never showed up, at the very least he can do 50%.

				Ok thanks for the reply&#039;s, if the vendor doesn&#039;t accept the 50% refund will the admins step in to give me a refund when the due time is up?<br /><br />Also I&#039;m sure there wasn&#039;t a DCN on the cheap mail option I choose, seeing as&nbsp; if there was, the vendor would have realized I never received it instead of just assuming it got delivered to me.He seems to think its impossible for mail to get lost.

				hey guess what asshole? its because of people like you that I am no longer vending here. Try searching my account, it&#039;s deleted. assholes like you that try and get free drugs drive us good vendors away. I had a fucking 100% delivery rate including ones going over the border. My packaging was so good its impossible a letter in the SAME FUCKING PROVINCE did not make it. Your most likely not going to get shit back because my account is deleted at my request. Fuck you and stop trying to score free drugs from vendors that work their fucking asses off to get your shit, asshole.

				You know if this vendor could have showed a bit more maturity than a teenage female going through her first bouts of PMS.&nbsp; Maybe we&#039;d feel like we had lost a great asset to the community.&nbsp; But I say good riddance.

				Wow.......<br /><br />Thats why we use DCN&#039;s, to prevent misunderstandings.<br />I&#039;ve had good vendors, and stuff gets lost, we work together.<br />There has to be more to this, because a vendor doesn&#039;t give up after one bad delivery.<br />Vendors, are the scam rates raising from buyers?

				I&#039;m aware we do not know both ends of the story, but I don&#039;t exactly see how OP is a scammer. Let alone, typically when you don&#039;t recieve something usually it&#039;s safer to ask for a refund vs a reship in case anyone is watching you.&nbsp; That&#039;s my paranoid side talking but in all honesty I don&#039;t see how the OP is scamming the vendor.&nbsp;

				Ugh, same here... I&#039;ve been scammed, ripped off and made a fool. I&#039;ve been burned too many times and whenever a package doesn&#039;t arrive I want a refund not a freaking resend from the same guy who failed to send it the first time... It&#039;s always: &quot;Package gets lost 50% refund/free resend, free resend gets lost=no refund!&quot; I&#039;d rather take the first refund than risking to lose it all &lt;.&lt; <br /><br />But I&#039;ve figured out the perfect way to buy drugs :P Use tracked&amp;signature required shipping. That way no one can steal Your letter/box, vendor has to send it out, because there&#039;s proof of it and You can always keep Your eye on it.

				because i believe that the op did receive. also, op stated that &quot;I would like a refund so that i could re-buy the hash&quot;. why not ask for a reship? i believe its because that his intentions were to try to get his money back.

				I asked for a reship and offered to pay for the express option but I never revived a reply which is why I brought it to the resolution center asking for a refund so i could re buy it. I saw nothing wrong with that seeing as I assumed it had gotten lost. I never received a letter from the police or anything saying it was confiscated.

				this thread is kind of fishy with all the inconsistencies plus the fact that OP lives in the same province as the vendor who has good success shipping into the US. I hope this guy wasn&#039;t the tipping point that made him cease vending.

				Alright, I&#039;m not sure how some of you seem to find my story inconsistent so I&#039;m going to lay it out in a nice easy to read point form and with ALL the missing details that I thought seemed pointless to write out. <br /><br />-Placed order<br />-After 1 week it hadn&#039;t arrived, I was a little bit worried since all of the feedback made it seem like I should have gotten it in 5 days or less. I sent a message to the vendor making sure he sent the package and he replied&nbsp; saying how if its marked in transit its been shipped of course.<br />-Waiting. Another week goes by still no package, but I have received 3 of my other orders all from outside of Canada<br />-I get the due date extended by 4 days in the resolution center<br />-Another week has ended and I still don&#039;t have the package<br />-I message the vendor asking if he would be willing to give me a reship.He reads it but does not reply.<br />-I wait 2 days for a reply from the vendor but I never get one<br />-I assume that he wants me to do it officially by getting a refund so I add another resolution for a refund .<br />-The vendor reply&#039;s back(in the resolution center) saying how I&#039;m a scammer and that I must have received my package and says I can have a 2% refund at most.<br />-I submit a 50% refund seeing as I don&#039;t want to loose all my money obviously.<br /><br />Really hate being accused of being a scammer when I know I&#039;m not, but unfortunately there&#039;s not much I can do to prove otherwise.<br /><br />Definitely going to be using the tracking option for big orders from now on to avoid this happening in the future, for all I know the vendor was selectively scamming me and never sent it in the first place, but I&#039;d like to think it just got lost.

				It&#039;s funny, I send letters that aren&#039;t filled with contraband all the time such as bills, birthday cards, gifts, etc and NEVER has ANYTHING ever got lost in the mail but now all of a sudden when their&#039;s drugs very discreetly hidden in the packaging fucking assholes like this OP claim it was &quot;lost&quot; in the mail WHEN HE LIVES 30 MINUTES FROM ME?! OK so if you think I scammed you or it was lost WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU WANT TO REPLACE THE ORDER?&nbsp; you asked for a refund so you can REORDER the package that I supposedly never sent. YOU ARE SO OBVIOUSLY A FUCKING LIAR! You got your half ounce of hash, and now you want your money back so you can have a free half ounce of hash. It makes no sense that you&#039;d ask for your money BACK to REORDER. Why wouldn&#039;t you just ask for a reship? Just so you know YOU were the tipping point of me leaving this place. I had over 200 succsesfull delivery&#039;s going all over Canada and the USA and everyone that was honest loved my products and service but this place is so filled with scamming assholes like you that I just couldn&#039;t take it anymore. Go ask your drug dealer on the street for a refund and see what happens. Oh wait, you never would, because your a fucking pussy hiding behind a computer screen. People like the OP are the reason SO many good vendors never last more than a few months here. Go fuck yourself OP, I never scammed a soul in my life! I have hundreds of customers that can back up how out of my way I went to make sure their transaction went smoothly. You drove a vendor that sold tons of great products away. CONGRADUFUCKINGLATIONS asshole.
