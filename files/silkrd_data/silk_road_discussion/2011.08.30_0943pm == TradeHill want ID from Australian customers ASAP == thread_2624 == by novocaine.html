				Fucking Penthouse magazine are doing an article on SR and they contacted many reputable sellers. I was contacted by them but ignored the request for many reasons. Who knows they are not LE in disguise? And I do not wish to further promote our niche gathering of enthusiasts.

I respect your decision to ignore my request.<br /><br />Here is the story that appeared on The Age website yesterday: http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/riding-the-silk-road-the-flourishing-online-drug-market-authorities-are-powerless-to-stop-20110830-1jj4d.html<br /><br />How does the community feel about how SR is portrayed in this story?

				It&#039;s a fair and balanced article and I especially like reading the comments below the article.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t think the promotion can do any good for SR, the more promotion means more heat for sellers by agencies.

				Yeah but how do you get Moneypak in Australia? Tried to do a bit of research and no luck at all. I&#039;ve gone through TradeHill and they didn&#039;t ask for any form of ID from me. Just deposited an amount directly into their bank account through online banking. The only problem I&#039;m having now is that I have the dollars at World Bitcoin Exchange and although I&#039;m top of the list for amount offered for Bitcoins I still haven&#039;t been able to buy any (been trying for a day now). Has to be something easier ...
