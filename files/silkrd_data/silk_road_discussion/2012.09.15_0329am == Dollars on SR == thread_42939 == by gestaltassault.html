				So I have my SR account set to display dollars. Yesterday I remember having $3.70 something in my account. Today I checked and I have $3.95. I&#039;m not mining so I&#039;m assuming my account is rising with the price of bitcoins...that&#039;s pretty cool...

				Yep.&nbsp; Your account has a set amount of BTC, and the value of BTC in dollars is always varying.&nbsp; So the dollar amount will fluctuate when displayed.
