				Hello SR forum!<br /><br />I am new to silk road, and i have made my first purchase two days ago! the vendor has 100% feedback, almost 100 fans and all the feedback makes him seem trusted.<br /><br />The vendor was selling an ounce of mushrooms capsules, and before he sold out i asked him to hold an ounce for me while i got my money together and bitcoins into silk road. he politely abliged, and gave me a link to (im assuming a private listing) for an ounce of the capsules, so nobody else could buy it. he said i was lucky because he had one ounce left of the capsules. well I put all the money i had left into this, and i bought the capsules and sent him the bitcoins.<br /><br />after two days he has not messaged me back (he usually messaged back within a couple hours) and the order is still in processing. <br /><br />I am unsure of what is happening here, are there any dangers to private listing links? does this sound fishy to anybody?<br /><br />Much love,<br /><br />DeadHead08

				You&#039;re chillin then! Since you stayed in escrow you will have the option of cancelling your order in 4 days if he hasn&#039;t sent them yet.<br /><br />Don&#039;t doubt him yet. There is no indication he is a scammer at this point.

				Haha you&#039;re all set to go man, just wait for the package to come when it says &quot;in transit&quot;<br /><br />When your bitcoins dissapear, they are stored with your transaction and the vendor does not receive the bitcoins until the SR staff or you release them.<br /><br />If he never sends you the 1 oz, take that shit to the resolution center!! NEVER FINALIZE TOO!!

				Bro CALM DOWN!! sometimes it takes vendors 4 or 5 days to mark it in Transit..If he asks u to FE-FINALIZE EARLY, JUST be nice and say i cant do that bro, then i have no protection of my money.. Other than that your good..DO NOT FE!!&nbsp; If 4 or 5 days comes up and cancle becomes available and he has not put it into transit, Msg him and let him know if he isnt gonna do it you would like him to cancel your order, If you cancel your order, you wont get the full amount of BTC back, u will be short a little bit cause SR is gonna keep their % they were gonna charge u for the transaction.. Im pretty sure that i read thats how it works if u cancel, Iv never had to do it. If he Cancels your order then u will get the full amount back.<br /><br />Any members do chime in if i was wrong about what i said if he cancels it he doesnt get every penny back..

What happens is that if the vendor is hedging his escrow account (converting his BTC to USD while they are in escrow, then back to BTC when the orders are finalized) then you will have lost the 4% that this service costs, +/- any change in the value of bitcoin. If the vendor is not hedging his escrow then you will get back the exact amount of bitcoins you paid. They may be worth a different USD amount now though, +/-.

				Sounds like you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t press &quot;finalize&quot; until you get your goods.&nbsp; If the vendor doesn&#039;t accept your order after 4 days, you can cancel and get your btc back.
