				Same here, my account page shows I was last seen 3 days ago and put me in vacation mode some time today. Hope this is resolved soon. I still like vacation mode, just don&#039;t turn it on when we&#039;re not on vacation.

				I was on vacation mode intentionally and it pulled me out. I think it may have just inverted all of the vacation settings

You do realize this is a software issue on a Tor hidden site and everything is being done to fix the situation.<br /><br />I understand your frustration&nbsp; and want it fixed as fast as I am sure you do. But realize DPR is working on it while we speak and it will get fixed. Until then be patient and be cool. <br /><br />Coming into the forums bitching saying things like &quot;took me 2 days to figure out WTF you did&quot; and telling us your customers are complaining and that you are losing money is in no way helping the situation. Again it is a software situation and not something anyone did to you. <br /><br />Also show some respect and realize you are lucky to be here and have this place. It is not a right.<br /><br /><br />
