				God forbid it would ever happen (massive bust that nets almost everyone, buyers, vendors, mods, everyone)<br /><br />but the other day I was thinking...<br /><br />Would it be awesome if we did time in the same prison, an SR Penitentiary. We&#039;d finally see all the colorful characters here from DPR to the forum trolls to those fucking scammers. Haha<br /><br />Discuss

				IDK, that prison would have the most drug entrepreneurs ever.&nbsp; Regardless of how many random searches and drug dog runs, every motherfucker would be all over the place offering 5 kinds of Kush, pills of every strip, chinese fortune papers lacyed with <br />lsd and various mixes of research chemicals, shrooms, rocks, ice, pow-boom-pop.<br /><br />It would be the greatest place to live ever because we&#039;d all be out of our minds ripped on something great and wild exploring the colorful side of life we&#039;ve grown to appreciate.&nbsp; People might try to BREAK-IN to a motherfucking prison run by DPR and the SR boys &amp; girls.<br /><br />I think this prison would also have no incidents of rape or assault.

				We get ADSL and a desktop in our cell right?<br /><br />PS: On a more serious note; I would hope that SR, as well as any well developed darknet site, would have a plan to stay up even after LE intervention.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always envisioned having a mirror site that can be launched if the primary site is compromised.&nbsp; And of course the secondary system admin would have to be of no relation to the person running the primary site.<br />Then again this should be common sense to any determined sys admin.

				Implementing asymmetric encryption to login would seem to add a measure of security but I don&#039;t foresee most users breaking out GPG to encrypt their login credentials before copy/pasting the encrypted block into a login page.&nbsp; Nor does it seem practical for SR to distribute a modified browser that would handle this extra layer of encryption on it&#039;s own.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing the short answer is no, it won&#039;t happen.

				I was thinking more along the lines of a one-time registry thing. <br /><br />You register.. and as part of the registration process you submit a tormail and a pubkey. The system automagically encrypts a verification code with your pubkey and emails it to you. You decrypt and read code, then return to site to input it.<br /><br />&nbsp;System then adds your verified pubkey to your profile. Thereafter your ident is more secured in terms of the system and you talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;I agree that typical logins wouldn&#039;t fly for breaking out the crypto. <br /><br />
