				I heard a story a while ago when a buyer left bad feedback for a vendor. The vendor knew his address obviously and started stalking him. One day when the buyer was coming home, the vendor and few friends of him waited in a van in front of his house. They kidnapped and raped him to death. I heard they were using horse dildos and shit.

				contact SR admins, first of all that sort of behaviour is unacceptable from a vendor, you shoul dbe allowed to give honest feedback without reprisal. In addition he is either lying about having your address as SR deletes it when you click to confirm the order is sent, or he is breaking more SR rules by maintaining a record of his customers.<br /><br />Tell SR admin, bottom right hand corner of the page is support, go via there. Shit drop his name in this thread as a warning to other buyers. This is a 2 way road, buyers got to respect the vendor and the vendor got to respect the buyer.

				We really need more information about the situation from the OP.<br /><br />It&#039;s easy for any of us to say to report and name drop the seller because he does not have our name and address. Perhaps it would be best to first allow us to give advice for a peaceful resolution when we find out more information.

				<br />It&#039;s also easy to talk about peace when your feet are in cold water.<br /><br />Even if the vendor was just waving that &quot;I got your personal info&quot; card, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a &quot;peaceful&quot; resolution here..<br />Why? well other than being blackmailed, this behavior might become a custom for some vendors if SR don&#039;t deal with this kind of thing right away.<br />How would you know that this vendor wouldn&#039;t threaten another user again? and not everyone posts in the forum to look for help, some don&#039;t even know there&#039;s a forum.<br /><br />There&#039;s no way back here for the vendor, you break a big rule, you deal with the consequences.. <br />I say drop his name for the sake of SR, EVEN if the buyer is at fault, you NEVER wave that personal info card to make them give you good feedback or whatever reason, that&#039;s just fucked up..<br />But yes, more info would be nice.<br />

				Completely fucked situation.<br />Vendor shouldn&#039;t have had any trace left of shipping details once shipment(s) had taken place.<br />Extremely unprofessional and unethical in so many aspects.<br /><br />Hope all ends well for you and this poor excuse of a vendor gets what&#039;s coming to them.<br /><br />Maybe a system should be in place that a vendor can only view whom gave &#039;said&#039; feedback after a predetermined number of sales?<br />as it seems it would only be a small time vendor who would be so unprofessional to perform such an act

				When vendors use DCN&#039;s or ship Express..they are going to have the shipping details. At least until you get the package.

And we need vendors more then they need us. There will always be drug buyers..there are few sellers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also we trust them. We have to. And we give them our address. So WE should not talk shit or be an asshole to vendors. If you have a problem act like a decent human and get it resolved. Mistakes will happen and when they do and the vendor fixes it..you shouldn&#039;t be an asshole and leave 4/5.<br /><br />If you order your drugs...and the vendor ships within the 4 days they have...and you receive it and it is what you ordered and the correct amount... YOU SHOULD LEAVE 5/5 EVERY TIME.<br /><br />Most of the vendors we all deal with on a regular basis...are BOSS.

I don&#039;t understand why you are so adamant to state that so many buyers are supposed scamming lying cheating &#039;druggies&#039;. <br /><br /><br />I can say honestly though, fortunately through all my dealings with vendors to date, have been of the utmost professionalism.&nbsp; (Though I do plentiful research before releasing any of my drop addresses to a new vendor which should be common sense/practice ).

Vendors can screw over buyers and vice versa.<br /><br />Sellers can send a package with nothing but rocks in it to the buyer and use that DCN number to claim it was shipped.<br />The buyer can argue all he wants about the rocks, but how will this validate what the seller sent (Seller claims he sent the product, not rocks)<br />&quot;The buyer could have just opened the mail up and replace the product with rocks&quot; - In the minds of SR resolution team.
