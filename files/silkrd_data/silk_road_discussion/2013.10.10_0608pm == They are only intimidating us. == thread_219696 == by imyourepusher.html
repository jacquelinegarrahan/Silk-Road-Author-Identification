				Im counting 10 arrests since the FBI seized our home.<br />So whats going on??? 2 arrests for the USA and 4 in the UK?? its a little pathetic dont you think.<br />And these countries had the most users from what i understand.<br />If the FBI had all our pms and unencrypted addresses&nbsp; there would be more than 2 arrests in the USA for sure.<br />Now everybody has their houses clean and got rid of all the evidence so when they arrest you they don&#039;t have shit on you except some vague assumption that you maybe are that vendor.<br />No drugs, no coins, no package materials. No case.<br />USA is bragging about NOD, while they just intercepted&nbsp; a package&nbsp; that was supposed to be for him.<br />U.K is busting a vendor who was pushing smart drugs hahahahahaha idiots. This guy wasn&#039;t really hiding like the rest of us and even has an online head shop.<br />They cant find the rest of the coins ( only about 575.000 btc) and no associates of DPR were arrested??<br /><br />So my guess is that they are just trying to scare the shit out of us, and when i speak for myself they are doing a good job with that.<br />But when i add everything up it just isn&#039;t making any sense.<br /><br /><br />
