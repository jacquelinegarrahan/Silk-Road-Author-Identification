				Privnote is not and has never been secure. It adds at a minimum two unnecessary attack points and there is no reason to believe it is. I have never accepted privnote links and have never even clicked on a link. Privnote is for amateurs who have no regard for security. NEVER EVER USE PRIVNOTE.

And why would anyone care if you accepted it or not? Why would anyone care if you have clicked on a link or not?<br /><br />Two attack points??&nbsp; WTF?? What if no one is ever going to attack you?<br /><br />Let&#039;s use you as an example.... you never have to use pgp or gpg or Privnote or anything else. As NO ONE will ever care what YOU have to say. The only thing stranger then you coming into this thread and giving your opinion as if someone asked for it.........is that you actually believe that someone one day will be looking into you and what you do. <br /><br />There is a security thread if you want to go swing your dick and talk about what if&#039;s with other paranoid people.<br /><br />Also for 99% of things most people do, Privnote is perfect. You should actually go and read about it and actually know what it really is and how it works, instead of just popping off like you know what you are talking about. Because Privnote is perfect for most things actually. As the FBI computer forensic division is likely not looking into the situation that they are using Privnote for.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also there is a Dateline on NBC right now, you should go watch it and use your security skils to solve the cold case.

				Looks like the domain expired.. Hopefully this does not mean the end of privnote. I agree with RxKing, there were many useful aspects of it. Would be sad to see it go.
