				Sounds like an awful idea.&nbsp; He/They need to keep as far away from the innards as possible and remain overseers. They/He has the most sought after illicit server in the world right now; selling would allow for faster geolocation.<br /><br />Also, they/he make(s) bank as it is now. Vending some weed is chump change.

I was in the process of getting btc to get some way back when, when he abruptly stopped selling. Username was Silkroad. Prices were very cheap at first, I think like $750/lb? Then they kept going up and up, then he stopped. It&#039;s very possible LE could have a rough idea of his location from that time..?

				interesting :) I like learning about the history of SR. Aside from being what feels like my very own personal candy store, I am pretty interested in the deep web, how it all works, security processes etc etc - I have only an average understanding of computers and the net and stuff so I find it all pretty fascinating and interesting. <br /><br />I think DPR is a genius. I think SR is amazing. <br /><br />If only I had the coin and product and fearlessness vendors here do. That is the only thing missing from my silk road journey. I cant imagine the satisfaction one would get from running a successful stall on here. And then, to reach a point of as you say - vend the vendors.... Talk about being top dog!! <br /><br />I wonder if DPR has a 9-5 job IRL or if the road is his full time job....&nbsp;

				Although reading the Forbes article, it looks like the admin Silkroad that was selling shrooms may not have been our current DPR, as there has been a change of hands at some point.
