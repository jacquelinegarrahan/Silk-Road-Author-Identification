				Hi folks. I&#039;m a new vendor, and I&#039;m posting this to see if anyone has had what just happened to me happen at any time. I&#039;ve gotten a number of my first orders over the weekend, and they are packed and ready to ship Monday. Get this: The last order&#039;s money has disappeared from escrow. Gone, as if it never existed. The transaction is still there, which I confirmed, but the money just went away.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been in touch with the buyer for the last couple days anyway, and I&#039;ve let him know I can&#039;t ship until SR support respond to my request to fix the problem. I guess we may have to cancel and then redo the transaction.<br /><br />Any suggestions here similar experiences? This makes me VERY uncomfortable about the entire platform, and some of my business partners, those who were leery of the online avenue in the first place, are livid and ready to walk away. What do you folks think? &gt;:(

				Sounds like you did the right thing so far. <br /><br />All you can do is wait it out til SR admins get back to you. Ive heard of something similiar taking place before and Sr handling it pretty quickly. Hope its solved fast and is a one time thing for you. Ive been watching your listings and im thinking of putting in an order with you in the near future. Hang in there!<br /><br />

				Thanks guys. I think I may understand what has happened now. It appears that most of my transactions, which were not &quot;hedged&quot; (I&#039;d forgotten to select that) are listed in dollars in the escrow section, and the &quot;missing&quot; transaction, which I confirmed AFTER changing my account settings to hedged, is listed in BTC. Am I right? The dollar amount does not seem to be reflected in the BTC amount, in other word, they appear to be different amounts of money, and pretty much equal what I&#039;d expect on each side if I&#039;m right about this. Does anyone know if/why my amounts would be listed in different columns like that? Is it because of hedging?

				I&#039;m shipping everything out today either way, people need to get their stuff. Nothing like this should ever affect our customers. Bump in the road, that&#039;s all, and part of learning our way around.
