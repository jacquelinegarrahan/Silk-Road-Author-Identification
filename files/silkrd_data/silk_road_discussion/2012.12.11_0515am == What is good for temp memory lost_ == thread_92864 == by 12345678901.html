				Hi<br /><br />I need to buy some kind of rufies (SP) or something that will enable a person to loose their memory for a short period of time so then i can do whatever i want to them. They want ti and is part of a sexual fetish we are into.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t know where to go for these sort of things so i thought i would ask SR. <br /><br />Sort of like date rape drug BUT i am doing no raping. It&#039;s hard to explain but it&#039;s legit.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I have no personal experience with it, but GHB was definitely used in a TV soap date-rape storyline that I saw. Rohypnol is the other infamous date rape drug afaik.

				I agree with RoxiPal, Scopolamine is definitely what you&#039;re looking for. I&#039;ve seen it on the road a couple of times. Be careful though, a little goes a long way and it&#039;s very easy to accidentally dose yourself.

				Let me get this straight, you want to drug your own GF so that you can rape her and she will no recollection next day.<br /><br />Why not just give your GF 2 tic tacs, wait for her to fall asleep and then make something up the next morning?<br /><br />Its not like she can catch you out by not remembering, is it?

Personally I don&#039;t think this is really where the OP wants to go. Scopolamine is very serious stuff - not for casual use at all. Ayahuasqueros in the Amazon will generally apprentice for years before they will start incorporating the Brugmansias into their shamanic work. So IMHO not actually recommended for this particular fantasy...<br /><br />BG<br />
