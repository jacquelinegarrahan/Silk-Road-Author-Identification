				So, after privnote was down all day yesterday i noticed today now at the top it says &quot;Javascript is required to use Privnote&quot;. I looked through the source and there is nothing pointing to an exploit, but there is now an extra re-direct after creating the note and you can see this if you watch the live headers. This would be very beneficial to authorities if they can get the true IP of privnotes users and linking up the notes they find to users. Its possible the message was always there but i have never had javascript enabled, and now it is required? there method of submitting the form and making the note does not need JS, so why is it required? What do you guys think?<br /><br /><br />Alternative:<br /><br />https://thismessagewillselfdestruct.com<br /><br />This seems secure, and just as good as privnote. It even has some extra features privnote does not have. No this is not my site, it is just a heads up to keep people safe, im sure there are other similar ones too but most seem to expire after time, not after reading.<br /><br />

				Privnote, SMS4TOR and all similar sites are not safe at all... Just use PGP, it&#039;s not much harder.

				Oh trust me, i use PGP, always have. But privnote is a good accent to PGP and some un-informed buyers use it exclusively, and to reply to them without their public key then privnote is a good tool. In no way is it secure, but it has its place.

				Deadletter is another. <br /><br />http://dead6nxjwxfejydb.onion/#/<br /><br />Don&#039;t know if it&#039;s still operational or if it requires javascript.
