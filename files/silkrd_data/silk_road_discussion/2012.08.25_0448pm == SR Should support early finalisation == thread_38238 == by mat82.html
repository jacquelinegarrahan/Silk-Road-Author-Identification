				I realise that SR is against early finalisation, and personally I think it&#039;s a pretty awful idea for all concerned. However the reality is that vendors are likely to want it in some circumstances for a while yet.<br /><br />The advantages of supporting an FE process are:<br />&nbsp;- Sellers wouldn&#039;t get ratings from FE transactions until they delivered.<br />&nbsp;- Buyers could see how many transactions the seller did via early finalisation.<br />&nbsp;- Some of these stats could be used as leverage to make seller scamming harder (or at least easier to spot).<br />I&#039;m sure there are more...<br /><br />I hope one day the market is big enough that there will always be enough vendors willing to ship without early finalisation - at least for small quantities. Until then it should be condemned but kept on the radar.

				Are you crazy mate? Why would anyone support a FE process when the Escrow system here works just fine when used correctly. We need to keep pushing the message and educating people on having some respect and consideration for vendors using the Escrow system. As a buyer, if&nbsp; the vendor has done the right thing by me in sending me what I ordered, I then make it a priority to immediately finalize the order in question, which to tell you the truth, makes me a happy camper knowing I did the right thing and forfilled my end of the agreement. If we can focus on making someone other than ourselves happy, what you&#039;ll receive in return will be a satisfaction level once thought by you to not be reachable. Keeping each other happy in regards to a transaction is a fairly simple process and will only sour if one of the parties involved circums to thoughts of greed and the insatiable thirst for wanting more.

				The thing is, you can bury your head in the sand and scream &quot;No FE&quot; all you like - it still happens.<br /><br />At least if you bring it above board it will help a bit. Sellers wouldn&#039;t get a &#039;free&#039; 5/5 rating until they actually delivered. You could even go so far as to show how much risk sellers had in a FE state to help spot potential scams building up.<br /><br />I&#039;m not suggesting FE should be condoned in any way, but saying &quot;don&#039;t do it&quot; and then washing your hands of the problem, well it&#039;s about as effective as saying &quot;drugs are bad m&#039;kay&quot; in terms of prevent problems.

				I am AN Oil vendor &amp; pills vendor I DO NOT ASK anyone to FE That is stupid business.I feel if a person wants a vendors page they should have enough stock to last 21 days so then there cash will start rolling in faster.If vendors would spend a little extra for there buyers and get them tracking #&#039;s at the vendors costs you know exactly when they receive the parcel &amp; you can contact them for your payment I think SR should change the auto-finalize so when the buyer recieves his parcel the vendor can forward the tracking # to SR &amp; they can finalize the transaction for the buyer

				I think it is strange what a 180 silk road has caused in the drug scene. Prior to SR if customers expected vendors to send them product before they sent them money , they would have been laughed at by everyone. Now it is exactly the opposite. Seems like it switches the risk of being scammed from customers to vendors.

				one of the reason&#039;s why i dont like the FE is because it seemd to me that EVERY VENDOR ON SR HAS 3 TO 4 PAGES OF &quot;FE will update when i test product&quot;&nbsp; ans they NEVER DO... so as a BUYER.. u have to go off all these &quot;FE&#039;S WILL UPDATE AFTER TRYING PRODUCT&quot; and the only thing you really find out about the seller is if he/she has good shipping/contact skills...
