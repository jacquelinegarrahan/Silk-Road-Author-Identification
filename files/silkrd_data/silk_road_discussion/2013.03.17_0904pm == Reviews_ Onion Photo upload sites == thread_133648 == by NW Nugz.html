				That sounds like good advice wretched. I have an FH (Freedom Hosting) site now and plan to figure out how to add photo&#039;s to it. That may be more trouble than buyers want to go to to put up a few pictures though. So, I&#039;d guess a need for open hosting sites would still exist and be worth reviewing here.<br /><br />I&#039;d also like to hear comments on how to make a FH site into a personal photo upload site. I suppose it is website building basics and I ought to learn that elsewhere? If there are &quot;modules&quot; or approaches or&nbsp; ... that I can add to my FH site or something like that, maybe people can recommend their favorites.

				I like this one as well: <br /><br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/<br /><br />However it definitely doesn&#039;t beat the one that allows multiple file uploads.<br />I noticed that it also accepts other filetypes besides images.
