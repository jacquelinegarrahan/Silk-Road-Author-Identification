				Both Reuters and the AP have confirmed this story. DPR has been arrested and will be charged in New York. It&#039;s all over. Now come the bad times.

				So basically my coins are gone(don&#039;t mind this as much as the site being gone :/)<br /><br />Bmr is going to be worthless cause we are going to overload there servers<br /><br />And were looking at say alteast two months before we can get a legit marketplace thats halfway decent<br /><br />I&#039;m decently stocked but not heavily stocked :(

				Well have they seized both the servers and domain, or just domain?<br />If they haven&#039;t seized the servers I am still clinging onto hope that another one of the admins is able to take over and sort this mess. DPR always talked about back-up plans, I just hope that he planned for this and someone is able to bring the Silk Road back up again. <br />

				The original DPR is still out there ... <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Investigators said Mr Ulbricht then went on to &quot;buy out&quot; Silk Road, which had already been set up by someone else.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just hoping some one of the admins or even the original DPR has access to the servers and bring it all back up again, it looks like the FBI has only seized the domain.

				Man the original DPR must be pretty angry, I know I would be, damn, still trying to gather what I should be doing right now. Get gun, get weed, go to woods with tent, smoke drink, shoot any bastards who disagree with me...

There are no domains in onionland, and LE has supposedly had some level of access to the servers since the beginning. Assume all your correspondence (PMs, SR messages, addresses, etc) have been compromised unless you used PGP.
