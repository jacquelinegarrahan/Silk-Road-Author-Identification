				Hey gang,<br /><br />I read more than I post in the forum, and my posts are rarely of a personal nature.&nbsp; For some reason the mood struck me just now to put the revolution down for a minute and just express a few things.&nbsp; There is a curtain of anonymity and secrecy that covers everything that goes on behind the scenes here.&nbsp; It is often fast paced and stressful behind this curtain and I rarely lift my head long enough to take in just how amazing all of this is.&nbsp; But when I do I am filled with inspiration and hope for the future.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a little story about what inspires me:<br /><br />For years I was frustrated and defeated by what seemed to be insurmountable barriers between the world today and the world I wanted.&nbsp; I searched long and hard for the truth about what is right and wrong and good for humanity.&nbsp; I argued with, learned from, and read the works of brilliant people in search of the truth.&nbsp; It&#039;s a damn hard thing to do too with all of the misinformation and distractions in the sea of opinion we live in.&nbsp; But eventually I found something I could agree with whole heartedly.&nbsp; Something that made sense, was simple, elegant and consistent in all cases.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about the Austrian Economic theory, voluntaryism, anarcho-capitalism, agorism etc. espoused by the likes of Mises and Rothbard before their deaths, and Salerno and Rockwell today.<br /><br />From their works, I understood the mechanics of liberty, and the effects of tyranny.&nbsp; But such vision was a curse.&nbsp; Everywhere I looked I saw the State, and the horrible withering effects it had on the human spirit.&nbsp; It was horribly depressing.&nbsp; Like waking from a restless dream to find yourself in a cage with no way out.&nbsp; But I also saw free spirits trying to break free of their chains, doing everything they could to serve their fellow man and provide for themselves and their loved ones.&nbsp; I saw the magical and powerful wealth creating effect of the market, the way it fostered cooperation, civility and tolerance.&nbsp; How it made trading partners out of strangers or even enemies.&nbsp; How it coordinates the actions of every person on the planet in ways too complex for any one mind to fathom to produce an overflowing abundance of wealth, where nothing is wasted and where power and responsibility are directed to those most deserving and able.&nbsp; I saw a better way, but knew of no way to get there.<br /><br />I read everything I could to deepen my understanding of economics and liberty, but it was all intellectual, there was no call to action except to tell the people around me what I had learned and hopefully get them to see the light.&nbsp; That was until I read “Alongside night” and the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III.&nbsp; At last the missing puzzle piece!&nbsp; All of the sudden it was so clear:&nbsp; every action you take outside the scope of government control strengthens the market and weakens the state.&nbsp; I saw how the state lives parasitically off the productive people of the world, and how quickly it would crumble if it didn&#039;t have it&#039;s tax revenues.&nbsp; No soldiers if you can&#039;t pay them.&nbsp; No drug war without billions of dollars being siphoned off the very people you are oppressing.<br /><br />For the first time I saw the drug cartels and the dealers, and every person in the whole damn supply chain in a different light.&nbsp; Some, especially the cartels, are basically a defacto violent power hungry state, and surely would love nothing more than to take control of a national government, but you average joe pot dealer, who wouldn&#039;t hurt a fly, that guy became my hero.&nbsp; By making his living outside the purview of the state, he was depriving it of his precious life force, the product of his efforts. He was free.&nbsp; People like him, little by little, weakened the state and strengthened the market.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t long, maybe a year or two after this realization that the pieces started coming together for the Silk Road, and what a ride it has been.&nbsp; No longer do I feel ANY frustration.&nbsp; In fact I am at peace in the knowledge that every day I have more I can do to breath life into a truly revolutionary and free market than I have hours in the day.&nbsp; I walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive.<br /><br />We are like a little seed in a big jungle that has just broken the surface of the forest floor.&nbsp; It&#039;s a big scary jungle with lots of dangerous creatures, each honed by evolution to survive in the hostile environment known as human society.&nbsp; All manner of corporation, government agency, small family businesses, anything that can gain a foothold and survive.&nbsp; But the environment is rapidly changing and the jungle has never seen a species quite like the Silk Road.&nbsp; You can see it, but you can&#039;t touch it.&nbsp; It is elusive, yet powerful, and we are evolving at a rapid clip, experimenting, trying to find sturdy ground we can put roots down in.<br /><br />Will we and others like us someday grow to be tall hardwoods?&nbsp; Will we reshape the landscape of society as we know it?&nbsp; What if one day we had enough power to maintain a physical presence on the globe, where we shunned the parasites and upheld the rule of law, where the right to privacy and property was unquestioned and enshrined in the very structure of society.&nbsp; Where police are our servants and protectors beholden to their customers, the people.&nbsp; Where our leaders earn their power and responsibility in the harsh and unforgiving furnace of the free market and not from behind a gun, where the opportunities to create and enjoy wealth are as boundless as one&#039;s imagination.<br /><br />Some day, we could be a shining beacon of hope for the oppressed people of the world just as so many oppressed and violated souls have found refuge here already.&nbsp; Will it happen overnight?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Will it happen in a lifetime?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Is it worth fighting for until my last breath.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve seen what&#039;s possible, how can you do otherwise?&nbsp; How can you plug yourself into the tax eating, life sucking, violent, sadistic, war mongering, oppressive machine ever again?&nbsp; How can you kneel when you&#039;ve felt the power of your own legs?&nbsp; Felt them stretch and flex as you learn to walk and think as a free person?&nbsp; I would rather live my life in rags now than in golden chains.&nbsp; And now we can have both!&nbsp; Now it is profitable to throw off one&#039;s chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically.&nbsp; How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets?&nbsp; The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips!<br /><br />I have no one to share my thoughts with in physical space.&nbsp; Security does not permit it, so thanks for listening.&nbsp; I hope my words can be an inspiration just as I am given so much by everyone here.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts

				The revolution will not be televised! We are part of a great experiement happening right NOW. The fact that we are not in the plugged in control structure so many of our family and friends are in. We see something off in the distance that is not personal, but is for all, we just need enough peope to help push our consciouness through to the next level. Here at SR we ARE the faciliitators, and not just that, but QUALITY is a big cocern of mine, always has been. Well here at SR there is some accountability to your Quality. I love it. WE just have to see where this ship goes and how well we can all work together if anything happens.<br /><br />Viva La SR!

You really are a hero to myself and many others, DPR. Defending liberty and freedom instead of giving them up in exchange for governmental &quot;guarantees&quot; despite a world filled with opposing forces. I love how this is a global market where exchange of information and goods happens so quickly and easily even with large distances between us. This market is truly an amazing revolution to be a part of.

				This is all awesomely said. <br /><br />but i think the sword of damocles hanging over silk road&#039;s head is bitcoins! lol. don&#039;t laugh, yo. i&#039;m serious. <br /><br />silk road&#039;s survival hinges on bitcoins which have been under attack. yeah, drama, i know. but tradehill got shot in the face. banks are making life difficult to deposit to bitcoin dealers. bank of america seems to be smartening up. <br /><br />so you know what? the powers that be are gonna be like, you think you are starving out beast? well we&#039;ll starve yours. say bubbye to bitcoins. we&#039;re going to regulate the shit out of it all in the name of protecting the public from being scammed. chest all puffed out and shit. then they&#039;ll be like, &quot;we&#039;ve been holding shit down since the down of time. ain&#039;t a bitch rise up unless we say so.&quot; <br /><br />so that&#039;s my worry. they&#039;ll attack the currency used by silk roaders instead of attacking silk road. then force everyone back to using moneypaks to buy drugs and being scammed. unless you can escrow moneypaks? <br /><br />hey, DPR, you might want to think about doing that. Make moneypaks acceptable form of payment but with some kind of escrow. would be more stable than bitcoins.

				From time to time when I&#039;m browsing around on this place, I&#039;ll suddenly sit back and the biggest shit eating grin will cross my face as I realize yet again how unique and amazing it is. For me it&#039;s a dream come true. I grew up on the Internet and was always fascinated by it&#039;s potential to connect like minds and spread knowledge that gradually weakens the propaganda and misinformation Big Brother forces down people&#039;s throats to keep them in line. Though I was fascinated by these possibilities, I never would have connected the dots with Tor and BTC in being able to create something like this myself. For that I am grateful for admin&#039;s work and have been deeply inspired by this place. Even if SR does not succeed as an enterprise I&#039;m certain that the dream will live on and take an even more robust form, and in that sense it has been a huge success already. It&#039;s laudable that DPR seems to value this over simply lining his pockets (although there&#039;s certainly nothing wrong with that in my book). <br /><br />Deep respect here, forever. I&#039;m with you brother. I&#039;m sure it must be a lonely existence in a number of respects, and I recognize and thank you for your personal sacrifices that make this possible.

				Very motivating and inspirational to me. Thanks.<br />I feel the power we all have when we securely seal up that envelop to ship out, or when we eagerly wait to tear it open to see whats inside. This truly is a direct action. SR provokes new buyers to purchase from a REAL chemist or grower, not from mega drug cartels funded by governments. In return, supporting the sellers will result in a truly free market which expands the choices of the buyers.<br />It&#039;s a beautiful thing that is happening here. I see it much more than just a way of getting banned products. Its a way to fight off corruption and evil in this world and show these tyrants who&#039;s boss!...we the people!

Those books mentioned are works of fiction, it is interesting that it should take these fiction elements in combination with the rigorous theory of Austrian economics to make it all work together, to make it all work in a practical way. A greater than sum of parts interaction between right and left brain hemispheres perhaps! Only then could the rubber truly meet the road. Capitalist philosophy is in fact extremely practical once you &quot;get it&quot;, but it is often non trivial to understand why and how. It is a mere 236 years since our Revolution began, nothing!, but I&#039;m not sure we all, myself included, fully appreciate the implications and power of this idea. It has a similar vastness to the theory of Evolution, if you require Deep Time to comprehend Evolution, then you need Deep Thought to comprehend Capitalism. It is almost Zen-like, apparently simple rules hide tremendous complexity. Have you read the Wealth of Nations and Adam Smith&#039;s description of what it takes to put a coarse woolen garment on the back of a shepherd, or the account of how production expands even in the simple process of a pin manufacture? That hit me like a gunshot to the head, I understood how Saul from Damascus felt, like a mental lighting bolt penetrating your mind and completely reordering everything. There is no better high than this, there really is not.<br /><br />Since coming to SR, it may sound cliched or peculiar, but I have felt a great sense of peace. It is just as you say, like a final jigsaw piece clicked into place, like the observation of the emergence of a larger pattern or grasping the solution to a perplexing riddle. It is inexplicable but satisfying.<br /><br />This is a war worth fighting. We have the opportunity to unleash the power of the market directly against the Enemy.<br /><br />On my part, I shall throw every resource at my disposal, every inkling of intellect and once of strength into this fight. These mediocre minded men with meager intellect and barren spirits cannot stand in our way. In the end, the Market, shall triumph. <br /><br />This new generation of young people of the early 21st century, they are the most important ones, because, it is their future that has been stolen by corrupt politicians, quasi-fascist-socialist designs. SR and the emerging Darknet Confederation is going to be one of those pivots where we slam our feet back against the bedrock of this society and shove back hard. <br /><br />Perhaps I will be considered a lunatic but I believe real world War could be coming. Yes, the real thing. My intuition says that we, not SR or the darknet markets, but the entirety of the West, is on an awful yawning precipice that could lead to catastrophic economic, followed by political and social disaster. Perhaps that doesn&#039;t sound very scientific, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;m the only one with that vibe. There is never a way of predicting the future, so my intuition is as good a metric as any, and I have to say it has not let me down yet. Our anonymous comms networks, our financial system will stand us in good stead if such a time comes.

				Thank you DPR. I can only imagine how scary it was originally setting this up. You are a shining example of liberty for all of us to follow. While some trends on the internet increase liberty, many trends in meatspace are moving to be solidified socialist, totalitarian, and anti-freedom. The statists never rest but neither do we. It is a cosmic battle which we are destined to win. It is getting to the point of being intolerable. We cannot as humans allow others who claim to be humans to allow their corrupted conscience to enforce corporate morality. Our solutions will probably not be found in the current regulatory democracy, designed to reinforce the system. <br /><br />Regards WWIII, it is coming. I think the gods are returning, and they aren&#039;t happy, at least to some groups on this planet.

Thank-you Tim-Berners Lee (inventor of the internet), thank-you to the military personnel who invented the Tor Network, and a massive THANK-YOU to DPR for bringing it all together in the most revolutionary of ways! Thank-you, thank-you, and thank-you!<br /><br />The SRevolution as well and truly landed. Here, on SR, we are in the true &quot;land of the free&quot;, and long may it continue!

The wheel has turned and all the power in the world is surging beneath our feet, economics and demographics. The Darknet Black Markets are going to become a permanent fixture to this world one way or the other. I also suggest reading about &quot;System D&quot;, there is an excellent article in Foreign Policy called &quot;The Shadow Superpower&quot; on the subject, I think it is quite revealing.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35057.msg399817#msg399817">Quote from: InkIndulgence on August 10, 2012, 04:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Today at the office was someone&#039;s birthday. AGAIN. I went and picked up their cake from the bakery, vanilla with vanilla frosting. AGAIN. We all piled in the conference room and mumbled the Happy Birthday song, clapped, and pretended to laugh at the same crappy jokes about getting older. AGAIN. I swear to god someone has a birthday every goddamn week. Eating cake and ice cream every week for years it&#039;s a wonder I&#039;m not 300lbs.<br /><br />As I was cutting the cake, looking at the room full of morbidly obese, visibly exhausted and saggy-eyed people eagerly staring at the giant sugary loaf like hungry hyenas as the one highlight in their day, I couldn&#039;t help but think &quot;God, am I going to be standing here doing this when I&#039;m 30, 40, 50, 60?!&quot; and for some reason it really bothered me. <br /><br />I mean, if you happen to be &quot;lucky&quot; enough to procure a &quot;normal&quot; 8-5 job, or hell even at fast food jobs or whatever, you spend majority of your waking hours during the week being there, doing something you probably barely like, maybe you get paid well, maybe you don&#039;t. And there is no end in sight. If you have a kid, then you get a few months off and then have to put them in daycare or something and go back. <br /><br />It just worries me because I&#039;m only in my mid-20s and already feeling this way of the working world, I am one of the youngest people at my workplace. I swear my day life is exactly like the movie Office Space. Probably why I do drugs. I just wish there was some other way, and I guess there are plenty of people out there who have their own business or some crazy cool job like traveling the world, or are super lucky and somehow are rich enough to not have to work, but for the majority of us, that will not happen. If I want a nice house, nice things, etc this is how it has to be. <br /><br />Does this bother anyone else? How do you deal with it? Do you ever wake up at 7am like usual and for some reason the very last thing you want to do is go to work? Or am I just messed up or naive. <br /><br />It&#039;s not that I&#039;m completely miserable, I do like my job for the most part, but some days like today I just get in this depressive funk where I look at the big picture and get uncomfortable with it... and when I graduate college soon I&#039;ll still be doing this, maybe somewhere else one day for more money but the same picture.<br /><br />Anyway sorry to bring down the mood on here but I have to put on the happy mask all day everyday to my real life people, I like being able to come on here and just say how I feel.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35057.msg400041#msg400041">Quote from: pine on August 10, 2012, 07:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s posts like these that make me glad I&#039;m an international drug smuggler. Today&#039;s wages for young people, even ones with advanced degrees are beyond crap. I see new grads paying to work internships because the cost of living is higher than their stipends, even when they live with their parents or half a dozen+ to a house. Then when they obtain a real salary it&#039;s 5 times lower than it was 20 years ago in real terms (i.e. w/o inflation), taxed to the hilt and then some. My taxi driver and waiter have decent STEM degrees these days and a 50-100k of student debt and a sob story to tell, it&#039;s completely ridiculous. It&#039;s somewhat hilarious that they imagine somebody like myself is taking burdensome risks when the opportunity cost of &#039;normality&#039; has wrecked their prospects. Mind you, all our competition is of the &#039;Topix&#039; variety, so I can see how you&#039;d get that impression. <br /><br />But seriously, young people today aren&#039;t thinking about ROI, return on investment. They seem to think it&#039;s alright to be in debt until your late 30s or more before they get back into the black. Then they take on mortgages because everybody else is doing it. That&#039;s not OK, that&#039;s shit. Do the math. You guys should be rioting or something by now, I don&#039;t know what is wrong with this generation, I genuinely am surprised they aren&#039;t far more angry. I mean are you getting a raw deal or not? If so, maybe you need to plan something new. I don&#039;t know what, that&#039;s hardly my business, but there&#039;s no point in sitting around moping about things if you&#039;re not going to do something about it. Make a business plan or something, take some control over your life in some way. <br /><br />Example: If you work hard and invest consistently for long periods of time while you&#039;re younger, then you can accumulate wealth much faster than your peers. You&#039;ll know you&#039;re successful when your yearly dividends are higher than your annual salary. Your pals may have nice cars or houses, but they&#039;ll also be in debt up to their eyeballs. Don&#039;t go down that road, it&#039;s well trodden, and an infinitely sterile and anxiety filled way to live life.<br /><br />If you want to escape the rat race, you have to think laterally and take calculated risks, whether you are in the black market or regular market that is the case. You cannot follow the herd, they thought investing in real estate in 2007 was a hot idea. Fuck those people, don&#039;t take advice from anybody who isn&#039;t already ahead of you in some area. Do your research, make a plan, like you were making a report for your boss, but for yourself.<br /><br />Finally, a lot of young people look down on jobs like working a shop floor, pizza delivery, cleaning etc. Those jobs may not pay top dollar, but they aren&#039;t going to get outsourced to china now are they? Contrariwise, most classical middle class jobs like engineering, legal, payroll, is experiencing just that thanks to the combined effects of globalization and new technology. Looks like the plumber makes more money than my dentist or lawyer when you factor in their opportunity costs and supply/demand of labor. Work hard at whatever you do, obtain capital (you&#039;re still in the West, it&#039;s still much easier here than elsewhere), and then do something with it that puts you in control. Ownership of capital and income from said capital is the key thing to obtaining independence.<br /><br />tldr; Your parents had no idea what the fuck they are talking about. Traditional concepts like working for two or three corporations in your life time, even obtaining a mortgage, are flying out the window, it&#039;s just going to take some time for everybody to cotton on. What has happened is that supply and demand has dramatically changed, but not everybody gets it yet, least of all the educational establishments or your average 30/40 something. They think it&#039;s going to change &quot;after the recession&quot;. No, it ain&#039;t. Wages are going to be like this from here on out. This implies either a massive deflation in house prices or you guys will be renting for the rest of your lives. Since your parents were dumbassed enough to put all their savings into real estate capital accumulation strategies and are now hanging on like frightened rabbits, it&#039;s probably the second for a while at least. I mean seriously, do the actual math for your average 20 something, that&#039;s what it is for most of them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				DPR, I swear to god every time I read a post of yours I fall in love a little bit more. Seriously, if this site was run by anyone else, I have a feeling it would be shitty and would fit in nicely with the other bullshit drug-selling sites. Your philosophy follows mine basically 100%. Some people really don&#039;t think that anyone can do anything for unselfish reasons. Like for example, I sell some MDMA on the side, and I always give first-time users a huge discount because it generally makes me happy to watch these people experience this amazing feeling that they never see coming. But I have some people who are like, &quot;Dude, you&#039;re obviously just trying to get people hooked to make more money in the long run.&quot; It&#039;s just unbelievable. People like to think that all drug users/sellers are selfish scumbags, but that&#039;s basically missing the entire point of using certain drugs. It&#039;s a mindset difficult to get out of, but you and your amazing website are doing something about it. I mean, look at that 4/20 sale. I&#039;m sure the additional sales increased your commission, but you gave away like items that totalled were worth thousands of Bitcoins, and you gave someone an awesome vacation. You didn&#039;t need to do that. Maybe it got new customers interested or something, but I could just tell reading all your posts about it that you were legitimately excited to help out your customers. And it was awesome. You&#039;re awesome. Fuck, that&#039;s it, you&#039;re just fucking awesome. I feel about you the way I feel about strangers when I&#039;m rolling.

				DPR is a job-creator, period.&nbsp; Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, blah blah whatever flavor of blabbering politician you like, they&#039;re all jizzing in their pants all the time about these *godsends,* these *heroes* who create jobs for *hard-working* Americans.&nbsp; They should love them the dread pirate.<br /><br />The ILF finds the part about buying better food and new clothes -- and being more generous! -- really telling and sweet.&nbsp; Because &quot;lifestyle&quot; isn&#039;t really, in the end, about how you spend your money.&nbsp; It&#039;s about how you spend your time, and if you can spend it doing meaningful things, or even just meaningful to you, then your lifestyle HAS changed, dramatically so.&nbsp; If you can make the same amount of money doing something you want to do as you were making at your slave job, then the choice is clear.&nbsp; Heck, it&#039;s probably worth it to make LESS doing something you want than at your slave job!&nbsp; But if you can make more, how cool is that?<br /><br />ZOMG we are kind of nervous just writing this, in part because words are too limited, not enough, to even express what is going on here on the Road.&nbsp; We wish we could give the Dread Pirate and crew, all the vendors, and all the buyers -- especially those who have bought from us, lol -- everybody, just a huge fucking hug.&nbsp; It&#039;s sad we can&#039;t interact in the way humans have for millenia, but it&#039;s the State who is stopping that.&nbsp; Still, the first time one of the ILF took E, and many times since on E or mushrooms or cactus etc., he felt that he was part of some global, nay, universal underground.&nbsp; It&#039;s palpable.&nbsp; Whether the Mysteries of Eleusis of the East or the sacred mushroom and cactus ceremonies of the West, there is a communication going on here that transcends any words typed on a screen.&nbsp; And we pray *that* cannot be stopped.&nbsp; All the laws and all the oppression and all the violence cannot drive us out.<br /><br />Madison Avenue can&#039;t advertise them, Walmart can&#039;t sell them, and the people who are involved with them are always in danger of draconian punishments, yet the demand for and use of entheogens is still huge.&nbsp; What does that say about their value?<br /><br />So true about the feeling of peace that comes from doing something that you believe is truly a part of something healing, something beautiful, for yourself AND other people.&nbsp; Also so true that it&#039;s a bit de-realizing not being able to talk about it in the physical world.&nbsp; When someone, to make small talk, asks what you did today, it&#039;s crazy having to live with the fear that telling the truth could lead to your whole life crumbling.&nbsp; But that&#039;s the bargain, and it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; And that&#039;s a huge part of what makes this community so special -- because here we can talk about it.&nbsp; And even if it did all crumble tomorrow (and in the end, death will come anyway), everyone that&#039;s a part of SR, everyone that&#039;s been a part of any struggle for freedom, can go out knowing that s/he was a part of something beautiful, can tell the higher Judge that s/he answers to that s/he said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br /><br />This place, this community, is *direct action*.&nbsp; We aren&#039;t just talking about how to change the world; we&#039;re doing it!<br /><br />Love y&#039;all!

				When I joined this site I was shocked, people selling drugs online? Yeah okay, where do I enter my social security number? Then I entered the community and immediately got sucked in, made my first purchases from overseas and they arrived professionally packed, I was amazed. I wanted to become a part of this movement so I decided to become a seller and offer my medical marijuana edibles, I didn&#039;t think people would have much interest because no one was even selling edibles (except willywonka and his wonderful candies). Then my edibles blew up and I could barely handle the demand, it really made an impact on my life because like you DPR my intentions from the beginning were never to make wealth but rather to share my creations (with the help of the baker of course). It was great knowing that I was helping people with cancer across the country that didn&#039;t have medical marijuana available or just helping people out having a hard time.<br /><br />Thank you DPR, DigitalAlch, the rest of the admins, and most importantly the community, both buyers and vendors!

For some reason the mood struck me just now to put the revolution down for a minute and just express a few things.&nbsp; There is a curtain of anonymity and secrecy that covers everything that goes on behind the scenes here.&nbsp; It is often fast paced and stressful behind this curtain and I rarely lift my head long enough to take in just how amazing all of this is.&nbsp; But when I do I am filled with inspiration and hope for the future.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a little story about what inspires me:<br /><br />For years I was frustrated and defeated by what seemed to be insurmountable barriers between the world today and the world I wanted.&nbsp; I searched long and hard for the truth about what is right and wrong and good for humanity.&nbsp; I argued with, learned from, and read the works of brilliant people in search of the truth.&nbsp; It&#039;s a damn hard thing to do too with all of the misinformation and distractions in the sea of opinion we live in.&nbsp; But eventually I found something I could agree with whole heartedly.&nbsp; Something that made sense, was simple, elegant and consistent in all cases.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about the Austrian Economic theory, voluntaryism, anarcho-capitalism, agorism etc. espoused by the likes of Mises and Rothbard before their deaths, and Salerno and Rockwell today.<br /><br />From their works, I understood the mechanics of liberty, and the effects of tyranny.&nbsp; But such vision was a curse.&nbsp; Everywhere I looked I saw the State, and the horrible withering effects it had on the human spirit.&nbsp; It was horribly depressing.&nbsp; Like waking from a restless dream to find yourself in a cage with no way out.&nbsp; But I also saw free spirits trying to break free of their chains, doing everything they could to serve their fellow man and provide for themselves and their loved ones.&nbsp; I saw the magical and powerful wealth creating effect of the market, the way it fostered cooperation, civility and tolerance.&nbsp; How it made trading partners out of strangers or even enemies.&nbsp; How it coordinates the actions of every person on the planet in ways too complex for any one mind to fathom to produce an overflowing abundance of wealth, where nothing is wasted and where power and responsibility are directed to those most deserving and able.&nbsp; I saw a better way, but knew of no way to get there.<br /><br />I read everything I could to deepen my understanding of economics and liberty, but it was all intellectual, there was no call to action except to tell the people around me what I had learned and hopefully get them to see the light.&nbsp; That was until I read “Alongside night” and the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III.&nbsp; At last the missing puzzle piece!&nbsp; All of the sudden it was so clear:&nbsp; every action you take outside the scope of government control strengthens the market and weakens the state.&nbsp; I saw how the state lives parasitically off the productive people of the world, and how quickly it would crumble if it didn&#039;t have it&#039;s tax revenues.&nbsp; No soldiers if you can&#039;t pay them.&nbsp; No drug war without billions of dollars being siphoned off the very people you are oppressing.<br /><br />For the first time I saw the drug cartels and the dealers, and every person in the whole damn supply chain in a different light.&nbsp; Some, especially the cartels, are basically a defacto violent power hungry state, and surely would love nothing more than to take control of a national government, but you average joe pot dealer, who wouldn&#039;t hurt a fly, that guy became my hero.&nbsp; By making his living outside the purview of the state, he was depriving it of his precious life force, the product of his efforts. He was free.&nbsp; People like him, little by little, weakened the state and strengthened the market.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t long, maybe a year or two after this realization that the pieces started coming together for the Silk Road, and what a ride it has been.&nbsp; No longer do I feel ANY frustration.&nbsp; In fact I am at peace in the knowledge that every day I have more I can do to breath life into a truly revolutionary and free market than I have hours in the day.&nbsp; I walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive.<br /><br />We are like a little seed in a big jungle that has just broken the surface of the forest floor.&nbsp; It&#039;s a big scary jungle with lots of dangerous creatures, each honed by evolution to survive in the hostile environment known as human society.&nbsp; All manner of corporation, government agency, small family businesses, anything that can gain a foothold and survive.&nbsp; But the environment is rapidly changing and the jungle has never seen a species quite like the Silk Road.&nbsp; You can see it, but you can&#039;t touch it.&nbsp; It is elusive, yet powerful, and we are evolving at a rapid clip, experimenting, trying to find sturdy ground we can put roots down in.<br /><br />Will we and others like us someday grow to be tall hardwoods?&nbsp; Will we reshape the landscape of society as we know it?&nbsp; What if one day we had enough power to maintain a physical presence on the globe, where we shunned the parasites and upheld the rule of law, where the right to privacy and property was unquestioned and enshrined in the very structure of society.&nbsp; Where police are our servants and protectors beholden to their customers, the people.&nbsp; Where our leaders earn their power and responsibility in the harsh and unforgiving furnace of the free market and not from behind a gun, where the opportunities to create and enjoy wealth are as boundless as one&#039;s imagination.<br /><br />Some day, we could be a shining beacon of hope for the oppressed people of the world just as so many oppressed and violated souls have found refuge here already.&nbsp; Will it happen overnight?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Will it happen in a lifetime?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Is it worth fighting for until my last breath.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve seen what&#039;s possible, how can you do otherwise?&nbsp; How can you plug yourself into the tax eating, life sucking, violent, sadistic, war mongering, oppressive machine ever again?&nbsp; How can you kneel when you&#039;ve felt the power of your own legs?&nbsp; Felt them stretch and flex as you learn to walk and think as a free person?&nbsp; I would rather live my life in rags now than in golden chains.&nbsp; And now we can have both!&nbsp; Now it is profitable to throw off one&#039;s chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically.&nbsp; How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets?&nbsp; The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips!<br /><br />I have no one to share my thoughts with in physical space.&nbsp; Security does not permit it, so thanks for listening.&nbsp; I hope my words can be an inspiration just as I am given so much by everyone here.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Not everyone is continuously exposed to religious indoctrination, some countries more than others (obviously). I do think that Darwin&#039;s evolution theory is widely accepted though. In the middle east, for example religious indoctrination is a major role in many lives, other more &quot;advanced&quot; countries are much more exposed to Darwinism.

For some reason the mood struck me just now to put the revolution down for a minute and just express a few things.&nbsp; There is a curtain of anonymity and secrecy that covers everything that goes on behind the scenes here.&nbsp; It is often fast paced and stressful behind this curtain and I rarely lift my head long enough to take in just how amazing all of this is.&nbsp; But when I do I am filled with inspiration and hope for the future.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a little story about what inspires me:<br /><br />For years I was frustrated and defeated by what seemed to be insurmountable barriers between the world today and the world I wanted.&nbsp; I searched long and hard for the truth about what is right and wrong and good for humanity.&nbsp; I argued with, learned from, and read the works of brilliant people in search of the truth.&nbsp; It&#039;s a damn hard thing to do too with all of the misinformation and distractions in the sea of opinion we live in.&nbsp; But eventually I found something I could agree with whole heartedly.&nbsp; Something that made sense, was simple, elegant and consistent in all cases.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about the Austrian Economic theory, voluntaryism, anarcho-capitalism, agorism etc. espoused by the likes of Mises and Rothbard before their deaths, and Salerno and Rockwell today.<br /><br />From their works, I understood the mechanics of liberty, and the effects of tyranny.&nbsp; But such vision was a curse.&nbsp; Everywhere I looked I saw the State, and the horrible withering effects it had on the human spirit.&nbsp; It was horribly depressing.&nbsp; Like waking from a restless dream to find yourself in a cage with no way out.&nbsp; But I also saw free spirits trying to break free of their chains, doing everything they could to serve their fellow man and provide for themselves and their loved ones.&nbsp; I saw the magical and powerful wealth creating effect of the market, the way it fostered cooperation, civility and tolerance.&nbsp; How it made trading partners out of strangers or even enemies.&nbsp; How it coordinates the actions of every person on the planet in ways too complex for any one mind to fathom to produce an overflowing abundance of wealth, where nothing is wasted and where power and responsibility are directed to those most deserving and able.&nbsp; I saw a better way, but knew of no way to get there.<br /><br />I read everything I could to deepen my understanding of economics and liberty, but it was all intellectual, there was no call to action except to tell the people around me what I had learned and hopefully get them to see the light.&nbsp; That was until I read “Alongside night” and the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III.&nbsp; At last the missing puzzle piece!&nbsp; All of the sudden it was so clear:&nbsp; every action you take outside the scope of government control strengthens the market and weakens the state.&nbsp; I saw how the state lives parasitically off the productive people of the world, and how quickly it would crumble if it didn&#039;t have it&#039;s tax revenues.&nbsp; No soldiers if you can&#039;t pay them.&nbsp; No drug war without billions of dollars being siphoned off the very people you are oppressing.<br /><br />For the first time I saw the drug cartels and the dealers, and every person in the whole damn supply chain in a different light.&nbsp; Some, especially the cartels, are basically a defacto violent power hungry state, and surely would love nothing more than to take control of a national government, but you average joe pot dealer, who wouldn&#039;t hurt a fly, that guy became my hero.&nbsp; By making his living outside the purview of the state, he was depriving it of his precious life force, the product of his efforts. He was free.&nbsp; People like him, little by little, weakened the state and strengthened the market.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t long, maybe a year or two after this realization that the pieces started coming together for the Silk Road, and what a ride it has been.&nbsp; No longer do I feel ANY frustration.&nbsp; In fact I am at peace in the knowledge that every day I have more I can do to breath life into a truly revolutionary and free market than I have hours in the day.&nbsp; I walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive.<br /><br />We are like a little seed in a big jungle that has just broken the surface of the forest floor.&nbsp; It&#039;s a big scary jungle with lots of dangerous creatures, each honed by evolution to survive in the hostile environment known as human society.&nbsp; All manner of corporation, government agency, small family businesses, anything that can gain a foothold and survive.&nbsp; But the environment is rapidly changing and the jungle has never seen a species quite like the Silk Road.&nbsp; You can see it, but you can&#039;t touch it.&nbsp; It is elusive, yet powerful, and we are evolving at a rapid clip, experimenting, trying to find sturdy ground we can put roots down in.<br /><br />Will we and others like us someday grow to be tall hardwoods?&nbsp; Will we reshape the landscape of society as we know it?&nbsp; What if one day we had enough power to maintain a physical presence on the globe, where we shunned the parasites and upheld the rule of law, where the right to privacy and property was unquestioned and enshrined in the very structure of society.&nbsp; Where police are our servants and protectors beholden to their customers, the people.&nbsp; Where our leaders earn their power and responsibility in the harsh and unforgiving furnace of the free market and not from behind a gun, where the opportunities to create and enjoy wealth are as boundless as one&#039;s imagination.<br /><br />Some day, we could be a shining beacon of hope for the oppressed people of the world just as so many oppressed and violated souls have found refuge here already.&nbsp; Will it happen overnight?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Will it happen in a lifetime?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Is it worth fighting for until my last breath.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve seen what&#039;s possible, how can you do otherwise?&nbsp; How can you plug yourself into the tax eating, life sucking, violent, sadistic, war mongering, oppressive machine ever again?&nbsp; How can you kneel when you&#039;ve felt the power of your own legs?&nbsp; Felt them stretch and flex as you learn to walk and think as a free person?&nbsp; I would rather live my life in rags now than in golden chains.&nbsp; And now we can have both!&nbsp; Now it is profitable to throw off one&#039;s chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically.&nbsp; How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets?&nbsp; The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips!<br /><br />I have no one to share my thoughts with in physical space.&nbsp; Security does not permit it, so thanks for listening.&nbsp; I hope my words can be an inspiration just as I am given so much by everyone here.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

For some reason the mood struck me just now to put the revolution down for a minute and just express a few things.&nbsp; There is a curtain of anonymity and secrecy that covers everything that goes on behind the scenes here.&nbsp; It is often fast paced and stressful behind this curtain and I rarely lift my head long enough to take in just how amazing all of this is.&nbsp; But when I do I am filled with inspiration and hope for the future.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a little story about what inspires me:<br /><br />For years I was frustrated and defeated by what seemed to be insurmountable barriers between the world today and the world I wanted.&nbsp; I searched long and hard for the truth about what is right and wrong and good for humanity.&nbsp; I argued with, learned from, and read the works of brilliant people in search of the truth.&nbsp; It&#039;s a damn hard thing to do too with all of the misinformation and distractions in the sea of opinion we live in.&nbsp; But eventually I found something I could agree with whole heartedly.&nbsp; Something that made sense, was simple, elegant and consistent in all cases.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about the Austrian Economic theory, voluntaryism, anarcho-capitalism, agorism etc. espoused by the likes of Mises and Rothbard before their deaths, and Salerno and Rockwell today.<br /><br />From their works, I understood the mechanics of liberty, and the effects of tyranny.&nbsp; But such vision was a curse.&nbsp; Everywhere I looked I saw the State, and the horrible withering effects it had on the human spirit.&nbsp; It was horribly depressing.&nbsp; Like waking from a restless dream to find yourself in a cage with no way out.&nbsp; But I also saw free spirits trying to break free of their chains, doing everything they could to serve their fellow man and provide for themselves and their loved ones.&nbsp; I saw the magical and powerful wealth creating effect of the market, the way it fostered cooperation, civility and tolerance.&nbsp; How it made trading partners out of strangers or even enemies.&nbsp; How it coordinates the actions of every person on the planet in ways too complex for any one mind to fathom to produce an overflowing abundance of wealth, where nothing is wasted and where power and responsibility are directed to those most deserving and able.&nbsp; I saw a better way, but knew of no way to get there.<br /><br />I read everything I could to deepen my understanding of economics and liberty, but it was all intellectual, there was no call to action except to tell the people around me what I had learned and hopefully get them to see the light.&nbsp; That was until I read “Alongside night” and the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III.&nbsp; At last the missing puzzle piece!&nbsp; All of the sudden it was so clear:&nbsp; every action you take outside the scope of government control strengthens the market and weakens the state.&nbsp; I saw how the state lives parasitically off the productive people of the world, and how quickly it would crumble if it didn&#039;t have it&#039;s tax revenues.&nbsp; No soldiers if you can&#039;t pay them.&nbsp; No drug war without billions of dollars being siphoned off the very people you are oppressing.<br /><br />For the first time I saw the drug cartels and the dealers, and every person in the whole damn supply chain in a different light.&nbsp; Some, especially the cartels, are basically a defacto violent power hungry state, and surely would love nothing more than to take control of a national government, but you average joe pot dealer, who wouldn&#039;t hurt a fly, that guy became my hero.&nbsp; By making his living outside the purview of the state, he was depriving it of his precious life force, the product of his efforts. He was free.&nbsp; People like him, little by little, weakened the state and strengthened the market.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t long, maybe a year or two after this realization that the pieces started coming together for the Silk Road, and what a ride it has been.&nbsp; No longer do I feel ANY frustration.&nbsp; In fact I am at peace in the knowledge that every day I have more I can do to breath life into a truly revolutionary and free market than I have hours in the day.&nbsp; I walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive.<br /><br />We are like a little seed in a big jungle that has just broken the surface of the forest floor.&nbsp; It&#039;s a big scary jungle with lots of dangerous creatures, each honed by evolution to survive in the hostile environment known as human society.&nbsp; All manner of corporation, government agency, small family businesses, anything that can gain a foothold and survive.&nbsp; But the environment is rapidly changing and the jungle has never seen a species quite like the Silk Road.&nbsp; You can see it, but you can&#039;t touch it.&nbsp; It is elusive, yet powerful, and we are evolving at a rapid clip, experimenting, trying to find sturdy ground we can put roots down in.<br /><br />Will we and others like us someday grow to be tall hardwoods?&nbsp; Will we reshape the landscape of society as we know it?&nbsp; What if one day we had enough power to maintain a physical presence on the globe, where we shunned the parasites and upheld the rule of law, where the right to privacy and property was unquestioned and enshrined in the very structure of society.&nbsp; Where police are our servants and protectors beholden to their customers, the people.&nbsp; Where our leaders earn their power and responsibility in the harsh and unforgiving furnace of the free market and not from behind a gun, where the opportunities to create and enjoy wealth are as boundless as one&#039;s imagination.<br /><br />Some day, we could be a shining beacon of hope for the oppressed people of the world just as so many oppressed and violated souls have found refuge here already.&nbsp; Will it happen overnight?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Will it happen in a lifetime?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Is it worth fighting for until my last breath.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve seen what&#039;s possible, how can you do otherwise?&nbsp; How can you plug yourself into the tax eating, life sucking, violent, sadistic, war mongering, oppressive machine ever again?&nbsp; How can you kneel when you&#039;ve felt the power of your own legs?&nbsp; Felt them stretch and flex as you learn to walk and think as a free person?&nbsp; I would rather live my life in rags now than in golden chains.&nbsp; And now we can have both!&nbsp; Now it is profitable to throw off one&#039;s chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically.&nbsp; How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets?&nbsp; The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips!<br /><br />I have no one to share my thoughts with in physical space.&nbsp; Security does not permit it, so thanks for listening.&nbsp; I hope my words can be an inspiration just as I am given so much by everyone here.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				The importance if SR isn&#039;t in the drugs, it&#039;s in the freedom to operate outside of government&nbsp; constraints. This is the first truly FREE market in the modern world. For that, more than anything else, the SR is an important evolution in modern technology.

				Thanks for bumping this thread, Fantasticfox. <br /><br />I might never have got to read DPR&#039;s heartfelt and inspirational speech otherwise :)<br /><br />Thank you also, DPR. So much of what you wrote reflects my own philosophy. You sound like somebody who has read the brilliant works of Ayn Rand (Apart from the scammers, SR is Galt&#039;s Gulch in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;). Your charter reflects the core values of Laissez-faire capitalism, and the sanctity of personal sovereignty.<br /><br />As a relative n00b to SR, I feel I have found somewhere that reflects my own dearly-held core values. This is a crazy, upside-down anticivilization we are living in. I see it every time I turn on the TV or step outside my front door. I&#039;ve always considered drug dealing to be one of the few remaining healthy trades. There is a lot of positive karma in not paying taxes while providing people with the means to modulate their own consciousness. Tax supports the infrastructure of oppression, and how many businesses refuse to pay tax? <br /><br />The bastions of modern capitalism, banks and big corporations, don&#039;t appear to know the first thing about capitalism. They use force, favors, and political muscle to gain the upper hand over their competitors. The pharmaceutical cartels peddle ritalin to kids. The media spew prefabricated chunks of &quot;truth&quot; at their unsuspecting viewers. Everyone&#039;s out for a quick buck, ripping each other off while pointing the finger at the evil drug dealers, prostitutes, and privacy advocates. If that isn&#039;t an anticivilization, I don&#039;t know what is.<br /><br />The Silk Road is a shining example of what is possible in a free world. Whether it will prevail far into the future is anyone&#039;s guess. I hope it does, but whether it does or not you can bet your life it&#039;s going into the history books!<br /><br />Bless you, DPR, and everyone who supports the SR vision..... we are all making history :)<br /><br />

				True words of wisdom.<br /><br />This much more than just buying and selling substances. This is a fight for the freedom from the parasites and vampires that have held us in bondage for centuries !<br /><br />These vultures know that their vision of a tyrannical world government cannot be achieved overnight, or even in their lifetimes. We have to realize the same as you&#039;ve pointed out DPR - this is going to last for decades and most of us will not be here to see the fruits of it. But we must fight and struggle and ENDURE. <br /><br />The Babylon system is going down - humanity will be free again. Perhaps not in our lifetimes but maybe our greatgrand children will live in a free society one day. This fight is beyond our petty little selves, and egos it is a fight to release Man from the bondage - both spiritual and emotional. <br /><br />Peace,

				Haven&#039;t got time to read all 10 pages of replies right now, but re: OP - simply awesome. You are my hero DPR. All I can think of to do right now is find a way to &#039;turn on, tune in, drop out&#039; and join the good fight by living outside of state control as much as possible (well, 2/3 of the way there&nbsp; ;) ). Keep up the good work and we&#039;ll keep on supporting you. As you say; you have to keep stuff bottled up in meat-space for security, but we&#039;re all here for you... should you need us...

Anonymity is a highly entropic lifestyle, but it yields vast harvests of intelligence and creativity. The game of thrones is a persistent and ceaseless acquisition of power and security. SR is a kingdom in a land that that is under attack from bigots and businessmen, politicians and Capture Troopers--the Senate and their armies, as in Rome.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=16070.msg157812#msg157812">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts (aka Mortal God of Liberty) on March 20, 2012, 11:39 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For years I was frustrated and defeated by what seemed to be insurmountable barriers between the world today and the world I wanted.&nbsp; I searched long and hard for the truth about what is right and wrong and good for humanity.&nbsp; I argued with, learned from, and read the works of brilliant people in search of the truth.&nbsp; It&#039;s a damn hard thing to do too with all of the misinformation and distractions in the sea of opinion we live in.&nbsp; But eventually I found something I could agree with whole heartedly.&nbsp; Something that made sense, was simple, elegant and consistent in all cases.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about the Austrian Economic theory, voluntaryism, anarcho-capitalism, agorism etc. espoused by the likes of Mises and Rothbard before their deaths, and Salerno and Rockwell today.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is an example of how being a good follower, indeed, creates venerable leaders. Truth comes into our lives in many ways, whether through a new born son or a newly routed server.

One answer to pain is childish curiosity and wonder, patience, and ambition.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=16070.msg157812#msg157812">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts (aka Mortal God of Liberty) on March 20, 2012, 11:39 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From their works, I understood the mechanics of liberty, and the effects of tyranny.&nbsp; But such vision was a curse.&nbsp; Everywhere I looked I saw the State, and the horrible withering effects it had on the human spirit.&nbsp; It was horribly depressing.&nbsp; Like waking from a restless dream to find yourself in a cage with no way out.&nbsp; But I also saw free spirits trying to break free of their chains, doing everything they could to serve their fellow man and provide for themselves and their loved ones.&nbsp; I saw the magical and powerful wealth creating effect of the market, the way it fostered cooperation, civility and tolerance.&nbsp; How it made trading partners out of strangers or even enemies.&nbsp; How it coordinates the actions of every person on the planet in ways too complex for any one mind to fathom to produce an overflowing abundance of wealth, where nothing is wasted and where power and responsibility are directed to those most deserving and able.&nbsp; I saw a better way, but knew of no way to get there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Meritocracy and a free state.<br /><br />There is a startling historical observation in your words, DPR. The natural philosophers--the Western world&#039;s modern social scientists--have mostly been wealthy men, out of which hardly comes freedom and liberty. American founders--terrorists in the eyes of the British at the time, and still to this day--were slave owners. This is not to say that their words are hollow and useless, but that there has been a historical oddity where the rich are those that stake claims to political philosophy and applications.<br /><br />An anonymous marketplace threatens conventional society: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and all the rest that commit to the Good Ol&#039; Boy system of who you are and where you came from; e.g. George W. Bush, living under the shadows of his father and the Bush Dynasty of Intelligence and Power. Bank of America, Coca Cola, HBSC, the Cartel, American bipartisan corruption, Monsanto, DOW, McDonald&#039;s, AT&amp;T, Comcast, etc.<br /><br />How many products suggest or require product registration? Most cell phones are subject to infrastructure contracts and limited consumer control--you do not own the proprietary OS of your own phone? ? ? ?
