				Exactly as the title says, i placed an order about 2 days ago with deathb4dishonor for #4 sample size, in his user page it says to leave FE early, how do i do this? Also, if anyone has experience with this vendor, how long does it take to go from Processing to In Transit?

				you cant finalize until db4d changes it from processing to in transit<br /><br />imo you shouldnt finalize early for db4d. he was directed by SR support to stop taking orders until those from weeks ago that have not arrived yet are finally delivered. <br /><br />there is a chance he is scamming or at a minimum just cant handle the orders <br /><br />go to the rumor mill and read about his feedback. you need to decide i you want to give up the protection of escrow for a vendor who sends bunk coke and then claims he accidentally sent heroin instead of C - which could KILL someone

				well the BTC is in escrow now, or thats what it shows in my account, so if he never ships what happens? do i get my BTC back?<br /><br />i did a little searching on the forums, i had the feel that he was a legitimate vendor but i could have read the wrong posts.

				if he doesnt mark it in transit within 4 days you will have the option to cancel<br /><br />if you leave the funds in escrow even after he marks in transit as the system is intended then you are protected. if your order doesnt arrive after a week or two you enter resolution where db4d will &quot;reship&quot; or more like ship the first time or SR will refund your money minus commission<br /><br />during a refund you will either receive the dollar amount if hedged or if unhedged you will receive the btc amount<br /><br />if you FE then you have no protection and risk losing the money completely if he doesnt follow through. ive just seen way too many issues to think FE is a good idea including an unusual amount of orders arriving, shipping taking weeks, sending the wrong thing, and people complaining about the quality

				I just can&#039;t scream it loud enough: DON&#039;T FE!!! Don&#039;t do it, don&#039;t do it, don&#039;t do it. Db4d will get your coin and SR can&#039;t help you. You can only hope that you&#039;ll get what you ordered. If you don&#039;t, you&#039;ve just been scammed and lost all your coin. <br /><br />Find another vendor....there&#039;s tons of fabulous, honest, hard working vendors here.

				yea, i dont think i&#039;m going to FE, if it goes to in transit then ill just hope it will arrive.<br /><br />I just placed an order for some xanax with vendor, Natasha, no FE needed for her, so hopefully i receive product.<br /><br />Anyone recommend vendors for small amounts of heroin to the US, is the vendor purest any good?

				Appreciating this thread.&nbsp; It answered some of my noob questions, too.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got another: vendors have a &quot;become a fan&quot; option that says a link to them will be established on your homepage if you click.&nbsp; Where is a non-vendor&#039;s homepage?&nbsp; Where&#039;s my SR homepage with these fan links on it?&nbsp; Haven&#039;t found it anyplace I&#039;ve looked so far.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for the help.
