				Are you sure this is the right address? Going to the old address (ianxz6zefk72ulzz) gives us the exact same message, but with a different address (silkroadvb5piz3r.onion, which seems to work) and silkroad98uejm4n.onion doesn&#039;t work at all.<br />The PGP signature seems to be the same too, but as I don&#039;t have the SR keys (yet, I&#039;m going to look for them in a minute) I can&#039;t verify either message.

				I&#039;m not saying the newbies are lieing, but I&#039;ll be taking the mildly paranoid route and not doing shit til I hear from Silk Road or senior members. <br /><br />Just because you can login doesn&#039;t mean someone didn&#039;t phish your password. They could intercept it, record it, and forward it to the site so that you go along without knowing... meanwhile they&#039;re seeing if you&#039;re using the same password anywhere else...

				the signature on the post in the forum is the same signature as the post on the original ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/ site, but the message is different. that is why the post on the site doesn&#039;t verify and the one in the forum does. but a phisher couldn&#039;t have created a redirect page with the same .onion address as the actual store without a few decades of brute forcing the private key to get that address. And they can&#039;t spoof the address unless they controlled a majority of TOR nodes (which they don&#039;t). the link on the redirect page is legit, and if you want to try it with a log in that isn&#039;t yours, PM me and I&#039;ll give you one to try.

				Dear SR Admin,<br />I am very happy with the speed of the site now. Sorry to be a pain in the ass I know it could possibly be beyond your control at times but please keep it that way. I have been sad for 4 days because I had such a hard time connecting to SR. Wow I think I&#039;m becoming addicted. Customers are wonderful, other sellers are wonderful. Never a problem here! This place took away so much stress from my life - with that said you&#039;ll notice I&#039;ve only been a member for 30 days and only have ten transactions but it&#039;s all going so smooth.

I can think of 4 reasons right now why an abrupt migration makes sense. An easier to remember URL is not one of them. That URL seems still easy to spoof. Can anyone tell me which one of these is correct without looking at the new url? :<br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br />silkroadvc5piz3r.onion<br /><br />Yeah, I can&#039;t either.<br /><br />I can think of 40 reasons why an abrupt migration is concerning, a point of contention. Will the other forum admins please (dig alch, et al.) confirm the abrupt migration and affirm everything is on point. Please.<br /><br />The best way for a 3rd party to take control of SR would be to export the dB and code migrate and redeploy at a new URL pointing at a content delivery network designed to track and identify, and thenre-assure everyone everything was cool here. <br /><br />&quot;Hey, what could possibly be wrong? all the same data is right there.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks in advance for holding my hand and the other forum admins here chiming in and affirming the migration.

				Yes, I was joking at the surprise of 1btc = $3... though I&#039;m still keeping my skeptical nature about the site. I&#039;ve created a new account on it for &quot;poking around&quot; purposes.<br /><br />Paper, I think you need to verify your key checking process. All signed posts by the &quot;Silk Road&quot; admin account in this thread check out as being valid for me... and we have the same keys as verified earlier. You should try checking some of the earlier &quot;Silk Road&quot; posts and verify that your key-checking does indeed work. Maybe my checking is flawed and you&#039;re the one true checker... but if that&#039;s the case, you should be able to verify that against older, non-edited SR posts.<br /><br />About your &quot;orange&quot; levels, when I checked it earlier, SR had one of your orange listings left... easily something that could have been a canceled order (just guessing from my pov). <br /><br />I still wish that the redirect from the original site URL had a signed message that validated, but that worries me far less than any of the previous discrepancies.

The inventory is not the same as it was 120m ago. I am completely sure of that. 100%.

				Everyone who&#039;s getting &quot;invalid&quot; results when checking the signed messages here needs to try validating some known to be correct messages. Google other sites and do some practice runs to make sure you&#039;re checking the right things and getting results that match the known results. This is kinda like hard drive backup... if you haven&#039;t done a practice run or two when its not an emergency, you don&#039;t really know if you&#039;re doing it right when it is an emergency.<br /><br />Also, the redirect has changed and it now validates for me as well.

				It was a situation a little bit like this.&nbsp; When I first signed up I just cruised around and checked things out and then one day I was going to make a purchase and SR was down and someone posted a new URL for SR in the forum.&nbsp; I placed my order around midnight.&nbsp; Came back the next day and my order had been cancelled and my bitcoins were returned to my account and my account on SR was empty.&nbsp; <br />Thus, why I&#039;m a bit freaked about a new URL.&nbsp;

				I think we could all use a nice fluffy kitten and some deep breaths&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I think it is good advice to open another account if skeptical still. I trust paperchasing and am grateful for two people for verifying the signature. <br />Also thanks SR for being so responsive and helping calm everyone&#039;s frenzy quickly. <br /><br />The comment about the hive mentality was a very interesting concept and I had never really imagined it that way. Very awesome to be involved in such a complex behavior occurring between so many anonymous thought processes of varying experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry to hear about your unfortunate experience tcob, hope you those fuckers didnt get very much from you. Understandable for you to be concerned, and probably best to just sit tight for a day while some others test it out probably to be really safe...

				Well this was a lot of fun. When I saw it, I immediately checked the message on the frontpage...which didn&#039;t verify. Jumped into SILC, it was going 100 miles a minute in there. :P <br /><br />Considering that the message is now signed by SR&#039;s PGP key, and also independently confirmed by Paperchasing, I do trust that the URL change was authentic...it was just really bad thinking on SR&#039;s part not to give us a heads up.

				It&#039;s definetly SR, you would all be wise however considering if this had been a compromise and you use one password&nbsp; with multiple sites you strongly reconsider this practice, there are applications like password safe to keep track of them and have them all randomly generated for you. There are a lot of people who use the same password in multiple places and and if this had been an attack that opens you to losing more than one account i.e. your mtgox password is the same as your SR, or SR the same as tormail.net etc etc...

				it would have been nice for silk to post that a change was coming, then make the change, instead of making a change, then posting an incorrectly signed message, and causing this nightmare. pgp signing messages is very BASIC security. informing your THOUSANDS of customers that a change is coming is BASIC customer service. get your head out of your ass Silk and get your shit together.

				I logged in with an old test account and didn&#039;t see a lot of listings, including anything from Paperchasing. Someone posted to check which country your account is set to, and I changed it to the US and now everything is back. Initially the site seemed faster then I couldn&#039;t connect for 10 minutes repeatedly trying with new identities. Now it&#039;s back. <br /><br />As everyone agrees, this change was handled in a really bad way. You couldn&#039;t have fucked it up more.

				This is going to get a little bit technical. I&#039;m a noob on the forum (and just executed my first successful purchase recently), but I do have significant expertise in the areas I&#039;m going to discuss.<br /><br />Obviously I&#039;m not going to prove that statement, because I like keeping my anonymity, but other experts should be able to tell from what I say.<br /><br />tl;dr, here are four points of advice I STRONGLY suggest the community adopts:<br /><br />1. Sign each others&#039; keys once you have some proof that it belongs to the person it&#039;s claimed by, and do so at the appropriate level of validation. This helps build a &quot;Web of Trust&quot;, where while I may not know for sure that e.g. Holland is really PGP 4654CBBA, I *do* know reasonably that LexieSadie is PGP A7C82017. So if LexieSadie can prove to themselves that Holland&#039;s key is legit, there&#039;s a chain - I trust LexieSadie a little bit, she trusts Holland, therefore I can trust Holland.<br /><br />This goes for sellers, buyers, and Silk Road admin. SIGN EACH OTHERS&#039; KEYS — but ONLY when you have proof that they belong to the entity claimed. (E.g. proof for Silk Road admin could be that the key was the one used at the launch of site, has been consistently used in communication w/ sellers, etc.)<br /><br />2. SELLERS: Include a small message printout in your envelopes, signed with the PGP key you posted on your seller account. It doesn&#039;t need to say anything substantive, but it MUST include the current date (e.g. &quot;Thanks! Shipped 1 Dec 2011&quot;).<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t give anything of value away if it&#039;s compromised by the feds (having a signature only tells them what ID it was signed with, not the full info of the key). But it DOES definitively prove to your recipient that the person who packed the envelope is the person who owns that key. <br /><br />If they get a slip with an implausibly old ship date, that&#039;s a red flag for compromise.<br /><br />3. SR Admin: There must be a PGP signed statement of the current legit URL, along with your PGP key with all current signatures, on SR&#039;s front page AT ALL TIMES, as well as on ALL former URLs. The key ID itself MUST NOT CHANGE, but more signatures = more trustworthy, if it&#039;s signed by someone that a user themselves has validated.<br /><br />Merely putting a message on there saying &quot;be sure you have the right URL&quot;, without any way to *prove* it&#039;s the right URL, is useless.<br /><br />4. NEVER EVER EVER EVER set a key&#039;s trust to &#039;ultimate&#039; unless it&#039;s YOURS. Set it to &#039;marginal&#039; if you have some evidence that they&#039;re who they say they are AND are trustworthy themselves; set it to &#039;full&#039; if you know for sure they&#039;re who they are and that you would trust keys that they sign. PGP has two separate things for this:<br /><br />TRUST (unknown, never, marginal, full, ultimate) dictates whether you trust OTHER keys that this key has signed. Hopefully you only do this if you&#039;ve personally validated it. (Remember that PGP trust propagates, so if you trust A and A trusts B [whom you&#039;ve never heard of], it&#039;ll figure out how much you should trust B)<br />SIGNATURES (0/uncategorized, 1/casual, 2/personal, 3/high) tell to others how much YOU have validated that the key belongs to who it says it belongs to. - see http://aperiodic.net/phil/pgp/policy.html

				Now for the details...<br /><br />Have you ever MET &quot;Silk Road&quot;? No. All you know is that you have *a* public key whose name part says &quot;Silk Road&quot;, which was used to sign the OP of this thread.

A key is just a key. You have to have some other means of proving whom it belongs to. (Note that I didn&#039;t bother faking the creation date on that key, or any of a number of other things that I could have done to very closely mimic key ID # 67B7FA25, but I&#039;m lazy. Trust me, I could do it. The only thing I can&#039;t do is make a new key with the exact same ID and fingerprint, or replicate others&#039; signatures.)<br /><br /><br />I would suggest a few potential remedies:<br /><br />1. Sellers: if you have had previous (long-term) GPG exchange with &quot;the real Silk Road&quot;, such that you&#039;re 100% convinced the owner of that key is the admin of ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion, validate that key and SIGN IT with the key you use for customers.<br /><br />Likewise, Silk Road, sign the keys of registered sellers you know are legit.<br /><br />This way, noobs like me who only know a couple sellers&#039; GPG keys, and know them as legit because we actually got our shit IRL, but weren&#039;t around in the early days to get SR&#039;s pubkey from a legit source (sorry, this isn&#039;t a legit source), can then in turn trust that key.<br /><br />Since we don&#039;t want to expose these keys to public key servers, the exchange has to happen manually.<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s an example.<br /><br />This is LexieSadie&#039;s PGP key as published on her last listings:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)<br /><br />mQENBE5u9HcBCADU/e5i+tdp8iohkmb9WSc41A2tR5sE4RwO7gMi3J0oEulzyojB<br />4ClJV9/N/ob8j/DhNw77b1iSIl2QrRvrgS2MrTPBB58ocFfp1tezgFaJ1FLLRAYY<br />C3Xra4h/XNLYdQD4wbprUPxZNjS323Rw4os3ZNc4EI+CFDAYnbZcKOGh2CISzIq2<br />IsWZf7Bdwf7dPGYDrVsGu5hjm6EoLzCtMBj/0/OWOb9XzoKq9JJXOCK/VG0Z/fwF<br />UB8SqRc9avGm7RdKMqM+T9iqyIhxCmtBcbGirpYtfjr8hpMMauJllheqHlHjSWr8<br />5wxdZIZQYi/SP5XVl68G2tRnctM9aeVdiEn1ABEBAAG0GUxleGlTYWRpZSA8ZmFr<br />ZUBmYWtlLmNvbT6JATgEEwECACIFAk5u9HcCGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMB<br />Ah4BAheAAAoJEOftwSKnyCAXEukH/Rwe4ESfRI7awzOkrgIMNVJoueOprhzuek8I<br />7YxaXPm4ChkVE/wY7yoqUFk6fkZehPyUAcILQmwfSpdwiApSgkUfH9FahdOHoK0U<br />aSM2xsUuiifAJJN0nin/ftOjZdtugRmfks/hSa+QUbwsGDVPFJRXMRQUyVTeYxam<br />YCAHg8gNuHUnCEAfgine4ZiO0un5aAOkxExmQKe5uLzAQazC7WH5/odKmr+d7IM9<br />wSEKnFZQmgLcl9URfhlkWWFFLNOV55aOwlwtl8JDrkQjujn6rHH5+Zisu70Wg6hH<br />8zsNt9pPYZXpYP2/ZSEPLwV4chI0rfavnidQEIr9u//1Tn/8NgK5AQ0ETm70dwEI<br />AN2AGonXB+y4lmedPaTNoYHtDTTgJfl9zVaYrUH5+fWMoOcKiV4tbgK9RYgKClQX<br />ioLN9gIEhpmSPR9LIgELfIWbPO9sM1tvvcEMOtGBjv4Ndlh3m7c1RX6nbiYLjGss<br />1AR7l0kp40X0rrgplTOQ8q3AhsYd2LBigueiWiYhdFjrjdc0K7r0hUJvcEAWom3L<br />TgxJna7Uq0KnxoSTQEH8jmsyqlccKaNIfJjbNgJicbDg8uA8qlS8xTql7yjlA777<br />YPzH/GeqQ9wl+nY65pinq2TqK4ZEynS9bPMSXlOSw5JGZQws+pd4PsYEk6ix/ONM<br />j5AYpWlq/Q/+CR+pJaXPGycAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQIACQUCTm70dwIbDAAKCRDn7cEi<br />p8ggF2CLCACS0JE12FWRVfRXq4ii1SRdea5nBeUJZrWK55F5/pFEBPUoWczZa/ra<br />YfT7vQXimnO7YG2C1QxzwB5wB2kur7teMvQo/D2gzRf3G/bByAqMU2ClKrEYBAj+<br />WF6sWtULbRzb7sECKWs1UWgX019PtE/bdzsABWAnxEC1wX+czMAAl3JrI3Rd/hTh<br />1+mVVn18gDnt2mcOMBpHHTKZE2gXy0vzIo8iPpwlrIh05CvMgSCoE33MdbG33RU8<br />+c7zOw3lrdTJ8So/2O36+0vSypbCzuJVAa2DpDkrRoiok8QQx8963durh51ibtT4<br />ABbV3I/AtoBqLi+89AkoeI0XtMM09cY1<br />=nQB4<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br />Now, I&#039;ve had a successful transaction with LexieSadie, encrypted to that, so I have *weak* confirmation that the above key represents the actual human who handled my weed so brilliantly.<br /><br />Why &quot;weak&quot;? Simple: someone else could run a phishing site, replace all PGP keys with fake ones (like I faked SR above), and then just run a silent MITM attack where they pass any messages back and forth.<br /><br />But hey, it&#039;s something. Since &quot;LexieSadie&quot; isn&#039;t a human per se, it&#039;s a pseudonym that a human (or group) uses to do business, there&#039;s only so much you can do to validate that.<br /><br />So, I went into GPG Keychain Access, and signed her key with that of the buyer account I used with LexieSadie. I set the verification level to &#039;casual&#039;, given the above.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the revised key:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)<br /><br />mQENBE5u9HcBCADU/e5i+tdp8iohkmb9WSc41A2tR5sE4RwO7gMi3J0oEulzyojB<br />4ClJV9/N/ob8j/DhNw77b1iSIl2QrRvrgS2MrTPBB58ocFfp1tezgFaJ1FLLRAYY<br />C3Xra4h/XNLYdQD4wbprUPxZNjS323Rw4os3ZNc4EI+CFDAYnbZcKOGh2CISzIq2<br />IsWZf7Bdwf7dPGYDrVsGu5hjm6EoLzCtMBj/0/OWOb9XzoKq9JJXOCK/VG0Z/fwF<br />UB8SqRc9avGm7RdKMqM+T9iqyIhxCmtBcbGirpYtfjr8hpMMauJllheqHlHjSWr8<br />5wxdZIZQYi/SP5XVl68G2tRnctM9aeVdiEn1ABEBAAG0GUxleGlTYWRpZSA8ZmFr<br />ZUBmYWtlLmNvbT6JATgEEwECACIFAk5u9HcCGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMB<br />Ah4BAheAAAoJEOftwSKnyCAXEukH/Rwe4ESfRI7awzOkrgIMNVJoueOprhzuek8I<br />7YxaXPm4ChkVE/wY7yoqUFk6fkZehPyUAcILQmwfSpdwiApSgkUfH9FahdOHoK0U<br />aSM2xsUuiifAJJN0nin/ftOjZdtugRmfks/hSa+QUbwsGDVPFJRXMRQUyVTeYxam<br />YCAHg8gNuHUnCEAfgine4ZiO0un5aAOkxExmQKe5uLzAQazC7WH5/odKmr+d7IM9<br />wSEKnFZQmgLcl9URfhlkWWFFLNOV55aOwlwtl8JDrkQjujn6rHH5+Zisu70Wg6hH<br />8zsNt9pPYZXpYP2/ZSEPLwV4chI0rfavnidQEIr9u//1Tn/8NgKJAhwEEgECAAYF<br />Ak7XhWAACgkQBXxJQf+3Q3dvmw//d5dGDojxkgG+RARncr02BNUBNKs+JiOg1syq<br />tXSBnpPuNVvGtJVfX9A1PErpHLUTL58mPDXW27gqvZ4/QW2g+quNqlD/jwYdocoo<br />Eyk7FqIqyf32kSaSCKnUrSbnFzYQrYsZL9gZyBdkcOULroFkN7b2Mv+MXm2/I7yi<br />uBsw8Usf7Z2H0WropX5fY/BCrPAGZU0R+m/kJJFxkG2DKfXoE5xRPBzV9Tzm/xgz<br />avvD7RJ6PPpBKgy1G9nQa6Brhs0KGb+r1unXexz5Fo85srlJX9A0eCqqiIFfiwtK<br />P8GBjFqjovqb3E6y7fLtyfMlP3dwQ+GT2GZ6lHMeKX32Xt0XmGO7z/JCjQI325wt<br />EpN9naSmJw4JbTrtM6t8oaru0/bIOhH5tgm26VZIGulefT4KSayumtDfVUu2Ffri<br />+31CpLfAZ46yL0rINn2K9NonosBrGqiPzxy/BuiwOrGYsU77hsw8ju2T/cHoFXnX<br />uKqhSXst894l4b3q6ydEXnJXWl7vqMkiQvRDdh/Dq2o/0QIQNoOACAp8WEwo1axo<br />OYRBFEDybW9LjQSXHc/j2GrjWSeVcrA2TDmsJ5JR1ZAd4i11iLB53bqGL864zeii<br />QitLK1H6TSsgcyBTTPP0QHRhM7FFg8tn5PkFJJv9D3bhH88OiX2qXAGb4WsaMflK<br />iDNZ0L+5AQ0ETm70dwEIAN2AGonXB+y4lmedPaTNoYHtDTTgJfl9zVaYrUH5+fWM<br />oOcKiV4tbgK9RYgKClQXioLN9gIEhpmSPR9LIgELfIWbPO9sM1tvvcEMOtGBjv4N<br />dlh3m7c1RX6nbiYLjGss1AR7l0kp40X0rrgplTOQ8q3AhsYd2LBigueiWiYhdFjr<br />jdc0K7r0hUJvcEAWom3LTgxJna7Uq0KnxoSTQEH8jmsyqlccKaNIfJjbNgJicbDg<br />8uA8qlS8xTql7yjlA777YPzH/GeqQ9wl+nY65pinq2TqK4ZEynS9bPMSXlOSw5JG<br />ZQws+pd4PsYEk6ix/ONMj5AYpWlq/Q/+CR+pJaXPGycAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQIACQUC<br />Tm70dwIbDAAKCRDn7cEip8ggF2CLCACS0JE12FWRVfRXq4ii1SRdea5nBeUJZrWK<br />55F5/pFEBPUoWczZa/raYfT7vQXimnO7YG2C1QxzwB5wB2kur7teMvQo/D2gzRf3<br />G/bByAqMU2ClKrEYBAj+WF6sWtULbRzb7sECKWs1UWgX019PtE/bdzsABWAnxEC1<br />wX+czMAAl3JrI3Rd/hTh1+mVVn18gDnt2mcOMBpHHTKZE2gXy0vzIo8iPpwlrIh0<br />5CvMgSCoE33MdbG33RU8+c7zOw3lrdTJ8So/2O36+0vSypbCzuJVAa2DpDkrRoio<br />k8QQx8963durh51ibtT4ABbV3I/AtoBqLi+89AkoeI0XtMM09cY1<br />=ex2Z<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />Try importing it. You&#039;ll see that it is indeed the same key as the previous one, it just has a new signature for the primary UserID.<br /><br />LexieSadie could also sign *my* public key as someone she has successfully completed as a transaction with. I could then use that revised public key in new communications with sellers, who&#039;d see definitive proof that the person they know as LexieSadie has some trust in me, and use that as part of their decisionmaking for whether to trust me as a buyer.<br /><br />I should underscore here that you should NOT &quot;early sign&quot; a key. You should only do it when you have some level of proof that the person is who they say they are.<br /><br /><br />2. So, what&#039;s the maximum amount of proof that a given PGP key is &quot;real&quot;? This is a question of what the likely attack scenarios are. Let&#039;s go through them.<br /><br /><br />SR Admin:<br /><br />a) Site has an SQL injection exploit or similar vulnerability that allowed an attacker to completely dump its database, allowing them to put up a new hidden service (say, silkroadvb5piz3r.onion) with all that info intact. <br /><br />Limitation: they would not have access to SR&#039;s private PGP keys, unless they&#039;re a total idiot and storing them on the server rather than somewhere independent and safe.<br /><br />b) Site has a MITM attack, aka the usual phishing method. Attacker puts up a new hidden service (say, silkroadtherealthign.onion). Since they don&#039;t have the DB, what they do is just proxy all requests to the real site. This adds a delay, but since we&#039;re dealing with Tor, delays are not suspicious. The phisher&#039;s site could then steal all transparent info (eg passwords) and all database info (by scraping what users see). <br /><br />Limitations: same as above, plus the added delay.<br /><br />c) SR has been compromised IRL by the police, who have forced them to hand over their PGP private keys and passwords, database, hidden service ID/secret keys, etc, in return for more lenient sentencing and the ability to get lots of info about drug smugglers (aka all you lovely sellers). They continue operating the site exactly as usual. They can sign with SR&#039;s PGP key and do everything else they did.<br /><br />Limitations: unless they have SR&#039;s active cooperation, they might make mistakes replicating their writing style. Also, if there were any out-of-band secrets passed that they *didn&#039;t* manage to capture (ie they weren&#039;t on whatever machines they compromised, and SR the human didn&#039;t blab about them), then they wouldn&#039;t know those secrets.<br /><br /><br />Ways to prove the PGP is legit against a &amp; b: post a signed message on the front page of every legit SR URL ever (current and previous), saying &quot;The correct SR URL is blahblahblah.onion&quot;. Also list SR&#039;s public key with all current signatures. The key will change regularly as new signatures are added, but its ID, fingerprint, etc core properties will not change.<br /><br />Ways to protect against c: If compromise is suspected, someone who has an out-of-band secret (eg communicated via some other Tor service the feds didn&#039;t know about and/or weren&#039;t able to get records of) can challenge the SR admin to decrypt a PGP message signed with that as a symmetric key.<br /><br />For example, suppose SR and I had chatted on another Tor service. They validated with the same PGP key as now, and said eg &quot;My granduncle has a mole on his left eyelid.&quot; I note down this information privately and date it.<br /><br />Now suppose sometime later, I suspect SR has been fully compromised and is now actually the feds. The feds don&#039;t know this secret, since it wasn&#039;t in any of the logs they got, and SR didn&#039;t mention it to them.<br /><br />What I can do is post the following challenge publicly:<br /><br />&quot;If you are the real SR: remember the conversation we had? Decrypt this message using the key &quot;[relative]-[distinguishing mark]-[location]&quot;, no spaces.&quot; (I.e. &quot;granduncle-mole-lefteyelid&quot;)<br /><br />I create a signed message like so (gpg -a --clearsign -s -u FFB74377):<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Whoever decrypted this was Silk Road as of 2010-4-23.&nbsp; <br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)<br /><br />iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJO1468AAoJEDuHYd3NEX2Ndt0P/j2uRzBJsl6nzCR1iOp3dcP7<br />AHqpGfyARTdG2DPQ80zWxCI7NDH+rTFO2mBn7Mkg0iuewBv0nJVHNLVAKk6L8tHX<br />8J0xUXm6zB9GdM175euPWBsn3Sv8CgBVf3hfOo9ZWLblwJa/a+Ll6/hB+Ft11lqu<br />JolFYcdOiQZwHuMyruMLDWBkrgiibxDAPUJC2AyIs9dBFJHZPVm/GiorNLIFQXHV<br />mQqg+kxdrZfhqnfdEUTdwTQ87dUQI+hA+ozKaPoVmIUKx8/j3TXlsPt8bEV783aA<br />rFJUkFlZZK2AZoiFDgMCOHODOiEu/AQKa3kfJg1AbcMPuW/UDABXdV/GBBdvVryf<br />yhlCx6SWuTGBWLdDLOvZHrjqnn54BuTZ71jnq0ErqdLoej6K/GomLnmwzKqXMVvF<br />SsUz4/HVIPbKzLh4iqFX9Ql5ZQj1XrFo8kjHV8HDoN1AeHx7CmUwNWOGLN4fSAr/<br />xhvwSUhwX9B8jSCNQsIQ5CjgY2zgiIvwdJn6ZWHkOxr0fIciwLcrpZWBebFSmWKS<br />wP9fqsF7suGHqDX+GVaDZUspfBE/IBxVGEqwyDq/W8OP/VgQw0GMBL0k4DOO3Mvu<br />AmATrIKzHK7L0aXw54n7C3+kbzC8gVEc9hxOb65cE0a+pXC+tLywUdpCNMu5em6r<br />vHuMC6yHRA+qWtE3r0FT<br />=uWwr<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />This message itself can be proven legit by anyone who trusts key FFB74377.<br /><br />I don&#039;t post *that* message, of course.

Since the passphrase is based (hopefully) on a secret that only I and SR share, that proves that they are in fact SR (as of the date I received the secret). They can prove this easily by decrypting it and posting the previous, clearsigned statement. Try it for yourself.<br /><br /><br />Sellers: <br /><br />a) Cops or phishers are performing a MITM attack. They post their own PGP key, pretending it&#039;s the seller&#039;s. When the buyer sends them their info, they decrypt it and send it to the real seller (with a new key pretending to be the buyer, just like mine above pretending to be SR), and vice versa. In other words, they just MITM the PGP conversation.<br /><br />Limitation: they don&#039;t actually have the seller nailed IRL; they only have either compromised their SR account or the SR site itself. So they can&#039;t control what the seller does IRL.<br /><br />b) Cops have completely compromised the seller IRL. They continue operating their business as usual to get more info before prosecutions. They have the seller&#039;s real PGP key and secret, samples of their packaging, everything.<br /><br />Limitations: they may not have access to the seller&#039;s supply chain (unless the seller ratted &#039;em out), so once they run out of the seller&#039;s stockpile, they&#039;ll have to start using product they get from elsewhere, and buyers might notice this. They might not replicate the seller&#039;s communication style well (this is more subjective). And the same thing as above about secrets.<br /><br /><br />There&#039;s an easy, definitive defense against (a): the seller includes a small message printout in their package, signed with the PGP key you posted on their seller account. It doesn&#039;t need to say anything substantive, but it MUST include the current date (e.g. &quot;Thanks! Shipped 1 Dec 2011&quot;). This proves that the person who packed the product (who is the &quot;real&quot; seller when it comes down to it) owns the PGP key that was published.<br /><br />If they get a slip with an implausibly old ship date, that&#039;s a red flag for compromise.<br /><br />*Weak* (non-definitive) proof that the seller owns the PGP key is receiving product without that slip. This only proves that the message encoded to that PGP key got to the seller and was acted on — it doesn&#039;t rule out a MITM attack like in (a).<br /><br />(b) can only be defended against by being (subjectively) suspicious of a change in product or communication style, or using the shared-secret method above.<br /><br /><br />Buyers: <br /><br />This one is hard, in that the only thing you get from buyers is payment. You have no way to prove that they&#039;re a real buyer and not a cop, that they actually received the envelope you sent (vs it going to some police warehouse and the buyer pretending it&#039;s all good), etc.<br /><br />There are however a couple methods.<br /><br />a) Successfully receiving payment from a buyer proves only that they are able to pay. This is a weak proof of their identity, but it&#039;s at least something.<br /><br />b) Sellers can include a UNIQUE serial number slip on the inside of each package. Buyer then sends you signed a message saying &quot;I received a package with serial number 12381238&quot;. This proves at least that they have some control over the receipt of the package, and that the package was not intercepted en route by the postal inspectors and then sent on its way. It doesn&#039;t prove that the buyer themselves isn&#039;t a cop, of course.<br /><br />To be really secure, this requires using packaging that&#039;s truly tamper-evident AND hard for the PIs to duplicate. That&#039;s relatively difficult; you have to have some source of bags or stickers that the PIs don&#039;t.<br /><br />This is a moderate proof of their identity.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how to authenticate the identity of a buyer any better than that.<br /><br /><br />So there you go: an expert&#039;s advice for how to really prove you&#039;re you when we&#039;re all anonymous.<br /><br />Do with it what you will.

				My 2c:<br /><br />This is almost certainly not LE. Think about it, there are so many jurisdictional issues. Sellers and buyers are located all over the world. Who knows where the servers are located. No LE organization in the world would go through the trouble to re-route the site and build evidence against sellers and buyers from tons of different jurisdictions. If they could compromise the site enough to redirect it and collect evidence, they surely could just shut the site down, and it&#039;s way more likely they would do that. Plus, drug enforcement resources are being used to stop kilo-weight movers, not people who send gram-weights through the mail. ALSO, is talking about drugs and sending money through a website against the law? Nope. Is it probable cause? Eh, not really. You won&#039;t get in trouble unless cops LEGALLY find drugs in your possession. Plus do you think a jury of your peers will have ANY IDEA what the fuck a prosecutor is talking about when they try to explain Tor and PGP and all that? If sellers and buyers use common sense about their stashes, receiving addresses, encryption, etc, LE should never be an issue.<br /><br />As far as phishing goes, correct me if I&#039;m wrong but most phishers want to stay low-key. Changing the URL is certainly not low-key. For this to be phishing, the phishers would have needed to compromise the SR account here, the entire site code and all associated security. Then what? What&#039;s their plan? Get people to trust the site again and eventually suck all the BTC out of everyone&#039;s account? If you&#039;re worried about this, keep your BTC in an instawallet and don&#039;t let them sit in SR for too long. But really, what would happen if this was a massive phishing attack and everyone here lost their BTC? The price of a BTC would TANK immediately and those phishers would be left with pennies. Not worth the effort.<br /><br />IMO it&#039;s way more important to be paranoid about not revealing your personal information and general IRL drug possession issues. <br /><br />Common things are common. Uncommon things are uncommon. Occam&#039;s razor. Think horses not zebras. Buy some benzos. Have a drink.

				I&#039;d just like to elaborate, my entire argument here is that the biggest risk lies with the physical drugs. If people do a good job of keeping their location anonymous and their drugs secure there should be no huge issues. Following all security measures including encryption should keep your location anonymous regardless of if LE was running the site or not.

I had read before that the laws required both talking about doing something and then someone actually had to do some little piece of the plan before it was a crime. Which is it?<br />A: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the current US federal controlled substances laws are a kafkaesque nightmare. There is something which is often referred to as &quot;the drug exception to the Constitution&quot; or &quot;the drug exception to common sense&quot;. In this case, there is a &quot;drug exception&quot; to the normal requirements for a conspiracy conviction.<br /><br />Under US federal law, most conspiracy crimes require both an agreement between two or more people and some sort of action intended to work towards completing the plan by any of the people involved with the plan. For instance the law banning &quot;Conspiracy to commit an offense or defraud the United States&quot; (18 U.S.C. § 371) states that it is a crime:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy... <br /><br />And this is what is commonly thought of as the requirements for a conspiracy conviction.<br /><br />However, in the case of crimes involving controlled substances, the law is different and removes the &quot;any act to effect the object&quot; language: (21 U.S.C. § 846)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy. <br /><br /><br />This makes simply talking about committing a drug crime (for instance talking about buying cannabis or talking about growing cannabis) potentially criminal. Although it is important to note that a prosecutor has to prove that an actual conspiracy or &quot;agreement&quot; had taken place, if two people agree to possess/distribute/manufacture a controlled substance, then they are guilty under this statute. The implication that the individual is as guilty and punishable for talking about buying cannabis as they are for actually buying it can certainly seem chilling.<br /><br />The immediate reaction of most who hear this is disbelief. A typical response might be &quot;That can&#039;t be Constitutional, I have a right to talk about whatever I want to talk about so long as I don&#039;t actually do anything else.&quot;<br /><br />But, unfortunately, there have been several challenges to this law and the Supreme Court of the United states ruled unanimously in 1994 in the case United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10 (1994) that the federal law was enforceable as it was written. A lower court, the more civil-rights-oriented US Ninth Circuit of the West Coast, had ruled that there had to be some actual activity beyond talking before a felony had been committed.<br /><br />Justice O&#039;Connor, writing for the unanimous Supreme Court stated it very clearly:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; What the Ninth Circuit failed to recognize we now make explicit: In order to establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, the Government need not prove the commission of any overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. ( US vs Shabani, 1994 http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-981.ZS.html ) <br /><br /><br />The following are additional references to cases where the law was challenged in a number of ways: &quot;void for vagueness&quot; (laws in the US can be invalid if they are very vague about exactly what action would be criminal, although this protection has largely been eliminated by Supreme Court decisions), right to freedom of speech, right to assemble and associate, and protections against criminalizing status. All constitutional challenges have so far failed.<br /><br />U.S. v. Pulido, C.A.7 (Ill.) 1995, 69 F.3d 192 : Found that the drug conspiracy statute did not violate the First Amendment&#039;s protection of speech and thought because criminal agreement itself is an action (actus reus).<br /><br />U. S. v. Cooper, C.A.5 (La.) 1979, 606 F.2d 96, certiorari denied 100 S.Ct. 685, 444 U.S. 1024, 62 L.Ed.2d 657: Found that the section in question did not place impermissible restrictions on freedoms of association and expression under the First Amendment.<br /><br />U. S. v. Cooper, C.A.5 (La.) 1979, 606 F.2d 96, certiorari denied 100 S.Ct. 685, 444 U.S. 1024, 62 L.Ed.2d 657 : Found that the law provided adequate notice under common law that any agreement to purchase and distribute totally prohibited substances such as heroin would be a violation of the law and does not violate the Fifth Amendment&#039;s requirement of due process.<br /><br />U. S. v. Hayes, C.A.5 (Tex.) 1979, 595 F.2d 258, rehearing denied 598 F.2d 620, certiorari denied 100 S.Ct. 138, 444 U.S. 866, 62 L.Ed.2d 89 : Found that the law was not unconstritutionally vague and convicted a pharmacist of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance.<br /><br />U. S. v. Umentum, E.D.Wis.1975, 401 F.Supp. 746, affirmed 547 F.2d 987, certiorari denied 97 S.Ct. 1677, 430 U.S. 983, 52 L.Ed.2d 376 : Found that this law did not violate the First Amendment. It also denied the theory that this law could violate the protection against &#039;crimes of status&#039; which protects individuals from being prosecuted for simply being an alcoholic or a drug addict. This law requires the act of agreement or planning and thus does not punish for status alone.<br /><br />U. S. v. Amidzich, E.D.Wis.1975, 396 F.Supp. 1140: Found that this law does not impermissibly infringe on the First Amendment&#039;s protection of collective conversation.<br /><br />U. S. v. Sanchez, N.D.Tex.1973, 380 F.Supp. 1260, affirmed 508 F.2d 388, certiorari denied 96 S.Ct. 45, 423 U.S. 827, 46 L.Ed.2d 44 : Also found the law constitutional and denied the defendent&#039;s challenge.<br /><br />The main thing that concerns civil libertarians about this type of law is not that it, by itself, endangers the freedom of the people but that it is one of many laws which have been passed and found Constitutional which produce a society in which everyone is at constant risk of committing a felony. Idle conversations about going to the park and trying to buy cannabis, although they will never be prosecuted, could be technically illegal.<br /><br />This law is one of many which brings into sharp relief the question of what constitutes criminal activity. Not only are there laws against consensual activities but laws which ban agreeing to engage in a consensual act as an adult. Should a democratic society allow such a broad definition of felonious action that it justifies universal surveillance (the panopticon)? What effects does it have on a society over the long term of creating a pervasive sense that arbitrary and disproportionate enforcement are the norm?<br /><br />Hope that answers your question,<br />earth<br />[/quote]

				Ok, so after reading this thread, I am in the convinced-but-skeptical camp that the new site is legit. What I am NOT convinced of, however, is that SR knows WTF they&#039;re doing. My faith that this whole thing is being operated properly has REALLY been shaken. If they can manage to botch a URI change this horribly, WHAT ELSE ARE THEY FUCKING UP ON?<br /><br />I was planning to transfer some cash to my BTC broker today and make a SR order tomorrow, but I&#039;m very seriously considering hanging on to that cash to take it to my IRL supplier instead. Which kinda sucks, &#039;cause it has proven way more convenient and faster for me to buy via SR. But I&#039;m less than thrilled by the prospect of conducting my illegal transactions via a total bullshit amateur operation run by idiots.<br /><br />There is no PGP signature for competence. Competence can only be validated by one&#039;s actions - a test that SR has most definitely failed by my books.

				While public key cryptography cannot eliminate the risk of SR being compromised IRL, it seems much more likely that just the server would be compromised, in which case gpg signatures will prevent us from being fooled. So it may not eliminate risk but it reduces it.

				if (hypothetically) SR was compromised and the new url was a phishing page, wouldn&#039;t that cause huge tidal waves by now? I mean everyone of the staff team would post tons of warnings, and it would spread over every possible channel. (Unless the new url hasn&#039;t been noticed yet, but this is barely possible).<br /><br />That&#039;s why I think the new url is legit.<br /><br />But I get a &quot;not valid&quot; too when I try to verify the signed pgp message from the old url. And I must admit that this makes me lift my eyebrows =) but isn&#039;t that just because the SR-Staff uses a normal (anonymous) public key that isn&#039;t verified on a trusted&nbsp; official key server?<br /><br />(When I encrypt messages for other SR-users I always get a message like &quot;this key isn&#039;t verified. are you sure this key belongs to this person?&quot; but probably I&#039;m wrong and this has nothing to do with the problem)<br /><br />I hope things will be clear soon.<br /><br />Enjoy the weekend ;)

				This is probably better moved to the security forum... but continuing the security lessons, my approach is to get the important keys (SR, sellers I trust, etc.) from their personal pages on the SR marketplace site itself, well before shit like this happens.

Someone ties your SR handle / key to a seller, vaguely. Doesn&#039;t prove much from a legal standpoint (very circumstantial) and hopefully you&#039;ll trash that identity at the first sign of problems anyway.<br /><br />The utility is mainly if you trust A and a trusts B, to indicate to you that B is probably legit. Signatures of people you don&#039;t know (and nobody whom you know knows) are not useful.

It&#039;s entirely possible that buyers might come to know and trust each other, etc etc.<br /><br />b) You can acquire trust in one way, and display it in another. For example, if a seller has bought from another seller, as a separate buyer identity, they can still sign the other seller&#039;s key with their seller identity. All they need to do is wait a little bit to make sure that the other seller doesn&#039;t know which buyer account is theirs. Their two identities can stay separated, and they can use the trust others have in their public (seller) identity to encourage trust in another seller&#039;s public identity.

				Hi,<br />I haven&#039;t checked SR in a while and I can&#039;t seem to login at the new domain - I am almost certain I am using the correct password. Is there any way I can check that my account has not be hacked or attempt to recover it?<br /><br />Edit: ignore this, it is working now but the user ids appear to have changed. Why is this?

				There seems to be about 3-4 &quot;new&quot; url&#039;s.I am still getting onto silkroad via wiki,then click the green url and that sendsme straight to signing in,the only thing that has changed for me is that you don&#039;t get all that writing on the screen now.It&#039;s just a simple log in.

				Memorize or bookmark the &#039;silkroadvb5piz3r&#039; url (see what I did there? Purely from memory). Anything else is probably phishing for your login details to rip you off later or cause some kind of chaotic havoc you don&#039;t want.<br /><br />You should probably change all of your passwords or better yet, start all over with a completely different handle and password and only ever type the url mentioned in this thread in by hand or use a bookmark from when you typed it in by hand. If you don&#039;t, you&#039;re greatly increasing the chance that you&#039;ll be ripped off somehow/someway. <br /><br />Also, can we lock this thread now? There&#039;s nothing new about the onion url at this point.

				So I downloaded Tor, and quickly found the hidden wiki. From there, I followed a link on to the silkroad website (Big mistake, I know)<br />t<br />I tried to register an account, and a message told me to &#039;send a sum of 20BC to [long ass bitcoin address] to confirm your payment. <br />I immediately smelt a rat, and will no longer be accessing silkroad using the wiki..<br /><br /><br />I found this link through a bit of google browsing.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/<br /><br />&nbsp;Just to be clear, this is the current, uncompramised link to silkroad?<br /><br />(Apologies for bad grammar, English is not my first language :D)
