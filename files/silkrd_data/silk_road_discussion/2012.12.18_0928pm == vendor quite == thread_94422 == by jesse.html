				I&#039;ve really had it, fuck them!<br />All the other times I took their bullshit reason why AGAIN no way of login was possible.<br /><br />Not easy these days as many can testify.<br /><br />Today was the final drop, got in for a sec....customer in the messages, needed medication (cancer opiate painkillers)<br />Answered and gone....try for fucking 2 hours to get in.<br /><br />For all those aahhh, relax man....probably the ones selling or smoking pot....<br />This need to be in the mail tomorrow.<br /><br />I try another site like BMR and take my clients so there can be some guarantee we can do what we were suppose to do.<br />That was NOT pushing the refresh button for the whole fucking day!

Who in their right minds are going to set up an illegal trading site and let traders use it for free? If/when DPR is caught he and his associates are FUCKED. No two ways about it, they are getting nailed to the wall so excuse them for trying to make a bit of money from an operation that is without a doubt tricky as fuck to operate safely and a 24/7 job which could ultimately result in some serious jail time. <br /><br />You can&#039;t afford the sign up fee to vend? Put the work in the old fashioned way, how the fuck do you think people used to get their drugs? If you still can&#039;t get the sign up fee after working hard, you are probably not the type of vendor I would want on this site as you are probably shit at what you do.<br /><br />Here&#039;s an even better idea, why don&#039;t all you moaners pool your wisdom and knowledge and go and set up your own hidden service and show DPR how it&#039;s really done.<br /><br />I&#039;ll wait right here.

				There is validity in this rant IMHO...<br /><br />Yes SR is a great gift and opportunity, and I have immense respect and gratitude for DPR for creating this. And yes, there are probably many challenges to running a site of this nature that conventional sites do not face.<br /><br />All that being said though... This is a business, and massive money is moved on this site, and serious (and fair) commissions are paid to DPR (and whoever he might share that with). I don&#039;t feel that SR&#039;s life is limited as was suggested - I feel it could go on forever. But profits need to be plowed back into infrastructure and coding improvements so that the experience can be smoother, quicker, safer and more resilient against attack.<br /><br />As it is BitWasp will be available soon, and there will be alternatives to SR. Personally I would like to stay right here (and only work this site), and have SR remain the premier destination&nbsp; - even if there are alternatives. For vendors one market place is best - and frankly why not have it be this one?<br /><br />But spending 15 minutes just to get a login screen is a total fucking pain, and it need not be so. Sure there are great challenges, but given the revenues earned, a much slicker operation could be created. Tripling server capacity would be a good start, so there is not the constant&nbsp; w a i t i n g&nbsp; between&nbsp; pages, and refreshing again (and again) - it can really drag...<br /><br />I&#039;m not negative about this but would like to see more resource put back in to keep this thing on the cutting edge. I imagine there are many first time buyers who after their 10th attempt to get a login screen just leave in disgust. That is a loss of revenue for vendors and a loss of revenue for DPR. Not ideal...<br /><br />And I really mean it when I say I would love to be vending on SR 10 years from now. What a joy!<br /><br />BG

				We&#039;ve had problems logging for one single hour since the website went down a couple of weeks ago and we log more than once an hour to keep our business afloat. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what&#039;s the problem with so many problems logging in, but this problem is quasi non-existent from our point of view so that must not be the servers themselves eh?<br /><br />Though I have to admit this is getting weird, especially since the &quot;quick buy&quot; hack thing has been going on and a few reports of vendors not getting their money...

				SR is only technically a business - it has to operate differently because it&#039;s (highly) illegal. In a normal business, DPR is earning a fuckton of money so he would invest a small chunk of it on increasing infrastructure and then continue on to the bank but it&#039;s almost definitely not that simple from a safety perspective and safety is priority number one. And he would most definitely be interested in increasing the infrastructure because he would make more money but no amount of money is worth it if you&#039;re spending life in jail over it, I&#039;m sure we can all agree. We don&#039;t know anything about how the servers are set up and how he&#039;s avoiding heat, running a website is tough in general, running a clandestine one while pursued by the US federal government can&#039;t be easy. If it was as simple as spending more on increasing the reliability of the site, he would have. <br /><br />On that note, I haven&#039;t had any trouble at all connecting since that bit when it went down a few weeks ago
