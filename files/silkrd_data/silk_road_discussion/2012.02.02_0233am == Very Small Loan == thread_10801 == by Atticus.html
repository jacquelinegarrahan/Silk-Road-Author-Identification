				I apologize very much in advance for what I am about to ask. I know it is a common question, one many browsers of Silk Road despise to see, a question that confirms my position as an amateur in the field of Bitcoin. What&#039;s more I am unsure if this thread is even in the correct section of the forums. But, desperate times call for desperate measures.<br /><br />Due to Bitcoin fluctuations and my naive idea that I would have enough Bitcoins to make a purchase, I have fallen ฿0.43 short of the amount I need to make a purchase which must be made tonight if it stands any chance of arriving in time for when I need it. Therefore I must ask if there is anyone out there willing to lend me the ฿0.43 I need to complete my purchase?<br /><br />If someone is willing to do this for me I promise to pay them back in full as well as rounding it up to ฿0.5 (yes, I am serious, a whole ฿0.07 extra!). However the next time I will be adding more funds to my Silk Road account after this could be as late as a week or two&#039;s time. So if people aren&#039;t willing to wait that time I&#039;m willing to go to any length I can to get the money to them* which includes me being willing to go as far as offering services for you (I don&#039;t know what services I could offer, maybe finding files or downloading things that take a while with low amount of seeds and sending them to you, or making graphics (which I can do pretty well)) or even sending you money in the mail.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s a big ask, especially due to my disposition of struggling to pay the money back too soon (although it could be very soon, the reality is I just don&#039;t know when); but surely someone out there in this vast and wonderful online drug-smuggling community can look deep into the most distant and abstract sections of their loving heart and realize that it is a beautiful act of kindness that they will be enthralling onto the life of another.<br /><br />If there is anyone who is interested in this (I&#039;m making the offer and even I can&#039;t describe it as anything other than this) horrible offer then please mail me on this forum and I will send you the name of my Silk Road account where you can transfer the Bitcoins to.<br /><br />Thank you all very much.<br /><br />*The reason I can&#039;t just put enough money on to pay back tomorrow is that for me getting Bitcoin is a very long and complicated process which definitely takes a while so I only do it as rarely as possible - and on top of that I&#039;m very busy at the moment.

				Also, if anyone is aware of a way I can transfer money on Paypal (unverified account so I can&#039;t use Virwox) to some sort of other currency such as Western Union or the like and would like me to pay them through that please let me know because as long as I can retain most of my anonymity through that method I would be more than happy to pay directly for the ฿0.43 through that method.<br /><br />Love you all for being such a fucking wonderful online community; the community of hard drugs.

				I&#039;m in a terrific mood, so I will help you out. Message me your account number and I&#039;ll send you 0.43. Don&#039;t worry about rounding up, just pay me back the exact amount. Cheers.

				Unfortunately by the time I had sent divinechemicals the mail with my account number he had logged off only about two minutes beforehand (Last Active: Today at 02:58 AM) which is completely my own fault for not acting fast enough.<br /><br />However I&#039;m still short of the 0.43BTC and it&#039;s 4am now - is there anyone else that&#039;d be able to loan me the cash tonight?<br /><br />Thanks a lot to divinechemicals for the effort, I really apologize for not mailing in time.

				Ah, that&#039;s brilliant then mate! :D It&#039;d be great if you could still do it, that way I can get the order done. Thanks very much for this, I&#039;ll have the money repaid asap. :D

				Alright, you should have it now unless it takes a little bit of time. Pay it back whenever you get a chance, 2 weeks is fine or whatever. Hope this helps you with your purchase :)

				This helps a great deal, thank you very very much. :D I will pay back as soon as possible which is likely to be sooner than two weeks. You&#039;re a brilliant person - hope the rest of your SR experience goes well. :)<br /><br />Thanks again. :D
