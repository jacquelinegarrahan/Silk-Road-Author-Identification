				I actually think he is an alien. <br /><br />What I fear has happened is that basically all these really intelligent alien species with tentacles have been watching us over thousands of years and hoped that we would start loving each other and stop all the wars and polluting the world. <br />Basically with there not being that many planets in the Goldilocks zones of each solar system they all have to be utilised well otherwise the tentacly aliens would run out of intergalactic living space, So basically the nice aliens were faced with a predicament, Either get us to change our ways and become hippies that love the planet, or eradicate us and leave room for a nicer type of life form to thrive. <br /><br />So what happened then was that because the aliens don&#039;t really like wiping out whole species they decided to give us a last chance, And they put drugs on the world that make us better people.. However we are such fucktards that we decided to criminalise them and outcast people that use them.. The aliens were like WTF&gt;? Massive squelchy alien facepalm. And the alien overlord was like well guys we did everything we could, time to get rid of the pesky vermin, and he was about to send out a virus to kill us all when his second in command Commander Roberts was like No! I never give up on a species, no matter how vile. I will go to earth and try and make our original plan work. First I will need an identity. I will chose a pirate as they seem to like those.. <br /><br />So he comes down in his spaceship, invents TOR, cryptography and everything waits a while then sets up silk road... <br /><br />Before you laugh,, I have proof!<br /><br />The religion FSM *church of the flying spaghetti monster* Is actually based on when Cptn Roberts landed on earth. The flying spaghetti monster is actually a scared and hungry persons representation of Roberts in his true form with tentactles. Then changing into a pirate.. Read up on the religion if you don&#039;t believe me. Pirates are considered holy and shit.. <br /><br />Also all this need for secrecy is not for fear of prosecution, It&#039;s just we&#039;d all shit ourselves if we saw him in his true form.. No one has ever seen him which means he must either not exist or be an alien.. <br /><br />Also Drugs make you a nicer person, they make you an intelligent thinker.. Proof that we could have had fuck all to do in their creation.. <br /><br />SO basically, If you&#039;re listening, my noodly overlord weather it works or not, take me with you when you go back... PLEASE!<br /><br />I&#039;ve read too many stories of council estate girls getting pregnant at 13 to be able to continue living here. Too many makeup slathered girls posing with duck faces to be able to look at this world anymore.. I&#039;ll happily work as a cook on your planet and make you exquisite earth food, <br />ACE

				Hahaha I lulz at so many of these.<br />I&#039;d go with DPR really being a DMT entity or neo-CHUCK NORRIS haha.<br /><br />But in all seriousness def agree JahBuds:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=82802.msg616560#msg616560">Quote from: JahBUDS on November 22, 2012, 11:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Mr. DPR works hard.. for you and the rest of us to have a means of drug supply... without dealing with dodgy cartels.<br />But.. there will always be hating-ass ragers. :) So.. keep it up. You might actually get banned.. but then again.. Who would care?<br />You&#039;ll just make another troll account and come back. So.. kick rocks! Keep it moving!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DPR.. we all appreciate you and your tireless efforts of maintaining a healthy and successful business/website. :)<br />And in our honest opinions.. SR has been running lightning fast compared to how it used to be.. Even months before the down time.<br />We can click on a link and it will load like we&#039;re on the Clearnet. Kudos to DPR and the team that imagined the dream, built it, and gave us hope.<br />Thanks DPR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
