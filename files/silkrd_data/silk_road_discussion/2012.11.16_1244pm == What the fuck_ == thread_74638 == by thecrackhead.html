				We are the biggest international drug market known to the planet Earth and we can&#039;t stop a fucking bot spamming the shit out of the forum? WHAT THE FUCK?<br /><br />I understand that DPR and the team are busy and trying their best to make the community as pleasant as possible but seriously? It&#039;s been like this forever. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a computer expert but I really, really think it doesn&#039;t take ages to implement a minimum security feature that will stop this shit.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t agree with me you have to be an idiot or the bot itself.<br /><br />None of the Administrators or Mods are ever looking at Technical support and Feature Requests. I don&#039;t see the point of those boards. <br /><br />A board called &quot;Stick your dick in mtljohns mom&quot; would be more useful.<br /><br />I really hope you understand my frustration.<br /><br />I love the concept of SR but please fix this shit!!!

				lol<br /><br />SMF’s built-in features to help reduce spam<br /><br />In your forum’s Administration panel, under Security and Moderation (hover over the Configuration tab), there is a link to Anti-Spam. You should click on this link to go to the built-in anti-spam features that SMF has to offer. Here, you can adjust all the anti-spam features that SMF has to offer. You can decide whether or not guests have to fill out a verification (CAPTCHA Code) on registration, guest searches, guests reporting of posts, guest posting (I recommend to NOT allow guest posts due to spamming) and you can even require verification until a member reaches a certain amount of posts. You should check most of these boxes. However, you should know that CAPTCHA should not be taken as your single line of defense against spam as it is often broken through by spam bots and human spammers.<br /><br />So this is a good time to move down to the Configure Verification Options and Verification Questions (on the Anti-Spam page). I wouldn’t be so worried about what to set the Verification Images to be (I personally choose simple) but I would enable the Questions Verification as this feature is often one of the best lines of defense on an SMF community. SMF really made a great choice by implementing this anti-spam feature. I personally set mine to where a new member only has to answer one question. You can choose how many you want but I would keep it 1 to 3 questions only so a real member doesn’t have to be annoyed by having to answer a bunch of verification questions.<br /><br />When you create your questions, don’t make simple ones and stay away from math problems. Math problems on these systems are often beat by spammers and often too hard for people to answer. I myself am not good at math at all and if the question is too hard, I just choose not to register because of that and that is bad for marketing. Instead, make your questions have to do with your niche. You can make them a bit difficult to answer if related to your niche because most likely, people will look the answer up (the real members that is) because they are taking interest in the niche and want to learn more about it. I would also make as many questions and answers as you can so that you don’t have the same ones over and over again which could be beaten by spammers eventually.
