				thank you for the heads up DPR i to never used it for anything important but if you have been using it for any day to day business without encryption you must move your stock asap take no chances and be ready to be raided all ways think worse case scenario and say nothing.<br /><br />this is a lesson to us all and if you dont currently use pgp i suggest you start to learn it now as this can make the difference between being free or not....... stay on your toes and one step ahead,<br /><br />good luck my friends stay safe.......<br /><br />R&nbsp; &nbsp;

				They likely would still need a specific warrant for each account to see the contents of emails just like they would with any other email provider. I believe they need less to see the headers and subject but for the actual content they need to show probable cause to a judge to get access to the content. Assuming this is in the USA or some similar country.

				Well, I say live and learn, There are many people working on the actual coding of the script as we speak and figuring out exactly whatit does and how it does it. Now. Lets assume the worst because that way no matter how we act it can be in good judgement. So from now on :<br /><br />.Make sure Noscript is turned off! <br />.Encrypt everything, And i mean everything. Any questions about drugs , because that is intent to import narcotics even if you dont buy them. <br />.Do NOT download any dodgy files from non trusted sellers on SR, The feds could just as easily fit exploits with backdoors into any file you download, Say hacking ebooks for instance, I have seen 3 members complain of the same problem as stated by mclovin below.<br />.Always ALWAYS verify the Image of tails, or whatever you use. <br />.Never connect to Tor from a normal browser, Obvious but people do it.<br />.Keep an eye out and report anything suspicious, I know it may seem very &quot;ratty&quot; however we are in a new age now, Where everything needs to be watched. Lets say you see something but dont post it as you dint want to be ridiculed, And then as a result 10 people get busted. They lose their jobs, Their families could be taken away from them or left hungry, And Jailtime could be a high probability, all for combating the war on drugs.<br />It&#039;s an anonymous forum, So your not losing any face, Fucksake if you care about that then you are in a very bad position.<br />.DO NOT TRUST ANYONE, I have seen to many people talking about stories that could identify them. <br /><br />Anything you wish to add DPR??

				Big lesson for all the folks bitching about learning PGP<br />Here is the best read i found so far.<br />http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/researchers-say-tor-targeted-malware-phoned-home-to-nsa/<br />Looks like they left a calling card either to boast or scare deepnet enthusiasts. I would abandon trying to log in to tormail. My box will never be visited by me again but luckily I never really used it.<br /><br />ALSO - Windows OS, ditch it. Linux or Mac were not affected if I have my info correct (please chime in if this is wrong) and disable Javascript when you update TOR.<br /><br />Ever since I started using SR the big advice was to encrypt. I was advised to ditch hushmail and use tormail but really there is NO email or communication client that is 100% secure . Always assume mails will be read by a third party and ENCRYPT.<br /><br />This mighty be the next thing to read...<br />http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/08/crytpo-experts-issue-a-call-to-arms-to-avert-the-cryptopocalypse/

The probable cause is in the email and you know there is no respect for the rules of privacy. Big brother cannot tolerate privacy; people can misbehave if they are allowed it.<br /><br />It&#039;s an unfortunate world where our governments are so powerful that people are not even able to publicize how in the wrong they are. Something comes up on the news that is actually important like an employee leaking top secret government plans of spying on its own citizens and it is forgotten about within a week or two. No one rallied to have the government pass legislation to change things, no one tore the NSA building to the ground. We all just carried on which gives the government permission to do these things.

				&quot;The exploit attacked a vulnerability in the Windows version of the Firefox Extended Support Release&nbsp; 17 browser—the one used previously in the Tor Project&#039;s Tor Browser Bundle (TBB).&nbsp; That vulnerability had been patched by Mozilla in June, and the updated browser is now part of TBB.

				Please help me understand this. I went to the Tormail page the other day and saw the message saying the site was down. I didn&#039;t log in to a Tormail account, obviously, because the site was down. But doing this perhaps caused some malicious code or some such thing to be sent to my computer, and this code discovered by true IP address and sent it to the feds. So far, if they know who I am, they know I attempted to go to the login page of an email provider, which is hardly a crime.<br /><br />Now, we can reasonably assume that LE has access to all the unencrypted emails ever sent or received through Tormail. So if I created an account, while using Tor, and logged into that account, while using Tor, several weeks or months ago and sent an unencrypted email discussing something illegal, the code I just described in the first paragraph could hardly identify the author of that email. Could it? I just don&#039;t see the connection. Of course my Tormail account didn&#039;t have any information that would personally identify me, and the last time I logged into it was weeks ago.<br /><br />So the IP-identifying code injection and the reading of Tormail messages by LE are two totally different things, correct? Not the same thing? Thanks in advance for any insight.

				Shit. Several months back I bought BTC on tormail and the vendor claimed he didn&#039;t see the deposit, and asked for proof of the receipt. This obviously worried me, so i rushed and sent him a pic of the deposit receipt from my phone! Should I be worried???

				This warning is deeply appreciated as well as somewhat disturbing.&nbsp; While I did make a tormail account especially for my SR account and it is currently showing in my forum info, so far, no one has contacted me via that - only PM, as well as I&#039;ve not contacted anyone from SR using it either.&nbsp; I will remove the tormail from my forum profile after I&#039;m done with this post... though I doubt I will delete it either as from what I&#039;ve read from several others who have already responded here, it sounds like it would be best to simply never log in again.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I&#039;m not concerned with any SR related problems personally..... or from me to any other SR user I&#039;ve dealt with as no dealings have taken place on tormail.&nbsp; &nbsp;At least I think there is not problem in this regard... if anyone thinks there might be anyway, please let me know.....&nbsp; Thanks<br /><br />However, the part that I find disturbing is that I have over the course of time, made several tormail accounts... all with different usernames and passwords.&nbsp; I generally did this because each one was for dealing with a specific topic or person/business.&nbsp; I also had made a couple of them that I had used for my personal email account (which is how I even found the SR...&nbsp; I had found TOR because a while back, circumstances caused me to have need for as anonymous of an email account as I could possibly find... and I had thought that was Tormail.)&nbsp; I had believed that due to the fact that is is run on a relay, with each relay not knowing what IP belongs to whom, and not by a private company that could/probably did/does keep logs, that it was probably a secure enough way to communicate with average friends from R/L.&nbsp; However, the news that Freedom Host has been seized along with many other sites (including tormail) that had been hosted with them, makes all the previous info I had gathered about tormail irrelevant.&nbsp; I suppose that there is nothing I can do at this point about any prior info exchanged on those tormail accounts that I had regarded as personal email accounts.. other than to abandon them and let those with whom I had been communicating with on them know not to use them anymore.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor (on or offline) of anything illegal.. or anything at all.&nbsp; Still, nothing written of a personal nature was meant for anyone other than the sender and recipient(s) of the emails.. certainly not the government...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />One other thing, I noticed so far in reading what others have written in this thread is that at least one person, possibly more, have inquired about the existance of another email service that is anonymous and not under control of any branch of LE/government.&nbsp; I would also like to know if anyone has any answer???&nbsp; &nbsp;I did find an email provider about a month ago called noipmail.comm which claims not to keep any logs or have knowledge of who you are....&nbsp; &nbsp;but they only allow one account per person.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t know who you are....&nbsp; how could they prevent one from creating more than one account?&nbsp; Hmmm...&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; &nbsp; So, if anyone knows of a more secure email provider...&nbsp; &nbsp;please enlighten?&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks much :)

				PC Security tips:<br /><br />1.) Tor Browser Bundle includes the NoScript add-on, turned on by default, at least as of version 17.0.7, which prevents ALL javascript from running within the Tor browser, so no action is necessary there.&nbsp; You do not need to go into the Browser &gt; Options &gt; Content and unclick Enable Javascript, as NoScript handles this (but you could anyway just for an EXTRA layer of protection.)<br /><br />2.) UNINSTALL JAVA (on Windows from Add/Remove programs).&nbsp; It is a serious security risk, period.&nbsp; Doing so probably won&#039;t break any apps, but if it does, you can always reinstall it if need be but at the very least make sure you DISABLE IT from any browsers you use.&nbsp; (this does not apply to Tor)<br /><br />#3) Adobe PDF Reader is the second most exploited software next to Java.&nbsp; UNINSTALL IT and install Foxit Reader instead (and KEEP IT UP TO DATE since, though far less likely, it could be exploited).&nbsp; <br /><br />#4) Now would be a good time to check for updates for any software which you run regularly, as security fixes come out all the time and you&#039;re security is only as good as your weakest link.<br /><br />

				Also, I believe PGP encryption should become mandatory on SR.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because knowing that messages could potentially contain very useful information makes targeting SR all the more lucrative for LE.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it is a good practice to delete messages that you no longer need.&nbsp; You can delete all messages at once using the option to the right from within messages (you need to do this for Inbox, and then for Sent).<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re a buyer going &quot;why should I have to use PGP, this only affects me&quot; -- WRONG!!!!!!&nbsp; Your information is a piece of a larger puzzle and the more pieces they can put together to gather intelligence, the riskier SR becomes for EVERYONE.&nbsp; If your unencrypted information helps bust a vendor that I have dealt with, for example, and that vendor has my information because they were sloppy with their security too, then I am at risk.&nbsp; We cannot eliminate 100% risk but anything we can do to reduce risk is worth doing, IMO.<br /><br />DPR: this might be a road-bump worth hitting.<br /><br />Now there are lots of guides out there that explain PGP but not quite from the angle of someone using SR.&nbsp; For example, it is not smart to keep the public key of a vendor you&#039;ve done business with on an unencrypted hard drive.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because that it could theoretically be used as evidence, especially if the only public keys you&#039;ve got are from SR vendors.&nbsp; Similarly, you should not keep your own key stored on an unencrypted drive for the same reason, especially if it contains anything remotely similar to your SR account.&nbsp; Personally, I feel a lot more needs to be written on how to use PGP in an even safer manner, on everything from where to install it, how to config your .conf file to increase security, all in the context of SR useage.<br /><br /><br />

				Something that surprisingly nobody clarified is that Java is not the same as Javascript.<br />Java SHOULD NEVER EVER be enabled EVEN if you are browsing normally on the clearnet for non-criminal innocent purposes.<br />Javascript was considered until now harmless because there is no way of actually programming anything in javascript to deanonymize anyone.<br />That hasn&#039;t changed.<br /><br />What changed is that the javascript engine in Firefox was flawed, and they took advantage of it to take over the browser itself and then forced it to install a program to call home with your mac address and your ip address. Javascript wasn&#039;t the problem, but its engine. It sounds like I am playing with semantics, but it is not. Keep reading.<br /><br />This is actually a wake up call, because the problem is not really javascript but the browser itself.<br />Anything could be used to exploit it currently as-is, even if you disable javascript, and even if you have no-script. <br />They could own your box with a specially malformed gif, if a vulnerability is discovered in the graphics rendering engine of the browser *WHICH ALREADY HAPPENED IN SEVERAL BROWSERS, INCLUDING FIREFOX*.<br />YES, YOU COULD, CAN, AND WILL GET -eventually- BE HACKED WITH A GIF, or a JPEG, or whatever image format.<br /><br />It is the same concept, as you must already know, images normally can&#039;t be used to deliver payload; in the very exact same way that javascript can&#039;t be normally be used to hack you. But once a bug is found in their respective engines that &quot;interprets&quot; images or javascript, it is game over.<br /><br />If you truly want to be absolutely safe and prevent future 0-days, you must disable everything, including images. <br />Even better, pure text based, going back to lynx. Fuck xml and css as well, who knows what&#039;s going to be found there in the future.<br />It will be quite challenging to browse a market without graphics, but that is going to be the only way to stay safe and prevent future ownage.

				I have been following the whole &quot;FH was busted&quot; line for a while now. <br /><br />I find the following odd<br /><br />#1) The first time this came up was a person who posted it to redit, linked to an article about a child porn distributor that was taken down in Ireland. (No mention of FH or TOR at all in the article)<br />#2) It has circulated for several days and has gotten bigger as it goes.<br />#3) The site has been up and down over the last couple of weeks, in various states of F-ed up. <br />#4) The Java exploit that was discussed was originally on a child porn site that was suspected of being on FH and not on the &quot;Temporary down&quot; page. It seems to have morphed over time.<br />#5) I have seen the temporary down page and it is flat HTML with no Iframes on it. The exploit was calmed to be in an iframe call.<br /><br />The reason it smells off to me is that <br /><br />#1) If the feds had taken down a child porn site on TOR or FH as a distributor, it would be news! They would blast that everywhere to scare potential TOR users away or make them think it is not as secure as it is.<br />#2) I have not seen any corroborating evidence that did not come from that first redit post. See #1!<br /><br />I am not saying it is safe or that the person who runs FH did not get busted. I am saying that I would not be surprised if this was a hoax and the site had been hacked. The owner working to get it back up and not paying attention to the posts floating around.<br /><br />BTW, tormail was up earlier today with the main page and the login page but when you tried to login it failed with a 404. There was No JS anywhere on the page, I checked.<br />

However, a few things to take into consideration. Somebody who is a major host of CP sites was indeed busted about the same time that Freedom Hosting went down. That could be a coincidence, or it could not be. The busted person certainly matches up with Freedom Hosting pretty well, he hosted dozens of websites with CP on them and had over one million images. All of the pedo&#039;s seem to think it is Freedom Hosting admin, as none of them can think of anyone else who hosted so many CP sites and so much content. In the recent past there were busts of similar sized CP rings, a few years ago in the Ukraine they busted a commercial CP service that ran dozens of sites and had a large number of images, but it was immediately clear from reading the article that it was not Freedom Hosting because they charged for access and took Paypal, and anyway some of the Pedos on Tor already knew about their operation. There was another pedo forum that got busted on Tor a few months ago, and that made the news as well, but they never mentioned that it was on the Tor Network. This is the site that they called &quot;Website A&quot; and ran undercover for a week or two busting members on it (I wonder with what exploit :/). After reading about it some more, it seems pretty conclusive that this was the Tor Hidden Service known as Pedo Forum. <br /><br />The second point is that people have obtained real exploit code off of the freedom hosting sites, so obviously somebody did inject exploit code into all of the websites on freedom hosting.<br /><br />Additionally, apparently the admin of one of the CP sites on Freedom Hosting collaborated the story that malicious javascript had been injected to his website.<br /><br />Additionally, the phone home IP address of the malicious javascript belongs to a company that provides hosting exclusively for the intelligence and law enforcement community in the USA.<br /><br />So all things considered, it seems to paint a ton of circumstantial evidence, although I also have not seen anything 100% conclusive yet.

				The FH server could be hosted anywhere in the world.

They are all about PR.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if the exploit was added not by seizing the server, but by hacking the server and the server was taken down by admin because it was difficult to get rid of.

(Talking about lashings, that&#039;s literally what those sexual public school boy freaks thrive on, preferably whilst administered by some old hag dressed in sweaty leather, with a reach around by an Angelic 11 year old Cherub from the &quot;Local Authority Home&quot; that they just happen to have a &quot;special relationship&quot; with- see Jimmy Saville for more info).

				Hi evryone and ty Dpr for the heads up&nbsp; I have a question&nbsp; I am new to sr and so far I bought a couple of things, a book which is legal being one of them; I run firefox with noscript, no adobe reader and I have java disabled in my tor browser, couple of standard av&#039;s on firefox (avast and avg) and every convo I have had with someone on sr has been encrypted; I tried to get a tormail acc a week ago but it refused to work for me and I shelved it meaning to go back once I had figured out why it wouldnt work; so no tormail account&nbsp; what I would like to know is what happens if sr is compromised; altho everything I have done is encrypted will my acc at sr reveal that I have indeed bought something, whatever it might be, and if I bought whatever it was from a vendor of illegal substances will LE beable to give me a hard time altho they wont know what it is I bought; in a nutshell if sr gets into trouble will all our accounts be available to LE?<br />&nbsp;I keep no public keys on this sys but reading all these posts I wonder can I run a tor browser and everything else associated with sr from a stick or portable hd which I could plug in and take away and hide when not in use so theres nothing on my pc to connect me with any darknet activity? I am not a computer whizz just someone doing their best to get by here so apolgies if this post is a bit naive<br /><br />I love SR!

				is this only affecting TORMAIL ,<br />OR is also the TOR NETWORK affected in any way ?<br /><br /><br />since, if tor network is affected, it probably means that SR is down soon,<br />since it only runs via TOR net.<br /><br />so my question to those knowing more about the matter :<br /><br />what about the tor network ?&nbsp; if it affected by this, too ?<br />=========================================<br /><br />if tor network is taken down ---&gt; sr is offline, since it only works over tor network :<br />do we have to expect this ?<br /><br />this could mean its a risk for vendors sending out orders since sr might be down<br />before it arrives and payment will be made (through escrow).<br /><br /><br />(is it possible to take tor network down completely, or is that technically not so easy since<br />there are many and widespread servers ? will it maybe only get slow when large servers are<br />taken down? i am not into that tech stuff, and so i worry about tor net might be going down (or at least VERY slow) soon.&nbsp; how about that?)<br /><br /><br />

(No mention of FH or TOR at all in the article)<br />#2) It has circulated for several days and has gotten bigger as it goes.<br />#3) The site has been up and down over the last couple of weeks, in various states of F-ed up. <br />#4) The Java exploit that was discussed was originally on a child porn site that was suspected of being on FH and not on the &quot;Temporary down&quot; page. It seems to have morphed over time.<br />#5) I have seen the temporary down page and it is flat HTML with no Iframes on it. The exploit was calmed to be in an iframe call.<br /><br />The reason it smells off to me is that <br /><br />#1) If the feds had taken down a child porn site on TOR or FH as a distributor, it would be news! They would blast that everywhere to scare potential TOR users away or make them think it is not as secure as it is.<br />#2) I have not seen any corroborating evidence that did not come from that first redit post. See #1!<br /><br />I am not saying it is safe or that the person who runs FH did not get busted. I am saying that I would not be surprised if this was a hoax and the site had been hacked. The owner working to get it back up and not paying attention to the posts floating around.<br /><br />BTW, tormail was up earlier today with the main page and the login page but when you tried to login it failed with a 404. There was No JS anywhere on the page, I checked.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes it does seem a bit odd to me as well, and my first impression was that it could be Anonymous PsyOps. However, a few things to take into consideration. Somebody who is a major host of CP sites was indeed busted about the same time that Freedom Hosting went down. That could be a coincidence, or it could not be. The busted person certainly matches up with Freedom Hosting pretty well, he hosted dozens of websites with CP on them and had over one million images. All of the pedo&#039;s seem to think it is Freedom Hosting admin, as none of them can think of anyone else who hosted so many CP sites and so much content. In the recent past there were busts of similar sized CP rings, a few years ago in the Ukraine they busted a commercial CP service that ran dozens of sites and had a large number of images, but it was immediately clear from reading the article that it was not Freedom Hosting because they charged for access and took Paypal, and anyway some of the Pedos on Tor already knew about their operation. There was another pedo forum that got busted on Tor a few months ago, and that made the news as well, but they never mentioned that it was on the Tor Network. This is the site that they called &quot;Website A&quot; and ran undercover for a week or two busting members on it (I wonder with what exploit :/). After reading about it some more, it seems pretty conclusive that this was the Tor Hidden Service known as Pedo Forum. <br /><br />The second point is that people have obtained real exploit code off of the freedom hosting sites, so obviously somebody did inject exploit code into all of the websites on freedom hosting.<br /><br />Additionally, apparently the admin of one of the CP sites on Freedom Hosting collaborated the story that malicious javascript had been injected to his website.<br /><br />Additionally, the phone home IP address of the malicious javascript belongs to a company that provides hosting exclusively for the intelligence and law enforcement community in the USA.<br /><br />So all things considered, it seems to paint a ton of circumstantial evidence, although I also have not seen anything 100% conclusive yet.<br />[/quote<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as kmfkewm said i tried to open tornmail,org and it opened. it then went to the link and got <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; moments.<br />&nbsp; if you are unable to load any pages, check your computer&#039;s network<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; connection.<br />&nbsp; If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; that TorBrowser is permitted to access the Web.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so last time i updated was april. so i just did now. this means i am ok if i did not see the the site maintnace page?

				To many people are throwing around opinions. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t heard many Answers being spoken here, only questions and possibilities. <br /><br />For now every body should plan for worst case scenario. You have some time to clean house, they have to connect the dots. The anonymity of TOR/SR/TORMAIL works in your favor. <br /><br />Though this was windows specific, the firefox tor uses with in mac/linux is based off windows NT and there has been reports of mac and also linux users being targeted. Who&#039;s to say the script only showed on the earlier versions, but went through without a trace on the most recent version. These are world powers, not script kids.<br /><br />Don&#039;t think you&#039;re safe. Plan for the worst. If you&#039;re tormail account matches your vendor ID and you have sent your address to any other vendors/suppliers unencrypted, you are screwed if the servers have been seized and the emails are still there.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s just a possibility. I&#039;m not going to post multiple different what ifs and out comes but simply to answer your question,&nbsp; I dare say a few big vendors are trusted by smaller new vendors, who may on sell their product. <br /><br />People often err on the side of error. Brief lapse in judgement, etc. <br /><br />Ontopic pls, You could have asked me that question in a PM.

				This is on the homepage of Tormail:<br /><br />&quot;or Mail consists of several servers, a Tor hidden service, and an incoming and outgoing internet facing mail servers.<br />These internet facing mail servers are relays, they relay mail in and out of the Tor network, the relays are purchased anonymously and not tracable to us.<br />The only thing stored on the hard drive of those servers is the Exim mail server, and the Tor software.<br /><br /><br />No emails or logs or anything important are stored on those servers, thus it doesn&#039;t matter if they are seized or shut down. SHOULD THIS MAKE US FEEL ANY SAFER?<br /><br /><br />We are prepared to quickly replace any relay that is taken offline for any reason.&quot;<br /><br />Does that mean they didn&#039;t have time to take the relay down?

				Hey Folks, fuck it.

There are other ways a browser can be exploited besides JavaScript, and the next payload that LE delivers may target Linux and OS X as well, but at least with Tails, if you are not running as root, it would be more difficult to bypass Tor. <br /><br />Whonix is even more secure than Tails, because bypassing Tor requires breaking out of the VM, and I haven&#039;t heard of an exploit for that in the last few years, although there have been privilege escalation exploits to gain root access on Linux (which would affect Tails). The downside is the VMs obviously exist on your hard drive so it&#039;s not a &quot;leave no trace&quot; solution like Tails, and the Workstation VM does not have disk encryption out of the box, so you&#039;d have to store it in an encrypted volume yourself, or install a custom OS with full disk encryption of the virtual hard disk. So making it safer in that regard is more difficult. Tails is more of a plug-n-play solution.<br />

				Ok so I have been trying to follow this thread but its just gone off in so many directions I have personally lost track of it all. So can we just clarify what we know is fact and what we need to do moving forward.<br /><br />So TorMail has been compromised. If you have used TorMail to discuss anything relating to orders that contains valid names or addresses, you should no doubt be concerned. At present we know it came in from some form of browser injection that found a vulnerability in Windows and Firefox. From what I can gather that is the ONLY fact that we currently really have, or have I missed something?<br /><br />My next question is what measures are people taking now to ensure additional security. Fortunately although I have a TorMail account in the same name as this user account, I am not a vendor and have never used the TorMail service for anything. I am not really concerned about what they might find in mine.<br /><br />I run TOR on OSX with the TOR Browser, I PGP anything I send address wise to vendors. TOR has not said its need updating although I have heard people mention they need to, or is this just for Windows?<br /><br />I know a lot of people with far more knowledge on the subject than me I have discussed SR and its security, but should we assume if they can do this to TorMail they could do it to SR, and be extra vigilant with our encryption, if a vendor does not have a PGP key then basically don&#039;t order from them??

				it just seems like everyone has a false sense of security when it comes to unix based systems....<br />it is not that hard to make a program( virus, backdoor, expolit,keylogger) applicable to all systems, you just need to make one code to each specific operating system or use a programing language that is applicable across each o/s you wish to infect and adjust the parameters accordingly. <br />the US government have programers and hackers at there disposal that are more then capable of this.

				When can this security warning on the homepage come down? I&#039;ve noticed a drop off in orders and I think the very prominent warning is scaring customers away. Anyone who was using Tormail is aware by now of the issues and I&#039;d hate to link all of this permanently to SR when it actually had nothing to do with SR. On top of that there has been a lot of irrational panic related to this considering how minor the forensics of the incident ultimately concluded. You may say better be on the safe side but regular normal people (buyers) are skittish to begin with thinking the DEA and CIA are going to send a 30 man SWAT raid on their house every time they order a gram of kush so to add to that mentality with security warnings that are not SR related I think is unnecessary even with security first always being the understandable mission.

The security warning should remain for the time being as not everyone logs on each day. I very much doubt that buyers are being scared off SR due to Tormail, a site completely unrelated to SR, now being compromised.

I&#039;ve noticed a drop off in orders and I think the very prominent warning is scaring customers away. Anyone who was using Tormail is aware by now of the issues and I&#039;d hate to link all of this permanently to SR when it actually had nothing to do with SR. On top of that there has been a lot of irrational panic related to this considering how minor the forensics of the incident ultimately concluded. You may say better be on the safe side but regular normal people (buyers) are skittish to begin with thinking the DEA and CIA are going to send a 30 man SWAT raid on their house every time they order a gram of kush so to add to that mentality with security warnings that are not SR related I think is unnecessary even with security first always being the understandable mission.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hardly think buyers are thinking &quot;the DEA and CIA are going to send a 30 man SWAT raid on their house every time they order a gram of kush&quot;.<br />That&#039;s an overreaction on your part.

The security warning should remain for the time being as not everyone logs on each day.

But luckily the order I made was very small it could pass as a user ordering stuff for personal use. <br /><br />And luckily the package arrived without and problem. That I know of yet. It was to a drop address I never order to my house.<br /><br />As for the old emails on there I did not get a chance to delete them a full month before the indecent but luckily there was talk of only a couple transactions. They have one small transaction. And talk of a few hundred g&#039;s from a past transaction.<br /><br />Now considering that what do they have on me?

They could have injected an exploit without taking physical control of the server, but the fact that the server was offline for a couple of days before coming back online with the exploit, and this happened after the presumptive admin was arrested, is pretty good evidence that LE had physical control of the server.<br /><br />For security reasons, we should operate under the assumption that they have physical control of the FH server, including the Tormail email database. That hard drive has a massive trove of data for them to sift through. Besides all the CP, there must have been tens of thousands of Tormail accounts, and potentially millions of emails. They will likely prioritize the biggest targets: major CP and drug distributors.<br /><br />If I was tasked with sifting through the data, I&#039;d go through the list of SR vendors, starting with the highest percentage rank, and see if they have Tormail addresses. Conveniently, StExo&#039;s archives are on that hard drive with all vendor profiles, so they don&#039;t have to crawl the SR server. Email addresses will be listed in the profiles or their PGP keys. About half of SR vendors had Tormail addresses, so they wouldn&#039;t be hard to find.<br /><br />That may not be how LE sifts through the data, but it seems logical to me, so if I was a top SR vendor, I would be extremely cautious right now, if I had a Tormail account with unencrypted emails in it.<br /><br />As for you, it could take months to years, or possibly never, before they get around to reading your emails, but to err on the side of safety, I would never use that shipping address, and probably never use that Chinese source again. Consider them both watched.<br />

				There&#039;s so many unanswered questions around tormail that I&#039;d really like answering but after looking around for a couple of hours there&#039;s just silence.<br /><br />according to one source, the tormail owner is in custody too, in others the owner is the FH guy who&#039;s been arrested.&nbsp; I read somewhere that the tormail set up is distributed so it may not all be on fh servers and I also read somewhere that the email dbs are encrypted.&nbsp; If it is the FH dude then I assume he will eventually do a deal to release the key to decrypt as part of a plea deal.&nbsp; I also haven&#039;t been able to find out how many accounts there were on tormail.<br /><br />The main thing is that I&#039;d assume tormail access is going to be given to all interested parties<br /><br />So cp first, I&#039;d say that they&#039;ll be running jobs to find any accounts that have emails with the cp keywords, they&#039;ll then start a secondary trawl for accounts that match the characteristics of a cp email account, which would encrypted documents and encrypted emails.&nbsp; which means it&#039;s possible that some sr accounts will be caught up in that and if there&#039;s no indication that it&#039;s drugs rather than cp, on inspection they&#039;ll end up on the list<br /><br />then of course there&#039;ll be the nsa running jobs to find guns, bombs, &quot;terrorist&quot; etc keywords and will be sniffing around the dissident accounts. (along with looking to see if Snowden left all his stuff on tormail)<br /><br />and the DEA will be looking for all the drug related keywords..&nbsp; which is possibly how some of the SR accounts will be caught.&nbsp; If there really are LE paying attention here then they probably will do the mapping of the vendor emails from SR and they&#039;ll also manually pick some of the more visible peeps who post, like the journos.&nbsp; More concerning for me is that guy who did the vendor survey a few months back.&nbsp; any vendor who didn&#039;t encrypt their answers and answered some of the more egregious questions about how they source their drugs are at a huge risk of a visit because I seem to remember him saying that he was going to keep everything on tormail.&nbsp; There&#039;s also that forum thread where people post their keys..&nbsp; a quick trawl of that will give them lot&#039;s of non vendor keys for people who may be using SR to source large quantities of drugs that are not being sold on via SR.&nbsp; and of course the thing to remember is that even if they can&#039;t decrypt the email contents, they know the email address that it was sent to/came from and I suspect (although have never tried) that it&#039;s trivial to get the public key email address of the sender/recipient from the message to see if it&#039;s different.<br /><br />and of course there&#039;s that lovely bit of software that they can feed all the data into to identify the contact networks of the email accounts.&nbsp; Which means no matter how many middle men have been used for deals, the trail will be highlighted.<br /><br />and this is before the xkey thing is used.<br /><br />It&#039;s enough to give anyone who used it nightmares.<br />

This is no longer about basic shit like having a strong PGP key and not giving out identifying info in your profile. If you&#039;re still doing that, you should be stripped of your vendor privileges immediately. We&#039;re on a new level now. We are being actively attacked by LE now. They won&#039;t go after all small time buyers, but if you are a vendor, mod or admin, you should be switching to a Whonix like setup, or installing PORTAL on your router, or an anonymizing middle box between your main computer and your router, and the computer you use for Tor should have no identifying info on it at all. And it should absolutely 100% not be Windows based. And it should go without saying at this point that you must encrypt EVERYTHING. Your hard drive, virtual disks, communications, etc.<br /><br />The arms race is on, and you better be ready before the next exploit is served through the market or forum servers.<br /><br />

You are the only person who can keep you secure, and you are the only person that you should rely on to keep you secure. <br /><br />And claiming that SR has already been exploited, when there is no evidence of that, is a disservice to the community, because it builds complacency. &quot;Oh well, I&#039;m already screwed.

With silk road we make a successful war against the war on drugs, and guess what, the only victims, are street dirty dealers getting out of business. <br /><br />Let this madness be forever. For if Silk Road dies, i die too. Long Live DPR, Long Live Silk Road, <br /><br />FUCK THE POLICE - fuck SR competitors, which can well be behind such attacks.<br /><br />Please everyone, try to stay safe, and use only vendors that you have used and trust. most important. don&#039;t lose faith. we can change the world with bitcoin.

				I don&#039;t think this vulnerability infected most people, unless it had been running for a long time undetected. If your TBB was updated since June you couldn&#039;t get affected. Why anyone would not update their browser is beyond me.<br /><br />However, I don&#039;t think these stories answer how this FH guy got caught in the first place. I doubt it was through the javascript vulnerability, they only use that to get info on the users. The stories say Irish police and FBI had been hunting him for like a year, so other unknown techniques were used to locate the server.<br /><br />Silk Road is next, spend those bitcoins fast, boys!

Drugs i do them cause i chose to do them. But fucking a child, even&nbsp; fucking a baby, Its not the choice of the child. <br />I do drugs because i don&#039;t like reality. I have a reason.<br />i wonder what causes a man to turn to being pedophile. If i had to guess, i must say that these pukes of our society, do it either for the money, or because they have tiny cock. And maybe fucking a child makes it look bigger to them.<br /><br />In anyway, keep in mind, that i am a druggie, and people can see that. Or at least many people can.&nbsp; I dont hurt anyone else than myself. But the CP.... you dont know who it can be. It can be the sir with the suit. Or the lady with the shop. <br />these hypocrites, that smile to the society, while abusing their babies, i think they dont deserve to exist, and there shall be no forgiveness in my opinion. <br /><br />And honestly, i dont know anyone that would wanted a junkie to die, just because is a junkie. This is no reason, it is only a fact.&nbsp; Most people i know, simply try to tell junkies that &quot;drugs will kill you, and you&#039;d better stop using them&quot;. On the other hand, i cant find one single person (other than you and the pedophile who supported openly that it should be legal to posses CP.) to disagree that pedophiles should die. <br /><br />For me, for once, i would say bravo to LE for that try. Please concentrate on that, bring down the pedophiles, and when you are done with it, you can focus on Silk Road (it will be ages until then) , but i find it a hypocrisy. If you (LE) want to stop it why you cant stop TOR? it is a joke really. I mean, i would hate my life if i could not find any drugs online anymore, but on the other hand, i would (try to) sacrifice my addiction, if i knew that TOR is brought down, and the vast majority of CP is getting busted. I would really try to stop using drugs if TOR died.<br />

It looks to me to be more of a commentary on the state of the world right now, as in &quot; things are so fucked up that I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if CP was legal everywhere soon&quot; . I, of course, 100% disagree with the statement, but I&#039;m not about to jump on this dude for being a pedo when he made no such insinuations.

Let&#039;s say LE put up a site and put on link on these forums to go to it. You access that site without TOR and with your normal browser the owner of that site now has the IP addresses of all the people who visited it. If the only link they post is in these forums than every single person who visits that site did so because they were on the SR forums which would warrant further investigation. Basically it&#039;s to tell people to only access those sites over The Onion Relay. Hope that helped.<br />« Last Edit: May 12, 2013, 04:49 pm by DanDanTheIceCreamMan »<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Don&#039;t do this. Generally you *want* to visit links from the forum only over Tor.<br /><br />Edited to add:<br />Be careful about clicking on any user posted links on this forum. The link could be an attempt to attack you.<br />You must think about everything you are doing. If you are not sure then the best thing to do is to stay on trusted websites (the SR and the SR forums).

				Since the SR forum seems to require a real email, and many have used tormail email addresses there, is it safe to switch in a fake, nonexistent email for now?<br /><br />And what are the best alternatives to Tormail now that aren&#039;t compromised?&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone know if torguard . net&nbsp; is a good alternative? (I didn&#039;t want to post the actual link since link-posting paranoia is high at the moment)&nbsp; They say they&#039;re tor and PGP-based, and offshore (which technically would help against the NSA/govt access to emails older than 30 (or is it 60) days, which they consider legally &quot;abandoned&quot; and thus obtainable).<br /><br />I looked a hushmail and i think the consensus there is that it&#039;s totally open to government access if and when they want it, so it&#039;s pretty much out.&nbsp; I guess encrypting every single email would help.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I think a true hidden service email that&#039;s independent, tor-based, uses https encryption, perhaps has PGP built in, and then using PGP wrapped INSIDE that PGP would be the ideal alternative.&nbsp; Does such a thing exist?<br /><br />If not, there&#039;s a definite hole in the market for that right now, lol!

				We can get into this security circlejerk all day and night but the reality is that p2p encryption is what will keep you safe. Your keys protecting your content. Regardless of the media on which they are stored, be it insecure email or whatever, if the content of the message has had it&#039;s encrypted integrity maintained then it should not matter. People choosing to operate their personal data on tormail servers in plaintext should have definitely known the risks of doing so. There is no excuse.<br /><br />When it comes to encryption and security: Your attention to detail and how thorough you are should equal your DESIRE TO STAY OUT OF PRISON.<br /><br />in other words: if you cut corners in securing yourself then you should be willing to accept those risks involved in doing so.<br /><br />In the meantime:<br />Change your virtualbox VM&#039;s over to linux if you haven&#039;t now.

It is advisable that anyone creating a new pair of keys choose a key strength of 4096 bits instead of 2048. This will allow you many extra years past the current prediction of 2033 for a 2048 bit RSA key before the need to create a new, stronger key becomes a necessity. Basically, when creating a new pair of keys, choose the strongest option available to you which is for most software, 4096 bits. Some software will allow you to create larger keys but a 4096 bit key is strong enough for the time being.&nbsp; &nbsp;
