				Silk Road&#039;s Multiple Choice Test to test your asshole-ness level<br />=============================================<br /><br />TRADING ETIQUETTE<br /><br />1) If you don&#039;t receive the package in the expected timeframe<br />a) Bitch your seller to no end through PM.<br />b) Threaten the seller by mounting a FUD propaganda campaign. Yeah, lets destroy this mofo&#039;s reputation.<br />c) Ask politely what happened with the shipment.<br />d) Kill yourself<br /><br />2) If your product is not satisfying you<br />a) Threaten your seller on going fullblown FUD. KILL THE MOFO! FUCKING KILL HIM!<br />b) Ask for a refund IMMEDIATELY!<br />c) Tell politely about the problems to your seller, take a pic of the product as proof of the problem, and ask for a reshipment/replacement.<br />d) Kill yourself<br /><br />3) If the seller is offering customer service<br />a) Nag him endlessly with questions and request for favors that are clearly out of the scope of the support, after all he is the idiot who offered help.<br />b) Write a whole essay whining about how miserable and pathetic life you have, a single paragraph with 1500 words without spaces, asking for a discount.<br />c) Ask concise questions and go straight to the point. Use fucking paragraphs, and use proper fucking grammar.<br />d) Kill yourself.<br /><br />4) If the seller is asking to READ the fucking instructions in the offer page:<br />a) PM him asking him for the instructions.<br />b) Ask &quot;how much is it&quot;<br />c) Go to the offer page and read the fucking instructions<br />d) Kill yourself<br /><br />5) If the seller is selling more than 5 different products<br />a) Ask him ambiguous non-specific questions such as &quot;is it useful&quot;?<br />b) Ask a specific and concise question such as &quot;is the product XXX offered in the link http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/LinkOfxxx useful for my needs which are xyz?&quot;<br />c) Ask &quot;how much is it&quot;<br />d) Kill yourself.<br /><br />6) If the seller only accepts bitcoins<br />a) Ask if he accepts Paypal, Moneypak, Liberty Reserve or any other.<br />b) Don&#039;t ask the stupid questions.<br />c) Ask him if he accepts cash. Yeah, lets meet in person!<br />d) Kill yourself.<br /><br />7) If you are living with your parents<br />a) Ship it to your parent&#039;s place under a fake name<br />b) Ship it under your name<br />c) Ship it to an empty house for sale in the neighborhood<br />d) Ship it to your ass.<br /><br />ENCRYPTION<br /><br />8) If you have a question that is non-critical and non-sensitive (it doesn&#039;t expose your privacy, nor it doesn&#039;t require confidentiality, such as &quot;how much is it&quot;)<br />a) Encrypt it with GPG with a 4096-bit key.<br />b) Send it in plain text.<br /><br />9) If you have a sensitive information to send<br />a) Encrypt it ONLY with your own gpg public key.<br />b) Encrypt it with the recipient&#039;s public key.<br /><br />Answers:<br />1) C (or D)<br />2) C (or D)<br />3) C (or D)<br />4) C (or D)<br />5) B (or D)<br />6) B (or D)<br />7) B (or D)<br />8) B (or D)<br />9) B (or D)<br /><br />The rules are simple, if you go all the way neurotic, you&#039;ll be blacklisted for being a fucking brat or a crazy bitch.<br />Be polite and reasonable. If something is wrong, let us know and we will either reship it after evaluating the legitimacy of your claim.<br />Asking straight for a refund is a strong sign of a scam, and you will be suspected immediately.<br /><br />If the seller&#039;s offer of a reshipment is rejected by the buyer, you will be confirming yourself as a scammer.<br />Every annoying user is blacklisted by the vendors.<br /><br />By dealing in SR you MUST know that every question related to either meeting in person, using paypal, bank transfer or sending cash are prohibited activities since these are all traceable, and defeats the very purpose of the existence of SR.<br />Any attempt of requesting these &quot;favors&quot; will IMMEDIATELY blacklist you as an attempt of a sting operation.<br />The same with the file formats doc, docx, pdf, psd, swf and any link you might send us (excepting privnote) is ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED.<br />If I ask you a picture, please for God&#039;s fucking sake, don&#039;t send it in a pdf. If I ask your personal data, don&#039;t fucking send it in a doc.<br />You will immediately be tagged as cops.<br /><br />For images ONLY USE JPEG or PNG.<br />For information ONLY USE TXT. PERIOD.<br /><br />The shipments MUST NOT be addressed to:<br />1) Empty houses in the market for sale (especially when there is a &quot;sale&quot; sign in the front)<br />2) Abandoned houses.<br />And NEVER under a -blatant- fake name. The mailman is not stupid, they have to walk your block every fucking single day, they must even dream with your fucking street.<br />Do you think they will be as stupid as leaving a box in a house they KNOW it&#039;s been fucking empty for decades?<br /><br />Also there is a guideline in the USPS where they must always check if there is a authorized USPS mailbox and if the name in the mailbox corresponds with the recipient&#039;s name. Most mailmen don&#039;t give a shit, but some do. But also most have a developed six sense when something seems to be out of place, this sixth sense is nurtured from habit.<br />If they leave a note asking to pick it up at the post office, you&#039;ll know that he used his own judgement and decided to not leave the package at your assigned drop.<br /><br />IF you are living with someone else (especially with your parents), be fucking sure they are not nosy.<br />I had more than one case where their nosy parents opened my customer&#039;s envelope and threw away the DL.<br />Another case my customer&#039;s sibling &quot;borrowed&quot; the DL to use it himself without telling his brother about the receipt of the package.<br />So before bitching, check your fucking facts.<br /><br />If you use encryption, please learn to use it.<br />Encryption was made for sensitive information, let me break down what is sensitive:<br />1) Personal Information: Your real name, Your address, Your day of birth, etc...<br />2) Things/pictures/data/plans that would incriminate you.<br />3) Things/pictures/data/plans that would identify you.<br />That&#039;s it.<br />Asking the price, or making a very vague question about what is my product good for DOES NOT REQUIRE ENCRYPTION, in fact I will hate you very much if you make a whole military grade 4096 bit encryption of a message that only says &quot;how much is it? I am interested&quot;.<br /><br />Also, be fucking smart, think twice when you are threatening your vendors.<br />We are vendors in SR for a reason and most of us are extremely resourceful and talented at what we do.<br />It is definitely not a good idea to be spitting upwards, it will definitely drop back at your face.<br />Before bitching, ask politely and listen. If you behave like a brat, you&#039;ll not get shit.

				Thanks Peach, this brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />I try to be welcoming to newer users to Silk Road but it does surprise me the number of people who are able to operate the Tor browser, then ask to order Bitcoins using Paypal/Western Union/Ukash etc. - If these methods were anonymous, the vendors on here would accept them after all!<br /><br />I suppose my own main source of frustration is potential customers who ask questions which are covered in my FAQ - I believe the exact wording is &quot;Full terms, details and FAQ&#039;s available at : ...&quot; and then I provide the link which answers around nine out of ten questions I receive. <br /><br />Still, it&#039;s a living and I think it&#039;s important to show willing to get customers :-) - If any newer users are reading this, please don&#039;t be scared to ask about anything you don&#039;t understand, that&#039;s not why I&#039;m ranting!<br /><br />V.

No pictures, gtfo.<br /><br />Btw, I guess when they receive a defective product that you can tell visually that it is blatantly wrong, you could submit a picture as proof if that is applicable in your situation.<br />The point is, be open to dialogue and go great lengths to discuss about it as a mature boy.<br />Don&#039;t complain, harass and throw threats bitching like a brat, at least not as your first option.<br />Crying may have worked with your poor mothers, here in SR you&#039;ll be blacklisted as a motherfucking asshole.

				randomOVDB#2 is correct about encryption.<br /><br />You fellows are thinking of encryption in the sense of &#039;your encryption&#039; strength being strong enough to protect you. That&#039;s a factor, yes, if the adversary cannot break your encryption they can&#039;t read the message.<br /><br />But look at the bigger picture. What if the enemy does have power to break your message? Then the only thing that protects you is the sheer volume of messages. If all messages contain &quot;goodies&quot;, then the enemy has an incentive to throw resources at you.<br /><br />If the enemy knows that many of the messages will be non-actionable intelligence, then they are greatly deterred from targeting you as a result.<br /><br />Remember, eventually most 2048 bit PGP encrypted messages (most PGP public keys I have in the GPA are 2048 bit) could be decrypted with relative ease in 20-30 years time. In fact those are probably crackable today if you were interesting enough to a powerful organization like the American&#039;s NSA or Russian&#039;s GRU. The question then becomes whether it is *economical* to do so. If some messages are actionable, and others are junk, then LEA&#039;s job becomes a nightmare. If they are all goodies, then it could become an intelligence goldmine instead.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> The literal definition of anonymity is a state of namelessness. A more technical definition of anonymity is the state of being indistinguishable from a given set size. As an example, imagine a closed communication interface with several hundred members. If all of the members use the name &#039;anonymous&#039; to make their posts, they are indistinguishable from each other based on naming information (however, they may not be anonymous based off IP information). However, they are not indistinguishable from those who are not a part of the system. If two people have access to an anonymous suggestion box, any suggestion in the box may be anonymous but the set size is two. The higher your set size is, the more anonymous you are. Anonymity networks attempt to create a substantial set size for your Internet communications. A user of a given anonymity network can generally be narrowed down to the set size of all users of the network (however, it may be difficult for an attacker to determine all users of a given network), but the network attempts to make it difficult for an attacker to narrow the source of a given communication to an individual who put the communication into the network. Thus, the network attempts to give its users a set size larger than one, hopefully large enough to prevent actionable intelligence.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-- Project PolyFront<br />&nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anonymity and encryption can be symbiotic, but in both cases the odds are considerably improved by increasing the set size. Increase the set size by encrypting everything possible, increase the entire community&#039;s security level and most especially your own. You become &quot;hard&quot; nut to crack in the eyes of a LEA.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Some of you say it is uneconomical in terms of time as a vendor&nbsp; to encrypt everything. I am very familiar with the experience of dealing with many encrypted messages at once. I also know that if I concentrate I can clear my inbox in a much shorter period of time than if I dilly dally, there are techniques for speeding up your efficiency here that ought to be familiar to any secretary in the world. I&#039;m not accusing anybody here of being lazy, but perhaps I am accusing you of being a bit inefficient than you ought to be.<br /><br />For one thing, if you don&#039;t type &gt; 50 wpm with close to 100% accuracy, you should think about enrolling in a typing course online or at a business course offered in your community to increase your typing speed. This will pay dividends over time which makes the opportunity costs more than a good investment. Vendors that respond promptly snatch much business from slower vendors.<br /><br />Secondly, if this does not solve the issue for you as a vendor, then the chances are that your operation is expanding rapidly and this time constraint you&#039;re running up against implies you ought to be making new hires to expand your business. Ideally a relative or very trustworthy friend of similar ethic origin i.e. deeper than usual ties, who is in a different time zone in order to maximize the advantages. A so called &#039;tag team&#039; is an extremely good idea on a multitude of levels when it comes to geographical arbitrage in our markets. Even within the States you can at least double your total ROI this way. e.g. 1 in NY, another in Cali. Anyway, back to main point:<br /><br />I get up to 50+ encrypted messages per 24 hour cycle, at a minimum. It is easy to decrypt them all at once by invoking a simple command line argument. It takes less than 60 minutes to respond to them because I employ a division of labor policy with my messages. I adopt generic messaging or templates appropriate for standard situations, which accounts for 90% of the mail anybody here receives, most especially if you are a vendor. I can then contextualize those generic emails very quickly by appending answers to unique questions as part of the generic template.<br /><br />Work smart, not hard. That is what I&#039;m trying to say here, because you can make a lot of work for yourself as a vendor if you don&#039;t employ a wildcard while decrypting messages or you are a slow typist.<br />

				Encrypting your messages reinforces paranoid behavior. Fear and paranoia disrupt the part of the brain responsible for logic.

In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.

But I still concur with Lim. You&#039;re either a naive vendor or a severely unimaginative troll. Some of the people on the Farmer&#039;s Market had the same worldview as yourself, now they are in prison. <br /><br />Paranoia is like any other human emotion, there is a optimum that changes from person to person and circumstance to circumstance. You are breaking the law and therefore you are a criminal. This means law enforcement organizations are trying to shut you down. This means paranoia is part of your job description. It is true that irrational paranoia is destructive, but the cause of our paranoia is very real. You are experiencing extreme cognitive dissonance because it is easier to dismiss reality than to deal with what it is. Kmfkewn has frequently noticed this quality in bottom tier dealers because it is the number 1 contributor to their arrest.<br /><br />If you are quite so sure nobody is out to get you then I&#039;m not sure why you aren&#039;t leaving your real name, telephone number, social security number and place of residence in a post so buyers can contact you effortlessly.<br /><br />I am quite sure nothing I can say will change your mental attitude, particularly given your predisposition to ad hominems, so this is the last reply I shall make to you.

				Hey Pine did you grow up in a big mansion? Was your daddy really rich? And did he spoil you?<br /><br />Why do these rich kids feel that they deserve to be leaders without putting in the work? Why do they want everybody else to do all the labor while they reap the rewards? I think it is because they grow up with a sense of entitlement. I think that is what you are Pine.

				Don&#039;t ask stupid questions? Well I was always told that there was no such thing as a stupid question, certainly got me through my years of service in the British Army. <br /><br />Even if someone has stated &quot;only ship to US&quot;, I weigh up the vendor (new/ needs reviews/ etc) and ask. Sometimes I even ask anyway but if it looks like they&#039;ve got a good, regular source of customers then I won&#039;t bother. It doesn&#039;t hurt to ask if you do it the right way, especially if you&#039;ve got the good buying stats from the start. <br /><br />---<br /><br />Encrypting everything isn&#039;t right - whilst yes it&#039;d be nice if you could have everything encrypted and getting into that habit - will ALL vendors appreciate this? <br />The best way is to encrypt as much as possible - perhaps after asking the seller if that sort of communication is okay. You should be looking to encrypt anything that relates to an order, potential order or any personal details. <br /><br />Stay safe kiddies, remember you are most likely breaking some law(s) - so it pays to be safe rather than sorry. Always use common sense and always approach with caution until you&#039;ve established a good, working relationship with someone.
