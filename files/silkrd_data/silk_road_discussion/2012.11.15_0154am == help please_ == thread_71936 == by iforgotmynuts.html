				You spammed this on other boards.. not really going to endear you to the SR community. When we do lend, it tends to be to people who&#039;ve at least spent some time here.

				If you aren&#039;t able to get that bitcoin now you shouldn&#039;t be using it. Just like gambling. Don&#039;t bet what you can&#039;t lose.

Really, your only forum posts are begging for money and you wonder why you&#039;re not getting a warm reception. If you need more bitcoins, wait 24 hours and see if the price bounces up. When you have enough, buy immediately. DO NOT ASK FOR MONEY.

				thank you all, somebody took me up on my offer. i no longer need the btc<br /><br /><br />and im not &quot;begging&quot; for money , i clearly said if nobody wants to loan me the btc and make .4 in interest, that its no skin off my back. <br /><br /><br />nice to know we have a pretty welcoming group of people in this community though :) thanks to those who were helpful .

				Sorry if this comes off rude, but I&#039;m really curious:<br /><br />whoever was sweet enough to lend the btc, could you let us know if iforgotmynuts ever pays you back?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;d probably not have such a mean disposition towards newbies asking for money if I saw someone like this honoring the loan just once.
