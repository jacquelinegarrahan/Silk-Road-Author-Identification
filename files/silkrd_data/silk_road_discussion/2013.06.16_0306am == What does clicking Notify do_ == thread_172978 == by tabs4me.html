				Notify just emails you if someone posted in said thread. It doesn&#039;t work because when you signed up for a forum account you didn&#039;t enter a real email address (I hope!)

				Right it doesn&#039;t work to e-mail notifications. You could have used a valid e-mail address at signup such as @tormail.org. My guess is it doesn&#039;t work because it is not safe for SR nor the forums to send e-mail messages. Somewhere in the e-mail process a valid IP address would have to show up to make it out to the clearnet, if for no other reason than some server has to connect to the delivery address mail server to deliver the message. And that seems like it would be highly risky.

				People &#039;subscribing&#039; to a thread are commenting in it so the thread appears when they click &quot;show new replies to your posts.&quot; This is at the top left of your screen, underneath &quot;Hello [your username]&quot;. It&#039;s a very handy feature, but one thing I have yet to figure out after months of posting- how the hell does one unsubscribe?!

				You guys are silly. That&#039;s not how I use &#039;Notify&#039; anyway. <br /><br />Profile&gt;Modify Profile&gt;Notifications<br /><br />If I&#039;m supposed to leave a review for somebody or a thread has info I want for later, I click notify in the thread so I can easily get back to it when I need to.
