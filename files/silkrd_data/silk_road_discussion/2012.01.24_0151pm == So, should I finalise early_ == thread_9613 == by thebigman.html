				Question for vendors really, but all opinions welcome.<br /><br />The situation is I have a small order (&lt;5btc) which has been &#039;in transit&#039; for 4 business days after being &#039;processing&#039; for 2 days prior. Vendor is top-5, in the same location as me and so if it had been posted I would assume 1-2 business days to arrive. <br /><br />I have a perfect transaction history showing &gt;12 transactions over 6-month period, including 2 previous transactions with the seller albeit 5 months ago.<br /><br />So if any vendors are reading this - do I sound like a &#039;finalise early&#039; buyer to you? Would you expect me to finalise early?<br /><br />Basically I am tempted to finalise early just to get the wheels turning, though of course I know I run the risk of it being a no-show especially if it&#039;s already been posted. I have sent a msg to the vendor asking him to clarify if he is waiting for me to finalise, no response as yet.<br /><br /><br /><br />(And just to clarify, this is no big deal to me because I know the vendor is legit, the amount is petty and I am not desperately waiting for the item to arrive. I won&#039;t reveal the vendor&#039;s name because there is no need.)

				I like to just use the system as it is intended. If you finalise early then you&#039;ll have no recourse if anything goes wrong. The whole trend of finalising early is strange to me.

				Why are you even asking this?<br />Your package is marked as in transit, which means that it has been dispatched. I fail to see how finalising early would speed up the postal system. Maybe its just me...

				Thanks for the responses.<br /><br />I agree with you both. The reason I am asking is because it seems the package may not have been sent - it seems the seller may be waiting for early finalisation.<br /><br />I base this assumption on the fact it has been in transit for double the amount of time I would expect a normal delivery in my region to take, and on the fact the seller asks for early finalisation for new buyers.<br /><br />My question really was do you think I count as a &#039;new buyer&#039;, or one who would normally warrant an expectation to finalise early.

				Indeed, thank you Rusty.<br /><br />However the predicament that I am in is that the package may be sitting in the sellers house with my address printed on the front, and he is waiting for me to finalise before sending it out. This may be because he considers me a risky proposition for some reason, possibly that I don&#039;t have enough purchases, and that he has no doubt forgotten about and destroyed the evidence of the 2 successful transactions we had 5 months ago and thus considers me a &#039;new buyer&#039;.<br /><br />Until he sends me a response to my msg, I am idly posting to the forum to see what others would do! <br /><br />

				Well this sounds like a predicament as you say! In my experience some top ranked vendors don&#039;t respond to messages quickly, presumably because they&#039;re busy with their normal lives and their orders.<br /><br />Which means your package as you say may sit there in the seller&#039;s house with your address on it, waiting until the seller gets round to reading your message, which may not be today, tomorrow or the next day.<br /><br />Good luck mate!

				I think these vendors have us noobs by the balls. We want their product so they make us finalize early if we don;t have the stats their looking for. I ran across a new vendor today who has the nerve to say if you have&#039;nt had 3 successful purchased with him previously then you need 16 transactions with 10% refund rate. How can us noobs get their if no one is willing to give us a chance. Who wants to waste time and money on small purchases just to fatten someone pocket before he can sell you something larger than an 1/8.

				You need to PM with the Vendor.&nbsp; The vendor needs to tell you if he needs/wants an early finalization, <br /><br />If the vendor is not responding, you should cancel the order and get it from someone else.<br /><br />Finalizing early with no communication from the vendor is just asking for more frustration.<br /><br />

				No, I can understand why a vendor would want people to finalize early. It&#039;s important to them that they don&#039;t get scammed, and finalizing early protects them from scams with new buyers. Buyers have to work their way up to making purchases; they can&#039;t get trust out of nowhere.

				I don&#039;t ask anyone to finalize early as per my policy - its right on my SR profile.<br />I accept orders from first timers all the time although they are generally limited to 1/4&#039;s or half&#039;s.<br />If someone tries to order from me that sketches me out by having a &gt; 5% return rate <br />I drop the order like a hot potato &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; click&nbsp; -&nbsp; oops....... there goes the cancel button!!!&nbsp; lol

				I&#039;ve had to finalize early on every single one of my transactions thus far (11).&nbsp; This is due to me only wanting MDMA at the moment and every MDMA vendor requires it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only lost one order so far (still waiting on resolution).<br /><br />I will say that every one of them has sent me a message asking for EF.&nbsp; If your vendor hasn&#039;t even asked you for it, I don&#039;t see any reason to do it.

				Thanks SmCoop. I have never finalised early, so it is good to know that you&#039;re usually asked to do it, rather than it just being required automatically.

				I would NEVER finalise early. Ever. I noticed Swazibudbud says you have to finalise early to get his product, it put me off using him. I use SR for the security it gives me. I know im an honest buyer, my rating shows that too. I find it odd that people so willingly finalise early.

				Maybe it&#039;s just me, but it seems like if a vendor pays $25 for a product from a cook, sells it for $50, and then gets scammed...&nbsp; Escrow resolution gets his investment back anyway, more or less.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see a need to ask buyers to pull down their pants, bend over, and pray they don&#039;t get fucked.<br /><br />Of course, not all vendors are selling at 100% markup, I know, but generally speaking I think the escrow system is fair enough.

				If a seller says you must finalise early to buy from them, bite the bullet and go somewhere else. There is probably a reason why their product is so cheap and they need you to finalise early. Just dont do it. Totally defeats the point of SR!

				Well, it arrived with no need to finalise early and no reply to my msg from the seller.<br /><br />So the moral of this story is definitely not to finalise early unless the seller specifically contacts you to ask you to do so (and then, only do so if you fully understand and accept what you&#039;re risking).<br /><br />And for the record, I agree with all in this thread who say we shouldn&#039;t finalise early at all. The point of all this was just to find out what others would do if they were in the same predicament - the potential that a package could be being held but vendor hasn&#039;t specifically contacted buyer to ask for early finalisation.<br /><br />Also, new buyers should seek out sellers like Christy Nugs for their first transactions... <br /><br />Thanks all. I am now going to sniff a line!
