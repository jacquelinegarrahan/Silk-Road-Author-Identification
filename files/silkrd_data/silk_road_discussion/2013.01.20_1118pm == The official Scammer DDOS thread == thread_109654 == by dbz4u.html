				I kinda felt like this deserved it&#039;s own thread so here goes. Anyone with the technical knowledge to pull of a DDOS on Virwex and bitcointalks.com should post here. I&#039;m talking strategies, logistics and resources. You tell us the community what you need, and of course we will have the more technical members of the community verify any tools that we need to download and from what location we should be getting them if need be. I want this to be as safe as possible for all members involved, and i want to crush this spam with a vengeance. I don&#039;t think we have to worry about LEO even though it is a clearnet site, because they are scammers running an illegitimate business, that doesn&#039;t actually sell anything.<br /><br />Essentially all tools and methods should be sent to the mods and Astor for verification of their usefulness and trustworthiness. Thank you in advance for anyone and everyone that participates

The one case where a botnet could be used for good. I wanted to something like this during a popular game launch that was flooded with gold spammers at launch(take a guess), but i alas i do not have the technical know-how. Like i said, a technically verified tool the community could use against these spammers would be my wet dream if it was in the same vain as the LOIC Anon used, in ease of use i mean.<br /><br />It&#039;s pathetic that all we can do is sit here and let them trash our board which is supposed to be our safe haven of discussion. This is where some of us come to relax, every time i see one of these motherfuckers it&#039;s like listening to a crying baby on an airplane. Stuff like this makes people on other sites change their usernames to &quot;cuntpuncher69&quot;

				And bitcointalks.com is down, for now at least. Gee that was easy.<br /><br />No need for an army of computers, just one small laptop using an exploit in most major servers. To do this download &quot;slowloris.pl&quot; and run:<br /><br />./slowloris -dns http://bitcointalks.com -num 5000<br /><br />I am running this in 3 terminals and it has taken them off the internet.<br /><br />This is tracable, but I am using anonymous proxies.

				If ya guys wants something like this ran 24/7 I would need a pre-paid credit card number to set up a remote server and I would need someone to help me with the phone-back verification. It would cost about $30 a month.<br /><br />Since it is attacking through tor the server we are using is unlikely to ever get shut down.<br /><br />Running it from my own tor connection, I can only run it for a little while as it is resource intensive.

				Guys, we all appreciate the effort and the zeal to get back at these spammers, but I&#039;m not sure DDOS&#039;ing them is going to bring the right kind of attention to SR, or a non-retaliatory reaction from the spammers.&nbsp; For that reason, I can&#039;t sticky the threads.<br /><br />If the other mods or admins have a different opinion, they&#039;re free to sticky the threads if they so choose.

If you know of any other singleman attacks we can run simultaneously please, share them. Obviously we only want to target the spammers here, these tools are not meant to be spread for funsies. This is actual retaliation. As far as i see it these spammers want war, I mean to give it to them.
