				For you kushkush, when you offer samples (ketamine for instance), actually select people and ship it to them. <br /><br />You keep making threads promising sample offers, but instead of actually selecting people willing to sample and review, you post smiley faces to bump your threads in product offers sections. <br /><br />That doesn&#039;t build trust. <br /><br />And so your lotteries look sketchy too. <br /><br />You have to take the chance and send out samples, no gimmicks. If you are afraid that you will be sending out free samples and receive no reviews, check to see if anyone responding to your sample offers is on the reliable reviewer list: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92599.0<br /><br />You can even contact some on that last as ask them if they would like to do a review in exchange for a free sample. <br /><br />That&#039;s how you gain more customers.

				Not to be negative but here is my Honest KUSHKUSH experience:<br /><br />- A few weeks ago I jumped on your sample of fishscale uncut coke. You made a forum posting about it and I was the first one on it.<br />-&nbsp; I Paid for a small sample but I made a wrong shipping choice (whoops, I picked &#039;shared shipping&#039; or something labeled that you labeled wrong ,that I thought it meant that we both shared the shipping cost on the sample, sorry. )&nbsp; I notified you about it and you said I made a wrong choice for shipping and that was it.&nbsp; Left me hanging.<br /><br />No resolution, the order went unfullfilled!!.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had to cancel it after a week of nothing.<br /><br />Dude,&nbsp; you should have: <br />&nbsp; 1.) For a lousy few bucks you could have covered the mistake shipping choice and sent it out anyway.<br /><br />or <br /><br />2.)&nbsp; Offered to cancel the order for me, so I could re-do the order right away instead of letting go into cancel after a few days. . holding up my money and making me wonder what is up. .<br /><br />or <br /><br />3.)&nbsp; Offer to cover the shipping if I buy a full order of a gram or more.&nbsp; That way, you at least get an order and even more money out of me!&nbsp; Why not?<br /><br />I never been back since.&nbsp; I figured you hated me for being a pain and I can&#039;t risk making an order now.<br /><br />Here is my stats, I&#039;m a good customer.&nbsp; I&#039;m loyal to my favorite vendors and I write positive reviews. <br /><br />Total transactions: 17<br />Total spent: $1050.79<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 2 months<br /><br /><br />So, I think you could work on customer support feedback and learn how to make any order (good or bad, mistake or not) into money in your pocket.&nbsp; For god sake, take any order you can get and find a resolution so you can take people&#039;s money and not abandon the order over a few dollars.<br /><br />All this nonsense over a few dollars short on shipping because I made a mistake on my part choosing the wrong shipping option that you labeled in a confusing way.&nbsp; &nbsp;My account always has money in it, ready to spend, but I won&#039;t repeat the same order twice without a resolution.<br /><br />Let me know how I can assist you in being a better vendor.&nbsp; I still would really like to try your uncut coke.&nbsp; I&#039;m scared to order now.&nbsp; Fix me, make me feel as comfortable to order as my favorite vendors do.&nbsp; Treat me with respect and I will keep throwing money at you. . each week on payday, Thursdays- like clockwork.&nbsp; .. simple customer to make happy.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;d like to assist any way I can.&nbsp; Let me know if you want me to delete this post .&nbsp; Just MSG me and its done.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Jediknight is 100% correct you need to treat customers and potential customers here like as if you had normal brick and mortar store.always try to picture yourself on the other side of the deal how&#039;s it feel? the customer is always right.. and your only as good as your last sale. :D . if you have to bend a little do it... I&#039;m not saying being a chump and getting totally shit on but customer service is almost as important as your merchandise

				Yep. And the sample offer threads have been a running joke because you fail to respond to anyone who takes you up on the offer. You even often fail to respond to questions about your sample offers. <br /><br />You display a lack of integrity and seriousness. All of which is easy to fix. <br /><br />Just follow through. Following through goes a long way towards trust.

				Here&#039;s a few ideas: <br /><br />- send out more than a few samples. Don&#039;t think about losing money, think about it in terms of investment. <br />- Even if you have high quality product, start selling cheap, slightly above costing price. Inexpensive product will get you many customers in no time, and once these customers start spreading the word about your high quality AND cheap product, many more customers will come to you. <br />- Keep the prices low and the service impeccable for a while. <br />- Once you have a solid base of customers, start incrementing your prices, LITTLE BY LITTLE. <br /><br />It amazes me how many vendors out there don&#039;t get these simple marketing rules.&nbsp; :)

				What others have said sums it up. You have sample threads that you do not respond to. That sends a red flag to me immediately<br /><br />I PM&#039;ed you several days ago regarding a sample that you did not reply to. I figured oh well I guess he picked other more senior members over me. No biggie, but I have yet to see sample reviews coming in.<br /><br />In my opinion the best 3 routes to go are as follows:<br /><br />1. Offer samples like you have, but actually follow through with them. Cap it at say about 15 members and list their usernames on the thread so that others can you see you have in fact selected members. If your product is quality as you say orders will come in quickly. As a seller on here 15 samples at about 1g each even with shipping should not be too costly<br /><br />2. Without offering samples you could offer a limited amount of special sale prices to members. For instance send an Oz to 5 people at 2BTC off your normal price. If everything goes well you should have 5 good reviews and others will see that and try your product<br /><br />3. Don&#039;t do any special sales etc, but provide prompt delivery times and a good product for the money. It will take you longer to build a base this way, but you have to start somewhere<br /><br />These are just 3 ways to go about it. As a buyer here I look for sample reviews and in my opinion is the #1 way to increase your customer base very quickly.<br /><br />Case in point: NorthWestDirect... offered samples, members received samples and saw NWD had a quality product (I was one of them) Already they are selling out of their strains quickly<br /><br />If you provide in the following areas you will become a top notch seller<br /><br />1.Customer Service<br />2. Price<br />3. Quality for the price<br />4.Processing &amp;Shipping times

				Take a look at Christy Nugs, she has a single thread and people beating down her door for product. Sometimes less is more. I think you&#039;re genuinely enthusiastic and want to be a great vendor, but you might by trying a little too hard and in doing so it makes people doubt. Perhaps stick to a single thread each in Rumors and Product Offers so people know where to find you. That way you&#039;ll build a micro community of clients who will provide legit feedback in a central location. <br /><br />I can&#039;t comment on your service, but I do know that when a vendor does right by me I&#039;m not shy about giving them repeat business and telling others on the forums about a good experience.

				I know for us personally we believe being 100% genuine about product as well as communicating clearly and in a timely fashion is ultimately what a lot of people look for in a vendor and quite frankly every vendor should be able to operate this way. At the end of the day if you are genuine and truthful about your product (Has to be good quality product though for sure) as well as have FAIR prices its only a matter of time. We&#039;ve started a little slower than our liking but things are definitely beginning to pick up mainly due to a growing forum presence, quality product, and most importantly great stealth/ customer service. Try to think towards the long haul, if you plan to be a great, legitimate vendor for the long term everything should work out how you plan.

				The &quot;price to be competitive&quot; option is very difficult on a page that doesn&#039;t all you to sort by price. You can advertise LOW PRICES a lot but most people do not visit the forums.

				COMMUNICATION&nbsp; COMMUTATION and COMMUNICATION&#039;&#039; :)<br /><br />If a vendor does not reply for days or never replies and when they do its some piss poor sentence like &#039;&#039;yes its very good&#039;&#039; then they can fuck right off after I have took the time to ask a number of detailed questions about the product and so forth.<br /><br />Some vendors are really good some need a wake up call, one in particular I wont name names but I wanted an order for an ounce and a half of weed I messaged him and he did not reply and the reason for this no reply is because I was honest in feedback saying his product was not very good and left a full smoke report for 2 of his products one was great and the other rubbish but still left him 5/5 for both whilst other people are sucking his cock and tickling his balls saying &#039;&#039;grade A+++++ weed best in the world I love this seller I want to bend over and let him insert his penis inside me and pay him for the pleasure&#039;. Some buyers on sr need to get a grip before they leave feedback as its confusing enough as it is for the real buyers with out some kid whos buzzing over a gram of average weed leaving over the top incorrect arse licking feedback. Fair enough its easy to get excited but please just be honest. Apologies for the rant I don&#039;t know where that came from lol and actually I might make a thread about this something like &#039; Stop leaving over the top feedback new buyers&#039;<br />
