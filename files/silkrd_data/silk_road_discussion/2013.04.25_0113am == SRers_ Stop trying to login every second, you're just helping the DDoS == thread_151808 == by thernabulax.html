				Unless you&#039;re seriously WDing, you&#039;re just as bad as the DDoS losers! :P<br /><br />If this isn&#039;t a ddos thing, of it&#039;s bigger than it seems (like gov&#039;t involvement in the attack) I take back my snarky remark against all you practically-robotic re-login attempters. I used to be one of them during downtimes.&nbsp; :-\

Thoughts?<br /><br />But to answer the part of the post you didn&#039;t delete. I thought two emoticons would be enough to show this is just meant to lighten the mood in a dark time (that&#039;s hopefully ending soon). The effect of less people trying to log in is miniscule.

				Hey, you sound like you have more brain cells left than I do . . . <br /><br />Can you explain to us &#039;tards why DPR can&#039;t setup a 2nd $2000. Server on another network and mirror the site the same way he&#039;s hosting the main one?&nbsp; Why isn&#039;t there a few server setups in different locations, I mean this shit is cheap to buy really. Remotely virtual hosting, all sorts of ways really. <br /><br />It seems like DPR has just a single server rack with a few boxes.&nbsp; Maybe a high end Cisco router ands aged switches and shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t sound like he has redundancy at all.&nbsp; Lots of IT guys understand redundancy power, networking., storage, etc <br /><br />Can you explain in your opinion?&nbsp; I&#039;m serious.

				In fewer words, there must be a reason DPR chooses to use a simple server setup.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking because some components are mobile, or quick to move locations or something?&nbsp; I mean why not buy a nice 32 U rack and fill it up and light it up with servers and fibre?&nbsp; He&#039;s got the bucks. They&#039;re fun toys anyhow.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dunno.

(Realizing it might have been for Bill Clinton)<br /><br />My best 3 guesses:<br /><br />1.) SR functionality seems to be too low a priority, lots of reasons why this could be so... DPR is drained from all the responsibility heaped on him, lost interest despite his/their profits, he&#039;s more into other projects, he invested in something and doesn&#039;t have to worry about money for life but still feels obligated to SR and wants control.<br /><br />2.) Based on posts read here and there, DPR might be our Jesus figure, but he isn&#039;t a techie, and most of the time is as clueless as we are just waiting for updates from his people.<br /><br />3.) DPR and SR is limited compared to mainstream.com sites in how they can reach out for help, hence longer downtimes.
