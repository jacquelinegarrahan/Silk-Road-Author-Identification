				There have been many reports in the last few weeks on bitcointalk and these forums of people not receiving their money or BTC on Bitinstant. A quick search for the term on either will bring up some of the posts.<br /><br />I&#039;d use another exchange.

				I used them last week. Took much longer than I was comfortable with but nonetheless I got my BTC. I&#039;d like to find a market that doesnt take such a high fee for direct to wallet. Anyone try Bitcopia??<br /><br />Everyone is in a panic about prices dropping. I think buying while they are low is a good idea. I wonder what the botton will be?

				Here&#039;s a thread where someone had a bad experience: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108920.0;topicseen<br /><br />Others posted in the thread, though, saying it worked fine. So I guess YMMV.

				Yea i read some post about ppls loosing money.. I just wanted to know if it had happen recently.. Thats my only way of getting coins, the place i deposite cash is only 5 min from me. <br /><br />I cant seem to find any other exchange with any of the banks they use near me. Im from pretty&nbsp; much a small town and only a few banks here, and the major ones are almmost a Hour away. <br /><br />Iv got plans to put a large sum on here from my taxes through bitinstant. but i think i will try out small first and just keep reloading small amounts til im loading up to where i wanna be.<br /><br />iF any of you know of any other plce like bitinstant that can send direct to address and dont have to use a bank please tell me..Its worked great 9mnths for me here.. I hope it doesnt fall off..<br /><br />And i think the biotcoin fall is a good thing as well like someone else said, because we all know they we rise again at some time. I was buying them when they were 5 and 12 bucks. I spent 200 when they were 12 each and got locked up a cple mnths came back and had a nice chunk of money in my account.. <br /><br />aNYWway we will all make it, weve been here this long, we wont be stopped now..

				I bought some coins yesterday through Bitinstant and it worked, but there was about a 4-5 hour delay before the coins showed up. Coincidentally or not, that meant I got the price just as it hit a local high ($120), so I got screwed. That&#039;s the last time I use Bitinstant to actually buy coins. Next time I&#039;m transferring cash to Gox or BTC-e and be able to pull the buy trigger when *I* decide it&#039;s the best time.

				bitinstant to mt.gox can be sketchy at times. i&#039;ve ran into problems where my money wasn&#039;t showing up in mt.gox but for some reason it showed up in an mt.gox redeemable coupon that was no where for me to find it at without support telling me i had a coupon..

				Well, I&#039;m still waiting after 16 days for my funds. I could link you to a forum I&#039;m involved in where there are over 250 pages in one thread from people like me who have to chase our money. We&#039;re all going back and forth, over and over with the forum BI support rep. Some people have gotten their money and it does appear that finally people are getting their coins. It&#039;s sad though that people who had lost their deposits only 2 days ago got resolution, while I&#039;ve been waiting over 2 weeks. You&#039;ll be taking your chances with BI right now, but it does appear new transactions are going through. But be warned, they may just choose to hold your money to pay people like me who have been waiting forever, with MINIMAL support response. Good luck

				I would advise against it.&nbsp; I made an order for cash to bitcoin address that did not go through.&nbsp; I contacted support hours later and they credited my account for a fraction of the proper amount.&nbsp; I was sent less than half the correct amount of bitcoins, an amount far less than any of the market rates for the entire day.&nbsp; I am still in the process of getting that sorted out.<br /><br />It may work better for going directly to MtGox.&nbsp; I dont have that.&nbsp; My preferred method is to bitinstant to bitstamp, which has never failed.&nbsp; However that option is still not available.

				I awoke this morning to find that BI has finally processed my funds . I&#039;m a little disappointed that I was still charged BI fees and that I know have to pay $100 per btc rather than the $85 it was if my deposit had been processed correctly. Oh well, I&#039;m happy to finally have my money. <br />&nbsp; To anyone with bitinstant trouble, follow this thread:&nbsp; &nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.5400<br /><br />&nbsp;Thank you to the SR forum member who pointed me to it. Not sure if I&#039;d have gotten my money back without you. New deposits with BI appear to currently have about a %25 chance of failure, according to their support rep.

				Still 25% is not acceptable in my eyes// We are demanding millions of dollars worth of business from this company. U would think with all the capital they have made ,they could put together and system that is full proof better than a u may or may not get..Or its possible there is a chance you could loose your money.. Thats bullshjit if u ask me..<br /><br /><br />If it wernt for us there would b e no bitinstant, And i find another site like bitinstant with the bitcoin to address options with out having to use&nbsp; a major bank or use a ID and all im stuck with bitinstant, I guess i could use Sugar moma on here or one of the other btc vendors, but i always felt they charged waaay to much interest..<br /><br />Im gonna check out the site someone mention in a few posts back that said no banks needed..<br /><br />For those of us use to bitinstant lets hope they get their shit fully together.. I have never had a issue and never waited longer than a full hour, BUT iv been away from the SR forr a month or two and coins are going nuts as well as the coin dealers.. <br /><br />I think SR should offer another payment options since bitcoins cant get their shit right, well the sellers its not the coins. Do u all think like Buying prepaid cards or money packs and paying straight to your account would be a good option?&nbsp; Allot of changes would have to be done to have that option but i think it would be great for us members.. Buy money packs come home get on the site go to your account load the card to a set up like prepaid card system but built into sr...<br /><br />I dunno sounds good when i think of it..
