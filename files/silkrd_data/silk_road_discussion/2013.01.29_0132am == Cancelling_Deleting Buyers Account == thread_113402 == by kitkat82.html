				I am seriously considering deleting my buyer&#039;s account (personal reasons)...and am unable to log into SR right now to check and see what the process is.<br /><br />Will it just have to stay there, or can I actually completely erase it?

				They used to delete accounts if you didn&#039;t log in for some time (I&#039;ve heard different numbers, but it was around 5-6 months). I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s the case anymore.

				I actually remember someone starting a thread on this maybe last month, and I think the consensus was that there is no way to wholly delete the buyers account at all, or you had to get a site admin&#039;s attention. I could be totally wrong, but I think that&#039;s what I remember?

				If you can&#039;t delete an account - then you sabatoge it!&nbsp; &nbsp;Fill in the details with fake info.<br />This way, if someone does come across it they will know its been faked and disregard it.<br /><br />You could also setup your worst enemy with their personal details in there.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to delete anything, just make it useless by editing whats there......
