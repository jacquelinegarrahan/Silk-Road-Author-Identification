				Hmmm, that was AWFUL quick considering Silk Road took six months to design before it was implemented.<br /><br />Also, I see you&#039;ve posted that link on clearnet. Hope you did it through tor. Wouldn&#039;t call you the smartest if you did a DPR and posted information on buying illegal drugs on clearnet.<br /><br />Still, good luck. The more of these websites the better. Even if they might be shit.

				Well all i see is front end... if people understand how the web works, front end is nothing. what matters is the backend, so how is that progressing? this is the part that will take months to develop even with a bunch of very good developers so id like to see how far you have came. I am not saying you have not made great progress, just a question. Also if you are using a CMS expect to have everything taken down in days, but i&#039;m sure you are not using one, or so i hope. But good job, I wish i had more time to help out.

				i miss the reason of why a new silk road is needed ?&nbsp; , SR was SR and now it&#039;s gone , stop . His name was so famous enough to attract many people every day&nbsp; because was innovative , the first succeded experiment ,and media talked a lot about him. Now there is BMR and SM that do his job well like the dear SR , a new version of the site expecially with a new name is fated to fail , or to became a 3rd part marketplace after BMR and SM , realize the fact that show must go on , with new players.
