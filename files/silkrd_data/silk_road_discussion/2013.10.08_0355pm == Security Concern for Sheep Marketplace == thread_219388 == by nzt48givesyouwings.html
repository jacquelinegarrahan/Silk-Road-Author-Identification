				http://www.reddit.com/r/SheepMarketplace/comments/1nsmzx/a_friendly_warning_sheepmarketplacecoms_owner/<br /><br />Seems as if the site&#039;s owner hasn&#039;t taken basic precautions for protecting the site. Buyers/vendors beware.

				This is bad. After reading the entire reddit thread I&#039;m of the opinion that there is most likely a connection between the two websites. If you go to sheepmarketplace.com you will see the message &quot;Ucet byl zablokovan protoze porusoval provozni rad&quot;, I saw this exact message when visiting http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion earlier today. There has to be a connection. So long as people FE, encrypt their messages and pull out of escrow any damage could be mitigated. I just hope some of the SR admins pull together and bring out a secure and trusted alternative before too many vendors get burnt by any scam/honeypot/poor opsec sites that spring up over the next weeks/months.

				With everything going on with FED and site shut downs, I&#039;m shocked people trust Sheep seeing how its so new, seems to have popped&nbsp; up out of know where around the same time as SR shut down, plus, who wants to be labeled a SHEEP??&nbsp; Even the name sounds like a honey pot.

				I do agree that the name &#039;Sheep&#039; is a bit strange but having placed an order with a trusted vendor all went well. But as far as I am aware (please correct me if I am wrong) the site has been around for quite some time. I have seen vendor accounts that have been active for 8 months. It seems that it just wasn&#039;t used by many until the shutdown took place. I just cannot bare to use BMR. The interface is terrible, but i have no doubt in the coming weeks the site will be updated a lot. It is unbelievable how many new listings are going up a day on Sheep. It has almost trebled since SR shut down. Be interesting to see what happens in the near future.

				think SM is about that 8 months of age, tops. started early this year anyway. <br /><br />that reddit piece would be a recommended read to almost anyone who panicked after SR went down and is now either desperate to sell or score. maybe take a breath and think for a while. <br /><br />less than 500 listings of drugs 1 week ago, last I got in was it over 2500 already (been a dead site to me for 2+ hrs now)... whoever gets % off it, must be one happy person - and on a number of shitlists among the agencies with 3, sigh, sometimes even 4 letter, names. <br /><br />think WWGSD - what would grandpa simpson do?
