				As topic. Got a message 9 hrs ago from &quot;Do not reply&quot;. Title is &quot;Checking in&quot;, and when I clicked on it, I got logged out. If it&#039;s no problem, it&#039;s no problem. Just wanted to make sure that it&#039;s nothing serious. Looks a little suspicious. Anyone knows what it is and why it was sent?

				Libertas and ChemCat beat me to it! <br /><br />That&#039;s exactly what it was, and just so you know, here&#039;s what they look like;<br /><br />One or more of your shipments have not been confirmed in over 10 days . Please finalize any shipments that have arrived, or click &quot;resolve&quot; next to the ones that have not arrived. If you do nothing, your payment will be released to your vendor 17 days after your order was shipped.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road staff<br /><br />NOTE: This is an automated message. Replies will not be answered.<br /><br />********************************************************************************************************<br /><br />It&#039;s just a friendly reminder to keep an eye on that &quot;auto-finalize&quot; date, as some orders do take longer than others, and if it&#039;s late, you usually want to extend the due date or auto finalize date by at least 3-5 days, and then contact the seller to advise them. Even though they&#039;ll see it if they look, they&#039;re usually busy with other tasks, and look at that information last. <br /><br />So it&#039;s not unusual, in fact it&#039;s very common, especially w/international orders. <br /><br />You&#039;ll get used to them. -- Think of it as a courtesy call.<br /><br />Peace 8)<br /><br />jagfug
