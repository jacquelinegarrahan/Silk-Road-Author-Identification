				UPDATE (07/02/2013 1700 UTC): Forgot to mention another change that&#039;s coming with this update.&nbsp; Now that MtGox is losing market share, we&#039;ll be pulling from multiple markets to get the &quot;official&quot; exchange rate for pricing and hedging.&nbsp; It will also be more closely weighted to the preset instead of equally weighting all prices over the past 24-hours.&nbsp; This part is a bit of an experiment and we may revert back if there are any problems with it.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />This coming Tuesday we&#039;ll be rolling out some changes that should be welcome to our members who are used to using currencies other than the US Dollar.&nbsp; Support for 34 new fiat currencies plus gold and silver will be added.&nbsp; You will be able to view the prices in the market along with your account balance in these currencies, and vendors will be able to peg their prices to these currencies as well.<br /><br />So for example, if you live in Australia and view prices in the Aussie Dollar, and you shop with domestic suppliers who peg their prices to the Aussie Dollar, you will see more or less steady prices across the market even as the exchange rates fluctuate.<br /><br />As an added bonus, we&#039;ve added 2 decimal places to Bitcoin prices for a total of 4.&nbsp; This can easily be expanded or contracted as necessary if the Bitcoin exchange rate changes dramatically in the future.<br /><br />The site will be taken offline around 1900 UTC on July 2nd while the update is deployed and tested.&nbsp; We&#039;ve done our best to catch any bugs that might crop up, but please message support with any that you find asap when we come back online.<br /><br />In case it is asked, hedging is completely unaffected by this.&nbsp; The only options are still Bitcoins and US Dollars.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJRz8LwAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olw6QH/1tNNOF8b+CgaJD7aAgc++zo<br />KumwoQvO+cbCA9pF0OWJ3x1M1j1DmRoX+9uzIiDsCjNOmQHOFiEnPTXGBqwoSGU5<br />Nst7kWiS6tfYY3+da+D48Hl8LF4FJHwcTS/DB0oZ3ugIXWAHAZVS5uFWkJZRcf0s<br />BWP+VNN2f1gIabLTEVOU1vVaTAjgB9u+8GymhZCeF4yLN4lgW9K9WPm7xP+XlMIH<br />JLwk78PJH9nQ/0V8h0Oqea/NkYpjcPFRP3bLUh+vfJJeZCsEA6OMyi4a5UXpowQi<br />Zbdtcrv4hF1WGv8YtaU/FrkJIOMFZnN7dhWZ0wUBpQPpJUVw7cOtDiVXpA1In0s=<br />=jjrx<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

				This will change the world. <br /><br />I have held this belief since I first discovered for myself that silk Road and the darknet where not just urban myth. <br /><br />This added functionality, as well as the rising popularity, in my humble opinion, will change the economic landscape of the planet.<br /><br />This will force some changes in regards to worldwide view on drugs and global economy.<br /><br />I have faith.

Honestly with mods seemingly vanishing, n$a topics disappearing and vendors going the same route, and DPR spewing new topics like never before (w/o his pgp key) - I smelled a honeypot. with that said its comforting to me to see improvements made to the site that seem to strengthen the system as a whole and alleviate many of my concerns. good move dpr.

				Hey guys,<br /><br />Some interesting updates here. Good work. GE wishes you all the best. Hope it all goes smoothly!<br /><br />I did notice that this thread was started a few days ago. Was just going to throw the idea out there that it would be really helpful if you could shoot out a mass-message via SR to all us vendors when you know in advance that SR will be down for maintenance.<br /><br />A lot of us are too busy to frequent the forums as much as we would like, so we don&#039;t necessarily notice these posts until the site is actually down. This particular down period came at time when I had just settled in to do a whole bunch of new listings and other work. Would be great in future if we all knew in advance so we could manage our time better.<br /><br />Not complaining. I know these things need to be done, and you guys bust your asses to make this place as awesome as it is. Just throwing the idea out there for the future.<br /><br />Good luck, and may your your balls be free of aches!<br /><br />Kind regards, GE

				Thanks for the new updates to all at the SR administration crew!!&nbsp; :) The new currency options are very helpful in regard to saving time when I&#039;m looking to get bitcoins for future purchases. Things are getting made easier and easier for us customers!! I love it!! Thanks again to all the SR Administration and Maintenance Teams and also thanks to DPR aswell . Keep up the stellar work guys you&#039;re all doing great work!!!&nbsp; ;) ;)<br /><br />This place really is getting better and better gradually as time passes us by. It will be very interesting to see what&#039;s on offer and the changes to SR both aesthetically in regard to the site itself and additions to products and services on offer. For instance will we ever see the armory again? OK it&#039;s probably not the best example but how about if SR added a Jewellery &amp; Valuables category on its menu?? Bare in mind this is just an example. I&#039;m pretty sure that jewellery would probably be put in the collectibles section anyway is people wanted to list jewellery then yeah?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :-\&nbsp; ???<br /><br />

				Before this update if you ordered more of 1 item, it would put your order into a higher &quot;tax&quot; bracket and make it cheaper as the SR fee is less percentage for more items. This no longer is the case. Any reasoning for this? If I order 3x a 10g listing shouldnt it be in the same bracket as a 30g listing of the same price?

In the spirit of transparency knowing the exact exchange rate is useful. Especially when the rate is taken from an unknown mix of sources, seeing what it actually is allows you to plan better and know what you will be getting for your $.<br /><br />It would be great to see on every page. 1BTC=xUSD in small print, in grey, maybe at the bottom. But see no reason not to keep it in the same area in the cart as before.<br /><br />And cheers on the new updates, the new categories, currencies, keeping us all informed and fighting the good fight! <br /><br />+1<br />

				As a vendor I like the changes implemented thus far but I&#039;m having a few problems with the USD price of Bitcoin the sites is calculating as its remained unchanged at around $84 for the last couple of days. There is no exchange or person that will buy my Bitcoin for that much. I can&#039;t sell products in this kind of environment as this change represents more than a 10% difference with todays drop, even if hedged. Both BMR and Atlantis list the price the site currently see Bitcoin at. I don&#039;t need to see a breakdown as to why it takes that price but vendors need to see what value they are getting for their products all the time at the top of the page. I would be appreciative for that feature and know that it moves every 4 hours or so with changes in the day.<br /><br />Please and thank you for your consideration in advance.

				Boy I&#039;m not sharp at all today. Of course a buyer can see his account balance in either BTC or his chosen fiat currency, as can I.<br /><br />In my defense, I am truly exhausted.

				DPR PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE - ADD THIS ONE ADDITIONAL CHANGE TO THE SITE:<br /><br />As a customer and then a vendor it has become very important for me to be able to see listings on vendors profile pages in an organized manner.<br /><br />As a customer I appreciate when I see a vendor with organized listings, the same type of item, neat titles, with amounts descending from large to small etc. Its much more difficult to compare listings if there is even a single product because I have to go back an forth and match titles and pricing and then try to create an order in my head instead of direct side by side over and under comparing. This is much worse for vendors with multiple varieties of items and are completely in crazy order, its awful to try and compare, just clicking back and forth or having to open all of the windows and then make page by page comparisons etc.<br /><br />As&nbsp; vendor I realized once I began listing that listings are listed on your vendor profile page descending in the order they were created. If I don&#039;t create them in a specific order then they are all unorganized and I cannot make them appear in any other way other than that. If I make a few listings and then grow to be able to offer more and different items its all strewn about in the order I was able to list them, not in the order I wish them to be displayed in order to properly inform my clientele about what products I have all grouped together so they don&#039;t have to go to every page or can&#039;t get a good read because they are all over the place on the same page and harder to compare pricing etc.<br /><br />I know I would sell more of all of my products if I could organize the order they are displayed in on my page. On the &quot;Your Listings&quot; page you could have up and down arrows at the end of each listing so you could bit by bit order your listings in the order you want them to appear on your vendor profile. THAT WOULD BE AMAZING AND I&#039;M SURE EVERY VENDOR AND EVERY USER WOULD BE VERY APPRECIATIVE.<br /><br />You answered my previous concern very quickly and even added in the new feature showing the price the site see a bitcoin valued at in a currency of your choosing. I would be very appreciative if you could implement a simple change like this or in any other way as long as vendors could gain some control over this element of their marketing. <br /><br />Feel free to direct message me.
