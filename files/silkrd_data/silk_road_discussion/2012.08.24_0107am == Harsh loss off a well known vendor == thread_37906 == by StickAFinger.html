				you gotta be fucking kidding me. You make a mistake and want us to give you money. The fuck kinda 13 yr old logic is that. How about you don&#039;t finalize early so you can take it to resolution only to get scammed by that too.

				I&#039;m surprised such an experienced user of SR would allow themselves to get into a situation where they could be scammed by a vendor. I assume you have FE for this vendor. Sorry, but when buyers do this (fuck knows why) they really only have themselves to blame. Sorry for your loss though but as they say, you live and learn. :)

Don&#039;t be pressured into FE just because the vendor might give you extra product if you do. DON&#039;T FE.

				LOL, really, begging?<br /><br />Let&#039;s establish &quot;SR Finalize Early Victims&quot; fund. Yeah, right. Got scammed? Tough shit. Finalizing early is something you do at your own risk.<br /><br />Besides, money you spend on SR is money you can afford to lose. I lost TWICE and finally learned NOT to finalize early no matter if the vendor is Jesus Christ or Buddha or my grandma. This lesson will cost everyone a few dollars, but that way it is more effective ;)

				Props to you peels4u. A great attitude from an up and coming vendor.<br />I don&#039;t agree with calling StickAFinger a faggot, amongst other terms, just cause he fucked up big time.<br />I&#039;m sure he already feels like shit. At least he has now made others aware of what&#039;s happened and potentially saved others from making the same mistake. IMO, StickAFinger made the mistake of asking others to chip in to help compensate for his own mistake which never sits well with people, and rightly so.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				haha well, atleast you&#039;re not one of them guys who lose money then honestly believe people should help you out, I can respect that.

				Good to see you guys have shaken hands and are joking around a little.&nbsp; ;D One of the best sayings I ever heard when I was a lot younger was <br />&quot;It&#039;s nice to be important but it&#039;s more important to be nice&quot;. It &#039;s not difficult to be nice and considerate of others. I&#039;ve found in life that if you treat others nicely with respect, it&#039;s usually reciprocated. There are always exceptions to the rule but generally speaking, people are nice and polite to you if&nbsp; you are nice and polite to them. :)
