				Probably hasn&#039;t changed the photos since that hack. Vendors had to change their photos manually after that.

				This is a post by the Administor, inigo, on another thread about this issue. It was posted only moments ago.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; Also, in regards to the SR Quick Buy fiasco. If you see any listings with their pictures still affected, please report those listings immediately so we can take those pictures down, as I did with the listing mentioned in this thread. We did close the hole that allowed the code to enter our system, but all the pictures that were affected have to be dealt with individually, and for the vendors who are too incompetent to fix their own listings, the burden falls on you guys to report the listings you find.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Personally if I see a vendor with those pictures still it immediately lowers my opinion of them and kills any chance of my buying from them.<br /><br />They&#039;ve had about a month to fix it.&nbsp; Lazy Mfers.

I have actually heard very good things about her product despite the high price (even by East Coast standards). I messaged her, that is as much as I will do.
