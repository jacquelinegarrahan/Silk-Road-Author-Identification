				The silly thing here is that the rating system is so flawed that a 4/5 score is considered bad. There&#039;s 5 possibilities, with 4 of them being bad and 1 being good, and everybody just gives 5/5 all the time even when it should really be 4/5 or even 3/5.<br /><br />When ordering 28g and receiving 27.7 you didn&#039;t actually get 100% of what you paid for, so you are not 100% satisfied. Granted it&#039;s not that much, but still. If the vendors scale isn&#039;t accurate enough, it&#039;s on him.<br /><br />But yeah because 5/5 ratings are so important, the buyer could have let the vendor know before he gave the 4/5, and give him a chance to make it up.

				Also, if there is a problem,&nbsp; the buyer should ALWAYS contact the vendor before leaving anything other than 1/5. Most of the time these things can be sorted out with communication. <br />But to be honest, I wouldn&#039;t want to be giving a partial refund or a refund to someone who had already finalised and not left 5/5.<br /><br />Also make sure your scales are calibrated and have been checked before claiming a product is underweight.

				I was angry too last week because a buyer did give 1/5 to a vendor because the product was not good (in the opinion of the buyer). Now, since I knew perfectly the product of that vendor, I knew without a doubt that the mistake was on the buyer and for this I even started a topic. IMO some buyers take the feedback system too lightly and without the responsibility needed.<br /><br />Feedback is very important for buyers and the only thing we have to understand the validity of a vendor, and while I agree that the system we have now could be improved, it is what we have atm and so we must work with it in the best way possible. Since giving 4/5 instead of 5/5 lower the stats of the vendor, this is NOT justifiable for a so little less in weight. If the buyer was really so much troubled about it (and, I mean, that difference in weight in 30 g is literally nothing) s/he could have contacted the vendor and tried to resolve the issue instead of leaving less feedback for nothing at all.<br /><br />Sincerely if I was the vendor I don&#039;t know if I would like to make business with that guy again in the future; I find what s/he did extremely unpolite given the system we have.

				I don&#039;t see the problem. If I see a ton of proper 5/5 feedbacks and one or two low ratings for a vendor who&#039;s been around for months and has hundreds of transactions, who gives a fuck if he&#039;s 99 or 100? It&#039;s all good.<br /><br />Now what does piss me off though is checking out a vendor&#039;s feedback and seeing endless 5/5&#039;s with useless comments like &#039;FE&#039; or &#039;FE, will update later&#039;. Sometimes you have to wade through pages and pages of feedback before you can begin to get an accurate picture of just how realistic that 100 rating is.

				Why do people say the SR numerical rating is useless? <br /><br />If a user thinks they got 4/5 service, they should post 4/5. <br /><br />Sure there are random assholes who unfairly give feedback but any smart buyer is going to see most feedback is not like the asshole&#039;s feedback, and so not be scared off?<br /><br />And those buyers that are scared off by a single non 5/5 feedback are pussies who probably will get busted anyway so... who loses?<br /><br />Some 3/5 or 4/5 is normal, so not sure why people are saying the rating system doesn&#039;t work?<br /><br />Works fine here.

				because people don&#039;t use it properly. your not getting an accurate representation of transactions. almost everyone leaves 5/5. occasionally someone who really feels screwed will leave a 1/5. some vendors even say in their profile you MUST leave a 5/5 feedback. so in reality its basically a 2 option system, 1/5 and 5/5. like one a vendor sent me the wrong product, i contacted him and he told me to keep what he sent me and he resent my order and told me to leave a 5/5. now what he first sent me i didnt want, i dont use it and never ordered it. he did the right thing by reshipping but i didnt have my product for the date i wanted to. i should have given him a 4/5 but me and like so many other people made it 5/5. plus its overloaded with FE&#039;s being marked as 5/5. if a seller has a 98% overall score and 80% of his ratings are for FE&#039;s it doesnt have much value.. sellers get angry with buyers for putting anything less then a 5/5. so you almost feel pressured to leave 5/5 even though a 4/5 would still be a good rating if the system was used properly<br />thats just my opinion. i dont base much off the %.&nbsp; i still use it as reference. i read all the comments and use the forum mostly.

				@RobLoblaw<br /><br />Think you&#039;re missing the point of why this works. <br /><br />FOr one, you don&#039;t have to give 5/5.... EVER. If a vendor is threatening you for not giving 5/5, report him, that&#039;s why the reporting system is there and it works. Threatening buyers is absolutely not tolerated on SR, but you do have to report that shit.<br /><br />Hell you should probably report vendors who demand 5/5 in any case, because they&#039;re just bullys. and that shit don&#039;t fly here.<br /><br />For two, i see tons of non 100 vendors... shit happens and yeah there are occassional dipshits, but there is NEVER 100% dipshits... if vendor has a sub 90% rating, it&#039;s likely because they suck ass.<br /><br />it&#039;s like the old saying, if you meet 1 person in a day who calls you a jerk, ok he&#039;s the jerk, but if you meet 3, well odds are good YOU are the jerk.<br /><br />Get the picture?<br /><br />@ tragicallyhip<br />&quot;but if everyone did this it could seriously affect my sales&quot;<br />Yae but it&#039;s never that case, so what are you complaining about? Because your pristine 100% is affected? Lighten up fFrancis. Smart buyers know betteer than to be swayed by a few dipshits leaving 1/5 because the band youlike suckx.<br /><br /><br />Think some vendors are overly sensitive to getting 100% like it&#039;s a fucking xbox achievemnt they can&#039;t see the harm they are causing by stressing about it.

Threatening buyers is absolutely not tolerated on SR, but you do have to report that shit.<br /><br />Hell you should probably report vendors who demand 5/5 in any case, because they&#039;re just bullys. and that shit don&#039;t fly here.<br /><br />For two, i see tons of non 100 vendors... shit happens and yeah there are occassional dipshits, but there is NEVER 100% dipshits... if vendor has a sub 90% rating, it&#039;s likely because they suck ass.<br /><br />it&#039;s like the old saying, if you meet 1 person in a day who calls you a jerk, ok he&#039;s the jerk, but if you meet 3, well odds are good YOU are the jerk.<br /><br />Get the picture?<br /><br />@ tragicallyhip<br />&quot;but if everyone did this it could seriously affect my sales&quot;<br />Yae but it&#039;s never that case, so what are you complaining about? Because your pristine 100% is affected? Lighten up fFrancis. Smart buyers know betteer than to be swayed by a few dipshits leaving 1/5 because the band youlike suckx.<br /><br /><br />Think some vendors are overly sensitive to getting 100% like it&#039;s a fucking xbox achievemnt they can&#039;t see the harm they are causing by stressing about it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yea but when you work very hard to try and please every single customer, it&#039;s pretty disappointing to receive bad feedback. Especially when the buyer makes NO EFFORT to resolve the issue. They just leave 1/5 and never reply to messages.<br /><br />Think of it this way: You were doing an assignment for university / school and you put in a lot of effort and were expecting a good mark. For some reason you get marked a F, and the teacher won&#039;t tell you why you got an F. That&#039;s what it&#039;s like to get low feedback.

				It&#039;s not skeweed because most buyers reasonably konw that 90%-100% is a good vendor, if a vendor is less than 90% or so, yeah they usually have an option to go with another vednor.<br /><br />And so any vendor less 90% has good reason to up their game... that&#039;s the point. You compete on prices, on product quality, on service, on stealth... otherwise where is vendor encentive to do a good job? <br /><br /><br />No, the feedback system works when buyers have freedom to leave feedback they think is justified, without reprocussion or threat from the vendor.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if vendors think they have any right to say how buyers should leave feedback, but you don&#039;t (AT ALL) and really thinking you do is an effort that just undermines the whole feedback systgem.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s true some buyers are assholes and leave bad feedback without what most of us would consider unjutsified reason, but htere are never enough of such buyers to significantly sway a vendor&#039;s rating, otherwise, then yeah it&#039;s probably the vendor -- see how that works?<br /><br />READ THE ABOVE SENTENCE AGAIN because i think some of you have missed it (already stated above).<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s why the rating system works, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s just fine (clamoring to reach 100% is wanking excercise)<br />

				I think an ebay style system with points would be better..

				jase00: Man after reading this thread I thought the exact same thought. Maybe the rating system of 5 points should just be reduced to a 3 point value. -1 for negative / 0 for a ok or neutral / +1 for positive transaction. Also a temporary point for FE but it would then be required to change it to one of the other three options once you get your stuff. And I don&#039;t believe everyone would remember or care enough to do so.

				I have seen transactions rated 1/5 for shipping speed, this was on international order that took two weeks. Other transactions have been rated 1/5 for not receiving product but getting 100% refunds. Vendors get bad ratings for dumb reasons, I think it is part of the game.<br /><br />When I am researching vendors I try to read the negative feedbacks and make my own decision.

				I think that a bit of communication could&#039;ve solved it all.&nbsp; I always try to talk things out first, however, I also agree that if he was not completely satisfied then why should he leave 5/5?&nbsp; The rating system here is bogus.&nbsp; I&#039;ve specifically ordered from a different vendor to give them a shot after reading feedback like, &quot;excellent stealth&quot;, when what I received was FAR from stealthy at all!&nbsp; Actually I am surprised I didn&#039;t get popped!!&nbsp;

				Yep the&nbsp; protocol should&nbsp; be to first communicate any dissatisfaction with the vendor before leaving an honest feedback score , that explains the good , the bad and the ugly - so as to help future buyers make a more informed buying choice . <br /><br />I personally would&nbsp; like to see feedback scores split into sub categories - i.e communication&nbsp; 1 -5 , product quality 1- 5 - dispatch time 1- 5&nbsp; .<br /><br />We were discussing&nbsp; the same kind of thing in this thread here&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166796.0&nbsp; &nbsp; .
