				https://github.com/Bit-Wasp/BitWasp#readme<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What is BitWasp<br />BitWasp is an open source project which aims to lower the barrier for anyone to set up there own secure, anonymous marketplace. It is envisaged that BitWasp will be used on Tor hidden services. As such it is designed with speed in mind. This project will also eventually full integrate with BitCoin providing a secure escrow service for buyers and sellers. This project is still in its very early stages. There is a preliminary planning document at https://piratenpad.de/p/bitwasp-planning<br /><br />If you can help or have any ideas please join us on http://www.thelaboratory.org<br /><br />WARNING - BitWasp is NOT production ready<br />This project is very much under development and we have not yet made a beta release. Please be aware that this project has not yet undergone extensive security testing and the code base is still missiing a number of key features. Please download and test the code by all means but we would strongly recommend it is not deployed on a production system. We will update this README when there is a beta release.<br /><br />Installation and Configuration<br />To set up BitWasp, first make ./application/config and ./assets/images writable.<br /><br />chmod 777 ./application/config chmod 777 -R ./assets/images<br /><br />And then visit the installer page to set up the marketplace.<br /><br />Support Bitwasp Development<br />All money from donations, supporter and sponsor accounts go to fund BitWasp Development &amp; Operation. Bitcoin Address: 19wXXScUGcpTUZUYo4kaevoLZKczE8G7q<br /><br />All help and contributions in getting Bitwasp completed are very much appreciated as the time of the lead developers is currently very limited.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />https://github.com/Bit-Wasp/BitWasp#readme<br /><br />I&#039;m sure the scammers will love it&nbsp; ???

				Pretty sweet though! Nice to know the idea is spreading! But I&#039;m sure (for this moment at least) nothing will be like SR!<br />Yeah it&#039;ll definitely be used by scammers but it doesn&#039;t worry me that much because once you know the real site all you gotta do is bookmark it!

				One of the developers started a long thread about this on the forum.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70545.0<br /><br />Also, I can&#039;t find it now, maybe the thread was deleted, but somebody else started a fork of BitWasp.<br /><br />The project has positives and negatives. A positive is that anybody can start their own market place without paying huge fees. A negative is that it&#039;s harder for buyers to confirm the authenticity of the vendors.

				Yeah the primary author was here on these forums for about a week raising awareness. I fear this project (which I had heard of a while ago) while a good idea...is VERY slow in being coded.<br /><br /><br />There is already a fork of Bit-Wasp.... I dont recall the name, but again the author was here for a bit. Stated what he didnt like about Bit-Wasp and how he was gonna do so much better..... then disappeared.<br /><br /><br />...all these kids and their silly dreams ;)<br />
