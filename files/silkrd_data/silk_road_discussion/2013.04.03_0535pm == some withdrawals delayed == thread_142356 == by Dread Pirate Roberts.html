				UPDATE (1753 UTC): We are all caught up on withdrawals.&nbsp; If you have any outstanding withdrawals that are over 6 hours old, there could be an issue.&nbsp; Read the FAQ on the wiki and follow the directions for dealing with a missing withdrawal.<br /><br />UPDATE (0100 UTC): Ok, everything is on track to get caught up now.&nbsp; Right now our best estimate is 24 more hours until the last severely delayed withdrawal goes through.&nbsp; All others are going through normally, with the current delay still around 4 hours, but shrinking.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep you updated here on that 24 hour estimate.<br /><br />UPDATE (2252 UTC): Finally got to the bottom of the situation.&nbsp; Current withdrawals are flowing again, and are about 4 hours behind right now.&nbsp; The withdrawals that were severely delayed are almost 2 days old at this point and my best estimates doesn&#039;t have them complete for several more days at the current rate.&nbsp; That is too long to wait, so we are working on a solution to roll these back and redo them.<br /><br />UPDATE (2020 UTC):&nbsp; There are a few hundred withdrawals taking up to 36 hours to get into the blockchain that are holding up the show.&nbsp; We are going to section these off to deal with them separately and get current withdrawals flowing again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just a heads up that we are aware that some withdrawals are delayed right now.&nbsp; They are in the system and accounted for and we will get them out asap.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you know here when we are all caught up so if your withdrawal is still missing you can follow up on it.

				Went to sleep last night last night confident the situation would be resolved, not so confident about the likely time-frame... Woke up to find a forum post and an SR msg from DPR promising he&#039;s on the case. Maybe I have a little Stockholm syndrome, but sometimes this place is so awesome it hurts. I know it sucks to have your coin tied up, but it&#039;s not lost, you will get it back. Thanks DPR &amp; SR support!! AB

				i&#039;ve had a few transactions stuck at 0 confirmations for a couple days now. i assume this is what you are talking about. i had some auto withdrawals today that haven&#039;t broadcast to the network at all (yet) but show up on account history. i suppose it will work itself out. <br />regarding the bitcoin value, sure we went from 150 to 110 today, but that is only to be expected with such a rapid bubble. it went from 100 to 150 in like 2 days. i doubt it falls below 100 before it stabilizes and steadily up we go again. in other words, hedge your listings.

				Thanks for the updates.&nbsp; I&#039;ve a question though:&nbsp; How anonymous are the withdrawals.&nbsp; Say I wanted to transfer some SR change to Blockchain.info to Bitfloor (which requires ID to cash out) how traceable is that?&nbsp; Just curious if the SR tumbler works for withdrawals as well.&nbsp; Thanks all!
