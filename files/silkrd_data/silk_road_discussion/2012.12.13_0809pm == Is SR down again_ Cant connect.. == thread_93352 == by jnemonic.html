				I&#039;ve had spotty connection to SR for the past week or so, and recently quite a lot of &quot;500 Internal Server Error&quot; messages have been showing up. Now I can finally connect to SR, but that error shows up every time instead of login screen. Hopefully they&#039;re working to address it and aren&#039;t getting high on all the drugs ;)

Nobody&#039;s making you buy drugs off the internet. If you&#039;re not aware of the risks and the consequences involved (which include SR being down) then go back to your dealer. SR has done a great service to me so far. I have nothing but thanks and good wishes for them.

				Yeah, 500 - Internal Server Error at this moment.. I was able to get on about an hour ago and complete my current &#039;business&#039; but it did take about 7 or 8 tries to get on. Agreed that it&#039;s easier to get on the forums as well.

				Sheesh, this is the third thread in 2 days on SR downtime. It&#039;s giving me problems today like any other day. Try getting a new identity, that can often fix the problem. There are the most amount of people I&#039;ve ever seen: 138. It&#039;s usually around 85 but it&#039;s just exploded. <br /><br />Another thing too, for the first time ever, I couldn&#039;t connect to Tor. It aborted while loading. I restarted my computer twice. That was weird.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t get on to SR, I&#039;d suggest waiting, and not loading it up through surface web on onion.to. It&#039;s a temptation as it&#039;s faster, but you might as well have sex with a cobra. Just as safe.It WILL unmask you and then you&#039;re screwed. Like that cobra.

				I got on just now after about 20 CAPTCHA attempts. The login page loads fine, I just couldn&#039;t get past it. I knew something was up when it started showing me Ironic CAPTCHAS. For some reason (probably coinsidence) when I start getting really ironic CAPTCHAs the site is having issues.<br /><br />It would be difficult for a person to convince me that Onion.to and other forwarding sites are not partially to blame. The current SR problem seems to be mostly Too Many Requests. I have a feeling these sites are requesting connections at programmed intervals. Its the ONLY explanation that I can think of for why Onion.to will load SR faster than direct TOR connect!<br /><br />(don&#039;t log in using Onion.to or any other forwarding site or i&#039;ll kill you.)<br /><br />First captcha was <br />JUNKIXXX<br />i was like... how the fuck did YOU know that?!<br /><br />then the very next Captcha was <br />KARMAXXX<br /><br />I was ROTFL!!!!!!!!<br />&nbsp;8)

				It&#039;s working again for me but now the vendor i wanted to order from has his listing down so looks like i am waiting until next week. It still doesn&#039;t matter to me because i love this place. It may not be perfect but there is a lot of effort that goes into it and many honest vendors with amazing stuff i would never be able to get without this site. Hope the connection issues get resolved soon but I&#039;m a loyal fan none the less.
