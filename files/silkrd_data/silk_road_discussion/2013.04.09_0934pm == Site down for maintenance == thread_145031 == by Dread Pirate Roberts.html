				Thanks for the update. Fingers crossed my order went out before maintenance, but glad to await further improvements to the site, whether they be security related, implementation of new features, or a way to force new vendors to stop asking for FE. <br /><br />Doing a great job.

				Thanks for updating us all DPR. I was about to transfer some Btc out of my wallet on SR for essentially an investment holding on my PC wallet during this bull market. But understandably this system/site is not going to have a 100% uptime, as much as many of us would like it to be its just not Amazon.&nbsp; Anyways I appreciate the notice it makes me feel more comfortable about my account funds, not that the monetary value I have invested was a lot, however with this BTC bubble happening it currently is making my initial investment worth quite a bit more. Eagerly but patiently waiting for access.<br /><br />Just wanna say thank you for making this service available. I have been using SR for over a year now I think and it amazes me to this day the quality and service of the site and its vendors. I hope vendors and DPR are able to capitalize on the BTC price spike, even if it is just a bubble I don`t think it will ever be $3 per coin again, lol. I have been doing some reading about the increase and it seems obvious the more public BTC gets with more sites/services accepting it, I bought my VPN with it, the more its worth. Although I`m sure the miners are running full steam and maybe doing some upgrades it seems that they wont be solving blocks fast enough? Plus there is only a finite amount that can be made/solved. Wow getting long winded here, no drug listings to distract me. :)
