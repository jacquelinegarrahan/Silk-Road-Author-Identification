				I am talking on behalf of SR community and I know people will agree with me!<br />No, I do not have a paranoid personality but things are getting weird!<br /><br />First, all the MODS magically get demoted. They were the persons talking to you often, they knew the way you speak and how you handle things. They were the persons that would have warned us in case SR would have been compromised, they would have noticed. We don&#039;t know whom to ask if we need things sorted on the forum. <br /><br />E.g last week one vendor updated a photo on the forum without removing the GPS coordinates from it. I warned Guru about the situation and he edited and removed the photo from the forum. The vendor is safe, thanks to that small edit.<br /><br />Second, Asylum&#039;s friend warned us about him getting arrested and everything being compromised. Later Asylum posts on the forum that his account was actually hacked. Funny, he was a good vendor and I highly doubt that he would have fallen a victim to the recent phising website. How do we know for sure LE did not takeover his activity? PGP? Nope that would not answer our question as his PGP could also be compromised.<br /><br />I believe that first persons getting busted on SR would become an example. By example I mean they will get maximum sentences to warn people, we are growing and we all know it. SR would eventually become mainstream it&#039;s natural. This means that police will put lots of effort and resources in stopping this. I am not saying they will stop it but as you, DPR said &quot;there will be many fights&quot;.<br /><br />I believe we need some updates when major things like removing all the mods happen.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.<br /><br />Long live Silk Road!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yep, for some reason people seem to think sr is a super secret drug club when actuality we&#039;re already main stream, shit, there&#039;s been loads of articles on sr by huge media groups. It&#039;s not a secret anymore and it&#039;s been that way for quite some time. Get over it hipsters.

				The gawker article came out due to the writer having discussions with SR. Maybe calling it an interview was incorrect, but it was discussed at length on the forum (when the forum was part of the store and not separate) and SR decided to have talks with the reporter...anyway my point is still valid.

This is what this person will say to justify his behavior, and it’s completely irresponsible,” VanBomel (idiot who is so miserable being sober that he has to work at a rehab and go to 12 step meetings when he isn&#039;t working).<br /><br />then the douche also says &quot;You cannot possibly offer acid to people and think that’s helpful,” VanBomel said.<br /><br />What a giant asshole.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It really angers me that such a ridiculously unfounded counter statement to a perfectly logical argument goes unchallenged.&nbsp; I mean really.&nbsp; It&#039;s terribly upsettting.&nbsp; The statement about Silk Road&#039;s intended consequences was spot on.&nbsp; I mean I buy my meth here exclusively, and it gets better and cheaper all the fucking time.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; Period.<br /><br />Why do they want me to kill myself faster instead of slower and more productive?&nbsp; They&#039;re so mean... :(

They only make money if there are customers buying, and the only way to get customers is to advertise the site. This was proven in the early days when Silk Road gave an interview to gawker against the advise of other members who wanted it to remain small and secretive. Without that interview, the site may well have fizzled off and died, then where would the many people who have joined since then be?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>my bad, then

Yet, somehow, there seems to be little shortage of time to endlessly debate the Libertarian equivalent of &quot;How many Angels can dance on the head of a pin?&quot; in DPR&#039;s various Book Club threads. <br /><br />From all appearances, it would seem that customer communications takes a back-seat to debates about minutiae of Libertarian philosophy. <br />So, it&#039;s not a question of not having enough time, it&#039;s a question of resource allocation: in other words, deciding what is important to you. <br />As the old adage goes, &quot;Actions speak louder than words.&quot;<br /><br />NC

				Hi gang, sorry i&#039;ve not been around this week i was really bad off with strep throat.<br /><br />This is the first thread i saw an opened so i&#039;m starting here and I assume I have agiagantor road ahead of me to get to everyone&#039;s questions and issues, I&#039;ll start by saying I don&#039;t really have an answers myself for many of the questions but I of any of the memebers of the community can surely shed some light and apply logic to the situation and ease some minds.<br /><br />First I&#039;d like to say that the members in general shouldnt worry too much you are not gonna be arrested for silk road unless you are purchasing above personal amounts. If LE was going after Silk Road it would be the leaders. I consider myself in a leadership position having being the original moderator and the only SR forum staff member that has been here since day one. Never the less i do not believe I would be targeted as a leader&nbsp; to arrest as I am a mere forum moderator and have nothing to do with anything that happens on&nbsp; Silk Road Marketplace except for the few legal products I offer in my modest profile. I occasionally purchase small personal amounts of whatever I&#039;m in the mood for and I consume it far from public in my home were i am usually behind the keyboard like at this moment.&nbsp; Which brings me to a rather obvious point i&#039;d like to share not only to average silkroad member that simply wants to stay home and relax from the what is every climbing stressful country we live in the domestic US. I feel this a is where the true revolution begins with SIlk Road, it allows common people of our nature the safety of not having to go out into the crazy world and illegally purchase simple chemicals to increase our quality of life and it also allows us to stay home and not be in public were incidents could occur that would have negative outcomes for in numerous variety of ways. To me this is the way a logical war on drug related accidents should be started instead of the drugs themselves. It solves the demon aspect that we get <br />portrayed.<br />Why take a away freedoms when this country could be adding to the freedoms and create a new system to help lower the debt wars of all kind have dragged this country to it&#039;s current state.<br /><br />So let me assure you all I am here and I will continue to be here to help spread information and knowledge I have and dispel misinformation which seems have been growing the more the membership grows. Yes the title is gone above the moderator)s) name but I personally don&#039;t care for titles which generally create an idea that because this person has this title then what they say must be true, It&#039;s classic misdirection in most cases in an unusual place.<br /><br />To the older members you know me well served the forum community selflessly since it&#039;s creation in hopes to help and educate the community to grow and prosper in a positive manner that even I do not know of it truly unlimited potential.<br /><br />To the newer members that may not have seen me around as much or even know of my history here and how much time I volunteer here with passion to see that both the customers and vendors are both not only kept inline but that both sides are treated as equals and not with either side having a dominating force as to give the community power not individuals. It is the members of the forum I volunteer for not Silk Road so feel free to PM me with your own questions if you can not find them using the search function which works excellently in almost all cases.<br /><br /><br />I hope this helps to calm some that seem to feel abandoned by&nbsp; the real leaders of Silk Road that are in a constant state of repair, I believe at this moment there are two glitches in the listing one is with having to enter shipping areas every time you make a new listing...some reason the defaults arent working and second glitch i know of is that thew listings are gong up with out postage options which shouldnt happen. <br />If you find bugs or glitches on the marketplace please take it upon yourself to report them top SR Support via PM.<br /><br /><br />X)<br />nomad bloodbath
