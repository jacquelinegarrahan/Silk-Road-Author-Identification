				Hey,<br /><br />I just wanted to cancel an order from a vendor that has disappeared a few days ago (not online since 5 days, every listing is gone).<br />Now I was curious what happens if I cancel:<br /><br />&nbsp;- What happens to my address (ofc pgp crypted, but still)?<br />&nbsp;- Do I get all my coins back?<br />&nbsp;- Does it affect my buyer stats in any way?<br /><br />Thanks a lot

				So long as they didn&#039;t take a carbon copy of your address it&#039;ll be deleted.<br />You will get your coins back, but it depends if it was hedged against the dollar. If so you will receive the dollar amount you spent in bitcoins back, if not you will receive the bitcoins you spent.<br />It won&#039;t affect your buyer stats in any way.<br /><br />Hope this clears it up

				One would assume so, unless they are a stupid vendor.<br />I canceled on order after nothing happened for 5 days, it then got delivered to me.<br />This was a mistake on the sellers behalf not marking it in transit, but if they haven&#039;t been on for 5 days then it&#039;s safe to assume they haven&#039;t posted it.

				Alright thanks, but actually I meant: Isn&#039;t the message itself deleted by the SilkRoad system or anything?<br />So if I get you right, they still receive my address and stuff but just don&#039;t send / don&#039;t receive the coins?<br /><br />thanks

				I believe this is the case, I&#039;m not 100% but it makes a lot more sense doing it this way.
