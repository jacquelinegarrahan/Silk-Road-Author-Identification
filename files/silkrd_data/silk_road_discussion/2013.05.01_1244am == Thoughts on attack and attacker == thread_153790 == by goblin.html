				Why would the government be behind this?&nbsp; Don&#039;t you think they&#039;d rather take down SR in a very public way with big headline busts and the like?&nbsp; I don&#039;t see DDoS&#039;ing SR to push business to other markets as a government tactic.&nbsp; This, in my opinion, has nothing to do with the government and everything to do with an angry individual or individuals.

				There&#039;s no government incentive in this really...<br /><br />I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll ever know who decided to do this unless DPR finds something out or the attacker makes some sort of public statement. There have already been &quot;reports&quot; that the attacker(s) was/were doing it for a ransom, so I wouldn&#039;t expect any really accurate information from anyone other than the parties participating in this &quot;cyber war&quot;

				It has no sense to shutting down SR in this way by government but usually they&#039;re stupid so maybe they stay behind the attack ? However people wouldn&#039;t be happy if they heard that government spend funds from their taxes on fighting with website which is not main danger now.<br />Another hypothesis is that they&#039;re doing DDoS to check site engine, software and find some bugs. <br />But as I remember we had some DDoS in past and in past site was unable to reach for couple of days so I have some hope but what is worst in this case is that here is community but except all this community there&#039;s thousands of normal SilkRoad users whose don&#039;t follow all DPR updates and they&#039;re wondering what is happening and site will lose so much customers in this way if DPR don&#039;t turn it on back prompt.<br /><br />My future idea is to promote more this forum because people has to have some place where they can come back and share their ideas / talk with each other or just feel stronger together. <br />

They use computers all over the world that are unknowingly infected with software that runs in the background and takes control over their resources. The infected computers make up a what&#039;s called a botnet. They will likely have thousands to tens-of-thousands of bots in their botnet at a given time. The botnet operator can control the infected computers in various ways, which can be further enhanced and customized by scripting or coding your own programs, or by modifying existing ones.<br /><br />The one thing the attack does have to do to maintain the botnet is add bots to it. A percentage of people will detect the software and remove it from their computer, thus removing a bot from the botnet. There are paid and non paid methods to add bots. If this is a skilled attacker who can program, he already has a bunch of non paid ways set up to automatically add bots via torrents and usenet. I would bet the attacker is skilled and can program since the way they are DOSing SR would require a custom Tor client, or scripting of Tor connections and is a-typical of normal DOS methods.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>+1, we could use more facts and less speculation.&nbsp; ::)

				Here&#039;s my own analysis based on the somewhat scarce info we have so far. First, this is the info I think is pertinent (please feel free to quote me and add any other info you think is relevant):<br /><br />- Two (or more?) DoS attacks on SR fairly close together for fairly sustained periods of time, though not more that a few days.<br />- No-one has come forward to claim responsibility yet apart from a few obvious fakes<br />- Similar attacks at similar times (though less severe for less time) on Tormail and SR forum<br />- *Possibly* linked DoS attacks on various Bitcoin sites<br />- No similar attacks on SR&#039;s competition; BMR &amp; Atlantis (AFAIK)<br /><br />So, who&#039;s set to profit and how can this info be linked? Firstly, I don&#039;t think the Bitcoin attacks are linked; there are all kinds of reasons for attacking BTC apart from SR as it&#039;s a threat to every central banking system on the planet, plus they&#039;re not on TOR so it&#039;s a different kind of attack. I&#039;m not even sure the Tormail attack is linked; although at similar times, the attacks do not seem to be choreographed at all.<br /><br />Secondly, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the competition in the form of BMR or Atlantis. Why? Because they have as much to lose from this kind of attack, as any market-share they build up could be lost just as easily as SR could lose theirs from this attack. All it does is show that this kind of TOR hidden service can be disrupted, which is not in the best interests of either competitor.<br /><br />Thirdly, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s LE, for all the reasons already stated; it doesn&#039;t help them at all and they have nothing to gain from such a secret and ultimately fruitless action.<br /><br />So who else is set to gain? Street dealers. Organized crime. For decades they&#039;ve had a monopoly on drugs distribution and it has been their principle cash-cow ever since prohibition ended and casinos were legitimatized. Hell, even prostitution is starting to go mainstream - I&#039;ve seen the reality shows of those Bunny Ranches, and you would not believe some of the areas of Frankfurt! Where else other than narcotics can they make such serious sums? And it&#039;s not just the direct market share SR et al are elbowing in on (though I imagine that&#039;s significant and growing), but the way it pushes up quality; in the old model you knew the dealer or two in your area and you had to buy from them, so the local suppliers could cut everything as much as they wanted and the product could be as poor as they like and what you gonna do about it? On SR there are reviews and options, so competition pushes up quality (one reason I prefer it). This means that organized-crime needs to up quality to compete, further hitting profits. And any criminal mafia-style organization wouldn&#039;t need to take credit for the attack, all they would need to do is make online dealing unstable enough to drive people back to street-dealing.<br /><br />So, I think it&#039;s probably some kind of traditional drug-supply syndicate - mafia or some such - trying to protect their own business. Traditionally they would try a broken knee-cap or head or two, but online they are reduced to DoSing....
