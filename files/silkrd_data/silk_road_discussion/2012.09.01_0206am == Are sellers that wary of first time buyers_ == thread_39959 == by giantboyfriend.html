				Yesterday I messaged 2 different very active and highly rated sellers with some general inquiries about shipping and stuff. I explained that as a new buyer I would expect to have to FE and that was cool and just had some very basic questions. I even encrytped the messages even though they had no sensitive information at all.<br /><br />Now today both sellers appear to have no listings so I&#039;m assuming they must have blocked me, the stuff I was inquiring about was not high volume or anything is there something I&#039;m doing wrong or are some sellers that wary of new buyers? I feel like an idiot and also very sad as one of them is the only domestic vendor for what I&#039;m looking for. Any tips or help would be appreciated.

				One of them just replied and said he was unable to read my message and forgot to ask me to re-encrypt it. He said he is just out of stock, ok so maybe it was just a crazy coincidence!

				Sellers can not block a buyer from seeing there listings. They can block everyone who is not their fan by going stealth but not individuals.<br /><br />Best to start small and build up some rep first. There are a lot of vendors who welcome new people and are more than happy to work with them.

				there&#039;s always vendors willing to work with first-time buyers.&nbsp; Like you said, you&#039;ll probably have to finalize early, but depending on what exactly you&#039;re looking for, there&#039;s vendors that will allow new buyers to use the escrow system...

				Just use a DCN to protect the seller, and I don&#039;t know why a seller wouldnt sell to a new buyer.

				I usually welcome first time buyers with a freebie. Maybe one of my less popular cigarillos or some stickers.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I want them to feel comfortable and for the transaction to go smooth with a positive customer experience. The more people we have on the road, the better!<br /><br />if you&#039;re interested, make a purchase from me and ill throw in a freebie of your choice. (No dro though ;) )<br /><br />Cheers! <br /><br />Smokeables<br /><br />PS<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m also running a promo now. If you buy something from me, you get 10% back to spend in my store at a later time.

				I try and judge a new buyer on their demeanor and how articulate they are, but I will always welcome any new buyer (so long as they don&#039;t message me with something like I WANT &lt;X&gt; NOW, GET IT ME FAST!!!!).<br /><br />Many established vendors typically state in their profile that new buyers with less then x amount of transactions must finalize early before the vendor ships the package, thus mitigating any concerns of the buyer trying to pull something on you.&nbsp; Sucks for the buyer, but buyers need to establish a &#039;reputation&#039; (trust) just as much as new vendors do right?
