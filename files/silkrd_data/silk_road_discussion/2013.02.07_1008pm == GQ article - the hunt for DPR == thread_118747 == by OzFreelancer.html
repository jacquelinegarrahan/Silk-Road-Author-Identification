				I agree, that is the most thorough and least sensational article I&#039;ve ever read about SR. I would quibble with a few minor details, but overall it&#039;s very good. They interviewed a lot of central people, the researcher Nicolas Christin, Runa Sandvik of the Tor Project, Mike Hearn of Google, who works on Bitcoin -- even DPR, in a sense. ;)<br /><br />A highly recommended read.

				&quot;Intrigued, GQ messaged Silk Road&#039;s administrator - the Dread Pirate Roberts himself - to ask whether he was worried about the law-enforcement agencies trying to track him down.

				Well this is one internet article whose comment section I will *not* be participating in, LOL (comments are tied to Facebook and I don&#039;t want to deal with that).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=118747.msg803603#msg803603">Quote from: dirtybiscuitzz718 on February 07, 2013, 11:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Good read, but i get sooo pissed when SR is mentioned in the media.

They&#039;d have to fuck that investigation BIG time for it to turn out any other way. IMO anyhow. You&#039;re right though. Sloppiness all around. People watch cop shows that tie everything up in an hour and get this impression of law enforcement as a well-oiled criminal-snatching machine. The truth is far from that. A good book that illustrates this is Helter Skelter. It&#039;s written by the lawyer who prosecuted Charley Manson, and it&#039;s fucking phenomenal. It&#039;s one of a handful of book I find myself recommending on a monthly basis.&nbsp;

				Every news article is free advertising. SR owes most its popularity to the media, since it has done zero advertising of its own. SR&#039;s unprecedented popularity means buyers can choose from hundreds of vendors, unlike any other drug site, and vendors have access to tens of thousands of customers, unlike any other drug site. We all win.<br /><br />If the infrastructure is really secure, as DPR says, then I welcome it.<br /><br />I especially like where Adrian Chen said that people were emailing him about how to get on SR. He acts all moralistic, but really he doesn&#039;t give a shit. He continued to write new articles about SR, knowing they would increase the site&#039;s popularity, because those articles get him tons of hits.<br />

				&quot;... Then, last summer, a user by the name &quot;Arkanos&quot; on BitcoinTalk - a forum for enthusiasts - stumbled across a wallet containing more than 500,000 Bitcoins. At the time, the exchange rate was around £5 per coin, valuing the contents at more than £2.5m. Someone was hoarding one of the largest sums of the digital currency ever discovered.

If you PGP encrypt your address, it won&#039;t matter if the database containing shipping info is compromised. The only point at which you must trust SR is when you transfer coins to your account. You trust that they will credit your account and hold your money in escrow. Vendors trust that the coins will be transferred to them. Everything else, including obtaining the coins, can be secured independently of SR.<br /><br />I know that in practice that isn&#039;t the case. 80% of buyers don&#039;t encrypt their address. Most people think that sending coins through a few ewallets unlinks them from SR. We can&#039;t prevent all unsafe behavior, but we have the tools to engage in safe behavior, almost completely independently from SR.<br />
