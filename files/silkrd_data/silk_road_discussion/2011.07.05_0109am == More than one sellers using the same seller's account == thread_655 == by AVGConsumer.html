				I was wondering about the pros and cons.<br /><br />pros:<br />- wider product range ( A sells weed while B sells blotters)<br />- less initial cost (buying a sellers acc)<br />- more continuous supply - less &quot;out of stock&quot; (if A and B also has the same product )<br />- quicker rep buildup<br />- higher reputation - possibly more sells because of these<br />- shipping from different locations<br />- if cannabis supplies are low, growers can form a group, have a bigger stock while still remaining legit. (for ex: if growing 10 cannabis plants are allowed by law, 3 individuals can grow 30 plants thereby having 3 times more in stock and still remain legit by the law)<br /><br />cons:<br />- if sellers have the same product, they have to : <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - share the profit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - keep track of sells on both sides, and have to decide who sends the package, this needs additional channels for coordination especially if more than 2 sellers involved.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br />- more frequent cashout needed (less money kept on the shared account is the better if one decides to run)<br />- they don&#039;t need to know each other as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Any thoughts?

				You&#039;ve brought up an incredibly poignant detail relating to the auctioning of seller accounts with this thread. Thanks.

				There are a few cons to it but I&#039;m sure if someone decides that they want to partner up it&#039;s full risk to each seller to make sure someone isn&#039;t ducking out with all of the cash, or changing the password on the other guy.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible, but it would be better to do it with someone you know (even if it&#039;s through here or OVDB) than a complete stranger who is just setting up a decent bait and snatch.

				GreenCo is a cooperative with several members. The continuous supply and the continuous demand that goes with it is our main reason for teaming up. The smaller quantities that are popular on Silk Road is not their main focus but I am trying to get other members more interested and grow that part. Silk Road is a lot of work and has not a super great money maker but having people to share the work with is a huge plus. Only a few of us can log onto the Silk Road account and we share responsibilities. Replying to messages is pretty time consuming. If only one guy had to log in twice a day, it would suck. Everyone needs days off. We have all known an worked with each other for decades so the trust bit is pretty established, but I imagine that would be the biggest con. We have endured though marriages, divorcees, births, and deaths but partnering up, especially involving drugs and money is very hard on most people.

However, I am going to continue to work with others in the future because of the many benefits. It is easier to work with customers because there is almost always someone around. It is easier to gain more and new connections with wholesalers because you can approach them with the person most suited to work with them. If I ever decide to sell on SR, I would plan on it being with multiple people, sourcing product from multiple places, etc, simply because that way you have someone to get your back.
