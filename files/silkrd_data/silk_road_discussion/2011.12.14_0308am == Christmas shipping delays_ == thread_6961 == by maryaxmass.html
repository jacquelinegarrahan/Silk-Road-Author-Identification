				As soon as my bitcoins hit my account, I will be making my first purchase on SR. I&#039;m a bit nervous though, because of the season. I&#039;m guessing things should arrive as they are supposed to, just possibly/probably delayed? <br /><br />Can anyone who was around for the holidays last year share what their experiences were with how holiday shipping worked out for them? Thanks!

				I may be wrong, but SR hasn&#039;t been around for that long.&nbsp; So this is a new experience for everyone thus it will be hard to gauge the shipping times during the holidays.&nbsp; <br />My .2 BTC is that you purchase from a respected vendor and wait :S

				The thing is mate, whether your ordering off Amazon, Ebay or Silk Road expect some sort of delay of a couple of days.<br /><br />If I was in your shoes or had the choice I would go for some sort of tracked/recorded/signed for/express shipping option in case it gets lost or &quot;lost&quot; (lol) in the mail system.<br /><br />Also if your going to order, order tomorrow as a cutoff point (fri 16th) to be sure without rubbing it in too much I did my &quot;last orders&quot; on 9th of december but then again I am in the UK...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know where you are based, or the vendors your planning to order from but that put that in your calculation too and you should be cool.<br /><br />hope that helps!<br />

				I just made my first purchase as well and am expecting some delays myself. Usually things are delivered pretty fast to my area, but during the holidays things seem to take an extra day or two. This could be longer depending on he population of your area.

				I was planning on making my first purchase soon, and was wondering whether the holiday season would mean a higher or lower percentage of packages were screened? I assume fewer, due to a much greater flow of traffic?<br /><br />It probably wont matter anyway as i plan to order from abroad and I think it will be after xmas by the time it reaches the UK

				postal workers are underpaid government slaves. you think they bring them in stools and hot cocoa for the holiday rush season? They dont have time to check packages. but they do throw them extra hard this time of year.

				reporting in to say that there&#039;s definitely a huge delay going on right now.<br /><br />I have a shipment coming from literally 100 miles away, and it went out on monday. <br /><br />The DCN just started tracking it. <br /><br />Expected delivery is Saturday.<br /><br />6 days to travel 100 miles.<br /><br />So yeah... delivery time is fucked right now... best avoid shipping the smelly stuff IMO.

				Delays, but your stuff coming from international is probably a lot less likely to be discovered......since they are over run.<br /><br />Silver lining.&nbsp;

				Shipping times definetely seem to be slightly slower. Also in my country(NZ) there is no mail been sent 25th-27th. Have had package from amsterdam 2 days later than usual and one on it&#039;s way from usa 3 days late.
