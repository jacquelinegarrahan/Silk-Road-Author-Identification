Please contact an admin, this needs to end. I hadn&#039;t put much thought into it, but now that i have, i can see a mods power here is severely limited, which is why this problem is hard to tackle. I think at this point we need actual power(management) engaging the community to solve the problem, because as it is, nothing is working, and the newbie forum backlash is no fun. We need to implement a few word bans, and account bans. We also need to deputize a few more hero members into mod staff that maraud around the forums in shifts so we always have a mod on duty. We need the forums to be as well oiled as the main site, because this is truly the second resource a member will turn to if they can&#039;t find something on the main site. More so than the wiki. This forum should be what it was designed to be and how it functioned before i got here, along with the hordes. Careful policy changes that aren&#039;t harmful will only be good for everyone

				This can be resolved with a simple change in administrative privileges for mods.<br /><br />If there is unambiguous spamming or scamming, then mods should have the power to ban the username. Make it so.
