				hey everyone, ive discovered all of this a few monthes ago and up until then have just been a casual lurker, i have decided to become a member of the forum and of SR itself and was wondering if i could get some help. Im pretty sure i got alot of the stuff here down on what to do for the most part but a few things REALLY confuse me and if i could get a little help i would be really appreciative of that<br /><br /><br />1. I want to buy some Bitcoins but honestly it looks so confusin i dont even know where to begin&nbsp; :-\ ..if someone could maybe help me out a little in explaining all this it would really be great and i would appreciate it<br /><br /><br />2. Im finally starting to grasp the PGP thing here, you can tell me if im wrong but so far what i beleive it is is basically something to use in messages and things like that to sort of encrypt the message so only the sender and receiver know what is being discussed, but i have no idea how to use it or implement it into my messages, any help on this would also be very very appreciative as honestly i have no idea what the hell to do and its pretty confusing and intimidating. <br /><br /><br /><br />thanks everyone and anyone who might come across this and read this. have a good night everyone.

				check out the wiki which will cover most of what you need to know including btc and pgp<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />for bitcoins if you are in the US check out bitinstant.com. just deposit at a bank to fund your mt gox account (dont access through tor or mt gox will lock you out) after purchasing on mt gox send the coins through an intermediary to help make them more difficult to track such as&nbsp; to instawallet.org then another instawallet you only access through tor at a minimum (better would be to mix/tumble but longer and more charges) then from there send to SR

				thank you micro for taking time out of your night/day to give me a hand, i have done alot a reading (althought prob not enough) becasue i dont know how these thins work. its just the whole idea of the bitcoins and pgp really confuse me, i am pretty technically inclined but i wouldnt call myself very computer savvy. i will do some more reading tomorrow when&nbsp; i get time, and thank you again for giving me a hang, it is very much appreciated<br /><br />if anyone else has any advice or suggestions to make this process a bit easier or at least more understanding, again, it would be very much appreciated. thanks again<br /><br />-alaska

				I use bitinstant. Just click the first link in the drop down box &quot;major bank branch&quot; and then &quot;bitcoin address&quot;. I did an instawallet address that I bookmarked and saved to a file just in case. That should bring you to trustcash website, put your local zip, pick a location, put fake name and a Tormail email account if you want. Once you do the deal at the bank, your coins should be in the wallet in 1-3 hours. It may take longer though, but thats how long mine took. Then I transfered over to SR from the instawallet. Took a few hours for it to show up on SR also. <br /><br />Some people also go the route before sending to SR, where you &quot;tumble&quot; it. Basically use a website like bitcoin fog and then you sporadically get your coins over 6 hours (minimum). The tumbler is 100% safe I believe. I didn&#039;t use it, but I feel it is definitely worth it to if you are exceptionally paranoid or making huge purchases. Remember everybody takes fees from the BTC. Bitinstant, bitcoin fog, SR takes some fees from vendors which raises prices a bit.
