				Just wondering.&nbsp; I don&#039;t fully understand how the block chain and BTC addresses work as well as some people here and was under the impression that if I refresh my wallet every time I send BTC to my SR account that it will help obfuscate the connection between my BitFloor account (or coinapult, etc) and my SR account / wallet.<br /><br />Can someone shed some light on this?&nbsp; It is somewhat risky because if I ever send funds and accidentally hit that &quot;refresh wallet&quot; button then the funds will be sent to a random wallet and I would lose the coins, right?

So I think the coins still go to your account even if you refresh your wallet.

				Its worth refreshing, or rather replacing, your SR wallet periodically just so that all links with &amp; ties to other wallets - which could potentially be compromised or traced via blockchain - are gone. Mostly it&#039;s just peace of mind mixed with a bit of paranoia.<br /><br />Its worth regularly replacing any wallets, SR, online or wallet.dat that you use to channel money to SR just to break the chain leading from the BTC purchase to your SR purchases. <br /><br />Might not be necessary but its worth doing anyway just incase.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know if funds would find you or not, I just take care not to change wallets when I&#039;m waiting for money to arrive.
