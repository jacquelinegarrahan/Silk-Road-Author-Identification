				Hello SRers. I just ordered 72 BTC worth of psychedelics and heroin. I got a lil left over. I was wondering, would anyone want this for free?<br /><br />It is 2.77 BTC.<br /><br />I can give it too someone who can write the best short story (hint: I like ancient myths, fables, and greek mythology type of stories. doesnt have too be that though, I like everything)<br />I also like witty things.<br /><br />BUTTT: you must write it yourself!!! no copying!!!

				True story: (I shit you not)<br /><br />A few years ago, I moved into a really nice apartment with two of my friends. This pad was luxurious beyond our wildest dreams and certainly not anything we would be accustomed to living in. <br />We decided to have a house-warming party and we felt it needed to be a blow out party since it was such a flashy apartment.<br /><br />So, we went all out and organized DJs and a VJ (visual jockey) to project images onto one of the walls. The party was nothing short of epic...until I broke out the Dalai Lama acid trips. We&#039;re talking 220ug.<br /><br />In terms of the crowd that was at the party; it was a mixed crowd - some heavy enough drug users, some that would take the odd pill or two and some who were dead against drugs altogether. <br /><br />Anyway, I gave a trip to a guy who had never done acid before. No amount of warning him about how strong the Dalai Lama trips were, could convince him to take anything less than a full tab. So anyway, an hour later, he was telling me the trips were shit and that they weren&#039;t working. Someone else gave him a line of MDMA and told him to be patient. The party went on and everyone was having a great time....<br /><br />BOOM...the trips were working for this guy and he was having the time of his life. He loved the music, he loved the people, he loved the girls, basically, he loved everything. He sat down on the couch and started getting immersed in the visuals that the VJ was playing and he was quite content.<br /><br />An hour later, I was wondering where he was. I walked into the kitchen area to see if I could find him and he was standing there taking a shit on my kitchen floor. He obviously put his hand near the shit and he then leaned up against the wall, leaving a big shitty hand print on our wall!<br /><br />Needless to say, that was the end of the party as everyone freaked out! I tried to lighten the mood, but everyone was freaked out by the party poooper! :)

				I&#039;d been following leads for days, hoping to catch a break.&nbsp; It was out there somewhere, it had to be.&nbsp; Persistance and determination would lead me to it, perhaps a little luck too.&nbsp; I took another quick look at the current crop of candidates for perhaps the fifteenth time, smoke from the joint between my teeth swirling lazily past the brim of my fedora, towards the lamp above my head.<br /><br />I started when I heard the footsteps on wet pavement behind me and slunk a little deeper into the shadows.&nbsp; Could it be the law dogging my heels?&nbsp; I waited, trying to catch a glimpse of whoever approached, each approaching step sounded like tolling of a bell.&nbsp; When the revelation came it was not some flat-foot, she was a dame like no other I had seen in these parts.&nbsp; I knew who she was, though, everyone did, there was no other dame so Tall or so Tempting.&nbsp; For a moment I considered stepping out and introducing myself, but then I remembered the work that brought me this far.&nbsp; With a sigh and another toke I watched as she walked on by and stepped through a drape-covered doorway.<br /><br />Silence descended around me and I slipped out of my position, aiming to get a little closer.&nbsp; Would tonight be the night?&nbsp; Or did I have many more nights such as this ahead of me?&nbsp; I moved towards another alcove and was almost there when I heard a rumbling behind me.&nbsp; I dived into the shadows of the alcove just as the auto rounded the corner, the white landrover was unmistakable with the personalised plates reading &quot;LMTLSS&quot; and the awesome knowledge of who the driver must be.<br /><br />Only when it passed did I realise I&#039;d lost the reefer in the dash for cover.&nbsp; I fumbled with the cigarette case for another, I needed that sweet Acapulco scent to calm my nerves.&nbsp; I knew the light from my match could give my position away no matter how much I attempted to conceal it, but I had to take the chance.&nbsp; My heart was beating like a trip-hammer and I couldn&#039;t operate like that.<br /><br />I held my position and watched as more people approached the building across from me from every different direction.&nbsp; Some of them were known to me from previous encounters, some had pointed the way for me and others I&#039;d pointed the way for.&nbsp; I noted the arrival of Shannon, Skippy_Jif, Vlad1m1r and others.&nbsp; I almost missed Guru, so well had he disguised himself.&nbsp; Still they came and still I waited.<br /><br />Should I dart across there now?&nbsp; The silence had fallen again and the shadows were deep.&nbsp; I was sure I was the only one left on this misty street, we&#039;d all taken enough precautions to avoid the detection of the law and their paid stooges.<br /><br />I took a breath and braced myself to step out, when a lithe figure in a black mask stepped to my side.&nbsp; The joint fell from my lips to hiss out on the pavement.<br /><br />I gazed, speechless at the man in black.<br /><br />&quot;Come, join us.&quot; said The Dread Pirate Roberts, &quot;this is what you have been looking for.&quot;<br /><br />We crossed the Road, side-by-side and stepped through the Silken doorway as the shadows became a whisper of a memory behind me.<br /><br />***<br /><br />SR Noir by LouisCyphre<br /><br />Hope you enjoyed it.&nbsp; :)<br />

				For Andrew, it was his last time dealing with the unscrupulous dealers that loitered across the street. He was tired of associating with felons who had Shaquille O&#039;Neal length criminal records and didn&#039;t mean weed when they talked about &quot;rolling up with some AK47&#039;s&quot;. At the same time, his coke addiction had gone too far- In between getting burned or buying straight drywall, half of his paycheck was going towards low quality street coke which barely offered a buzz in a small line. After work last night he stayed up snorting line after line, and then searching his carpet for any granules of coke that fell off the table in the process of dividing up. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;This will be the last time.&quot; Andrew thought to himself as he slapped hands with a dealer named Coco, a dude fresh off parole wearing a black hoodie and golden hoop earrings obviously intended for a woman. Andrew didn&#039;t dare say anything of the sort. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What you need, Doo?&quot; said Coco.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I got 40&quot;, said Andrew, as he slapped the wadded up bills into the hand of the dealer, the other hand making contact with what felt like a small plastic bag. Andrew tossed the bag down his boxers and scurried off towards his building across the street.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The last time...&quot; he told himself aloud, beginning to untie the bag before he even entered the lobby. He put a little bit of the powder onto his pinky and licked it curiously: There was a slight bitterness and the definite taste of baby laxative. It would have to do.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He ran up the stairs, knowing that after this bag held off the craving, everything would be different. As he opened the door to floor 4, right outside his apartment, #20, he saw it: A nondescript package lay slanted against the metal door, inscribed &quot;To: Andrew Booth. From: Utrecht, Netherlands&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He tore open the package before even entering the apartment: He had to search, but concealed within were two small packages: one gram of the purest looking cocaine he had ever seen, and one other package, a small brown powder labeled &quot;Ibogaine&quot;.<br />&nbsp;&quot;The last time&quot;, Andrew said, grinning ear to ear.<br />

				this is the fable I remember when&nbsp; I was a kid, was something like this..<br />Zeus, the God of all nature who rules from the Olympus one day did an announcement of a competition for all the animal kingdom.<br />The most handsome child of all animals was going to be selected by him and will be rewarded..<br />It was there when Ms monkey came and present her child, a scary hairless with flat nose baby monkey as the candidate to win the price.<br />as you can imagine all the animals who were there starting to laugh about him and make fun of the ugly little monkey..<br />Suddenly Ms monkey shout loud to stop the laughs and then she proudly said, &#039;I do not know if Zeus will put his award on my son, but I know very well, at least in my eyes, his mother, he is the dearest, the most handsome and beautiful of all . <br />Moral of the fable:<br />We must always be proud of what we love, and have no shame in publishing it.<br /><br />hope you like it

				Ha, No way thanks much man. Total shot in the dark, but damn thanks this is awesome. <br />The btc went through right away<br /><br />The Albatross<br />An arrogant great albatross seeking to have distinction among his peers set out to achieve just that. The albatross took to the skies as soon as the sun show. Powerful he appeared in the skies with the jet black trailing edges of his wings shimmering as he faded from view into the rising sun.&nbsp; The young and powerful albatross had told his peers he would bring back the biggest fish by the end of the day. Confident in his abilities he pompously set to the sky resenting the discouragement from his peers. His peers had known the young albatross lacked discipline, and had routinely abstained from the, often demanding, training and exercise routines. These fundamental activities were passed down for generations, and taught to every new sea-faring albatross each year by the elders.<br /><br />By mid-day the albatross had visited many islands and took many dives. This yielded large fish but none satisfied the albatross, who eagerly wanted to ensure he would bring home the biggest fish. The albatross made his attempts more frequent, and was drinking more sea water. The elders warned the body is only so good at removing the salt from sea water. One must condition their body to remove salt over time, and develop the necessary endurance and stamina. By sundown the albatross was struggling to take to the air unlike his peers, who coast the well known air currents saving their energy to hunt in bountiful areas. The albatross had visited remote stretches not often as visited allowing older, larger, and stronger fish to prosper. <br /><br />As it was nearing down the albatross struggled to see in the dim light. He had finally spotted the perfect fish to bring home become distinguishable among his peers. The albatross struggled and fought in a thrashing skirmish with the fish. The albatross landed a crushing blow with his large hooked mandible, and then dragged the fish to the coast. Worn down the albatross drank mightily from the beach trying to rehydrate. Then he took to the sky with his fish to show his peers. The albatross was struggling to carry the fish, and severely dehydrated from lacking the necessary conditioning to remove enough salt from the sea water. Seconds later the albatross dropped the fish into the sea. At this point the Albatross was sensible enough to try to make it home rather than retrieve the fish. Moments later he himself fell into the sea<br />
