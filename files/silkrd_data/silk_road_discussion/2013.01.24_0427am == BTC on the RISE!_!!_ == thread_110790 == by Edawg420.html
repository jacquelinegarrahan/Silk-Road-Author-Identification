				WTF is going on with BTC&#039;s ???? Did the SR finally snowball over society???&nbsp; If SR were to go down i believe the BTC would CRASH...or at least take a severe dip in value....anybody know wtf is up?<br /><br />they were at 16 bucks 3 days ago....way less a week before that too.....they are spiking...IMO invest time...

				BTC are used in many more places than just SR.. I use them to gamble all the time on several different sites and there are plenty of other things you can do with them.. I bought almost 2000$ worth when they were still a lil under 10.00 back around september and have been sitting on them just watching the money roll in.. I suspect they will continue to rise until about two weeks after april 15th and everybody has spent all their &quot;extra money&quot; from income tax and then I will cash in and probably profit at around 3-4 times what I paid in I suspect.. Buy now if you have not.. I bet they will top around 30-40 before they start to drop again..

				Absolutely amazing but right now last price is $18.51 with a high of $19.00<br /><br /><br />Three weeks ago it was 13.50ish<br /><br /><br />Amazing... but the prices on SR still stay steady I see? Right? Will vendor drop their prices because of this absurd rise?<br /><br />That&#039;s something I love about SR

				Some posts I found on why it may be raising so drastically, especially the last three weeks <br /><br />which has gone from $13.60 to about $18.00 in 21 days!!!<br /><br /><br />https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2012/06/paul-graham-endorses-bitcoin/<br /><br />http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2012/08/silk-road-bitcoin-illegal.html<br /><br />

				pretty sure you set a price in USD for products on vendors pages, and SR adjusts the listings depending on the BTC value....

				Over $19 now!&nbsp; As I said in another thread, does anyone think it will drop a bit in the next week or so?&nbsp; Or should I jump on the boat now before they skyrocket some more?!

				Bleh I&#039;m so reluctant to place large orders. I&#039;m sitting on quite a coin stash at the moment... Made a couple grand these last couple days and am trying to decide the ideal time to place my bulk orders... Wish I had 30 grand I could just invest into bitcoin right now. I don&#039;t know shit about speculating, but this is one of those things with so much potential! And if they start dropping in value rapidly, then fuck it ill just place some bulk orders before I lose too big ;D Totally worth the risk.... Now where to find another 30 grand....

				Apparently the rate at which miners can mine coins has halved recently or something. PLUS there is a fixed number of coins in the system unlike normal currencies so the same number of physical coins is going to have to be spread among a larger number of people. This isnt a problem as btc are divisible to like 6 decimal places I think so in future a lot of transactions will simply be involving far less btc. <br />If btc were traded on a normal platform or followed the way normal securities behave (which im not saying they dont, maybe they do?) Then around now ib be paying very close attention to the rate ready to cash out. Things that go up will normally come down but with bitcoins who knows. Based on the theory eventually no more btc can be mined leaving the system with its max number of btc, provided the system isnt abandoned or compromised theoretically the rate would never fall until we hit peak bitcoin usage (ie when theres as many ppl using btc as will ever use it=peak demand) until this point demand will always be on the increase. Peak btc usage or saturation has got to be a long way off so by this logic you should keep speculating on them for some time yet. <br />HOWEVER dont take anything iv said as truth as it could callapse as yet another bubble<br /><br />UPDATE: After checking my local method the price was £12.04 last night today right now its 10.92. Make of that what you will. Not necessarily time to sell but keep an eye on it
