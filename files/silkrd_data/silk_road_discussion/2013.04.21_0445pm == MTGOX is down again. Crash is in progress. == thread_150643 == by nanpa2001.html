To afraid to loose a few 100 dollars.<br />When you are here on SR selling or buying one time you win some....other time you loose some.<br />In a year time you will see that it all was sorta ok and that you in fact did not win much or loose much.<br />If you are dealing with coins and your life sort of depends on it.....quit!!<br />Never gamble more than you can afford to loose !!!

				MtGox survived it&#039;s second significant DDOS in three days without crashing. Maybe if the market manipulators don&#039;t get what they want, they will finally give up.<br />

				MtGox has a too big monopoly.<br /><br />Will do the other exchanges some good.<br /><br />Probably even the litecoin too.<br /><br />What&#039;s bad for MtGox is bad for the bitcoin too.<br /><br />Every other exchange that has a problem is never going to make a difference on the pricerate of the btc.<br /><br />Probably, not even been noticed and or mentioned.<br /><br /><br />I am going to look at the litecoin.<br />It&#039;s time for a closer inspection...

Luckily it was down long, or it may have crashed like it did last week. As it was, it lost 20% of it&#039;s value in 30 minutes, a number not reflected in the above because MTGOX was not online.<br /><br />Still, isn&#039;t it crazy to have to worry about wild swings like this? We really do need to use something with a flat value.
