				Im sure that is what his cellmates will say :()<br /><br />DPR or who ever they got anyway.<br /><br />Still in all this I cant believe this guys did not have a back up server after all the security talk and tips he gave out lol thats sad and why on earth not release btc to emergency accounts, people are going to die who owe a lot of money because of that fuck up he made. <br /><br />Everyone should be nice to him and send some vaseline to him in prison if SR owes you money while he is in there, i mean that the only thing we can do :)<br /><br />If the site didnt go down and backup was in place cops would have very little proof he is DPR, which again is his fuck up.<br /><br />
