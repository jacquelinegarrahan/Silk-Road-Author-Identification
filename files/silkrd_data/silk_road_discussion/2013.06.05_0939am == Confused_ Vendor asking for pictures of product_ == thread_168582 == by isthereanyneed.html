				I am pretty confused at the moment, I got an order through from an O/S vendor for 20 grams of hash and it was short by 8 grams, I contacted the vendor immediately to tell him that my order arrived but was missing 8 grams but the other 12 grams arrived ok.<br /><br />I have not Finalized the order yet because it is not all here.<br /><br />The vendor has said sorry and that he will fix this problem but has said I need to send him a picture of the hash to confirm my order?

He is a well respected vendor with over 1 year on sr and in top 3 % of vendors.<br />I just dont see how me sending a picture of the product will help, maybe he got confused some how, hope he sees sense and sorts this out it would be a shame on all counts to end up dragging this out.<br /><br />I have messaged vendor to tell him to reship or refund.<br />Will update when I know more.

				How would a photo prove he was telling the truth, sure it could be useful in the case of wrong product sent but it&#039;s be easy for someone claiming only half the order arrived to simply take the full order that arrived and take half of it out of the packaging. That is hypothetical only assuming the buyer wasn&#039;t honest that is. Can&#039;t really see how a picture would help in your situation.

If it doesn&#039;t make sense no worries, was just my first thought!<br /><br />A friend of mine is a vendor on SR and he deals with product distribution whereas another deals with the online/customer service/etc so it could even be that the go-to response for an incorrect order is &quot;please send a picture&quot;. Who knows! <br /><br />Take a pic, strip it of EXIF data, upload to Onion service and send it with URL encrypted with PGP if it helps your transaction move along. If you&#039;re uncomfortable with that, take to resolution centre. Sounds like a weird request but if the vendor is gonna be awkward then those are your options.<br /><br />ER.

				@ OP<br /><br />I think this is a reasonable request from the vendor. You can safely and anonymously send him a photo of the product and package. They probably asked to view the package to confirm they sent you the wrong package. Many vendors like myself package larger orders using different materials so there would be a purpose in the vendor viewing the photo.

				You need to remove the meta data that&#039;s attached to digital photo&#039;s -&nbsp; WARNING - CLEARNET LINK FOLLOWS ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_removal_tool ) .<br /><br />Then you can upload it an .onion image uploader ` like this one http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/ or this one&nbsp; http://i7hknwg4up2jhdkx.onion/ .<br /><br />Then send them the link to the image .<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying to disregard libertas&#039;s advice however - but that&#039;s how you would do it , if you wanted to .
