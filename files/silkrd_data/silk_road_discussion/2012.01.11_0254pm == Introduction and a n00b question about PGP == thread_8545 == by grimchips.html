				Hello, SR forum!<br /><br />I&#039;m new here, so I thought I would poke my head in and look around. I&#039;m still trying to figure out how to use PGP and Bitcoins. (I haven&#039;t signed up for either yet.) I have a couple questions:<br /><br />Do I need to have a program saved on my computer to use PGP? If so, is it a security risk to have it saved on my primary personal computer? (Right now I&#039;m running a TOR browser through a Linux distro on a USB drive that I have plugged into a separate netbook that I can easily throw into a fire if I need to. I don&#039;t fuck around.) I read a how-to guide and it sounded like I need to install it on the same computer that I browse SR on, because I need to somehow integrate it with my keyring. But I have no clue how to do that, so any advice would be appreciated.<br /><br />- Grim

				Hi,<br /><br />no it is absolutely not necessary to run gpg (the opensource variety of pgp) on the same computer as the browser you access SR with. You can do that, it might not even be a bad idea to keep you keyring on the USB-Stick, but it is not strictly necessary.<br /><br />SR/Tor/GPG are not connected. Tor is a systrem of peer-to-peer exchanges that know only their immediate peers and encrypt traffice between them, to give you some anonymity. SR is a &quot;normal&quot; webserver that is only reachable (well, sort of) via Tor, and GPG/PGP is a method to encrypt messages. You can use all of them independently.<br /><br />Yes, you need a program to use gpg, it is called &quot;gpg&quot; ;) Try to search for it in your packet-manager (synaptics, if you are using Ubuntu).<br />If you have that and still have questions, feel free to ask me, I am using gpg on the commandline, too.<br /><br />You will probably want some anonymous email service, too, loike hushmail.com or tormail.com (and there are a lot more).<br /><br />Using GPG is a REALLY GOOD idea! Not only that an in-between party (like the mailserver, SR, etc.) can read your message (e.g. address details), but you can also be sure that only the intended receiver can decrypt the message. So if you inadvertently send some secret data to the wrong recipient there is no harm done, as he cannot decrypt them anyway!<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br /><br />Stephe

				Hey guys, I know this is a old ass thread, but I figured I&#039;d resurrect it to introduce myself (I really don&#039;t want to be a stranger around here).&nbsp; My name is Eternal Sunshine Man.&nbsp; But you can call me &quot;Day man, fighter of the Night man, champion of the sun, Master of karate and friendship for everyone&quot; for short.&nbsp; Or just ESM or Sunshine if that&#039;s easier.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a young IT professional with a good job, a beautiful girlfriend, a great family, and a fantastic life.&nbsp; I pay my bills, I pay my taxes, I have my own house, my own car, and a few animals I&#039;ve rescued.&nbsp; I work out 4-5x a week, I don&#039;t eat GMO food, I don&#039;t litter, and I support local business and fight global conglomerates, imperialism, corporatization, &amp; oppression (I&#039;m a avid progressive civil libertarian &amp; local activist). I don&#039;t cheat on my girlfriend (anymore), and I don&#039;t even fucking speed (honestly)... I also take real good care of my friends.&nbsp; And I work.....my..... mutha.....fuckin..... ASS OFF (like 12 hour days, its ridiculous)..................oh yeah, I also prefer heroin to scotch.&nbsp; Does that make me a bad person? (if you said yes, than fuck you.&nbsp; That was a rhetorical question dick).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m an opioid man...long time user...very experienced...and I hope to contribute to the opioid community, and really to any SR community for that matter, as much as I can. And though my love is opioids, I do have experience with everything under the sun.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I can add to any discussion anywhere if only at the very least I offer some ridiculous humor.&nbsp; And please, feel free to tell me to shut the fuck up anytime (like now for instance)...I&#039;m not shy, and I love some ball breaking.&nbsp; So if I start popping off on some stupid shit, tell me..Please! Don&#039;t ever hesitate to tell me if I&#039;m being a dumbass, or how you feel.&nbsp; I&#039;m a newb, and I&#039;m here to learn.&nbsp; So teach away!&nbsp; Thanks guys for listening, and I hope this intro is well received and that we all have a long and fruitful relationship in the SR community!<br /><br />My left nut is itchy!!!!
