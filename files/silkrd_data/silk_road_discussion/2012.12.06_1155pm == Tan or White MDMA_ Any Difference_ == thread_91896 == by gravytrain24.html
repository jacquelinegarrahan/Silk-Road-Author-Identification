				IÂ´m interested to hear what people have to say about this too. In me and my friends experience its difficult to tell the difference, if there is any.

				From what i&#039;ve read and experienced it&#039;s just the wash, and the color is no real indication of the quality (or authenticity) of the mdma.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had some weak white and some strong tan, and vice versa of course.

				I thought people did acetone washes to purify the mdma even more. but then I&#039;ve heard rumors that &quot;tan is stronger than white&quot;. I&#039;m confused, too! ???

				All of the real MDMA you get is going to give you the same effects.&nbsp; The difference is that one MDMA might be 70% and another might be 80%.&nbsp; So you&#039;ll need a little more of the 70% one but it isn&#039;t like MDMA #1 causes a bodyload while MDMA #2 is more euphoric.<br /><br />Pure MDMA hcl (when we say MDMA we&#039;re talking about MDMA hcl) is clear/white.&nbsp; That means that tan MDMA isn&#039;t 100% sure.&nbsp; But it might be 99.9% pure.&nbsp; Or maybe it is 80% pure.&nbsp; Just a little bit of an impurity can significantly change the color.<br /><br />The tan color usually comes from the safrole.&nbsp; You can smell it.&nbsp; The safrole isn&#039;t going to give you any MDMA effects but it is an indication that you&#039;re getting real MDMA.&nbsp; You can also smell the safrole.<br /><br />So is white MDMA 100% pure?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; There are a lot of impurities that are also white/clear.

It was white/grey-ish 83%. It was one of the best mdma crystals my friend has had in many years.<br />I&#039;ve had some tan ones sometimes. Not 83% but also not bad. <br /><br />I do not think the color of the mdma tells you anything about the percentage of purity...<br /><br />

				It&#039;s just the wash. Very similar with DMT too, the strongest I&#039;ve ever had was tinted just a little bit golden yellow.

				The tan stuff has some impurities, but not much in my experience. Probably less than 5% and not worth an acetone wash. If you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing, you&#039;ll lose more product in the wash.
