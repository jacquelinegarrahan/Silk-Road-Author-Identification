				Anyone have experience and personal feedback on polygmuz for mdma, within US shipping, and quality?&nbsp; Also, and good recommendations for LSD vendors within the USA?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had less than satisfactory experiences using vendors from outside the US, and am looking for a good solid mdma/lsd troll for old times sake.<br /><br />Thanks for your advice in advanced.<br /><br />DSB

Bought a gram of MDMA from him, was WAY higher quality than the shit my friend got from his friend for 110 a gram. His communication was excellent, very quick response time. He&#039;s pricey, but god damn is he professional. His packaging was a business letter as described, very stealthy. I would recommend him if you wanted to go domestic

				I&#039;ve already received 2 orders from polygamuz and both were well packaged with good stealth. The MDMA definitely lived up to his description, everyone that has tried it swears that it&#039;s the best Molly they ever had. I would definitely recommend working with him and ordering. Quick, stealthy and a good product. And good communication as well.
