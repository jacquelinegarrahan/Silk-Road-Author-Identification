				It&#039;s probably just someone spending their spare coin from a larger order.<br /><br />A lot of times when I have a few btc left over from a order, I&#039;ll make a order for a pill of some sort I normally wouldn&#039;t purchase because all the prescription drugs are so over priced on sr.

				Okay, I do like to play Devil&#039;s Advocate sometimes. Suppose this buyer is LE (Law Enforcement?) what&#039;s the harm? <br />Can you be &quot;traced&quot; somehow? Might they be trying for fingerprints on the goods or inside the package?<br />Could you be incriminated in any way?<br /><br />As googleyed1 said, reiterating; suspect EVERY package/order from any buyer even if he/she hash a 5 year, 10 000 transactions, 100% clean account.<br /><br />I have personally bought single tabs/pills from vendors in the past (2C-B caps instance, I bought only 1) because I&#039;m experimenting with various drugs for the first time, I&#039;m not going to buy 50 tabs of anything because if I&#039;m not going to like it, what then? I&#039;ll try it out first and if I like it, I&#039;ll buy bigger quantities. Actually, my first ever order on SR was for 50 Valium tabs, lol! But I think V&#039;s are the most inexpensive product on SR so that&#039;s the reason I bought so much without ever have tried it first. But I digress...<br /><br />Another thing I want to mention is that on SR, the ฿ currency is way better than the dollar/pound and I tend to buy things much more easily and almost never even consider postage as part of my &quot;drug deal&quot; <br /><br />But what is the risk? What would have happened if you did not cancel his order, took his money and sent him the 1 pill?<br /><br />

				Doesn&#039;t seem unusual to me....first time I placed an order here, I was pretty skeptical about the whole thing...so I only ordered one small item, which was definitely overpriced when you factored in the postage.&nbsp; I basically assumed that I was throwing away a bit of cash (around 20 bucks), but that maybe something would actually show up.<br /><br />When it actually did, I was pleasantly surprised, and placed bigger orders in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp; Speaking of the future , I like your profile picture&nbsp; 8)

				Ive done it before. I&#039;ve ordered a SINGLE pill before. 1) to test the vendor; 2) because I was still new and was freaking out about misdemeanor / felony charges if busted! remember, quantity does matter on the charge. Also, some people on here do have money and really couldn&#039;t care less about $16 shipping etc.<br />again, i&#039;ve purchased a single Oxy 80g pills before, and I am not a cop nor a journalist :-)

				I can&#039;t believe this is a thread and I can&#039;t believe 90% of the post since.<br /><br />How the fuck is the sketchy? Just someone wanting one pill. Big deal.

Or they have never tried it. <br /><br />There could be a lot of reasons but not one of them should sketch you out or scare you.( I still can&#039;t believe you put &quot;scared&quot;)<br /><br />As long as you have single pills available you will get orders for them. I have had orders for 2 Xanax bars ($10) and they paid for express ($28.00). People do strange things on here. You can always cancel on them. Not because it is suspicious but because you do not want to ship a single pill.<br /><br /><br /><br />But to be this paranoid and make a post about it is really ........DUMB.<br /><br /><br />And no... once again this is not LEO.<br /><br />0 for 1100 people<br /><br />
