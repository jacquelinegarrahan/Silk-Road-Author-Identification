				http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22381046<br /><br />taken from page.<br /><br />Dark web drugs site Silk Road knocked offline by hacker.<br /><br /><br />An &quot;underground&quot; website famed for selling drugs and other illegal items has been targeted in a cyberattack.<br /><br />It appears the site suffered from a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday.<br /><br />Silk Road is only accessible through Tor, a service which allows users to browse anonymously online.<br /><br />Several US politicians have called for the marketplace to be shut down, without success.<br /><br />DDoS attacks involve flooding a website with more traffic than it can handle, therefore knocking it offline.<br /><br />After two days of intermittent service, Silk Road&#039;s administrators told users on Wednesday morning the site was back in action - but said they could not rule out further downtime.<br /><br />&quot;Silk Road is open and accessible,&quot; said the site&#039;s administrator, writing under the user name Dread Pirate Roberts.<br /><br />&quot;As soon as the attacker finds out, he will likely change his tactics and try to take the site down again.<br /><br />&quot;Hopefully he won&#039;t be able to, but time will tell.&quot;<br /><br />Possible motives<br />Prior to the site&#039;s recovery, owners speculated that the attack had exposed deep-rooted vulnerabilities in the Tor network.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s looking more and more like a restructuring of the Tor software or even the Tor network will be required to mitigate the kind of attack we are under,&quot; one update read.<br /><br />Tor is a channel for people wanting to route their online communications anonymously.<br /><br />It has been used by activists to avoid censorship as well as those seeking anonymity for more nefarious reasons - leading it to be known as the &quot;dark web&quot;.<br /><br />Speculation has spread over possible motives for the attack - including the possibility that a competitor is looking to set up a rival site on the network.<br /><br />Silk Road takes its name from the historic trade routes spanning across Europe, Asia and parts of Africa.<br /><br />The website has gained a reputation as being an online black market, with illegal goods being sold openly.<br /><br />Carnegie Mellon University estimated that over $1.22m (Â£786,183) worth of trading took place on the site every month.<br /><br />Payments for goods are made with the virtual currency Bitcoin, making it hard to track users buying drugs.<br /><br />The website has been targeted by police in various countries - but still continues to operate.<br /><br />However, one Australian man using the site to sell drugs was arrested in February.<br /><br />In a statement, local police said the arrest proved they were &quot;one step ahead&quot; of criminals on online networks.<br /><br />

Giving credit where credit is due to DPR, and showing their spirit by fighting off this douche hacker.<br /><br />It&#039;s interesting they breached tor with DDOS, but hopefully they fix the bug and get everything figured out.

				Great,&nbsp; now any other hacker out there will see this as an easy target to test his botnet out on.&nbsp; <br />Anyone think it invites trouble?&nbsp; It woudn&#039;t if it said everything was fixed and all that, but it kinda says its still vulnerable.<br /><br />The ending is a h o o t !&nbsp; Police are one step ahead of us.&nbsp; &nbsp;mmmmmm, not quite, but low hanging fruit is always easy to reach for.&nbsp; . . Don&#039;t be easy to reach for and you will enjoy a great shopping experience here.<br /><br />Thank you for shopping at Silk Road.&nbsp; Parking is free.

				Roll with the punches guy. It&#039;s working as of right now. It could be a lot worse. DPR could just throw his hands in the air and say &quot;ok fuck this, too much trouble&quot; and vanish (WITH your BTC). Yet he wouldnt/won&#039;t/doesn&#039;t. He busts his ass round the clock to keep this place secure AND continue to give us updates (despite staying mum out of personal security consideration). Fuck it, we&#039;re up and running. Let&#039;s assume the best :)

It&#039;s just inviting the hackers to come attack for the publicity, and turning new people on to the site which will increase traffic and potentially cause more outages...<br /><br />And now the site is down again.....
