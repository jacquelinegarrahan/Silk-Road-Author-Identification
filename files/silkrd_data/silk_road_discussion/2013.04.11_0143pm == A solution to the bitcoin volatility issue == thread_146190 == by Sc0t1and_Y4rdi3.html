				I admit that I did take a tangent into the volatility issue (which is what I&#039;ve mostly been thinking about lately), but the point still remains that someone would have to be willing to take the risk to pay off the 50% drop and I&#039;m not sure an 8% fee would do that. Or ... the hedge could be run like AIG did in 2007-2008, just take the 8% and when the bill comes due, just say &quot;oh, too bad, I fucked up and I can&#039;t pay suckers!&quot;<br /><br />Seriously, though, the 50% that everyone lost yesterday (not just the vendors) was money that they gained in the few days prior. The only true short term exposure is in the bitcoins involved in transactions&nbsp; (you give me 1 bitcoin and I&#039;ll give you drugs that I paid $x for).

				Let&#039;s just run it as a ponzi scheme. By the time critical mass approaches and funds are about to run out the value of BTC should rise solving everything

				Fuck .<br /><br />1. Fake ID off Silk Road<br />2.&nbsp; Use it to open a bank account <br />3. Use it for PayPal and link to bank account <br />4. Use it for bit coin exchange verification<br /><br />Start taking western union money order/money gram / cash in mail via express post. <br />The risks are the same as bitcoin.&nbsp; If you know your customers and vendors its not so bad. <br /><br />You can also hire homeless people to run your risky errands for you. They gladly help.&nbsp; <br />Selling drugs is bad any way you look at it. Might as well also get the fake ID and people to do your dirty work for you.&nbsp; <br />Just a thought. <br /><br />With the fake ID you can cash out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Carders do it all the time. <br />
