				with SR going down im stuck with alot of product and I know 0 people in real life. I am willing to let my top shelf number 4 heroin go for just $170 per gram including USPS next day air shipping. Contact me I have packs ready to go all I need to do is put addresses on them. Your order will go out within 24 hours, I ship 6 days a week.<br /><br />I am a vendor of 1year 6month with 300+ Transaction 0% problems. I can assure you this is absolutely top shelf stuff. This H is uncut from the key and I just red-up and I only did a few deals before SR went down. Now I am more anxious in just offing it. I have a fair amount, but not a ton avaible ASAP. SUPER stealthy shipping, I spend approx $500 for several different machines I use to make the package and seal it along with very careful methods. All communications must be in PGP. If you dont use PGP you dont get an answer.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.21 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFIZVPsBCACZrliVkvXk4Rv3plLMJ15QXn6miXtzZa7LmPpwPpKFHyMpKnLl<br />jvYwAW7SDMlAIEd0ViP2+QdFelDjnUE5Wy17siGp5GvcsEzUUVo0G43QcytrDl5l<br />XNv9NwDiBFdjYNob+fri6yDsqwMdfQ26VCejcBRs6nRrr7hz9ZPGPxR7NbJu0VyJ<br />JC1OJ2rRZSlVcgqJwDxOwzhUSsrwqekaeE1rDJ75rAi9p1VsiMqx+U18liU5AdrS<br />vqwdwgdWUKhJ7ZUNWdC6i2h0UqL0ZC9pxn0SboQi7g2fNyKkfMcoDYgs5D/2FatT<br />XBHc2A23P52V2/UkVGaXmlkwlRTzgZHhJLafABEBAAG0IENhcG5KYWNrIDxDYXBu<br />SmFja0BDYXBuSmFjay5uZXQ+iQE5BBMBAgAjBQJSGVT7AhsDBwsJCAcDAgEGFQgC<br />CQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQxV5HorjMe3p/ZAgAl/ydgVxJIPByZ5v1Qc9F7mGJ<br />iIj9lKqkQj7IF0W8HVv2jQOiP/R4v0hiDAm7Cw7vupMF7x86/o9j6NSrdPA2wFLY<br />L2npD4zI3pJWI7hy4Q6NTPQjllakl0Ihk3CKkOKejEFn+G+gGUMNzh7pfDKhithL<br />AvF8Q0TsFqpEkouY9pSbsTgj6dSLkO8ukE3eKw2CAncgAq8DqmFDauYMnY/wFiK+<br />YbRWQQbr+6QYk8JNAEGwGs1kyQ8lxF0zylkJ+7ctfx0QEWkrfAL91/hG4S/8nKYh<br />PmmSSbUIhLLZ1sENRhoH2waoSwOHQIxT9i1lNwFfhdU8hWxPpJTZ2QS5Kx+wO7kB<br />DQRSGVT7AQgAqVMP5VCvroBUwaqeJ1rdxj6qEBkcQgLazSz9+qRAZegN5H3MuY6E<br />Uumy1lv3jwmurdS10Gmk7FTTPQCJCHZyjTKocLjYL3penbrFfe5Tc7it7F7X5Iz8<br />y5wkKS9CIJHPYcTuQSSRzOvz1bS9s+nuTf6RctdJNOp7sKat55inasVHjUm8oTny<br />jg1V3UL6EM3NMOzrUBComS7njK2lgE5f57ben2m8qakAMHSW0xPzv+9jvzdqJ9O5<br />zi9JQvNrvpX/6+eag6ydYE87Q0etmoJqTyx+YkyGnJVV7cOHL+oL7v+6mcxkOweH<br />iC5MpNrt5HpDyH+9eN5AZ0Srk6B9XSx2hQARAQABiQEfBBgBAgAJBQJSGVT7AhsM<br />AAoJEMVeR6K4zHt63ucH/3kV0vIi09jgcePjry83651/5/6qbaYKTFLDsZwoFxBM<br />4JTC0R8ywMJBHVT8x5lFbYcoPRpIqHA4DcNr7PjyRaf7eP68BDITvgkQPlTx75nS<br />0SONrFBl0+zDbM5NmyeD1dK9owSeEV9o9943SwhYv4KPvfTtxfFgdul6e+9XhLy+<br />rw32y4OjQrPuO2J7wxg6ob8iltPdmub1xoenGZzTQ/vX6XYVwbzdtYGL9bYerbSq<br />oCC/6LZaJ5/0qwMnfgbeiDYbUzrzV/0Hn0VwxCfCrPt5L0OU23uxgTEhGJsD1xTO<br />vPK8ESGDYfnZTPwnYGbJhwjxwX9y1cy6tJwa17s/MQs=<br />=rYkD<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />

				Ordered 3.5g of the top shelf number 4 for a really good price. payed on Thursday received&nbsp; Saturday. Ive been a customer of jacks for awhile and I just placed an order for 1g of H and received it before SR went down. Very haappy with the quality, tried a shot of about 60mg and I got a big time nod and Ive been buzzed as hell for about 3-4 hours. Jack said this stuff was top grade and he was right. Every product I have ever got from jack has been quality. His shipping methods are very stealthy, easily one of the most stealthy shippers on SR. The speed was very good like always as well. <br /><br />Thanks for the really good deal jack I appreciate it. When I get some more bitcoins I will throw you $50 since you said you lost all the money you had in escrow from my last order of 1g which I did receive but SR was seized so I couldnt finalize. Sorry about that jack but expect the money in about 4-5 days :)

				Thank you for your kind words. I can only hope that more of my customers review so that I can get what I have left moved. I dont have customers in real life for this H, it was all ear marked for SR so I really am looking for customers. If your interested in number 4 straight off the kilo and uncut shoot me a msg I already have the packs made up, I ship next day air, all bags are fat, you will get your stuff as fast as possible as I ship 6 days a week.

				you should start selling it on BMR. there are virtually no H vendors on there and a huge demand so if you signed up you would sell it all really fast. then your customers can stay in escrow and everyone is protected

But with SR ending i am not going 2 another site. and i certainly cant make any money selling at my current prices. I got this H specifically for SR as I dont know anyone in RL for this stuff. So now i am just trying to unload it and not so much worried about profits. I just want to get it all gone and go out with a bang.<br /><br />Any way if anyone is interested I already have several 1g packs made up all the need are address labels. I ship daily so you could have your stuff as fast as it could be done.<br /><br />I have a flawless reputation after 1year 6month and 300+ transaction all 100% satisfaction. I guarantee this H will blow your mind. I saw the guys from Canada charging $300g before for H and I know mine is just as good. <br /><br />So hit me up for a fat bag of H straight from the key cheap as it can be found considering this is a small quantity.
