				Can we please not have the &quot;crazies&quot; start up all their bullshit? Just this one time.... :)<br /><br />DPR is working on fixing the problem. He will get it fixed.

Just do anything BUT spread bullshit in the forums for no reason.<br /><br /><br /><br />To all the non - crazies...<br /><br />I think the site is fucked and DPR ran off with all the coin because of the recent hike in BTC rates. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:P

				No, no, there&#039;s just a glitch that needs to be taken care of so DPR pulled the site while he and the staff work on it.&nbsp; Nothing to worry about at all - just a technical issue, but all coins are safe.&nbsp;

				I heard the Department of State had a mole in DPR&#039;s neighborhood since last September, and when the GQ article hit, DEA agents were about to greenlight the operation that would culminate in this very shutdown, the one happening before our very eyes.<br /><br />If my sources are correct, all of our data is right now being sifted by the greatest minds in the DEA, the NSA, and the White House Special Counsel on Drug Violence, whoever the fuck that is, and they&#039;re going to decrypt everything.&nbsp; That&#039;s right.&nbsp; They are coming for you.<br /><br />Leave.&nbsp; Leave now.&nbsp; No time to take the kids.&nbsp; Get out.&nbsp; What are you waiting for, go!&nbsp; Go!!!

				A bright meteor was witnessed by many in Russia. - True Story. <br /><br />Servers being taken out by it? - No story - Conjecture. <br /><br />I&#039;d be more upset to find out SR was using servers in Russia!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />For the truth, rather than conjecture, read through ALL the posts on DPR&#039;s thread which explains EVERYTHING !!!<br /><br />KNOWLEDGE IS POWER - Wanna try some? <br />Here&#039;s the link;<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120741.0<br /><br />You&#039;re welcome.&nbsp; ;)

				Steal our money....<br /><br />A wise man once said lets not run down there and fuck one of those bitches while the others scatter lets stroll down and fuck them all.&nbsp; I am of the belief that it&#039;s in his best interest to not smash and grab but go for the long con and really clean up.
