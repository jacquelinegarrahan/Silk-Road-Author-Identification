				Verify what? It&#039;s just a new person calling himself Dread Pirate Roberts, has nothing to do with the old Silk Road. I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s the &quot;SR 2.0&quot; site?<br /><br />Edit: Reading that message properly I am now assuming that is not &quot;SR 2.0&quot; but the other project StExo was talking about, if so I indeed hope he can verify this is the real deal. :)

				StExo vouches for it. You won&#039;t find anything more about who&#039;s behind it though other than I&#039;m told it&#039;s people who were very connected to the original market. I have a big concern I&#039;ve voiced to the new DPR but for the time being, it&#039;s certainly something to watch.&nbsp;
