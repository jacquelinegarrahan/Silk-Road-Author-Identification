				It is astonishing how much people were using Silk Road in such a small population remote town.<br /><br />The other article you refer too is what caused this operation to begin with in the first place. An operation like this can be launched quite easily in any small remote town but would be much harder in cities with mass amounts of postal traffic. <br /><br /><br />

				exactly, kids got dobbed in by their mom she contacted the cops, cops launched &quot;Operation Cinder&quot; with auspost (who were also suspicious) and started to pickup on SR packages by inspecting the tiny amount each day, so they easily recognized the obvious ones. They plucked out and confiscated 30 packages some quite weighty by the look of it.<br /><br />To replicate this nationwide would need a massive allocation of money and people. Might happen, one day, but not yet.<br />

Esperance is pretty remote. There are few other viable options for obtaining drugs. <br /><br />2. It is home to a teen rehab centre that teens get sent to in order to get them out of the city and away from the temptation of drugs. Thats where Benny Cousins was headed when he was caught with a butt full of meth. What&#039;s the bet a lot of the packages were destined for there?<br />

				Oh really? They can recognize the which packages are drugs? Maybe thats why SR was worth 22 million dollars last year, because everyone is getting caught? HA! Just more SR publicity, why don&#039;t they just include a link to download the TOR browser and the silk road URL? <br /><br />Ah, the media and police are somewhat deluded in this town me thinks.

				I would also like to mention for every parcel the detectives came across immediate search warrants were issued. Apparently a parcel delivered to your address with your name or not is enough to get your house searched and all forms of privacy stripped away. <br /><br />It is safer having parcels intercepted at customs borderline rather then at your local post office.
