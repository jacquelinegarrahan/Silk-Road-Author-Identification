				I mean... really, how does that make sense? Aren&#039;t the guys taking all the meth supposed to have all that energy to burn? And the folks with their heroin...<br /><br />What kind of strange world is this?<br /><br />Enjoy your day, SR. :)

				Lol The heroin community is getting high and then we all get on teh forums and talk about how epic each high is so we all know whos heroin to buy! Meth heads are out breaking into family houses in broad daylight to steal the metal out of the house to sell it to a scrap yard so they can get enough bitcoins to buy their meth that must be why they need all that methy energy?<br /><br />haha but for real Heroin is a good drug to get really fucked up and it makes you really chatty lol that is why there are 100000x more posts in there then Meth in my humble opinion! :)

				i think it&#039;s because there&#039;s a lot more people who like heroin and opiates. and probably more people who dont know where to score h than meth

				We kind of post in bursts... meth users, that is.&nbsp; Actually I was surprised about this very same thing the first time I looked at the forum stat page.&nbsp; nosaj_thing may be right that heroine is more popular; it&#039;s usually the same dozen people posting again and again in the meth thread with an occasional new reviewer, if that&#039;s any evidence one way or another (never looked at the heroine pages and don&#039;t know how many people post regularly... opiates feel good but aren&#039;t my thing).
