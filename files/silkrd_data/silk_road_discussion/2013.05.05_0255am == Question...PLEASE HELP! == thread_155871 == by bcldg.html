				Hey guys..<br /><br />I am in the process of transferring some money to my SR account to make a purchase...I have my account set to show all prices and my account balance, etc in USD instead of BTC...now, I just transferred the coins I already had, and im waiting on the confirmation for some coins i&#039;ve transferred to a few other wallets before sending them here.<br /><br />The USD value SR is showing is about $80 off of its true value...is this some sort of temporary error or something? I have the correct amount of BTC that I sent here, but the USD value is waaaaaay off. Will this effect me from making my purchase since SR is giving me a much smaller value than what they are actually worth?

The SR price is currently accurate; however, you can use the following method to determine when the best time to place an order would be to get the most for your money:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138695.msg939652#msg939652<br /><br />Libertas

If you try a few times it&#039;ll usually go through.<br /><br />Libertas
