				Hi guys, newbie on SR, spent the last 3 days catching up on forum posts on stuff I am interested in and also Bitcoin (which I am familiar of anyway) and also PGP and security (I work in IT so am au fait with this and advocated it an makes me feel far better about things).<br /><br />My only two questions are and cannot find anything as still finding my way round is <br /><br />1) how is SR&#039;s commission calculated on purchases?&nbsp; Is there a wiki or link?<br />2) Whats the easiest way to get coin if you are UK based?<br />TIA

				They take a small percentage if you really think about it. SR could make a hell of a lot more if they wanted.

				I can understand not being able to find it. Quite frankly, the search function on this forum blows. I&#039;ve used fairly unique search terms and been unable to find specific posts. And if you searched &quot;SR commission&quot; you might be digging for an hour.<br /><br />You know how shitty the search function is? The commission info is in the State of the Road address. If you search for &quot;State of the Road&quot;, that post won&#039;t come up. Another (seemingly random) post in that thread does. It&#039;s neither the first nor last post, but some random post on page 13 out of 15. WTF.
