				&nbsp;Wow.. story by Brian Krebs<br /><br />****<br /><br />Mail from the (Velvet) Cybercrime Underground<br /><br />Over the past six months, “fans” of this Web site and its author have shown their affection in some curious ways. One called in a phony hostage situation that resulted in a dozen heavily armed police surrounding my home. Another opened a $20,000 new line of credit in my name. Others sent more than $1,000 in bogus PayPal donations from hacked accounts. Still more admirers paid my cable bill for the next three years using stolen credit cards. Malware authors have even used my name and likeness to peddle their wares.<br /><br />But the most recent attempt to embarrass and fluster this author easily takes the cake as the most elaborate: Earlier this month, the administrator of an exclusive cybercrime forum hatched and executed a plan to purchase heroin, have it mailed to my home, and then spoof a phone call from one of my neighbors alerting the local police. Thankfully, I had already established a presence on his forum and was able to monitor the scam in real time and alert my local police well in advance of the delivery.<br /><br />Rest of the story:&nbsp; http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/07/mail-from-the-velvet-cybercrime-underground/<br /><br />

				People on the forum have asked how anyone can know a bitcoin address belongs to SR. Here&#039;s your answer:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I received assistance from Sara Meiklejohn, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego who&#039;s been analyzing the role of bitcoin and anonymity on the Silk Road. Meiklejohn confirmed that the bitcoin wallet linked to in Fly&#039;s forum thread was indeed used to deposit two bitcoins into a purse controlled by anonymous individuals who help manage commerce on the Silk Road.<br /><br />Meiklejohn and fellow researcher Damon McCoy, an assistant professor of computer science at George Mason University, have been mapping out a network of bitcoin wallets that are used exclusively by the curators of the Silk Road. If you wish to transact with merchants on the Silk Road, you need to fund your account with bitcoins. The act of adding credits appears to be handled by a small number of bitcoin purses.<br /><br />&quot;All Silk Road purchases are handled internally by Silk Road, which means money trades hands from the Silk Road account of the buyer to the Silk Road account of the seller,&quot;&nbsp; explained Meiklejohn, author of the paper, A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names, to be released in October 2013 at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference in Barcelona, Spain.<br /><br />&quot;These accounts aren&#039;t visible on the bitcoin network though, so the only thing we can even hope to see by looking at the public transactions is when money goes into and comes out of the set of addresses that represent the collective account balances of all silk road users,&quot; Meiklejohn wrote in an email to KrebsOnSecurity. &quot;By manually tagging a handful of silk road addresses (via direct interaction) and then bootstrapping using the heuristic I described to label many more (around 250,000 in total), we are able to achieve this second goal by identifying addresses in the network that are &#039;owned&#039; by silk road.&quot;<br />

				The best solution would be for a new Bitcoin fork to integrate Zerocoin. Zerocoin makes attacks like this much more difficult, impossible in some cases. The Bitcoin developers are not planning to integrate Zerocoin because their lawyers suggested against it, but if an alternative currency that forks from Bitcoin integrates it then the solution would be to spend Bitcoins buying that and then spend the new currency on Silk Road. I really do think Bitcoin is shooting itself in the foot by not integrating Zerocoin, as soon as a fork comes along that integrates it a lot of people are going to ditch Bitcoin in favor of it. Nobody wants to use a currency that is 100% trackable, in the past we accepted Bitcoin because at the time there was no known solution to distribute mixing in a trustless way, but now Zerocoin has shown that there is no requirement for transactions to be inherently traceable and it has essentially outdated Bitcoin already.

				Why are people even replying man this is nonsense like I said btc cannot be traced but they can if you allow them to be traced ok the amount of codes is like a trillion codes so how the flip could this be manipulated it can&#039;t be and if it was so then all of us and our addresses are at risk ie we&#039;re all fucked which is totally BS well it better be cos my understanding of SR and the btc system was it&#039;s all safe cos it&#039;s anonymous so what now I do not believe this BS not for 1 second think about it the only people who can put buyers and vendors in jeopardy are the vendors themselves thats if they don&#039;t deal with then delete oh well all I&#039;m saying is this OP post is nonsensical to me and I hope it don&#039;t change from that so I call BS alert

				I see alot of these theoretical attacks put out but none of them ever materialize. Anyone get caught yet by having the EM patterns of their keystrokes recorded through the walls? If so youre going to need a tinfoil house.

				Since I first heard of SR a fews years ago I always wondered how LE would take it down. I always assumed that they&#039;d track down the people running SR and that would be the end of the party. <br /><br />But now there&#039;s research about how to track Bitcoins moving through the blockchain, and LE has closed down one cybercurrency site (Liberty Reserve) because it was supposedly being used to launder money. <br /><br />Cutting off funds to SR will cause the site to close up, and this, I think, is the feds new strategy.&nbsp; They can&#039;t find <br />SR so they&#039;re going after what they can find ~~ buyers and sellers of Bitcoin.&nbsp; This is why you have to give government issued ID to MtGox. And it&#039;s why you need to be more careful than ever when buying and moving your Bitcoins. <br />

				I don&#039;t think this setup was pulled off very well. <br /><br />The crux of the assault was that the hackers were publicly posting their plans. Furthermore whomever, plotted this -didn&#039;t even have the $200 for the Heroin and had to beg others to &quot;donate&quot; for it. <br /><br />If you just wanted to set the guy up -why not send him the dope without the middleman? I mean, the vendor was using stealth; Stealth is something that you don&#039;t want if you are trying to get the recipient caught. Send it from Russia using Media Mail. Don&#039;t hide the junk and let the package smell a little.<br /><br />Also, if some guy was caught by an anonymous tip with some H - A PISS TEST WOULD EXONERATE HIM. I mean junkies do junk. I don&#039;t believe that 2BTC worth of junk is really that much for a junkie -it would still be in his system.<br /><br />Finally, the amount seemed to little for this &quot;Security Expert&quot; (little more than a guy who knows the right people) to be targeted as a Dealer.<br /><br />This news is terrible negative publicity for SR. Drugs and one&#039;s personal decision to do them should be legal. Half-assed, harassing scare tactics like this are a step against the (the only sane) future of a legalized drug market.
