He has also attacked bitcoinstore.com.&quot;<br /><br />Silk Road users pay for goods using encrypted digital currency Bitcoins and access the site using the Tor network, making it very difficult for law enforcement to combat the trade.<br /><br />Debate on the Silk Road forums suggest a competitor had been scamming money to set up a similar website to Silk Road, and referred to a user named Vladimir who had reportedly taken orders and then run off with members’ cash.<br /><br />It was also suggested that the user may be an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration in the US.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t the first time this kind of scam has been used.<br /><br />In November last year, internet users in the US, Eastern Europe and Australia had their computers disabled by hackers and were told all their personal files and data would be destroyed if they didn&#039;t pay a ransom fee of up $500.<br /><br />A spokesman for the Australian Federal Police told news.com.au that more individuals and businesses were being &quot;held to ransom&quot; by cyber criminals as &quot;organised criminal gangs and motivated individuals understand the technology of the internet and take advantage of the anonymity that comes with it&quot;.<br /><br />The AFP said it and other law enforcement agencies &quot;would not stand for it&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;These groups can operate from countries with less developed legal frameworks and are increasingly sophisticated, operating from a high level of technical ability,&quot; the spokesman said.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.news.com.au/technology/biztech/online-drug-marketplace-silk-road-held-to-ransom-by-hackers/story-fn5lic6c-1226632387149

				What a joke of an article ! Another semi-literate journalist. I wonder how did these people get high school diplomas let alone jobs at major newspapers. It just goes on to show the sorry state of the mainstream journalism. <br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth - I appreciate this fact. The articles like this with no spine, no substance are totally confusing, and I bet the average reader had no fucking clue what he/she was writing about. Hell even I couldn&#039;t follow the plot ! :)<br /><br />Bring it on MM !

Of course that hasn&#039;t actually worked and in the end I gave in rather than ruin my lively hood but meh DPR will find a way, I have no doubt. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What about distributed denial of service attacks?<br />Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks typically rely on having a group of thousands of computers all sending floods of traffic to a victim. Since the goal is to overpower the bandwidth of the victim, they typically send UDP packets since those don&#039;t require handshakes or coordination.<br /><br />But because Tor only transports correctly formed TCP streams, not all IP packets, you cannot send UDP packets over Tor. (You can&#039;t do specialized forms of this attack like SYN flooding either.) So ordinary DDoS attacks are not possible over Tor. Tor also doesn&#039;t allow bandwidth amplification attacks against external sites: you need to send in a byte for every byte that the Tor network will send to your destination. So in general, attackers who control enough bandwidth to launch an effective DDoS attack can do it just fine without Tor.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />this is from torproject.org this is not any type of dos or ddos attack, i was playing with my tor proxy settings and put them on SOCKS 4 and got the silkroad site briefly but reloaded and gone, im still playing with it, i will update if i have a break though!

				Hmmmm if this was the case about crippling the site with traffic that would be easily overcome quite simply with traffic lights literally so it can&#039;t be that common sense prevails alas IF IF IF this is a hacker causing this strife it should be quite easily combated anyway I just hope that this is what DPR says it is and not anything else ??????????? <br /><br />Me personally I just think this will be resolved when a part and flight and someones knowhow is paid for I hope so but then again I&#039;m just thinking out aloud ha ha ha silly me again. ?.

Another semi-literate journalist. I wonder how did these people get high school diplomas let alone jobs at major newspapers. It just goes on to show the sorry state of the mainstream journalism. <br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth - I appreciate this fact. The articles like this with no spine, no substance are totally confusing, and I bet the average reader had no fucking clue what he/she was writing about. Hell even I couldn&#039;t follow the plot ! :)<br /><br />Bring it on MM !<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Off topic on whoever is actually doing the hacking attack but I&#039;m glad to see everyone blasting the shady journalism here. I thought I was the only one whose noticed this. I wanted to go into journalism when I was in college, but my school had a crappy program and now I regret not doing it. I feel I can write way better articles then most of these people who supposed get paid to do this. The pattern seems to be with younger journalists who write like their writing a Facebook post. Print journalism doesn&#039;t seem to be as bad as this it&#039;s primarily online journalism. I just imagine a bunch of spoiled rich girls thinking their Carrie Bradshaw and throwing up crap articles so they can go out for Appletinis with the girls. (Guys too, obviously.)&nbsp; There is just so much more speculation and out right OPINION than actual facts and information in these articles. I&#039;m not the greatest writer ever but I feel I can write one these articles.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;So my bros told me this site was like down and stuff because like a hacker or something totally like asked them for money or ransom or something. Someone on the forums or whatever totally said that so obviously it&#039;s true. Personally I don&#039;t really do drugs so I don&#039;t really care but other people might care but not me. I got a this new app on my phone though that lets me see even more Facebook posts so like and share this article and like me on Facebook and share this on Twitter and follow me on Twitter and on reddit and share this and up vote it on reddit. Dogs are cool, cats suck.&quot; <br /><br />It&#039;s like Idiocracy in here.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t the first rule of good writing we all learned in school was being able to keep the &quot;I&quot; out of it? (Yeah I realized how many I&#039;s are in this post, but this isn&#039;t a professional forum).&nbsp; :-\
