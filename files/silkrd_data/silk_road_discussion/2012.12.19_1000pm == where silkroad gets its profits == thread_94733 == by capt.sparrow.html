				I&#039;m currently talking to a vendor who i asked to make a custom listing. <br /><br />he originally told me that it would cost $530, but when he made the listing it was $560<br /><br />he messaged me and explained that he made the listing at 530, but SR added taxes to it and thats why it was $560<br /><br />now, this vendors been awesome is the past, but from what ive heard, SR fees are not directly applied to the customers, but the vendors who pay SR and DPR<br /><br />if this vendor is just jerking me around, or if im wrong, please let me know, 30 dollars isnt a big deal, but i need vendors who won&#039;t be shady.<br /><br />thanks for everyones time who contributes to this

				SR does add a fee for every item listed, I believe SR adds around a 5% fee for items &gt;$500, so the $560 he said would be the right amount for an item costing $530.

				He&#039;s not screwing you over. He&#039;s right. As a vendor, we have to pay commission to sell. We have the option of pre-commission posting or post-commission posting. This affects the pricing of our listings. If he has pre-commission option selected and make a listing for $530 it will actually display $560 making the buyer pay the commission. If he has post-commission selected and makes a listing for $530 it will display $530 but it will subtract the $30 and he will only get paid $500 when the escrow is released. :) Some vendors haven&#039;t figured this out yet and forget to calculate it.<br /><br /><br />Beats

				SR gets a percentage no matter how the order ends, purchased, refunded, canceled.<br />Also SR has hidden Fees like every btcent under the 0.01 gets added to the tumbler like 0.0001 or&nbsp; 0.00236547, everything past 0.01 gets dumped in tumbler.<br /><br />The More You Know

If the order is cancelled/refunded then SR does not take their commission. You may see a difference between your payment and refund if the vendor has his escrow hedged, but it isn&#039;t commission that is disappearing.

				I think that once it is marked in transit the commission is gone for good?<br />Also..vendors should really do the pricing post-commission if they&#039;re advertising a $ amount as the price anywhere, like with a custom listing. IMO

Yes, the buyer pays for the item, which I would get $33 for, but then SR takes their commission. <br /><br />Their marketplace, their rules. <br /><br />I suppose you could so the buyer pays for it, either way it doesn&#039;t matter.<br /><br />Plus, the commission is always a tiny amount compared to the order. So it&#039;s not going to make a significant difference.
