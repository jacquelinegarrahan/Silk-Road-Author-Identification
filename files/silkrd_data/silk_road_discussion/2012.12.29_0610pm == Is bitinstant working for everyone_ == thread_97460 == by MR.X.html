				I&#039;m beginning to wonder if BitInstant isn&#039;t actually going under or something.&nbsp; Their business is a complete mess lately.&nbsp; I mean an absolute unforgivable unprofessional mess.&nbsp; It&#039;s not just their site or customer service.&nbsp; Their API is down mysteriously for at least a week.&nbsp; No explanation, no answers, no nothing as far as I saw.&nbsp; Just keeps giving errors.<br /><br />I had really started to think well of them, too.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; If it isn&#039;t them, it&#039;ll be somebody else offering the service.

				I apologize for it may be an off topic question but this &quot;blue slip&quot; everyone mentions that you fill out your info to make the deposit at a moneygram in CVS.... is it in every CVS?&nbsp; <br /><br />Because I swear every time I passed by the red phone at a CVS all I saw was the red and white slip.&nbsp; &nbsp;Did I miss it? <br /><br />Thanks

				All I needed for CVS was the zipzap printout, which may be the &quot;blue slip&quot; people are referring to. You just pick up the phone, read them a number from the printout, tell them your info, then walk to the counter and tell the cashier your name/transaction #.

				I was having problems other morning getting my payment slip to even generate the other morning. They told me their site is bugging out if people try to use capital letters while filling everything in before generating payment slip.

				So its not a issue getting them through bitinstant even with the &#039;Cert&#039; Warning that comes up before letting you on? I hope these guys stay up and running cause its the easyiest and cheapest way IMO.. All i do is print the Slip, go to this little cashier check place that has money gram, i give them the info they put it in the computer i pay i leave// No issues, the people dont even know what it is..

				ended up going to a nearby CVS where the manager was helpful but they indeed did screw up my order on the MoneyGram end after 2 times on the red phone.

				Started a thread in the Security section in regards to having issues recently...everything seems to be fine for me at the moment and will be heading up to my red phone location shortly so I&#039;ll be sure to give some more input as the evening goes on. But the problems I was having which I was referring to in my thread was that I was getting the Untrusted / Connection error which had me quite concerned to say the least. It started yesterday for me and was still trying it before calling it quits around 5am my time. Anyways, this afternoon everything appears to be up and running fine now. Let&#039;s just hope everything goes well with the transactions! Fingers crossed! <br /><br />With all the issues going on with bitinstant lately, I&#039;m starting to think I really need to come up with another source but realized, I know of NO other options lol. So could any of you point me in the right direction of where I can find help in this area of things?<br /><br />Will update later tonight for you guys!

I&#039;ve done the bitinstant deposits at both stores. At CVS, you use the red phone and then pay at the counter. At Walmart, you fill out a blue slip and then pay at the counter. <br /><br />I also wanted to add that I did a bitinstant deposit today at Walmart and it went through fine. I actually deposited it right into my SR address for the first time (the last bitinstant deposit I did was supposed to go to my instawallet, but instawallet was having problems and I didn&#039;t get my coins for 24 hours, and I didn&#039;t want to deal with that again). I did the deposit around 12pm and it was in my SR account by 2pm. So bitinstant seems fine right now.

				Yeah I have become concerned for BitInstant during the last few months.&nbsp; They seem to be losing partners left and right, and their site is always full of bugs / glitches.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to start transitioning toward LocalBitcoins.com since you don&#039;t have to worry as much about $500 limits and stuff.
