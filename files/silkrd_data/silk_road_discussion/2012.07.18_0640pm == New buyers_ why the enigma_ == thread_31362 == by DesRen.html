				Ok... low rating, you have there money, why would folks thinking about holding on to it. Just make the transaction. The arrogance of the folks that aren&#039;t newbies anymore is fucking stupid, &gt;:( FI early, fine, but still ignoring notes and maybe even a little tutitulidge wouldn&#039;t fucking hurt&gt;&gt;&gt; probably got a client for life. You old fucking timers, deserve any anguish you get, just because you couldn&#039;t send a note saying, hey you put in right, good to go, see ya next time.&nbsp; Is it that fucking hard, and time consuming to spend 5 sec to be a human being. You folks preach love and understanding, but come down right to it your a bunch street fucking hustlers, bunch of liars and thieves, and that is not what originators of this site has intended.

				WOW!!&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure this is worth responding to but as i respond to almost 90% of the nubs that are too stupid to read my offerings or <br />sellers page i guess i can answer this bullshit too.<br /><br />All of my offerings say so many months member and &lt;5% return rate - basically a join date of January or before!!<br />I get soooooo many PM&#039;s just for business but it seems I get more from new people that either don&#039;t take the time to read or ignore <br />my listings and try to order or ask to order anyways. Arrogant? Me? I don&#039;t think so - I have gotten so many sketchy cop like PM&#039;s<br />that I have lost count. This is why I have this policy - to keep me safe from cops and scammers!! All of them showed up after the second<br />Gawker article. The arrogant one is u sir to think that us &quot; old timers &quot; can be pushed around somehow to change our policies. Maybe we are all <br />just tired of reading the whiny bitchy PM&#039;s we all get every day from immature snot nosed brats. None of us owe u shit! I know u think we do <br />but real life doesn&#039;t work that way my little brain washed friend. Is it written somewhere that u have the right to buy anything from anyone on here that u wish?<br />Screw u - I chose to stay safe from the cops and people with bad karma like U sir!!<br /><br />Peace out;<br />Christy Fucking Nugs

				Thanks... I finally learned some information from the arrogant pricks. You folks expect me to know all off this shit from buyers guide. I came across as an asshole, to elicit some response. Ohhhh by the way your right, stigma, oops. <br />Christ nugs---- thank you for your input, I can&#039;t get my feeling hurt... but your info was awesome... I can read 500 forums, and still not filter out what I need to be a better buyer. You have to admit there is danger on both sides. Lot of vendors probably don&#039;t have profile like yours (haven&#039;t seen, probably won&#039;t sell to now anyway:) that ok, I learned a lot, thanks! be safe

				I don&#039;t expect anyone to immediately know everything - I do however expect them to be able to read the two pertinent sentences and follow the directions contained within.<br />I have never purchased on here from other vendors yet so I am ignorant as to their behavior. <br />My apologies for being so hot headed - it was actually directed towards other users as I don&#039;t recall u ever PMing me.<br />Well some of it was towards u lol<br />It just gets sooo old!!!&nbsp;

				Totally agree ... I am a newbie to SR and attempted to jump through the hoops to get a purchase <br /><br />I have had 3 successful and top quality purchases&nbsp; ;) :o :o&nbsp; &nbsp;but had knock backs on at least 10 :(<br /><br />Should be a forum for newbies to introduce and talk with vendors to gain that &#039;trust&#039; <br /><br />then rather than cancel and get your back up , it can be settled in forum prior to purchase, I have had some great chats with vendors to take a risk on me with some great tips an tricks , which have worked .<br /><br />so I will keep buying and mailing as I deserve the product I attempt to obtain

				Vendors have buyers who have been around longer than you and me, buyers with more money, buyers with excellent ordering history, buyers with established relationships, and buyers who are professional and respect the requests of vendors.<br /><br />Yes, some vendors are stricter than others. But there are plenty who are willing to help out a first time buyer. I was interested in purchasing an eighth of cubies for my first buy; a small purchase of a product I enjoy to get myself started, but the vendor said I&#039;d need at least five orders, no returns, and I&#039;d have to FE. I looked around for about 30 seconds and found a domestic vendor with better prices, sent him a message asking if I&#039;d be able to buy from him, and he said yes, no FE, no previous purchases necessary, no limited or required purchase amount, etc.<br /><br />There are plenty of vendors on SR for most products, if you disagree with a certain vendor&#039;s requirements to make a purchase, keep looking. They are busy people who are risking their safety every day to provide us with products that normally are impossible to obtain, so I think them showing a little discretion and caution as to who they sell to is more than acceptable, if not expected.
