				Frankly I haven&#039;t noticed any problems with the website being down, but I only use the site for placing actual orders these days and I haven&#039;t made any for awhile -- still, may just be your circuits, not SR.&nbsp; Seems decently responsive for me.

				Well I&#039;ve been having a few problems the past coupla days, but I got on today OK, and managed to do some stuff. We can&#039;t ask for perfection, hell, this is working under TOR, don&#039;t forget. It&#039;s enough that we get the chance to do what we like as anonymously and safely as possible.

				That&#039;s not very nice, I just experienced having to refresh the login page a few times before it worked but out of all the places to complain why the fuck would you be complaining about SR?

				Let&#039;s see then...<br /><br />We have vendors accessing SR to service clients and conduct other vendor related business.<br />Then we have clients and potential clients searching, buying, sending vendors PMs for tracking info a few hours after they&#039;ve placed their orders or asking questions that are already answered on the vendor&#039;s profile.<br /><br />Oh right, and then we have every law enforcement agency in the world angling and scheming against us. Most notably, those from the US. How did we arrive at that conclusion? Well, between the hours of 9AM GMT-5 and 5PM GMT-5, otherwise known as Washington time, SR usually has connectivity issues. Outside those hours, things seem to run like a well oiled machine.

				You got to admit, there is a huge difference in performance between BMR (black market reloaded) Black Sheep and Silk Road.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course the road has more users, but to have to wonder what more infrastructure could do for performance .<br /><br />I notice that a lot of issues are related to Tor itself.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve ever used SR with a proxy like .to.

				I have been having a terrible time the past three days. What is strange is that sometimes, such as right now, I can get a (very slow!) connection through my phone (Android/Torbot) but not on my laptop... even through the same wireless network.

				The site&#039;s not down but it&#039;s pretty slow. You can get shit done but put on a game of FIFA or something to pass the time : )

				SS, yes, I am certain. I can turn off the network antenna on my phone and check that way.<br />Very interested in seeing your client app in action... but I am running Liberte via USB and I don&#039;t think I can install... I could be wrong.<br /><br />Still just hitting refresh over and over like an idiot... that&#039;s all I did during my lunch break, and all I&#039;ve done since I got home from work two hours ago.

				Can i say this as a perspective, IF DPR was running this site on a shitty slow server ect, with the admin ect involved in running this site, I think it would be in DPR&#039;s to make as much money as fast as Possible as a company can, To pay wages too staff, i doubt very much that the server here being the problem, i would put my money on the traffic.<br /><br />Which i would say is a big positive for vendors, and there are ways you can speed up Tor. I list one.

				If you don&#039;t like it then go buy in the street. There can always be improvements but crying about the issues solves nothing. Do you really think the solution is that easy as just buying a more powerful server? yeah like they didn&#039;t think of that,&nbsp; you must be very naive or retarded.
