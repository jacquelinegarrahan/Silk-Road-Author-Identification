				When i try to go to the SR homepage it keeps telling me the connection is timing out. I am having some sort of issues connecting the homepage. Obviously my tor is up and running and I can access other sites. Why would this be happening all day long? What can I do about it? Also, in case the site is down for everybody would we still have our forums?<br /><br />Thanks

				It&#039;s been pretty bad for me today.&nbsp; The worst it&#039;s been in probably a month.&nbsp; But I just log out of Tor and log back in and it stays up for a bit and then times out and then I just start the process over again.&nbsp; Sounds like there&#039;s extra traffic today possibly?

				The problem is SR is so popular that clients are DDOSing its introduction points with create cells to extend Tor circuits through them. Switching to a new circuit or identity will sometimes help because your Tor client discards the old introduction points it is trying to use and if SR has selected new ones it goes to them. SR could fix this issue by switching to the newest alpha version of Tor.

				^This. I just hope the po po isn&#039;t flooding legit circuits in order to make SR users connect through their own carefully placed nodes. You seem to understand Tor&#039;s routing better than I do; is this even possible? Either way, people will just have to keep restarting their Tor client to connect. Hopefully Tor issues a new stable build soon...
