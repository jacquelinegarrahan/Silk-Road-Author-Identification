				Hi,<br /><br />Your post is a little hard to read, but let me see if I have this correctly. <br /><br />You placed an order for 10 50mg Zydol tablets, correct?&nbsp; In its place you were sent 10 50mg generic Tramadol tablets, correct?<br /><br />It is my understanding that Zydol is simply a name brand form of Tramadol, is that also not correct?<br /><br />So, your objection is that although you received 10 50mg tramadol pills you are want a refund because they are generic, not name brand, is that basically the gist of your post?

				OK, I had a quick look at the vendors profile and product page and I&#039;ll explain what I believe to be the problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />I checked the vendors profile to see if it had anything to say regarding refund policies and I read the product description page for the item listing you purchased.<br /><br />First, the item description page has a graphic image of the product, in that image is a statement that says, and I quote:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Either Zydol or Tramadil (you choose ;)<br />Subject to availability.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In the product description it states:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">~reminder please leave a note in the address field if you want Zydol ~<br /><br />Taking some time off Items will be dispatched on Sunday&#039;s only, for the time being<br /><br />ZYDOL IS BACK PLEASE STATE WHEN YOU ORDER IF YOU WANT THIS AS IT IS IN SHORT SUPPLY<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Unfortunately what I believe is that you simply clicked &#039;add to cart&#039; for the listing without reading either the vendors profile page or the product description.&nbsp; The &#039;note&#039; that the vendor was referring to was the note you were supposed to leave in the address box regarding whether or not you wished to have Zydol or Tramadil as your chosen Tramadol brand.&nbsp; Absence a note from you the vendor simply filled the order with Tramadil.<br /><br />So, the vendor is correct in stating that they have indeed shipped you what you ordered, but that in the name of good client relations they are willing to give you a little extra on your next order even though they followed their product description page and you didn&#039;t.<br /><br />As for a refund, again, you need to read the vendors profile page for their refund policies.&nbsp; This vendor has a fairly clear policy of providing 25-50% based on a number of different scenarios.<br /><br />I realize this isn&#039;t what you were hoping to hear, but it is the truth.&nbsp; There is nothing SR will do in this situation and to be honest, it would probably be detrimental to your reputation if you were to push this any further as all they are going to say if they do respond is that you failed to read the product description page so the fault is your own.<br /><br />If I was in this situation, I would send a brief PM to the vendor apologizing for the misunderstanding, explaining that I had misunderstood the product information.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m sorry, but as Captainjojo has pointed out you are at fault here. You did a mistake by not reading the description of what you did buy and the vendor is 100% right.<br /><br />You should take responsibility of your mistake and not blame the vendor for it.
