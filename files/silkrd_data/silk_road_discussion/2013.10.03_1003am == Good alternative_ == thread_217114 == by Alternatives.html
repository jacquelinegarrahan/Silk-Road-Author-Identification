				Hey!<br /><br />What is the best alternative?<br /><br />BMR: the second after SR, maybe the next target? Yesterday someone sad: one of BMR&#039;s developer are knowed on IT forums?! That&#039;s true?<br /><br />Sheep: Silkroad&#039;s copy? Thats good?<br /><br />Deepbay: The youngest site. DEA knows about this?

				None are much good at all.<br /><br />Deepbay has no volume and is too new to trust (ha, well what can you trust really?)<br /><br />BMR has a heavy(ish) focus the fact it sells weapons - more of a victim-centered crime, something I&#039;m not keen on<br /><br />Sheep is trying to capitalise on SR&#039;s demise big time, but it&#039;s a hard site to navigate and has doubled its vendor entry cost in the last few hours<br /><br />By all means, sign up to these sites. But lets also watch the news and work on something new.

				BMR&#039;s admin wrote a message to his forum yesterday: they need to secure the site and today he closed the registration, because the server can&#039;t handle the big traffic...<br /><br />I mean Deepbay based on commercial software and this is maybe safer than Sheep?!

				I think it&#039;s possible you represent them. My reply was meant to test that, and I was expecting you to reply with only Deepbay as the recommended site (albeit in an &#039;objective&#039; manner) - which is what you did.<br /><br />Not saying it&#039;s true, just saying you responded how I expected you would if you were representing Deepbay.

				Personally I don&#039;t give a damn what&#039;s their next target. I&#039;m just concerned about the safety of the vendors and the people who run those websites.<br />If I want to buy something on the darknet again then I will do it, even if it means I&#039;ll lose some money because of some imbecile FBI/DEA/NSA assholes.

				Because of the way it has been spammed on here right after SR went down I would not touch deepbay with a bargepole, if the person who runs it is not LE then he is for sure an asshole.

				to those who think the alternatives are &#039;shit&#039; -- they are going to be flooded with Silkroad vendors and users, just give them time<br /><br />but ideally i would like to see a silkroad 2.0. does anyone have source?
