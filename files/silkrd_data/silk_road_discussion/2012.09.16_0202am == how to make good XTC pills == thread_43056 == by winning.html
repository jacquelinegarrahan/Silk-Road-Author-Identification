				Amphetamines are absorbed better by the gastrointestinal system in the presence of acid. That&#039;s what the vitamin C is for (ascorbic acid), and why many guides say to ingest MDMA with juice.

				im all for boosting potency, but would you let your customers know they are not simply getting only mdma?<br /><br />theres all sorts of potentially dangerous interactions possible with combining stims, especially if people are unaware of whats in their pill and take other drugs as well

				I&#039;m definitely for adding mephedrone!&nbsp; for a few reasons.&nbsp; It&#039;s amazing for 1.&nbsp; Also, on the topic of telling people:&nbsp; if you just add vitamin C, you&#039;re obviously not obligated to say anything, but most people buying pills of E are just buying a party drug.&nbsp; At least in the US Ecstasy doesn&#039;t really mean MDMA anymore.&nbsp; it&#039;s just some random party drug(or nothing) in a pill.&nbsp; Most of the time it&#039;s just piperazines.&nbsp; <br /><br />Still though, for several reasons if you&#039;re adding a psychoactive you should definitely say something(unless it&#039;s just caffeine).&nbsp; 1 if your selling it to friends, it&#039;s messed up not to tell them just based on that.&nbsp; 2 if you&#039;ve built a repore&#039; with your clientele, you want to keep it.&nbsp; 3 they could have an allergic reaction or a health condition you weren&#039;t aware of.<br /><br />With all that being said, my vote is for ketamine.&nbsp; It is a PHENOMENAL addition to a pill and it hits you like a train.&nbsp; DAMN! anyone else have the tan doves?&nbsp; those were the SHIT!&nbsp; But seriously, the ketamine hits you within seconds of snorting the pill and it seems like the MDMA follows within a minute or two instead of the standard wait.&nbsp; the combination is GREAT!&nbsp; i can&#039;t even begin to describe it.&nbsp; You should probably stick with primarily MDMA and a small dose of ket in case people take several.

				get a pill press.&nbsp; There&#039;s two varieties.&nbsp; manual and automatic.&nbsp; the automatic variety will really set you back in the wallet though..

				If you want to make pills you need a pill press.<br /><br />There are two types:<br /><br />Manual - ~$200. Upsides: cheap. Downsides: SLOW. ~150 pills/hr. Not all pills will be uniform in height.<br /><br />Automatic - ~$5000 Upsides: customizable stamp, uniform pills, higher pressure exerted to make harder pills, FAST. ~6000/hr. Downsides: price<br /><br />If you can afford the automatic then there&#039;s really no reason not to go with that. Now, actually getting one without attracting attention is the hard part...

				This weekendd myself and a few mates dropped capsules that i put together myself of 120mg of MDMA + 25mg of 2c-i,<br /><br />It was absolutely the best drug ive ever taken, four of my mates who are very experienced drug users, 2 long term, said the same, the two chemicals combined together should be considered one drug called Bliss, Jesus Christ Superlove, Budda&#039;s Orgasm or something like that! But seriously try it was brilliant and not too intense, imo its the perfect drug if your into your mdma and extacy.<br /><br />Dont forget to take your magnesium first though ;) it makes a hell of a difference the next day ;)

				You want to just get capsules if you dont have access to a press. You can crush up the mdma and whatever else and just stick them in that. You can then cream the profits this way by just putting in whatever amount and charging 10 euro or whatever.<br /><br />But be careful not to put too much in each one. You can fit quite alot in there.<br /><br />fish<br /><br />
