				Lately some off my orders have been refunded,&nbsp; after a long wait in resolution center they never appeared.<br />The seller has offered a refund.<br />But I got this gut feeling sooner or later they will arrive.<br /><br />If this same scenario applied in eBay or some commercial shit, I would be more than glad.<br />But when it comes to something very personal like &quot;drugs&quot; , it doesn&#039;t just feel right. Like a needle in my ass.lol<br /><br />Is there any ethics in SR or you follow when it comes to this?<br /><br />I have decided if I do receive I will transfer the product price minus the shipping cost.<br /><br />Edit: Finally, nothing came :(&nbsp; &nbsp;50 days+. If it had arrived I would have acknowledged first ; but would not pass back the whole off the re-funded coins. Best choice: Demand to minus shipping cost. Even better: Offers me 10% qty increase or discount on next order. Bare min: would demand a free shipping on next order.&nbsp; <br />Time might not be the most valuable thing for me, but it&#039;s quite important and let me tell you waiting for drugs is worse than any withdrawl I&#039;ve had, some may have experienced it too atleast to a certain degree. <br />It was not my bad choice choosing him it was his shipping or packing which failed. Or maybe it was my greed for wanting the best and a lot of it, while I could have scored locally. :-\

				If you morally feel obliged to give the seller back the coins because you did in fact receive the product, then I&#039;m sure the seller will be more than happy if you keep the shipping costs. However, shipping is out of the seller&#039;s hand, so should you really be penalising them for this despite you getting your product? <br /><br />Either you give all back or give none back in my honest opinion.

				Yeah, if it were me, and the seller was gracious enough to give me a full refund for a product not arriving, and then it came, I&#039;d have to say I&#039;d pay them back in full. I don&#039;t see how penalizing them over shipping speed, which is out of their control, is showing the same gratuity from your end. This person, a drug dealer, sent you, a drug user, a full refund including shipping. That&#039;s pretty damn awesome in my book. The only way to keep sellers awesome is to be awesome buyers, so I say if you get the product, pay back in full. They trusted you in giving the refund, so prove that you were worth that trust. <br /><br />IMHO, of course. :-)

				Had a similar situation where vendor cancelled order but it still showed, I contacted vendor to make things right and they were more than cool and said don&#039;t worry about it. It wasn&#039;t a large order but the basic principle still stands-do the right thing and keep the karma police at bay. I would send full price plus shipping, and besides that, you will be building a solid vendor/seller relationship and who knows what kind of perks that may come with.

				agree with frogtrap<br />personally I would pay for the product if it arrived<br />I&#039;ve only dealt with a few vendors so far but all of them have been a pleasure to deal with.<br />IMO this place is a market for a trustworthy vendor/buyer relationship... of course there will be exceptions to that as with any kind of dealings IRL whether legal or illegal.<br />build a positive relationship with vendors that deserve it and all will be good<br />beats the hell out of dealing with shady street dealers with shit product

				This is a very noble thing to do. I think if you do end up getting the product, it may be a little more difficult to transfer the funds when you&#039;ve already got product in hand for nothing. But of course, it&#039;s the right thing to do, and if you&#039;re ever considering becoming a vendor, doing things like this will get you rep with other sellers/people on the forums if they vouch you actually did it.<br />It&#039;s probably the right thing to do, but then again, if you both agreed on a resolution in the resolution center, you should both be satisfied regardless of what comes after that.<br /><br />maybe that&#039;s morally skewed. But I&#039;m sure vendors know that things like this will happen and don&#039;t really expect anyone to do that. but what the hell, people exceeding expectations make this place great.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind, I&#039;d like to ask advice on a similar but different dilemma I&#039;ve encountered recently on here.<br />If I order from a vendor and it consists of 1/2 one product and 1/2 another, what should I do when sent a whole order of 1 product? It&#039;s technically still worth the money I paid but it ain&#039;t worth much to me because it&#039;s not what I ordered.

				Tracking usually requires a vendor to go into the post office and purchase it... i don&#039;t think all buyers understand the possible negative implications of physically going into a post office to ship illegal narcotics through the mail.<br />I no longer have to go into the post office and I do have tracking on EVERY package I ship so the days of someone saying &quot;it didn&#039;t show up&quot; are mostly over. Yes, I did get ripped off a few times (search Polskiii).<br />My shipping method is on the vendor thread for any vendors wanting to stay out of the post office AND do tracking on every package.<br /><br />I think it would be appreciative of you if you sent the money back to the vendor. Our costs are way higher selling this way as opposed to street selling. I easily spend $500 a week in postage and shipping material before I ever get any money back to recoup my expenses. <br /><br />Take care,<br />TJ

				Just give the vendor the amount you owe him. Im quite sure they will appreciate it and might even do you a favor in return. Besides non deliveries are calculated in to the price, so the more non deliveries the higher prices will be. In the end the entire SR community will pay for that, so youre leeching of the community.

				if i paid for shipping, then i would pay for everything when i received this hypothetical package. i guess it depends on what the vendor is saying. if he talked to me and asked for it, i probably would.

				Definitely would contact the vendor, and ask for the best way to get them their coins.&nbsp; If they were real cool, maybe they&#039;d offer a discount on a future order or say to not send the full amount owed - but really the vendor was already being cool by offering a 100% refund when the delay wasn&#039;t their fault.<br /><br />Just the right thing to do - and assuming the product was good, I&#039;d want to keep a relationship going with a trustworthy vendor.<br /><br />

				I placed an order and had it not show.The order was for $143.02 Bitcoins rather large I contacted the seller and told him it didn&#039;t arrive he said he would refund half I asked him to keep the Bitcoins and just resend the order the new order came 8 days later but still have not received the original order (Canada post will have fun at their Christmas party this year) anyways I released the payment just on the grounds that mail gets lost and I really enjoy buying from this guy and don&#039;t want him to stop selling to me because of 1 bad delivery

				I don&#039;t see how there would be any question. If your order has been refunded and you received it anyway, you should contact the seller and arrange paying them the full asking price, including the shipping.<br /><br />Why would you leave the shipping out?<br /><br />Yeah, I think the whole point, at least to me, isn&#039;t to just make one purchase from somebody and then hop around and try everyone else, but develop a relationship with a few sellers so that you can get to trust one another and rely on each other&#039;s word. This helps the Silk Road&#039;s reputation too.

Just because your impatient ass had to wait for your drugs doesn&#039;t mean that you can screw somebody out of a piece of their money. If tracking was so important, you should have requested it before the order was shipped. Better communication with the seller would have prevented some of your problems.<br /><br />

				Be good to the Road and the Road will be good to you. <br />I once had a vendor make a mistake where I was shorted 4 pills.. He responded quicly and agreed to send the remainder, but he accidentaly shipped out the same order again, instead of just what he owed me. I ended up with several extra pills...very expensive pills!... .&nbsp; I told him about it right away and he thanked me for my honesty and did not ask me to send one single extra bitcoin for the mix up. I assume he realized where his mistake was and that&#039;s why he was so great about it all. Every transaction since has been 100% because of the trust that has developed, and I now get &#039;presents&#039; with almost every order. Whether a mistake is my fault, the vendors&#039;, a shipping problem, or whatever else, and whether i come out with extra product, or even if I end up taking a hit and losing money-- no matter what the situation just be 100% honest and you will be ok. Practice the golden rule.

				Wow, man, I don&#039;t even see this as a question.&nbsp; Why would you ever even consider not getting the vendor his money back?&nbsp; What kind of head does that sort of thing?<br /><br />You would damage the vendor who is now out his cost and profit; you would weaken the community at large.&nbsp; It is that kind of behavior (not sending the money back or some other attempt to scam the vendor--or indeed the customer) that will kill SR quicker than any LEO activity.<br /><br />SR functions as well as it does because of its enforced honesty and trust (read escrow) and, because in a market in which both the seller and the customer are satisfied everyone profits. :)<br /><br />Peace . . .
