				Am I the only one that notices a speed increase when using SR and the forums?&nbsp; Its a win-win, most CP is now gone from the darknet and in turn the whole darknet is considerably faster!

				I didn&#039;t notice it, but now you say iy, I started to think...<br />You are right.<br />At least SR main and forum seem to be faster.<br /><br />Benchmarks and cyphers will come soon, I guess.<br />It is to soon to say something indefinably.<br />If the next of the week sr main and forum ar slow again,<br />&nbsp;the average is still the same.<br /><br />To early to make a fial conclusion. <br /><br />It&#039;s all to fresh.<br /><br />But those figures are coming one of these days.<br />Maybe weeks, but months they shouldn&#039;t need.<br /><br />Just a little patience guys and we will know.<br />But I feel it too. Much quicker!<br /><br />wait and see<br />

And by that I mean that it is consistent. Some times it is slower then normal, but normal has always been pretty quick.
