				I have a love/hate affair going with shrooms which is epically tragic as I have what appears to be a 9&quot; white thumb when it comes to growing fungi. The body load during come-uppence has become nearly unbearable: last time after dosing approximately 60g fresh cubes, spent the first two hours in a nauseous hell, a fair amt of it on the porcelain throne shitting my guts out. Most serotonergic chemicals affect me this way, including L, but with shrooms it is now so bad, that I may have to quit using them altogether--hence my plea fo some sound advice.<br /><br />The bronchoconstriction and anxiety I can deal with--a puff off an inhaler and I&#039;m good to go. Wondering if anyone has tried Zofran--a 5HT3 antagonist that would appear to have the potential to nip it in the bud, but concerned it might also interfere with the rest....&nbsp; :-[ <br /><br />Or any other tips that may save my career as a psilocybe psyconaut. <br /><br />

				Number one, don&#039;t eat fresh shrooms, dry them first. There&#039;s less mass to contend with. It&#039;s best to powder them if you can, and dissolve them in orange juice.<br /><br />Second, eat it slowly, over the course of an hour or so for a large dose. The coming up will be smoother, and you&#039;ll get just as high.<br /><br />And third, always do shrooms on an empty stomach. Problem solved.<br /><br />goblin

				Thanks. maybe I&#039;ll pursue that again--but I find dry almost unpalatable (tea, whatever) and have considered powderizing--but don&#039;t have a suitable chopper/food processor at the moment. But I am not sure that is the answer unless its reduces the interaction with serotonin receptors in the gut--let me rephrase: even acid sends my guts a churning, empty stomach or not--but w/o nausea. Shrooms seem to be worse, a lot worse--maybe I need to try some synthetic tryptamines to test this out--I know there&#039;s a lot more in shrooms than just psilosybin that are potentially gut wrenching. FWIW my friend who i usually imbibe with has no problems GI wise whatsoever--just as blissful as a cheshire cat.&nbsp; &nbsp;But feeedback appreciated and yes 60-100 grams of fungal material at a time is asking for trouble....&nbsp; :o

				I have an iron stomach, so I usually don&#039;t get nausea from drugs. However, you might want to try making &#039;shroom chocolates. Then you don&#039;t have to worry about the taste, and I think it may help with the nausea too.

				Zofran will keep you from puking more than likely.&nbsp; However it runs about 13 bucks a pill from a pharmacy, pretty expensive stuff on top of the price of shrooms.&nbsp; I dont know if there would be any interactions with shroms, but zofran&#039;s main side effects alone can give you a pretty bad headache and constipation after it wears off.

				Mix up some dirty sprite or purple drank whatever you want to call it. Then consume the Shrooms with that. As I thought about it I think that would be an interesting combo. I can only imagine the high of Codeine and Promethazine followed by Shrooms. But to answer your question Promethazine is what you are looking for. Promethazine is fairly cheap and you can either use it suppository or tablet form. Zofran dissolves in your mouth and works faster than Promethazine, but either of the 2 should work for you.

				I have another suggestion: <br /><br />Lorazepam has antiemetic effects. It&#039;s a subtle intermediate lasting benzo. <br /><br />It is sometimes used in chemotherapy as an adjunct to antiemetics for treating anticipatory nausea and vomiting, i.e. nausea and vomiting caused or worsened by psychological sensitization to the thought of being sick. It is also used as adjunct therapy for cyclic vomiting syndrome.<br /><br />

				Chase that shit down with cherry flava pepto bismol. In fact, 1/2 dose pepto to start, narl up yo shrooms, other half of pepto to chase. Never had a puke problem doing that and you get rid of the nasty shroom taste.<br /><br />Other thing, shroom sandwhich. Country white bread, honey on both sides, shrooms in the middle. Eat that over the course of 30 mins with a glass of OJ to chase it down and...<br /><br />you might forget your name.&nbsp;

				Thanks for all the suggestions. Couple quick comments--zofran is available here on the road for something like 30 to 40 cents a tab (generic). Promethazine might be worth a try. This of course is a weak assed antipsychotic which always gives me pause when trying to get psychotic&nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp;But sounds as if not enuf of one to block the effects.<br /><br />One thing I would like to share as honey has never worked to disguise the taste of mushrooms--what we have found is pina colada mix with all that coconut does a magnificent job. With or without rum your call.<br /><br />Favorite Strain--all of the cubes are more or less the same stength with the exception possibly of penis envy. The whole strain thing is considered to be a lot of hype from many of the experienced users at the shroomery. Genetically not different enough to be considered true strains--more like different races. That said, the woodoving species are on average substantially more potent than cubes, but not as easy to grow.<br />

				I have yet to try psilocybin mushrooms, but I&#039;ve found nausea induced from regular mushrooms to be easily cleared up with a digestive enzyme tablet. I have no idea how this would effect the digestion of the compound and the trip itself. <br /><br />In terms of anxiety, I&#039;ve read that larger doses help rid anxiety by more fully immersing the mind, not everyone agrees with that though.
