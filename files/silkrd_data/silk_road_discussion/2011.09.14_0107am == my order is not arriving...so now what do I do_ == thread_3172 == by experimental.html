				&nbsp;&gt;:(<br /><br />And I don&#039;t think its coming anytime soon. And say if the seller is counting for the transaction to auto finalize where does that leave me.&nbsp; And if goes to arbitration, am I suppose to walk away with a 50/50 loss? And the seller walks away with the positive half?

				Although I have no experience with the resolution process. My understanding is that if the seller can&#039;t provide proof that the package was sent. i.e DCN, you could receive a full refund.<br /><br />The first thing I&#039;d do as a buyer is request the DCN. If this is a reputable vendor, something probably went wrong if the package doesn&#039;t show and you should try to work it out with them. Most good vendors are great about coming up with a resolution.<br /><br />Hopefully your package arrives, but in any event, good luck.

				I&#039;m having the opposite problem. 4 orders out, DCNs say received, buyers won&#039;t respond.... We both get bitten by the douche bags I&#039;m afraid.

				I had 2 different orders never show up. One the vendor had many of his packages intercepted (this was the claim anyhow) and the other guy disappeared for a month after I placed the order. I got 100% refunds on both. Some vendors will only offer 50% but from what I have seen the good vendors that are here for the long haul and understand the value of their reputation will offer 100% or a reshipment. Honestly if you use a real name at a legit address and the vendor packages everything properly the package loss rate is very low. I have not been around as long as some sellers but I have not lost&nbsp; package yet.
