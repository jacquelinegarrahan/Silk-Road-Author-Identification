				I would like to ask sellers to limit the number of listings they have in each category.<br /><br />Some vendors take up an entire page with mostly repeats.<br />Awesome weed 1gram, Awesome weed 2grams, Awesome weed 3grams<br /><br />and&nbsp; knock their competitors off the page. <br /><br />GreenCo is currently rated #1 in the weed section and they could, if they wanted, make a ton of listings and dominate the entire page. I am glad they do not.<br /><br />Vendors can still discount larger sales within one listing but it seems that some vendors are mostly just after page real estate.&nbsp;

				Hear, hear!&nbsp; you&#039;ve hit on one thing that there really isn&#039;t any kind of control to keep it from being abused.&nbsp; Hopefully lots of sellers will read this thread and do the right thing!

				Rather than throwing this on the listers, what if you were able to list a product such as Weed Strain XXX and then inside that page, there could be the different quantities. Personally I like to be able to see what kind of discount you get by purchasing a greater quantity. I think it would be really nice for the seller to be able to put multiple quantities on one listing.

				as a seller it can be quite annoying to have to post a listing for all the different measurements, all the different shipping methods. <br /><br />if you have 20 strains, and then you sell that in 1/8ths, quarters , half&#039;s , ounces, qp&#039;s , lbs..&nbsp; then you make a listing of each for usa domestic and worldwide.. you very quickly will be on the road to occupying multiple pages. <br /><br />As a seller that has previous inventory diversity from already being in business on multiple drug forums on the internet, I very much feel as a seller I shouldn&#039;t be limited to a certain number of strains, certain variety of products.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked fucking hard to keep so much in stock. Hell I&nbsp; moved across the country so I could do so, I invest huge amounts of money into keeping stocks in.&nbsp; I communicate with growers almost constantly, and I want every bit of my time and money invested in my ventures to count, so you better believe I will spend every spare minute of my time posting up what I have to offer, but even at that I&#039;ve not managed to post them all up. <br /><br />That said, it seems it could be streamlined some. But as someone with previous programming experience I can see from the site designers perspective and understand that adding features that would allow and account for different shipping methods, different quantities would take time , effort, and money to create... and even after that there could be bugs. Sometimes solving problems have a terrible way of presenting more problems than you had before.&nbsp; I certainly can understand why a programmer might just be tempted to leave it alone. <br /><br />users though, I can certainly understand why they want fairness.&nbsp; posting the same item multiple times to gain eyeballs on your single product is bogus.&nbsp; Some of us work hard tracking down many products for that same space. <br /><br />&nbsp;At the same time, Are there really so many pages of products that you can&#039;t make it though?&nbsp; Last I checked it wasn&#039;t that long, and if some sort of policing was to go into effect and the ruleset isn&#039;t defined clear enough, some sellers that have legitimately articulated unique products could end up getting screwed. Sometimes leaving things open to interpretation are just better and more free in the end.<br /><br />Am I allowed to list multiple phenotypes of the same strain?<br /><br />LOL&nbsp; ...&nbsp; just an example. <br /><br />On some forums out there, you&#039;ll notice people crop up with objections to how things run or , how something that someone else is doing, isn&#039;t fair. They set up threads on forums that they have essentially forgotten isn&#039;t theirs.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen this countless times, the politics of it all.&nbsp; Sellers conflict with objectors and objectors cry foul to mods.&nbsp; What i do think is that, wise mods don&#039;t immediately cave to demands of new features just because of social trends.&nbsp; They instead, react to the given situation and try to understand it, and rule on it as best as they can , when they have to. <br /><br />Honestly, after a site admin has established a good working framework, probably the more hands off the better.&nbsp; consider this... Do you really think you can come up with some master rule set that will make everyone happy?&nbsp; Although it might rub some people wrong, often leaving the ruleset open, and letting whatever inherent disadvantages be, is often better than the disadvantages that come about when trying to micromanage conflicts.&nbsp; You&#039;ll notice that bad moderators.. they are so swamped by these conflicts, that even with an ever expanding rule-set, cannot put enough hours in the day to truly review and judge on every situation that needs to be judged, when you create all those rules.&nbsp; Things usually don&#039;t get any better at that point.<br /><br />ok .. enough rambling. <br /><br />nite guys. <br /><br />

				If a seller has to do a custom listing for a buyer, could they place it under Other and then send the direct link to the buyer.&nbsp; That way the product pages aren&#039;t cluttered with random orders.

Simply query everything except hidden listings. Then the vendor would need to send the direct link to their customer. This would also prevent people from trying to buy custom orders that aren&#039;t meant for them.

				I do 1 custom listing and in description say for whom and what. Price also differs. When buyer purchase, listing is no more because quantity is 1.

				Tor is so fucking slow, that if the Silk Road just showed ALL THE LISTINGS on a single page I would not be complaining.<br /><br />It would also make it easier to search for keywords client-side using the browser.

				Well I think most sellers should take note that buyers now have the option to select quantity. So really you only need one listing and they can up the quantity in that listing. Multiple listings should really only be used for different types and or quantities with price breaks.
