				I too would like to know this as I&#039;ve been noticing it consistently higher than any of the markets.<br /><br />My own personal theory is that is gives buyers more purchasing power for their bitcoin at the expense of vendors who are getting only a smaller BTC amount in return. <br />It would also mean SR stands to make more on commissions.<br /><br />Actually what I really believe is that this is all made so complicated on purpose so everybody is clueless about how it works. <br />Some clarification on this in lay mans terms would be nice please, All I know is I have to raise prices or just peg in BTC as the $$ value of bitcoin here is way overinflated and not representative of any current market average&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />EDIT# Mt Gox should not be considered representative of the market price since they are not releasing $$ Funds right now so the price is way higher because of people buying coins there to sell on other markets just to use up the $$$ that are trapped in their accounts.

SR used to use MtGox weighted average but now it seems to lag after the most recent price on MtGox or something. This is bad for vendors because cashing out on MtGox is very difficult at the moment and all of the more liquid exchanges have a lower bitcoin value. So using the figures that Jack posted a vendor will get paid at 98.31 USD per Bitcoin then cash out at around 90 USD per Bitcoin.

				Indeed, It looks like SR formula is MtGox Value (highest of all) + X%(X being beetween 1-2), resulting in a 8-10% overprice of any exchange that is not mtgox.com (which right now is not processing withdrawals of usd).

It is not processing fiat withdrawals fast enough so people are buying up bitcoins instead. This increased demand has pushed up the price of bitcoins on gox while depressing it everywhere else. Don&#039;t use gox if you want to buy bitcoins.

Presumably it&#039;s volume weighted by exchange. You&#039;ve mentioned seeing it higher than Mt. Gox Last price, but I&#039;ve been looking and I haven&#039;t seen it rise above the 3 hour high for Mt. Gox. Perhaps he&#039;s using something akin to 3 or 6-hour average, in which case it could often be above the last price.<br /><br />Hard to say until DPR tells us the formula. I generally don&#039;t assume malice on his part though. He could always just raise the commissions. It&#039;s not like it makes any sense to make a few % by diddling the exchange rates.

				This too is also a problem me and a fellow vendor were talking about. The BTC value appeared around $104 on SR while cavirtex (Canadian exchange) had it selling $88. At that rate I lose just under $50 an oz after shipping which is a large part of my profits. <br /><br />It never used to be like that for me, but now it is becoming less and less worth it for me to be on SR. However sales are picking up, helping make up for the lower profits. <br /><br />Would be nice if you could peg it to an exchange or a variety of options.

				Seems pointless to me. Surely in the long run it&#039;ll just crank up the prices of product on here to compensate. SR wins, everyone else loses

				This is a huge problem for vendors, if I sell $4900 worth of a product and I&#039;m given 45BTC from this sale at their current exchange rate of $107.00, realistically I&#039;m only receiving $88 x 45BTC = $3960.00.

Gox is not currently a viable option for cashing out, and has not been so for about 2 months now. They simply are not processing fiat withdrawals in any meaningful way. So any vendor wanting actual fiat money has to use one of the other exchanges.<br /><br />Specifically it is also clear that the SR rate is NOT currently an aggregate of the other major exchanges (weighted by volume or otherwise). In fact the SR rate seems to be consistently just above the MtGox rate. As the other exchanges are trailing MtGox by about 8-10% it is to that degree that vendors&#039;s earnings are being discounted.<br /><br />Not cool or workable at all...<br /><br />BG
