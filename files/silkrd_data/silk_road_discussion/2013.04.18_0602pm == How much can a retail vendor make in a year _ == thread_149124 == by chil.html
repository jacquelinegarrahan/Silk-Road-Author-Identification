				Nothing seems unrealistic to me anymore!<br />Not after coming here..<br /><br />I reckon its possible if you bust your balls,<br />sell smalls and dont smoke to much,<br />I know I would fail at the last one.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t get is how do you keep the money<br />on the hush hush, you gunna need to sell those Btcs<br />how do most venders explain so many bank transfers, <br />or do they have fake accounts?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				That&#039;s totally possible, my advice is not to sell ANYWHERE except SR if you are growing.<br /><br />Cashing out is easy, just do it slowly and maybe use some of your friend&#039;s/family&#039;s bank accounts every now and then. Or just hold you BTC for a few years.

				Worry about cashing out later. Get started with your grow &amp; get selling, If you end up with too much BTC to cash out it&#039;s not exactly the worst problem to be faced with.

Buy 1000 phone cases at 50c each &amp; list them on your new business for $99 each. By all 1000 off yourself through various accounts over tor over a year. Keep half legit books for the business so you can pass any future audit... Pay your taxes ;)

It is the same line of thinking when how will you convert btc. Making large sums of money this way has a tight window, usually. Worry about making and protecting the money first before you think about cashing out. You are killing yourself before you even get started, mentally.

				How much can you make? Depends on how much demand there, how good your shit is, how reasonably it&#039;s priced, and how hard you can work.<br /><br />How to make the money legit? Hard to know how much to post on here as this kind of thing should be kept secret. I plan on doing something a bit like this:<br /><br />- set up an website with some merch that you sell for BTC, or that you accept BTC donations to. Doesn&#039;t need to be great, just plausable. The higher-value you can make the merch appear the better.<br /><br />- set up some fake sales. <br /><br />- set up a few throw-away BTC wallets<br /><br />- transfer funds to the BTC wallets, then transfer from them to your legit website wallet over time (in fact, probably as you go along making sales).<br /><br />- sell the BTC openly on the BTC markets<br /><br />- to be clean you&#039;ll probably have to declare the money made from BTC sales and pay taxes on it. I have no idea in what way you&#039;d need to do this, but probably the same as setting yourself up as &#039;self employed&#039; or some shit - talk to an accountant.<br /><br /><br />The hardest thing about this by far will be making a website that&#039;s plausable. I&#039;d make it some lunatic conspiricy site, or some christian thing, maybe even survivalist or some such - something that would attract donations... There&#039;s loads of site that sell bullshit for money, check out the SubGenius website; it&#039;s funny as fuck, but their shop is basically selling easy-to-print certificates for money. Look at Scientology or NewAge bullshit - sell a brain-tuning machine or EM healing device. Look around for bullshit that stupid people pay money for...

And even more importantly, the BTC fluctuation makes it unsafe to keep tons of BTCs in some wallet without cashing out. Remember the 35 to 2 dollars drop ? <br />For as long as I&#039;ve been thinking about my SR business, the laundering part is what has been taking me the most time. I mean, you REALY do not want to get caught.

It overwhelmed the market and the internet with crap, yet it allowed some talented people to emerge. Same goes with the SR phenomenon, the democratization of drug dealing brought lots of incompetent people, yet it allows talented drug dealers to emerge. <br /><br />If I had to choose between keeping drug dealing within an &quot;elite&quot; and making drug dealing possible for anyone, I still would go with the latter. Why ? Mainly because it makes room for competition, and thus, price lowering and the need for a better product. <br /><br />See, without disclosing too much of somebody&#039;s future plans, I believe the Sr community is seriously gonna benefit from the presence of a new vendor&nbsp; ;)

Thats SEALING&lt; PACKING&lt; LABELING&lt; DROPPING 17 fucking packages a day to make enough to afford a reasonable lifestyle. Thats day after day of dealing with stupid fucking customers and SR&#039;s shitty site, all the while freaking out because the price of coin jumped 200% 6 times in the last hour. Thats moving $200k in funds through the system without getting caught, and giving the middlemen a good 9% of it. <br /><br />You&#039;d be lucky to walk away from this whole fucking operation making as much as a phonejockey at a midsize company. Look at it this way, for all the risk and effort, your garbage man is making more than you.
