				Hi there!&nbsp; I&#039;m a new vendor here on SR, I&#039;ll be starting out by listing 30 count 20mg capsules of Adderall XR each month.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got more interesting things coming in the next few months too!<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if more established sellers have any advice for a newbie at becoming a successful seller with good reputation.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a buyer on SR (under a different account of course) for over a year now, but this is my first time selling anything.<br /><br />Any listing tips?&nbsp; Stuff I should watch out for?&nbsp; Tips to make a customer&#039;s experience better?<br /><br />TIA!<br /><br />-friendlynpcvendor

				Hello and welcome. I&#039;m certainly&nbsp; not an expert. This is my 1st time selling also and I have a lot to learn but Ive come from being last place, stuck there for about a week, to where I am now.&nbsp; I don&#039;t sell many things so its been hard and slow working my way up but I didn&#039;t know I was going to like it as much as I do. Hopefully you will too and that will help. My goal was never to be #1 or even to get good feedback., I just wanted people, in this easy to scam environment of&nbsp; anonymity, to know&nbsp; there&#039;s someone they can trust that&#039;s not going to cheat them no matter what. So for me honesty has been my main focus.&nbsp; To finally answer your question I think it is simple. Have the best product you can get, sell it at a good price, give good service,&nbsp; all the time being honest treating everyone with respect (even though they could be LE and not deserve it) and you cant go wrong. That&#039;s all I&#039;ve done and so far its working for me. Hope that helps. Good luck to you.

				Thanks for your reply!&nbsp; It&#039;s good to hear that all it really takes is honesty and commitment, I was already very prepared to bring both to the table.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see how it goes!<br /><br />If you want to check out my first listing, it&#039;s here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e93a9c0d51

				A good way to get some early feedback is offer a few samples to reliable buyers - It may cost you a small loss, but would help get you up and running quickly. Therefore your small loss will effectively turn into bigger profits faster.<br /><br />Just a thought.

				I am scared of getting samples from new vendors.&nbsp; I&#039;ll never take them.&nbsp; I&#039;ll take a sample from an established vendor, but I&#039;m afraid a new vendor would be leo.<br /><br />My close friend is trying to become a vendor here for pain killers.&nbsp; He set up a vendor account on Black market reloaded since the vendor accounts are free.&nbsp; He is having no luck..&nbsp; Nobody goes there because they are very over priced compared to here.&nbsp; plus, free vendor accounts = scammers galore

				Trippyskies - I would not worry about new vendor samples, after spending $150 on a seller account and a further investment on samples the vendor is unlikely to send out shitty samples. LE are predominantly after vendors not buyers (unless you are buying to resell)<br /><br />Black market reloaded looks ok but there are loads of put of date listings. It offers escrow so in theory is as safe as silk road. The site does have a significant lack of buyers compared to SR but that is probably as a result of SR having had the media coverage.

				Starting up an interest thread and from there vending some reasonably priced product to members who seem most trustworthy is probably a good starting point depending on how much stock you are trying to shift.

				Hey All.. i&#039;ll be purchasing a vendor&#039;s account in the next month or so and start selling. It&#039;s good to have a forum full of vendors who are happy to help out the newbies. Thanks in advance for everyone&#039;s help, just lurking the forums has given me a good idea on how to get myself up and running.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t have a vendors account yet but i have been scrolling up and down the forums. I have noticed one other thing to kind of be on the look out of. Competition. Other vendors that sell the same things as you can be pretty cut throat at times. They may log into the forums as a newbie and throw off on your goods and service. They may buy from you just so they can do that. There are groups that stick together here at SR. <br /><br />There are &quot;trolls&quot; that can give you some problems. As much as you may want to and strive to do so, you can&#039;t make everybody happy all the time. There are time when you have to say fuck it and fuck them. Don&#039;t be too soft because there are those that prey on the good hearted vendor
