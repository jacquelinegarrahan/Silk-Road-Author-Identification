				&nbsp;I don&#039;t have a vendor account but I have to assume certain things look different while logged in through a vendor account and just curious what the differences are.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Here is some specific questions that I am curious about:<br />&nbsp; 1. Do the vendors see their own feedback listed with the buyer&#039;s name that left each rating included, or is it just the same 4 columns that a buyer would see in any vendor profile and if not, can they figure out who left the FB if they are not logged in and see it appear right after a specific order just finalized?<br />&nbsp; 2.Do they get any better message inbox features or is it the same as buyer? <br />&nbsp; 3. What else can you tell me about the difference.<br /><br />&nbsp; Not looking for anything meant only for the elite that is supposed to be a secret to be revealed here, though I doubt any of this would be classified information.<br />&nbsp;

				We have a real time counter that makes a &quot;ching&quot; noise every time someone finalizes. It can get annoying, so I just disable it in the settings. There is also the option to choose what background you want to surf the site with. So instead of the plain boring white page you can turn it black or red.

				Vendors can change the avatars for all non-vendors. So if you have a cool looking avatar we can choose to make it look like either Peewee Herman, Mickey Mouse fucking Mini Mouse, or Hillary blowing John McCain.<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty cool.<br /><br />Modzi

				Are you kidding me? Vendors can&#039;t disclose all the details...<br /><br />Let&#039;s just say that it is TOTALLY different, it&#039;s all web 2.0 AJAX goodness...&nbsp; WAY more data mining than Amazon or Google do...<br /><br />Hover over a buyer&#039;s name and it shows when they first logged in, when they last logged in, what OS they were using each time they logged in (just displays the different ones and counts unless you go into the sub-menu), it shows what page they last saw when they were logged in, shows how many tabs they have open on average, shows the titles of all pages they&#039;re presently looking at, pulls up all their forum posts (but only shows the last 10 unless you go to the sub-menu), but get this, it&#039;s not only forum posts they made, but also posts they looked at frequently, and the posts about them in the vendor&#039;s only forums!!<br /><br />The vendor site (it&#039;s really not fair to just call it &#039;the SR site while logged in as a vendor&#039;, it&#039;s worlds apart! call it &#039;the vendor site&#039; to be more accurate) includes a really advanced BTC trading platform that just kind of stays on the side, but if the BTC exchange rates start changing it gets bigger, depending on how much change it might be - I guess it&#039;s so you will give it more attention when they think you should... It&#039;s there so you can make money trading BTC to USD (or EUR or GBP, etc, etc) and vice versa... It&#039;s AWESOME!<br /><br />The whole thing is just totally packed with all these crazy features, vendors aren&#039;t allowed to talk about it but we thought someone had to break the silence!<br /><br /><br />...<br /><br /><br />

Not really no, we just don&#039;t have to fill out a CAPTCHA. However, we do to create sub-accounts so other people can access only certain parts of our accounts so if we take other people on to help us they can access information without putting the account at risk overall.<br /><br />3. Not much really, we can do pretty much everything else you can with a few extra options, might upload some screenshots if we&#039;re allowed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thank you for the genuine reply, seemingly one of the few unfortunately, but I expected sarcasm and jokes from &quot;the elite&quot; to come in but seriously, thanks for the insight.
