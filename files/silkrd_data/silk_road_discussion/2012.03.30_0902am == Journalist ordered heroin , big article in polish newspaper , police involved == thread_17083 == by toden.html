				Hello,<br />There was big article about order from silk road in one of bigest polish newspapers on first page.<br />Links on their website to article that was in newspaper :<br /><br />http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,11440237,Heroina_przyszla_poczta.html<br /><br />http://wyborcza.pl/1,75248,11447835,Tropem_heroiny_przez_internet.html<br /><br />You can see she ordered heroin from Noriega, 72% purity after they tested it.<br />Polish police said they are in contact with police in holland.<br />The best is that customs said that they don&#039;t check letters sent from other EU countries :D<br />Anyway they don&#039;t know how to handle it from what i&#039;ve read , polish police only monitored internet for child abuse sites and pedofiles, it&#039;s new for them.<br />They only acted (i mean police) becasue of that article , i don&#039;t think there will do anything else.. <br />

				My biggest fear is that the media in the US will catch on to this. Imagine the shitstorm if &quot;Your children could be ordering heroin on the internet!&quot; was plastered all over fox news. It is strange to me that a story on SR has yet to be ran in the US, surely the major news organizations know about it. It&#039;s on wikipedia for fuck sake. I assume they haven&#039;t run the story because LE fears that it will make more people flock here? <br /><br />Also I love how predictable the media is with their scare tactics. Of course they didn&#039;t order MJ, of course they didn&#039;t order shrooms, and of course they didn&#039;t order any nootropics or any of the cheaper prescription medication for sale here that could potentially help countless people. No. They went straight for the heroin so they could paint us in the most negative light possible. Truly a pathetic move if you ask me.

				There was a news broadcast about SR a few months back. That&#039;s why so many new people (like me) joined, innit? I was baffled that it didn&#039;t go any further than that.

				couldn&#039;t have made a better advertisement. in the news spot even a uniformed border agent admits that there is nothing they can do, because within eu they are not checking so rigorously. <br /><br />If I were a consp. theorist, I would think that the whole news spot was planned and paid for in the same way you strangely learn about reagularily before christmas and easter in some neutral publications about the miraculouseffects of black chocolate. Right then you have extensive promotions of a premium brand.<br /><br />back to the original piece of news - it was a complete manual how to get here and what to do, step by step.<br /><br /><br />No, it doesn&#039;t necessarily take some group of dark manipulators, but businesses may have greatly benefited nonetheless. Just as before, bbc, discovery and broadsheets all over the place told in detail about shrooms and about iboga and aya trips to Latin America and Holland.

The FBI has known about SR for quite a while. Don&#039;t you think if it was as simple as shutting down a server they would have done that by now? The SR servers are hidden behind a series of TOR relays. Therefore, the only people that know the location are the people that run them. I&#039;m sorry if I sound like a dick but I would think someone with 256 posts would know a little bit more about SR than that...

Lets keep it that way. <br /><br />BTW there are only 3 countries in the world with direct connections to the pacific submarine fiber optic cable, and to the CFX-1 submarine fiber optic that goes under the Atlantic, 1 of those countries has 4 redundant connections to both and optic cables Arcos and Maya to U.S. and Mexico/Caribbean, plus the hosting companies in that country advertise discretion.<br /><br />Anyone with common sense and google knows where these servers are.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Anything the government does costs money, money they don&#039;t have. You really think they&#039;re going to spend money/manpower to try and shutdown SR? It wouldn&#039;t even be worth trying and they know it, I mean look at the cartels, they&#039;re decapitating people in public and calling out the government and no one does anything for a reason.

I can see it now &quot;Grandma ordering drugs, GETTING HIGH&quot; tonight on new channel 23. Your right they wouldn&#039;t order weed or xanax no they go for Heroin, what about the children there all going to be junkies.<br /><br />I hate the news around here with their local investigations into the guy who didn&#039;t pay taxes or who owns a strip club that gives lap dances. The journalist talks so condescending to these people just cause they know if they do anything they have the cops. There always little fucking bitches with their nose in everything.<br /><br /><br />We should fight back. We know their news station everyone should take a little bit of their drugs and mail it to em non vacuum bagged. What does losing 1 bud hurt or 1 xanax or just rubbing your nuts on.

				Journalists trying to score points with the mainstream anti drug hype. Same people are using drugs just as much as anyone else and they damage society by supporting outdated ideas at the request of old doddering media tycoon and slimy politicians.<br /><br />Some journalists would not touch such a story but many journalists are just paid to use their intelligence to manipulate public opinion. Its not working though. In the UK almost anyone under 50 agrees that heroin ought to be legalized. In my town the heroin is sold by guys who are so obviously making money. The journalists miss out that because its easy to sit in an office and order a half gram of heroin. They likely ordered an 8 ball of coke to write up the article also. Many of the anti drug propaganda is written or designed by people high on drugs. The advertising world is awash with coke and other drugs.<br /><br />Maybe journalists can do a story on themselves in future and not force us all to buy the usual gear which is dangerously cut and likely to kill the average addict injecting before they are 50.<br /><br />As for the half gram of heroin being enough to literally kill off half of Poland - lol.<br /><br />Maybe the child porn sites are FAR more dangerous than a site which offers heroin.<br /><br />Heroin hurts those who use it - we all know that - but consider the users who work hard and pay for the gear and if using a decent batch the health is not affected too badly. Heroin is one of the most benign drugs actually. If we are talking pure gear then its medical fact that its fairly harmless. You could use pure heroin all your life and look in good shape. Using the street gear is the killer. Inject that a few thousand times and damage will be done. In my area I know people with no legs. Street gear. The same gear that has been sold under the noses of cops for 30 years in the UK. The same gear that fills the prisons.<br /><br />Tobacco is far worse than heroin. But lets not let facts get in the way of a sensationalist story.

I speak to people about stuff like this all the time and most people are very apprehensive about the class As. <br /><br />

				I hate to be a downer, because I know we all are loving Silk Road, almost as if it&#039;s our wildest dreams come true, but I&#039;m afraid that it is inevitable that word will spread and the media, probably in the US, will create mass hysteria and draw too much attention to what&#039;s going on, ending SR as we know it.<br /><br />SR may not be permanently shut down after this event that I predict will happen, but it won&#039;t be the same. This journalist story is just the beginning. I think the US media is too busy covering the upcoming presidential election, but I could definitely see a report in the near future. Chris Hansen comes to mind as someone that would buy some Heroin.<br /><br />What we can do to ensure that this is around as long as humanely possible, is to be extremely careful regarding purchases and shipments that we make, the way we conduct business, and who we tell about Silk Road. The first two are easy, even an idiot knows certain things that should be done, like not leaving a paper trail or a messy place with paraphenalia and stash everywhere for the cops to find, leaving your computer on for someone to see Silk Road pulled up with Heroin and Cocaine being advertised. But the issue about who we should and should not tell about the Silk Road is a different story.<br /><br />My opinion on who we can tell about Silk Road? Nobody. Not your best friend, not your wife, not your girlfriend, not some guy who you are arguing with regarding the fallacy of drug laws...absolutely nobody. I found Silk Road on my own from a whim and a prayer, and I had no idea if it was even for real until I spent my first $500. I was prepared to lose it just to see if this whole thing was real or not. If I had to find it myself and go through the process of figuring out that it was legitimate and how the process works, so can everybody else. Don&#039;t let anyone know where you are getting your stash from, and really don&#039;t sell or give any away to anyone else, because loose lips, people that can&#039;t handle their shit, etc., tend to fuck things up.<br /><br />What I think is going to happen? Some idiot seller is going to sell some kind of fake or adulterated product and kill one or a few young people, and the surviving members are going to tell their stories all over the media on how their friend got sucked into the fast life of Silk Road, etc., etc. Some bullshit laws about checking the post or something like that for illegal drugs will be enacted, and likely fail, but they will still try anyway. The govt will then make a very futile effort to try to stop the technology invloved, and that will be ridiculous as well. Who knows how it will end.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s hard to say.&nbsp; That Wired article mentioned earlier shows the capabilities they have, and I doubt seriously that if they *really* wanted to throw a lot of juice our way, that they couldn&#039;t bring this place down.&nbsp; I try not to get cocky or underestimate the various governments, and as I&#039;d posted in another thread asking for people&#039;s ages, and another asking where we were, and just seems like a good idea not to presume they aren&#039;t looking to build some profiles on buyers, and even better, on sellers.&nbsp; I&#039;m not paranoid: I doubt any serious paranoid would come near this site. <br /><br />But it&#039;s important to just use reasonable precautions, and always operate under assumption that LE monitors us to some degree or another.&nbsp; Only time will tell...The Poles are just doing the same thing the yanks did when those senators saw the articles and got all riled up.&nbsp; Probably all countries will do it, once or twice, same as U.S., then move on to other things.<br /><br />I&#039;ve actually talked to a criminal attorney about this, and suggest others that have money/time/interest do the same.&nbsp; Gets into some interesting facets of federal vs. state law as california marijuana growers well know...Knowing something and &#039;proving something beyond a reasonable doubt&#039; are two very different things....Have Fun but Be Prepared&nbsp; ...&nbsp;

				Anyone that says that LE would not try to bring down SR or that its off their radar is a FUCKING IRRESPONSIBLE MORON.<br /><br />Really, that might be true right now. But what world do you live in? This is the world of sensationalism. Of media frenzy.<br /><br />ALL it would take. And I mean literally, all it would fucking take is one kid ODing or one kid buying a gun off the armory and shooting up his school and it is very likely that they will be gunning to bring the darknet down. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter if there are bigger organized criminal gangs out there. It doesn&#039;t matter if SR is mostly for people buying personal amounts. It doesn&#039;t matter that there are bigger players in the drug world to catch.<br /><br />We are talking about the irrational and nonsensical police agencies and governments of the world here.. These are the same people that shut down MEDICAL MARIJUANA CLINICS.. For fucks sake, people with actual recommendations from medical professionals..&nbsp; their clinics were shut down. It&#039;d seem like they&#039;d be off the radar too wouldn&#039;t it.. that the resources used to shut them down wouldn&#039;t be worth it..? <br /><br />So to suggest that we are somehow invincible or below the radar is frankly idiotic.<br /><br />The only way, the ONLY way that SR will stand the test of time is if everyone here is VERY paranoid about law enforcement. We have to ALWAYS assume that we are under surveillance. I mean, for fucks sake have some foresight. You think because nothing has gone wrong so far it will never happen? Anything can happen in this world. Law enforcement are NOT rational, not at all, not in any sense of the word. It does not mean SHIT that most of the sales on here are for personal amounts.<br /><br />If the public/media got behind shutting SR down, you&#039;d be a fucking clown to think they wouldn&#039;t try.<br /><br />So for example I think all sellers should wear hair nets/mouth guards/double latex gloves and never touch any of their envelopes with their hands or even breath on them. They should be stored in double sealed plastic bags and only exposed to air when the product is being placed in them, and then should be stored again in plastic bags until they are posted. I think anything less than this is running some serious risks.

				The hard thing is just to keep at it, u know, with whatever protection you find necessary, from putting address in PGP (which I never figured provided all that much protection anyway, to using TAILS&nbsp; https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html and a different notebook flash drive&nbsp; and go somewhere I don&#039;t live, to do sales and all (separately).&nbsp; Not to get all bogged down in it right now, but any newbies, please read thru the &#039;Security&#039; forums as in the first few months and onward, there was a whole lot posted on how to protect your pc and you from intruders and spies...a few hrs could save your freedom, and start a thread if you have questions.

				GPG, aka GnuPG has *never been cracked*.<br />Maybe PGP, because it was widely suspected Zimmerman capitulated during the crypto wars to the government to be able to sell his product. All corporate closed source PGP should not be trusted either.<br /><br />GnuPG, no. Never. Impossible. Only if you use terrible implementation, meaning an easily brute forced password, or the agencies can seize your system and recover the key. Otherwise it&#039;s never happening, not in our lifetime. The world&#039;s GPU clusters and supercomputers can&#039;t break AES, Twofish, Serpent or GPG. They don&#039;t need to, because most people don&#039;t use sufficient entropy in their passwords and use bad implementation.

I like to think that the best cryptographers are on our side, but this isn&#039;t necessarily true. Or maybe it is true, but maybe the government has cryptographers that are, say, 80% as good, but they have hundreds of billions of dollars to put into number theory research and custom microprocessors.

RSA? ELG? DSA? 3DES? CAST5? BLOWFISH? AES(128? 192? 256?)? TWOFISH? CAMELLIA(128? 192? 256?)? MD5? SHA1? RIPEMD160? SHA(256? 384? 512? 224?) For that matter what about the key sizes of the asymmetric algorithms? Anyway I just humor you I already know you are just trolling because you seem to think that PGP is in itself an encryption algorithm lol. <br /><br />Was there a mathematic breakthrough in factoring large composite numbers into primes? Are all of the non-government cryptographers from academia in on the conspiracy? Why have you not sold this information to foreign governments, that is some pretty valuable intelligence! <br /><br />Bruce Schneier said he doesn&#039;t think NSA can pwn strong crypto in response to that wired article. He thinks they can hack into computers and steal keys. He thinks they can do timing analysis and other fancy attacks to steal plaintexts and keys. Implementation is a lot more than using a good password. It is really something that must be done correctly by the person who makes the software. There are a lot of ways that implementation can be fucked up, for example in a streaming encryption program maybe it takes longer for the CPU to do one type of operation involved than another, and by measuring timing characteristics of input/output the attacker can slowly or quickly gain bits of the key (because the person who implemented it didn&#039;t make sure to use constant rate operation time set at the maximum time any of the operations could potentially take). Pseudo random number generators have a pretty established history of frequently being poorly implemented, and if your PRNG doesn&#039;t really randomly pick a number from a range it will potentially greatly reduce your keyspace (for example one PRNG always generated numbers from certain planes instead of even distribution through out the entire range, when represented in a certain dimensional space, I really don&#039;t know math well enough to talk about this though....). Also PRNGs need a random seed and entropy accumulation is not a perfected art. There are a lot of ways that encryption systems can be compromised, but the actual algorithms being compromised is pretty much the *least likely* way for modern strong encryption algorithms to be pwnt. <br /><br />I talk with a few cryptographers on occasion. One of them did speculate that it is possible that some previously published attack on AES-128 was implemented by the NSA (talking about the same wired article) and that they may be able to compromise *some* things encrypted with it. I really don&#039;t know enough about crypto to even relay the highly technical things he was saying on without fucking it up, but I am pretty sure a less than ideal PRNG was a prerequisite to the attack. Bruce also said that he wouldn&#039;t be totally blown away if he found out that NSA has enough classical computing power to brute force 1,024 bit RSA keys, but he said he leans towards side channel attacks. <br /><br />So in short, it still seems as unlikely as ever that NSA can directly break strong encryption algorithms, and in the worst case scenario they might be able to break a small amount of ciphertexts encrypted with AES-128 under certain circumstances, and they might be able to brute force RSA-1,024 when they want to bad enough to focus their resources on it. I guess it is possible that they made a quantum computing breakthrough, but none of the professionals seem to think this is very likely.<br /><br />GPG works like this. First a PRNG is seeded with randomness and used to generate a random string. I am not sure how its entropy accumulation works but it probably hooks into the OS entropy pool cryptgenrandom on windows and /dev/urandom on unix, which are always gathering entropy from events like you moving your mouse and typing on your keyboard etc. The output from the seeded PRNG is then hashed to create a session key. Your message to whoever is then encrypted with a symmetric algorithm using the previously generated hash as the key to decrypt it, and also a randomly generated initialization vector which is used to initiate cipher block chaining mode (CBC mode) (without an IV the word &quot;dog&quot; will always encrypt to the same ciphertext....not good...especially since if you have an image that is black and white the black and white pixels will all encrypt into the same respective ciphertexts !..look up ECB mode....)&nbsp; . The session key is then asymmetrically encrypted with whoevers public asymmetric key. The final message is then base64 encoded to make it into text that can be worked with (ie: sent through email). Then when whoever gets the block, they base64 decode it, use their passphrase as a key to decrypt their symmetrically encrypted private asymmetric key, use the private asymmetric key to decrypt the session key and then use the session key to decrypt the symmetrically encrypted message.<br /><br />All that said, I could really not give a fuck less if NSA can pwn strong encryption. NSA doesn&#039;t share information with federal police except in matters of terrorism and espionage, and even then they rarely do and it seems only with FBI. Since I am not a major international terrorist, am not safe guarding foreign military secrets and am not commiting espionage against the USA or its allies, I can be pretty confident that NSA will never target me and will never share the dragnet intelligence they have gathered on me with any of my adversaries.

				Anyone who thinks the US gov isn&#039;t interested is mistaken. SR mightn&#039;t be top priority right now but they have patience. There&#039;s a student here in the UK that hosted ads on his website for a tv rebroadcasting site, He made a few quid off it. The US has been trying to extradite him, spending many millions. They&#039;ll get him soon as he&#039;s running out of legal options. Looking at 10 years in US prison. It&#039;s a nothing case but once they want you, they get you. That megaupload guy Kim DotCom made massive money. He&#039;ll not get out for decades once they get him back in the States and these are just piss ant copyright breaches. The DEA is a worldwide organisation whose primary motive is to justify its budget and extend its global reach as part of the matrix of US imperialism. Sooner or later (and I would say right now) they will be looking very hard at SR because it is the perfect reason (in their eyes) to justify a crackdown on the net and civil liberties more broadly

				Also I bet most of the people here heard of SR from the press. I saw a report on Channel 4 news, one of the UK&#039;s biggest news shows. ! minute later, I was hitting the net&nbsp; :) The main effect of that Polish report is that every dope fiend in Poland will be battering down Noriega&#039;s door trying to get some of his 72% good shit, rather than that kompot crap they have over there....

				I wasnt trolling.&nbsp; I am not here to troll.&nbsp; I just found the discussion interesting.<br /><br />And yes, I didnt specify much information, and I am well aware of what PGP is, and what it isnt. I wasnt speaking out of ignorance. <br />I have a history in Unix system administration.<br /><br />Which at a point in my life I was employed as a Sys admin for certain agency (and in fact, good guess as to it being NSA, because thats who it was).<br /><br />I was trying to be brief, and elusive, because I dont want people on here to be paranoid of me, but since I am speaking on a matter of principal now.&nbsp; I will admit that at one time in my life I worked as a Unix system administrator for an agency under NSA.&nbsp; So while I may have not been the one breaking code, or spying on communications, I kept network operations for that data.&nbsp; And so, I had access to that data, and yes, had clearance for that data.<br /><br />Yes.. I know what PGP is, and yes, there are different algerythems, and some are safer than others.&nbsp; Also I did say that it takes alot of effort to crack things (IE brute force, in some cases).<br /><br />I dont wanna come off cocky or anything, I was just trying to share part of what I know without giving too much away.<br />(for my own sake)..<br /><br />but you know.. what the hell... lets go for it and get it out there.<br /><br />NSA can break alot of aspects of PGP, but as of 2005 (the last time I worked there).. it wasnt -easy-... but if they had a pgp encrypted communication that they had reason to believe contained information viable to them. They could -usually- decrypt it.<br /><br />You&nbsp; have no idea what these guys are up too, what their resources are, or what they have done in the past.<br /><br />I do.. and I am here to say and put it out there, if you -draw- attention to you, and give them reason.. there is pretty high likelyhood they will read your communications.<br /><br />Like I said, not to make anyone paranoid because, you first have to have their attention... and I can say at least with the NSA they have no interest in whats going on here...&nbsp; DEA FBI, sure... but they dont have the same capabilities as NSA or CIA.. and to say NSA doesnt share with other agencies, is purely outrageious ... THEY DO..&nbsp; &nbsp;Mostly CIA/NSA do share. because they are in the same business SPYING and Communications.&nbsp; and while Im at it, Ill just keep going.&nbsp; NSA isnt supposed to spy on domestic communications or people, and in fact are forbiden to do so by federal law, but as of 2005 they found loop holes and were activly spying on -some- domestic communication via various court orders.<br /><br />I had to sit through a lawyer telling me why it was ok, so Im not yankin anyones chain here.<br /><br />I wasnt trolling at all.. <br /><br />and forgive me, I am a newbie here.. and I really hope I havnt hurt my reputation already, but I do like to share what -little- i do know..&nbsp; sorry to cause any trouble.. but I assure yo uI wasnt trolling or ignorant.<br /><br />The people who worked where I worked, were all phd mathemations and computer science majors. They spent every day all day breaking cyrpto,&nbsp; <br /><br />and just to put everyone at ease about me, the NSA doesnt give a flying fuck about drugs, hell I wasnt even drug tested working there, and would regularly show up at work fucked up.&nbsp; <br />But I havnt worked there in a long time, and have since changed careers, but I do have a strong background in Networks, programing, and crypto.<br /><br />after all.. who do you hire to keep people out of your networks?<br />

				sorry to continue on..<br />but yeah are there mathmatical breakthroughs that others dont know about?<br /><br />Yes!<br /><br />Do they have computer equipment that nobody else has?<br /><br />oh hell yes..

The people who have actually seen it, are pretty paranoid to leak actual direction solid information..<br /><br />why?? Hell I am scared more about typing this, than I am about buying a couple of grams of MDMA thats for sure.<br /><br />Why didnt I sell information?&gt;?<br /><br />ARE YOU CRAZY?<br /><br />fuck no!&nbsp; treason is not a fun thing to be prosecuted for.. and yeah I am scared.. I feel that I am still trying to be vague, without giving to much info about myself.&nbsp; last Thing I want after working for those assholes to be busted for sharing sensative information (they dont find this to be a joke at all)<br /><br />anyways.. Im just gonna stop now.. but PGP is -mostly- safe.. but it isnt as safe as others would like to think it is.&nbsp; Is it safe for whats going on here? yeah pretty much unless you are already drawing attention to yourself, in which case, pgp isnt gonna save your ass.<br />

The second link is the Gawker article, and the fifth link down is a website dedicated to show people how to access SR. While these news articles may increase the market&#039;s publicity, it really won&#039;t make a noticeable difference if it&#039;s this simple in the first place. ::)<br /><br />www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What do you mean &quot;public?&quot; It&#039;s certainly not a corporation, as the term &quot;public&quot; implies. I think you simply mean it&#039;s not a secret. Well, it sort of is. The media hasn&#039;t reported on it to any significant degree, and the reason I know this is because my ass just heard about it recently, and you can be damn sure I was looking for hook ups for a long time prior to hearing about it.<br /><br />The fact that someone can look up &quot;Silk Road&quot; and get information about it is really beside the point, because you actually have to be looking for a way to buy drugs off of the Internet or have heard about the Silk Road to be looking in the first place. <br /><br />But regardless of whether you feel the Silk Road is underground or not, it&#039;s our duty to keep it a secret. From everybody. Even your best friend.

				It really frustrates me that these reporters will do anything for ratings and don&#039;t care if they ruin people&#039;s lives in the process. It really is sad the stigma that is associated with H. I&#039;ve actually heard a college professor admit in class that uncut heroin is one if the safest drug you can put into your body. <br />I also share that fear that a big US news reporter will do a story on SR and then shit will hit the fan. What if there is a wave of stories about SR. Should we blame the media for all the 14 year olds that would attract? How about the ODs that would result from attracting the people who don&#039;t respect this freedom or the substances and just want to do massive amounts of drugs. I hope SR will somehow do something to take care of itself in case this were to happen. Maybe close registrations for a while. IDK.... :(

				to me it&#039;s a real catch 22, if the media reports it but nothing happens to SR, all you have really done is advertise the site and drive folks here that never knew about it, something that I doubt they would really want to do.<br /><br />I bet there are dozens of articles/stories written that never get past the editors desk for just this reason.<br /><br />I sure would have been interested if I heard it on the news, i only found this place by accident.<br /><br />Hawk

				SR was unmasked publicly about this time last year. Anyone who joined post-gawker article (majority of you) have publicity to thank for it. The authorities know about this - SR was used a pro-argument for passing SOPA (or ACTA maybe). Problem is if idiot low brow papers like the sun and prob this useless polish one print articles about this is might become a problem - I doubt it though cos I remember there was the same stir after the gawker article.

But, I guess if you&#039;re comparing the article that this topic refers to, and if its the same stir, considering that this article in the sun was complete bullshit and has caused no stir at all, I guess I would agree that it is indeed the &quot;same stir.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t remember anyone mentioning it in regards to SOPA at all, so I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re referring to there either.
