				It&#039;s confusing, how do you rank up higher? <br /><br />I am confused because i see one vendor having this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">has been a member for 1 year<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 6% of sellers with 99% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and another vendor<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">has been a member for 7 months<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 1% of sellers with 97.4% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions<br />has 1182 fans - become a fan</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The first vendor has more than 300 transactions too, but has higher positive feedback, yet he&#039;s ranked lower than the second vendor.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

It seems to heavily weight the average transaction amount.<br />(The only reasonable explanation for how doing hundreds of small $ value 5/5 transactions actually DECREASES your rating. Unless the categories themselves are weighted, but that seems less plausible)

				It depends on your ratings and your transaction volume, I presume.<br />SR applies algorithms towards the ratings that give the most recent ratings more weight in the calculation.<br />But eddietheguns slide cannot be explained this way as he has 5/ratings only.<br />

				Just one bad transaction can seriously drop someone&#039;s %. It&#039;s like that on most sites like eBay or amazon. I wouldn&#039;t just go by the %. Look at the feedback and also do a search on the forums. <br /><br />

				Just thought I&#039;d point out that there&#039;s another explanation for Eddie&#039;s observations: his competition moved up in rank much faster during the period in question.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s very unlikely, but nobody seems to have mentioned it, and it is possible... so there it is.

				Wait, when they say top xx%, what does that mean? Is the highest grossing vendor the top 1% or the top 99%? The worst vendor is 1% or 99%? I&#039;m confused

				I think they should just scrap the percentage system and put in a system of grams to explain a vendors weight. <br /><br />
