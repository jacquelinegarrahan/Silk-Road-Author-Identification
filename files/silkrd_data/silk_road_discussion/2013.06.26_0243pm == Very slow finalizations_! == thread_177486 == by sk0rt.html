				I&#039;ve got about 20 things in the orders queue at the moment and most of them are 5+ days old and I&#039;m 100% certain that at least 10 have arrived!<br /><br />Is this a common problem here? People place an order and then *woosh* disappear and wait for the countdown?<br /><br />I&#039;m not worried as I have money but it&#039;s a bit of a pain - and I&#039;m looking forwards to getting my refund for purchasing vendor account which was like $500!

				I think some people tear the package open the moment it arrives, dive right in, and then lose touch with reality for a few days. Or if the person has no more money in their account at the moment maybe they purposely don&#039;t log back in for a while so as to not be tempted by things they don&#039;t have the money for at the moment anyway. It doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s right for the customer to let it autofinalize. I was taught that being a good customer means finalizing your order within 24 hours of receiving it.

				Given the nature of psychedelics (what I mostly order) I cannot do this myself, but I think part of the finalization process is making sure you got what you paid for and testing the product out, be it chemical or good old-fashioned taste testing. It&#039;s pretty unlikely I&#039;ll drop acid the minute I rip open the envelope, so I finalize on arrival, but I see the merit in waiting a day or two after touch down to get high and make sure your molly&#039;s not RCs/coke&#039;s not speed/heroin&#039;s not sand. According to threads that have popped up once in a while, this type of waiting has saved a handful from scams.

I know vendors appreciate this because it releases the funds into their disposal so they can continue to keep their supply chain running smoothly.
