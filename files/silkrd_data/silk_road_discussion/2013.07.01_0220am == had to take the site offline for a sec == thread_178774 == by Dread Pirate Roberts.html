				I hope it turns out there are some account issues, because I&#039;m having trouble logging in. Going back and forth with SR support right now.<br /><br />Who keeps the last deposit address they used handy? Jeeez.

				Didn&#039;t know until the site went down that there was an extended attack here recently. Some little twat with a botnet shows up every couple of months and starts attacking all the torrent sites I am on as well. Probably the same kiddo. He seems to get off on that nonsense. He tried to blackmail several sites for accounts and it didn&#039;t work out so well for him. He eventually gets tired of it and goes away, or runs out of money to keep paying for the botnet. Doesn&#039;t seem like it is his own or I doubt he would stop.
