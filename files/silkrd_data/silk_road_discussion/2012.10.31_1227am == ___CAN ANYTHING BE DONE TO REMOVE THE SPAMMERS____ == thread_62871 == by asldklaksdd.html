				I am not in this thread to whine about the spammers or to blame the busters for machines being quicker than people. BUT is there anything a common user&nbsp; like myself can do to help in anyway to help reduce the spam and the load it puts on the busters. and please dont hate it is an honest question!

				of course i dont mind people offering/ asking if they can help - i appreciate it... the problem was this member went and spammed every subforum posting the same exact thread multiple times, so he was not trying to be helpful but complaining and just made the spam problem worse himself by adding to what i had to remove. <br /><br />there are a few recommendations on the forum alerts thread, and you could also report the site to the hosting server provider to potentially get it removed, but they wont directly prevent the spam unless the site is shut down and then another would likely appear. if enough people message the admins, not the mods, then maybe they will be motivated to do something about the spam to prevent it, instead of just trying to remove it
