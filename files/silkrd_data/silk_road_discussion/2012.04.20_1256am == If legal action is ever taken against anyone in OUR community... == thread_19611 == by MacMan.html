				God forbid this ever happen. But i was thinking if LE were/is to take action on anyone in our community we should all have each others back! Whether it be someone needs lawyer help or just moral support we should be there to help. I feel this is a wonderful community that we have here a utopia if you will:]&nbsp; After seeing the story about that Farmers Market place i started thinking about this.<br />What do you guys n gals think?

				Part of me that feels that there should be a pool set up to help a respected vendor or buyer that got caught. The easiest way would perhaps be for DPR to bring his commission down from 10%to 9.5% or something like that, so the remaining percentage would automatically be put into this pool that could be used should there be any legal trouble at all. This is the best community I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure to be a part of, and it really does suck that the awesome people in it are all able to go to jail for life for their so-called &quot;crimes.&quot; Like you said, I believe that we should protect our fellow Roadies for the good of the community.<br />

Seriously, just a 0.5% out of every purchase would be enough to ensure a pretty good fund that we could use to help our fellow community members. We all know that the people on this site aren&#039;t criminals, and the fact that we&#039;re classified as such is bullshit. This might be a way to show LE that we won&#039;t just stand back and watch them walk over our fellow members.<br /><br />Honestly the hardest part would be getting the money to them without also revealing their identity as a Silk Road member. But if there&#039;s a way, let&#039;s find it and end all the bullshit. Day after day I feel like maybe if the world governments want to fight a drug war, it&#039;s time to actually fight back.

				But, whats to stop a seller from going rogue and claiming a bust with any random newspaper drug bust as their proof, collecting a huge bounty (for their lawyer of course) and just hitting the bricks. Now if that fund were used as a retainer for an attorney chosen by DPR, then I guess it would be better, but again, who is would end up bullshitting a bust to get away with a big scam, while some random drug peddler on the street gets the attorney that SR has paid for, with all the bells and whistles.<br /><br />better Idea, if you sell drugs, put money aside for your defense/retirement fund

				Unfortunately in drug cases 99.9% of the time there is no bail, so not like the vendor could come back on here and plead for money. Would be a huge mistake to do that before trial anyways, guaranteeing your guilt posting &quot;Hey I&#039;m this vendor and was busted&quot;. If there was bail you would obviously go dig up your fake passport, IDs and cash and skip the country before trial, avoiding decades in jail for petty dealing

				A fund sounds like an excellent idea(I have thought about it myself)... but in reality, why should someone getting busted fall on DPR or the community to fix?<br /><br />Someone once told me that there is not a person in the world that would not dog(SQUeeeeel)on their fellow man to police in the name of self preservation if one was to be caught out.<br />Im like &quot;Bullshit...some of us have a code&quot;.. but as much as I would hate to admit it, there would be a limit on how much persecution myself or anyone is willing to bear.<br />That is why I will never order or sell more than I want to because it will be easy for me to tell the police to go fuck themselves.<br /><br />The trick is dont bite off more than you can chew. If you cant do the time dont do the crime..blah blah.<br /><br />So if you cant afford a good lawyer, fines, prison time, community service or your girlfriend dumping your ass.... dont use SR or limit what you do.<br /><br />Personally I like the idea/L but it all starts with being smart and setting your limits. Why should a community try and save some drug fiend that cant control themselves or a reckless/unlucky vendor?

				now I DO see a benefit for having donation funds for the commissary accounts for those we&#039;ve lost. I try to make a habit of sending money to Ene, and Jootgatter is going to eat a few meals on wretched for sure. and If a bitcoin exchanger would send a postal money order to the inmate account for you, it would be pretty anonymous. But honestly, there is NOTHING illegal about sending money to the incarcerated (although, the info should be kept to those who won&#039;t try stupid shit like shipping acid in with a letter). If trusted members were to set up Bitcoin funds for that, I would donate quite regularly, and I think we all should (I mean they sacrificed their freedom so we could get high, I can sacrifice a pack or two of smokes every few weeks for them)

				You know what might be feasible.. is have a donation fund, totally voluntary, whoever wants to chip in, with DPR or site support as the bag-holder. The purpose of the donation fund (after one full year of growing) would be to retain a lawyer (and I mean a good&nbsp; one.. one who specializes in criminal drug cases, racketeering, money-laundering etc. and has experience before the Federal Bench) not to represent anyone.. but to give a considered legal opinion about the site. Sort of a &quot;amicus brief&quot; without the impending court date. Such an opinion could give the legal grounds for charges, stipulate in clear and authoritative terms the &quot;chain of custody&quot; issues everyone yaks about all the time, and provide a starting point for vendors to hand to THEIR lawyer... who is very likely not up to speed on such matters.<br />&nbsp; It is my understanding (and this would have to be clarified) that an attorney cannot represent you as &quot;innocent&quot; if you have admitted your guilt to him. At the same time.. explaining the ins and outs of a site such as this might very well require you to say things to your counsel that really get close to admitting guilt. And the sucky thing is.. we&#039;d never know.. so do we tell the lawyer everything or give them partial information? In a federal drug case? <br />&nbsp; But a consulting/amicus type brief, paid for by donation, would not suffer from needing to maintain innocence.. he&#039;s not anyone&#039;s lawyer.. he&#039;s just a guy hired to critique and give a solid legal opinion. <br />&nbsp; He might also (and I don&#039;t know if this is feasible or compatible with the ethics of the bar.. have to ask a jurist I guess) be able to refer individuals charged to suitable counsel applicable to their own troubles. <br />&nbsp; This way nobody&#039;s counsel (who obviously has to know who you are right?) would be involved ... and since the consultant doesn&#039;t know who anyone actually is.. he&#039;s not lawyer to anyone.. just a legal consultant.

				DPR: A lawyer would be a great start, but perhaps instead of having him/her come on the forums, you create a thread to get questions that should be asked to these lawyers (a few different opinions is always useful&nbsp; ;) ).<br /><br />Once we have a short-list of the most relevant questions, you could have them answered by the legal professionals, and post the results.

				very interesting thread. its always good to be proactive and be one step ahead and think out all possible scenarios and outcomes to&nbsp; any possible situation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if anyone were to get in trouble for anything whether it be jaywalking, murder, buying/selling drugs on the internet never talk to the LE with out an attorney presant or at the least your shitty public defender which is a right of yours if your broke. the LE will lie and try to coerce you to fuck up. theyll have no prob. telling you theyll take your kids or ass fuck your mom what ever the situation to get the information they seek.....ask for a lawyer and dont cut deals to save your ass because more than likely your &quot;deal&quot; still involves going to jail. the less you say the more a good attorney has to work with. also if i were a vendor i would definately have a just in case fund set aside with a trusted friend or relative who would be reachable should that day ever come. you can even prepay lawyers ( theres a word for it i cant think of now) and call them when SHTF and theyll come bail you out. <br />`

				The first problem I see is this is an international site.<br />Maybe I am not thinking outside the square but how is representation in say the US, going to help some bloke in New Zealand?<br /><br />Thats a whole lot of countries one would have to find representation for. Doable I suppose..<br /><br />And if there is hedged representation... I will be ordering keys of coke instead of grams. Because I can.

				Well, if you kept quite and maintained composure you should have a chance of beating it by saying that you didn&#039;t know what it was and just went to the post to collect mail, because they called and requested you to. Get a decent lawyer and take it to trial. This will draw it out, so you can be a little less stressed knowing that you have time to come up with a strategy with your lawyer and gives them time to lose paper work and samples as well as forget things.

				Well its a nice idea from a good place. IMO who thinks that a fund to pay legal fees would offer protection to the community misunderstands many things <br /><br />People and lawyers for a start. Everyone has an annoying habit of acting rationally in their own interests.<br /><br />The difference between professional criminals part of a larger enterprise and some hippie selling weed his mum grows is a large one. Thinking that we are not already buying from people with direct links to &quot;real&quot; criminals is naive, as is thinking that the fund would be worth more than the trouble it would cause.<br /><br />The community and SR itself offer the greatest degree of protection simply by providing an arena where hardworking professionals can purchase recreational substances with the best risk:reward ratio. When danger threatens, a quick note on the front page of SR would find an influx of people with qualified and experienced advice.<br /><br />Increasing protection is more a function of making it harder to scam people by improving the ratings system to further increase the reliability of SR rather than saving money to pay Saul.

				I have read the thread and similar ones, and seems that most people are specific to one country or legal system. Much sales are going on Europe. In fact if you are caught, you are screwed and legal help will do close to nothing.<br /><br />I suggest creating pool of donation for a hitman. If someone high ranking here (like owner, moderator or seller) is getting in trouble, kill the damn cop who is leading the particular case! The fear of certain death of loved ones by drive-by or RPG grenade most likely will make the cop hide the clues and wash the suspect clean of all charges. There are hitmans that can kill targets almost anywhere. This is war, they are not hesitating to use guns and violence against people who are involved in drugs, we should not think twice to do the same to them!

				In my opinion goals are more important than means used to reach them. The goal is to keep people free from aggression of government. The government first draw their guns, it&#039;s time to fight back if anyone from community is threatened. We are quite anonymous and decentralized, we might be more resistant target than any oldschool drug cartel. I think LEA already is raining maximum heat on SR, it does not matter how or if we retaliate in cases of emergency. We all are criminals, drug dealers and terrorists in eyes of general population.

				Tor based communications are pretty safe from the prying eyes of law enforcement.<br /><br />That coupled with gpg and the power of the bitcoin and your online communications should be all but fool proof.<br /><br />The most common issue is watching who you deal with irl and making sure that you keep all friends and associates clean. <br /><br />If a undercover (speaking from a US perspective) infiltrates your organization then its best to handle it quickly and discreetly. Personally if I had any doubts as to the integrity of a buyer I would immediately cancel all orders and cease communications with that person.<br /><br />All and all I believe the SR community is a very safe place indeed :)

				Silk Road is very safe if everything is done properly.<br /><br />The problem might be if SR server or personal operating it is compromised in some other way. Even if 95% of buyers and sellers remain anonymous, I think we should have a plan in a case SR owners get busted. The publicly visible pool of tens of thousands of bitcoins as a bounty for a hitman will serve the same deterrent purpose as nuclear arsenal of superpower.

				As soon as you become complacent you invite trouble. NO, you are not safe. Ever. No matter what you do. You can lessen your chances of unfortunate things happening to you but ultimately you are not safe. There are NO trusted vendors. Any of them. I have my favorites to. I don&#039;t trust them. I do not trust you either. I do not trust my &quot;irl dealer/friend/whatever.&quot;&nbsp; I find it odd that trust can be gained on a website. <br /><br />Escrow protects us all. It&#039;s not perfect and your stats will be horrible messed up.

				This site, and it&#039;s creators, have done everything they could to protect us from each other.&nbsp; Along with community and solidarity and working friendships, that would naturally come along with these transactions in RL, also comes the ability to fuck each other over.&nbsp; Here we can&#039;t really do that, except in one small way: vendors could fuck over individual buyers by giving their address to LE.&nbsp; But still, here we&#039;re about as protected as you can be.<br /><br />So no, we can&#039;t have a pool, or anything else that would link us to each other...the logistics alone would be a way to hang somebody.&nbsp; I feel responsible, and if I got cracked in some way related to here, I&#039;d call somebody or another that I trust and would have them attempt to log on and tell people that they busted me...but most people probably wouldn&#039;t believe this anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />No, here we&#039;re on our own, we&#039;re not really all that &#039;tight&#039; of a group at all.&nbsp; Sometimes it feels that way, but I know it&#039;s an illusion.&nbsp; You take off for a few weeks and people move on, forget you existed.&nbsp; It&#039;s called a &#039;community&#039; but that&#039;s just for lack of a better word.&nbsp; Really, it&#039;s not.

				The smartest thing for vendors to do is to have some hidden back up cash. When i was younger and growing dope i always had a legal fund.&nbsp; Once i had paid for the initial set up costs my next couple of crops (approx $10k) went into a box buried in the ground, hidden at grandma&#039;s, wherever your secret spot is (away from the rest of your gear/cash obviously).<br /><br />If you were unlucky and got busted (i got busted) then you would be able to have some cash for a solicitor.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.

				I too am all for&nbsp; making a donation to such a cause. perhaps make it an option at every every purchase asking if you wish to donate to the SR lets call it &quot;resources if needed&quot;&nbsp; fund. Maybe like 1/4 a coin each buy or something. Of course all up to the individual though .<br /><br />I also think that should anything ever happen to any of us here that such a fund should only be used&nbsp; &nbsp;one customers/venders of solid reputations and no tarnishes and undeniable proof&nbsp; that either has at any time been dishonest is misleading about their warez or&nbsp; the delivery of ant item.<br /><br />The only draw back to me is how do we actually know any such person if and when&nbsp; they are ever in legal trouble truly is who he/she says and is a member of our community?

				If anyone here has the resources and an intelligent enough attorney I would suggest setting up a dummy corporation with such a long paper trail&nbsp; nothing can be traced back. Such a company could have a insurance policy in place or even&nbsp; check into the laws of having a fund of their own making that donates to those convicted by the law of nonviolent drug offense&#039;s.<br /><br />Perhaps some one here has a connection George Soros or some other powerful&nbsp; individual who supports the free will of drug use.

				If I were going to use someone to do a job for me that might cause me or an innocent person or persons harm if the person was forced or other wise leaked the information and what he was/is doing then I would not let that individual know what he or she was doing it. It is not a lie if you truly think it is the truth.&nbsp; <br /><br />That is why corrupt officials and those with power are so dangerous if they are immoral and motivated by&nbsp; things of self gratitude or things that are self serving. When it comes to Gov&nbsp; nothing will ever be good for ALL people there will always be a law in place that&nbsp; annoys someone.

				&quot;It is not a lie if you truly think it is the truth. &quot; Keep believing that , see what happens .<br /><br />Freedom was and still is nothing but an illusion for the most part.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;In response to those. A DEA agent for example there is one I am sure that truly believes&nbsp; he is defending the truth&nbsp; when he is told the war on drugs is noble and helpful. He is taught this and programed this so he believes this to be the truth. A persons truths are dictated by his beliefs which in turn are dictated by what he has been programed/taught to believe such birth. The truth to me is that the moon is round. If I had been taught to believe it square and&nbsp; know it as a square since birth I would argue up and don till death it is a square as I have no choice.<br /><br />The difference between the example I made of the moon and of what a LEO does defending these corrupt laws is that by me thinking the moon and knowing the moon to be square for a FACT cause that is all I have been taught in turn hurts no one. The moon just hangs there. My belief is still my belief&nbsp; &nbsp;and I may still consider it fact but IT HURTS NO ONE AND IT HARMS NO ONES PROPERTY<br /><br />While the agent at large if if a sane and stable mind can see the destruction and the harm and pain it brings on others&nbsp; &nbsp;and innocents especially children. and they continue to uphold and defend it&nbsp; knowing&nbsp; that it hurts others.<br /><br />It is in that act that makes one immoral and wrong and the other just a persons belief
