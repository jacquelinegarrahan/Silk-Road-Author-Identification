				Yesterday, I placed a few posts that have been gone now.<br />I could give good and negative karma and had about 106 posts behind my name.<br />Am I being censured and sounds this familiar?<br />I have not been notified in any way.<br />Strange!<br /><br />After been set back to less then 100 post, do I have now again over 100 post and still can not give karma.<br />Yesterday I could!<br />EDIT, now i do see the negative and good again.
