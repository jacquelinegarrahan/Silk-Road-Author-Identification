				+1 for all the good work you moderators and spam busters do, it&#039;s been a bad day for spam busting today. Hopefully one day (fingers crossed) they&#039;ll be gone for good. Until then, thank-you, and please keep up the spam busting! :)

				i guess you dont understand, but it is like this constantly - theres only one spam buster and a few mods that actively remove the spam<br /><br />i was just up for 36 hours straight (besides the couple hours i nodded out :) ) trying to keep the boards clear with help of only a couple other members <br /><br />but then i fall asleep about 12 hours ago and evidently no others were available to remove the spam for a period of the day and everyone freaks out? <br /><br />its like this everyday... just today there was evidently a time where we overlapped not being on to take care of it <br /><br />everyone advertising their willingness to help need to realize its a constant battle and you have to devout a ton of time and have incredible patience because as soon as you delete 150 threads there will be another 200 that have appeared. i dont think most people are actually cut out for it - i know there are even a couple people with the ability to remove it but just ignore it because they arent willing to put forth the effort, but i agree there is only a few members now that are actively willing and able to help. so a couple more people who are established members that are on for a large portion of everyday and have the patience to handle it could benefit the community - not these people with like 50 posts though who are on a couple hours every so often, there is too much room for abuse of the privileges and they havent shown a dedication to the community to deserve the position

				Can&#039;t the mods put a CAPCTHA on the log in page to stop the spam bots from doing this? Like on the actual SR site. Would that work?

				If people are truly fed up perhaps it&#039;s best to not try to defend against them, but to instead attack.<br /><br />If SR user collectively punish their spamming by attacking them on the clear-net I&#039;d expect they&#039;ll go away.<br /><br />If enough people DDOS attack them for awhile even it doesn&#039;t knock off their servers they would pay bandwidth costs wouldn&#039;t they?<br /><br />Or perhaps we can attempt to get their domain name revoked for lack of required contact info per the terms of Yahoo&#039;s service agreement.<br /><br />http://www.whois.com/whois/btkoin.com<br /><br />I am not the expert in these areas, I expect there are many of you who know far more than I.&nbsp; So network experts &amp; hacker types: what attacks can SR throw at them to threaten their business?<br /><br />Bob

				to remove those thousand threads i just had to go through and click a thousand buttons not just one :) <br /><br />and i meant the spam busters have powers that arent allowed to use which could be abused and really mess up the forum - so they need to be an established, trustworthy member. also what i was suggesting is most people would get frustrated and give up trying to remove them as many actually have...&nbsp; not that they arent capable of going through and deleting each thread one by one. <br /><br />i am not even a spam buster anymore yet still actively keep the forum clear. we only have one active spam buster and they hadnt even logged in since all those threads were posted... <br /><br />and i agree, if people want this to stop - other members have already posted what to do to target the site at paypal and the ISP... you dont need to make threads complaining about the spam, you need to take action or at least message the admins about the situation. mods have no power to stop the spam
