				12/02/2012 04:34:08 AM UTC - in 5hrs it will have been 72hrs since my transfer going missing, with only a reply from SR to apologies and say it will be sorted soon, this is not good enough, SR has left me stranded owing suppliers money &amp; making me look bad to them. This is not the first time this has happened and doubt it will be the last. I have had many issues with SR in the last 2 months &amp; this has to be the last straw,i am done with this!! <br /><br />In 1-2 weeks time i am leaving SR for good, as i cannot work with my funds being held from me for 72hrs reducing in value &amp; not knowing if i will ever even get them. it is evident from SR support&#039;s reply that they themselves can do nothing and they are waiting for DPR to come online and &quot;sort&quot; the situation which they claim will be tonight. the whole thing is an unprofessional joke &amp; now many members on the forums are talking about receiving 10x the amount of BTC that they actually withdrew, WHAT THE FUCK!!!!<br /><br />Whats the point in letting SR earn a commission on my sales when i don&#039;t actually get to see the BTC myself!!! DPR sort your shit out, this place has gone down hill so much, i use to like working from here now it is a chore &amp; i hardly update my menu or list even a 1/3 of the items of have to hand.

				I&#039;ve been here a week and it&#039;s been hell. Lost over a grand. Some people are getting double or triple the coins while other are losing like me. Also the reply that I would be funded never happened. I think joining might have been a mistake and the worst timing.

				This is a damn shame to see you going, i have tried some of your budder from a friend of mine who ordered and it was ammaaaazing. I was going to try and order some this coming week, one assumes your not taking orders now though.<br /><br />Would you still be doing a MOM service? i know this is a trust issue but i&#039;d be willing for that amazing product.<br /><br />i hope you can resolve everything, would be a shame to loose possibly the best UK seller we have.<br /><br />kind regards<br />firewoot

				I have operated an underground MoM service in the UK for longer than SR has been on the go, and i will continue to do so for probably longer than SR will be on the go for!!!<br /><br />As mentioned in my profile, customers will please need to contact me with their email &amp; key.<br /><br />chances are DPR will ban me from SR for trying to take customers with me or something similar , but i am beyond caring and i am not putting up with the BS on here any longer.<br /><br />someone suggested the vendors strike, i fucking quit!!!<br /><br />

				Look obviously you&#039;re angry, so maybe it would be sensible to get away from here for 24 hours.<br /><br />Then write a list of fors/againsts and make up your mind. I really think patience will pay you an excellent dividend though.

				there is more chance of a FED ordering from me on SR that there is one coming round to my house to try and buy cannabis, especially since i don&#039;t sell locally, even to friends!!<br /><br />I am a strictly online vendor who worked from the privacy of email, now i am in the public domain, putting myself at more risk.

				ok you have a vaild point there. However who cares if feds order from you you should always assume all of your customers are feds anyway. That is what makes anonymity so awesome, the feds can send me money all day for all I care they still can&#039;t trace me lol.

				I don&#039;t blame you, GreenGiant.&nbsp; If you really got banned, that&#039;s fucked up.&nbsp; Merely for voicing (rather, typing) your opinions, which I assure you are the concerns of other vendors as well.&nbsp; Banning someone for speaking his/her mind is tyranny.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t this why the Silk Road was created?&nbsp; In honor of Libertarianism and Agorism?&nbsp; To circumvent the restraints of totalitarianism and an infringement on personal liberties?&nbsp; This reminds me of the &quot;arrests and paranoia&quot; thread that was deleted.&nbsp; I&#039;m losing hope in SR.&nbsp; :(

				I was not banned for speaking my mind(i hope), i was banned because in a moment of anger and frustration i posted on my profile page that i could not use the SR ordering system due too lost transfers and being unable to work under conditions where i had to wait 3 dyas for a response to messages asking for my BTC, i told customers i was leaving SR &amp; to contact me on my email addy with their email addy, so sadly to say i was banned for braking the rules.<br /><br />I do regret what i have done but not for myself, for my customers. I know i have several customers who finalized early on transactions &amp; we are still waiting to see if products arrive, so sadly i will be unable to help these people, or even acknowledge their Pm&#039;s, for this i am sorry. I am also deeply sorry for the 3-4 orders that had been placed over the weekend, sadly these won&#039;t be going out.<br /><br />My biggest regret really is letting customers down, if your order was marked as sent then it has been sent, if it was not marked as sent yet then it has not been sent and i no longer have access to my account.&nbsp; To all my customers i really do apologies, i enjoyed serving all of you, i live for good feedback :)

				Isn&#039;t it odd that you couldn&#039;t get a reply for days on end, yet once you posted a way for your loyal customers to keep in contact, your account was suspended??? Why such quick actions....and without even a &#039;verbal&#039; warning 1st?? <br />I&#039;ve also heard some vendors were given 3X the amount they withdrew, whilst others had 0 show up. I assume DPR hopes dearly they are all honest, and send back the extra?? <br />What rules did you really break? Almost every vendor says to use a certain&nbsp; method to get a hold of them if SR goes down, or some other reasons. Why else do vendors have tormail, and such?

				I think everyone is getting a bit emotional. Do you not think it is in SR&#039;s interest as well? They can&#039;t just be losing sellers or bitcoins. Wouldn&#039;t you want them to fix the problem before sending you coins that might go missing again? We all like guaranteed time tables bu the truth of the matter is it could take time to sort out.<br /><br />My advice is never owe anyone. Don&#039;t sell things you haven&#039;t bought, or vend &#039;day to day&#039; with finances. This way time won&#039;t get you in beef with anyone and you can afford to put your orders on hold until things get sorted out.

				iv delt with green giant loads of times. he is/was the best uk seller by a distance. his weed was always good and he was/is very responsive to pms. <br /><br />personally i think some of the bud sold by other uk sellers is poor in comparison. and some of the claims of medical grade are a joke.<br /><br />sr is a poorer place without vendors like green giant.&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t seen too many reports of missing coins on SR, and we need to remember how many sellers there are on SR, and how many transactions take place here every day.&nbsp; Glitches will happen.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably a pretty tough job to maintain all the smokescreen subterfuges that DPR &amp;co. have to continually oil and adjust to make this place possible.<br /><br />I&#039;m not excusing anything that happened to GG, but before we all freak out, maybe we should all just take it easy.&nbsp; Then again, I&#039;m not the one who&#039;s out a bunch of coin, so I might not have any place to talk.<br /><br />Either way, communication is key.&nbsp; Since we&#039;re all anonymous, communication is the only way anyone who&#039;s missing money is ever going to see it again.&nbsp; I know I&#039;m stating the obvious, but you have to start somewhere.

				Update: Again I&#039;d like to start by apologizing to everyone, in particular SR &amp; DPR. Some of the comments i made about SR &amp; DPR in particular were irrational &amp; written out of anger &amp; frustration. <br />I joined SR and started selling as a social experiment , i was blown away with how well the system worked &amp; how honest SR buyers &amp; staff were, I was instantly drawn in. <br />What DPR &amp; SR staff have created here is a great thing, it has taken so much time and effort to get to where SR is today &amp; we all know the dangers involved for them, I really admire what DPR has set out to achieve &amp; how much the system has evolved. <br />&nbsp;I truly do regret the rants regarding the commission applied on the SR system, the place could not work without it and who am i to judge them for this. the small problems that happen every once in a while are nothing when compared to how many other things go right every single day on the SR system. DPR is only human at the end of the day, he can&#039;t be everything to everyone, but he is certainly doing a good job trying &amp; he has my support.

				Sorry GreenGiant, I feel you man. Less and less product is going up each day, kind of making me sad. But there isn&#039;t really an incentive for sellers, not only do they have to pay to set up their accounts but they also have to pay their tax in order to sell. That combined with the money being lost with withdrawal problems and bitcoin fluctuation is enough to make anyone crack. Rather money being gained money is disappearing, as well being lost and that&#039;s just not cool. Seller&#039;s really have been taking a beating lately, but on behalf of the buyers on the road, WE DO APPRECIATE YOU GUYS!!! <br /><br />Good look in your future endeavors GreenGiant.

				Wow, that&#039;s a complete flip from your stance on this thread, as well as another. It&#039;s also a bit out of character for you. Just seemed a bit fishy to be so irate and pissed for days, to instantly exonerating DPR &amp; SR. Not just once, but twice. However, not in the other thread. One would think that you&#039;d think to go over and apologize on that thread as well. <br />My point? Maybe I don&#039;t have one that justifies your rationalization of what I should say, and so, would of course, be rejected by you upon&nbsp; the first word, but.......what would stop the Dictator from just posting from a banned account that everything is now hunky dory?<br />I have no clue, just sayin&#039;........................

This is from threads prior to the BTC fiasco.<br />I guess i will have to read over some of my previous forum posts before my missing BTC issues, i have never meant to come across as a &quot;prick&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br />In regards to my apology, what i wrote i considered i very shortened version from the full blown epic novel i could have written explaining the ins and out of my online life &amp; real life which led to me being so irate. My comment in regards to the troll is because someone posted on the thread saying i had scammed them $200!!! hence why i bit back!! The post regarding the $200 was cleaned by staff i guess when getting rid of spam round the forums. <br /><br />edit: also the twist this thread has taken in 2-3 members heads cracks me up ;D, you guys should write for Hollyoaks(a shit UK soap opera with dramatic plots).<br />Damitri you rock, keep up the good work! i&#039;ve always loved you comment under your user rank makes me smile every time&nbsp; ;D<br />

He couldn&#039;t have been more helpful for me being a newbie buyer, helped me out with pgp and was patient when i mucked it up. <br /><br />There&#039;s no doubt in my mind that GG is legit and it couldn&#039;t have been a better starting point for my journey on the silk road.
