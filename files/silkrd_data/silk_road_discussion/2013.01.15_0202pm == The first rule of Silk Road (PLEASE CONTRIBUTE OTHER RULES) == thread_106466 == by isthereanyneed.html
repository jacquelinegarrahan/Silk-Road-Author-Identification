				In my humble opinion I think the first and one of the most important rule of Silk Road is simply DO NOT tell any one that you use SR if you do tell people where you get your products things could get complicated for a number of reasons which I have listed below....<br /><br />* People have got loose lips and loose lips sink ships.<br /><br />* When your using the best product around then some one knows this they could be a friend or merely a friend of a friend these people could quite easily become jealous that you have got the good shit and they have got either nothing or just plain old rubbish that they have to source off the street then when you choose not to share your product with them they could then either turn GRASS/RAT or they could just start shouting their mouth off and some one who is a grass/rat could find out, people can become nasty when they don&#039;t get what they want in life.<br /><br />* The more people know the higher the chances of LE officers taking note of whats happening ie.. people putting up posts on other forums bragging about their SR products and how easy it was this is not the attitude of an SR community user its these people who brag about their buys either on forums across the web or else where in real life that bring unwanted attention here.<br /><br />* Its very easy to get carried in this little world buying the best product around but please never become content never tell any one what you are doing if you must tell some one make sure its only a spouse or some one close to you that you trust.<br /><br />In summary, don&#039;t get carried away with buys and don&#039;t think that no one cares what you are doing its this carelessness that brings unwanted attention, those people who already know how to use SR correctly well there is no need to read this thread because you are the elite the ones that are setting the standards but those who are new to SR please remember DO NOT tell any one that you use SR and if every one keeps everything on the down low every thing in your life will be good and nothing bad will happen, you must choose it use it but don&#039;t abuse it.<br /><br />If you remember this type of attitude through out your Silk Road use everything else on the road will sort of fall into place.<br /><br />Please feel free to add your rules to using Silk Road in this thread and lets keep the road safe and secure.

				I &#039;d say avoid bulk orders. <br />I know we re not all here for the same reason, some are resellers, but if you re here for personal use, everything is worse with medium/big orders. The stress while waiting, the amount of money you can lose if something goes wrong, and the possibility of a control delivery/more serious charges. You save some money with bulk but for me it&#039;s not worth the risk getting caught with a heavy package.

				Be fair to the vendors - if your package doesn&#039;t turn up, don&#039;t run around, screaming:<br /><br />&quot;AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH! SCAMMER! HE STOLE ALL MY BTC AND RAPED MY WIFE AHHHHHHHHHHHHH BANISH THE SEWER DWELLER FROM THE ROAD!!!!!<br /><br /><br />....<br /><br />.. Why is he still here I clearly told you all he was a scammer!!!!! Obviously all the positive feedback he is getting is faked from himself, if he is not banned I will kill myself&quot;<br /><br />Simply have a chat with them, try to sort it out - most vendors will be perfectly fair.

If you just want a discount, it&#039;s not worth buying a pound of grass to achieve said discount. However I do think anything under a pound for bulk resale isn&#039;t too terrible. Just make sure the vendor ships USPS and they just drop it at the door, no sig required. Should be fine then.

				From the individual&#039;s point of view, if LE are going to the trouble of arresting you for personal possession then their eyes will also lightthefuckup if you say &quot;oh btw officer, I didn&#039;t get it from some random on the street I don&#039;t know or couldn&#039;t identify but bought it all online so there&#039;re probably some decent, hard electronic records of all my transactions just waiting to be discovered&quot;.<br /><br />However, this isn&#039;t secret anymore. Apart from that Gawker article, the Wikipedia entry containing screenshots &amp; an onion link to the site etcetcetc, this was in The Economist last September:<br /><br />&quot;But another big reason for the currency’s success is its role in dodgy online markets. Although tracing Bitcoin transactions to real people is not impossible, the currency’s relative anonymity and ease of use makes it a natural conduit for criminal funds. On the website Silk Road, a sort of eBay for drugs hidden in a dark corner of the web known as Tor, Bitcoins are the only means of transaction. Buyers transfer their Bitcoins into an escrow account where they sit until receipt of the goods is confirmed. Bitcoin transactions on Silk Road are now worth $1.9m per month, estimates Nicolas Christin, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University.&quot;

				If your a new buyer don&#039;t FE<br /><br />Always read the vendors profile and use PGP. Establish communication and gain an understanding if there&#039;s any questions BEFORE your order gets placed/processed. PGP shows you have done a fair bit of research on the security side<br /><br />As a seller - maintain integrity over greed. Help each other out follow the rules and everything will be fine. Remember the biggest sellers attract the biggest scams (therefor feedback score maybe inaccurate).<br /><br />Promote responsible use by adopting a harm reduction attitude and do your own research on any chemical you decide to yourself.<br /><br />Drugs are fun&nbsp; but dependance and addiction suck (physical or psychological).

				How did everyone find out about SR then??<br /><br />Surely someone told them??<br /><br />Personally 99.9% of the time I don&#039;t say a word, but I think selective and discreet discussion could attribute to the community in a positive way, I was pretty enlightened when I was privileged with the information and try to repay that as much as possible with my ethic and conduct.<br /><br />But common sense is required (yet often not used).<br /><br />The militant in me wants this thing to subversively get as big as humanly possible, as with some solidarity things can be changed, this may be a utopian ideal, but hey all it takes is a collective dream.
