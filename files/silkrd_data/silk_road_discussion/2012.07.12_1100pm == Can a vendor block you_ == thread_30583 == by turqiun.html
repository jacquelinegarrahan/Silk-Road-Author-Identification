				I&#039;m not going to say the vendor&#039;s name out of respect but I finally found a vendor with the pills I wanted at a great price. I messaged him a day ago but he never responded. I should also mention that I didn&#039;t use the GPG code cause I wasn&#039;t sure how to use it so would that be a reason why this vendor wouldn&#039;t respond? Then early this morning I went ahead a placed the order for what I wanted. I just got a message from SR support saying the vendor cancelled my order. I sent him another message not using the coded key asking to why it was cancelled. I doubt I will get a message back but the strange thing is I don&#039;t see him as a vendor anymore. He had a very good reputation from his stats and had positive reviews as early as this morning. It&#039;s like he just disappeared. He sold quite a few items but I don&#039;t see his name anywhere anymore lol. So was I blocked from seeing him or is it possible he just retired? I&#039;m still new to this place so I don&#039;t know the ends and outs yet, bare with me. Thanks guys in advance.

				No we can&#039;t but we can use stealth or just cancel your orders until you get the message lol. If the vendor has just disappeared then they have gone into stealth, if you get your orders cancelled a bunch of times then you aren&#039;t on their Christmas card list lol.

				This happened to me recently. Vendor cancelled my order and I could no longer find him. It just turned out he ran out of gear and went into stealth mode.

				turqiun, you really ought to be using GPG, it may not be part of the site infrastructure, but that is *only* because it cannot be without also compromising the point of PGP encryption (because this would force SR to store information which if SR was compromised, would allow LE to recover all communications sent afterwards). <br /><br />My point is that encryption is *not* an optional feature of SR. It is mandatory in order to do business professionally as a vendor and to be respected as a client.<br /><br />Learn how to use GPG and if your vendor has stock you&#039;ll almost certainly be in business, a lot of vendors will justly feel leery of customers not using it.<br /><br />Step 1: Find the vendor&#039;s public key on his profile.<br />Step 2: Download GPG. <br />Step 3: Copy-paste the public key into a text file, you can use any extension I believe, but most people save the file as .gpg or similar.<br />Step 4: Import the public key into GPG.<br />Step 5: Write your email to the vendor (known as plaintext).<br />Step 6: Click the Encrypt button and select the vendor&#039;s public key to use.<br />Step 7: Collect the encrypted text and email it to the vendor.<br /><br />If you want to practice using GPG, then ask and we&#039;ll do a &#039;dry run&#039; or two here in this thread.<br /><br />Here is a new PGP key I have made. Try sending an encrypted message in this thread back to me. And tell me what everybody&#039;s favorite animal is! Yes! Yes it is!<br /><br />--<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQGNBFAAuD4BDAC3OD9erwVn20hKzHKdoJodd0kdv+bIvmsdEDehUNATAvDDxtrB<br />ppd3LOwQN2ku1EfWdu+o6CEGW8sFgzg5M1slEdj6pXwWOxvGPbaMfc9GGEaVujEc<br />wsd0yxEVKc5PO2YULSWDcZJme7/cojYVApi7RH5t38iXPA86TiPpEKWXAks5BZq8<br />V+LvyWHqKXhLVcPz72x+PBw8HKdeVma4IFvUhkSN4p3lRBq4KLrdk+XWNsc+86N/<br />InztMYvNVXISW0PbJ/NLeZ4tfPitMoKTiGYLZ+mIR9Ea8yr30Jw4gdUc1yqdzi38<br />nkwyQNajA8bGJUdTFNddXYggjc4d2s8BMtVRdl3MY0TX0yEuRTEdS4bszX/+S689<br />UMkNYx2AydVnTnxYVWekfPX2Ksm56x41Lb056Y3tlow+0YyzeU8HBHBo8hisVAla<br />bTOV629rY/HSOApXrpLqubgCkdBtjJ1qh8qY6q9AzucJpBLYrwifSbDDwQSLQYgC<br />2noCqiGamAHydXMAEQEAAbRTYW1hemluZyBwaW5lIChUaGUgTGxhbWEgaXMgZXZl<br />cnlib2R5J3MgZmF2b3JpdGUgYW5pbWFsKSA8bm9zdWNoZW1haWxAbm93aGVyZS56<br />YW1hbD6JAbgEEwECACIFAlAAuD4CGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheA<br />AAoJEAri5Z3a/+bjGb0L/3xUNOutU74XmyTwQ3ZZVDMqDYf3PX6qKfA5SEdMuql7<br />+3I1kVYtDJn0aY09LsIPofGc0gSF0ZXFTVdA6l19S+Aivoe1j15BvE4mLrRl/MeT<br />WoyT69Nr+1zQH9VmldgFpPZV0DeRBvPYVa0k0+ErTftnoPa7bIgbNmP2KeodEgHr<br />Uj7EoPmJtgwD+WM9eQClyPI/2RrR115qGjMnjFYWe30GsvbJ+K6mdECDntHqsKEn<br />mYc5JLV9TnwhIrL6p+bIuTb2RvSyId7QVl67MskuRWGYqjJIuvO2A1cyIVTBwAgb<br />ze12GBtapuPOzqYTfZ2NIoy+U+IOr0GLZAJsoHw4kMEzsOjmwb/9aYaXbt4aIZk2<br />w02N37wSSYcvXXTqFhNz9BTlFBkWw9slTTF0jpDQvQEnz0TVIrAEAyLrSx5QmL6t<br />zgXr0gQCYLzf8/vMkuwZNRijo38wHSAPRM4VcBCnd0UQEWN6hLPFzPAPa9XTLPr7<br />hA7v+Tj2TRw+UPALHqr0SrkBjQRQALg+AQwAuzdMmuHx4uVytXbxi70y7yw+kFMA<br />jmVFqRDm/OUPDB5vnqZIjmcGUQwH7DciSK60UiLyy5io9dZ7vEDZk8Kf8r5cMDxS<br />JQi7Ruag8/in4N5DZP3JM3Y0/cJkoSkgifJfaekd3IxfuFrZeuQ+7UNpGbRBe6n5<br />cXaWecuCtaUF2esMlaskIt9YaYFdm7OhYROUZCqB9aYttm9TD7eFq1ozjTbO1MS1<br />9O9Zfeqx1L8fKt7drOZdMpyJhsQzqX4+N7c0c3lEtk+LG9vDA28cP65UvTibEGIE<br />7FXrkRADmWt+E/Ef/4E0XYJXRddX9psBqmHjuRNgxoah4p8uKn/eNYI9kTwIdX0K<br />MtKINkV1bRtwLmLWDbSp1wI7Eo/FWHZbZC96Gig3zTVkAjZYjlBdmMVLGIAjscwp<br />ZEIIyBUnqu+qwWOu25DzVf2RwaIgNMfLTOz+IVAiUk8esfRADytmep5W9vKqYd8P<br />Qs0CkMWvWSkEnCoVakbnkp/qj0AYxKXEWEepABEBAAGJAZ8EGAECAAkFAlAAuD4C<br />GwwACgkQCuLlndr/5uMxSwv/Z9lZAVUQr6HgxhoNz5QfyPOwHVDobNtd4Sd6KUXa<br />VDY1dzVRaXbGhE5WfxBqKBJ5bjc5p7M4tgQbcbiOafh5uac3f+PUYhajNahEUptj<br />uG8E0+SztgAJWZg1yaTagisihnUTxjHJGVysDH+Y4JMsmkMQ7kOat/7BEP6Uq4nB<br />GRpc6/leoyHlrSK1QANh1IdWJytZY248/IN2Ny1yHdHm0SKGZgBapcyanerXQwEd<br />f0kWC9tZ7v/iul14Szqwz9st44kJEnlDCbvns0UsHXPoXIXoq7dnBObWf5pYDnwV<br />BVUO3B7JWCfsHTgznVMmE8y/Jo2Mgte5PSz5kzTdkRF2l9onM+do6na8+afTeIed<br />J37o4fTEttzyB4rOdToC/v30KrkG62SJ/SMne/N1O41XAFZVDZY/+oQUNtQK/Y6D<br />KpJN5Ez8yjy6psJy71CY54LLN1As7gmmoD1OESBIcDZ2PUtQV7hr3/X4Roh2LyGn<br />GcKI6cfpR6ea9F1OTZslCRRp<br />=EnDU<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />
