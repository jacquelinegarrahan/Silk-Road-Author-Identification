				&nbsp;I&#039;m getting very nervous that my $800.00 worth of drugs isn&#039;t going to arrive from a domestic vender shipping to a domestic address with real name&nbsp; used... I KNOW the address was entered correctly and we use a locked key access mail box so its not possible it would get stolen.&nbsp; <br /><br />The vender is claiming that he&#039;s having problems with USPS (there&#039;s alot more to his USPS claims but not worth getting into really). He&#039;s saying that he&#039;s having problems with all his shipments arriving late and to hold tight.&nbsp; He keeps posting things on his page every few days assuring everybody things are ok but my gut is starting to tell me differently after his most recent post and several in depth internet searches into USPS shipping delays which mostly say they&#039;ve fixed problems they were having months before. <br /><br />If he can&#039;t prove that my package made it to my town/address to SR resolution how long does it typically take to be resolved by SR??<br /><br />I have $5.00 shy of 7k worth of transactions and I have 1.1k &quot;In transit&quot; as I type this.<br /><br />Who has experience with SILK ROAD resolving a problem like this? I&#039;M NOT interested in hearing your stories about how this vender or that vender worked shit out with you behind the scenes yada yada... I&#039;m talking about an official resolve that is resolved by SR.<br /><br />Thanks and I look forward to your responses!!<br /><br />

				I&#039;m inclined to believe that the vendor will sort it out. He has admitted that he is having problems with usps, and good job for staying in escrow!<br /><br />SR usually only steps in if the vendor does not reply to the resolution or you guys can not agree on a solution

				Thanks for your responses.<br /><br />LOL, i&#039;m not running a scam.&nbsp; Things are working out well enough for me as an established buyer trust me ;) <br /><br />People are starting to report receiving their packages or getting full refunds (they are slowly trickling in).&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to jump the gun/act like an asshole so I&#039;ve been patient and polite with the vender thus far but I did just ask for a tracking number yesterday as it had been one week since package was listed ad being &quot;in transit&quot; + I messaged him to double check that the package actually made it into the mail on that over the weekend.&nbsp; It was ordered on a wednesday, &quot;in transit&quot; last thursday but as of yesterday it still wasn&#039;t here :( .. I&#039;m near the east coast but even packages coming from west coast have arrived quicker than this.&nbsp; All that being said its only been 1 week.&nbsp; I&#039;m asking these questions because I like to have a clear game plan for what I&#039;ll do / what my game plan is ahead of time instead of being in a panic when shit hits the fan. <br /><br />I&#039;m inclined to believe people on SR especially venders with over 300 transactions and a rating of 99-100 ... his only just now dropped lower from a few pissed off buyers who got what they weren&#039;t expecting, had their shipment lost and had also FE&#039;d etc... I can understand though if I was vender doing thousands of dollars worth of business a day not really caring/being too worried about some Smeegle complaining about his 1 gram of MDMA/ICE not arriving especially if I&#039;ve planned to re-ship it all along.<br /><br />He&#039;s been constantly updating his vender page assuring and re-assuring people everything is ok, that its USPS and he&#039;s not scamming people.. I FEEL like he&#039;s being honest and the shit&#039;s just running super behind due to USPS... hearing some of you say that USPS has been fucking up over the last week or two does make me feel better.&nbsp; That being said on his vender page some people have posted &quot;don&#039;t order from this guy, I just got something and it was 100% cut&quot; but said nothing more to explain what it was he ordered and if he meant &quot;this was 100% fake&quot; or just to say &quot;I&#039;m 100% sure it was cut&quot;... it was an aggressive accusatory statement but didn&#039;t offer much in the way of an explanation.&nbsp; <br /><br />This whole Silk Road system is set up the way it is for a reason.&nbsp; I guess I need to just trust the system and sit tight which is easy to do when you know you&#039;ve done everything exactly how you should (Correct address, real name, locked mail box, no FE etc...).&nbsp; Absolute worst case his shipment doesn&#039;t arrive and I get a re-fund... After all this bullshit there&#039;s no way I&#039;d want him to re-ship thats for damn sure.&nbsp; At this point I just want the shit in the mailbox and or my money back!! :)<br /><br />Thanks again for your responses, <br /><br />-Bill Paxton

				ITEMS RECEIVED.&nbsp; NEVER FE!!!!! MDMA and OXY&#039;s came no problem-o just 8 days after marked in transit. <br /><br />People who have FE&#039;d with this vender seem to have been selectively scammed but that may not even be the case.<br /><br />I spoke with local business owners in my city and they all expressed to me that USPS has been shipping slower than ever the last week or two.<br /><br />What mostly scared me wasn&#039;t the fact that product was taking so long.&nbsp; What scared me was that buyer&#039;s and the vender kept making such a big deal about everything running late.&nbsp; Buyer&#039;s on here are so damn quick to start slinging mud and&nbsp; calling people names etc... Its funny really how everybody acts so nice but when their product gets to be late or something goes wrong its like the whole world is against them.<br /><br />Lesson of this story? NEVER FE. <br /><br />-Bill Paxton&nbsp;
