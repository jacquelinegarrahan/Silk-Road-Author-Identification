				&nbsp; Could I sell a product on SR without having to win the auction or pay a fee to become a seller?&nbsp; I have no desire to sell full time on SR, but have a product that I don&#039;t use and I&#039;m sure someone would like to buy.&nbsp; Is this type of selling permitted? I&#039;d gladly pay SR a percentage.<br />

				I don&#039;t know how SR would feel about it but if you&#039;re really just going to have a once a month or whatever scrip and sell it to one person every month that you met here?&nbsp; Just make a 5% donation to SR and have a clear conscience that you didn&#039;t rip off the guy who helped you find a person for your meds.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have to be rocket science, I guess. :)&nbsp; IMHO.<br /><br />That said, if you&#039;ve got opiates, you should pm me.&nbsp; Ditto with benzos. cheers! ;)

				I am wondering the same thing mr roll, I have certain recurring surplus which would be nice to unload but at the current price of seller acct it is quite prohibitive.&nbsp; I&#039;d appreciate any and all insight.

				I appreciate the responses from you two.&nbsp; Actually I do have an opiate, but it&#039;s only a partial opiate agonist...suboxone.&nbsp; I have a sealed box of thirty film strips that I&#039;m not going to use anymore.

				I think it would be great but the nature of trust means vendors should have something at stake. You do not want a situation where a cop could put up a listing&nbsp; without any reputation and no cost just to harvest buyer addresses, not caring if the transaction is canceled or refunded. <br /><br />

				The problem with not paying the fee, as you all know, is to protect the buyer from potential scammers. Scammers don&#039;t live for long on the road and the registering fee is the best way to protect us. I&#039;m not really in favor of that.

				Find a seller who is selling a similar product and ask them if they want to buy it.
