				I am growing increasingly frustrated trying to get my business back to where it was before all the SR downtime. When I am able to access SR it seems very fast, but I am never able to access SR during the day time. Which causes me to have to be awake all night if I want to work on SR, something that can&#039;t continue. I just don&#039;t understand how anyone is able to get online during the day, or are they? I try and try but get Connection timed out. It stopped working for me at appx 8am this morning. I was right in the middle of updating my profile, adding a listing for a new product, and attempting to reply to everyone.<br /><br />If there&#039;s something I can do to allow me to get on during the day please guide me in that direction. For those of you that are able to get on during the day, what might you be doing differently? You can PM me if you do not want the info to be public.

				Just got to try and keep calm and do something productive to take your mind off it. Check back every hour or 2. No way to get on when it&#039;s down.

				It&#039;s by no means a solution, but I find that sometimes hitting &quot;Use a New Identity&quot; in vidalia allows me to get back on after I&#039;ve been kicked out. worth a try at least!
