				A Little about Dr. White....A Semi-Biography<br /><br />Hi Folks, <br /><br />Many of you know me as&nbsp; Dr. White but most just call me DOC. That&#039;s OK though! (The Back to the future movies are one of my favorites ever! So? what&#039;s a little ego tickling once in a while? Anyway, let&#039;s cut to the chase.&nbsp; I can&#039;t divulge my age but let&#039;s just say the first commercially viable compact disc gained traction and became a success duo to its hi fidelity sound after cassettes around the time I was born. As most have already suspected due to my organization and general attention to detail yes I work in a respectable position. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />As you may have already guessed. I am a Doctor/PHD in real life! I know that has been bugging people for quite some time. When I just started on SR I just sold weed, so it was kind of&nbsp; funny because my name did not match my product lol. Truth Is I have sold coke for 8 years, I just started to sell coke on SR about 3 months ago. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hardest thing I have ever done is go to medical school and sell drugs at the same time. Good thing I had clients with money, mostly doctors and lawyers (ironic) I have had people ask me how are you paying for school, I told people only if they asked. Even selling dope, I wasn&#039;t making enough to pay for school. Finally, after 8 years of medical including 2 years of prerequisites that I was able to complete during High School. Then 2 more years of prerequisites. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in All I spent 8 years in medical school not including 4 years of prerequisites. After school I was stressed and burdened by a ton of medical school and prerequisite loans. I graduated with my Doctorate with a PH/D General Practicing Doctor with a specialty in pharmaceuticals.&nbsp; I quickly found out that going into pharmaceuticals as a major was the biggest mistake I made. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with that said I am anticipating some of your thought processes and questions as to why I would spend so much Time, Studying, and Energy&nbsp; just to sell drugs. In many ways it is what appears to be a polar opposite. However as I will elaborate on below. They are quite similar indeed.<br />Question&#039;s Posted Towards Dr. White<br />Added 2/16<br />1. (Q) Since you went to medical school, couldn&#039;t you make big bucks doing brain surgery or something?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (A) Not exactly, my field at the hospital I started at needed a doctor with the ability to diagnose and&nbsp; prescribe patients with medical conditions ranging from physical conditions such as shingles (which not much can be done about, even with today&#039;s technology) to depression, even people with multiple personalities. Many were fakers and since my psychology was always weak I would often request a skilled psychologist to assist me in diagnosis. <br />2 (Q) How did you get from being a Doctor in the medical profession to&nbsp; selling drugs?<br />This will have to be a two part answer:<br />(A) The things I have seen with regard to what pharmaceutical drugs do compared to the various scheduled &quot;illegal&quot; Drugs. Pharmaceutical drugs are the absolute epiphany of what is wrong with people. I saw countless people manipulated into talking prescription pills because the &quot;magic&quot;&nbsp; pill would help them and &quot;help feel normal again&quot;&nbsp; That is fine and dandy, but I have overheard conversation about drugs that are engineered to develop side effect or simply lose their effect and then a higher dose is require to achieve the same results or in some cases another prescription is required. Then there is the&nbsp; possibility that the two may interact if not properly studied for potential interactions. A good friend of mine has an ex-wife (just divorced) who was on 8 or 9 different prescription drugs. She is now useless she cannot drive because it makes her too anxious and cannot hold down a job. The pharmaceutical drug combinations have messed her up so bad. So to answer your question, the illegal drugs are actually safer in many ways. I mean, no drug is good for you but given what I have seen at working as an intern and actually prescribing pills with a doc supervising of course.....Let&#039;s just say you don&#039;t want to see a perfectly functioning person deteriorate within a few years, sometimes less. A bad combination is pain killers and anti-depressants. If you don&#039;t have a doctor that knows or cares then you&#039;re in trouble. <br />(B) I saw a demand for drugs that I researched that helped people that were deemed illegal:<br />For Example:<br />Marijuana:&nbsp; Has excellent relieving properties (as many of you already know), Not to mention the ability for Marijuana to reduce or eliminate nausea for those that are going through chemotherapy for Cancer. Marijuana in my opinion is NOT physically addictive, There have been more studies on this subject than the hairs on my chin.&nbsp; However, Psychologically; it is extremely addictive. This I believe is the reason that&nbsp; the craving for a smoker to have a cigarette&nbsp; ( the addiction cannot be&nbsp; simply attributed to the tobacco (like American Spirit which makes cigarettes that are supposedly chemical free.<br /><br />Thanks for the questions....<br /><br />Since you made it though all that you might as well check out my listings at the bottom of my profile page at this link:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e513ffb50f<br /><br />Respectfully,<br /><br />Dr. White

				You are fucking awesome!<br /><br />So give your position do you have any access to mass spectrography or gas chromotography equipment (sp!) so you could determine the exact cannabinoid content of your herb?
