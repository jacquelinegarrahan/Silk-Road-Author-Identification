				I have a few prescription pills that I don&#039;t use because they don&#039;t work for me. I noticed that a few of these pills are for sale on SR. I am wondering if it would be okay (or against SR rules) to send these pills to someone on the forum in exchange for bitcoins to my account? I won&#039;t actually do this because I can&#039;t imagine anyone would take a risk buying from me and I don&#039;t have that many pills anyway. I&#039;d just want to make sure it would be okay if I did.

				I believe it&#039;s frowned upon here. As there&#039;s no escrow, or anything keeping random forum members from stealing other members&#039; addresses and just running off with them.&nbsp; No insurance via closure of vendor accounts (which i think have to be paid for?)

Just want to know if there&#039;s a rule against it so your account gets banned if you do.

				For selling you need a vendor account. You are not allowed to sell on the forum.

				From my understanding if you do not have a vendor account then NO. It is done and ppl do it&nbsp; but it is frown on, i dont think it will get you kicked off or anything but its not looked at good, nd a vendor account i now know is about 120$ maybe little more, so it would be cheaper for you to sell them around your way... I wasnt aware of this myself until a few days ago cause iv been a member on SR since april&nbsp; but just started using the forms for research on vendors, and sometimes you might run across a new vendor wanting to sne da free sample/samples to people and i think the only way to give a vendor who sends free samples a review is through the rumor mill, I know one got in touch with me and said he couldnt make it where i could give him a rate an review on his vendor page but to do it a rumor mill.. May i ask what kinda pills are they? And the main reason its not a good idea is because it offers no preotection for buyer or sller,I would take the chance transfering my bitcoins and im sure the seller is gonna take a chance sending the meds up front.. Thats why SR has a escrow system,, Also why you never FE they say buyers with no states have to FE But when i was new i was never asked to FE everybody i have decided to deal with i have never had a problem and parcels have come lighting fast with no issue....But i am curious as to what pills u have

				its a test. If you can&#039;t find the link, i&#039;ll give you a hint, It&#039;s not on the forums.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;DPR set up the test to see how badly someone wants to be a vendor.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Oh hell.... I cant keep a secret!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;How about the &quot;become a seller&quot; link on the right hand side of your screen in SR after you click &quot;Account&quot; at the top.?<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;...try there.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				You guise and your vanilla logic.<br />There are no rules in this revolution on freedom but there are guidelines to maintain a healthy revolution.<br />You can not make a thread and freely use silk road servers to sale items on the forum without a Silk Road vendor account this is to protec vendor and client in the transaction.<br />However if one was to sell some one else something here in a private communication between consenting adults it would be no responsibility of Silk Road to help either party no matter the outcome. What don&#039;t know about I can&#039;t moderate and non should I. The catch 22 here is there is a no spamming of any kind PM or in open forum threads.<br />The loophole you have a post signature in which you can say what ever you want except PM me about a purchase concerning random item.<br /><br /><br />If you can deduce the loophole while following guidelines you have a very sketchy situation but it&#039;s your freedom to take responsibility for your own actions and no one elses.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So no selling is allowed in the forum without a SRM vendor account.<br />Figure that out and I or another moderator or admin doesn&#039;t catch you and you might be right for this revolution. The revolution of unlimited boundaries just twisted corridors.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad
