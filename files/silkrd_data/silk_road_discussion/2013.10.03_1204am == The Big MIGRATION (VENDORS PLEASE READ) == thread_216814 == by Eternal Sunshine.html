				I suggest all vendors go to the black market (until a better alternative is available). BMR&#039;s biggest problem at the moment is low quality product and low quality vendors (including a lot of scammers). Their system seems alright and has escrow + rating.&nbsp; Sheep market doesn&#039;t have escrow so that&#039;s a big NO NO.<br /><br />In my opinion, BMR is the place to be selling at the moment. If we get the good vendors from SR on that site, it will drive the bad vendors away in no time.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t also &#039;t care much about the FBI watching this forum, browsing through our PM&#039;s. There are only a very few BIG vendors on SR. I mean, common, where I live they don&#039;t even make a bust if they aren&#039;t sure they are finding a few million X pills or more than 1000kg of cocaine.&nbsp; So even if you managed to make a 100k profit, your still a small fish.<br /><br />Also, the whole investigation is actually a big failure;&nbsp; they wasted almost 3 years of resources (while the world economy was collapsing) to find a guy and confiscate less then 3 million USD in bitcoin. Way to go! And they increased street crime because addicts (for example heroine users) will get their fix anyway so I guess they&#039;ll just rob a store and kill the manager because you took their bitcoins.&nbsp; I suggest everyone stops paying taxes because LE is clearly promoting total anarchy.<br /><br />Silkroad was actually one of the biggest solutions on &quot;the war on drugs&quot; because it disarmed the &quot;soldiers&quot; involved. Governments are&nbsp; just to stupid to see it.<br /><br />To finish I would like to say to the FBI fags reading this topic, it&#039;s not you against one man, it&#039;s not you against 1 website. It&#039;s you against 150 000 individual buyers, get real you&#039;ll never win. DPR I wish you the best of luck but don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ve really started something and in my opinion you changed the world forever.

				Actually sheep does have escrow... And sheep seems way easier/faster to use. BMR seems the opposite in every way. I strongly suggest sheep as the place everyone moves to, though it seems both will battle for the #1 spot

				yeah but I read sheep uses an API (i think it was twitter) which makes it (in my experience) less secure then a custom made system like BMR. <br /><br />BMR also has more experience and the only reason sheep is faster is because they have a small number of vendors/customers. Anyway, I believe their should be a clear choice. I don&#039;t want to order from more than 1 site. I also believe that BMR will improve if they get more traffic. I&#039;m sure they have more technical knowledge then sheep. And they have been around for quite some time. Sheep is still new, might be another Atlantis scenario. <br /><br />Sheep design is cool, but i remember SR looking horrible in the past. As long as it get what I order to my door i&#039;m happy.

				I have a message to the DEA.&nbsp; Stop fucking over your own species.&nbsp; Stop fucking over your own race.&nbsp; Stop fucking over your own countrymen.&nbsp; You might think that drug users are a drain on our society but it is you.&nbsp; You sir, are a drain on society.&nbsp; Alcohol and tobacco&#039;s social costs dwarf those of illegal drugs yet you claim that these substances are the culprits.&nbsp; They are the instruments of moral decay within the utopian society that we can envision.&nbsp; I am having trouble recalling the name of the economist from the Austrian school who came up with the broken windows fallacy.&nbsp; Well, see the unseen, this is not a window you are breaking to stimulate the economy but a PERSON.&nbsp; A FAMILY.&nbsp; A SOCIETY.&nbsp; And you are doing it for the 80k you get a year.&nbsp; The health insurance and the car payment.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give me a song and dance about how drug dealers must be in prison or pay for what they have done.&nbsp; They may pay a little but other people pay multitudes more.<br /><br />You come into people&#039;s homes with your fucking machine guns.&nbsp; You take the parents away from a child.&nbsp; You rectify it by telling yourself they are better off with their parents doing 20 years for that third crack offense.&nbsp; But the child is then aimless.&nbsp; The child receives less attention than he would from parents that are sleeping.&nbsp; The child goes to a boys home where he MUST be TOUGH and becomes exactly what the DOJ is trying to expel from society, a &quot;criminal&quot;.&nbsp; The DEA is rigged to win.&nbsp; In some twisted positive feedback loop by arresting drug users and dealers they just create more.&nbsp; Fucking bureaucrats.

				Sheep doesn&#039;t have any buyer guide and the forum is full of people REQUESTING a escrow system so I just assumed they didn&#039;t have one. <br /><br />Still, sheep is new, runs on an api of a company known to share data with LE and has only a very small community. <br /><br />BMR is a stable custom made system (like SR) and has currently some load balancing issues because of sudden high demand (nobody could be prepared for this). My biggest fear is that there will be clustering. 50/50 buyer spread over both sites and that&#039;s just what the FBI wants off course. Soon we&#039;ll see dealers opening their own private site without any security (encryption/escrow). Sheep is also new, how can you be sure it isn&#039;t a honeypot?<br /><br />I had never heard of it and since SR is down, some people just start yelling USE SHEEP MARKET!!! I&#039;m not saying SHEEP maket is a honeypot; but it&#039;s a possibility.

				For me it loads normal. Guess it depends a bit on your route through the onion router and the exit point. (timout)<br /><br />But like i said, with all the SR buyers/vendors registering and setting up lists it must be like a ddos attack. I assume they will take care of the problem (last time it happened to SR, it took 5 days to solve the problem remember). Just to make it clear, i&#039;m not in any way connected to BMR and I haven&#039;t placed 1 order since I was only using SR. But they are clearly number 2 so it seems like a logical choice to continue business with them instead of a small unfinished project like sheep.<br /><br />Their forum should be online, i suggest we start complaining about loading issues ;)

				I&#039;m in agreement that &quot;sheep&quot; rubs me the wrong way entirely. But another thing to consider is that BMR has that automatic encryption shit, which is sketchy as all hell. I don&#039;t trust either of these sites one bit.

A bunch of vendors arriving with lists of items to list and loyal customers following them and ready to buy will probably overload the infrastructure and cause a backlog for a while.
