				Ok so here it go&#039;s...<br /><br />This little shit was busted for selling MDMA IRL that he was buying from SR He says in the interview that he wasn&#039;t busted by electronic crimes squad or anything like that. He feels that he must have been informed by neighbors due to high traffic volume at his house. He&#039;s totally go on camera and told the nation the in&#039;s and out&#039;s of how SR operates. He did also mention how safe that SR has made being able to purchase drugs as opposed to buying them on the street due to the information that&#039;s at hand on the products. What an asshole!! I can&#039;t believe this guy made mention of SR if he got busted via different means other than a CD. He didn&#039;t get busted by customs or the Feds. He had state police arrest him on information they received and he just spills his guts when they had no clue of his use of SR at all. What a fucking moron!! And now he&#039;s there more than likely getting paid for the interview totally lifting the lid on the whole thing!!<br /><br />This interview wasn&#039;t about dark net in general but instead it was about SR specifically. How many others saw this shit??

				Guys you need to calm down. The people that oppose the Silk Road (LE) already know everything about it. There is nothing wrong with telling half of Australia about it, if anything it will help the site grow.<br /><br />You are not some privileged bunch of people that this is exclusive to, this site is for everyone and anybody could&#039;ve found out that information for themselves.<br /><br />Honestly I am so sick of the whole &quot;keep silkroad a secret&quot; attitude. Yeah he&#039;s a dog for saying shit about it for money but he wasn&#039;t saying anything new or confidential.<br />

				Sorry man I&#039;m not the argumentative type but Sr doesn&#039;t need any kind of public relations and it&#039;s not a matter of &quot;keeping SR secret&quot; it&#039;s a matter of the security over-hauls that all this publicity is going to bring with it. It may not happen now but it will happen. My main concern resulting from this is not an increase in people using SR, I couldn&#039;t give a shit about that. What I do care about however is not just Customs but Australia Post completely over-hauling the way the identify and search suspect packages and pretty soon we won&#039;t even be able to depend on domestic packages making it.<br /><br />

				Would not the expansion of customers and vendors be welcomed ?&nbsp; More business ???&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this why Atlantis has risen???&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The dude totally screwed up snitching on himself, or maybe they were already on to him and just wanted him to do the &quot;walk of shame&quot; with the interview.&nbsp; What the broadcast did was solidify the fact that SR is pretty solid.&nbsp; (20/20 packages made it through!!!)&nbsp; Then they interview the vendor, which is really funny how the edited his voice. (squeeky chipmunk voice;&nbsp; &quot;business is good you&#039;know,)&nbsp; &nbsp;Now that guy was running a real risk.&nbsp; From my understanding, state side, reporters and their camera crews, and sometimes their sponsor can get in a lot of trouble if they don&#039;t reveal their C.I. for the interview, and can be charged with aiding and abiding.&nbsp; This has happened before, when reporters go into cities showing junkies shooting up, shoplifting, scoring or distributing on film, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				SR is not a secret...&nbsp; probably hasn&#039;t been since the beginning or near it.&nbsp; But unfortunately because of those who started and perpetuate the WOD, it certainly doesn&#039;t need any more publicity than it already has... publicity that it never would have had in the first place if it wasn&#039;t for people who for whatever reason seem to think that whatever they may or may not stand to gain by potentially screwing up the lives of one or more people that they probably don&#039;t even know.<br /><br />People need to mind their own business...<br /><br />There is no lower life form than a snitch or equivalent...

				More publicity will definitely lead to heightened surveillance simply because every time it&#039;s shown, it will stir up dissidents. The more dedicated dissidents one has, the more money they can allocate to the cause.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whoever DPR is, congrats, you got a bitch a PhD lol<br />

				Dudes, shut&nbsp; the fuck up any implied threats. I know we are all pissed that this guy was stupid, got busted and is now being rewarded for being such a poor excuse for a human being and spilling his guts about SR, but I doubt that he told LE anything they did not know. However, you can figure every reporter in Australia will be scanning these articles, and will quote the most sensational thing they can find.&nbsp; SR does not Kneecap anybody, that&#039;s what makes it different.&nbsp; and was probably the I don&#039;t think DPR&nbsp; The first time real violence is traced to SR,&nbsp; we will see real attacks on the site.<br /><br />I think big danger now is that kids that will be encouraged to enter our community,&nbsp; and I feel we should try to screen them out somehow.&nbsp; I know it can&#039;t be perfect,&nbsp; but perhaps we should try to screen prospects by requiring the knowledge in areas such as drug effects, dosage, security and PGP.&nbsp; One could argue that such knowledge is essential to safety at SR.&nbsp; I&#039;ll&nbsp; probably be flamed, but I really don&#039;t think kids &lt;18&nbsp; should do drugs,&nbsp; not that it will stop them.&nbsp; <br /><br />If we must get publicity,&nbsp; at least let&#039;s show the fallacy of the argument that Drugs == Violence.

				Hi SR´s!!<br /><br />Agree with some of the &quot;above´s&quot;, Sr doesn´t need ANY publicity!<br />The more ppl know about it, the more possible is it (for customs, etc) to get more financial power to fight against SR (&quot;we must close it to save our children&quot;).<br />If it is loud about our community, much more ppl get knowledge about it, and how many<br />&quot;wannabe - policeman&quot; are out there...<br /><br />I wouldn´t like if someone observes me checking the letterbox, only cause I´m looking a little &quot;hippielike&quot;!<br />Particularly if u use another ones letterbox!<br /><br />...so happy that I´m not living in Aus!!!

If I&#039;d done my PhD on SR, it would have been a quick PhD! Actually, they tend to take a little longer than 2 years. My PhD was about drugs and the internet more generally, and because I did the data collection in 2007-08, it was about online forums where drugs are discussed. My PhD goes into how forums assist with harm reduction and how communities are created online that can affect people&#039;s drug use and harms too.<br /><br />My take on the Today Tonight report - they asked me to contribute. I was going to decline, but figured they would go ahead with or without me, and it would probably be better with me. I spoke about the harm reduction aspects of SR community - e.g. reduced chance of violence when not having to associate directly with street markets to buy drugs. Of course the two quotes they chose weren&#039;t really that interesting to me... but that&#039;s how these things go.<br /><br />For those who aren&#039;t in Australia, Today Tonight is notoriously sensationalist. So I was actually a little surprised that they presented a mainly factual report - it could have been a lot worse.<br /><br />As for the debate in this thread and elsewhere across the forums about drawing attention to SR, from my discussions with LE at conferences and the like, I can assure you that Australia&#039;s federal police and customs are working very hard to combat SR. I don&#039;t think these reports will make any difference to those efforts or the funding they have access to. But I do think it&#039;s likely they will increase general awareness by potential new buyers and vendors in Australia. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178870.msg1294231#msg1294231">Quote from: astor on July 01, 2013, 09:34 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If your security depends on the indifference of your adversary, you&#039;re already screwed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This quote sums it up to me. I guess, though, in Australia, it is likely that we have a higher rate of detection of packages/letters at the border - BUT if more and more people in Australia order products (anything) from overseas, there will be more and more letters and parcels. The rate of detection is based on the total number of parcels coming in. So, in some ways, if these reports massively increase the number of importers, the chances of any one individual being detected (all other things like packaging and source country being equal) would decrease.<br /><br />Like all things, it&#039;s a balance between increased efforts/finances pushed into detection, versus the increasing size of the market, and therefore increased spread of the risk. <br /><br />Then there&#039;s just 3D printing, which will change everything once we can jailbreak our new 3D printer, download the template and create any drug we want. ;)

				I don&#039;t really hold a strong opinion on Ryan West. But I&#039;m not sure why everyone hates him so much. To me, he was an idiot, for sure - why would you intentionally be careless so police could catch you drug dealing? Seems pretty lame to me. But when you actually listen to what he says about SR, he doesn&#039;t blame SR for him being caught and basically says that if you follow the rules and are careful, you are unlikely to get caught. This seems a reasonable statement to make. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m missing something ;)

				Its bad for bitcoins legitimacy but it will likely give vendors more business which is good , they can choose to go stealth mode if it gets too much.<br /><br />Recently with the atlantis black market doing that clearnet advert + SR being in the news I think SR will be getting much more attention from customers and enemies of the road , possibly make it harder to buy bitcoins?<br /><br /><br />I think it will create a boom period for silkroad and help boost the postal system so postal workers don&#039; get fired!

If I&#039;d done my PhD on SR, it would have been a quick PhD! Actually, they tend to take a little longer than 2 years. My PhD was about drugs and the internet more generally, and because I did the data collection in 2007-08, it was about online forums where drugs are discussed. My PhD goes into how forums assist with harm reduction and how communities are created online that can affect people&#039;s drug use and harms too.<br /><br />My take on the Today Tonight report - they asked me to contribute. I was going to decline, but figured they would go ahead with or without me, and it would probably be better with me. I spoke about the harm reduction aspects of SR community - e.g. reduced chance of violence when not having to associate directly with street markets to buy drugs. Of course the two quotes they chose weren&#039;t really that interesting to me... but that&#039;s how these things go.<br /><br />For those who aren&#039;t in Australia, Today Tonight is notoriously sensationalist. So I was actually a little surprised that they presented a mainly factual report - it could have been a lot worse.<br /><br />As for the debate in this thread and elsewhere across the forums about drawing attention to SR, from my discussions with LE at conferences and the like, I can assure you that Australia&#039;s federal police and customs are working very hard to combat SR. I don&#039;t think these reports will make any difference to those efforts or the funding they have access to. But I do think it&#039;s likely they will increase general awareness by potential new buyers and vendors in Australia. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178870.msg1294231#msg1294231">Quote from: astor on July 01, 2013, 09:34 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If your security depends on the indifference of your adversary, you&#039;re already screwed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This quote sums it up to me. I guess, though, in Australia, it is likely that we have a higher rate of detection of packages/letters at the border - BUT if more and more people in Australia order products (anything) from overseas, there will be more and more letters and parcels. The rate of detection is based on the total number of parcels coming in. So, in some ways, if these reports massively increase the number of importers, the chances of any one individual being detected (all other things like packaging and source country being equal) would decrease.<br /><br />Like all things, it&#039;s a balance between increased efforts/finances pushed into detection, versus the increasing size of the market, and therefore increased spread of the risk. <br /><br />Then there&#039;s just 3D printing, which will change everything once we can jailbreak our new 3D printer, download the template and create any drug we want. ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can thank me for that amazing entrance :)<br /><br /><br />No less, I would imagine that with a PhD thesis based in such a specialized field, it would be highly underutilized until a market as popular and thriving as Silk Road were to show up.&nbsp; So to that effect, it did kind &quot;get you your PhD,&quot; perhaps solely in a more known way. I&#039;m sure it makes your research far more relevant.<br /><br />I&#039;m somewhat leery of the journalists and researches that claim to be here. While I can totally imagine impartiality and, well, generally not knowing who the fuck we are anyway, what real positive can you have on being here and mining?&nbsp; The only claim is that your PhDship (openly) has more credit than us drug users, which is correct. But who is the real benefactor: these markets or your research&#039;s relevance?

To be fair, for bushy shit and the fact it didn&#039;t smoke that great, it wasn&#039;t tooo bad when it got you stoned.<br /><br />I would like to say first of all that at these times, his weed was a respectable price, around $250 an ounce as it should be.<br /><br />So next order, it wasn&#039;t too bad but very very average and by no means medical grade and more like chemically laced and cerebral induced stone but after using a Breville Coffee &amp; Spice grinder to fluff it out managed to get something respectable out of.<br /><br />The next few times were just this ridiculously horrid, stemmy, wet and worthless super vac sealed weed.<br /><br />The final time was inside a DVD case since I&#039;m assuming yours was slightly better than what I ordered off 1StopOz for curiosity since he had decent prices and good looking buds that were beyond terrible... way way way beyond terrible and unlike HB it came the next day and his was a week later so I assume I&#039;m correct.<br /><br />It was this really bright green harsh as fuck, spindly barely mature crap and was evidently horseshit because I stopped buying off you after that or anyone on Silk Road because there&#039;s nobody on here selling anything decent and compared to the rest of the world we are a fucking embarrassment.<br /><br />I seriously considered buying 15lbs and going to town and destroying your &quot;business&quot; and every other cunt on here&#039;s poor excuse for weed and prices and show people what really constitutes good weed at respectable prices and I just may. <br /><br />So keep pushing my buttons sunshine and find yourself out of business through supply an demand and when I flood the market with good cheap dope what the fuck are you going to do then when you&#039;re probably just some shit cunt buying 4 oz&#039;s at a time for around $1150, getting scammed yourself, then turning around and doing the same thing to others and thinking your big time when in fact I laugh at you and those like you... fucking popcorn gangsters!<br /><br />Is that the reply you expected, if you had have contacted me I may have been much more cordial but like I said, clearly the truth hurts!<br /><br />Have a nice weekend, or what&#039;s left of it won&#039;t you?<br /><br />Oh and one more thing, naming yourself after a mediocre movie that the star of the movie was ashamed to make and is aimed at 16yr old&#039;s shows much more about your personality and age than you realise but then again, half baked is all you&#039;ll get off your weed because fell baked you need some filthy stinky dank nuggets like I have here instead.<br /><br />Enjoy your shitty existence and anyone buying shit off you needs a brain transplant!<br /><br />- JWM<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />lol..
