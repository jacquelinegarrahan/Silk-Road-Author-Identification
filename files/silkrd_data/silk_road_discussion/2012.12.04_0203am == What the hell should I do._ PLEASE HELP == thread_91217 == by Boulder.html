				So I don&#039;t want to go into too many details yet, but I received an order today from a vendor, and the product was not as advertised in fact I don&#039;t even think it was &quot;low quality&quot; or anything I think it wasn&#039;t a drug period, and a fucking beverage.&nbsp; <br /><br />What do I do? Should I finalize still? Should I wait, and click resolve? The vendor hasn&#039;t responded yet, it&#039;s only been a few hours though. I messaged SR Support on SR too. I want a FULL REFUND as I&#039;m very disappointed. Not only that, but this messed up a lot of things.&nbsp; Shitty time for a first/second purchase on SilkRoad............<br /><br />Please help thanks everyone.

				Why can&#039;t you provide details? If you have been scammed then there is no reason to hide the facts to make everyone else more aware.<br /><br />That being said, we can&#039;t really help you until we know what happened.

				Okay. I placed an order with DB4DH for a gram of Heroin I had waited a while, and canceled, but then he started talking to me so I placed another order with him as long as he would communicate more I said which he started to just so I could know I was getting my order out. <br /><br />I placed a custom order for a gram he gave a gram and a half. I see why now.....I got tracking it was the wrong one. he gave the right one today after it arrived saying sorry we just noticed we gave teh wrong one. I was nice though and said thank you. I worked with them and was content the whole time. <br /><br />It smelled like coffee. It burned when snorted so bad you&#039;d tear up you could tell it wasn&#039;t dope. You could see it in the water when disolved. On their page it says &quot;refined in turkey lab&quot; or something like that.....more like cut to shit with coffee if even cut and not just coffee in a turkey lab........... :(&nbsp; I want a refund I&#039;m really not happy about this. I spent a total of 9.73 BTC&#039;s <br /><br />I know it&#039;s not THAT much but it&#039;s still money I could have used to buy REAL heroin, and get my money back. Not to mention a first transaction on Silk Road....

Product is Afghanistan heroin, refined in a Turkish lab. Very strong.<br /><br />If you are an old customer, please be advised that this is a new supply (as of Nov 29th) and much more potent than any of our previous product offerings for heroin #4.<br /><br />Payment accepted exclusively through escrow - do not finalize to release your funds until you receive the product.<br /><br />Delivery is guaranteed or your money back! <br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s just crappy heroin man.. it&#039;s nothing like heroin at all. I&#039;ve test plenty of heroin before, and this is not heroin if it is, it&#039;s cut like I mentioned, and that&#039;s like 90% coffee 10% if that dope.

				This is fucking ridiculous. No I didn&#039;t finalize, I don;t plan on it now. I should wait, and hit resolve right? <br /><br /><br />I thought something was up when he said he wanted me to finalize after he gave me tracking, which I agreed I would since he was going to do a little extra.<br /><br />&nbsp;Then he says I don&#039;t need to the next day when he gives me tracking.

				I&#039;ve never done H but have been following listings for months with my eye on some that is good quality that can be snorted and that seems super scarce or even non existent.&nbsp; I stopped following db4dh listings long ago after seeing numerous reviews that his H is shit.&nbsp; $100 for a gram would throw up a flag right there, nobody else&#039;s prices are even close to that.&nbsp; If I would have got that in the mail and thrown it on the scale and seen 1.5g I would have been sad right off the bat because there is no way someone would come on SR and charge a small fraction of the dope price for something that was actually dope.&nbsp; Sorry for your loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(

				DeathB4DisHonor finally messaged me back.....Although I can&#039;t believe he is still claiming this..It kind of disgusts me that he is.....BUT he replied with this.........<br /><br />Hello friend,<br />We understand that you are not satisfied with your order. The product itself is very strong quality heroin. However, we did put the material in our coffee grinder to remove the hardened rocks. There is no cut, just a few stray coffee grounds.&nbsp; Even if we wanted to cut our product, we would never use a material that could not dissolve, like coffee grounds. Obviously that would make no sense whatsoever.<br />Clearly if we had anticipated this result we would not have pureed our product in this manner. We would be happy to send you a replacement order of our on hand stock if you are willing hold your rating at 5/5 as per your contract.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience and consideration in this matter!<br /><br />All the best,<br />Raj <br /><br /><br />I replied with this........To better help support my claim, and show you it&#039;s NOT heroin like you claim, I just tested like I said again, and it all clumped up in my nose I took it out of my nose, and it&#039;s not heroin man, I put it in water, and drank it. It taste like coffee...<br /><br />Well because it IS coffee my friend. If you claim you ran it through the coffee grinder it left behind 90% of your heroin and only coffee came out, because I&#039;m 150% it&#039;s coffee without a doubt now, and am not happy at all, and am getting more unhappy with the lack of communication at the moment especially since I just got shafted with coffee instead, and you&#039;re still claiming it&#039;s high quality heroin. <br /><br />When I just decided to give benefit of the doubt AGAIN thinking maybe it was something I did wrong, but no I now know I&#039;m not doing anything wrong, and you sent me fucking coffee. (Sorry for my language not trying to use profanity, but this is not something a vendor should do, not to mention that we discussed future orders, etc for a while before I placed my order/during my order.)&nbsp; <br /><br />My man I&#039;ve been very calm, and courteous with you throughout my whole order even when mistakes were made, and other things were wrong. <br />I would think the least you could do would be to fully refund me for false advertisement of your item. <br /><br />I respectfully would have to decline your offer of a reshipment of &quot;product on hand&quot; that you have offered because it is the same as what you have just sent me am I right? So why would I want to get sent another 1.5 grams of coffee.? In a sense I&#039;d be stuck in the same position I am now, and would have to go through all these unnecessary transactions, and back and forth messages which I have to wait a day or so for you to answer, and so on.

				Wow I don;t need you few childish members in here, I&#039;m not trying to scam him at all, I&#039;m not try to intentionally get my money back, I&#039;d rather have money back then get coffee again it seriously is I even made REGULAR coffee with what he sent me and it was like drinking coffee you buy at a store. I&#039;m not stupid.&nbsp; Of course I wouldn&#039;t want a reship if he offers the same product as a reship because it&#039;d be pointless we would be ending up right back at the same spot. <br /><br />And look at his reviews alot of them like the poster above complain about it smelling &quot;sweet&quot; and potency. Well I went forward because he claimed it was A LOT stronger than the reviews that he had because it was new...well it may be new, but the last batch had to have been better if people actually got effects from it I can&#039;t get any effect period from various methods of administration.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how many times I must repeat myself I sound like a broken record explaining to you guys that obviously can&#039;t read. This is coffee I know what coffee is, and this is it. I&#039;m not tarnishing his reputation with childish bantering I&#039;m trying to resolve the situation stop being so anal.&nbsp; And obviously you didn&#039;t read my post if you did you would have saw that he did say he ran it through the COFFEE GRINDER well it must have left behind all the dope, OR he cut it, because I can see the coffee if I dissolve it or if it&#039;s snorted it clumps, or if you taste it it taste JUST like coffee powder I have in my house. Did you NOT see my statement about how I made a fucking cup of actually coffee with what he sent me ? how the heck is that possible if it was heroin in the bags? It&#039;s not because Heroin doesn&#039;t decompose, or whatever have you into Coffee. <br /><br />Don&#039;t bother commenting in the thread if you&#039;re going to be ignorant. <br /><br />

				Boulder- get your $ back and move to the next and more HONEST and REPUTABLE vendor.&nbsp; DB4D has been pulling these &quot;I will give you what you originally purchased because I tried to scam you and you didn&#039;t fall for it as long as you leave the feedback 5/5&quot; scams for as long as I have been a member here. The guy already admitted it was coffee and if he isn&#039;t checking each order 100X before he sends it out, he never will because it seems his orders are and have been mostly bunk.

				I would if he would actually take the damn time to sit down, and work this out with me instead of one fucking message every other day or so. <br /><br />And yes Aurelius Venport he does what a surprise it would have been if you would have took the time to actually read about this, and check on the vendor before calling me out without any knowledge of the incident. Second it doesn&#039;t matter nor does this have ANYTHING to do with you or what YOU would do, so why even bring that up. Just because YOU wouldn&#039;t cut someones dope doesn&#039;t mean that other people automatically won&#039;t now. Or that I&#039;m trying to scam the vendor. lol. <br /><br />It depends what a point is to you but yes generally it&#039;s $20 if you cant find people I can get grams for $100 around here it just isn&#039;t the greatest or as good as the gear I could get for $150 a gram so don&#039;t try to pull another thing where just because your buddy can&#039;t get grams cheaper than $20 a point that it is impossible.

				Never ever EVER order from DB4D!!<br /><br />Dope is AWFUL. Customer service is AWFUL. Took him almost a month to send me like 200mg of SHIT because my order &quot;got lost in his mess of orders&quot; or something. If you look on these forums you&#039;ll find he is FAR from a reputable member. $100 a gram on the road is very very cheap but hell you&#039;re paying for quality, consistency and stealthy fuckin&#039; packaging so obviously shit&#039;s gonna be more expensive.<br /><br />Do more research on the forums to find better vendors and always look them up on here before placing an order.<br /><br />Good luck, man!<br /><br />

				A little late for that Noddingoff lol where were you when I needed you eh ? <br /><br />Customer service was actually good for me UNTIL now, he&#039;s lacking communication and not responding if he does which he only did that once the other day he responded a day or more later. <br />That&#039;s NOT right especially when he KNOWS what happened now. <br /><br />It&#039;s not even awful heroin it&#039;s not even heroin Noddingoff , it&#039;s coffee legitimate coffee I even made a cup of coffee by adding water, etc to it if you had read earlier posts. <br />How the hells that possible DB4DH if what I got was Heroin?&nbsp; He even admitted he &quot;ran&quot; it through the coffee grinder, and there were chunks of coffee in it himself. Now that was NOT advertised in your listing that it&#039;s VERY STRONG PURE heroin...but I forgot to leave out im going to run it through my coffee grinder and let chunks of coffee get into it because that&#039;s not important at all. <br /><br />I did do research I said earlier in this thread a few times I just gave him a benefit of the doubt because he said he had new product. I have 2 people that I&#039;ll only buy from now unless others could prove they are good i dont know if that would be possible though cause I&#039;m more than likely not giving anyone else a chance besides who I worked with so far Prejator (New vendor by the&nbsp; way who is the best to work with) And Subsandaddy I haven&#039;t even done business with him yet, but he has me as a customer for sure. <br /><br />

				Even though I&#039;ve claimed it&#039;s coffee because I made a cup of coffee with it, I&#039;ve decided to test the product again thinking maybe it was the first two bags only so I took the last bag to test. <br /><br />I just snorted a whole half of a gram (the full bag) and NOTHING not one slight effect at all.Just a lot of burn, and drip that taste like coffee, and that&#039;s all I can smell now. <br /><br />Yes it was a dumb idea, I know, I just wanted to prove DB4DH was LYING about his product, and really should not be aloud to be a vendor here on the SR unless they can get their shit together, and get real product.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />To the above person. <br /><br />*Am I new here?* Hard question to answer, but the easy answer is- Yes. <br /><br />*My first order?* Pretty much it was my first, but canceled then replaced after I made, and received two other orders, so technically my third order.

				@ThePhoenix<br /><br />I think it sucks that even known good vendors have the upper hand on newbies.&nbsp; They can use their good ratings to rip off a newbie and then just blame the new buyer as being a scammer.&nbsp; I really wish there was a way around that.<br /><br />I asked a very reputable dealer recently if they can sell a different amount of a certain product they have advertised.&nbsp; The response was for me to send the BTC and a little extra for shipping.&nbsp; No escrow or anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then when nothing showed and I complained I would be marked the liar scammer.&nbsp; <br /><br />So it seems that newbies, although they are even more money for the sellers, have to take extra care in how they work on SR.&nbsp; I could be marked a scammer before I even have a few buys under my belt.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />good luck!

				Why is it as soon as a buyer has a problem some people assume they are scamming, a 92 rating isn&#039;t exactly a ringing endorsement. To be fair this buyer started off not wanting to share too many details and only did when pressed for info, doesn&#039;t sound like a scammer to me. It could be entirely possible the vendor fucked up, they admitted to grinding the product in a coffee grinder AFTER the buyer said it smelled/looked like coffee not before, quite a coincidence wouldn&#039;t you say??<br /><br />Take it to resolution and state your claim and let SR decide.

				Can I throw in my 2 hundredths of a bitcoin here? I don&#039;t a whole lot about DB4D other than he is an obvious fan of 5FDP band. I&#039;ve followed his listings since I joined and have chosen other vendors mainly because I don&#039;t even remember HOW to snort dope. It all goes in my arm. Base H is not great for IV less you wanna put citric acid in it which is excellent for your veins. However his success level suggests that he isn&#039;t a direct scammer.\<br /><br />Now I will avoid actually giving advise on this and give &quot;what i would do.&quot;<br /><br />I would consider accepting DB4D&#039;s offer of reship. SR may very well try to push this idea also, I have no idea. Reason for my thoughts: Many vendors from whom I&#039;ve done business with, and others who&#039;ve I&#039;ve been watching, seem to have Employees. Big vendors aren&#039;t just one guy doing these things. Perhaps one of his drop-shippers is the one who swapped your shit with coffee. It makes a lot of sense. The person could have been in WD and really needing the H. He/she would NOT have bothered to weigh the coffee which explains the overweight. This scenario I&#039;ve imagined is very Dope-fiend-like behavior. Perhaps DB4D wants to rectify the situation.<br /><br />Regardless of the route you choose, You&#039;re in for a long ride. SR Resolution will take time. Accepting the reship will take time. Your Bitcoins are gone for a couple months minimum. Go buy some more and get the drugs you want, and be patient about your resolution.

				No he doesn&#039;t want to fix anything he scammed me straight up. He wont respond to ANY messages now he did respond once more after I said I&#039;d accept his reship he said hes sorry he couldnt because he already shipped out what he had on hand and I may think hes being unreasonable but it always seems like the customers are unsatisfied and he does nothing wrong is pretty much what the message said and thanks for being patient and to message if I needed anything.............THAT JUST AVOIDED THE WHOLE SITUATUION he needs to man up stop being a fucking dick and just admit he fucked up. I even messaged and said I&#039;m so fed up that I&#039;d be content with even half of my money $60 of it just to end this and give me some money so I wasn&#039;t stuck without any product..and I got the message that I mentioned above. No he scammed me No it has to be intentionally why else would someone act like this, and send me coffee.<br /><br />/Rant

				I&#039;m new here and have only made a couple of purchases so far.&nbsp; Whenever I make a non-trivial purchase for anything, I always do a lot of research to make sure I&#039;m getting a good deal.&nbsp; Here, I usually search the forums for the vendor name and see what comes up.&nbsp; As with anything on the internet, you can&#039;t believe everything you read and sometimes I have a hard time discerning truth from bullshit.&nbsp; I was considering DB4d&#039;s gear initially, but decided against it after reading in the rumor mill of unknown substances showing up.&nbsp; That is the one thing that scares me the most about this game, is for a seller-fiend to throw some random crap they find around the house that looks like dope into a bag, and then somebody slams a big dose and ends up dead or worse.<br /><br />In light of the OP&#039;s experience, I have a few questions from the perspective of a buyer wanting to avoid scams:<br /><br />How reliable is seller feedback, and can it be manipulated? Is there any way to tell if this is occurring?<br />How pervasive is sock puppeting by both sellers and their competitors on the forums?<br />How common is it for buyers to scam sellers by claiming not as advertised, etc.?<br /><br />I know the SR staff that has to sort these disputes out, they must have some kind of system to resolve claims.&nbsp; I would imagine as this place grows, it must be hard to keep up with the dispute resolution since these can obviously be complicated to sort through.<br /><br />One thing I have noticed is that the practice of FE has become so pervasive that it is making it much easier for scammers, and tilts the advantage heavily toward the sellers.&nbsp; It has become so pervasive that the selection of non-FE policy is limited and eager buyers are willing to do it, and leaving feedback at the same time.&nbsp; I can understand FE for spanking new buyers with little feedback, and the frustration of honest sellers having do deal with BS or having to wait for their coins, but this practice still opens the door wide open for seller scams.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
