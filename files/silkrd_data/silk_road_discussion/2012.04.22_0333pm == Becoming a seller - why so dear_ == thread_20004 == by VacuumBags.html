				I think it&#039;s mostly to prevent scammers. When you know a vendor has paid $150 or whatever it costs, you at least have some faith in their integrity. If anyone could create an account for a low cost the number of scams would go way up. And of course it&#039;s a way for the great creators of this site to get some profit$$$$$.

				As stated, 150$ is a lot more than most are willing to pay for the chance of a scam being successful.<br /><br />Also, keeping this site up isn&#039;t free, and hey, look at all the people winning prizes and shit for 4/20. How much more awesome can it get?<br />

				As someone else said the last time this was brought up, if you can&#039;t afford $150, you can&#039;t be a good seller. <br /><br />Depending on your product, you need at least $1000+ to be a good seller...<br /><br />You have to pay for the vendor&#039;s acct, pay to stock up your product, pay for a labeler, pay for packaging supplies, pay for shipping costs, pay for computer security devices (encrypted disk, vpn, etc...), and after all that, once people order from you, you have to wait 3-10 days for them to finalize while your money is tied up in escrow, and then be able to supply more product for new orders.

				I think the current price of 28 something BTC is just right.<br /><br />Scammers are usually little kids in the parents home and few will be able to afford the 28BTC. <br /><br />Drugs attract scammers like flies around crap but many of the scammers are just junkies angling for more drugs and so they will be unlikely to have 28BTC to spare.<br /><br />There will always be scammers who sell good gear for a while and hit and run on some &#039;big deals&#039; for &#039;loyal customers&#039;. I just buy for my own use so am unlikely to be attracted by big deals. However there are traders who I would consider getting a nice piece of hash off. Weed I don&#039;t need. Hash is rare here so its good to be able to buy without stuffing it down my balls and praying there is no sniffer dog at the airport&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I wanted to buy a seller account with my winnings here but for security I will buy it under another name with bitcoin.

				Yea no doubt. It takes a lot more than $150 bucks I can tell. I wouldn&#039;t want to be a seller with the intentions of getting people to finalize early so I could run down the road and buy the product they have already paid for then ship it. I&#039;d want to stock up on products that have been put to the test and are for sure genuine so $150 bucks is just the icing on the cake. You would also need packaging equipment like a vacuum sealer and you would need to have different ways of stealth packaging because you don&#039;t want to be sending out the same kind of packages 1000 times a month. I can&#039;t wait to get started as a vendor but you can be dam sure it&#039;s going to be done right with no FE bullshit

				$150 (£90 to me) which is essentially small change compared to being able to turn over $1000s of dollars a day.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t do the economics of that then you are either a cheapskate or you aren&#039;t really serious about what ya doing.<br /><br />You gotta spend money to make money and given that you can be ballin by using SR and these forums $150 is pennies. I&#039;ve done over £5000 out of giving financial consultations ALONE and I&#039;ve been here just over 2 months. <br /><br />Come on OP....really?

				I have been researching what it takes to set up a vendor account. I don&#039;t have an issue with the $150 but I am left wondering <br /><br />It is a one time charge or a monthly charge?<br />Are there other fees attached such as a % of sale or transfer fees?<br /><br />I just can not seem to find a good reference about what it takes to be a vendor what the fee&#039;s are and any other requirements (Other than the standard security.)<br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s definitely a fair price and I think if it were a little more, it would still be fair.&nbsp; Some of the profits some of these vendors procure is mind boggling.&nbsp; I guess you have to take into account the commission as well, but it seems fair compared to other online marketplaces.

				I assume you mean &quot;prescription medication&quot;?<br /><br />In the quoted post that you stated as bullshit, I can see the words &quot;depending on your product&quot;, which I think covers the fact that not all products require expensive sealing methods.&nbsp; Most of the other stuff still applies though.

				I cut the vending account money out of my weed money for a month (well twice cause the first time I got BTC suckered lol). <br /><br />I spent a few months on the forum talking up my mushies and chillaxin&#039; with the peeps here.. being a good fellow.<br /><br />I throw up harvest pictures and put a profile blurb up (don&#039;t even have listings yet for god&#039;s sake) and I&#039;ve got&nbsp; inquiries about bulk!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t even have live listings YET! This is just the forum crowd chatting me up.<br /><br />I can hardly imagine what will happen when I go live. If you have a love of your product, and are serious about moving it and feeding the people.. the $150 is nothing, nada, zilch.<br /><br />It&#039;s not dear.. it&#039;s cheap as fuck.

				The fee is definitely more than fair!! That is the minimum investment!! To do this properly it takes A-LOT of work and money to get started. after fees, vacuum sealer, and samples Im in over a couple thousand easy!! Also with all the exposure the road has been getting it would not bother me to see the fee go up. that just means better sellers, less scammers, and more people with buyer accounts and not seller accounts!! This is my full time job. I run it like a business and I plan to be here to stay!! 150.00 is nothing for a drug dealing storefront. That my buddies is GOLD. :) Much luv. Dr.G

				Yeah, its not fun to shell out 30 BTC (about $150) to become a seller. But I just did it. And I do see why its necessary. First off, running a site like this isn&#039;t free. It takes money to make money, so charging for a seller&#039;s account is fair. And honestly, if you can&#039;t afford the $150 up front, you&#039;re not going to become a very successful seller on here. Most importantly, if it was free to become a seller, or cost a nominal fee (&lt;$100 or so), scammers would flock trying to a buck off you, never to be seen again (see Topix). So, as a [new] seller, I believe it is fair and right to charge the amount it cost to upgrade to a seller&#039;s account. I just thank SR mods for the opportunity.<br /><br />-DC

				I&#039;m going to agree with the above who have also stated that paying the vendor fee account shouldn&#039;t be as big of a deal as one would think. (Hello, run-on sentence) I&#039;ve been doing some thinking lately, about setting one up. And I know I have the cash, however just because you have the money to front doesn&#039;t mean you can do this. Personally, I&#039;m not ready yet. I&#039;ve been lurking for quite some time, made a handful of purchases but I mean to go into this it just isn&#039;t about money. It&#039;s a job. Around the clock every day.
