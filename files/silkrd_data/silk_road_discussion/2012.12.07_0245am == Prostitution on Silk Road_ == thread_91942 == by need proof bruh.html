				Any of you degens ever think about prostitution on SR, could be ideal for some people, wifey can&#039;t trace the bitcoin :)<br />It would only be good for major cities in america and uk/europe I would guess, not enough business elsewhere. Still a pimp in New York or London could make some decent money through sr I think. I just hope for the clients sake that he does not &#039;finalize early&#039;, you wanna get your money&#039;s worth!

				It would be very unwise of the Silk Road to allow a service that hurts people. I know that some women choose prostitution, but many more are forced into sex slavery, and I&#039;d rather not take the risk that this latter group be something that Silk Road has to offer. This is why I support the legalization of prostitution: we will leave behind all the shady mob-run angles, and make sure that sex workers are treated properly. But until that day, think twice about buying a prostitute. You never know who you&#039;re hurting.

				As an Australian who&#039;s country legalized hookers years ago because it regulated and controlled the industry, it baffles me why people can&#039;t see the dichotomy between this and the drug laws.<br /><br />It is my hope that with the end of the drug war, Silk Road will become a major international business that&#039;s free to operate alongside Amazon and eBay with the same legal protection these companies are afforded through fairness and common decency of open trade.<br /><br />Till then, unless you&#039;re in a place it&#039;s legal or you have a Heidie Fleiss madam to hook you up and the bank account to match it, I would stick to jacking off to porn if you&#039;re too stupid or ugly to get a woman.

				In the UK this is all on clearnet. Just go to punternet.com for reviews of girls in your area, then click through to one of the escorts&#039; sites for pictures and prices.

				Just use paper bag for you. That way you don&#039;t have to see her. You won&#039;t be seen, and you could buy recycle bags and recycle them. Kinks worked out. I&#039;ll send you an invoice after you&#039;ve made millions, or you could just send me 2 asian hookers. Either or. Lmfao. :-D
