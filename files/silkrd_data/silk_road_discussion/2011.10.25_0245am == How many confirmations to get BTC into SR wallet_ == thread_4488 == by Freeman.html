				So I sent my BTC to my SR wallet over 5 hours ago and I even donate the 0.01BTC for speedier transactions...currently have 24 confirmations but no money in the wallet. :(

				It takes 6 confirmations before the transaction is confirmed.&nbsp; There is something else going wrong here.&nbsp;

				45 confirmations and still nothing...I double checked the address on my account page and the address I sent the BTC to and they match.&nbsp; I messaged SilkRoad but they haven&#039;t gotten back to me yet. :-(

				It is one of the many &#039;bottlenecks&#039; in internet transfer of btc.&nbsp; Usually a few hrs, but I&#039;ve had it take as long as 24, so probably, that&#039;s all it is.&nbsp; Having said that, I find SR extremely good about taking care of btc problems.&nbsp; If you sent them, and didn&#039;t get them, they&#039;ll usually make it good.&nbsp; Again, it&#039;s a tough area, as I usually need them there *now* on some vendors, so I try to get some in there early, but when btc are headed south, I don&#039;t like to...best wishes to you, can be nervewracking, I know...

				SR mixes the coins and it takes longer.&nbsp; It is not just a simple transfer and it is to protect buyers and sellers.

				I know this is an old topic, but I&#039;m having the same issue. 12 confirmations and still nothing. I&#039;m sure it will eventually get here, but as was mentioned earlier, I would like to get an order in now lol!
