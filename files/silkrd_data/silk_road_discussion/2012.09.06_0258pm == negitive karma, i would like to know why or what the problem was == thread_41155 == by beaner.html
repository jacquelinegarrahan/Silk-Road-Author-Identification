				Karma&#039;s about as significant as the amount of glitterized cursewords on your myspace page, so far as I can see. <br />A decent part of the time, negs seem to be given for honesty =p.<br />I don&#039;t know that anyone really considers it as part of someone&#039;s reputation, unless it&#039;s to some ridiculous level where you must have been a scammer or started posting sex tapes of hitler.<br />Actually, I&#039;d probably one-up you for posting sex tapes of hitler.<br />Not that I hate jews or anything. It would just be interesting.<br />But I digress...

This is an anonymous underground drug forum based around agorist principles, with items of actual importance to discuss and debate.<br />Why do you honestly give a flying fuck about the karma system?!&nbsp; ???

				So the summation of this thread is:<br /><br />Best way to get karma: Neg m√ºslix <br /><br />Best way to get neg&#039;d: post a thread complaining about how you were neg&#039;d<br /><br />also acceptable way of getting karma: posting funny pictures of cats (this is Reddit right???)

				Cunts are the problem.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Just think of negs as a list of sad little no-life cunts who have frail egos and can&#039;t handle new people, new ideas, or sycophantic cock sucking dweebs being told inconvenient truths.<br /><br />Turning negs into pozez is just one of the services I offer.&nbsp; 8)
