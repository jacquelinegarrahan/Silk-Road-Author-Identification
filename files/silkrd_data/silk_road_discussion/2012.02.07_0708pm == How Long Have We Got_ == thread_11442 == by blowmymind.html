				All good things must come to and end right?! Silkroad is quite simply amazing, i cant believe it works so easily and freely its a revelation, but how long can it last? <br /><br />How long before the Authorities shut it down? <br /><br />God forbid it ever happens, im just curious how its been able to function for so long especially with the rise of members, youtube vids and articles all blowing the whistle.<br /><br />

				Tor&#039;s anonymity makes it difficult to find.<br /><br />Even if it were to be brought down, I have little doubt that multiple replacements would be up quickly, and one of them would become the most popular, again.

				If silk road goes down it will come right back up. If god forbid something happens to DPR hopefully he will pass on the reigns to someone who will keep this baby afloat. This little project here is bigger than any one of us and it will take more than an alphabet soup of agencies to take it down

				Yea I recently started using SR and the whole concept of it really intrigues me. It&#039;s like a secret community of that runs completely independent of any gov&#039;t laws and regulation; a completely free economy and self-governing community. I really hope SR is here to stay for awhile and that the owner and all members for that matter remain safe. TOR is pretty legit but you know the feds from around the world are busting their balls trying to figure it out...

				The idea of Silk Road is immortal. They might be able to take down individual sites but this revolution is unstoppable.

				So inspiring, so liberating, I almost dont want it to get any more popular or recognised! I feel like im in on something. Yenno? Thats incredibly selfish i know, but its just great to be a part of something like this. A revolution!
