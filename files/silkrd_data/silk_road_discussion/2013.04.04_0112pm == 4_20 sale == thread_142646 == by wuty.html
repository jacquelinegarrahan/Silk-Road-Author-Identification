My advice? Don&#039;t wait. Especially if you have been sitting on some coins for a long time now and are reaping what you sewed so to speak with the nice increase.&nbsp; :) <br />Coming back to 1 coin that was 2 months ago 10 dollars and now being 120...<br /><br />That was an especially nice 4/20 gift for me!<br /><br />Plus, you can always buy more! Support the vendors always, they do a great thing for us and waiting for them to go on sale is like waiting to go shopping only on black Friday. You still will need the product!<br /><br />Plus, your gonna have to wait longer for arrival as most of them will be swamped.<br /><br />That being said, also don&#039;t hesitate to order ON 4/20!<br /><br />I know, I&#039;m a little bit paradoxical. <br /><br />3,4

				ahh last year was amazing, i won 10 btc that was worth about Â£60 then i think haha imagine if that was now! we never did hear about the guy who won the holiday... i got loads of free shit from vendors though , it was awesome. i&#039;m not counting on it happening this year, the site is so slow with heavy traffic already i think a sale would have it go down haha. plus the whole tony76 fiasco might have tainted the idea of it.. would be sick though

				Hi guys! <br /><br />I tried to organize one this year and get some hype.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is a thread made somewhere with some notes and discussions.&nbsp; Search for 420 2013.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />There wasn&#039;t a lot of support and most said to leave it up to SR staff to organize it.&nbsp; I suggested they were too busy with scams and tech support to organize fun events like this.&nbsp; They need a communications person or just leave it to the community to organize itself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Many kept saying &quot;tony76&quot;. Over and over.&nbsp; &nbsp;Loser.&nbsp; Anyway, we have escrow now and will promote it as part of the 420 event as the slogan hehe.&nbsp; No FE<br /><br />I suggested we should form a committee and start with sending of notices and thread creation.&nbsp; Then hit up vendors for prizes and giveaways in exchange for sponsorship and mention of their name frequently in posts.&nbsp; <br /><br />It should pay for itself through sponsorship of vendors paying for the prizes and such.&nbsp; <br /><br />Contests!&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone has to form the contests and rules and such.&nbsp; <br /><br />The committee should be divided into groups and each take on a task.&nbsp; Meet up in the thread twice a week to see where everyone is at with their tasks .&nbsp; <br /><br />Ideas?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to see it happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to enter my weed and concentrates.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We need organizers and people to make it happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m here daily and can commit to some tasks.&nbsp; <br /><br />Suggestions?

				welllll you could try getting some big vendors involved then get them to spread the word a bit, the customers can&#039;t make the sale happen really. that&#039;s if there&#039;s nothing official going on. they usually keep sales pretty quiet on the lead up so yeah. some vendors will be interested in doing sales for 4/20 anyway and i&#039;m sure some have plans in place already.

				If vendors/SR itself hasn&#039;t sold all their BTC, or even if they did, they should be VERY rich.<br />For a community like this, I think that indulging a bit more in another &quot;prize giveaway&quot; thingy would be nice.<br />Keep prizes low, of course. $10-50 prizes like last time, with a few bigger ones. I think the best part was that prizes were so COMMON.<br />Nearly anyone who bought 3+ products had a very good chance of winning, which&nbsp; I really liked. It made it feel like SR actually had the money to make the whole place feel very &quot;inclusive&quot;, rather than like a wal-mart or ebay.<br />Anyways, just my opinion. Two 420 sales + prizes in a row would REALLY make people like SR though, I think. It&#039;d show that SR isn&#039;t just a one trick pony, but has the funds and power to do that twice, which is very impressive.
