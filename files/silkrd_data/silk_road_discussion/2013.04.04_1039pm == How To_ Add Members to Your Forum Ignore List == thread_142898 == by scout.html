				This will help guide you through the process of adding a member and their posts to your Ignore List on the forums.<br /><br /><br />Part One<br />------------<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Click on &quot;Profile&quot; at the top of the page here on the forums.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; In the left frame that shows up, there will be a list of links.&nbsp; Under the highlighted heading &quot;Modify Profile,&quot; click &quot;Buddies/Ignore List.&quot;<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Moving to the main frame, there will be a link to &quot;Edit Ignore List&quot; -- click on that.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; In the empty field below, enter the username of the member you&#039;d like to ignore.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Click &quot;Add&quot; to start ignoring posts from that member.<br /><br /><br /><br />Part Two:<br />------------<br /><br />1.&nbsp; In the link list shown in the left frame again, click on &quot;Look and Layout&quot; under the &quot;Modify Profile&quot; heading.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Scroll down a bit and make sure you have checked the box next to &quot;Hide messages posted by members on my ignore list.&quot;<br /><br /><br />That should do it!&nbsp; :)

				Thank you for creating this sticky scout, as the forum membership grows so does the diversity of it&#039;s members and not everything posted here is met with universal approval. We do not condone censorship so the best advice is for anyone finding themselves wanting to avoid having to read posts by certain forum members is to put those individuals on their ignore list.<br /><br />

				Awesome! Thanks for the feature mods!<br /><br />(It&#039;s kind of like reverse social networking. Instead of adding people, you can block them until you only see people you&#039;d want on your &#039;friends list&#039; :^P )<br />mostly kidding. Hope everyone had a good weekend!<br />

Users--even the mods--can ignore nonsense more effectively, according to their personal taste. As for spammers and the like, it&#039;s a whole other story....

				Is there anything you can do to stop 0 post members from sending PMs?&nbsp; SR pepinamil and his minions are relentless and must really think I want to buy bulk cocaine since I get at least one message per day from them.&nbsp; Problem is it is a different user each time.
