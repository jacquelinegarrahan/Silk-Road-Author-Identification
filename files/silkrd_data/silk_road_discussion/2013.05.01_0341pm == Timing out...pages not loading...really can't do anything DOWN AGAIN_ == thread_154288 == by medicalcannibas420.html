				Connection to SR is intermittent and sporadic, just like always in my experience!<br /><br />I just keep on trying and refreshing until it connects.

				Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it was traffic-related as others have suggested.&nbsp; The BTC mini-correction may also have something to do with it.

				Ya, here I am trying to process my orders and I am twiddling my thumbs instead.<br /><br />To my customers, your orders may take longer to get out but I will handle them all.

				Thats what I was trying to do.&nbsp; All I want is to be able to get my orders out. It seems impossible right now.<br />Sorry to all my customers as your items might not go out today.&nbsp; Gonna keep trying.&nbsp; Even with tor updated and a constant identity change it seems to be fruitless.&nbsp;

				I think it&#039;s BTC correction. I don&#039;t believe we&#039;re under attack. Keep fingers crossed!<br />

				yea, i&#039;m getting on intermittently, trying to process my orders as well. Vendors - just be sure to load your orders page and then don&#039;t touch it, use it to open windows in other pages. That way you won&#039;t lose your orders page and can process your orders.<br /><br />To my customers - I&#039;m hard at work processing your orders, thanks for all the support, SR really is a great community because we all band together instead of bitching at eachother. That&#039;s why SR will never go away, it&#039;s members are too classy to let it fall apart.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a vendor on many other boards and forums and websites, they all have one thing in common, the feeling of &quot;everyone for themself&quot;. Here it&#039;s the opposite, &quot;all for one and one for all.&quot; is the presiding mentality. It makes my job a whole lot easier when I don&#039;t have to deal with the stress of customers bitching and moaning at the slightest delay. SR customers are the complete opposite, I&#039;m happy to&nbsp; be a part of such a great group of people.<br /><br />QM

				I&#039;m in right now. I restarted Tor though.<br /><br />lmao, the price of BTC is down to around $100. I can&#039;t believe anyone puts up with bitcoins unless they&#039;re buying drugs on the internet.
