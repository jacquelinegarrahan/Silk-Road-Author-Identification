				So, the commission is variable with this rate structure:<br /><br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /><br />I remember reading the commission was based on the entire purchase, so for example if you bought 100 of a $5 item, the commission would be as if you bought one $500 item.<br /><br />However, look at the price if you get add items with multiple quantities. It&#039;s as if the commission is calculated into the item price, and then multiplied by the quantity, when what should happen is the pre-commission price should be multiplied by the quantity and THEN the commission calculated. <br /><br />Example, let&#039;s say an item costs $50 before commission. If you bought one, the true price would be $55. If you bought two, the true price should be $109.25. (10% on the first 50, 8.5% on the second 50). But it&#039;s not. The price ends up being $110. <br /><br />Am I missing something here? This doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s being calculated correctly.

				Good catch.&nbsp; I think the issue was that the shopping cart page was not reflecting the true total amount.&nbsp; Should be sorted out now.&nbsp; If you have any discrepancies on your account, just message support with the details.

				Hmm...something still doesn&#039;t seem right.<br /><br />Let&#039;s use Rook as an example, as Rook was a pioneer in using the unit pricing to enable the purchase of varying amounts of cannabis. Quoting from their page:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Each product will have a low unit price somewhere between $9 - $18. Each unit will afford the buyer *0.6g* of product EXCEPT at the following quantity markers:<br /><br />(5)units = 3.5g (1/8oz)<br />(8)units = 7g (1/4oz)<br />(13)units = 14g (1/2oz)<br />(23)units = 28g (1oz)<br />*(44)units = 56g (2oz)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok, cool, so I pull up an item they have sufficient quantity of, Grape Wreck:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ed1b4baf74<br /><br />$15 (3.02 BTC at the moment) per unit.<br /><br />So, I add it to my shopping cart, and change the units to 23. I would expect the new price to be somewhat lower than 23 x 3.02 BTC, because the 3.02 BTC price is calculated with a 10% commission, and this order would be over $300 so $250+ of the order will be at a commission less than 10%.<br /><br />However, much to my surprise, the total shows as 69.53 BTC. When I multiply 3.02 x 23, I get 69.46. Ok, so it must be that the price is really 3.023 btc per unit. However, yeah, it&#039;s still not reflecting the varying price.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my best guess at what the price should be:<br /><br />We start with $15, and know that has a 10% commission. In other words, 15 = (True Cost) x (1.1), so true cost is something like $13.64 (if we round up).&nbsp; 23 x $13.64 = $313.72. <br /><br />Commission would be $5 on the first 50, $8.50 on the portion from $50-150, $9 on the portion from $150-300, and $0.41 on the remaining $13.72. Adding up the commissions, we get $22.91, for a grand total of $336.63. Using the same bitcoin conversion of $4.96/btc that was being used earlier, we find that rather than a grand total of 69.53 btc as my shopping cart shows, it instead should be 67.87 btc.<br /><br />Please feel free to correct something if I miscalculated.

				@oso<br />You should calculate with display price in bitcoin. If you have display in $ it will give you average from MtGox.

				I looked everything over again and it appears to be in order.&nbsp; If we look at the Grape Wreck (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ed1b4baf74), one unit currently costs 3.07 btc or roughly $15.&nbsp; If we increase the quantity to 20, the price becomes 60.04 btc or about 3 btc per item ($14.67).&nbsp; This is congruent with the current commission schedule.<br /><br />Regarding oso&#039;s purple kush, he is using pre-commission pricing and dollar pegging.&nbsp; The pre-commission price is set to $290.&nbsp; After commission, this is $311.9 or about 7.6% commission.&nbsp; At the current rate of 4.89 btc per usd, the current in-cart price of 63.78 btc is correct.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure why you were seeing 52.25 btc, but at the current rate it should be more like 59.30 btc.

				Perhaps I had some cacheing or some other issue.<br /><br />I do see it working properly now.<br /><br />When I pick the Grape Wreck with quantity 1, it&#039;s 3.07 btc per unit, but when I do 20 units it drops the per unit price to 3 btc per unit. I&#039;m not going to bother with the math right now, but I&#039;m confident in things because before the price per unit wouldn&#039;t drop when I adjusted the quantity.<br /><br />Thanks!
