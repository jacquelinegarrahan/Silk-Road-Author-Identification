				So. Is there a brave soul out there willing to go undercover and see what this is all about? I dont&#039;t think SR is legit up and running again, but I am curious as to what you can see. Is it possible to get your coins out? hm. Let me know if we got any explorers in the bunch. I am half tempted to login myself.

				Here is how I found it; message from Silkmirror on sheep<br /><br />SilkMirror &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,<br />I am one of the people working on the old Silk Road marketplace and I would just like to inform You, that we were able to transport the entire page with user database from our latest backup to new site. To login, visit this page:<br /><br />http://sv3p2vkb6v54xh56.onion<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to create new account if you had one on old page. The database was transferred, so your old login informations will work*. Unfortunately, we were not able to transfer any of the old offers on the page, and the FBI seized all Bitcoins located on users wallets. Also, there has been a small change in rules, to provide more safety for You users and us developers. But other than that, it is pretty much the same as it was before.<br />We hope that you share the word and we can come back to the quality it was before.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Mr. G.<br /><br />*The database backup is from 9/27/2013, so if you registered after this date, you will have to register again.

Definitely not legit.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what to make of the JS, but NoScript didn&#039;t detect any scripts being run at least. I&#039;m a small time buyer running TAILS on a live DVD (along with other security measures). I&#039;m not terribly concerned about it; but I wouldn&#039;t log in if I were a vendor. <br /><br />I should have read the whole fucking thread before I went there though. I saw the thread stickied by Libertas called &quot;we rise again,&quot; and thought this *might* be real, but yeah, no, it&#039;s not. <br /><br />The post by Libertas is a new forum link.<br /><br />EDIT: I doubt very much this is LE. They can&#039;t be that fucking dumb. There&#039;s not even an option to change the BTC address. And requiring buyers to make a deposit to &quot;activate their accounts&quot; is fucking retarded. I think they used the posted SR backups to get the user IDs, because I tried logging in with a fake, it wouldn&#039;t take it. I got an error saying &quot;Please log in with your real SR user name and password.&quot; I&#039;m thinking Nigerian prince is more likely than LE here, but I could be wrong.

Looks more like a hastily thrown together website made to scam vulnerable people. <br /><br />Notice how everyone has the same BTC address. The owners are just pocketing people&#039;s money and will close down the website when the cost to host it exceeds the income they&#039;re getting from it.

				Be careful guys, DPR was arrested while chatting online in the library to a &#039;Co-operating&#039; witness... someone very high up in the system here is a rat.. that&#039;s if the whole thing is not compromised.<br /><br />I highly suggest mooving away from SR or anything related to it.
