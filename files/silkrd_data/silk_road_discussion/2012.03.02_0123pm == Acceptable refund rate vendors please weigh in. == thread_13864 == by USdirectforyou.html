				So I keep getting clients wanting pretty large orders with stats like&nbsp; 3/36% with iether large or small amounts of money but than I also get buyers who have MANY buys like 40-50 and have spent 5k plus but have crazy refund rates. How do you pick and choose a potential scam buyer?

				I hate to say it but I try and just go with my gut and a little common sense.<br />If someone wanted a pound of weed and they didn&#039;t have stellar, off the charts purchasing stats I would&nbsp; break it up into quarters and ship it a quarter at a time... get one, finalize... send another.<br />In the end I am the one who is taking the majority loss if things go bad so I don&#039;t think asking someone, with not so solid stats, to work with me is asking to much.<br />&nbsp;&#039;ALL&#039; sellers need some kind of &#039;Refund Policy&#039; on their main seller page and on each item listing... yeah I know it is a hassle especially if you have a ton of listings but if it came down to SR making a decision on a dispute between a buyer and a seller I would think the Refund Policy would hold considerable weight.<br />Lastly I am not Pablo Escobar... I cannot afford to lose shipments to the post office and cheating buyers. My 50/50 policy is designed to lessen the impact of an interdicted package on myself and the buyer and in the case of a cheating buyer he only gets half his money back so hopefully he will pick a richer seller instead of someone selling cheap weed.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are far to many loopholes in this system to ever make me feel safe to sell to anyone... in the end all we have is our gut and a little common sense.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />TJ

				I can&#039;t vouch for others but I always buy large and I would be upset if I ordered a LB and I got a QP and then 5 days later get another and another and so on I put the money out to purchase then I would like my full order This vendor I deal with now allows me to escrow till my shipment arrives and thats great because real suck to lose $2500 in coin and him losing $2500 in product the escrow is a safety feature for buyer &amp; seller.<br /><br />you will almost always have to take a chance as there are alot of us as new members including me I found the vendor that I wanted to deal with and sent him a couple emails and then purchases and now things are great and I think there would be only 2 vendors that I would what I am looking for (HASH) if I wanted coke I would have to find <br />two other vendors for that product<br /><br />as TJ said you have to use common sense and guts<br /><br />BigBill6778
