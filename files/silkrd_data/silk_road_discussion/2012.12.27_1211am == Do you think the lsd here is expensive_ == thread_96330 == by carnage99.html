				There are some great prices here, but the lsd seems expensive. I have heard lsd has taken hits in recent years(i.e. busts, price hikes,etc) but i dont know if this is rumor or what. I remember 4-5 years ago I used to get it cheap as long as I spent 100$, i would get a sheet of 20-30 hits for that price in person.<br /><br />What do you guys think? Any insight? Thanks

				fuck yes I do.&nbsp; in my area, I&#039;ve never paid more than $400 for a sheet of 100 hits, and those were easily 200-250ug (based on the fact that everyone I know got utterly wasted off of 2, including myself and some other very experienced users).&nbsp; More usual is $325 or $350 for white-on-white.

				I remember when 10 strips cost $40 and sheets were like $175. Supply dropped drastically after William Leonard Pickard got busted in 2000, and prices went way up. I haven&#039;t tried the LSD on SR, but the reviews indicate that you can get a good trip (actual visuals) off a single hit of most of the stuff sold there, which is better than the street acid I&#039;ve done. I usually had to eat half of a $40 ten strip to get visuals. :)

				I only buy LSD from one vendor here, and it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; The prices are decent, about ~6/7 a hit and usually pretty good dosage on each tab.&nbsp; Honestly I don&#039;t paying top dollar for good acid, so long as it&#039;s GOOD ACID.

				It can be expensive on here. I remember me and a few friends would get sheets of 100ug WoW from a connect we met at a festival for 300 a sheet and 2500 for a 10 pack. Those were the days. But that connection dried up a year or so back, so i dont mind paying a bit extra if its top quality like 3janes, or like tony76&#039;s used to be.

				It&#039;s more expensive here for sure but the quality is also more consistent with good acid vendors.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done bad acid off SR, and I&#039;ve tried quite a few vendors. Among my circle of real life psychedelic connects, sheets and tabs are noticeably cheaper but sometimes the quality isn&#039;t all that great.&nbsp; Also a lot of these people live about 50 - 100 miles away so I have to factor in travel expenses including the time I spend going back and forth to buy from them.&nbsp; Having said that though the best tabs I ever did were ones I bought from various street connects over the years, one batch from the mid 2000&#039;s had a trippy picture of Ganesha printed on them, another had a picture by Leonardo Da Vinci and the other sheet had a picture of a Rolling Stones album cover.&nbsp; At the moment though I don&#039;t think I need to worry about how much it costs, since I&#039;ve come to acquire pretty much a lifetime supply for one person, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever even get around to dropping all the acid I already have stored up.<br /><br />The only drug I can&#039;t get cheaper in real life (which I take) is MDMA, I&#039;m not sure why it goes for more on the street. The main reason I use SR is for the convenience because quite honestly I&#039;m lazy and can&#039;t be bothered to go out to see dealers now that I have SR.&nbsp; In the past year since I started using SR I&#039;ve come to realize I used to drive pretty far to buy shit, but now I very rarely even leave my house when it comes to buying drugs.&nbsp; Gotta love the digital revolution!<br />

				Back when the &#039;dead&#039; were around I could get a sheet( a hundred is what I call a sheet)for 60$usd, 10 sheets were 500$, the liquid was good too.&nbsp; That blue stuff with the little plunger on the end of the vial.&nbsp; Yeah, been there.&nbsp; Now it depends on the person.&nbsp; If someone really just wants a good clean trip it may be worth 10 bucks a hit to them.&nbsp; Someone looking at spreading the good cheer needs to be close to a source.&nbsp; Get to know someone who knows the guy, thats where you wanna be.&nbsp; Even after the dead there were alot of great deals still out there.&nbsp; One run can get alot of sheets, and I mean alot, and vials of liquid too.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor but to give you an idea of what the deal is;&nbsp; there were guys selling sheets for 60 and they were doubling their money on each page(sheet).&nbsp; Rainbow buses, etc.&nbsp; I won&#039;t say anymore, but you deadheads out there know what I&#039;m talkin about.&nbsp;

				I havent had acid now for about 20 years and seeing it on here (newbie to SR) has given me a appetite for it again, just for old times sake.&nbsp; I used to do it in the late 80&#039;s early 90&#039;s am nearly in my 40s now.<br /><br />In my day there were batmans, sonics, strawberries, bart simpsons, buddahs, ying yangs and scooby doo.&nbsp; The best though were the microdots, looked on here and cant find them.<br /><br />As for sourcing them I cant source them for love nor money and nor can anyone else I know and I am a regular coke and MDMA user and none of my boys can get hold of them, that is until I canl now and shall be indulging soon<br /><br />As for prices on SR I dont know as I have nothing to compare them to a local market but say they are easily good enough prices for me

				Yeah, no disrespect to the vendors, some of the prices are pretty fair. I&#039;m just surprised there aren&#039;t more people selling cheap, considering they are small, easy to ship, dont have to invest as much $ as some other products. Maybe because it&#039;s just to hard to get from the source and people are still buying them regardless. There have been some better listings over the last 2 weeks or so than there were from what I can see. I&#039;ve been reading the forum a little bit-seems best to keep coins on acct, wait, find a deal and trusted vendor. LSD seems a bit popular here, bunch of vendors selling out regularly and such. I&#039;m a bit skeptical to order a good bit b/c i bought some here last year and it was some sort of rc laid to blotter (and he had a perfect feedback rating , ugh). Also lots of vendors seem to overstate the micrograms or they degenerate or whatever. I guess there&#039;s a lot more info w/ the forum nowadays. <br />stiffneck: who had the sheets of avatar from for a good price?

				I would say yes. I *used* to be able to get 10 strips for $40USD. But I say *used* to because you cannot find any at all where I live. So I am extremely grateful to have stumbled upon the wondrous silk road so I can trip again. Without the LSD here I would have none at all. Small price to pay. If you can get it cheaper go get it!

				Wasn&#039;t it a trigger 13 years ago?<br /><br />&quot;Gordon Todd Skinner (known by friends as Todd) is an autodidact chemist of uncertain ability; indeed, whether he is a chemist at all is subject to debate. He allegedly performed his first mescaline extraction from L. williamsii at the age of 19. By 25, he was incarcerated and facing life in a New Jersey prison for trafficking 42 pounds of marijuana. In order to beat the charges, he began a long and fruitful career as a government informant. In 1996, he purchased a decommissioned Atlas E nuclear-missile silo in Wamego, Kansas, and transformed it into a subterranean psychedelic palace. Three years later, he purchased a second silo to house an LSD superlab.

Simply dismissing Todd as a snitch would ignore the fact that he seemed to possess a deep and honest commitment to the distribution of psychedelic drugs for the betterment of mankind, which makes what he did all the more complex.&quot;

				To me trips should not be expensive because its not about the money anyway.&nbsp; Tripping often is a fun time, but it can also be a time when your eyes are opened and you realize things you never realized before, creativity flows, ideas form, new insight is gained. Why charge alot for trips anyway?&nbsp; Any idea how many drops you can get from an ounce of liquid?&nbsp; Too many. Seriously, people that know the guy; just give some away. Thats really how it works.&nbsp; The trips take on a life of their own and stuff just happens.&nbsp; Really, you can be trippin out and smoke half a bag of week, drink half a case of beer, do a gram of coke, and you&#039;re still trippin. What a long strange trip its been.

				The truth is; the lsd is expensive, but if you know the right person it shouldn&#039;t be that much.&nbsp; The real street acid used to have a strycnine and speed cut on it at approx a 100 mics per hit.&nbsp; Price then was 5$usd per hit for singles. 10 hits were 30$,&nbsp; 25 were 75$, 50 for 100$.&nbsp; If your close to the liquid, how much money do you think that is?&nbsp; The trick was staying one step ahead of LE in the process.&nbsp; Putting several layers between you and LE is important and keeping the cardinal rule of only dealing directly with certain people and thats it, basically pyramid style.&nbsp; The game is part of it.&nbsp; It ain&#039;t always easy, but it sure is fun, lol.
