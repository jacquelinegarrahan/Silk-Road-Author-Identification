				The fees are like taxes. It starts at 10% for the first $50 then goes down as the price of the item goes up. I think it tops out at 2-3% for things that are over 1k.

Here&#039;s an example from DPR&#039;s State of the Road Address:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.msg76738#msg76738">Quote from: State of the Road Address on January 09, 2012, 03:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.&nbsp; The average response looked like this:<br /><br />15% of the first $10<br />11% of $10 - $50<br />8.14% of $50 - $250<br />5.6% of $250 - $1000<br />3.7% of $1000 - $5000<br /><br />We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:<br /><br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In a $300 sale, for example:<br /><br />$50 is charged at 10% of the first $50, so $5 fee.<br />$100 is charged at 8.5% of the next $50 - $100, so $8.50 fee.<br />$150 is charged at 6% of the final $150 - $300, so $9 fee.<br /><br />Total: $300.<br />Total commission: $22.50<br />Total paid to vendor for item: $277.50<br />Total paid to vendor for item, if hedging order (@ 4% hedging fee): $266.40<br /><br /><br />In a $1016 sale, for example:<br /><br />$50 is charged at 10% from the $0 - $50 point, so $5 fee.<br />$100 is charged at 8.5% from the $50 - $100 point, so $8.50 fee.<br />$150 is charged at 6% from the $150 - $300 point, so $9 fee.<br />$200 is charged at 3% from the $300 - $500 point, so $6 fee.<br />$500 is charged at 2% from the $500 - $1000 point, so $10 fee.<br />$16 is charged at 1.5% from the $1000 and up point, so $0.24 fee.<br /><br />Total: $1016.<br />Total commission: $38.74<br />Total paid to vendor for item: $977.26<br />Total paid to vendor for item, if hedging order (@ 4% hedging fee): $938.17<br /><br /><br />You may also be interested in the post I wrote in response to a question asked by Bungee54 about pre-commission and post-commission pricing. That post explains how much you get if you choose pre-commission, how much you get if you choose post-commission, how much you get if you decide to hedge, and what the customer will actually see on the listing itself depending on the option you choose.<br />You can find that post here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=37765.msg429683#msg429683<br /><br /><br />Regarding &#039;start up costs&#039;, the only costs are your initial product, your initial packaging materials, and $500.00 to purchase vending privileges (aka a vendor account).<br />The &#039;running costs&#039; are the commission fee charged on your sales, the hedging fee (if you wish to hedge your orders), more product, more packaging materials, other overheads (fuel etc.), and cashing out your Bitcoin safely.<br /><br />After that you&#039;ll need to properly launder your money if you wish to spend it, which will also cost anywhere from 5% to 60%+, depending on the methods used, the distance created between you and the source, etc.<br /><br />You will have to do your own research on money laundering and cashing out.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Hey, does that mean there will be another State of the Road address in a few weeks? Excited :)<br /><br />Also, a little off topic, but it has to do with vending. It&#039;s something I just noticed. If theft (identity, property) is unacceptable on SR, why are coupon forgeries allowed? That&#039;s quite clearly theft. Agorism is about voluntary trade, and these companies aren&#039;t volunteering for the discounts.<br /><br />Example<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b5698f6c44<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=60672.0

They shouldn&#039;t be allowed. I get the sense that the SR admins err on the side of less enforcement of item policies, especially in borderline cases. Some vendors advertise straight stolen goods too.

Additionally, if all fraud were to majically stop right now, companies would not lower prices to make up for their higher profits. It&#039;s already built into the system and I stand by my statement. While defrauding companies may raise costs for the average consumer. I&#039;m still all for it. I think it&#039;s entirely different than defrauding an individual who will take 100% of the loss, and am unsure any potential savings would be passed on if fraud against corperations was somehow stopped. There would most likely be better earnings, not lower prices.
