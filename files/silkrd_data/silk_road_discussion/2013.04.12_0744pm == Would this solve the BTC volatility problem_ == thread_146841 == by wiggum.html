				Buyers should be required to put x% more money in escrow than the purchase price.&nbsp; x% could be set each day by SR admin based on current BTC volatility.&nbsp; The USD value of the product is locked in on the day the order is placed.&nbsp; When the order is finalized, the vendor receives the product&#039;s USD value out of escrow.&nbsp; Based on the current BTC/USD exchange rate on finalization date, the remaining BTC in escrow is distributed to both parties.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />Day 1:&nbsp; SR admin has set a 50% premium on escrow deposits based on the current BTC volatility.&nbsp; Buyer places an order for a product that costs 10 BTC, and therefore deposits 15 BTC into escrow.&nbsp; On day 1, the BTC/USD exchange rate is 1BTC = 200USD, so the USD value of the product is 2000 USD.<br /><br />Day 5:&nbsp; Product arrives and buyer finalizes.&nbsp; The exchange rate has now become 1 BTC = 150 USD, but the product is still worth 2000 USD.&nbsp; To receive 2000 USD out of escrow, the vendor is entitled to 13.33 BTC.&nbsp; The remaining 1.67 BTC is returned to the buyer, and the transaction is complete.&nbsp; Neither party has been screwed.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s assume the same facts, except that on day 5 the exchange rate is 1 BTC = 250 USD.&nbsp; For the vendor to receive his 2000 USD, he gets 8 BTC out of escrow and the remaining 7 BTC is returned to buyer.&nbsp; Neither party has been screwed.<br /><br />Buyers will complain that it&#039;s unfair to put more money in escrow than the product is worth, but tough cookies.&nbsp; You&#039;ll get back the same USD value of BTC after the transaction is over.<br /><br />Also, sellers could entice buyers by taking the risk to require lower escrow premiums.&nbsp; For example, if SR admin sets an escrow premium of 50%, vendors looking to attract business (especially new vendors looking to build customer base) could set a 25% premium.&nbsp; The vendor is taking more exchange risk, but he will attract more customers to compensate.<br /><br />Any flaws in this framework?

I don&#039;t see how this is an improvement. It seems like more complexity with little gain.
