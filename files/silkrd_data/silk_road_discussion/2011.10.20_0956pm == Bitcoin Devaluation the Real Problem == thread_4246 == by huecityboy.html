				I&#039;m as concerned as anybody about SR being down.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got two sellers I can&#039;t finalize on, because of it.&nbsp; But this same thing happened a few months ago, and we whethered it, but at that time, our newfound--and unwanted--notoriety seemed to be accompanied by btc going thru the roof.&nbsp; Over 20 bucks best I remember.&nbsp; <br /><br />But btc since those days have been constantly dropping in value.&nbsp; Makes it hard to do business if it&#039;s not stable.&nbsp; And exchanges have been going haywire also.&nbsp; First MtGox, then HillTrade quit taking dwolla, then it took them with bitinstant, but that was down until it came back up again yesterday.&nbsp; Then we finally get a good one to do business with, exchangebitcoin, and damn if *they* don&#039;t go down.<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel as optomistic this time, as I did last time SR went down.&nbsp; It seems some other currency needs to be created.&nbsp; Something tied to the dollar, or the pound, or the peso, I don&#039;t care, but something controlled at a central source so we could continue with our anonymity.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just don&#039;t know how it would be done.&nbsp; BTC is one of the main attractions about SR.&nbsp; Need some genius out there to figure out another one...

				Yep, me too...feel kind of bad for two sellers right now: I can&#039;t get on to finalize their orders, and btc&#039;s are dropping quickly and i don&#039;t think they were hedged.&nbsp; <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t seem to matter so much *where* it stops, as long as it stops somewhere...but we&#039;ll have a hell of a time trading and buying them if they don&#039;t settle down, as the exchange shops will shut down...they&#039;re having troubles as it is....

				Bitcoins are revolutionary in that they are NOT controlled by any government. It&#039;s value goes up and down depending on people&#039;s confidence in it, and by saying you don&#039;t support the bitcoin, you&#039;re helping devalue it.<br /><br />Do you seriously want to give your freedom away to a &quot;leader&quot; just so you can feel safe? That&#039;s so sad in my opinion.

				As long as we don&#039;t get paid in fixed rates and not pegged, BTC isn&#039;t really a currency, only a token.

				Its very difficult to watch this happen, but I honestly feel we are getting somewhat close to a bottom.&nbsp; Go to bitcoincharts.com and look at the 1 year graph.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bitcoin was gradually increasing until late April when it started to get a little publicity, then Schumer made his comments about bitcoin / SR and the price shot up.&nbsp; People heard about it - lots of anti-government / independent / libertarian people were very interested (to some degree I put myself right in there with them at that point).&nbsp; The price skyrocketed, sellers refused to sell, buyers - most of them who were brand new to bitcoin and had no idea what they cost 1 month previous -&nbsp; were paying anything for one.&nbsp; Since the marketplace for bitcoins didn&#039;t exist at that point, other that SR, there wasn&#039;t much reason to have the coins.&nbsp; Once the price started dropping more and more people started selling because they didn&#039;t want to the person holding the bag.<br /><br />My point in all of this is we are getting down fairly close to where we were before the price bubble due to all the unjustified hype that started back in April.&nbsp; And in the interim there have been DDOS attacks on the miners and MtGox, various scammers, threats, etc, and the bitcoin protocol itself has not been shown to have any holes.&nbsp; I think that is an incredible statement to the quality of the protocol and the underlying code.&nbsp; And SR itself has proven consistently that if you can buy coins anonymously you CAN transfer value anonymously.&nbsp; <br /><br />I for one hope bitcoins don&#039;t get much publicity for awhile, I think the price will drop down another 50% or so, near parity with the pound or euro or dollar and then hopefully it will be stable or start increasing slowly based on fundamental value of the bitcoin network and not in the bubble fashion we saw a few months ago.<br /><br />It was always going to be difficult to get bitcoin on stable footing, but I think it has weathered a difficult storm and still works - hopefully SR can weather the storm it is currently facing and continue providing the service that it does.&nbsp;
