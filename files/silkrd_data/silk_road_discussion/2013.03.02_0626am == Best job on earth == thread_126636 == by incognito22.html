				I&#039;m sure there&#039;s certain downsides. Like feeling tied to one&#039;s computer, worrying about not standing out or slipping 24/7, possibly dealing with &quot;stupid&quot; people. even with that it could still be the best job. man, i feel like i&#039;d have a lot of fun being a vendor. I&#039;d like to hear from a vendor on this though.

				yeah its not a bad screw ATM - i&#039;ve been in &#039;the game&#039; for want of a less used phrase, 15 years on and off in some capaicity IRW, but the last year slowly SR activity has replaced RW pretty much completely!!<br /><br />I find it alot less driving of big weights around, jus sat in front of a computer most of the time , and regular trips to post office etc... much lower risk in general (touch wood), but like any relatively new thing, the worry is always there of what will happen next y&#039;know..? How long before the Establishment criminalize BTC or pull down SR..?! obviously i am praying it lasts forever but i fear the bigger it grows the more attention the US governement will pay to it, eventually targeting it in their futile pantomime-like &quot;War on Drugs&quot;..<br /><br />yeah there are a few shitty dickheads (mostly newbies obvs) and scammers trying it on etc... but nothing you don&#039;t have IRW dealing anyway...<br /><br />personally i am quite sociable, so before i would be meeting friends alot more, and taking alot more drooogs in these social situations (which were occurring repeatedly daily!) so in a way SR has taken the face2face element away , ergo ,&nbsp; i am taking alot less droogs these days, which is a fucking good thing for me ;-)<br /><br />Hurray for SR and all those who sail in her.! hehe<br /><br />please take 2 mins check out my little shop and read my profile, lemme know what you think guys..?!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/16e11f8977<br /><br />Yours D x

				I&#039;ve been a vendor on here a year now and I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s the best job I&#039;ve ever had but it&#039;s not the worst either, it is a lot more work than you might think and some of the people I deal with are also a mix of good and bad. Overall I&#039;m glad I started selling here, it has been a real adventure to say the least.<br />

				RL drug dealings a doddle as long as you stay away from the muppets - when i sold IRL it used to be mainly mates, but any new customers had to have references from 2 separate current customers. if i got fucked about twice by the same person i changed my number and gave it to everyone except the person that fucked me about

				would be cool to sell on the road..

Worked 13 months between 40-60 hour weeks with 4 days of vacation (family member died)&nbsp; just to have it all stolen from me. Lost another 3grand in court (EVEN WINNING THE FUCKN CASE)&nbsp; still couldn&#039;t retrieve any money.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m just saving all my money from this so i can go back to school and finish my degrees.

				It seems like a lot of work to me, you have to worry about keeping your packaging top notch and product quality good or risk falling ratings and negative comments on the forums. That being said, it is a pretty cool gig and I am thankful for all the vendors who do it well!

				I don&#039;t know if I could do it, but it does seem like a great job at least the selling part, for some of the drugs actually obtaining it in RL might still be a hassle. All I know is I&#039;m very thankful and appreciative of every one of the vendors, even the ones that sell drugs that I would never touch just simply because it should be available if someone desires or needs it. I&#039;m especially forever grateful for the acid vendors, I&#039;ve wanted to try it my entire life but never thought for the sake of my life that I would find any (real) acid, especially in my area the people are so sketchy and the most you can find locally without effort would either be weed, crack, H or coke and probably the lowest quality of everything except the weed, anything else and you&#039;d have to really search and ask around, something I never wanted to do. So thank you, SR and the vendors!

Also, Dealing with the consequences of packages that dont get delivered or with customers that lie about their package not making it is also a great annoyance.<br /><br />I want to clarify that been a vendor is very stressful psychologically and physically bc there is a lot that goes into the process of customers getting their drugs via mail. It sounds easy but a lot goes into it and is actually is quite time consuming. For example I dont sell LSD but I know that making LSD is very very hard and growing pot is hard as well and making the product is just part of running a business in SR. <br /><br />What is cool about this job is knowing that you are helping others have access of quality medicine like pot in a safe manner that they would otherwise not have access to. Getting great feedback that illustrates how happy I have made some people is what motivates me to keep doing what I do and is what makes me happy about this way of making a living.

				Way back when I was a seller in the beginning of the road I loved it. I made so much so quickly it was amazing. The best part was I no longer had to worry about anything really. It is just a shitload of work. When I was a vendor I was so careful. And I had to spent hours and hours every day just on the being careful aspect. Tho I would do it again in an instant. In fact I plan on it.

Sure the tor network is slow sometimes, but oftern times it&#039;s just fine, stay off at super busy times. In the real world, you have phone/fax/etc.. but here we just have this. So this is probably the biggest point against being an SR vendor.<br /><br />Having to advertise and put up listings with the right prices<br /><br />&nbsp;This point has absolutely no bearing on vending on SilkRoad. All businesses in all markets must do two things to survive:<br />1. Advertise<br />2. Be competitively priced<br />Not advertising means no business, pricing too low or too high means you either lose product or customers. The economics of vending are pretty complex and most of the pricing is actually set by the market (eg. 5% under the competition average).<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Having to cash out bitcoins<br /><br />This isn&#039;t an issue if you launder your coins, you can just sell them and wire the money... in real life, you have to deal with payments and taxes.. the cost of bitcoin work is cheaper than taxes :)<br /><br />Having to hope the market for bitcoins remains stable<br /><br />&nbsp;If your national currency loses face, you&#039;re SOL, if bitcoin loses face, you&#039;re SOL, it&#039;s a crap storm regardless :)<br /><br />Having to deal with the idiot customers<br /><br />There are idiot customers in every business, this is not solely a SR thing... my clients are the most reasonable people on here :)<br /><br />Having to hope the postal system moves their stuff fast<br /><br />Considering I worked an eBay business before this, this is a dumb complaint. Pay an extra $10 and buy expressmail which is roughly one or two day service to the 48 states... and 3-5 days worldwide.<br /><br />Having to constantly cover your tracks and make sure you don&#039;t get caught<br /><br />In terms of drug dealing, I think it&#039;d be more nerveracking IRL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In terms of every other trade, this is okay...<br /><br />Having to deal with IRL dealers/manufactures/sources<br /><br />Most dealers will find SR anyways, if you&#039;re a middleman, you better be looking to move up the chain.

				The hardest part of the job is emptying your inbox.<br /><br />Wake up everyday to: &quot;inbox: 51&quot;<br /><br />43 of those messages always go like: &quot;Short&nbsp; on a BTC, can you custom list me a gram for what I&#039;m short on?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Can you make me a custom listing for 2.2 grams&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I bought from you, and then it AutoFinalized and my product never came. Can you refund me&quot; - and these messages are from people who have never bought from you before. <br /><br />Last time I got one, and messaged back saying I had reported him to SR staff. And he sent me a really abusive message, which I never bothered replying to. Then an hour later sent me like a 2000 word apology, what an cunt. <br /><br />Other than that, it&#039;s pretty fun to vend here.

Sure the tor network is slow sometimes, but oftern times it&#039;s just fine, stay off at super busy times. In the real world, you have phone/fax/etc.. but here we just have this. So this is probably the biggest point against being an SR vendor.<br /><br />Having to advertise and put up listings with the right prices<br /><br />&nbsp;This point has absolutely no bearing on vending on SilkRoad. All businesses in all markets must do two things to survive:<br />1. Advertise<br />2. Be competitively priced<br />Not advertising means no business, pricing too low or too high means you either lose product or customers. The economics of vending are pretty complex and most of the pricing is actually set by the market (eg. 5% under the competition average).<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Having to cash out bitcoins<br /><br />This isn&#039;t an issue if you launder your coins, you can just sell them and wire the money... in real life, you have to deal with payments and taxes.. the cost of bitcoin work is cheaper than taxes :)<br /><br />Having to hope the market for bitcoins remains stable<br /><br />&nbsp;If your national currency loses face, you&#039;re SOL, if bitcoin loses face, you&#039;re SOL, it&#039;s a crap storm regardless :)<br /><br />Having to deal with the idiot customers<br /><br />There are idiot customers in every business, this is not solely a SR thing... my clients are the most reasonable people on here :)<br /><br />Having to hope the postal system moves their stuff fast<br /><br />Considering I worked an eBay business before this, this is a dumb complaint. Pay an extra $10 and buy expressmail which is roughly one or two day service to the 48 states... and 3-5 days worldwide.<br /><br />Having to constantly cover your tracks and make sure you don&#039;t get caught<br /><br />In terms of drug dealing, I think it&#039;d be more nerveracking IRL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In terms of every other trade, this is okay...<br /><br />Having to deal with IRL dealers/manufactures/sources<br /><br />Most dealers will find SR anyways, if you&#039;re a middleman, you better be looking to move up the chain.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not arguing whether it&#039;s easier or harder than an actual business. That&#039;s up for debate. But best job on earth....no.

				I&#039;d feel bad about asking vendors for slightly lower prices when I&#039;m a tad short on BTC... But many vendors agree, and get my business. And my reviews. I write almost a full word document on the SR anonymous reviews thingy... <br /><br />So don&#039;t spur a newbie just because you can, and you&#039;re a dick. You&#039;ll miss out on money, and he&#039;ll probably tell people on the SR forums about how much of a dick you are. I would.&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve got to say this is a pretty great job. I make nowhere near enough to to live off this long term, but SR and other work I do with bitcoins are the perfect combination of interesting, rebellious, and of course profitable. Especially considering my current employment situation, SR has been a great thing for me. I have been fortunate enough to have never dealt with an ill intentioned customer on here and in the one instance something was brought to the resolution center just gave a full refund without question.

				Its definitely up there in my opinion, and better then RL dealing for the most part as far as risk goes its definitely better.<br /><br />I think people in the underground health world got it the best though just helping people improve there body and minds through lifestyle choices they get to blog and make youtube videos and make decent cash through there products or affiliate products<br /><br />Carders also got it pretty good for the ones that know what they&#039;re doing still pretty morally sound too cause the people usually get there money back so your just shafting the CC company&nbsp;
