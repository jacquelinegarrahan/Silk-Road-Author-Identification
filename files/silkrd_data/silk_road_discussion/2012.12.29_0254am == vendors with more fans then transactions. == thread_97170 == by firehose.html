				They probably created a bunch of dummy accounts to make their vendor page look better. I&#039;d be cautious about buying from vendors like that, there are plenty of reliable vendors with a well established transaction history. Number of fans isn&#039;t a real good indicator of vendor quality anyway, their feedback is what you need to look at.

				I don&#039;t think anyone will waste so much time making dummy accounts just to become fan.<br />If they make dummy accounts i m sure they ll make dummy transactions too. <br />Buyers become &quot;fans&quot; usually to have them on their watchlist on their main page and check them out occasionally.&nbsp; I have more &quot;favourite&quot; vendors than I have bought from actually.

				I &quot;fan&quot; any vendor that I am thinking of using because it puts their vendor link on my main page so I don&#039;t have to search for them.

				It doesn&#039;t mean anything. If anything a vendor would fake transactions.

				I also have a bunch of vendors who I become a fan of.&nbsp; It is a lot easier than bookmarking a listing you might be interested in buying in the future When I go back to my bookmarks most of them no longer work and I have to go through and delete them all.

				I have numerous vendors on my favorites that I have not made a purchase from. I find it difficult to search for vendors at times. Flavriting vendors is almost habit as I can go back to look at their offerings quickly.
