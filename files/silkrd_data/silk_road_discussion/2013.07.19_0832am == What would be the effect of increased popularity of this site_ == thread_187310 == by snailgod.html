				I&#039;ve been thinking about this. Let&#039;s say major news media start running articles about the site and people start flocking to it. What would the consequences be?<br /><br />For one, the authorities would no doubt consider it a higher priority to try to find the site and shut it down. The question is can they really do any more than they&#039;re doing already? I&#039;m sure shutting it down is already a high priority for them up there with busting drug lords and yet here we are...<br /><br />Two, they&#039;ll likely increase their efforts to busting individual sellers and buyers, but since they&#039;ll be so many more to bust, it might actually make an individual&#039;s odds of getting busted lower as you&#039;ll more easily get lost in the crowd, much like how the music and movie industry started going after people sharing copyrighted stuff but as many people as there were doing it, they couldn&#039;t even put a dent in it.<br /><br />Three, it&#039;s always great to have more options to choose from and more potential buyers. However, it could attract a less savory group of people and the quality of the place could go down.<br /><br />These are a few thoughts I&#039;ve had. I thought I&#039;d get others&#039; takes on it.

				The main issue I see moving forward as the site gets more popular is scalability of SR and TOR hidden services in general. Just how many users can the TOR network handle? I&#039;ve seen the average number of relays at any given time stuck at 3,000 or so for a long time now, and this number will no doubt have to increase (along with exit nodes, etc) for SR to continue to handle the influx of new users.

However, the vast majority of people still haven&#039;t heard of it.

				i found out about SR through Forbes only about a month or two ago<br /><br />i feel like most people arent comfortable with computers/technology to follow all of the instructions and may give up before they even make it on the site. there are also a lot of paranoid people out there who may be interested in trying the site but dont have the balls.<br /><br />i think the site inherently has failsafes to avoid things like this. its very hard to pinpoint a vendors exact location, especially if they use multiple addresses(which happen to be fake)<br /><br />the limitations of the TOR network, however might play a different role<br /><br />cool thread, interested in others opinions

				I&#039;ve been on SR for over two years. I remember being able to get envelopes of ketamine from Pakistan way before SR was even here.&nbsp; The cat has been out of the bag for the longest time.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a secret.&nbsp; I will always miss the good old days, but this place has really grown into something spectacular.&nbsp;

				when it hits the mass media the forum will be flooded with underage kiddies, trolls and even more people asking the same questions over and over again instead of using the search function.<br />the number of scammers will go up, the quality of drugs will go down.<br />there will probably be one or 2 self proclaimed internet sherrifs who will forward customer addresses to LE or spread personal info.<br /><br />hate to be so negative, but that&#039;s what i see coming

				Popularity is inevitable, which will induce challenges as a result of market and member saturation, but those challenges are worthy byproduct for social-progression.<br /><br />Call me Utopian, but I still believe this is the start of a united collected consciousness to subvert from mainstream sociopolitical control.<br /><br /><br />We can shape the increased attention by demonstrating integrity, solidarity and consciousnesses, and ostracizing those who wish to disrupt this.<br /><br />I am both very grateful and inspired by SR..&nbsp; &nbsp;

Heck, I&#039;m one of the only ones left who still remember the old &quot;forum&quot; if that even gives the old style any credit at all for how crude it was (but it worked most of the time).<br /><br />As we&#039;ve expanded, look at what has happened. Spam increases, scams have increased, we have a growing set of vendor only a few of which stay around for any long period of time, most flare up then burn out quite quickly. We&#039;ve had infrastructure changes to handle the new demands and threats. SilkRoad survives because it adapts and although not much happens on the surface, below that surface is a very well oiled machine of hundreds of vendors spendings hours every day packing and managing orders, processing money, admins sorting disputes, DPR fixing bugs and checking for the latest threats, drugs being couriered in bulk and resold across the world. As long as we continue to evolve then we will be fine. The only problem with this however is SR tends to evolve responsively or when something goes wrong as opposed to a pro-active approach.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This...so much this.&nbsp; I came in on the Gawker wave over 2 years ago. My original member number was in the low 1000&#039;s, for those that remember.&nbsp; This happened when the Gawker article came out too.&nbsp; People panicked. Chuck Schumer threatened to shut us down. But SR has evolved and has survived.
