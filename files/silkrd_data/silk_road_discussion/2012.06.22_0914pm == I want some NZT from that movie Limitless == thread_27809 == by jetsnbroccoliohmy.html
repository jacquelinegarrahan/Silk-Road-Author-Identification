				Nothing like NZT, but Adderall and Ritalin have concentration and learning boosting effects. <br /><br />If you use them right you can become very successful from them. One tip, don&#039;t take them at weekends, and don&#039;t have an increasing dose.

				the whole point of the movie i that nzt 48 can&#039;t exist and can&#039;t be used for long periods if it did.<br /><br />if such a thing was possible it would never be one pill.<br /><br />i would theorize it would be combination of elctrical regulation, epigenetic and genetic style monkeying with the entire &quot;hgher brain&quot; and good old fashioned neuropharma[ritalin, modafinil etc]<br /><br />the real message might be that the brain like any other system in the body needs treating like a peak performance machine and to use physique terms you could either be Arnie or a Couch potato through your own perseverance. so it might be of the intellect and the emotional wellbeing.<br />which many of you must believe already otherwise no one would be buying all these plants and chemicals :)<br /><br /><br />a good start would be solid chnages to diet and lifestyle then taking big steps with ones real life and then looking up noo tropics and hormones.<br />

Tweak it, take the kicks out. Find out what works and what doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;m off it. I&#039;m 50 moves ahead of you and everybody else.<br /><br />Lol.. it is a great film. B-Coop as always is a pro, the only downside is that the drug doesn&#039;t actually exist. And anyone that did invent it, wouldn&#039;t be dumb enough to tell a single soul.
