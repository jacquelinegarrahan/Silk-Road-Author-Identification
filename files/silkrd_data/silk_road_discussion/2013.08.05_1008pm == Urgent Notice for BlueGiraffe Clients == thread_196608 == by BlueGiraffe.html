			<dd class="postbody">
				This is an urgent notice to all our clients.<br /><br />There has been a massive breach of security due to the following conjunctions:<br /><br />1. I keep a document with all shipping addresses as verification for any re-ships. I know this is specifically against Silk Road’s terms, but I have always kept this totally protected (properly encrypted and completely hidden). I’ve been meaning to remove all personal information and just keep the stats, but had not gotten around to that yet.<br /><br />2. I very recently hired a new assistant to help me process orders. She is totally trustworthy and has access to all documentation. However she made a profound error of judgement a couple of days ago. She was meant to email me the shipping information for the day – PGP encrypted and from one Tormail account to another. There was an issue with her PGP and she failed to get it sorted and so, as it was late in the day and she didn&#039;t want to miss the shipment deadline, decided to send it another way that she believed was totally secure, but which was not (I do not want to give further detail on the forum as these may compromise things further). She also somehow mistakenly managed to send all the history rather than just the day&#039;s orders.<br /><br />3. Tormail was compromised shortly afterwards.<br /><br />The circumstances and the timing could not have been more horrifically aligned, and I consider the shipping information compromised. <br /><br />I take full personal responsibility for this. Whatever role my assistant played, I allowed it to happen. I am a professional and I have never been responsible for such a degree of fuck up in all my life, and I feel utterly gutted and destroyed from the betrayal of trust and care that I have just caused. I am deeply sorry to all of you.<br /><br />The data does link names and addresses to SR usernames but does not refer to any specific product. While I consider it low probability that there will be any direct follow-up, I do highly recommend that you clean house and do whatever else is required to protect yourself. I will also be sending this communication out by PM to all our clients.<br /><br />Our account itself was not compromised from the Javascript exploit and everything is functional and secure. And of course the learning from the most painful kind of lesson is already being applied. I have already shared the details of this with DPR and have offered to walk the plank - and may yet depending on how this plays out.<br /><br />Though I will never meet any of you in person, you are like a great family that I love and care for very much. And I have done the worst thing and compromised your safety. I am so sorry.<br /><br />BlueGiraffe (neck hung in shame)<br /><br /><br />

				I have long suspected that most vendors will probably keep a log of their clients&#039; usernames and IRL names and addresses.<br /><br />Respect to you BG for admitting it, but Jesus Christ, you have seriously fucked things up. I thank my lucky stars I didn&#039;t order from you - despite being quite tempted after reading your enthusiastic and well-informed sounding posts on GHB.

				And this is why I say: fuck RxKing and any vendor who refuses to take PGP encrypted messages.

				It&#039;s interesting that Googleeyed&#039;s minion was spraying names and addresses all over the forum a few months back and nothing happened to him (and I bet he&#039;s still using shippers and sending the addresses to them) and down the months others have admitted to keeping addresses and they seem to have been ok too, yet this happens to BlueGiraffe.<br /><br />It is serious but there seems to be an inconsistency here.<br /><br />I suppose the lesson to be learnt (as it is each time this kind of thing happens) is that if you&#039;re using a vendor that uses hired help to process the orders then you are going to be at a greater risk of disclosure, either deliberate or accidental.<br /><br />

				Does this mean that he cant continue as a vendor? I dont find his vendor page at least. I was also going to order him soon&nbsp; :&#039;(. Even though i havent made business with him yet, i find him very trustworthy and responsible. Especially after he now admits what has happened. The fact he kept the info of clients was probably a backdoor for him to keep business going even after something would happen to Silk Road. But of course i understand the policy of not doing so and it&#039;s for cases exactly like this. Hope he get&#039;s everything working - he doesn&#039;t deserve this.

				Man. Thanks for letting everyone know.<br /><br />And to the powers-that-be: Keeping those addresses was a mistake, but BG could just as easily have said nothing. Why punish or ban a vendor for coming clean? Won&#039;t that just discourage others from admitting mistakes? I know vendors are explicitly banned from saving addresses, and I get that rules are rules. It just seems dangerous to me to send the message that anyone trying to right a wrong or prevent fallout from their actions would be better off covering things up than coming clean.

This is a serious breach both on SR rules and both on customers security. Yes, BlueGiraffe has had a lot of dignity on admitting what happened but still this is a serious thing and you cannot pretend a SR admin to do nothing about it.<br /><br />Moreover I tell you this: this thing would have come to the surface one way or another, either if BlueGiraffe said nothing. In this way, by being honest, s/he will much probably be allowed to create another account and start anew with a new modus operandi, but if shit did hit the fan and s/he said nothing s/he would never been allowed to vend here no matter what and on top of that s/he would have much probably lost all his/her clients and respect because nobody would trust him/her anymore. In this way s/he did an error (and a big one at that) but by excusing and admitting it openly his/her dignity remains intact.<br /><br />So it&#039;s not that s/he is just getting a fist in the face for being honest; losing the vendor account is really the least of the repercussions here.

				BlueGiraffe, at least you had the common decency to come out and man up and say what you did.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry about my account if I were you.&nbsp; Just get a new one.<br /><br />Liston admitted to keeping his customer&#039;s addresses and threatened to give my info to LE after shipping a quantity of coke to me.&nbsp; I reported it to the Mods here and they helped me get in touch with admin on SR.&nbsp; He was banned and I was assured that he would never be back unless he could hide his identity.<br /><br />...three days later, he was back with the exact same profile, same PGP, same products, but added &quot;ishere&quot; to his name and became &quot;listonishere&quot;.<br /><br />I was assured that he would never be back unless he could hide the fact that it was him.&nbsp; He admitted to keeping addresses and his threats were in our messages.<br /><br />He did all this because he sent a package that I ordered from the US and he sent it from the UK.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t get it and filed a dispute.&nbsp; I won after 10 days because he gave up and gave me a 100 percent refund, but only because I quoted what a mod told me on here regarding his threats and listed quite a few violations of the seller&#039;s agreement that he signed up for.&nbsp; I told him that I got a seizure letter a couple weeks later and he called me a liar.&nbsp; After that, he simply threatened me through tormail for a few weeks until I told him that the box wasn&#039;t in my name and it would never be visited again so he could send all the shit he could afford and maybe some lucky sorter or PO employee could party for a few months on his dime.<br /><br />So, based on how SR handled the liston aka listonishere situation.&nbsp; I would think you would get a medal and not banned, since you were straight up and made a fuck up and admitted to it.<br /><br />So SR would probably prefer that you send messages and threaten to narc out all your customers after sending them illegal shit, get banned, then come back as &quot;BlueGiraffeishere&quot;.<br /><br />I encourage everyone to get a person you know, tell them that you owe the PO money for a box that they found was not paid for a year and now you can&#039;t open a box or some other bullshit story about why you can&#039;t open one.&nbsp; Tell them you have a warrant and can&#039;t show your ID because they cross reference it and would have you arrested.&nbsp; Buy a bum a bag of liquor...however you need to get it done, and just have a new one every three months.&nbsp; It costs a few bucks more, but I sleep better at night.&nbsp; They can&#039;t get in trouble.&nbsp; I just tell them if anyone, including LE, ever asks them about it, just tell them they opened it and had both keys on a separate ring and lost them and they wrote a letter to the PO and never heard back about the situation.<br /><br />Also, never get a year, or six months, if you have one like mine, they do 6 month leases but you can get a 50 percent refund after 3 months, show that to a stranger or friend and they may do it just to get an extra 30 bucks.&nbsp; Just bounce from one PO to another and keep your orders to a minimum.&nbsp; For some reason, it seems like every PO has different rates.&nbsp; Do one from Mailboxes etc., the UPS store, or some local businesses.&nbsp; You can even go to a cheap motel, pay for 3 or 4 days, tell them your wife kicked you out and ask if it is ok if&nbsp; your family mails you some personal stuff like copies of family photos, home videos, legal papers, bronzed baby shoes and so on, since your whore wife will just throw it away out of spite.&nbsp; Many men and women will not only understand, but sympathize with you.&nbsp; Leave, tell them you made up and are moving back in, then come back in a month with the same story.&nbsp; Tell them you will hook them up with a tip for helping you out.&nbsp; I even have ordered legit stuff for the first delivery to the hotel, just had a friend send an envelope with a die-cast car in it and immediately opened it in front of the clerk, handed him 20 bucks and told him it was not even worth the postage, but was from my grandfather right before he died when I was 12.&nbsp; I have 40+ orders and never had more than 5 arrive at any given location, never in my name, and never picked it up myself, except for the hotel ones.&nbsp; It seems like a huge hassle and expense, but facing a trial for a drug conspiracy and misusing the postal service to send illegal substances is more of a hassle and expense, at least I would think.<br /><br />I am joking about what you should do, but the liston deal was discussed on here, then he was banned and I am disheartened that SR would have taken his money and let a snitch return even though they were told and knew it.&nbsp; I think Libertas and Scout were taken back as well.&nbsp; I know Libertas assured me, in good faith, I am sure, that he would not be back unless he could hide who he was...too bad he isn&#039;t a silk road Admin because I don&#039;t think he can be bought off like that.&nbsp; But hey, I only had to burn a hundred dollar plus PO Box that wasn&#039;t even in my name after I just renewed it.&nbsp; The Bitch of it is that I couldn&#039;t get a refund, because I got it under a fake name.&nbsp; Even funnier, a family member at the PO let me open the box under a Narcotics Officer&#039;s name and home address.&nbsp; Would have been great to see how that played out.&nbsp; I just went and wiped the outside of the box with a rag and rubbing alcohol, just in case the joke was not well-received.&nbsp; Guess the joke was on me, liston, or maybe you since you lost your deposit and had to buy a new account.&nbsp; Keep dancing you queer ass snitch.&nbsp; Ok, mate!<br /><br />But as for you BlueGiraffe, way to man up.&nbsp; You made a mistake.&nbsp; I remember one time I made a mistake...it&#039;s ok.&nbsp; Everybody gets one.

				All though it is good that you have come clean, it does not make what you did any better. It is extremely irresponsible and careless for you to keep addresses, and your reason for doing so is not nearly good enough. If you did need to re-ship it is very simple for you to get the customers details again. In my opinion you have fucked up and you deserve to suffer from the consequences, you jeopardized peoples&nbsp; freedom and for that you don&#039;t deserve to have vending privileges.

In my view, the safest practice is when plaintext customer addresses never touch storage media. You decrypt them in your PGP app in RAM, you copy them over to your label printer software, and then they are discarded. You don&#039;t save them a text file. You don&#039;t transfer them on a thumb drive. You don&#039;t send them by email.<br /><br />I understand this is not ideal to certain workflows, but it is ideal from a customer safety perspective.<br />

Rather it was my habit of keeping details until confirmed delivery of an order in case there needed to be discussion around a re-ship. And then it was my intention to remove all name and address details but only keep country information so that I would then have useful stats. I did not get a chance to do that before the document was mistakenly leaked. Not condoning anything - just clarifying intention. <br /><br />And yes, right now he does deserve this. Pirate ships have to be run tightly - it&#039;s always been that way.<br /><br />BG<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for correcting me. I could try to give you advices, but i know i don&#039;t need to. If my information would have been in your hands when this happened, i couldn&#039;t bring myself to blame you. It doesn&#039;t mean i would give that privilege to every vendor, but i would have made exception with you and taken consequences. After all, it wasn&#039;t directly you who made the mistake and choices are made in both ways. Even coming here in first place is choice. Understanding that there is many, whom this is bigger problem, i just wanted to shortly give my personal input. You deal the situation the best way you see - i don&#039;t need to add anything to that. You have my support.

				The Reasonably Paranoid Post: <br /><br />1. BG being a top vendor, having thousands (?) of customers, whose names and usernames with addresses all linked, I believe this would be a major opportunity for INTER-LE to do a massive international crackdown on incriminated users and scare the shit out of everyone else by using the media to say that SR is compromised.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. Now that so many usernames and real names are tied, LE could easily multiple sexy vendor accounts and see every customer&#039;s stats and have that as evidence for all the orders users have made. <br /><br />3.&nbsp; This fucking sucks but thanks anyway BG for letting us know. <br /><br />Q: does this mean that we should close our accounts and have them deleted, or at least their history, by SR ?

				I&#039;m not a customer of BG&#039;s but I&#039;ve seen his presence around here. Obviously, keeping the buyer list and especially having it passed by an intern (or assistant) unencrypted ain&#039;t good. THAT being said.. I think people need to relax. A SR username with an address tied to it, with not date/time/order info... is NOT the end of the world. Nothing is going to happen to those people at all. Simply nothing. It proves nothing. Someone could have gone down the phonebook and pulled random names/addresses from allover the country and put random names from the SR forum next to them and created a document for no good reason.<br />And no, I&#039;m not being sarcastic/funny. There&#039;s no proof of anything. Out of the gazillion gigs of data seized (we don&#039;t even know if the Tormail emails were even seized or what&#039;s even going on), you think 1 list of addresses is going to justify a SWAT team kicking down every door on that list? No!<br /><br />BlueGiraffe seems to be a standup guy/vendor who immediately took ownership of this snafu. He/she didn&#039;t even need to bring this to the attention of DPR/SR/the forum.. nobody would ever be the wiser. I don&#039;t think he should loose his vendor privleges at all! Also, get real people.. every single vendor stores buyer information. And vendors, don&#039;t say &quot;well I DONT!&quot; because you most probably do.. it streamlines operations and even though it sucks, I think it&#039;s an understood. Not to scare people.. but I&#039;m sure other vendors have passed your information around unecrypted at some point too. <br /><br />Relax, nothing will happen. Everyone needs to be more security conscious with all this fuckery going on with Freedom Hosting etc, and that&#039;s about all we can do. Change your passwords, DON&#039;T talk/exchange anything unencrypted, and use common sense.

				Let&#039;s be honest... if you have ordered more than a few times on SR then you can assume that address (and likely product ordered) has already been sent by one of your vendors via TorMail.&nbsp; BG is probably one of the few actually admitting it.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how hard LE wants to crack down on users of SR specifically.&nbsp; With the focus of terrorists starting to wane they might start emphasizing crackdowns on drug users and buyers.&nbsp; Hopefully there is just so much info on TorMail that LE can only go for the big guys or can&#039;t even disseminate what&#039;s going on in the emails.&nbsp; Then again if they&#039;ve cracked down on TorMail and are going after the &quot;deep web&quot;, it&#039;s only a matter of time before they stumble on the behemoth that is the Silk Road.

				A few important questions:<br /><br />Did the spreadsheet contain metadata? If so you might be several degrees of even more fucked.<br />Did it contain tracking numbers? <br />We already know that LE records all mail covers in the US. It&#039;s safe to say that every one of your customers will now have their mail covers pulled and examined by an analyst (regardless of whether you kept the tracking numbers, but that&#039;d just make the analysis easier).<br /><br />Did you have in transit shipments? Have you notified those customers that the shipments are compromised by LE and could be CD&#039;d?<br /><br />

				If you &quot;punish&quot; this BlueGiraffe person by yoinking their account, the next time this happens the vendor won&#039;t say anything.<br /><br />Your label printers can snitch too, they are proprietary blackboxes who knows what kind of memory they keep or information that can be extracted from them. <br /><br />When I sold stuff I kept note of the amount and then packed everything separating for amounts. I then spawned a truecrypt container on a live CD running in ram only, and pasted the encrypted PGP from SR buyers into an empty text file inside the container and decrypted for immediate printer use. (printer ran in it&#039;s own VPN snapshot with no network access). The printer snapshot I kept on an Ironkey drive in a TC container. Afterwards I kept customer info until they received the goods then shred -fvzu -n 3 /home/user/container.txt and never wrote down &quot;1kg MDMA&quot; and instead used codewords. Prob not a foolproof setup but seemed to work. I JTAG attached to my printer and was trying to figure out how to clear flash memory and reverse engineer to see what was going on then got out of the game and destroyed everything. Maybe for lulz I&#039;ll buy some more Amazon cheap label printers and see what kind of info they keep around.

An example? Infinitesource; now compare that to &quot;losing a vendor account&quot; and which is worse.<br /><br />Do you REALLY think a vendor can seriously &quot;keep his mouth shout about keeping addresses&quot; so that it will NEVER come out? If you think so then you have a point, but luckily it is not so.<br /><br />And apart this let me understand, what would you want SR admin to do? To just say: &quot;oh well, since you said that you kept addresses we will just let the thing pass&quot;? Great, now a vendor has just to talk about the rules s/he breaks and nothing will ever come out of it just because the vendor has been &quot;honest&quot;; is this what you want?<br /><br />Having honor and dignity is NOT a virtue or something you are an hero because of it, it is how things HAVE TO AND MUST be. If you do admit you fucked up (and especially if your client security is at danger) it&#039;s not that you need a medal because you admitted it and prevented trouble to your clients, you just did what you HAD to do and if you didn&#039;t you were a piece of shit. Those that don&#039;t do it just for a sort of temporary self-preservation simply have no honor no dignity and people sooner or later will understand it and then they will be fucked up, but seriously and forever; losing account privileges it&#039;s nothing in comparison to something like that.

				I don&#039;t think there should be any further punishment whatsoever If something happens to his clients or to himself this is already a punishment, (which is really unlikely considering this is only a list of names and addresses, there is much more detailed information about transactions, shipping methods etc on tormail if LE wants some action they will get it, this only the tip of the iceberg). Punishing BG punishes mostly his clients and has no effect on BG because he can start vending with a new account. Only thing we can do is to learn something from the situation&nbsp; - mainly that the rules of SR are meant to protect us all and must be always followed and by everyone, however meaningless or hard it might seem, this is the only way to keep the ship tight and running. I hope everybody learned&nbsp; something today GL and thanks for keeping us updated.

				Also, I guess I&#039;d like to add that it&#039;s not TOTALLY surprising that the Giraffe felt it necessary to guard against buyer scams and/or to be more efficient, (because vendors&#039; feedback is based in part on shipping speed).&nbsp; It obviously wasn&#039;t the best of all possible ways, but when you look at the newly-implemented way way back buyer stats (which I find ridiculous) and the number of vendors saying things like &quot;Oh hell no, I don&#039;t dare work with anybody who&#039;s not on my level,&quot; you can start to understand that the vendors are all running around scared to death of being scammed.&nbsp; If this was Blue&#039;s way of dealing with that fear, well, then, it sucks; but I get it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other fallout from this scandal is that now all kinds of people may be tempted to put in less-than-legit addresses.&nbsp; Let&#039;s be honest, the best way for your stuff to arrive safely in your hands is to have it sent to an address you&#039;ve been receiving mail at for a while (or at least a bit).&nbsp; PGP encryption, stealthing of packages, the fact that (in the US at least) the post can&#039;t open anything without a warrant, the lack of proof of intention on the part of the recipient ... all of these are layers of defense insulating the human being at the end of the line.&nbsp; So it should work beautifully.&nbsp; Except now, we&#039;ve all got our pants in a bunch; and I hope that all sorts of great things don&#039;t miss their intended targets because we, in fear, try to outsmart the very good system.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ***footnote to that point:&nbsp; There is a story of a young man in New York who stored a lot of MDMA in a storage facility.&nbsp; Which would have been no problem, except he rented that storage unit with a false i.d.&nbsp; The facility sent a bill or something to the person&#039;s address that appeared on the i.d., and from there, things got fucked.&nbsp; It went something like this.&nbsp; That person contacted the facility saying he didn&#039;t have anything there, the facility got suspicious, the police got involved, the unit got raided, they found a bunch of pills, the police then waited for the guys to show up to pick up some or all of those pills, and one of the heroes (the E dealers) ended up panicking in jail and killing himself, in part because NY State has got some of the most draconian laws against consciousness-altering substances of which they do not approve.&nbsp; Let this tragedy not be in vain.&nbsp; My heart goes out to that kid, his partner, and their families; and here we see prohibition and the State implicated in yet another needless, horrible death.&nbsp; But let&#039;s remember: you can out-smart yourself.***<br /><br />I guess it comes down to fear.&nbsp; We do tend toward a lot of freaking out here --over our legality, money, reputation-- and I could see how some of us could do stupid stuff, like keep all our addresses in case of reship, out of that ever-present anxiety.<br /><br />But fear is the mind-killer.&nbsp; We&#039;ve got to keep it together here, brothers and sisters!&nbsp; There are many ways to do it right, but let&#039;s do it right!

I think most people here know what happened to Tormail or Freedom Hosting.<br /><br />I appreciate BlueGiraffe as a very honest vendor, thumbs-up for this.

				Not to make light of the situation, but I feel this is a salient point to make: GHB is Schedule IV in the US and class C in the UK. Aren&#039;t there going to be more interesting TorMail accounts to be trawling through, like someone selling Schedule I or Class A substances in large amounts? I would imagine US LE are more interested in stopping large amounts of Schedule I substances from crossing into their jurisdiction, especially since a Schedule I bust would gain them more brownie points. Just a thought.

In Bruce&#039;s case the guy was not a client or customer he sent his address unsolicited after blatantly scamming in the forums.&nbsp; AS for Blue Giraffe it&#039;s a different story entirely, s/he seems like a decent person but keeping a huge database of all-time customer addresses, well, it scares the living shit out of me. That said, you know what they say- act in haste, repent at leisure. Yes s/he manned up &amp; admitted it both to DPR internally and here and I have no idea what emotional turmoil BG&#039;s going through right now but they should not be allowed to keep selling. It&#039;s a monumental abuse of trust and endangering SR customers&#039; security in that way can and should not be overlooked. But hugs to BG and their customers.

				Huge props for admitting your mistake, BlueGiraffe.&nbsp; But you really really did fuck up.&nbsp; There is absolutely no reason you should have kept that data, encrypted or not.&nbsp; Pure fail.&nbsp; You obviously know that tho, and are taking every step to repair any damage you may have done.&nbsp; That is great to see - many certainly would have just kept their mouths shut.<br /><br />I am sorry this happened, but BG made his own bed, and unfortunately its his customers that now have to lay in it.

				Quick overview shows most of the major text editing packages (word, openoffice) have at least attempted to implement symmetric encryption for password protected documents. Word uses RC4-128, in 2005 it had a seriously broken implementation but it looks like the flaw wouldn&#039;t have an effect in this specific case since it requires at least two different versions of the same encrypted file (there are probably other problems with their implementation but this is the big one). Open Office uses Blowfish-128 and looks like it was properly implemented as far as I can tell. In both cases I just did a quick glance. The thing to take from this though is that although it is horribly worse than using GPG, a password protected text document might not be the end of the world. The thing to ask now is, was the password exchange secure, and was the password highly entropic? If the password exchange was done securely and the password was strong, I would bring my concern level down from 10 to 5, now that I know it was in a password protected document at least. If she put it in an Open Office document and used a 128 bit password that she shared with you face to face, it seems unlikely that the feds can ever decrypt it even if they seize it.&nbsp; Looks like Libre Office uses AES-256, but it is a bit harder to find info for the open source ones (Microsoft Word is easy to find info for since it seems it has been attacked and defeated a few times, in specific circumstances).<br /><br />In the case of Libre Office especially, followed by Open Office, followed by Microsoft Word, it is possible that the symmetric encryption is about on par with that used by GPG. But GPG does a few things besides symmetric encryption. For one it generates a truly random session key that is entropic enough to realize the maximum potential of the symmetric algorithm, and for two it uses RSA to secure encrypt the session key while it is in transit. So if we assume that whatever text editing program used actually has a good implementation of whatever symmetric algorithm it uses for data encryption, then the security falls to the two other things that GPG provides. So, if the password was really entropic then it could be close to the randomly generated GPG session key (unlikely that it is but it could be, it could even be just as entropic), and the exchange of the password. If she sent the password with the document then obviously it is fucked. If she used GPG to send you the password then actually the transfer of the session key (password) will have equal security to a regular GPG session key transfer, and if she used OTR the security will be that of OTR. If she told it to you face to face it is better yet. Assuming we are lucky and the text editing program uses a good implementation of its symmetric algorithm, and she sent you the password in a secure way, then the security is that of the password used to encrypt the document, hopefully it is at the very minimum 80 bits (over 100 would be better). If the heavens are smiling upon your customers, the feds may be able to obtain the document and not decrypt it. It looks like at least Libre uses a PBKDF with some iterations, so should stretch the password strength out a little.

				I really respect you for admitting this. I would order from you again if you don&#039;t keep any of my information. It would be really anti-libertarian for DPR to ban you for something like this because it&#039;s not like you&#039;re a scammer or something and if people decide that they are going to order from you again, it is their decision, not anyone else&#039;s. There really aren&#039;t any other vendors with GHB even close to the quality you have, so I&#039;d really hate to see you go.<br /><br />Do you still have the document stored somewhere? You should probably overwrite it with DOD or something if it&#039;s on a hard drive. CCleaner can do it if you add it to the included files list and then go to settings and choose secure deletion. I think a good way to keep everything pretty safe would be to install a virtual machine and put the virtual hard drive file on a fast USB 3 flash drive. Then install a minimalist OS like even windows XP on the VM along with Tor, PGP, etc. Then if there is ever a problem, none of that shit has ever touched your hard drive, so if you need to you can just burn the USB and keep your computer as if nothing was ever installed on it.<br /><br />At least you said it was a password protected document. That&#039;s much better that just in the email or attachment like I originally thought.

				So I read about the program used, it is far from ideal, uses an old symmetric algorithm that has some known weaknesses but none of them seem to break it in common usage yet. It looks like it is a dying symmetric algorithm that will probably be broken in more practical situations some time in the fairly near future. It is already broken in specific edge case scenarios but I don&#039;t think from my quick glance over it that this situation will be one of those. So pretty much not a symmetric cipher that you want to use, had problems yesterday, has a lot more today and will probably have a lot lot more tomorrow, but it is not ROT-13 or something and can still probably provide some level of security if it is properly implemented.<br /><br />The second issue is that the security it can provide is very implementation dependent. It seems like it needs to be extremely carefully implemented to avoid it being easily crackable, and there are many systems using this algorithm that have implemented it incorrectly such that they are quickly crackable. As far as this particular text editing program goes, I have no idea if they implemented it properly, I can find very little information about this editor as it is quite obscure. I would lean toward thinking that they probably fucked it up just to be on the safe side, but it is possible they implemented it correctly.<br /><br />The third issue is that they limit the password size to such a low number of characters and such a small selection of characters that without a PBKDF (which I cannot find if they use) the very most entropy the password is going to have will be just under 100 bits, but that assumes that the password is actually randomly generated and not some words or something human created. <br /><br />All of these things together paint a pretty bleak picture, but not as bad as no encryption at all being used. It is possible still that the heavens will smile on your customers, and the symmetric algorithm has just enough life left in it to be strong enough in this scenario, it was implemented properly by the people who made the text editing program and the password was pseudorandomly generated or very close to random and human created, and hopefully there is a PBKDF as well to give it a bit more strength. But honestly I wouldn&#039;t get my hopes up very high.

So what would you do? You do nothing because some will be naturally &quot;forced&quot; to accept a decision that&#039;s not theirs? Will it be &quot;anti-Libertarian&quot; if someone decides to do something you don&#039;t like in a context that doesn&#039;t pertain only to yourself? Stop pretending you are the center of the universe and your opinion is the only one that matters and then maybe you will be able to see how idiotic what you say is in this circumstance.<br /><br />If you really cannot accept somebody to take a decision that you don&#039;t like then simply don&#039;t join a community where this will obviously happen no matter what. A community is not YOU, do you understand this, do you? You can do what you want of yourself and what it concern only yourself, but things change dramatically when the point of view enlarges.

				Well I&#039;ll have a look through your post&#039;s and see if I agree.<br /><br />No, but castigating a member on a thread started as an important announcement, sort of detracts from the purpose don&#039;t you think. I think BG needs to hear positive things now rather than you contradicting someone by pointing out BG agreed to the rules. I think he knows full well he agreed, but how is that helping. If we can&#039;t offer constructive criticism, than why should we comment?<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to be obtuse or offensive.

I mean what having people that trusted you losing liberty is in comparison to this?) then you can rest assured that you have done or will do even worse because you are an absolute piece of shit and a disgrace to this place.<br /><br />Is not certainly just because SR admins banned a vendor that talked about an error committed that will make a vendor that can be really addressed with that name shut up in case of a security risk of his/her clients (because a vendor that can really be called such respect the trust put in him/herself and will never willingly disgrace that trust if s/he can avoid it), and in the same way it will certainly not be the no-ban to another vendor that you would turn a piece of shit in an individual with some dignity and that cares for his/her clients; a person like that cares only about him/herself, s/he will do the exact same thing with or without an incentive.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=196608.msg1427369#msg1427369">Quote from: Purpletown on August 08, 2013, 03:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">However, the full disclosure shows integrity. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, it does.

				no matter how much you say your sorry this is still against policy and you should never keep a file of address to houses you have shipped to whether its encrypted or not. what would you do with those address&#039;s after your finsiehd bussiness with them ? maybe you or someone connected with you is selling those address to the RC people in china who send random letters to random ship address asking for business. which is bullshit,.. you dont know where its going whos house, or who lives there. could end up wrong the person who was suposed to have his contact info deleted RIGHT after it was copied or written down. sorry but i dont agree with how that was done. you people should have known better and this even got you published in a wired or some sort of website article with your name specificaly used because this happened.&nbsp; ;D dont pay people so much if they dont know whats up. i would never pay someone to take care of something in &quot;my name&quot; unless they have started it with me or they have been taught and know. sorry for the novel lol

				yes very stupid but like i said have you ever heard of buyers from a seller getting random mail in the letter a few months/maybe weeks later for no reason talking about RC chemicals and all that from china. they have to get those address from somewhere you know what im saying ? some vendor is giving or selling probablly selling information like that very cheap to another vendor to get more sales. i could be paranoid and i prolly am but its just a thought that came to mind. why would you want or need to keep address after youve done bussiness with them&nbsp; ?? it does not make sense at all unless you supsect a scammer but then why would you have a whole pdf file full of addresses. the clearnet link or some link i seen said anyone who bought gbl or ghl of him should be under concerne no matter what because it could be in the wrong hands with LE because it wasnt encyrpyed. who honestly hires someone that dumb to take off your work. this gets to me lol

There is nothing I can say or do to excuse what I did nor make it right. The potential consequence to each of my client&#039;s safety (and actual consequence to their state of mind) is real and I know it, and I will have to live with the karma of that fuck-up.<br /><br />But, there&#039;s not more to this than I&#039;m telling you. It is as I&#039;ve described it. The addresses were kept initially for verifying re-ships. We had an unconditional re-ship guarantee and I felt it prudent to keep this on hand until the order had been confirmed delivered. It would allow me to verify if the address had been given correctly in the first place, and also deal with any questions that might come up while the order was &quot;open&quot; (I often split orders across multiple addresses, people ordered to one of many different drops they had, and often enough I was asked to confirm what was coming where as the buyer had forgotten). In retrospect it&#039;s clear, that weighed against the risk, it was not right to keep the details. Furthermore I intended to harvest the &quot;volume by country&quot; stats for my own interest and delete the personally identifiable detail subsequently. I did not get around to that. <br /><br />I also addressed the detail of how it happened here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=198845.msg1431124#msg1431124<br /><br />None of this is excuse or defense or justification. I know I fucked up, and were my identity known, I know I likely would be fucked up. And it would be fair.<br /><br />I&#039;m responding to this for one reason only, and that is to at least let everyone know that things are not as twisted as the suspicion in your post suggests. I see there is a gathering conversation expressing concerns about vendors being dodgy in one way or another. I made a grave error of judgement, but there was nothing underhanded going on. For what it&#039;s worth...<br /><br />And for what it&#039;s worth Koonta, I&#039;m sorry. Your anger is justified, and for my soul, I&#039;m trying to eat it all. Yours and everyone else&#039;s.<br /><br />BG

				I started a thread just over a month ago after i made a purchase off BG by mistake because i didn&#039;t realize my domestic filter was off.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ended up getting a letter from Homeland security inside the package.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178433.0<br /><br />I never mentioned in that thread it was from him because I figured the package got busted by chance since he had such a good rating and history on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;He offered to reship and I eventually took him up on it and he asked for my address again.&nbsp; I had used my usual address but on the reship I decided to send him another address to be cautious.&nbsp; The package did arrive successfully but regardless that was going to be the last time I ever ordered from him.&nbsp; I told him that it was a mistake to begin with because i never order from overseas.<br /><br />I received 2 PMs from him about the tormail issue.&nbsp; I assume I got one for each address he had for me even though they were both related to the same account.&nbsp; <br /><br />All things considered I&#039;m pretty pissed that any of my addresses were saved when I made it very clear I never meant to even order from him.&nbsp; The homeland security letter is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />

Vendors, even (especially) good ones, with fast shipping/great stealth/great product, work hard on their reputations; if faced with the choice of losing both that and their money in one fell swoop to &quot;do the right thing&quot; versus saying &quot;fuck it, let&#039;s roll with it, if they do get that data nobody will ever know it&#039;s me.&quot;&nbsp; I am skeptical.&nbsp; People kill each other over money.&nbsp; Family members hate each other over money.&nbsp; People steal for money.&nbsp; Bankers cripple entire national economies knowingly for the money.&nbsp; People do this every day, in real life, to people they know.<br /><br />Are they pieces of shit?&nbsp; Maybe, but it happens every day.&nbsp; So to think that it&#039;s just the norm for somebody to come clean in this situation seems to me to be naiive.&nbsp; It sucks for his customers, but at least people have a chance to clean house and prepare for the worst.<br /><br />Everybody always says &quot;never FE even if they have great reviews.&quot;&nbsp; Well, people who don&#039;t deliver on FE are pieces of shit, right?&nbsp; How often does it happen?&nbsp; More often than it should?&nbsp; &nbsp;But how many reviews do you see that say &quot;FE 5/5&quot;?&nbsp; Tons and tons.&nbsp; And the vendor that stiffs has his 5*, and the buyer is fucked.&nbsp; Sure, they can take it to the forums or /r/SilkRoad, but most people will still just see VENDORNAME(99) and buy anyway and many of them will FE like the last guy.&nbsp; Are those people dumb?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But there&#039;s no popup message that says DO NOT FINALIZE UNLESS YOU HAVE RECEIVED YOUR SHIPMENT.&nbsp; IF THE VENDOR TELLS YOU THIS IS REQUIRED YOU SHOULD FIND ANOTHER VENDOR.&nbsp; The system itself has no clear disincentive for fraud (except of course for escrow but my point is the only place FE is actively discouraged is on the forums and not in the actual SR UI).<br /><br />My point:&nbsp; it&#039;s an amazing, unprecedented, awesome thing, this market.&nbsp; It&#039;s also got its share of fraud and dishonest people, and there is no real punishment for those people if they persist in their behavior unless they&#039;re especially blatant - and even then they get the EXACT SAME PUNISHMENT BG GOT.&nbsp; It&#039;s Tor.&nbsp; They can spin up a new vendor account, and DPR himself wouldn&#039;t know.&nbsp; So to see somebody step up publicly and take their lumps, cut off their revenue, and actively participate in the mitigation of the problem, solely based on their concern for people who could never identify them, that they will never meet, is commendable.<br /><br />TL;DR: I respectfully disagree with you and think that many people would not have done what BG did in this situation.&nbsp;

				Yes, RaFael5 - although lists should not be kept under any circumstances, had everything been encrypted, including the customer list and the email communication between sender and recipient, although against the rules, there would not have been an issue that would compromise users.<br /><br />I believe this is the tip of the iceberg. Many vendors are doing this and simply don&#039;t acknowledge it. I recently made two separate orders to the same vendor, days apart, to two separate names and delivery addresses - but both orders went to the recipient on the first order. The vendor assumed because both orders were from the same user, that they should both have been the same name &amp; address. However, what it also proved, was that the vendor is keeping usernames, with associated names and addresses, otherwise the shipment error could not have occurred. It is very worrying that vendors are continuing this practice.

Many vendors are doing this and simply don&#039;t acknowledge it. I recently made two separate orders to the same vendor, days apart, to two separate names and delivery addresses - but both orders went to the recipient on the first order. The vendor assumed because both orders were from the same user, that they should both have been the same name &amp; address. However, what it also proved, was that the vendor is keeping usernames, with associated names and addresses, otherwise the shipment error could not have occurred. It is very worrying that vendors are continuing this practice.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Similar has happened to me <br />and I agree with you, Leukart,<br />but I thought this thread was about BG&#039;s mess-up... <br />maybe a good idea to start a general topic about this problem?
