				Hi all!<br /><br />I&#039;m a vendor, and i have a dilemma.&nbsp; Return customers are the lifeblood of any business.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to know who my return customers are, but for security reasons, I really don&#039;t want to keep a written record of who buys from me.&nbsp; I&#039;d be interested in knowing how other people handle this problem.

				Hi <br /><br />We have recently thought about this and decided the best way was to give first customers a Gift code (5% off for life) <br /><br />This way you will know that they are return customers. I guess it isn&#039;t exactly the best way to do it for the reason you have stated unless you can give out Gift codes that have no discount <br /><br />just a way of establishing Return customers would be good <br />I agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ll see if I can create a Gift code with no discount and Let you know.<br /><br />Best Regards<br />WWProvider&#039;s

				Assign each customer a unique pass phrase which they should memorize and delete.&nbsp; Each time they order, they reference the pass phrase.&nbsp; For added protection, store you user list in an encrypted file.&nbsp; Pass phrases could be colors, or names of bands, or anything easy to remember.

				I do it via photographic memory, but if you do not posses one of those then I do not see why you couldnt keep a txt file of SR usernames ONLY!!! providing you have an understanding of TrueCrypt hidden volumes and usb sticks ETC.<br />

				Going along with Shroomeister&#039;s idea of &quot;a txt file of SR usernames ONLY!!!&quot;<br /><br />What if you encrypt their name with a one way hashing algorithm? MD5 and SHA2 come to mind. Then you&#039;d have a text file of random letters and numbers. Each time a customer orders, simply hash the name and check against the list.

				I have a half photographic memory.<br /><br />I remember the first half of their names.<br /><br />So far so good, No one has appeared with someone else&#039;s half.<br /><br />Putting the first hafl in an encrypted file should do the trick. The odds are slim that you&#039;d have a duplicate. SR has some creative folks picking their names.<br /><br /><br />BTW the other half of my memory is pornographic.<br /><br />

				Yeah, like Shroom and wizdom, I&#039;ve found it pretty easy to remember users that have bought before just from username / address recognition. It really doesn&#039;t seem that difficult. I might occasionally not notice a second-time buyer, but if it gets beyond twice, I&#039;ll definitely remember, and I think most people would.<br /><br />And people have already answered with other, more precise methods, so... What I want to know: What do you need the info for? Throwing a bit extra to those awesome customers I&#039;m guessing / assuming!? :)

				Not a vendor, but I like to send a thank you message to the vendor for the service every time I use them again. Usually gets a laugh, I like to think it helps them remember me.

				We didn&#039;t&nbsp; have a problem remembering all the names when we were only getting 12 orders a week either!&nbsp; &nbsp;But once we hit 15,&nbsp; it was all over! Lol!&nbsp; But yes, vendors do appreciate a little love when the orders come in, &amp; sometimes it even works in the customers favor.<br /><br /><br />NCK
