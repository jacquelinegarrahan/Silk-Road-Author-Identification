				DPR got caught on purpose because he knew he would be found not guilty. All of this is according to plan so&nbsp; that he can legally begin using his eighty million dollars. Once he is found not guilty, he will be able to spend his money.

				If hes found not guilty, that means they can&#039;t prove hes DPR. That means he shouldnt have 80 mil, right? Nope - you can&#039;t be charged for the same crime twice. Double jeopardy.<br /><br />Everything is going according to plan.<br /><br />In the next few months, DPR will be found not guilty because they won&#039;t be able to prove he is guilty because TOR is untraceable, and he will be spending his 80 million dollars.<br /><br />He saw all of this coming.

				That&#039;s why the media is reporting he has a smirk on his face in court.<br /><br />He knows he is going to be walking a free man and living a life of luxury - legally.

				Out of all the stupid shit written in the last few days...and there was A LOT!<br /><br />This is probably the stupidest.<br /><br />Also, you need to stop getting your facts from Hollywood movies. You need to learn what Double Jeopardy is.<br /><br />Clearly you are a wreck and also just not that smart a guy. <br /><br />Realize they didn&#039;t seize 80 million from him. In fact, it never talks about his personal accounts or his assets. It does talk about a DPR account having 3 million in it on Silk Road and that they seized.<br /><br />He didn&#039;t see shit coming.

				LOL!!! that was funny....... sorry to burst your bubble OP but he was just a careless kid that left his laptop on and wasn&#039;t smart enough to be running a live system that can be aborted with a quick pull of a device. It was DPR&#039;s fault and his fault only and his stupidity and carelessness of others/himself with OUR security. He has no one to blame but HIMSELF

				Among all the other mistakes he broke another important rule of trade craft. Secure your environment before you do something sensitive. He got trolled. <br /><br />He was in a public library where he could not authenticate any of the other people allowed to be near him, he was chatting in real time with unknown people proving his laptop was unlocked and he did not have a workable plan to destruct the running keys.<br /><br />Remember this not Hans ordering a ounce weed for use at home. This is top target of multi national country LE.<br /><br />Anytime he log into admin should be in a locked secure room more then 20 feet away from any wall or access area, have a live system with encrypted usb tied to his neck that auto wipes and shut down on removal.<br /><br />They will create a scenario to have you break security protocol to get you. But in end security protocol can only be broke on YOU doing. DO NOT BE TROLLED. <br /><br />.

				Well, he may have not done this in purpose. But they are going to have to prove that he was the actual person typing the keyboard. Could of been anybody. Who know who may have had access to his account ????

				i was just a small time buyer, so i only went as far as tor and pgp encryption. If I was an uber 80 million dollar druglord though, I probably would have taken the effort to learn some of these more elaborate security measures i read about here on the forums. tsk tsk DPR. Let&#039;s keep in mind that despite all of his foolish errors, it still took the american governments like two years to arrest him and shut down Silk Road. If the next big black market web owner is even just a LITTLE more careful than DPR was, we are in for a long prosperous era of personal freedom<br /><br /><br />If ullrich was in fact the one and only Dread Pirate Roberts, however, I still respect the mans intellect. It would seem that he was much more knowledgeable in technology, rather than street smarts, unfortunately...

				The elaborate security measures some post about are not much concern for small time buyers of course. Bigger target = bigger security.<br /><br />DPR should sit in middle of airplane hangar size warehouse with bunker concrete walls with fold table and chair and laptop to admin SR. :D
