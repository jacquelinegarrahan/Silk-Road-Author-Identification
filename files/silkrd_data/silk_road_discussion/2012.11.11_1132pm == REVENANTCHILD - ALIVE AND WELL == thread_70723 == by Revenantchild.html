				A message to all my customers: <br />As you may have noticed, there has been a huge problem logging into Silk Road. Some of you may have been able to log in over the last couple of days and think that i am neglecting you. This is not the case. I have been unable to log into my own site since Friday - apparently SR is down in certain areas for server maintenance. Let me assure you that all orders placed up until Friday have been dispatched - even though i may have not confirmed them. I have not even been able to get onto the forums until now. Orders that are just hanging - please do not cancel. I will attend as soon as I can log back in. Please accept my humble apologies. I will be at your service as soon as SR is back up and running. <br /><br />Regards, <br />Revenantchild.

				Thanks for the vote of confidence guys... <br />I&#039;m sitting here in front of my keyboard patiently waiting for SR to come back up... <br />Hang in there - I&#039;ve managed to get a ton (well, a kilo or two) of weed and the minute we&#039;re up and running on all cylinders, I&#039;ll have the post office jumping around with your goodies... Truth is: I&#039;m, dreading the mountain of messages I&#039;m going to have to read through.. On the up side, through the efforts of the Dreaded Pirate, we may have a faster, more efficient SR at our fingertips..!

				Thanks for the update Revenantchild, will hold off on any new orders as you (and other respected sellers) will have a flood of orders when SR goes back up.
