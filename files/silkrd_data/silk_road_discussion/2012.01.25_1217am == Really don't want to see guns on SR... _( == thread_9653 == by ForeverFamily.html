				I could do without guns and a few other items but how much can we dictate the direction of an agorist community. Sure there are alternatives but none with all the perks of SR. Perhaps for some, certainly not all. Maybe a new community with a different ideology will rise, using a similar platform which SR has modeled so well. Who is to say?

				Unfortunately it would be strange to ban guns on SR. Once we start with guns, whats next? Banning is bad. Hopefully no one buys any of the guns and the demand will cease so there is no point to sell guns.&nbsp;

				I am a staunch supporter of the free market and for that matter free society. Having these values means that I must accept people to be self-governing, that my beliefs are not necessarily those that are shared by the people around me. Unfortunately, that means that I also have to accept that there are people in the world that would choose to harm me or worse yet, choose to harm children if given the opportunity.<br /><br />The fact is, restricting people from things (drugs, alcohol, weapons, child pornography) never really results in positive social changes, what&#039;s required is a revolution of the mind, for everyone to stay to themselves &quot;regardless of availability or profit, I choose not to buy/sell/view/do things that may cause harm to another&quot;.<br /><br />Perhaps we shouldn&#039;t regard SR as the poster child for agorism or free market, rather we should just think of it as the cool little club where we come to hang out, chat shit, buy drugs and peace out. If that&#039;s the case we could happily remove weapons without seeming oppressive or hypocritical. Happy days. /end rant

				I totally agree that we should not ban guns on SR. That would go against what everyone on here stands for. That being said, for the small part of SR that guns will make up in comparison to drugs, what 99.9% of us are here for, I think people should think of the majority, and not do something that may ultimately lead to the demise of what we all love and support so very much. I know in the end greed and selfishness will win out, but I&#039;d like to think in a rare community like this, people would have the decency to respect the majority. In my mind, this is a peaceful community of people just trying to be free, and do what they want without scrutiny, and as soon as you put guns in the mix, no matter what, it turns this place into a haven for supporting terrorism to anyone who doesn&#039;t know better, and the ABC&#039;s will have no choice but to make it a priority to take this place down. Just my .02 BTC worth

				The guns are what make this site an agorist community. As long as you aren&#039;t harming anyone and are engaging in voluntary exchange, then there can be no restrictions placed on that activity. I can&#039;t say what has already been said on this thread any better, especially blueangel and others, but I will add one thing. Guns are tools, just like a hammer. Both can be used for good or ill. In fact guns are the great equalizer and have saved many lives. Are we going to ban hammers? &quot;God made all men. Samuel Colt made all men equal.&quot; Keep the guns!!! If you don&#039;t like them don&#039;t buy one!

				guns aren&#039;t going to &quot;end&quot; SR. the feds figuring out who runs this place will end SR.<br /><br />here&#039;s the deal. i believe it everyone&#039;s right to own a gun. some of us are fortunate enough to live in countries where we can legally obtain one and have a legitimate use for it (protecting ourselves and the ones we love).<br /><br />those who seek out to do harm are going to do harm with our without a high-velocity shaped soft-metal projectile. There are countries who ban guns so that the only the police/military and the criminal have them - quelling the population into a state of fear and non-rebellion.<br /><br />I seriously think this is the path the US is headed...just give us another 20 years.<br /><br />I believe in freedom. Freedom to protect myself from those who would do me harm. I can legitimately order a .40cal semi-auto pistol because I live in a country where the laws haven&#039;t subjected me to dis-ownership.<br /><br />Please remember that not everyone is going to use a gun to kill someone, at least, someone who isn&#039;t trying to kill, harm or take what is not theirs.

And to all the people that say guns would be the catalyst for the end of Silk Road, you need to review the federal budget and focus on money spent by the government to control drugs as compared to the money allocated for controlling guns.&nbsp; Guns are a big issue for some people in government but drugs are a huge issue for many more people in the government. Much more time and effort is spent combating drugs than trying to prevent criminals from owning/selling/distributing guns. For all the press Silk Road has got I just keep seeing drugs in bold letters and on the headline of the story. While guns are usually not even mentioned and when they are it isnt to the extent that drugs are mentioned.<br /><br />Pissy liberals that have a problem with guns should go hang out in countries were the government doesnt allow citizens to be armed. Every citizen that has not been definitively proven to of committed a serious offense and is mentally stable should own a gun. I fear the government far more then I fear an armed citizen or even an armed criminal for that matter.<br /><br />And for you people that say there are many other places we can buy guns so they shouldn&#039;t be sold on Silk Road I say there are many other places you can buy drugs so they shouldnt be sold on Silk Road. Do you understand how flawed that logic is?<br /><br />Just say the truth, that the real reason you dont want guns on Silk Road is because they arnt something YOU buy so you dont care about them being sold here. Each one of you liberals will change your tune if you become the victim of a crime that could of been prevented had you been armed. <br /><br />The US gov spends so much more money on LE for drugs than guns that its safe to say that any1 making these anti-gun statements must be a drug user because you gotta be high not to realize the low priority people selling guns are compared to the people selling drugs.

But SR is a global community and attracts global media interest. If gun availability and interest increases on SR, I can guarantee that certainly from a UK/EU perspective, gun sales would be the headline.<br /><br />I can only hope there is limited interest. Otherwise, it&#039;s just another route of attack against SR. People interested in getting a quick personal fix is one thing, buying a gun is a complete new ball game.<br /><br />

				In this life, some things are absolute. Some things are relative. Wisdom is knowing which are which.<br /><br />Killing people is never &#039;always wrong&#039;. It usually goes against our instincts as a general principal we dislike the entire subject (whilst being weirdly fascinated by it in horror novels/films and murder/forensic mysteries).<br /><br />However we have been killing each other ever since we existed. Hence to say that &#039;killing is unnatural&#039; is idiocy. Doesn&#039;t fit the facts.<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t mean indiscriminate violence is to be approved of. But it does mean that having a absolutist morality about murder is absurd. <br />There are clearly many situations in which killing people is entirely appropriate. I didn&#039;t shed many tears which Osama Bin Laden died because his plot to kill 3000 odd people who were regular civilians was wrong. So fuck that guy.<br /><br />On the other hand, if Osama Bin Laden killed 3000 soldiers, then that is not wrong in the same way. Soldiers have signed up for that risk. They know they are targets of killers and are prepared for it. In some sense, this is fair. I&#039;m not advocating killing soldiers here, I don&#039;t like war because it frequently disrupts social and economic progress for the worse.&nbsp; I&#039;m saying playing the game by the rules is completely different to mass indiscriminate slaughter of civilians for their nationality, ethnicity, belief system etc.<br /><br />You takes your ticket and you takes your chances. You shouldn&#039;t hurt 3rd parties to weaken the enemy because that is cowardly. It&#039;s a basic principal of justice i.e. one should not punish the son for the sins of his father.<br /><br />Killing the enemy on the other hand, is always legitimate when they are seeking your demise.<br /><br />So, in response to the Gun Question. It depends.

				100% American nailed it. Let me get this straight, FF.... So guns, inanimate objects which have no potential for addiction, are bad. But drugs, which cause untold levels of suffering through addiction and the destruction of babies in utero and the collapse of the family unit, are good? The level of hypocrisy it takes to make an assertion like that is astounding. This site is about FREEDOM. Whatever floats your boat without sinking mine. That&#039;s what it&#039;s all about. Personal choice! If we were to start making rules and banning things then there is literally no end to it. Next it will be ban the porno, then ban the smack but coke is ok. You are opening a serious can of worms with your own mental hang ups. I don&#039;t think FF and others are proper agorists or libertarian anarchists. This isn&#039;t the site for you guys.

				Exactly, this is a free market. It should and must remain free. If you stick up for drug sales, you MUST also stick up for gun sales. No cherry picking. Don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t buy it. But you are obligated to defend the right of another to both sell and buy guns. Otherwise, you become a hypocrite of the worse kind. <br /><br />I personally, would not buy a gun off silk road. But I sure as hell am going to support and defend those who wish to engage in such trade. Or for any other illicit type of trading.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why? There is a great saying...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; First they came for the communists,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and I didn&#039;t speak out because I wasn&#039;t a communist.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Then they came for the trade unionists,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and I didn&#039;t speak out because I wasn&#039;t a trade unionist.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Then they came for the Jews,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and I didn&#039;t speak out because I wasn&#039;t a Jew.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Then they came for the Catholics,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and I didn&#039;t speak out because I was Protestant.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Then they came for me<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and there was no one left to speak out for me.<br /><br />Meditate on that before you worry so much about your own self interests and worldview.

Did you really just say that?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Drugs are responsible for all sorts of crime and suffering, no argument.&nbsp; But I have a feeling that those cute little innocent &quot;inanimate objects which have no potential for addiction&quot; may also be responsible for a tiny bit of suffering as well. No?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think anybody is saying guns are bad, drugs are good. But it will not help this site if the gun trade increases here, that&#039;s what concerns most people. So if freedom at all costs is acceptable, then fine. Accept the cost.<br /><br />Like the majority on here, I came to SR so I can get some nice quality recreational drugs for occasional personal use. Not guns. But I understand the political ethos of SR, so if that means gun sales increase here, I just think it will be it&#039;s downfall. And that would be a shame.<br /><br />And what&#039;s with this argument that if you stick up for drug sales, you MUST stick up for gun sales? That makes no sense at all. Using that argument we must also stick up for child porn. Freedom of choice right? No, I don&#039;t think so. Moral limits do exist don&#039;t they? Don&#039;t they?? If that makes me a hypocrite, then fair enough. I can live with it.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yep, I personally detest child porn. But a free market must be free. That&#039;s the price paid for freedom. <br /><br />There are some who want this place shut down for the sole reason that drugs are being sold. That is their moral &quot;cutoff&quot; point or limit. Even though it is not yours personally. Or some that think selling coke or LSD is just way too over the top, but are OK with weed. <br /><br />Morality is relative. And in a true free market morality has no place except in the individual&#039;s mind. <br /><br />And think about it. Society at large is not OK with you buying drugs. It&#039;s dirty and wrong in their POV. But here you are buying drugs because someone made a way for you to do that. Don&#039;t you think it&#039;s pretty stupid and hypocritical after being shunned by society at large to come up in here and do what you don&#039;t like being done to you by society at large to someone else?<br /><br />If selling guns attracts more attention, then so be it. It would only hasten the inevitable. LEO and the powers that be don&#039;t want this place to exist, period.&nbsp; They&#039;ll use any excuse to get the resources necessary. They could even use a kid who overdoses on a drug bought here as a poster child call to arms. <br /><br />As I said prior, no cherry picking. It&#039;s all or none at all. Otherwise you&#039;re just here for your own self interests and don&#039;t really care about the movement and what it represents.

				Interesting debate.<br /><br />I have to say when I was browsing the other day I saw guns and my first thought was - that arms being dealt will get a lot more international focus to bring this place down than drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />It may not in the USA where you can get guns easily, but other countries will react differently.&nbsp; <br /><br />Really, people are not that bothered about a few drugs being sold, they will be about guns.<br /><br />But then, if this is meant to be a free market then I guess it would be hypocritical to say yes to one illegal thing and not another.<br /><br />But for me personally, I would like this place to be somewhere to buy drugs.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like the guns and I certainly would not like to see child porn sold and things like that.&nbsp; I t would probably put me off the place for good.<br /><br />I may be a hypocrite, but I would rather sale of things that are specifically harming others or meant to do so was not part of this place.<br /><br />But as someone said - there is a price to freedom?

				Yeah, it is an interesting debate, no matter what side you sit.<br /><br />One thing that effects my (UK) point of view though....things are obviously different over here where guns are banned, so we have a different attitude. If someone from the UK were to buy a gun from here, it would be meant for violent use without a doubt. In fact I would assume 99% of weapons sold here are for violence. Whats&#039; the point in taking the huge risk just to shoot rabbits? And most folks from the US could go buy one anyway. So it&#039;s not just about gun sales, it&#039;s there obvious intended use.<br /><br />It&#039;s one thing supporting a free market at all costs, but another to support something that will no doubt, at some point, be used to take away somebody&#039;s ultimate freedom. And that would also make me a hypocrite.<br /><br />

				Gaia you have it all wrong! Your euro world view and school indoctrination has warped your sense of the truth. Guns AND drugs are INANIMATE objects. They don&#039;t DO anything to anyone. It takes a human being to use either one for nefarious purposes. A person in Europe could order a gun they have have no intent of ever using except for home defense, just the reason I keep mine. I raise my hand ONLY in defense! Trap and target shooting is BIG FUN and that is what the overwhelming majority of guns are used for in Europe as well as the US. Additionally, an armed populace has always been the only thing that has kept tyranny in check. In most European countries the real reason the populace has been disarmed is to maintain the political status quo, not to keep people safe. The elite could give a flying shit if the poor kill each other. But those same guns the poor use on each other can be used to take out a monarch, and the elites aren&#039;t having that. And about the child porn thing- the assertion that child porn must be allowed in a free society is absurd. The whole purpose of agorism and libertarianism is to have the freedom to do as you like as long as no one else is victimized. Research the non-aggression principle (NAP)! Child abuse does NOT fit into this model. In fact, that would be the one case where I WOULD use my weapon in a situation where I was not in personal danger- in defense of helpless children. Chomos = shit.

				Boy oh boy, I see some slippery slope thinking going on. <br /><br />Let&#039;s go with banning guns because it offends some sensibilities. Fine. Yay we did it! Whoo hooo. <br /><br />Then some think Crystal Meth is just so nasty and harmful. If offends the sensibilities. Hey, have you seen the documentaries about what happens to those hooked on crystal meth? We must therefore ban it. Ummph!<br /><br />Then some think, OMG, opiates are evil nasty shit. With H being the worst of the lot. It&#039;s so harmful. Have you seen what someone on withdrawal has to go through. I don&#039;t want to associated with that. Let&#039;s ban it. <br /><br />Then perhaps another will think, weed destroys the mind. I read this article and it shows what happens to the frontal lobe of a pothead over time. My god that&#039;s harmful. We must ban that also. <br /><br />Mmm Hmmm... you see where this is going don&#039;t you? All your subjective nonsense is exactly what happened in society such that you need to turn to a place like this. And then you have the audacity to try to enforce your will on those in this community? Come on people. Get real. <br /><br />It&#039;s a free market. Sales must dictate what can and can&#039;t be sold. Not your personal sensibilities. <br /><br />As stated, I personally object to child porn. Makes me sick. But so what? That&#039;s my personal issue. If people want to trade in a free market, child porn, I&#039;ll simply pass over it and get to the illicit drugs I like. I have no desire whatsoever to trade in firearms or explosives. So? I simply don&#039;t. <br /><br />The argument that guns will bring more heat down on this place is valid in part. But again, if a teen overdoses on drugs bought off silk road, you can believe that will also have the same effect. I can dream up other scenarios that will lead to a call of arms against this place. American LEO would love, love, love to take this place down simply for selling drugs and using virtual currency. Adding guns won&#039;t get them any more hot and bothered than they already are. In Europe perhaps it will. So what? It means now you have an international effort to take the place down. But we all know American law enforcement is the one to worry about. <br /><br />As for NAP, it&#039;s arbitrary. One man&#039;s harm is another&#039;s pleasure.&nbsp; See my examples above. Everything sold on SR can and does cause harm. <br /><br />Stop being silly and so concerned about your own self interests and sensibilities. Remember, there are many more that think this place shouldn&#039;t exist because they are simply offended by the drug trade that goes on here. Don&#039;t be like them. Free yourself. Free your mind. Live and let live is the price you are going to have to bear. In that is no relativity or subjectivity bullshit. It&#039;s purely objective and holistic.

				You guys that want guns off of SR aren&#039;t getting it. YOU AREN&#039;T GETTING IT! <br /><br />Banning ANYTHING for sale on SR would go against the constitution of SR. It is a FREE market. Banning guns won&#039;t solve anything, it will in fact make it worse. I don&#039;t advocate violence, but banning is not the right choice of moderation. Society is the problem, not guns. There are plenty of people that own guns and are very kind and loving people. <br /><br />Okay lets do a little philosophy here. This is the argument against guns:<br /><br />Guns are bad because they kill people.<br />Bad things must be banned.<br />Guns must be banned.<br /><br />What else kills people? Drugs. <br /><br />Drugs kill people. <br />Therefore drugs are bad.<br />Bad things must be banned.<br />Drugs must be banned.<br /><br /><br />See your logic here? It&#039;s not sound, unfortunately. I really wish it would be as easy as not selling guns on SR to make everyone feel better, but that wound solve ANYTHING.

				Gotta disagree about allowing everything to be sold in a free market...<br /><br />Guns can be used in ways that do not involve criminal activity.&nbsp; No crime equals no victim.&nbsp; If I want to buy a gun to hunt, shoot skeet, or simply to add to my collection, I should not be subject to governmental restriction because some people MIGHT commit crimes with them.&nbsp; I could use my car to kill someone, but cars aren&#039;t illegal.<br /><br />Drugs can be used in ways that aren&#039;t criminal.&nbsp; No crime equals no victim.<br /><br />Illegal drugs, while criminal by definition, are examples of consensual crimes.&nbsp; Consensual crime has no victim.&nbsp; A drug user gives informed consent when he takes a drug.&nbsp; He is responsible for his own actions, and for whatever effect the drug has on him.<br /><br />Child pornography is a different beast entirely.&nbsp; It is illegal, and victimizes the children involved.&nbsp; One cannot posses child pornography without a child having been victimized in the process of making it.&nbsp; Below a certain age, a child simply cannot give informed consent.&nbsp; Below what age?&nbsp; Who knows...&nbsp; It probably depends on the child, but I&#039;m not talking about &quot;teen porn&quot; here, I&#039;m talking about kiddie porn.<br /><br />While I am against all forms of censorship by government, I do not find it objectionable for a free market like Silk Road to maintain a certain standard, and for such a standard to be policed by the community at large.&nbsp; I don&#039;t consider the victimization of a child in order to produce a product to be concentric with the principles of agorism.<br /><br />

				every US citizen has the right to bear arms. In california it takes forever with background checks, etc before you can even get one.

				Would somebody please care to explain to me how in the fucking world you even ship a gun?<br /><br />How do you get something like this through international customs? <br /><br />Personally, you could not pay me money to receive a gun in the mail. I am positive that if a gun was found being sent to you, it would surely be followed up by law enforcement unlike drugs which are easily disregarded.<br /><br />I would prefer if we did not allow gun sales because I too think it attracts an unnecessary amount of unwanted attention but I do understand that this a free market and can also see why we allow it.

				There&#039;s a lot of shit that I DON&#039;T want to see on SR, and I agree that if SR gets a reputation for being a source of guns (which, really, will only take one European murderer admitting he got his gun from here - Americans can&#039;t really fathom it, but shootings in Europe are so rare that they&#039;re typically jaw-dropping-OMG-front-page news) that this site will be in trouble.&nbsp; America might rant and rave about drugs, but most of the world doesn&#039;t give two shits, and as much as they&#039;d like, America can&#039;t bring this site down by itself.&nbsp; Guns will bring a worldwide crackdown and a vast international effort to find SR and shut it down by any means necessary.<br /><br />That being said, to ban guns (or, for that matter, banning anything) would instantly end this experiment in a truly free market.&nbsp; It may mean that Silk Road gets shut down someday.&nbsp; It may mean that we have to tolerate things we find immoral, like date rape drugs and the aforementioned child pornography.&nbsp; But I really don&#039;t want to see Silk Road lose its lofty ideals.

You are most definitely missing the point and are being hypocritical. Policed by the community? That&#039;s exactly what society at large has done making a place like this necessary. Where does it stop? Ban guns then ban what else next? Some other thing people decide is no longer acceptable? Silk Road must never be dictated to by the whims and changeable sensibilities of any one person or group. Otherwise we&#039;re right back to where we started except it will just be an alternate society which mirrors the one at large. <br /><br />Realize that there are people here who may take objection to H or cocaine being sold. If enough of them with similar sensibilities were to band together to make their voice heard, those things could potentially be banned. And so on and so forth until the only thing agreed upon is the sale of weed.<br /><br />The point of SR is not to have your voice heard as in a democracy where a slight majority can disenfranchise a large or small group of others based on their sensibilities or beliefs. The point of SR is a free market. Where sales dictate what is sold. <br /><br />I love SR also. But if selling guns increases the likelihood of it being shut down (which has no substantiated basis other than fear). So be it. At least it died standing for something unique, noble and pure and not some mere subset of society at large with slightly differing rules.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Remove your sensibilities from the equation and you&#039;ll see it for what it is. <br /><br />There are many, many who think there is nothing noble about selling illicit drugs. But because your particular sensibility finds nothing wrong with it, you&#039;re fine with it. See? Silk Road as it is, removes varying and changing personal sensibilities from the equation and let&#039;s only market forces dictate what is viable or not. And that&#039;s the way it is supposed to be. <br /><br />Hey, if a certain drug falls out of favor, guess what? It won&#039;t be sold anymore. And that has happened. We didn&#039;t need the vocalization of variable and changeable sensibilities and individual morals to make that happen. They simply weren&#039;t selling in a quantity enough to make it worth the seller&#039;s while.&nbsp; <br /><br />In that is the noble effort of Silk Road. It allows only market forces to dictate. Where else in the world can you say that is the case without outside artificial intervention?<br /><br />Now do you understand? If not, oh well. Likely it won&#039;t matter because those who run Silk Road will stick to their ideal and protect it as best they can from outside and internal forces that would seek to dictate to it. <br />&nbsp;

				If you want a gun, get a license. They&#039;re available legally just about everywhere. Most drugs are not. When people get hurt or die from guns, unless it&#039;s suicide, it&#039;s because someone else shoots them. When people get hurt or die through drug use/abuse, it&#039;s usually their own fault. Personally, I&#039;d rather not see guns sold here on SR but a free market is a free market. <br /><br />Regarding LEO finding even more reason to try to shut this place down (if they can even do that), this whole enterprise is so tenuous that it amazes me that SR even exists in the first place. And all of us drug users should not be naive to think that purchasing illegal drugs is so innocent. We have no way of knowing where and to who exactly our drug money goes. I&#039;m sure plenty of our dollars flow to some kind of syndicates/cartels that are responsible for thousands of murders. I only buy weed myself but there is no way to know whether that friendly cannabis farmer is some enterprising cultivator or part of some Mexican cartel.<br /><br />In terms of child porn purveyors, I do advocate for gun usage on them (I&#039;m only kind of kidding). Call me a prude but scum is scum and there is no way to justify the exploitation of children.

				The sellers guide is a clear indication that SR does NOT blindly support a free market, it imposes it&#039;s own restrictions on pedophilia and contract killing so many arguments of the protection of freedom and liberty are already relatively moot.<br /><br />The fact remains that if we want to protect our community we must also protect the public&#039;s perception of said community. Put it this way, if I told my mum &quot;yeah there&#039;s this site you can buys pills and weed on&quot; she&#039;d be like &quot;meh, you kids today don&#039;t know anything about drugs... i grew up in the 60&#039;s ffs&quot;. If I said &quot;hey mum you know there&#039;s this site you go and buy grenade launchers on&quot; she would probably have the internet disconnected from her house. This might be a slight exaggeration but you get my point.<br /><br />The other interesting thing I&#039;ve noticed is the clear pro gun attitude of US citizens, and slightly cautionary attitude of EU, AUS ones... I think that&#039;s funny, because given the right licenses and no criminal record you can basically buy any weapon you desire legally in the US, the only reason you&#039;d want to buy an illegal firearm is because you are likely to commit illegal actions with it?

You yourself argue that there should be no limit to what is advertised and sold here, yet the link to the buyers guide (thanks bozangles, I really should have read that first!) states that there are indeed limits. So most of the list I facetiously made, and that you agreed to, is actually not allowed. <br /><br />So the argument that this place should be a free and unrestricted market is actually not part of SR&#039;s policy after all.<br /><br />I repeat myself here when I say that irrespective of my opinion on guns, my problem is with the dangers some items pose to SR. Again Their guidelines seem to support this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Practically speaking, there are many powerful adversaries of Silk Road and if we are to survive, we must not take them all on at once.

So certain things are restricted just so we don&#039;t scare too many off.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So like others, I just fear for the future of SR should things get out of control.<br /><br />As for gun sales...we will always have different views on this because here in the UK, it&#039;s just not a part of our culture. And our perceptions are that apart from gun clubs and farmers, most guns are used in crime. If the UK press got wind that SR was selling guns to UK residents, there would be a hell of a lot more negative exposure than any site selling drugs could ever do. There is an unspoken tolerance to drugs here, far, far more than there is for guns anyway. <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve enjoyed this debate. We will have to agree to disagree I suppose. But it&#039;s been fun. <br /><br />Well argued anyway BenJesuit et-al :)

				Yep, the SR should be free argument is somewhat moot given the polite suggestion that certain things shouldn&#039;t be sold here. (It&#039;s polite not just because of the word &quot;please&quot; but because those things can be sold irrespective of the heading of &quot;prohibited.&quot;) <br /><br />And that&#039;s what&#039;s great. The creators respect the free market aspect of it, going so far as calling sellers &quot;revolutionaries&quot;, all the while admonishing a perspective seller that while they might sell something like that, doing so may lead to undue scrutiny of the powers that be.&nbsp; There&#039;s no speak of banning. <br /><br />Now, we would hope that those buying guns never commit some act that leads to heightened scrutiny of SR in as much as those the buy GHB don&#039;t use it to victimize a non-consenting person. But, that&#039;s the risk we face in an open market. Just as unscrupulous persons come here to victimize trusting people just looking to self-medicate and/or enjoy all that life has to offer. <br /><br />In closing, I see everyone understands and I even better understand the POV of everyone while sharing the same fear of losing SR.&nbsp; Thanks to all for the discourse. It was a good and necessary thing to flesh out.

				I am not one those &quot;pissy liberals&quot;, as america so eloquently stated, I&#039;m all for gun ownership. I&#039;m not even going to say that I haven&#039;t bought a gun on the streets myself - some people seriously need one for protection! However i sold that gun. Why? because guns bring heat!!<br /><br />Which brings me to my point, and the one I think others are missing, it&#039;s not a question of morality or sesiblities or whatever, the real problem is that GUNS=PUBLIC ATTENTION, PUBLIC ATTENTION=BAD.<br /><br />I too wish that people would stop selling guns on here (mayb they make their own anonmyous marketplace or something), but we can&#039;t very well prevent them selling guns either as that would contradict SR.... The ol&#039; catch-22<br /><br />@redforeva&nbsp; <br />You don;t honestly believe that whole &quot;best defense against tyranny is a well armed populous&quot; crap, do you? I mean c&#039;mon!

				@ theradblur I will BUY you the gun if you use it on Glenn Beck! lol jk.<br /><br />Public attention to this site, despite what most in this thread think, is not bad! Even SR says it themselves. They WANT more attention because more attention means more buyers and sellers. More buyers and sellers mean a better selection and a more competitive market. That&#039;s good for everyone. Everyone on this thread needs to study the NAP (non-aggression principle). As long as you don&#039;t hurt anyone and only enter into voluntary exchange, everything is all good! It&#039;s basically that there is nothing inherently good or bad, it is the intention of the human being that makes it so. Everyone is talking about guns and drugs as if they are human beings with motivations and they AREN&#039;T! Censorship is WRONG, and SR seems to get it.

				Very well put adubois. <br /><br />You&#039;re quite right about NAP. After looking over it again, yes you&#039;re correct. It&#039;s not simply about things that could do harm, but rather persons who seek to do harm. Because if it literally were against things that do harm, drugs would fall under that category. Yes, drugs can and do harm - medical and scientifc fact. Though if used properly, may not cause harm or the harm can be greatly minimized. <br /><br />And yes, we can&#039;t assume intent to buy a firearm is to harm because intent may also be to deter harm. <br /><br />The argument that it will draw unwanted attention is invalid for sure. But what is valid is that should a firearm bought off SR is used in a crime in Europe, it would draw the ire of Law Enforcement. However valid the fear is, it leaves out one important thing - how likely would it be proven that the firearm was bought off SR? The one who bought it could say they got it off some guy and leave it at that. Or they could stay mum. Who knows. He may have practiced excellent security such that if his computer used to do the transaction were taken to forensics, they&#039;d find nothing. <br /><br />So in the end, the fear is just that, fear. It&#039;s not substantiated in the least. So perhaps the fear is also intermixed with personal sensibilities against guns in general.

				I said this on another thread somewhere: <br /><br />yea, drugs are one thing (an awesome thing) - but guns...? I mean common. With drugs, it&#039;s all about the escape, the happiness, subconscious exploration, and feeding the black market. With guns, yea it can be about protection - but if you&#039;re buying illegally, chances are it&#039;s not just for fucking protection. If that were the case, why not just buy one from a gun store - or better yet, a gun show? All of this damn gun talk is going to do is bring the wrong type of people here (LE, violent criminals, etc.). And for what cost? So some dudes can get a damn Uzi sent to their door?? You don&#039;t need a fucking semi-automatic - let alone a full-automatic or a damn grenade launcher - to protect your family. By allowing this type of traffic, will only fuck over the peaceful members in the end. And none of us want that.

				I am a survivor of the 80s and the potent combination of what happens when guns and drugs mix under loose police controls and where the murder rate skyrocketed to where in New York City alone there were 2200 murders a year. A lot of people are a little bit younger and can&#039;t remember this time....but it really is LESS VIOLENT these days.<br /><br />We can debate all day whether guns are necessary for society or not, but the fact is we all have a cause being part of this site, whether we like it or not... and 99.9% its not for gun legalization or looser gun controls. Its for free trade of goods in an agorist community/structure. <br /><br />If we want to convert non-believers and normal people to that cause and possibly have them join us, we should make them feel better about it by showing that we have limits. Then they will generally agree that we have a right to exist, rather than try to eliminate us (if we were child pornographers)<br /><br />We have all agreed that child porn is off limits. If we agree that guns are off limits and only drugs (or other banned contraband which doesn&#039;t hurt other people other than the user) than that would make us heroes rebelling against an unjust society, rather than creeps who need to be eliminated by the police forces. <br /><br />Right now the media and public opinion (which matters) is swinging in the other direction against us.... people can accept drugs, because everyone uses drugs. But not everyone understands or likes guns. <br /><br />So we should decide what matters more - building this community or being right on principle.<br /><br />So even though its against principle, we should BAN GUNS.

And thanks for the compliment in regards to my position on the matter. But I don&#039;t see how my continued participation in the thread is a problem. Especially when new posters to the thread who understandably haven&#039;t read all the posts preceding their own, continue to post similarly. Whether pro or con. Are only new posters to the thread allowed to echo the same opposing sentiments as my own in countering other new participants with the opposite position?<br /><br />If others post similarly to my position, why can&#039;t I also be granted the freedom to continue to participate? Perhaps new thoughts can blossom on the matter. A slight variation on the theme can do that sometimes. <br /><br />So I find it to be quite a strange request on your part? Think about it for a second. Think about what you are asking.&nbsp; <br /><br />You don&#039;t like seeing my continued posts because they &quot; tire you.&quot; And for that, you would have me to stop? Moreover, you&#039;d like the issue to &quot;die&quot; but how can it when there&#039;s no official expressly stated opinion on the matter. That gun sales persist only implies the official position. So you&#039;re also asking those who would like to see guns banned to stop voicing their concern also.&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems as if whatever you don&#039;t like, you want gone or stopped. Why didn&#039;t you opt to simply stop reading the thread if it tires you? It seems you&#039;d rather impose your sensibility on others than to let others have the freedom to express themselves and converse as they may. <br /><br />I mean, I&#039;d like to oblige you seeing as my continued participation appears to harm you. But that you have other alternatives to reduce or even eliminate the harm caused by having to read or even see my posts, I&#039;m not as inclined to oblige your request as I would be if those other alternatives did not exist. <br /><br />:)<br />

The owners/admins of SR obviously don&#039;t see gun sales as a threat to SR. The fear that gun sales will rouse LE into certain action is an unsubstantiated fear no matter how reasonable the fear may seem. The owners/admins of SR have a good thing going and they know it and they don&#039;t want to lose it. So we should probably trust that they know what they are doing by holding firmer to the principle of what SR represents. That being a free market where what sells or not is dictated by trade between parties and not by the imposition of one&#039;s or a group&#039;s sensibilities. <br /><br />It seems there are two main positions against gun sales. <br /><br />1. Fear that gun sales will hasten the demise of SR.<br />2. Having a sensibility that opposes firearms in general. <br /><br />I share both as I&#039;m sure others do also. But I would rather hold to the ideal that SR is to be a free market. So I wouldn&#039;t want to impose my sensibilities on another. I simply won&#039;t buy any firearms off SR. And if enough people don&#039;t, the market for gun sales will likely wane. <br /><br />I apologize to Gaia for making another post and hope that gaia is not harmed by reading this post. if perhaps Gaia could skip over it, that would please us both.

				I&#039;m in Canada and there is huge demand for blackmarket guns. Typically American truckers stop in Arizona, or Virginia or some other state where you can legally buy a dozen handguns all at once and stash them in their truck for sale once they drop off their load in Ontario/BC/wherever at 5x the price.<br /><br />The punishment for weapons smuggling out of the US is basically nothing. I read a news article on how one US trucker was caught numerous times selling guns in Canada but nothing happened to him back home. US does not care if you smuggle guns out of the US but they sure as hell do care if you&#039;re illegally selling within the borders. <br /><br />Police in my city claim 22 homicides last year were all traced back to the same gun store in VA who refused to give out any info, and legally don&#039;t have to give any buyer info to foreign countries. So for exporting American&#039;s that know what they&#039;re doing you are safe.
