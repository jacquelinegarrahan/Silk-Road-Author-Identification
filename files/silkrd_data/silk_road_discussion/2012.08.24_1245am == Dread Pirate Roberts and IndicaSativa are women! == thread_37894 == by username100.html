				If there&#039;s some overwhelming advantage to having a female avatar, I must have missed it between all the misogynistic pine themed threads created and threatening/creepy PMs received. The only tangible advantage I can think of was gulling some people into learning PGP. I&#039;d say the advantage of the latter was well and truly canceled out by the former. Pine doesn&#039;t tell you whether pine is a male or a female for extremely obvious reasons that ought to be well understood and appreciated by a forum of anonymous cyber criminals. I think I can tell you I am a mammal. Proud of belonging to the mammal kingdom, a friend to all the warm blooded furry animals I can think of. llamas, cats, otters, kangaroos and squirrels. I don&#039;t believe in a creator, but consider the platypus reasonable evidence for the argument on the other side. I mean that thing is very close to being too hilarious to be real. Hopefully, with either reincarnation or much more likely modern science&#039;s genetic engineering, pine will be able to come back and define oneself as a platypus. Now you know the truth. There&#039;s more interesting things to be than a female or a male. You could be a platypus.<br /><br />/platypus pine :)
