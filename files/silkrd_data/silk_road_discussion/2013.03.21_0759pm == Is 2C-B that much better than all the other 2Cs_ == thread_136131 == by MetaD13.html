				I&#039;ve tried other 2cs and nbomes before, but didn&#039;t really like them. Although everyone seems to regard 2C-B as one of the most enjoyable psychedelics comparing it to LSD and MDMA. Is it really that much different than the other 2Cs?

				i really dont get it myself i found it to be the most unpsycadelic of all of them..slightly better body high but even in high doses the visuals are no more than weed and less than good weed(fuzzy sparkles ya know) its soooo damn expensive. i think 2-3mg 2c-p is more visual than 40+mg 2c-b...but thats just me/my wife.<br /><br />o and i LOVE the 2c&#039;s ALL of them just not 2c-b. its lame

				I&#039;ve only tried 2c-i, 2c-e, and 2c-b.&nbsp; Also the nbome&#039;s but I&#039;m leaving them out for now.&nbsp; The 2c&#039;s do very little for me.&nbsp; Hardly any visuals and some body load and that&#039;s it, even at 30mg insufflated or 60mg oral.&nbsp; I&#039;ve mixed them, taken individual high doses of each, insufflated them both alone and after/before eating some, and no matter what I do they just always fail to impress me.<br /><br />25c-nbome is quite wonderful, however.&nbsp; And mescaline is my favorite substance out there...&nbsp; Aside from weed, of course.

				25c-nbome always gives me a nasty bodyload and the comeup is a bitch...I don&#039;t mess with any of the rc&#039;s anymore though<br /><br />I&#039;ll give 2CB a shot tho..its gotten too much praise for me to just simply ignore

				2C-B is fucking fantastic in my opinion. I personally do not get any body load at all, no rough come down and have I unbelievable amounts of love and humor coursing through my body. I get no mind fuck, no rough comedown and I get amazing visual effects. I like the fact I can get weird as fuck and see shit move and sway but I don&#039;t have to consider the possibilities of the universe, my existence and life like I do when tripping on LSD. If you&#039;re looking for introspection then 2C-B just won&#039;t do the job but if you just want to see stuff morph and change while laughing your ass off, it&#039;s the chemical to look to. I can&#039;t praise it highly enough.

Or your shit is bunk.<br /><br />2c-b owns for visuals. Nice clear head. 25mg insufflated is nice, minus the 2 mins of pain lol. 45-50mg oral works but waiting 2-3 hours sucks. Either way massive OEV &amp; CEV&#039;s. Mixed with LSD rules :)<br /><br />You&#039;re only person i know that thinks it sucks.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve tried 18-20 mgs of 2-cb orally on two different occasions with very little effect. I likely have a higher than normal NATURAL tolerance to psychedelics though, judging from past experiences. I talked to the vendor I got it from, 03welle, and 03welle told me I should try snorting a cap which I have yet to try. I&#039;m tempted to swallow 2 caps but then I have less 2-cb&nbsp; :-\ Hopefully, upping my ROA will increase my reaction because, from what I read, 2-cb sounds perfect for me. By the way, I would definitely recommend 03welle for whomever it may pertain to.

				To answer the original question, 2CB is by no means magical but it is fun when taken in the right context. My experience with it seems best described as a pleasant body high and at higher does visuals that are more like slapping on a pair of special effects goggles where you see the world diferently but don&#039;t feel the world differently. In other words you keep a pretty clear head but get some good visual fun. Taken as a replacement to LSD most people would consider it lame. Taken for it&#039;s own properties it can be quite fun. I personally enjoy it at the end of a MDMA roll. Takes the urge to drop more MDMA away and lets me ride out the roll into another sort of trip.<br /><br />Normally when I dose it on it&#039;s own it&#039;s not going to make me have any world shattering revelations but it makes watching cartoons with the wife more fun. I&#039;ve dosed it up high enough where it definitely gets mental and time starts breaking down while reality fractures into incoherent slices but even then it wasn&#039;t anything like a locked loop bad acid trip. I knew it was the drug, I knew it would pass so it was easy to enjoy it.<br /><br />If you want more info I have a little 2CB thread that stays pretty active at http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106130.0. I don&#039;t sell the stuff or even suggest everyone try it but it is fun as long as you don&#039;t go into it thinking it&#039;s a cross between LSD and MDMA because it&#039;s far from that.
