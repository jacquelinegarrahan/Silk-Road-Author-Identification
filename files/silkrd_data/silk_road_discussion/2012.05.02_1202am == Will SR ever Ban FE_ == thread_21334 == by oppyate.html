				Just briefly imagine an honest vendors perspective: Happily shipping product to a customer with 0/0 buying stats? No way! There would be no honest vendor left sooner or later. <br /><br />I agree something needs to be done about the whole issue, but ban FE entirely? <br /><br />There&#039;s always two sides of the story

				OR what about a tiered FE system.<br /><br />0 transaction history : 100% FE<br />&lt;3 transactions: 75% FE (cover wholesale price and cost of shipping)<br />&lt;5 transactions: 50% FE (cover wholesale price)<br />&lt;6 transactions: 25% FE (cover shipping)<br />6+ transactions: 100% escrow. <br /><br />With options for special orders to 50/50% FE/Escrow. <br /><br />Just a thought. But really, I have never finalized early for any vendor. I only deal with vendors that use the escrow system. I haven&#039;t lost money yet and I have over 50 transactions. I am currently in my first resolution with a vendor that got arrested and skipped out having never shipped. We&#039;ll see how that goes.

First, you ignore that there are legitimate reasons for FE. It&#039;s not just buyers with 0/0 but there are an infinite number of circumstances that just make it infeasible for a vendor to ship a high value item and wait up to 17 days for payment. Not to mention that buyers not finalizing on time (after receiving their items) is an increasing problem. Banning FE and ignoring this legitimate issue will lead to people transacting outside the escrow/feedback system altogether, which is a worse outcome than status quo.<br /><br />Second, a lot of people deal exclusively in escrow already. I&#039;ve been a vendor here for a whole year now and I&#039;ve never transacted outside escrow. Neither have I done so as a buyer. Many other people can attest to the same thing. Your analysis on how there is an oligopoly is drug vendors on SR is indeed true. But I think the difference between those who got scammed and those who didn&#039;t is that we are ok with not buying any drugs at all unless the vendor uses escrow. It is as simple as that. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY ANYTHING HERE. You do so voluntarily. And if you VOLUNTARILY put yourself in this position they you must take responsibility for it. Talking about oligopolies doesn&#039;t negate the fact that there is no gun to your head forcing you to buy.

				I do a lot of business with new buyers with no stats, I never require FE and I have never been scammed. I have had one transaction go as far as auto finalizing. A lot of my customers finalize immediately without ever being asked to.<br />It strikes me that the possibility of scamming by a buyer is far, far, outweighed by the possibility of a vendor scamming and as such asking for&nbsp; FE should be banned.

				@ OP - why the fuck should SR ban something because you allow because you choose to go out of the system that they built for your protection. <br /><br />Like I said in other threads. DPR ain&#039;t your Dad and you ain&#039;t a kid. Take responsibility. <br /><br />I only use FE for 2 things. 1 for no-to-low history customers (0-5) or if I were to buy something in for someone (electronics etc). Other than that there ain&#039;t much need IMO. <br /><br />

				I hate to just be an echo chamber for the points already made here, but seriously, SR admin has taken plenty of effort to warn people about the risk of finalizing early, and nobody is responsible but buyers who decide to FE, and banning it would be pointless. You shouldn&#039;t ever make an order here bigger than you&#039;re willing and able to loose; I hope that every one I make comes through but I expect it not to in the meantime. Guess what? 100% success rate so far, and from more orders than I&#039;m comfortable admitting. I refuse to finalize orders unless the seller is willing to break up the order and let half of it stay in escrow. I&#039;ve told vendors to cancel my orders otherwise, and guess what, it saved me from getting scammed. <br /><br />Obviously OP is referring to tony, and I was always leery of that guy. I was one of his first customers and caught him in a lie on my first and only order with him. I repeatedly warned people about FE when he ran his sales, but there&#039;s herd behavior here to an extent that still shocks me. Every time there&#039;s been a big scam here, the burn victims always cry foul of admin and FE and make all kinds of bogus rationalizations that steer the blame everywhere else but from them. I just shake my head. Hopefully now that people have seen that even a #1 seller that would sell out on tickets to let buyers lick the salt from his balls can rip and run in a flash, maybe it sets a precedent that people can learn from. Honestly, I&#039;d take the other side of that bet any day though, because it&#039;s always the same old story here, and people are dumb as fuck, no offense. They&#039;ll literally line up and give their coins away if they see enough other people doing it. Anyway here&#039;s my tony conspiracy theory: he planned to have a limited run on SR because it&#039;s a lot safer to pop in, make a killing, and disappear than it is to try and run a steady business on here, during which time LE could track you down. Knowing he was going to dip out at some point anyway, why not walk away with a few extra thousand bitcoins? Sure, it&#039;s morally questionable, but so is selling heroin...it doesn&#039;t necessarily attract mother teresa types, nomsain? The key lesson here is INCENTIVES. <br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, here&#039;s Nikodym&#039;s two rules for success on SR:<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t be desperate.<br /><br />2. Make sure the vendor&#039;s incentives are aligned with yours.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				This is why I&#039;m glad I have the opportunity to browse the forums and get an idea of the personalities behind the listings.<br /><br />Knowing who you are buying off of is and their reputation in real time is an excellent way to determine whether or not you will be scammed.<br /><br />Personally I would like to at least have some interaction with a vendor, via thread or detailed post, so I can get an idea of who I&#039;m buying from and what their intentions are.<br /><br />My goal is wide spread local distribution of some potent products so finalizing early and getting scammed on a bulk shipment cannot happen.<br /><br />Therefore browsing the forums [and seeing whose handing out samples :) ] is a great way to get an idea on whose honest or at least trying to be.

				I have no issue doing an FE for a vendor I have had several successful transactions with in order to help them out financially. It is amazing how quickly the sums add up when you are selling on a global basis. When I have done this I have been rewarded with heavy shipments.&nbsp; The vendors I have communicated with have all had problems with new buyers so I gladly give them the upper hand when dealing on SR. I&#039;ve cruised enough shady parts of towns in 30 years of &quot;expressing my freedom&quot; and been in positions where I have wondered if I would be killed in the process. I&#039;ll gladly chance a few hundred dollars over dark alleys.

				In my eyes finalizing early is no different than going out of escrow.<br />Once you finalize the transaction is final and there is no safety net for vendor excuses why you never received your order.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad bloodbath

				Wow OP, listen at yourself! You&#039;re turning into the same people that SR stands against!<br /><br />BAN THIS, TAX THAT, REGULATE THIS, DO THAT<br /><br />Wow, just... wow.<br /><br /><br /><br />When it comes down to it, if the buyer does FE, that is his right. There are multiple warnings about it, so buyers know that it is not reverseable.&nbsp; If he doesn&#039;t want to FE, then the buy can find another person to do business with. Its that simple. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really see an issue at all with FE as long as the vendor is reputable. Most of the time F&#039;ing E goes off just fine. You might think it seems like everyone is scamming, but its only a very very small fraction of sellers.

				I agree that SR needs to ban FE. Any real vendor who is honest will not be requiring it or asking for it. It seems simple to me. Why not just take down the listing if you don&#039;t have the stock to sell it or the cash to cover all the cost of offering it and shipping it on an escrow basis? I mean, they will be paid, the money is tied up in escrow so the buyer can&#039;t spend it. And the vendors should not send a product that wasn&#039;t honestly advertised. I mean, if a vendors page says 99% pure then that is what it needs to be. If it&#039;s 50 to 60 percent then they need to be honest and say that.
