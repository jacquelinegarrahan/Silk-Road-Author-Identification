I hope that you are ready for the bust that will surely come from &#039;looking for customers&#039;<br />The reason we do SR is to avoid the search. Customers will come to you - do you really want to have to look at all our ugly mugs? 8)

				DO NOT SELL if you need to ask this question.<br />You need to build a network of people to sell to.<br /><br />It starts by selling to a few trusted friends, then expanding to friends of friends, etc.<br />But you need to stop somewhere. My advice would be to never get too big.<br />Personally, I buy bulk and sell to 4-5 other people who buy semi-bulk regularly and also sell smaller amounts to up to 70 people IRL.<br />I know them all and I don&#039;t just sell to randoms.<br /><br />It took me a long time to establish myself. It doesn&#039;t just happen overnight. <br />Slow growth is safe. Or if you want, sell on BMR / Sheep.<br />But be very careful and&nbsp; think everything through many times before you begin.

				if you go to da hood u can get just about anything sold<br />but it really depends on what you have usually they just find you<br /><br />if you have xtc go to alot of parties and night clubs<br />if you smell like good weed u will get lots of attention from smokers this happens to me often<br />if u go to a tobacco store ur pretty much guaranteed to find weed customers <br />if ur product is good they will always come back and bring u tons of clientel

				The drugs should really sell themselves, specially if you get good molly, or pills from a good vendor, bcuz where I&#039;m from we have shit pills, and people buy it anyway, not knowing what MDMA is, but if you got good E, you will make a killing, just hit the clubs, party scene up, and if you can hand off samples then do it.<br /><br />Same with good weed, just like others stated, let them know you have a certain product, and word will get around town fast, that you have the best shit, and watch the money pile up, and your phone ring off the hook to the point it&#039;s annoying.<br /><br />Be safe.
