				UPDATE (feb 7th): The PIN reset process is now automated.&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=PIN<br />If you locked your PIN within the past few days, there&#039;s a chance you&#039;ll see a message at the top of your homepage.&nbsp; If anything seems off, just message support and we&#039;ll get you sorted out.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />We&#039;ve made a few small changes to the site to help people get answers to their questions more quickly and to lighten the load on our support staff.<br /><br />When you click on the support link in the footer of the site, instead of being prompted to send a message, you are sent to a page with instructions for finding an answer to your question, which includes an FAQ page on the wiki, searching these forums if you can&#039;t find your answer there, and posting to the customer support section of these forums.&nbsp; My hope is that the mods and senior members of the forum will spend some time on these boards helping out the newbs.<br /><br />We also get way too many people asking for PIN and password resets, so I&#039;ve changed the account page to show a warning message about making sure you know your PIN and password before making a deposit if you&#039;ve never made a deposit on the account, or haven&#039;t in a few months.<br /><br />We&#039;ll see how well this works, but my hope is that it will cut down dramatically on the number of messages we get each day.<br /><br />cheers,<br />DPR<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJREf2VAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olXe0H/iyHUa6+749UAdES48gscKAm<br />7e5uju027QmUtUtyiyjBWtp//TvBUFT+C41qrX4eruK9kF2gqSnMksliydS+d7WG<br />6uAAWmK9H5+x64NYxgX9gmRssyZUa/1+NQInGK5Ud75NyN34M7+OXq7Wjh3EDn7p<br />omPXSLjddnmNl7SL5s8jY61vON1wrDNRh6tBu+RERwEFQPyD813HhJQaR6sodY5A<br />wtKN+l0I8+Mua0X8iuwHTD//7SrO9hsoVajirpfaCjUhmZc015VMDtH2q9UShTEG<br />7kFg4qgDGOsB3IWYHM9tqqCgpZmcAoiMMCEWQIu0n2CrTvzRlXpt4NQn7nUsphg=<br />=4hcV<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

				Nice to see some word from the man himself.&nbsp; I am wondering- is there some secret to getting access to the &quot;vendors only&quot; forum?&nbsp; I have been trying and asking and asking and trying for months.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never gotten a reply from any of my requests to Indigo- is he the wrong person to ask?&nbsp; I have 99.7% positive feedback from LOTS of transactions over the last 10 months.&nbsp; Are vendors who ask for FE being excluded?

				Maybe that&#039;s why I had the most unusual thing happen last night. (I actually sent admin a msg :-[) - Haven&#039;t done that in a while!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I know I didn&#039;t do anything to make this happen. What I DID do was&nbsp; right-click on two order #&#039;s to open in sepaerate windows, as I always do, to make sure when I ordered, when they shipped, etc. <br /><br />Well I ended up in the middle of two finalization&#039;s on each page! I don&#039;t think I could do that again if I TRIED!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I wonder if it had anything to do with the &quot;upgrades&quot; being done.&nbsp; I had no intention on FE early, nor was I being asked to by these two vendors, but they&#039;re both cool, and trustworthy, so I won&#039;t get a rash about it all.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />That explains it. Always gets a little &quot;glitchy&quot; when a an upgrade is made. Just like any system.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;..And the band played on!&quot;<br /><br />Peace 8)<br /><br />jagfug
