				MarijuanaismyMuse has the best Stereo Isomer ketamine on SR... it&#039;s slightly more expensive than others but once you try the product you realize why. It&#039;s the best S+ Ketamine I&#039;ve had since 3 dames was selling it 15 months ago.<br />Also I&#039;m a dissociative expert so when I speak of Ketamine I know exactly what I&#039;m speaking of and it&#039;s quality.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad
