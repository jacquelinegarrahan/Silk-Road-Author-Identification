				A while ago DPR posted a few different backup sites just in case SR was under attack...I wrote them down but I&#039;ve misplaced them.&nbsp; Can anyone share em with me? The main site seems to hardly ever work and someone yesterday said that it&#039;s soo slow when it&#039;s under attack...idk if this is true or not but better safe than sorry.

				No they are the actual back-up sites in case the regular silkroadvb5piz3r.onion becomes unavailable. I would never deliberately point anyone towards a scam site.<br /><br />Here is the official topic:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32771.0<br /><br />

				No, they are all down because they&#039;re backup sites. One of them goes online only if something happens to the main site.

				The impression I get from the original post by DPR is that these links will only go live if the main silkraodvb5piz3r.onion URL goes down permanently/semi-permanently.

				Indeed. SR worked just fine for me a few hours ago. Every site can have temporary issues. Expect these backups to only go online if something serious happens to the Road, not if the server just has some downtime.

				Might be server overload indeed. But I will keep repeating myself: SR makes enough money a day to rent a lot of dedicated servers. They could synchronize all of them or use the cloud network like the pirate bay does.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been hosting some websites and was subscribed to some. But downtimes this long I never experienced yet.<br /><br />But this just makes me learn more: I was depending on SR&#039;s stability too much.<br /><br />Maybe it would be a good idea to create a thread with suggestions to improve SR, with polls? <br /><br /><br />

				FYI-&nbsp; if it&#039;s not on your property, it&#039;s essentially in &quot;the cloud&quot;.&nbsp; the cloud is a marketing term for anything that you connect to through and internet connection.&nbsp; so SR is in &quot;the cloud&quot;.&nbsp; how about that?&nbsp; 0_o

				I believe what our misguided friend meant was that SR could use some commission funds to purchase infrastructure as a service, with physical servers/data centers located somewhere other than DPR&#039;s property.<br />Can&#039;t say for sure that DPR doesn&#039;t already do this.

				Geez, you can sync databases located over different countries blablabla. piratebay is not anonymous, yet the only thing that can be conviscated is a router, which can be reinstalled in no time. Then there is another thing that can be found. They can move from cloud to cloud.<br /><br />SR makes money from vendors opening up, and from every transaction. The piratebay has no such things, has illegal stuff on it (although it&#039;s the users who have the files).<br /><br />Perhaps its the hidden service thing that makes it harder/impossible. But downtimes for hours and hours days after days. I just cant believe that that is possible with so much money involved.<br /><br />Tell me im wrong, with good arguments and details. <br /><br />The piratebay cant be stopped anymore. Perhaps in the future with better tech, but not now. SR should learn from this as much as possible.<br />Or at least give updates or whatever instead of being mysteriously down for an unknown time, captcha&#039;s missing, etc. There is such a thing called checking server load. If it&#039;s too loaded, you need to fix this.<br />If you don;t know how, spend the amount of 10 vendors that opened on a guy and he will do it with $1500.<br /><br /><br /><br />
