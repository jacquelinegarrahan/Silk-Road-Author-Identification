				I have had the same problem a few times today. It seems to take a few minutes to get one page to load. I wonder what causes this.

				As far as I can tell the site is down. For a while it was chugging away trying to peel the onion and get there but now every time it just gives the Problem Loading Page with message &quot;Unable to connect&quot; immediately.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been getting this message all day except for once I was able to log on briefly but then got a problem load page while surfing around. Certainly acting like a site that is down or under heavy load.
