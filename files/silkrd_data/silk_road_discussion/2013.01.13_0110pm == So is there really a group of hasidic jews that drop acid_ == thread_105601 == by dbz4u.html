				I think I recall thinking about what God of the Old Testament would say about drug use in general.&nbsp; When I looked into it briefly, I think I ran into the fact that God commands all people to obey the law of the land, which led me to conclude that as long as it is legal by the governments standards, then it&#039;s all good religion-wise, as long as it doesn&#039;t conflict with some other divine mandate.<br /><br />So, without knowing exactly what hasidic jews believe regarding the Torah, I would think that LSD use would conflict with that particular rule.&nbsp; That being said, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a group of modern, neo-hasidic jews did actually use LSD as a religious tool.&nbsp; Pretty neat thought, but I&#039;ve never heard of it before now.

				the bal shem tov, the rabbi that started the hassidic movement was known to smoke a shit ton of opium. also, there is nothing in the old testament that directly says anything against drugs, if it comes from the ground and is natural, there is no issue with it.
