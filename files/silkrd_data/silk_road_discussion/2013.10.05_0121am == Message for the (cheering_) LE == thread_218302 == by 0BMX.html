				Some advice from your (old) colleagues:<br /><br />The war on drugs has unequivocally failed to meet a single one of its stated goals. We have bravely fought the war on drugs for more than 40 years – arresting, prosecuting, and imprisoning at ever-increasing levels. We have spent well over a trillion dollars and made more than 39 million arrests of nonviolent drug users...<br /><br />Ask yourself this simple question: Has it worked? As most of us can answer from experience: No. The war on drugs has never worked.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Observation and long experience have taught us that this is an unwinnable war. Prohibition is not a deterrent; never has been; never will be. Every time we put a drug kingpin away, a line of people are waiting to take his place. The illicit drug market is far too lucrative to be “arrested” away. It’s time to end this “war” and try another approach.<br /><br />Many of us have spent our entire careers risking our lives for the sake of the drug war. We have seen colleagues lose their lives in this struggle. We enforced the drug laws by arresting users and dealers alike. Though we know that most drug users aren’t violent – usually they just want to be left alone – the illegal drug trade is extraordinarily violent. Whether we’re working undercover or clearing dealers from street corners or responding to gang shootings, we put ourselves in harm’s way because we have been taught that damaging the drug trade will win this war and reduce its associated evils.<br /><br />...As those responsible for applying and interpreting the law, we observe on a daily basis how overly punitive drug policies have led to clogged courts and disrespect for the criminal justice system. Despite massive spending and positive intentions, we witness in our courtrooms the toll that even one drug charge can take on a person’s life. Losing a driver’s license, the ability to get a job, or the ability to get financial aid can seriously affect a person’s ability to reach their full potential, as well as undermining their family’s wellbeing. Mandatory minimums lead to unfair sentences that, as we know all too well, often do not fit the crime. We are forced to break up families and send children to foster care even in cases involving non-violent activity. Though it is not our job to create or change the law, it is our moral duty to speak out about a broken system and the need for a public debate to re-examine our failed drug policies.<br /><br />Join LEAP as an Official Law Enforcement Member<br />(For current or former members of law enforcement only.)<br />http://www.leap.cc/for-law-enforcement/lemember/<br /><br />An here&#039;s what I think.<br />How many more have to die, or get hurt, before you get the message? With your policy, you&#039;re not helping humanity, you bring humanity in danger!<br />So, thank you for destroying a save haven for users and sellers. <br />Thank you for disrupting peacefull demonstrations.<br />Thank you for stealing peoples money with useless fines and crazy rules. <br />Thank you for not arresting war criminals, corrupt bankers and policy makers.<br />Thank you for not protecting whistle-blowers and journalists.<br />Thank you for helping out the strong 1% and not the weak.<br />Thank you for your spying and your agressive behaviour on the harmless.<br />Thank you for helping out true criminals.<br />Thank you for keeping the status quo alive.<br />And thank you for a dozen other things.<br /><br />SO, THANK YOU FOR NOT TO SERVE AND PROTECT WHAT YOU SHOULD SERVE AND PROTECT!<br /><br />Maybe you&#039;ll see now why people self-medicate.<br />Don&#039;t think &#039;I&#039;m just doing my job&#039;, you don&#039;t. It&#039;s no wonder you get no love anymore. <br /><br />regards,<br />your conscience<br /><br />
