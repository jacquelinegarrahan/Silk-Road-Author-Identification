				Hello LE. Or whichever random modern sschmoe that in someway identifies themselves as being any kind of respectable authority. (Hint: the only respectable kind&nbsp; is self!)<br /><br />You are a dying breed. You will be rooted out by your own consciousness or face a rotting on the inside for the rest of your existence. Consciousness breeds only self gooverning. Self authority. And YOU. The man/woman/cunt behind the curtain... Laughing all the way to the bank. Are the worst kind of human expression. Likely incapable of understanding these concepts&nbsp; intrinsically anyway. So this isn&#039;t really for you.<br /><br />It&#039;s for the rest of &quot;us folk&quot; <br /><br />It&#039;s to remind the rest of us here that actually do positive things for the world and treat others with dignity and respect and a simple rule of: not fuckingmeddling in that which is none of your business! <br /><br />It&#039;s a reminder to&nbsp; those who are finding out how to live more in their heart than in their mind. That ego is the only real war going on. That we are of the same stuff. The same origin. That evil or sin is only the lack of consciousness and living in a dream where you are separate and live in fear. <br /><br />And what does LE fear? Well.... for first and foremost starters they fear not getting a paycheck. Since that&#039;s why they ruin lives. The system demands it. <br /><br />So LE.... why the fuck did I begin this thread? To remind you that you will regret being the worst part of human exisstence either in this life or next. That if you are actually believing that you are doing &quot;good&quot; that you can only hang onto that fairy tale for so long. Because you&nbsp; are human. <br /><br />Perhaps you were mistreated quite poorly as a youngster. Perhaps you did not get the right kind of love and nurture and it&#039;s so painful that you refuse to even acknowledge what your relatives and parents did to you when you were young. Especially if you are a woman. <br /><br />And mayybe.. just maybe. You&#039;ve realized what I&#039;m saying&nbsp; here for a long time. and you&#039;ve ignored your conscience entirely. That you only have a job or career in LE for your own method of survival. That you are as guilty as those you are paid to snuff out. That you don&#039;t actually mean to even truly snuff out the problem. For without the problem your industry falls. That you actually love the industry that allows you financial freedom and safety from the likes like yourself. It also strokes the fuck outta your already inflated ego. <br /><br />You just need a steady stream of bodies that are on the other side of your industry to keep making mistakes. <br /><br />But the masses are learning faster these days le :0) oh yea, you are the masses le. You probably have little to no clue the regime you actually support. The detriment to the human existence runs deep my brother or sister. And I hope you someday know that your ugliness inside spreads and infects the humans that would give you the shirt off their backs without hesitation. The so called &quot;criminals&quot; you persecute. <br /><br />Well you are the criminal my friend. In your misguided ways to control others. In your ways of oppressing others. In your own befuddled attempts at having a significance in this world. <br /><br />So for those of LE that want to do their own work towards actually creating a difference that supports life instead of stamps it out..... definitely try some psychedelics and/or ecstasy. That will allow for much deeper perspective on things. Opening. Transforming. But before that maybe some Qi Gong, Martial arts, yoga, or tai chi. Some meditation. Maybe seek out some therapy and figure out why you chose a life of hurting others and exerting your will over theirs. Recognize that your perception of the world is based on your circumstances, environment, and beliefs. A product of the system as a whole. And that&#039;s what has caused your particular perspective that acts in ways that hurts others. To think it&#039;s drug dealers that are hurting people, sorry... if you did not carry guns and place people in cages... well.... but of course you&#039;re just part of the system. You don&#039;t have any control over it. You are not part of the problem. It&#039;s criminals. Right. The vast majority of drug users and drug sellers being non violent people. <br /><br />And you&#039;re also a big fucking hypocrite. Since i bet you reading this right now use drugs every day. Smoking. Coffee. Maybe you or many of your friends and relatives use weed on a semi regular basis. Maybe your sister or nephew is into cocaine. <br /><br />Truth is you depend on drugs just like the rest of us here. It&#039;s a happy little game isn&#039;t it? And truth is... the regime you swear allegiance to, follow orders from, is the creator of this paradigm. From very early on. You are just as much a slave as we. It&#039;s your bosses, governing leaders,&nbsp; and predecessors of governed society that created this game of war. It&#039;s entirely on purpose. And your side will lose. Because it is one of deceit and indoctrination. A cage of minds. It can only last as long as you support the facade. And lie to yourself. Ignore your heart. That you even have one. <br /><br />How long can you do it? <br /><br />

				+1... I have wanted to write something like this for a long, long time, thank you. <br />I&#039;m not the intended recipient, but I gather that LE are some of our best customers, particularly in the steroid/weed/amphetamine/painkiller market.&nbsp; Good thing you suggested psychedelics, because&nbsp; &quot;A good narcotics officer should have narcotics in his blood!&quot;(Training Day.)&nbsp; There is an awakening going on right now, one that will make the 1960s look like the dark ages.&nbsp; &nbsp;The harder they squeeze, the harder we squeeze back, oozing through their fingers like cornstarch and water.&nbsp; For a while, in the late 90s, I could buy drugs on the street, quality drugs.&nbsp; The downside was, I had to hang out with people who were always in trouble.&nbsp; I often lament how these people risked everything to make sure I stayed high, of course, they had their own reasons for doing what they did, but they were my people.&nbsp; I remember a few years later, as my taste for drugs had changed, seeing a &quot;sweep&quot; in a poor neighborhood where minorities who spoke spanish lived, good people, who found themselves in a gang war, children with fathers in jail, mothers forced into workfare programs to keep their housing.&nbsp; &nbsp;There were hundreds of police, some in cars, some lined up outside of tenement stoops, ready to raid whoever might have a relative or friend in need staying illegally in their dwelling.&nbsp; Other police were in Armored Personnel Carriers, driving from block to block.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t score any drugs that day, but I left with a sick taste in my mouth.&nbsp; &nbsp;If we, the sellers and users of controlled substances, cannot eek out an existence on the street? what shall we do, well we built our own drug spot in the backwaters of a post-industrial network designed to withstand a nuclear bomb.&nbsp; We, the persecuted, those whose arrests climb every year, to satisfy the anti-drug industry, which has no intent of stamping out anything except for freedom.&nbsp; I applaud you for you audacity and brutal honesty.&nbsp; Most of all, I respect your view of LE as human beings, because somewhere deep down, they are.&nbsp; Let&#039;s help them find that part, so they can see the err of their ways!

I can&#039;t say what the drug user side post will spawn but I believe consciousness will carry through to all those sleepwalking the days away at some point. It&#039;s not a real hope that the kinds of ruthless freedom stampers who are really here on this forum will heed any of the sign posts I&#039;m pointing to. It&#039;s like trying to convince your brutally fucked up ex girlfriend that they are entirely deserving and worthy of good things and good relationships. Or your classic egotist/narcissistic billionaire that their hoarding of money only perpetuates the power of the very few and hurts societal awareness raising as a whole contributing to the whole place being utterly destroyed for future generations.<br /><br />And that there&#039;s any reason to fucking care. <br />And that is our deepest of natures. <br /><br />That love is who you are. That love is what you can create. By simply allowing. That fear and ego are our most difficult challenges and we can truly be healed by love in a day if we choose. Love lets go. Fear holds on for dear life. Love allows. Fear controls. Love stays open. Fear closes off. Love allows. Love gives. Love shares. And unfortunatelly we have all been duped at some point or another. Into believing untruths. Into indoctrination. Into domesticated and easily controlled humans. But as you said, a shift is occurring. And I&#039;m sure it has those actively participating in this life stage as LE quite fearful... their panties in a bunch if you will. Hopefully this inward shift spreads to the hearts of LE and gives hope to actual change and actual prosperity throughout this world. It&#039;s unfortunate there has to be so much pain spread until then. <br /><br /><br />I want to open some dialogue with LE. I&#039;m interested in those that are LE but have sseen at least a little light. I want to chat and explore with those closet drug using LE&#039;s. Cause cmon.... you know there&#039;s gotta be some LE&#039;s out there, ordering drugs on the road... and maybe one night... deciding their curiosity can&#039;t take it anymore and... they decide to smoke some DMT they recently acquired from a vendor on the road and see what all the fuss is about! I mean it sounds very doubtful but there&#039;s gotta be some noob rookie on the new road task force that decides to meddle in their &quot;own research&quot; at some point. The human spirit shows up wherever it might. <br /><br />Of course there are plenty plenty LE&#039;s on the street that do blow, or smoke weed that we just sometimes only hear about through friends regarding their own family who are cops and whatnot. And those fuckers probably have a shit inner experience being such pure hypocrites. I don&#039;t know... I&#039;m open to all suggestions to bridging the gap. <br /><br />And being an open minded open hearted thinker and caring deeply for all humans in their difficulty to fit inside the box their mind creates........ Being a way shower is my deepest passion. So I hope I can spark even the tiniest bit of contemplation and possibly some heart opening LE. Have you ever traveled outside your tiny little box home inside your head?

				I do believe that in time LE in the US will be like those Soviet military men in the 1990&#039;s realizing that their life was worthless and they ended up working for and being on the wrong side of history. I imagine such an existence to be rather depressing and discouraging especially for the moral ones who will undoubtedly feel great regret for putting so many people behind bars for such a long time over something history ultimately determines to be a great injustice. HOWEVER, I am not for antagonizing LE. They are not the judge nor the jury nor even the prosecution, but the prosecution listens to them greatly and you do not want to give LE a reason to take a special interest in you. LE also can play very very dirty and antagonizing them will just bring that side out of them (whereas if you are just another dumb schmuck they don&#039;t care about they are more likely to play by the rules). So I will not antagonize them here or if I get busted, I prefer letting my lawyers antagonize them :-)........ most are huge dirtbags though.

				Don&#039;t get me wrong.&nbsp; LE deserve a large share of criticism, in part because of their inability to enforce the law objectively, i.e. treating perps like dogshit (often on a sliding scale based on race/class) or breaking the same laws they are paid to enforce.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me started on the disappearing line between the War on Terror and the War on (Some) Drugs.<br /><br />But let&#039;s not forget those who make the laws.&nbsp; If all laws were truly just, LE would be held in much higher regard.<br /><br />Finally let&#039;s not forget those who influence those who make the laws.&nbsp; The lobbyists, bankers and corporatocrats.&nbsp; Who do you think fights the hardest against legalization?&nbsp; Cops?&nbsp; Congress?&nbsp; How about Altria, Pfizer and Coca-Cola?

				And let me just say a big Thank You to the whole here. Including ruthless agents however misguided. Enough of the masses are misguided as it is. We are all playing out this cosmic story of life. We are all significant. We all make up the experience of consciousness. We are all stardust. <br /><br />Without LE we wouldn&#039;t have this cute little place called the silk road.

				Good on you for voicing your frustration. I&#039;m assuming we are speaking of the Unites States of America. I&#039;ve got so much anger towards LE for the lack of respect they show to people. Arresting fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, daughters, son....and for reasons as foolish as they do. Now granted, I have met maybe 1 cop or so that knew the company he was with was wicked in many ways. That cop earned my respect in a way... I&#039;ll never be one of the people that &#039;understands&#039; why a dog gets shot for coming to his owners aid, or why a man getting out of his truck unarmed is left with dozens of holes in his body. I&#039;ll never be okay that my family fears LE because of how they treat society. We are a game to them. They wake up in the morning looking for the glasses half empty, when we are humans just trying to fill our cup. I find my anger for them grows every day. Yet this makes them happy, because they truly are a breed that is unstoppable. They can shoot people and get a weeks paid vacation. Many of you are right, one day they will hopefully wake up. Until then we will have to learn to play smarter than them, and KNOW OUR RIGHTS, practice them, and show our respect in order to keep our families and friends safe. My love to all of you and your families. <br /><br />Ryno

				&quot;One&#039;s condition on marijuana is always existential. One can feel the importance of each moment and how it is changing one. One feels one&#039;s being, one becomes aware of the enormous apparatus of nothingness -- the hum of a hi-fi set, the emptiness of a pointless interruption, one becomes aware of the war between each of us, how the nothingness in each of us seeks to attack the being of others, how our being in turn is attacked by the nothingness in others.&quot;<br />-Norman Mailer<br /><br />This really puts it into perspective.

				good cops bad cops i have met both sorts; and while cops are the proximate problem they are not the root cause. Cops in the main are people who see their job as enforcing law. But it is the law itself that is the problem. Here in the uk, we supposedly live in a democracy. But that is not really the case. sure you get to vote occasionally but whatever way you vote the outcome will be much the same. Like henry fords famous utterance, you can have any colour car you want so long as its black. Democracy and law are the same animal. No one on here, unless they belong to the government, has any input into the laws that we have to abide by. and so noone has any real democratic input. and that is much more the problem than the cops, altho if they are raping your dwelling, seizing your pc etc and locking you in cells it may not seem so. So is there some giant conspiracy to oppress society and take away our freedoms? its more likely that those who own this island, all act in the same way to protect their privileged position, they dont need to gather in secret cabals, altho doubtless there are some of those. no, they are acting simply out of self interest. and what is their self interest? principally that there should be no change in society. If you are a multi millionaire and on top of the heap any change can only be to your disadvantage. And drugs are anathema to them because drugs may make you change your mind and start trying to make changes in society. the wars that our leaders are so keen on are an external manifestation of all this; they are protecting the rich and powerful, not us. wars protect the corporate right to rape third world resources for instance, and as a byproduct kill a lot of dissenters. the uk is a police state; viz greenwalds partner and the state thugs who detained him for 9 hours and seized all his comms equipment. He was innocent. But it made no difference. Political change is the only thing that will help but where thats coming from god knows. Go snowden, go uruguay, go sr&nbsp; love to you all

				Fighting for peace makes as much sense as fucking for virginity. That is what I told my recruiter after I scored in the top 98th% of those that take the ASVAB.( Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery).<br /><br />The human species is wired to respond to threats with just a few limited responses, physiologically. Fight or flight brought to you by your autonomic nervous system. When one has mastered the fear response, the anger response, and can choose how to react, then one is free. <br /><br />Remember folks, all of this is done by choice. Whether to be afraid of those that are different, or to welcome them with curiosity. We are all capable of choosing not to cause harm deliberately. LEO&#039;s have chosen to cause harm, with deliberate and malicious intent to cause harm to the other members of their species, when they are honest with themselves. <br /><br />The marks of how healthy a society is are by how they treat their elderly, their young, their disabled, and especially, their animals. <br /><br />Think about this, humans are the only species that violates its young sexually before sexual maturity. Yet, for the powers that be, they are frequently the most egregious offenders of human rights. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. <br /><br />When we have transcended the boundaries of our physiology, and can access and unlock the potentials of the human mind, those psi powers like telepathy, we will then no longer be able to violate the other inhabitants of this wonderful rock hurtling through space. <br /><br />Its kinda hard to rape when they are screaming in your head, stop. It will be even more difficult to eat those animals for food when our empathic senses are awakened to their suffering. Now take LE. Will be obsolete as our species evolves and embraces the mental psi powers that is our species&#039; birthright. <br /><br />I may sound like I am wearing a tinfoil hat, so be it. Micro tubules communicate how? The law of quantum entanglement is revealing we are all connected.
