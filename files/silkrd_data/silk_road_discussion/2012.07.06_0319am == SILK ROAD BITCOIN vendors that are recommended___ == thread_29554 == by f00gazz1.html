				I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll find that many veteran members here will recommend a bitcoin vendor. No matter how trusted they get, it can be so damn easy to just walk away. You&#039;re also going to get absolutely gouged by fees (there are rare exceptions) to the point that you should just use bitinstant.com. It can be faster than the bitcoin vendors on here, it is almost always cheaper, and it is definitely safer. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br /><br />That guide should help you a bunch.

				Vlad1m1r is probably the go to guy for UK/EU purchases.<br /><br />If you are in the US you could try Blue Sky traders however i would not suggest dropping 500 on one vendor your first time.

				I used BTC Buddy for my last large exchange (&gt; $500), I got my BTC in about an hour and the rates were very fair.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3ade97b152<br /><br />Z

If you gunna run them through bank accounts you have to know what you are doing when it comes to turning them legit and half the time turning them legit isn&#039;t where they come from, that&#039;s easy, it&#039;s where they end up after you sold them for real money.

				Ugh, did a bank transfer to intersango today but am running the coins through bitcoinfog - forgot that police can arrest/prosecute you even on receiving drugs in the mail in the UK (got this info from vladm1r), let alone the fact my bank account will have &quot;Transfer to Intersango LTD&quot; today. <br /><br />

				BTCpal<br />pakupaku<br />Sugar Mama<br /><br />I&#039;ve done moneypak to bitcoin exchanges with all three of these vendors and can vouch for their legitimacy.&nbsp; Though, Sugar Mama has a higher fee than the other two
