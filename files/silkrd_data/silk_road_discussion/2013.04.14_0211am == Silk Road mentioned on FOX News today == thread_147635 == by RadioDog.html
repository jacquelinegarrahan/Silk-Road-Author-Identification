				Not sure if anyone else saw this, but I got stuck watching FOX News today in a waiting room and they were discussing the current bitcoin fluctuations and they brought up SR! It was actually pretty hysterical, they said something along the lines of &quot;The notorious hacker website Silk Road uses bitcoins to sell illegal guns and drugs over the internet.&quot; - Not an exact quote, and I can&#039;t find any video of it on youtube or anything but it just aired today a few hours ago so someone might upload it eventually. I literally laughed out loud when I heard them say &quot;notorious hacker website.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Peace.

				<br />Actually you know, despite what people say about Fox News (in surveys a huge part of the viewership is liberal for some reason) a fair number of conservatives, maybe even a majority don&#039;t have a problem with SR. I mean they think it&#039;s very naughty, but they get the concept when they hear it. A good part of that is that lots of them have had it with the Drug War. I mean even Pat Robertson thinks it&#039;s a waste of time. You have to give him credit, he changed his mind. I don&#039;t think, despite the stereotype, that left wing conservatives are any more likely to change their minds than right wing conservatives, I&#039;d say they&#039;re about the same, it&#039;s just the issues change.<br /><br />The members of the public who have a problem with SR are the &quot;outraged classes&quot;. These are the outrage junkies, &quot;think of the children&quot; types. Some people have a legitimate beef with the illegal drug trade and I think Darknet markets could actually compromise with these people on a range of issues such as quality control, black listed addresses and potentially age/maturity hurdles if we had a rational discussion, but few of those people act like outrage junkies. Outrage junkies predominately seem to come from the middle class, middle aged &quot;rebel without a cause&quot; type of person. There isn&#039;t that many of them, but they make a lot of noise. Frankly they&#039;re embarrassing and ignorant people whatever &#039;single issue&#039; they&#039;re into. Basically they throw tantrums to get their way, something most mature people quit as teens.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s increasingly obvious that the Drug War is being fought without a democratic mandate, and that it&#039;s a war waged for and by a special interest segment of society.<br /><br />However I&#039;m not sure this awareness genuinely changes anything. The Drug War never was about democracy in the first place, no prohibition was ever democratically voted into place. So undoing such a thing isn&#039;t necessarily a democratic process either. It&#039;s not a popular opinion, but legalizing drugs may only change the special interest segment from one area to another, many pro-legalization people haven&#039;t fully thought it through. If you wind up establishing government monopolies, not a lot is going to change from the current situation, you&#039;ll still have ourselves and people in prisons for &quot;counterfeiting&quot;.<br /><br />I mean look at Obama, our &#039;liberal&#039;. He makes Dubya look like a libertarian on most policies. Obama is the most conservative Democratic that&#039;s been in power for a long long time, but this seems to slip under some people&#039;s radar for some reason. I&#039;m not a Republican, I think they&#039;re as bad as each other from my perspective, but it just blows my mind that some people still give Obama the benefit of the doubt, they&#039;re not being consistent with their ethics.

				FOX news, like most conglomerates, delivers the news as they see fit , not necessarily the facts or the truth. It&#039;s called INFO-TAINMENT. It&#039;s a commercial enterprise and their bottom line is all that matters. They won&#039;t let&nbsp; facts get in the way of a good story. <br /><br />The so called &quot;War on drugs&quot; is a manufactured ambiguity. The CIA, in the 60&#039;s were involved in the distribution of LSD to U.S. college campuses for purposes of mind control (MKULTRA) to quell radical ideology and unrest. (Vietnam war) The CIA tried to order a ton of acid from Swiss pharma Hoffmman LaRoche but they couldn&#039;t make it fast enough.<br /><br />Fast forward...... 80&#039;s-90&#039;s,&nbsp; Manuel Noriega, CIA asset. All that GOOD coke that flooded the U.S. came in with a wink and a nod. Tons came in at an AFB in Arkansas. Thanks, Gov. Clinton. CIA used all those Narco-dollars to fund Black-Op&#039;s projects which will remain classified indefinitely. and if it is declassified, it&#039;s heavily redacted. <br /><br />It&#039;s not about Democrats, Republicans Conservatives, Liberals..........It&#039;s all the same stench. The plot is to keep the average Joe in a derisive state of illusion......a shell game. Add to that the Zionist Jews in Hollywood who excel at keeping the masses sedated and dumbed down, while reaping millions.<br /><br />Time to wake up!

				MaxieBB got it right, the mainstream-dinosaur media is nothing but a distraction, most people dont even watch it anymore, i think its becoming well known that the internet is a much better source of information. The news wants to pick and choose what they want you to think instead of just presenting the news, they are kings of spin controlled by none other than the global elite. Who (obviously) dont want silkroad or bitcoin or anything that allows us to be free to exist, and they will do anything they have to in order to indoctrinate the population and spread their disinformation. Its all about control, they know were not hackers, some of us sell things while some of us buy them, its called FREE WILL, yet they want to eliminate free will. Fuck fox news and everyother mainstream news channel its all pure bullshit.

Honestly I doubt most of his most ardent supporters know his policies in any sort of depth, but that doesn&#039;t matter, what it&#039;s about is image. His image is that of a cool laid back liberal, which is helped by being black. That&#039;s what these die hards are voting for. They couldn&#039;t care less about drone strikes/guantanamo/NDAA/drug war/corporate money in politics. Obama is the cool black guy and the republicans are the old crusty white guys. That&#039;s the level at which many people perceive it.<br /><br />I mean do you remember that whole hope and change crock of shit? What&#039;s changed? Seriously. It&#039;s absolutely hilarious that so many people believed in that. Watching that as an outsider to America was really interesting, how much people got into it, and then forgot it immediately. It&#039;s honestly like it never happened.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what Obama&#039;s up to, if he has any actual values, or if he&#039;s just a corporate puppet with some nefarious intentions. In his interviews he seems like a very glib and swift falsifier, a twister of language, and something about him just doesn&#039;t sit right with me. He seems like what a liar would come across as if they were trying to come across as open. I know what an open person looks like, and he is the exact opposite.<br /><br />With someone like David Cameron, it&#039;s obvious that the guy is a shill, and not a very competent one at that. The guy is basically a bumbling moron that has spent the last 25 years trying to hide his not so latent bisexuality with a comb-over and a clean shave every morning. With Obama, he&#039;s more intelligent, which is perplexing, because let&#039;s face it his intentions are opaque as fuck.

				The less publicity SR gets from the general public, the better. It should be only for those who are competent, intelligent, empowered and responsible. This will only encourage LE/GOV to look into the site, and encourage 12 year old teeny-boppers to get all manner of shit shipped to their parent&#039;s house.

				Silk Road is a major threat to our country and our children making over priced narcotics available to all the addicts who like to wait 1-12 weeks for their drugs to arrive. Forget about the low level street dealers.
