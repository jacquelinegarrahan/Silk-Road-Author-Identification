				CLEARNET WARNING<br /><br />http://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2012/jun/08/hunting-child-porn-fbi-stymied-tor-undernet/<br /><br />they cant do shit through the technology, so&nbsp; yea there are probably alot of agents here forming networks and trying social networking and such attempts, so buyers beware. Thing is the feds dontgive a shit about the guy buying a bag for personal use. They want the sellers, so IMO beware of anyone only selling large where they can get you for possession with intent to deliver or tafficking amounts.

				This is more an American buyers &#039;thing&#039; as in the UK and other European nations the people buying are not so concerned about buying small amounts.<br /><br />We don&#039;t have &#039;feds&#039; in the UK. Even if some youth call the cops the feds! We have drug &#039;squads&#039; and its very rare for cops to pose as sellers just to bust the small fish. <br /><br />We had a few &#039;Silk Road - the darknet&#039; new articles but most people do not care about drug websites. They just want the child porn ones becoming top targets for ALL LEA.<br /><br />With SR I guess police or other agencies can pose as sellers. One trick is to announce a new vending operation dealing in bulk only. you will have people here message that they would take 100 grams or a kilo. The samples are sent out. How many people will send an address to a stranger for a sample? <br /><br />BTC could not taken out as there is definitive legal argument to prove it was ever created so that people could buy drugs.<br /><br />Is BTC used by some to buy drugs? Yes. But so is real money and I think every note in the USA has traces of coke on it. <br /><br />Sellers here are at risk. They can be taken down but with some hard work. Samples will be bought. Packaging noted. Some vendors have excellent business envelopes for example but why send out thousands all the same when you could easily keep swapping over? Some vendors stand out as blending in with business mail outs which are the least likely to be flagged as suspicious and the most common. The cops only need locate the area goods are posted from. If they found a vendors &#039;style&#039; envelope appearing in a certain postcode then a simple obs op would find someone posting those envelopes.<br /><br />Some vendors here are teams so in the USA or any nation pressure is applied and some will fold and inform on their co workers. They will rat them out for reduced sentences.<br /><br />One man or women vendors are safest. As long as you change the method of posting often then its hard to spot your mail in the hundreds of millions of other mailings. If you change the package for business type mail outs every day then you are safe from what seems to me to be an easy way to get at some vendors here.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had buys off vendors using the same business style mail out for months. <br /><br />Its so easy to change a logo and company that it seems to me that vendors ought to maybe think about this.<br /><br />Oh, forensics these days! One hair and your down! <br /><br />Definition of a dumb vendor is one who licks his or her own envelopes.<br /><br />Laters&nbsp; ;D

				I find it hard to believe that the FBI can&#039;t trace Tor hidden services when there are technical documents on how to do it. that either says a lot about how completely unskilled they are from a technical point of view, or is intentionally misleading information being fed to the media. It is true that they probably can not quickly trace most clients though.

				The FBI is totally useless in this situation.&nbsp; Who is to say the people running this place are even in the USA?&nbsp; They can have an informant gathering info all they want, it still doesn&#039;t do a damn thing.&nbsp; This is a place that is accessed ALL OVER THE WORLD, and I guarantee this place isn&#039;t even being run by anybody in the US.&nbsp; This is the internet, people.&nbsp; They can bring on all the informants and try their best to shut this place down.&nbsp; But as long as all the admins and people running this place play it smart, the worst that can be done is packages get intercepted, which only puts some of the buyers and sellers at risk.&nbsp; Not the admins.&nbsp; Lol.&nbsp; Long live Silk Road.&nbsp; And as I&#039;ve said already, if Silk Road is shut down, 10 more will pop up.<br /><br />And honestly, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if this place was actually run by the government or government officials.&nbsp; Keeps them completely anonymous, and they make bank off the commission from every purchase.&nbsp; In fact, I don&#039;t see how the people running this could get away with all that money they&#039;re making off this place without some sort of insider within the government (I don&#039;t know which government) helping them or the government itself just running this place.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m no expert on any of this, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not making the best of sense here, but it&#039;s my theory.&nbsp;

				LOL this place doesn&#039;t make enough money for it to be worth a Government conspiracy mate (no offence there DPR if you are watchin). If you look at the most memorable the U.S gov has dealt drugs it was Bing with the Contras and that was 100s of Mils, whilst this place earns a lot it isn&#039;t close to that because that worth more than the BTC economy itself. <br /><br />The MOST the FBI will have is maybe a couple of vendors they have clocked, raided and turned. If they had someone actually related to DPR or friends with him IRL the site would be GONE now. Think about this: This denial of the FOI thing getting out would have ALERTED DPR/THE STAFF/THE MODS/THE VENDORS/SANTA/JESUS/BUDDHA/FREE WILLY and the law wouldn&#039;t have allowed that massive red flag to go and not be forced to act IF THEY COULD because if they didn&#039;t it just gives DPR and co the time to get the fuck out of Dodge. Those threads on that chat host thing is just a couple of bitches getting excited because they (for some unknown reason) seem to have taken a grief out against SR so they just jumped to conclusions. <br /><br />Use your common sense people, the LOAF that you were born with. DPR is the ultimate prize for the law, the law ain&#039;t just gunna say &quot;Oh yeah we got informants&quot;, let DPR hear it and then let him 0800-2-1-do-one. Jesus Christ nobody is that dumb. They&#039;d have snatched him by now if they had someone that close. <br /><br />Chill the fuck out and rack up a line, sounds like some people need one!

It doesn&#039;t possess anything that the U.S government or any other government wants. It&#039;s not like the Contras that were fighting the commies who were the enemy at the time or something like that. <br /><br />I think people put too much meaning on what SR is. Yes, it&#039;s a revolutionary thing and it does make the best case so far for reforming drug law, and showing that drug-dealers can self-regulate but that so far is all. Thinking that it has some sort of invisible all-reaching power is just silly. I&#039;m not saying SR couldn&#039;t evolve to to be more than what it is at the moment, of course it could and I hope it does but thinking 400KBTC is a lot of money and thinking the CIA or some other government agency would get out of bed for that much or need SR in any way is pretty naive. <br /><br />FUCK TRIPPYSKIES! YOU HAVE LET THE CAT OUT THE BAG!!!! That&#039;s why they needed a British Mod you see, because they need someone who could translate Blair-Bullshit to the Americans.&nbsp; :P

				I&#039;m no IT genius but I have spent a lot of time learning not to be fooled by misinformation. I&#039;m not even going to read the OP, just state a thing that came to me and see how it flies.<br /><br />We know that as much malware if not most isn&#039;t meant to do more than put your puter in standby for botnet formation, at least I think we know that.<br />We know that it is rumored a certain alphabet agency has accomplished breaking PGP, which is designed, like all security measures, to be more trouble, or costly, that it is worth to defeat.<br />We know a huge data collection facility is being built that could supply the resources necessary, but supposedly isn&#039;t active yet.<br />We know from the Wikileaks/Anomous/HPGary Federal drama that that the DOD is connected to someone who installs rootkits and supposedly has designed a totally untraceable one. He also is supposedly Mr Social Networking, though that brag didn&#039;t work out well for him if we are to believe the word on the news.<br />One of their best customers, before they got pwnd LOL was the US government.<br />We know cloud computing is approaching a level of technology that could grant the admin of a huge botnet, or net of huge botnets, the resources, paid for by us but unlike taxation, this time voluntarily when we buy computers, the capability to command vast resources on the cheap, making the data center look like a misdirection if true.<br /><br />Just sayin....

				Wow. Just wow. I often wonder how many vendors are law. One of my favorite has been &#039;sick&#039; for a month, and now has &#039;someone else&#039; running the show. I soooo want to order, but I don&#039;t know if he got busted, and it&#039;s now law running his page for addy collection, or what. I decide to wait and see what happens. And in my world, that means nothing will happen, but when I decide to order, it won&#039;t be there. And if I do decide to order, I&#039;ll get busted. <br />As far as movies go, my brother and I have already been working on a script for 6 months, now. But, it is also open to many interpretations. It could be a movie with 20 alternative endings, beginnings, and plots. It could be 20 movies. fuck off Mr. Potter. <br /><br />People being busted? Well, Mars Volta (or similar moniker) posted a month or two ago about being busted, and never made another post after. <br />If anyone else was busted, how would they let us know? They don&#039;t give you internet access in jail or prison, especially don&#039;t let you have your usb drive to load up the darknet......so how would we know of they were busted,or just quit coming here?

				Actually it would be a good idea for every tech savvy vendor to have a tails stick and a sum of cash with a lawyer or very trusted and somewhat invisible friend.<br />Instructions= should I be arrested take the cash, by a netbook and install flashdrive and boot.<br />Script runs and posts pre-copied (no private keys on stick) pgp signed message to the forums, not main site of course.

				I have a friend who I gave a flash drive with 2 text files on it. One is a message encrypted with the key of someone here that I trust, and the other just has that trusted person&#039;s email address. He has no idea why, but he knows that if I turn up missing he needs to email the encrypted file to the address in the second file from a fresh email at a coffee shop. the encrypted file has the keys to my bitcoin wallets, pecunix accounts, logins for every board I am on, and everything he would need to locate me in the system (true identity). I hope he never has to send that email, but I a plan in place for worst case scenario.
