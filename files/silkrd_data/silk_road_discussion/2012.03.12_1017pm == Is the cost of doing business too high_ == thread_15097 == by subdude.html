				Anyone that thinks the price of doing business is too high will not be here. <br /><br />Looks like there are plenty of people that do not think the price of business it too high.<br /><br />It always varies, depending on what your selling, if you are middle man or source, ect., ect.<br />

				SR? No.<br /><br />But the associated or indirect costs outside of the SR can be significant. It takes considerable time and effort to be truly anonymous if you&#039;re a vendor.<br /><br />Still, it beats the crap out of paying taxes.

				- surely there&#039;s a difference between domestic and international orders?!<br /><br />{wholesale subs cost + postage &amp; packaging overhead (per order)<br />&nbsp; time spent running around IRL Versus packing, reading msg&#039;s and the forum etc?!}<br /><br />&nbsp;???<br /><br />edit:vendor model obviously differs, depends on whats being sold, upfront investment which determines how quickly need to reclaw cash and buy more means lowers<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yours cost per unit / gram / sheet etc..<br />&nbsp;

				Wow, thanks for explaining your post. It&#039;s really clear what you are talking about.<br /><br />But, I would say that the cost isn&#039;t high enough. I see many people who sell their product entirely too cheap, considering that what you are selling can land you in prison for a long time, and they have to deal with people who aren&#039;t the most upstanding citizens in their communities. Silkroad throws another wrench into the cogs, because now there is potentially a paper trail, so the alternative is Bitcoins, and you are at risk of a loss due to the fluctuation of the exchange rate, and they have to screw around and wait 3-5 business days every time they want to get their money.<br /><br />Basically, if you are trying to sell on silkroad, and you are not making enough money, then either raise your prices, or quit selling because you aren&#039;t good enough. People freak when I say raise your prices, but competition in markets is good, and with something like illegal drugs, it&#039;s a seller&#039;s market, which means the seller sets the prices, not the buyer.

As long as there are enough buyers from regions where certain drugs are expensive, you won&#039;t see a lower price here.<br /><br />For instance: in NL street coke goes for 50 euro/g (about 65 usd), higher quality will up the price. Here on SR I pay only slightly more (but I do get better quality) - so I&#039;m quite happy with the coke prices. On the other hand I will never buy MDMA on SR. 50 usd/g is overpriced, as I source high quality MDMA locally for 25 eur/g (30 usd).

I think even people on the street aren&#039;t charging enough for their drugs. Some of them are, but some definitely aren&#039;t. When you take into consideration the risk involved and the demand for certain drugs, the price should be much higher than it is.<br /><br />For example, some people on the street are still charging $100 per gram for methamphetamine, and that&#039;s how much it cost 20 years ago!! Yeah, I think considering inflation, demand, and the new penalties involved, it should be at least double that. This has caused so many buyers who aren&#039;t connected to the source to expect to get it at $100 per gram, hell, you are probably one of them. One gram of meth should last someone days, and maybe even over a week. Charging $100 per gram for it makes some people think that they could go through a gram in a day or two, which is insane, yet we see it happen time and time again! Not only a waste of good drugs, but very dangerous for the person.

				Well said my friend - I have been putting out feelers on another thread for people interested in investing their Bitcoin earnings but response has been lukewarm to say the least. I work for a Hedge Funds company and we avoid currency fluctuations by spreading investments over a basket of currencies, a significant portion of which are sunk into tangible assets. (This obviously is nothing new and many e-Currencies do the same - google &quot;Ven&quot;)<br /><br />It would seem however the criminal underworld are happy to live free now and not have a care for the future. Of course I suppose any dealers interested in cashing in could just withdraw 100K into a briefcase and keep it under their bed but it sounds like a rather stressful way to spend your Twilight years!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15097.msg173314#msg173314">Quote from: kidx on April 02, 2012, 02:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15097.msg172652#msg172652">Quote from: vlad1m1r on April 01, 2012, 06:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">The Bitcoin is a powerful tool for buyers to retain anonymity but I am finding it very difficult to work with as an investment tool as I&#039;d like to offer clients guaranteed returns on their investment and the coins are simply too volatile.

				To kidx, what in THE f*ck are you talking about? You play this game knowing the consequences. What the game is worth to one person, may not be worth it to another person.<br /><br />Supply and demand, dictates what one can charge and what one cannot charge. Lower to middle class clientele have a particular threshold, and normally value quantity over quality and are more price sensitive. Upper middle class to wealthy, customarily, want the best. Money is not an issue, but convenience and quality is.<br /><br />I say that to say, you know the risks of this game when you enter. Even though one has participated, no amount of money is logically worth the risk...just something you can live with. Honestly, IRL, unless you are in this game to make no profit until you can get 10 grand for an attorney, it is not for you. 90% of cats don&#039;t make 10 grand in this game before it is game over. But even if you could make double, triple or quintuple that, it still isn&#039;t &quot;worth&quot; it because you can&#039;t spend your money while you are incarcerated.<br /><br />It just comes down to not giving a single f*ck, loving the facade of freedom while dealing, and living the life how you want under the radar.

Supply and demand aren&#039;t some foreign concept to me. <br /><br />It&#039;s just my opinion that a lot of people aren&#039;t charging enough for their drugs. I actually do have good cause to believe that through my experience, and certainly I&#039;m entitled to my opinion.<br /><br />I think that there are too many &quot;middle men&quot; dealers who aren&#039;t as business savvy or connected, and sometimes they are impulsive, so many of their decisions aren&#039;t the best ones. Many people, for instance, are perfectly happy to sell drugs just so that they get their own drugs for free. So, their addiction is the driving factor, not profiting in any other way.<br /><br />There are also those who are simply drawn to it because they want to be a part of a underground drug culture. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve met certain people who use drugs as a way of attracting women, so it&#039;s kind of like that. Their motivation isn&#039;t monetary gain at all, and they&#039;ll take a loss just so that they can feel cool.<br /><br />Last, I think there are too many people trying to sell drugs that can&#039;t or won&#039;t sell to people who are willing to pay higher prices. They sell to only one demographic, so they think that what they are selling it for is the market rate, but that&#039;s untrue when there&#039;s a market of individuals demanding the product that don&#039;t have access to it. Many people with money are either too afraid or don&#039;t want to deal with some of these shady, scumbag dealers, and when some of them do they end up getting robbed or taken advantage of. If you have the ability to tap into that market you can easily double the price of what you now feel is the market rate.<br /><br />It&#039;s cool, though. You do what you do, and I&#039;ll do what I do. <br /><br />I know this: I ain&#039;t talking about no bullshit 10 grand, that&#039;s for sure...start adding zeroes to that figure, and maybe your will start to think that it&#039;s worth the risk.

				You know what, I totally agree with your last response.<br /><br />I was not able to glean that from your first few responses but you absolutely correct about the seller types.<br /><br />Did this sh!t as a business.

Usually when I get those kind of results on a search, and since they are both e-currency, I assume it would be feasible to convert them. I should have been more clear.. I may have mispoken.. it&#039;s the &quot;idea&quot; that&#039;s simple.. run a currency swap then hold the result. (I have *NOT* tried this personally yet FWIW.)<br />&nbsp;This possibly? https://wm-center.com/rates.php?type=exch<br /><br />&nbsp;As opposed to trying to execute a complex stock strategy or pick a good hedge fund. Vladimir talks like he is pro or semi-pro at the investment game. Swapping bitcoin to pecunix (or dollars to yen etc.) would be a pretty simple idea to a financial pro.<br /><br />&nbsp;Might be a complicated bitch to a simple fungi farmer like myself though.. but I love gold. It&#039;s understandable. I mistrust exotic financial instruments concocted by people just as smart as me who spent their lives learning investment banking rather than.. er.. what I mispent my youth learning!).

				Hi Philter,<br /><br />Thanks for your message. <br /><br />To answer your question why it isn&#039;t a good idea to leave a large portion of your profits as Bitcoins I&#039;d have to say that they have no inherent value in and of themselves and the value attributed to them by those who trade on SR for example is constantly up and down. That doesn&#039;t mean to say you can&#039;t profit from the Bitcoin directly, for example by buying them from one exchange for a certain price then selling them in another - or indeed simply buying a shed load of them and waiting until they appreciate in value but in my opinion it smacks too much of throwing one&#039;s eggs in one basket.<br /><br />You&#039;re absolutely right in saying that it would make sense to convert Bitcoins to another e-currency such as Pecunix or to precious metals but there are fees involved in so doing and even if you end up with a neat stack of gold bars under your bed, it&#039;s a far cry from that to nicely laundered funds sitting in a bank account in your name which you can use towards improving your lifestyle and/or a comfortable retirement.<br /><br />I joined SR as I realised that decent and successful vendors could well be sitting on a mountain of Bitcoins, the value of which could fall away any second - withdrawing the money as cash/bullion attracts hefty fees and also draws suspicion to them. In my view what&#039;s needed is a way to invest Bitcoins and receive it as cash plus interest in regular instalments into one&#039;s bank account.<br /><br />Would love to hear all your thoughts on this.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15097.msg175933#msg175933">Quote from: philter3 on April 03, 2012, 10:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15097.msg173961#msg173961">Quote from: vlad1m1r on April 02, 2012, 04:11 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Well said my friend - I have been putting out feelers on another thread for people interested in investing their Bitcoin earnings but response has been lukewarm to say the least.
