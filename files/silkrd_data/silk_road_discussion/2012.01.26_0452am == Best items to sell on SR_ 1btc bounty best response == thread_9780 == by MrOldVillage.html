				I want to know what kinds of things are easy to get in the US that are profitable to sell on here, as it seems that SR prices are very high.&nbsp; For example, I can get my psychiatrist to write me for 80mg of Adderall/day, costing me $50/month under insurance, and sell it for ~$1000 on here.&nbsp; That profit margin makes me want to sell drugs on here, given the seller protection that bitcoin and SR provide, even though I have never sold them before.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anything about how the prescription system works though.&nbsp; Can I go to a few different doctors and get Adderall from all of them?&nbsp; What other medications should I look into getting prescribed?&nbsp; What else should I look into selling? I&#039;m new at this so I&#039;ll send 1 bitcoin to whoever helps me out the most.

				Yes it&#039;s called doctor shopping. You can use google for more info but basically you just go around to different clinics and try and get them to write you a prescription. This will only work if you are in a state that doesn&#039;t track what doctors you go to. In addition to Adderall I would also try and get Ritalin. The big money makers in pharmaceuticals are definitely Oxycodone. If you could get a nice script of 30mg Oxycodone and break into the market with a competitive price you will be sold out in no time. If you do it right you will have loyal customers willing to buy more and more.

				Interesting.<br /><br />A friend of mine was saying that his meds cost 3.50 - 7 GBP while costing him 80 - 120 GBP in his previous home.<br /><br />So long as you evade detection it could certainly be a good earner. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some caveats there somewhere.

				Any pharmaceutical opiate would make you a killing on here. Pretty much every single one of them sells for at least a dollar a miligram, some even several dollars a miligram. However, it is not very plausible that you get prescribed something like this without a real ailment. (Except perhaps hydrocodone)

				Ok, here&#039;s what I think, you live in one of the cheapest countries for weed, if you buy in bulk (Say a pound) You can sell that on on SR. 1 Pound is 16 ounces, and I can assure you if you sell an ounce for around (As of now) 30BTC or less, you&#039;ll attract loads of customers!<br /><br />Btw, you&#039;ll save money the bigger amount you buy to sell on, but don&#039;t buy too much!<br />-Craddy

				I would buy opium like a shot. The problem with opium is it&#039;s hard to get, and once you start selling it you&#039;re almost certainly going to get bad feedback from noobs who buy it expecting it to catapult them into outerspace, and then complain when it doesn&#039;t hit them like smack would.

				the best options already named such as Adderal,Benzos,MDMA and Weed<br /><br />since you already has adderal prescribed you have a really good start with selling them<br /><br />yes its possible to go to various Docs its not difficult i have make them 2 years ago (4 different docs), you will have a shitload adderal for sale.<br /><br />when you have builded enough trust i would begin in selling weed since you live in a good countrie for weed you should also make an good profit and can sell them at good prices.<br /><br />at this step you should have already an excellent rep when you make these 2 steps professional.<br /><br />After that i would looking in buy good bulk MDMA/Amphe/Benzos (Xanax,Lorazepam,) <br />especially such as Rohpynol,Opium,Oxys<br /><br /><br />and it should run nice <br /><br />be sure you have an secure PC and use PGP and such things <br /><br /><br />regards

				OK, I submit this as the (hopefully) winning response.<br />After browsing all of the threads, I believe that the absolute best product you could sell would be.....bitcoins.<br /><br />Think about it.. there are only 2 or 3 reputable vendors offering bitcoins for moneypacs.&nbsp; They are reputable ..but there is room for more competition in this area.&nbsp; <br />Making 10% on every transaction isn&#039;t bad for a low risk operation<br /><br />Here are the reasons bitcoins would be a good product<br />1.&nbsp; Its legal.&nbsp; &nbsp;This eliminates the risk you take with&nbsp; any illegal products.<br />2.&nbsp; Demand is high.&nbsp; All of the newbies that are looking to quickly acquire bitcoins.&nbsp; <br />3.&nbsp; Profit is high.&nbsp; Looks like the sellers are making at least 10% per transaction.&nbsp; <br />4.&nbsp; Its faster than any other product.&nbsp; With any other product, you have to pack and ship and it takes several days and then the buyer has to finalize.&nbsp; With the bitcoin business you can complete the transaction and you have your profit quickly.<br /><br />I&#039;m a relatively new member but I was thinking that this could be a lucritive business.&nbsp; <br />OF course, I know others might disagree but this is my suggestion for best product.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				Ok we are getting closer to a winner here now:)&nbsp; several people have mentioned doctor shopping and I feel I need more info on how to do this without getting caught.&nbsp; Is it best to have the doctors in different states?&nbsp; How bad is it to get caught?<br /><br />I know a lot about bitcoins and how to launder them, but I don&#039;t know a lot about moneypaks (or ukash/paysafecards for UK people).&nbsp; How would I go about converting these?

				Selling btc could be profitable. Even better is selling btc and selling stuff to buy with them. You can make money twice from the same sale. <br /><br />High mg IR prescription stimulants and opiates are easy money makers. <br /><br />If you cook the drug or grow the weed yourself illegals can be worthwhile. Then it&#039;s all profit minus materials and electricity. <br /><br />It&#039;s a pain in the ass exchanging MP I&#039;ve heard. There are limits in place to keep people from laundering money. Accounts have maximums on how many MP&#039;s and how much money you can deposit. BTCKing said they are using in person bank deposits now instead of MP&#039;s. <br /><br />SR could setup some kind of btc trading system to help folks out. Vendors have btc and want cash while customers have cash and want btc. Vendors could put some btc into an account and customers could deposit money into another account. Then they could each access the funds they want quickly, easily, and safely through SR. The vendor&#039;s and customer&#039;s transactions would only be known by the account holder and SR. It would be a lot of work and hassle to get going and I guess SR doesn&#039;t want to deal with it.<br /><br /><br />

				Get a wholesale account with companies which sell products the dealers need.&nbsp; Capsules, low permeability bags, vacuum sealer supplies, pill binders, etc.&nbsp; Everyone needs this stuff, nobody wants a transaction history.&nbsp; You have to be able to buy low and sell low however, so a legitimate wholesale account or importing from overseas is a good start.&nbsp; Sure, anyone can buy capsules in bulk cheap on Amazon, but that&#039;s easily obtained evidence for any future criminal trial and probably good enough grounds for a search warrant in many places.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in a country which doesn&#039;t scrutinize mail so heavily, become a remailer service for people in disadvantaged countries like the NL.

				I was getting oxycontin 30mgs prescribed and they started making them abuse proof so u can&#039;t cut them up &amp; sniff them like a lot of people I knew liked to do. So nobody wanted them anymore. Even swallowing them seemed less potent.<br />If u tried sniffing them, they turn to wax and clog nose. I only ever swallowed them for pain so i didnt care but I thought selling them would be less rewarding now unless they want to swallow them.
