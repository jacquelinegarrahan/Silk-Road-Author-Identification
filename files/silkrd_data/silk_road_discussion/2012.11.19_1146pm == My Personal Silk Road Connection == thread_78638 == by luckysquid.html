				A moment ago I took a long hard look at myself and truly realised something.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a member of Silk Road for a while now and have enjoyed steadily been completing successful orders. To this day I appear to have been quite lucky and through proper use of the forums and appropriate research have always had fantastic service from the road. <br />I currently find myself checking both the forums and the main site almost every night, Silk Road has very quickly become a part of my Daily Routine. Often I&#039;ll daydream about the pleasurable experimental possibilities and the exciting transactions i&#039;m looking to make next.<br />I&#039;ll catch myself researching for hours about new security measures and updated methods to staying safe on the Road. My understanding of the BitCoin world has grown tremendously thanks to the resources and incredible guides available in this forum. <br />When the road went down recently I genuinely felt quite a strong emotional heartbreak for my beloved community. <br />The &#039;world under the world&#039; had gone offline and I found myself religiously following the thread from DPR anxiously hoping this world would return, the whole time doing everything in my power to block out the droning sound of the trolls.<br /><br />DPR and his team have created something truly powerful here, not only do we have easy access to some of the world&#039;s most sought after substances but we also are part of one of the most engaging, helpful and trustworthy communities available. For this I cannot be more thankful to both the Silk Road team and it&#039;s sellers but also the members that contribute every day. I look forward to each and every day here and I see no reason for that to stop anytime soon.<br /><br />Just wanted to share, if anyone is game I&#039;d also love to hear their connections with Silk Road.

				I tend to spend a lot of my spare time here on SR, browsing the forums and looking at new listings on SR finding new products to invest in. SR is a hobby, lol.

				It&#039;s great to hear others share the same views.<br />I always remember that feeling I had the first time I logged in. Just complete amazement, truly blown away when I saw just what was now available to me.<br />I spent the next few hours trying to find all the risks, luckily they were outweighed by the system in place to make life so much more user friendly. <br />

				I totally agree.&nbsp; I&#039;m on the forum right now just reading for the laughs and knowledge.&nbsp; I stocked up something fierce during the outage so i&#039;m a month away from another purchase, but like you said it is now a part of my daily routine.

				Aww, I feel exactly the same way. I spent a long time just lurking on the forums before I finally took the plunge, and I still read almost every interesting-looking post I see, even if I don&#039;t say much. I may sound like an old hippie lol, but it&#039;s true...I LOVE YOU GUYS!

				100% Agree.<br /><br />I check every morning and night. <br />Morning is usually just browsing and checking messages and stuff like that. <br /><br />But since I deleted my facebook account, which is a concept I loathe (the actual facebook, not the deleting part), I sometimes find myself getting lost in the evenings on researching new drugs, new security and just delving deeper into the hidden parts of the web. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been a member for over a year and It truly has become a part of my daily routine. And I love it. <br />Much more constructive that stalking on facebook.

				+1 for OP, I whole heartedly agree, I just try not to gush so people won&#039;t start thinking of me as a bleeding vag. :(<br /><br />I noticed that since the downtime, I&#039;ve been coming here everyday, even when I&#039;m not waiting on an order or looking for info. I&#039;m not very knowledgable about Tor, security, or even certain things about drug use, so I learn a lot here. :)

				I don&#039;t buy that much or that often, but I find myself visiting the forum and site every day, sometimes just to browse.&nbsp; There is a strong sense of community here which is a nice feeling after years of lurking on 4chan and other such sites.
