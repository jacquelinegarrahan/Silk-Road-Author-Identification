				First off- <br />SR is running like a charm. THANK YOU! so refreshing.<br /><br />I have a question- most of the time when you log in, you have to complete a captcha with a 4 letter / 3 number combo. (The letters/words are usually cleverly related to the content of the site in one way or another, or possibly my mind is just one track.) <br /><br />Sometimes, however, it appears as just 3 numbers. It just did this to me while I was logged in previously. I refreshed until it came up normal.<br /><br />Why does it do this? Is it a bug? Or should I just do the 3 number captcha?<br /><br /><br />Everyone have an epically momentous memorial day. &#039;murica.

It was caused by the recent site hardening and will be eliminated when what&#039;s causing it is found, but it&#039;s not a security vulnerability so it&#039;s not a priority. If you type in the 3 numbers nothing will happen, you&#039;ll just get a &quot;failed login&quot; message.<br /><br />Libertas

				The 3 number captcha has been happening since like a year ago.&nbsp; There was a phase when people and I would constantly get logged off automatically and the 3 number captcha would come out a few times till the working one came out. <br /><br />Actually I&#039;ve been getting logged off recently for first time in a long time this past month.

				Hey since no one else has responded about the other part of your post! , Yes I also noticed that and Also thought is it just me or are these&nbsp; Captchas made by a Stoner or specifically for this site? any other place they are always just random and never spell anything.<br /><br />Id like to hear someone else weigh in on this important topic!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:o
