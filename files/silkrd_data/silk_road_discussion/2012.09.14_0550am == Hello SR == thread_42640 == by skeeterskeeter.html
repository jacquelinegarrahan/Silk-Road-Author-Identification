				I wanted to introduce myself to the community, Hello I am SkeeterSkeeter. <br /><br />I have a few questions, <br /><br />Must I really have 5 transactions before most people with even work with me? <br />What is the percentage of people who have been screwed over by people? <br />After I checkout, I then speak with the seller with PGP encrypted mail to exchange info? <br />

				Hello there! I&#039;m also new to the forums but have been doing some business here for the last 6 months. I would suggest that you start small and domestic if possible. If you deal with people who won&#039;t ask you to finalize early and make a couple of small orders first I think you&#039;ll be just fine. Just search the sellers nickname from these forums and you&#039;ll probably get an idea about the quality of their product and service.<br /><br />About the PGP thing I can&#039;t help you yet, as I&#039;m still in the process of figuring that out myself :) Lazy, I know I should get on top of that but since I order only from domestic sellers and have a clean address for orders I haven&#039;t used it yet. But for my next order I&#039;ll be sure to learn it! <br /><br />These threads seem to have a lot of good information regarding PGP<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938.0<br /><br />Safe shopping!

				Greets, I&#039;m neubi too...<br /><br />But, I have done my homework.&nbsp; For the last 3 weeks I&#039;ve been pouring over the forums.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve learned:<br /><br />Everything comes down to possibilities and probabilities.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it probable you won&#039;t get scammed if you FE, no.&nbsp; But it&#039;s possible.<br />Is it probable your connection is being monitored or your computer has a keylogging trojan that can compromise you?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But it&#039;s possible.<br />Is it probable a new vendor is a fly by night, &quot;I&#039;ll sell to newbies&quot; scammer.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But possibly.<br /><br />Hit up the security forum first and foremost.&nbsp; Make yourself a USB boot system using TAILS or Liberte (I went with the latter to save bookmarks).&nbsp; Do this, THEN create your tormail.org mail account, SR &amp; SR Forums accts, buy bitcoins and have an online bitcoin wallet with a trusted vendor.&nbsp; Don&#039;t login to your gmail or other public accounts with your secure USB system and don&#039;t login via TOR on your personal system to your &#039;secret&#039; accounts.&nbsp; Treat them like cutting boards for meat and vegetables.&nbsp; No cross pollination.&nbsp; SR Transact ONLY using your USB bootable system.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love Apple and Microsoft&#039;s products, but I sure as hell don&#039;t trust them to keep me secure when it comes to my freedom.&nbsp; Yes, TOR is secure on those systems, but you have no idea if you have a keylogging trojan infecting your system.&nbsp; (same goes with virtual machines, they are usually run on a host that could be infected)<br /><br />Read feedback on vendors that are established and search their name in the forums.&nbsp; Take the time and read it all.&nbsp; Yah, it&#039;s very exciting and I want my shit now, but if I had the option on getting a review on everyone I did transactions with in RL, I sure as hell would read it.&nbsp; Take advantage of the info on hand here.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty comprehensive.<br /><br />New vendor offering help?&nbsp; Killer, you&#039;re starting out and so are they so they certainly understand there&#039;s no need for FE.&nbsp; Vendor doesn&#039;t NEED to FE and can use Delivery Notification on their shipment.&nbsp; If it delivered to you and you try to scam, good luck with getting that over on SR admins.&nbsp; If no delivery and you&#039;re in escrow?&nbsp; Sucks, but you&#039;re one less victim.&nbsp; All vendors I have bookmarked to start my rein of purchasing are domestic, have amazing reviews and stay in escrow.&nbsp; Reasons for FE are excuses outside a system that works, leave that shit for dealing with your boss and GF.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure the thing you&#039;re looking to buy is crazy scarce in your hood and you&#039;re gonna make a killing by reselling to your friends.&nbsp; Start small and get some cred with your new vendor.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go buying a shit ton of stuff, I&#039;ve noticed that this seems to freak out vendors if you&#039;ve no buying experience. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get some shit for being so presumptive on only my 2nd post.&nbsp; &nbsp;My apologies in advance for any inaccuracies.<br /><br />*Edit:&nbsp; Oh, don&#039;t be lazy and learn PGP.&nbsp; There&#039;s a ton of posts about it (look for posts by &quot;Pine&quot;) and both TAILS and Liberte&#039; have it built in.&nbsp; Not only is it not difficult to figure out, it&#039;s fucking cloak and dagger coolness. <br /><br />-tMB<br />
