				They already tried this idea with the &quot;Armory.&quot; They have since closed it down.&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt like it brought unwanted heat to the road.&nbsp; I for one would like to see some tazers listed on Silk Road.&nbsp; I am all for non-fatal means of protection.

				Wiggleroom comes across as one weird dude. Maybe he&#039;s misunderstood.<br /><br />Wiggle - are you looking for a revolution of sorts? I&#039;ve read your stuff in other posts that almost outright call for shooting cops and violent rebellion. I can&#039;t figure out if you&#039;re messin&#039; with us (trolling) or if you&#039;re looking to scope out who else feels the same (recruiting). Or if you&#039;re just one of those guys who want to watch the world burn. Maybe you&#039;re just stoned. I dunno. Anything to say about what motivates you?

				NO FUCKING WAY DUDE. if you want sr to exist for as long as we can grow with this site .. we need to keep the fucking MEDIA and POLITICIAN&#039;s HYPE AND HEAT away from our direction. removing the armory was the best thing for SR. imagine the headlines when some stupid snotty 13 year old manages to receive his glock + 100 bullets from SR.. then goes on another one of those popular mass shooting sprees .. <br />my friend, FULL SPOTLIGHT AND DEEP POLITICAL URGENCY AND HEAT would be blasted upon our peaceful little world where we are only &quot;hurting ourserlves&quot; .. (some could argue that)<br /><br />the armory was such a stepping stone to some &quot;terror ot mass shooting spree VIOLENT ACT&quot; from happening. then SR would be POLLUTED with UGLY HYPE and blasted with all these usa politicians trying to appear proactive by petitioning to somehow cripple the TOR network .. or something to that effect. bottom line .. lets keep the violence and murder for hire &quot;services&quot; far away from this site. PLEASE.<br />let the fucking priority to FUCKING ABOMINATE&nbsp; SR just disappear .. let the druggies and &quot;hippies&quot; smoke their weed and take their lil fixes. right now besides 3 or 4 articles there hasn&#039;t been worldwide MEDIA forced attention towards us. which should stay this way.

Though I liked the idea of the armory in principle, it&#039;s not practical. It&#039;s a one-way ticket to getting headfucked fast. We need it gone.

SR exists because so far it has been tolerated. It would take quite a bit of effort to shut it down but if overwhelming political will exists, governments along with LE could make life quite difficult here.

				Seriously, no one in Washington, DC nor anyone in the vast majority of governments truly gives a fuck if a bunch of us want to numb our brains with dope.&nbsp; The reason they won&#039;t legalize drugs has to do with power, money, and fear of public reaction--nothing at all to do with safety.<br /><br />So they pretty much ignore what goes on here . . . doing something about it would be more trouble than it&#039;s worth, BUT if some ass-clown bought a firearm on SR and went on a rampage, the heat here would suddenly become high.&nbsp; <br /><br />The public tends to get very upset over that sort of thing and they would bring maximum pressure to bear on us all.<br /><br />NO FUCKING THANKS.&nbsp; [I understand your dilemma, Wiggle, and I sympathize with you over that idiocy which says - only criminals can have guns - that lies behind all gun laws, but my sympathy only extends to the limit of where my own wishes begin and I wish for SR to continue to be a convenient, safe means of indulging in recreational diversions.&nbsp; :) ] <br /><br />Peace.
