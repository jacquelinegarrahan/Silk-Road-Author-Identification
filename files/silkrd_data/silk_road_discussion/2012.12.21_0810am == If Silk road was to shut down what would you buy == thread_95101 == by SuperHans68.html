				A gun. Because I would kill myself!!!!<br /><br />Ha. No honestly I&#039;d be tempted to buy a shitton of MDMA. I could easily make a 200% profit around here without even cutting it like some kind of asshole. Worst case scenario it gets intercepted and they do a CD because it&#039;s 50 grams, but I&#039;ll just be like, &quot;Haven&#039;t you guys heard? Silk Road doesn&#039;t even exist anymore,&quot; and they wouldn&#039;t be able to do shit!<br /><br />(This is why I&#039;m not a vendor/dealer.)

				Probably a key of methylone and as much 4-ACO-DMT as I could afford after that. I could make tons of profit off those and they&#039;re both chems I think I would enjoy very much in my spare time :]

				Lots of molly and lucy.&nbsp; And if what I hear is true (that mimosa hostilis is now harder to get due to changing laws), then a good bit of dmt, even though the prices are ridic on here when compared to extraction costs.&nbsp; If not, then some more molly...love that stuff.
