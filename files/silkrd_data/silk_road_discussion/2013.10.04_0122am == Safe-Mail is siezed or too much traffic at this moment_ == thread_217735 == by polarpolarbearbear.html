				You getting error messages or what?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been waiting on mail but nothing came through all morning although i&#039;ve been able to flick between different folders and also able to send mail?<br /><br />Still found it strange that nothing came through to me.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been trying safe-mail all day. On the very right hand side of the URL load bar (where you type your website in) you will see a padlock with a &quot;!&quot; and if you scroll over it, it says security broken.<br /><br />I&#039;d stay away from any mail servers right now and stick to encrypted PMs

				Yeah, I logged off and tried opening it on a new tab and it just says taking too long to respond.<br /><br />That&#039;s another thing gone. Thankfully I have never sent a non encrypted message from it so all&#039;s good.<br /><br />Was weary enough of it from the beginning just going by the time frame it was using as standard.<br /><br />The default time on it was East American (now would be 21:52)<br /><br />They&#039;ll take them all eventually the cunts unless anyone knows what is the best alternative option?<br /><br /><br /><br />Evoc.

				It matters less what provide you use then what you say. Use encryption, don&#039;t e-mail sensitive info in clear, use tor to create and login ALWAYS, and be aware of who you e-mail from which account (for meta relationship connections).<br /><br />You don know what happens behind scenes of any provider.

				encrypt your messages using pgp, then put the encrypted pgp message into privnote for added security.
