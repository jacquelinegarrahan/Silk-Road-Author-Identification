				Chiming in with verification of this anomaly, has happened a few times today. Initially was reluctant to sign back in for fear of phishing. Something to keep an eye out for, maybe.

				This was happening to me yesterday but all good today, the re starting tor browser did work once but then not. As I said so far today all good so it will stop.<br /><br />While moderators may be looking here my count down to auto finalize date for orders didn&#039;t stop during the last few days of downtime. I have sent a message to support but want to make sure this problem gets sorted as i have 2 orders in resolution and time fast running out. Hope someone can help.

				Yes I&#039;m also experiencing this. I keep getting logged out and getting sent back to the login screen. I think it is timing out. It keeps happening after a period of inactivity. Also happened to me when I tried to send a message. I took forever to type it and by the time I hit send it had logged me out. I logged back in and pasted the message from the clipboard and was able to send.<br /><br />RV
