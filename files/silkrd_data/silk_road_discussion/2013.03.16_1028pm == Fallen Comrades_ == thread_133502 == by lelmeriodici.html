				quite a few vendors have mentioned doing time to explain long periods of absence but it&#039;s never been silkroad that put them there. that shadh guy had his packages watched by customs for a while before he got raided and he was really stupid. he had his sr vendor name as his car reg... the cops came, he pulled his pants down and bent over.

				You think that&#039;s stupid? You should see the thread for Silk Road Merchandise, ie; a stoner that lives in his ma&#039;s basement, and thinks it would be totally awesome to have a SR T-Shirt on to wear proudly, <br /><br />to show he&#039;s not afraid of breaking the rules! <br /><br />(he even wants to make flags, I kid you not)<br /><br />The amazing part of it all? Is that more than 50% of the people who responded to this proposed idea, couldn&#039;t see one chess move past the unintended consequences.<br /><br />I actually thought this would be a thread about forum friends we&#039;ve made who&#039;ve disappeared. <br /><br />My closest one, has been MIA since like March 6th. Not like him. He was feeling like shit, and wanted to send me something, but couldn&#039;t get out. - I told him to go get checked at a Dr. <br /><br />He had pneumonia.&nbsp; It&#039;s AnonymousAddict, and&nbsp; he had a serious H+benzo jones following him around. - I sympathized with him because I was seeing myself 20 some odd years ago. <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping he went back to the hospital, and they admitted him and he&#039;s getting better. <br /><br />Without giving too much info out, let&#039;s just say if he didn&#039;t make it through that night, consider him a member of the 27 club. <br /><br />I want my friend back more than any drug offered on this site.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />It&#039;s something you can&#039;t put a price on. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Jagfug

				There have been several people lost for various reasons over the past couple years. Some to LE, some to addiction, some to health problems, and others retired. Not all of them were involved in SR, but every one of them holds a small part of my soul. I never got to know some of them half as well as I would have liked, and the ones who I did know well, their loss weighs on my heart regularly. There are several additional friends that I worry about the day when they no longer log in. I understand this is another thread about SR related busts (as they are always popping up), but it is important to remember those who we have lost, whatever the reason. There is one vendor lost who sticks in my mind nearly every day, and another that I would spend one of three wishes to speak to again if such a thing were possible.
