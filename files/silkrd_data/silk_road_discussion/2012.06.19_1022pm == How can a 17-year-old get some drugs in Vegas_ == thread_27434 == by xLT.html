				I scored off the black dude selling the CDs also. Like the man said - just tell him you don&#039;t want that shit music with the banal lyrics bragging about big cars, dicks and who got the biggest line of coke.<br /><br />Thing is - just tell him the codeword - you got to pick up a CD, wink at the guy (might be his brother on when you go, or uncle) and shout out VERY loudly &#039;White Power!!&#039;. <br /><br />Then you unzip you fly and say the next codeword &quot;Well you can all suck some white dick today guys&quot;<br /><br />I would say that will get you sorted out. Got to say, cannot even remember having the good shit last time I scored. It was so good, woke up in a hospital, had a truncheon up my ass. <br /><br />But fair play - coke does weird shit to me that way. Mrs Red sometimes makes me sleep on the sofa.<br /><br />what was the question again?<br /><br />Oh yes, scoring!<br /><br />Other thing is, on Tuesdays, they have a &#039;crazy white ass MF day&#039;. Not sure what this is but I do hear that some guy got a free ounce of top grade English heroin, needles full of the shit. All he done was wear a KKK robe. Cost about dollar, oz of English freebase LSD heroin costs maybe 200 dollars in my estimation. I see 12 yr olds score all the time in some state. Depends on the law. <br /><br />I&#039;d draw the line at selling heroin to 12 yr olds. Coke for 8 yr olds is more or less the way of life in my street. Hooked before your almost off the tit. <br /><br />Now THAT is some crazy shit going on.<br /><br />Like I was telling Mrs Red, its probable we are being kidnapped by extra terrestrial beings from maybe the center of the Earth itself! She went to bed hours ago. <br /><br />Took some LSD with my 3 yr old niece.<br /><br />I usually just sell heroin cut with pure 100% cocaine, off the real blocks! I mean the red ones! White coke, that is fake shit. Most people here praise coke vendors when they are using basic table salt. <br /><br />I&#039;d sell you some of it but got caught by a journalist last year and some news story about babies on heroin. <br /><br />So now I just manufacture a few ton of this shit. Made millions from it. Lost it all backing a bad horse. Fucker died on me. So anyone got any free shit out there?<br /><br />My head is all over the place!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />(smoke less?&nbsp; ;D sure.&nbsp; ;) )<br /><br />ADDED!!!<br /><br />LSD still kicking in - I took like an entire sheet of the shit as it looked like a single blotter and the niece had eaten most anyhows.<br /><br />So then I saw this was POST 333<br /><br />Think about it.<br /><br />You add 333 to that and we all know what that means!<br /><br />6 to the double six - devil shit! 666. <br /><br />This must be the spookiest post you ever read!!! Sorry to bad vibe you. But the niece is talking to me by ESP, normal on weed really. I just hope this post 333 entertained you.<br /><br />I can remember being at only 68. A 68er? That&#039;s when you tell him you owe him a blowjob.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Laters&nbsp; ;)
