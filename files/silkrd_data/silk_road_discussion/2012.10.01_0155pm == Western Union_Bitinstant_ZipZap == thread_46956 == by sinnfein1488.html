				Hello, I am new to SR, just wanted to ask a few simple questions, maybe someone will be able to assist me. I am currently located in a &quot;US territory&quot;, outside of the continental US. I receive all of my mail via USPS, just as I would in the states. The only money transfer service I have access to is Western Union. I noticed many tutorials on purchasing Bitcoin via Bitinstant/ZipZap using moneygram. I noticed some people mentioning that they did it through WU, however I haven&#039;t been able to find much info on the topic. I used the search function, it didn&#039;t seem to be working properly. If someone who has used WU for this service before would be kind enough to explain, it would be greatly appreciated. Secondly, could someone instruct me on the use of the &quot;pgp&quot; coding? I assume this is an encrypted messaging service of some sort? Again, thank you.

				moneygram is easiest as there are several locations to choose from not sure if bitinstant does wu but they also do bank deposit <br /><br />just search pgp there has to be at least 100 threads explaining and showing how to use it

				Ok, will do on the PGP. I read over a few posts where some guys were mentioning that they preferred WU to do their bitinstant, so I&#039;m sure it&#039;s doable. I just want to make sure I&#039;m all set to go before I stroll on in. I have no access to moneygram where I&#039;m at now, only WU. Sure miss walmart now.

				honestly the bank deposit method is easier than wu and faster you can even use the drive through and they have several banks to choose from so should be no problem outside of continental us also wu charges a fee&nbsp; the bank or moneygram = no fee but you choose and have fun ordering some pretty cool shit

				Does anyone actually have experience using western union to complete a zipzap transaction? I went today and tried, but the clerks don&#039;t speak great english, so it was hard to make sure I was pointing them in the right direction. I&#039;ve read on many forums that people use WU to conduct zipzap transactions, but I&#039;m unsure if it&#039;s prepaid service,payments, etc. Any help would be great, as there is no moneygram where I am now. Thank you.

				hi sinnfein1488<br /><br />im new to the road as well.&nbsp; i used bitinstant for the first time last week with no problems at all.&nbsp; i paid cash through moneygram at a drug store.&nbsp; depending on the store, they will have you arrange the payment through moneygram using an in store phone.&nbsp; once thats done you simply go the clerk at the register and tell them you have a pending &quot;Express Payment&quot;.&nbsp; they will be able to pull up your order (assuming they speak the English) and you pay them cash.&nbsp; they money was in my wallet within an hour so i consider that pretty fast.&nbsp; hope that helps.
