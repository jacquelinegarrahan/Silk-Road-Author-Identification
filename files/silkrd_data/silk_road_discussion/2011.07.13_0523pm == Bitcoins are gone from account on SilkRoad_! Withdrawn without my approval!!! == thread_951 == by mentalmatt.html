				Hey everyone,<br /><br />So I&#039;ve been using SilkRoad for a couple weeks now and everything has been smoooth sailing... That is of course, until I just logged into my account and noticed the 12.88 bitcoins I had left are now gone.&nbsp; I have a transaction in escrow right now as I&#039;m waiting on the product to arrive before I finalize as it&#039;s my first with this seller.&nbsp; That said, I don&#039;t believe they&#039;re related, just thought I would mention all the details.&nbsp; So I had like 15 bitcoins tied up in escrow and then I had another 12.88 bitcoins just waiting to be used on my next purchase.<br /><br />So when I logged in this morning, I noticed that it shows I now have 0 bitcoins.&nbsp; This is a little alarming, since I did not place another order (even if I had, it&#039;d be in escrow, not automagically withdrawn from my account), I can only assume either someone brute-forced my password and stole my bitcoins, or there is a larger problem with SilkRoad and I&#039;m just one of many affected.&nbsp; No one I know has access to my account or even knows what I&#039;m doing, so there is no way it could be someone I know.<br /><br />The scary part is in my account it just shows as withdrawn to some bitcoin address that I have no idea who it is.&nbsp; I contacted SilkRoad, but I&#039;m not sure.&nbsp; Has this ever happened to anyone else?&nbsp; What should I do?&nbsp; Please help me.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it shows in my account:<br /><br />withdrawal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1EAz3M77ZC4SbG8ACLa62whWAm8FKu3d6W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿-12.88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿0.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 13, 2011, 8:55 am UTC

				If you have that many bitcoins on the account you should have a strong password as well, this is your own responsibility and no one else&#039;s.

				Two main possibilities. <br />Probably you signed into a phishing site. Hidden Wiki and other places sometimes change the Silk Road link.<br />Then the phishers log your name and pass and then send you to a failed CAPTCHA page on Silk Road and then you log in normally on your second try.&nbsp; You should always either type in the address or use your own bookmark. You you should always check your address bar for ian and the z6z.<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion<br /><br />my mnemonic:&nbsp; (In three parts)<br />ian crossed 6 palindrome F*ed up elk.&nbsp; <br />72 (is) un-lucky <br />almost at the end, don&#039;t forget the 4 Zs -2 of them so palindrome makes sense, 2 more at&nbsp; Z end.<br /><br />The other big issue is shared passwords (like MtGox) between sites. Use unique passwords each time. I recommend KeePass versions available for all OS

				Sounds like phishing to me, too.&nbsp; After creating your account, have you ever accessed SR using the link on hidden wiki?<br /><br />Displaying a warning about hidden wiki redirect/phishing should be given to all users after they first sign up.&nbsp; It&#039;s a significant security issue.

				I always use my bookmark and have almost memorized the real address. Also, I always xfer all bitcoins out to my wallet. Also, are you using the same username and password for other sites? I have different passwords for every account using non dictionary words with numbers.<br /><br />In fact, the only two accounts that even share the same username is the forum and the market but the passwords are different.

				Did you have a mt gox account?&nbsp; I have seen this same type of story several times and the mt gox hack has been behind most of them.&nbsp; &nbsp; CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS
