				Well, I am new to Silk Road and BitCoins. So as always I like to research things in dept before I execute any plan. I&#039;ve been glancing at the prices for almost all items. At first, I was really excited to see the rates so low because i was unware of the exchange rate between BTC (BitCoins) to USD (US Dollars). Then I realized that, currently 1 BTC = about $5.5 USD (average). Compared to market prices in the US, all the prices are PRETTY EXPENSIVE. Does anyone have a opinion or comment about this matter? Why are things expensive when they should be coming from someone near the source (chemists) , since everyone on the site claims to have relatively &quot;PURE&quot; products. When you take into consideration of the risk involved of receiving mailed product compared to buying stuff off a trusted friend in person, is it really worth it with prices being so HIGH when the only incentive is &quot;PURITY&quot;??? You might not agree with the expensiveness if you don&#039;t have good drug connects &quot;in real life&quot; lol. I would appreciate if people who know good connections and know their drugs to comment on this. (I am not intrested in talking about weed, chemicals only)<br /><br />Also, an unrelated question. Why do Silk Road sellers not sell the raw chemical ingredients to make some of the drugs, in particular the raw chemical ingredients to makeLSD, MDMA and DMT. Is anyone aware of other underground onion websites for more serious buyers?

				lol, for more serious buyers. most people wouldnt know the first thing about taking a precursor and doing anything productive, let alone pure enough, with it. the road is the only route of travel if you are looking to get very far on the journey you seek. The precursors are in most cases just as if not more difficult to obtain as the drugs themselves, more difficult to transport, often dangerous and toxic, and probably dont bring as much money. Customers want product. Say one wanted to extract dmt or mescaline, if one was crafty and knowledgeable one could obtain everything one needs without silk road or tor... <br /><br />Ever heard of supply and demand? Theres a ton of these threads about people complaining about the prices so do a search if you want an explanation why the prices are higher than you would expect. <br /><br />Good luck on the road, its a rough path to travel if you dont walk with your head first.

				Im not complaining, I was just baffled by the prices because most of what i buy would be for resale, and im looking for an angle to market the products, so far the only thing i can think of is the purity. There is very high competition here. People are making things them selves. Ive only personally only extracted nnDMT, which is easy, not because i lack knowledge of how to make more complex stuff, but cuz when buying raw ingredients and precursors, it raises many red flags with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Tor offers security, thats one big advantage of the Road. Also, i am not ordering anything to my house so im pretty safe as far as getting caught goes, thats why i really wanted to see ingredients and precursors of drugs on this site. I assumed the since the products were coming from Europe and Asia that things would be cheaper due to liberal drug policies compared to the US. This site is perfect for the common user, but it lacks competitiveness as far as precises are concerned for resale. I think the people who told about this site hyped it up too much for me, i was expecting a &quot;Gold Road&quot;, well in fact its just a gravel back road. Still love the site and im gonna be using it, but the sellers should offer better deals for people who are interested in resale. Come on guys/girls lets FLOOD the markets lol.

				Move to Australia. Every single item on the road is cheaper and better quality than what I can source locally. Where I live, people pay $40 for pills with no MDMA in them and $90 for a 1/4 of crap bush weed.

				u gota be kidding me man.. <br /><br />90%+ pure mdma for 50-70 a gram.. try finding that in real life and not getting shorted/shanked in the mean time..<br /><br />the site isnt for resale, its for personal use, if you want a site that provides wholesale prices, ul WILL get the attention from LEO due to massive amounts of drugs being bought/sold. search around and contact people if you want a supplier, dont complain that cant find it on SR<br /><br />get over it and stop complaining, SR is amazing.

				You can easily make money, depending on where you live, and buy in ounces not grams. you can buy an ounce between 300 to 400 dollars and sell half a gram for 15, all the stuff on here is high quality to medical grade and EVERYONE is looking for stuff like that its hard to get that stuff in many places.

				I agree, alot of the prices are pretty ridiculous. The MDMA crystal (not pills) is priced well for the most part but thats about it. The coke prices are crazy but I think that&#039;s because alot of it is coming from Europe. I am surprised no one is selling NYC style stamp bags (heroin), they can be acquired for $4-8 on the street, they can be upwards of 70% purity and easy to ship. The price of opiod pharms is really unbelievable.. who the fuck would pay $600+ for 100 OC 80&#039;s??? I&#039;m not knockin the hustle but damn, some of these prices could be cut in half and still make the vendor good money.

				1. risk involved for vendors.<br />2. value of BTC always dropping.&nbsp; <br />3. supply and demand. <br />4. seller fees. (SR bumps up the prices of items. He gets his cut too)<br /><br />these 4 factors make my items more expensive, but if you don&#039;t like it you can always use another vendor. :)

				- coke isn&#039;t coming from its going to europe....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - quality coke is being cleaned to remove impurities and obviously isn&#039;t the only factor hiking up the price....can&#039;t speak for every vendor but price variation is<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; around 20% (guesstimate..)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - generally can&#039;t justify the ever increased cost of coke,&nbsp; whilst the overall poor quality on a downward trend, i don&#039;t mind paying more for a quality product in<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6mths time but don&#039;t expect a worse off product {again this is how it is out there...}<br /><br />- mdma is being produced locally and aside from buyers purposefully buying us &lt;--&gt; eu it seems to be almost always available locally -hence competitive good prices;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;there are no dependencies on s/america here like coke...<br /><br />- agree some items are on the pricey side..<br /><br />- i&#039;ve given up buying from the streets, dealers attitude and disinterest in quality by cutting the original product, decent product here far outweigh the risks.<br /><br />

				I suspect prices will start falling as the number of vendors continues to increase in each product area. Although demand is also increasing, changes in the number of vendors should have a larger impact on prices.

				Cheapest L I ever got in the 90&#039;s was $5 a hit, so you were getting a deal, brother.<br />My Mom used to pay the same in the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s...<br />Since about &#039;96 or &#039;97 I saw the price creep upwards quite a bit, due to scarcity and &quot;shipping&quot; costs.<br />That&#039;s the other cost of Silk Road, shipping.<br /><br />Some vendors require you to select shipping, and some INCLUDE shipping costs.<br />Vaccuum sealers and bags, and other packing materials cost money too.<br />Some of these guys WILL sell you larger quantities at cheaper prices, but you usually have to buy a few smaller orders to prove you aren&#039;t an asshole.&nbsp; Nobody is just going to sell you gigantic quantities of goods sight-unseen.&nbsp; Hell, you could be a scammer or LEO.
