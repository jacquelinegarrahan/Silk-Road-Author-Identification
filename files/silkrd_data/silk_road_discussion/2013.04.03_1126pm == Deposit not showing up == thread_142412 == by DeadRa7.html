				Greetings to all who read this.&nbsp; Very early this morning I withdrew coin from my blockchain wallet and sent them to SR (0.52419354 BTC, to be exact) and I&#039;ve waited all day and it hasn&#039;t shown up.&nbsp; It is showing as &quot;Unconfirmed transaction!&quot; where it would normally state how many confirmations the transaction has been through.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a deposit take this long, so before I open up a support ticket I was wondering if anybody is experiencing the same thing, or if they have any advice on anything that I can do besides just be patient. <br /><br />+1 to everyone who posts in this thread, thank you :)

				Yeah its happening with the withdrawls rite now, im still waiting after 72hours closing in, DPR is expecting another several days. I take this may also be in effect for deposits. Might not be what you wanted to hear but it is what it is at this point.

				My guess is that it has to do with all of the issue with Mt Gox and instawallet and DDoS shit today.&nbsp; I have several transactions with 0 confirmations as well that are unrelated to SR.&nbsp; They were sent with a fee, but the fee was stripped.

				How long does it usually take for the deposit to show up ?<br />I used the shared option to send the btc (that uses several adresses before the final one). <br />It is showing as confirmed in blockchain but nothing yet in my SR account.<br /><br />Edit :<br /><br />Waiting was around an hour, so all of you making your first deposit do not panic and let time do it&#039;s work. I&#039;m guessing it could take even more time than that.<br />

				As long as you can see it on blockchain.info then it should get moving unless something happened when you transferred it.<br /><br />Did you transfer it from an offline wallet like bitcoin-qt?<br /><br />I just did a couple of transactions earlier, they took about an hour and 7 confirmations each before it showed up.<br />
