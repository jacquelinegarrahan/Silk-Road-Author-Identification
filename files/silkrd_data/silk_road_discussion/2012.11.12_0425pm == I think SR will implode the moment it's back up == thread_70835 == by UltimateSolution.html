				Most vendors will only have a few orders and message to tend to since the site has been down nobody has been able to message or place orders...<br /><br />With that said, the amount of orders and messages that will be processed when the site is back will be ridiculous!<br /><br />Dank

				don&#039;t you think this is what they&#039;re working on?<br />DPR already said something about us increasing in volume/expanding way larger/quicker<br />than we could have ever foreseen.<br />so stfu and stop raging everyone.<br /><br />the site will be up before you know it.. and your needles will be back in your arms.<br />in the mean time.. go eat a methadone, subutex, or a suboxone.<br />OR... play guitar? video games? go outside and walk? go spend time with your families?<br />i mean... the possibilities are endless.. and after you&#039;ve been away from your sweaty ass-soaked computer chair..<br />you&#039;ll notice it was easier than you could have ever imagined.<br /><br />cheers.<br />/thumbs

				I think the recent growth is being overplayed a bit. DPR just walked away from the controls for a day and the site crashed. <br />However, if it is the case, I think this 3 day blackout will cause a significant decrease in activity.<br /><br />For those who need their drugs: SR isn&#039;t the only site! look around, do some research, and get your favorite vendors e-mail addys when SR comes back up.

				I&#039;m surpised vendors arent putting up their contact info so their trusted customers can contact them and work things out on the side.&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting till there is an official all clear posted here, and then waiting a few days more at least to log in to the main site to try to avoid being part of the problem when it comes online.&nbsp; There will be a huge rush of traffic and that will make things even worse.&nbsp; Ideally they will tell the vendors in the vendors area first so only a portion of users sign in at first.
