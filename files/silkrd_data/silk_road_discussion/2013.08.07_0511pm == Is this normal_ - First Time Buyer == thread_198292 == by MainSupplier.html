				So after being a lurker on SR for awhile i took initiative and placed my first order a month and a half ago, Now keep in mind i&#039;m aware of the risks and know that packages may be intercepted from time to time if the buyer isn&#039;t using proper stealth which is why i ordered from 3 different Top Sellers because i knew that the odds of all 3 orders being lost/intercepted were slim i mean atleast one of those sellers had to use proper stealth. <br /><br />After waiting eagerly an month and a half for a few sample orders which varied from seeds to bud, I still haven&#039;t received an single thing. <br />I immediately contacted the sellers and asked what is going on and to my freaking luck one of them claimed he mislabeled the order, another claimed that the order was never sent out and the last said he would reship because apparently he got the wrong address.<br /><br />Now i may be a noob within this community but if there is one thing i did prior to ordering was doing my homework, finding out which vendors where the best, reviewing feedback, product quality and stealth. I find it hard to believe that 3 freaking orders don&#039;t get shipped out in an timely manner, i mean not to be rude here but is this normal? I don&#039;t even know what to say, 1.5 months of waiting for nothing.. :( <br /><br />Is this an ongoing thing within vendors? because my first time has been ruined by this experience.

				In my experience with some of the weed sellers they ship a little slower then others, but sounds like you just had some crappy luck.<br /><br />I would not have waited so long for any of them to arrive either tho, I read the vendor policy and then usually they say if you dont have your order in x days to let them know..<br />Lots of buyers have double and triple digits number of successful transactions, I would just chalk it up to experience and order from someone else..

				It depends of your country and where the seller ships from, It tooks a long time when the items are shipped overseas.<br /><br />but you have a little bad luck.

Anyways i&#039;m talking with some of them now hopefully we can work something out, Thank you guys for the support i will not give up on SR that easy.

				That right there is why you should never use privinote I&#039;m afraid<br />Along with the fact even if you could go to resolution center it&#039;s your word against the vendor since all communication is lost <br />

				I&#039;m pretty sure this is selective scamming. I&#039;ve seen a lot of vendors with littered scam reports under GREAT reputation.<br /><br />I&#039;ve recieved all my domestic orders, and all my international orders - your case is rare.

				It&#039;s not normal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a package go missing and I&#039;ve made between 25-100 orders on SR in the past 2 years or less.&nbsp; To residences, PO Boxes and drops.&nbsp; Never had anything not show up. <br /><br />Learn to PGP, learn to SR.

Nor what anyone else says. I get that you have an opinion and even if I think it is wrong, you think it is right. BUT when I post in here, I only post from my point of view. I am not going to say in every single post I make that it is not personal BUT...so I know that many post I write come off arrogant or as if I can&#039;t be wrong.LOL.&nbsp; First I find it really funny that a few&nbsp; people get pissed about that... so I actually play it up. Why wouldn&#039;t I??? I love that people get pissed at shit talking. Nothing better to me then when someone say&#039;s &quot;do you have to be so arrogant?&quot;<br /><br />But for you to say &quot;everyone gives me shit&quot; is just totally inaccurate. And actually the FACTS are totally with me. Not against me. Since you seem to care, go read the thread again. See what I say and then see what is said after me. If you did that, you would clearly see that very few disagree.. Also I have over 600 customers and I have been here for 1.5 years and I have never had anything but 5/5....so CLEARLY I am winning. I was told by these idiots when I became a vendor that if I did not use pgp I would not get customers. <br /><br /><br />Now I can&#039;t believe that I am addressing this...but I have to. You actually said that because you can only visit privnote 1 time that it means someone that uses it is more likely to keep information????? You ...actually believing this ...is really insane. Your analogy with Scarlett Johannson&#039;s breast is totally lost on me. As I think she is a midget and I think she is fat. Also I think her tits suck. BUT I understand what you were trying to say (just use Jessica Alba)...and I totally disagree with the analogy and think you even thinking that is off the charts crazy. I do not need to save anything or look at address 2 times. I look at it, I address the label and that&#039;s it. I do not even understand how you think someone that uses privnote vs pgp would be more likely to keep an address or not. And I do not even think that is an issue.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now you say this---<br /><br />&quot;If you are fine with your messages going through a third party considering what just happened Tormail and&nbsp; FH I think you cant be taking security nearly as seriously as you say you are&quot;<br /><br />What messaging are you talking about??? This whole sentence is incorrect. I do not use privnote at all ...first off. Nor did I use tormail. I tell buyers they can use it for their address if they must but that they are totally fine just sending it through SR. And I stand by that. But the biggest issue I have with what you typed is not only how out of context you take what I say, but how you say MY security is somehow compromised!! <br /><br />My security is NEVER at issue. EVER. PGP or no PGP, RxKing&#039;s security is never the issue. This is only about the buyer not wanting their address on SR or not. Every buyer that uses PGP is going to have there address out there. And that is my problem with pgp and all the security talk, it is just that...talk. PGP offers NO SECURITY AT ALL!!<br /><br />But since you seem to know so much.......will you please tell me how PGP will protect me? I would love to hear it. But since the answer is....it can&#039;t.....go ahead and tell me how pgp will protect the buyer. I would love to hear that. And don&#039;t use &quot; If SR gets compromised&quot; .....I want to hear the reason pgp is so great. I will be waiting for your answer.<br /><br />Also my BIG ISSUE is all the paranoia for NO REASON. Every time the littlest thing happens, they come out of the wood works about how SR is compromised...and of course they are wrong every time! And then there are idiots that say if you are not a little paranoid then you are not secure...that is just crazy thinking. I do not buy gold either. I do not store water or food. I have guns. If the world ends, I will take what I need from some loser that prepped. Or even better I hope I die. I do not want to survive on canned food and bottle water. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve noticed a few vendors that have no issue screwing with new people because they think they can hide behind reputation. Others are just lazy and expect you to wait until they can bother to ship your order, whenever that may be. I was able to narrow down who I use to a few people that ship fast and everything gets through. I pay them fast as well and there are no issues. One good rule is if a vendor has 15 pages of &quot;rules&quot;, &quot;stipulations&quot;, or &quot;random fine print&quot; on their page you should avoid them. They put that there so they can justify whatever complaints you make against them as &quot;you didn&#039;t read their rules&quot;. This applies to the US only for me, no idea where you live. I&#039;ve made a decent amount of orders and only one didn&#039;t arrive timely. And it was one of the above vendors with more rules than the bible.

				I hear ya. I was tempted by a UK vendor with good prices but all kinds of rules, anti-n00b, pro-FE, etc. in the end I&#039;ve avoided them and have had nothing but amazing success stories so far on the road.<br /><br />Go with your gut - not your wallet.

				Unless it is a weekend or Holiday, No vendor EVER should take more then 1 day to ship an item. Meaning they should ALWAYS ship the item the next business day at the latest. <br /><br />The exception to this is the vendors that say on their page ... they only ship on certain days. <br /><br />The worst thing about Silk road is WAITING! And the worst wait is when you place an order and you are just waiting to see &quot; In transit&quot;. And that is also one of the best moments....when you see that switch on your order page to in transit.<br /><br />The vendors that mark a package in transit...but in fact have not even packaged it yet and it is not an honest mistake, should have their vending privileges suspended for 14 days minimum. And fined the price of the order. That would stop this bullshit. Other then scammers, there is nothing worse to me then reading about a vendor that marks the package in transit..but has not done shit..Then to make it even worse...they do not return messages to explain(lie) about that bullshit.

				&quot;PGP IS A MUST&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently not because i think i encrypted 5 orders when I first joined.<br /><br />&nbsp;RXKing,&nbsp; there is a mailman who started a thread.&nbsp; you will like it, check it out, obviously all the weird paranoid crap will continue but he straight up says &quot;No ive never seen any drug busts or anything like that, nobody gives a shit&quot;&nbsp; except people who have to use privnote to send a message.&nbsp; lolol, if you are ordering a $3,000.00 order overseas I could at least understand being nervous.&nbsp; But who does everyone think is hacked into their computer investigating their $150.00 xanax purchase.&nbsp; hahahahahaha&nbsp; the only people i could think of are the DEA which obviously they arent, or ur local police, which they most likely really dont feel like staying past their shift to stake you out.&nbsp; Its not about being lazy,&nbsp; why not take it a step further and for every order you place drive 100 miles to the public library and have it shipped to an open field in the next state, then wait to pick it up only after minimum of 2 months.&nbsp; its just overkill, and nonsense and so is half the crap people talk about doing.&nbsp; Open a mailbox at UPS store with a fake i.d. and then have a friend pick it up with a stolen key duplicate.&nbsp; if you are that nervous sell on ebay, (but still of course only privnote addresses)
