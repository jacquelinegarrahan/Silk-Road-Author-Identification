				Let&#039;s put on our conspiracy thinking caps for a moment...<br /><br />All of the following is technically possible:<br /><br />(ordered from most to least likely in my estimation)<br /><br />- Their intention was to let SR continue running in the hopes of being able to bust some of the major US vendors (forensically looking for security mistakes by vendors)<br /><br />- Realizing the consequences of the SR bust, the goons have set up SR alternatives in advance<br /><br />- They have also taken over older SR alternatives such as BMR<br /><br />- The FBI also have access to and complete control over this server (the SR forums), looking for vendor mistakes (unencrypted PII while high/drunk, correlations/patterns that can lead to PII, etc)<br /><br />- There are agents posting on this forum for certain purposes, such as damage control (mitigating ideas/speculations/theories that are on the right track)<br /><br />- I myself could be an agent writing the above to spread paranoia and uncertainty<br /><br />But it&#039;s also possible that none of these are true. But US vendors (and US buyers) should tread extra carefully.<br /><br />BMR has been around for longer and is therefore more likely to be safe. &quot;Sheep market&quot; sounds like a name FBI techs would not use, but that image might be precisely the intention if that were to be the case.<br /><br />As for buyers, I&#039;d say buy only from vendors that can prove (with PGP) that they are the same ones from SR.<br /><br />

				We&#039;re led to believe that DPR was an incompetent fool after all, but that he did separate the SR main site from the forums. What if the forums were on the same server and the goons simply left the forums open to collect more intel? They would probably want insight into various things, such as:<br /><br />- Where the big vendors are going next<br /><br />- How the general mood of the SR community is affected (they&#039;re probably hoping for defeatism)<br /><br />- Difference in traffic to the forum indicating how many former forum users are scared shitless<br /><br />- What image is being shaped of DPR after the murder for hire allegations became known<br /><br />- How much support DPR might receive - could it be a threat?<br /><br />

If they&#039;ve got server images from SR, and the forums are indexed by onion.to, they don&#039;t need to leave them up to gather intel. They&#039;ve got an assload already. They unsealed the civil forfeiture warrant, so you can read for yourself what they asked the court for permission to seize.
