This is the &#039;Silk Road Discussion&#039; forum, not the Rumor Mill. Therefore this post is in the wrong section.<br /><br />You can&#039;t just post a topic meant for the Rumor Mill in an inappropriate section because there are others discussing different, more interesting topics in the appropriate forum.&nbsp; Why, if we all did that it would be madness! Chaos! Destruction everywhere and not a single man, woman, &#039;man-woman&#039; or child left alive!<br />The Silk Road Discussion forum would EXPLODE, such would be the number of topics it holds, showering us all in &#039;inappropriate topic&#039; blood, guts, tears and doo-doo. Tremors would be felt all over the Darknet and it would usher in a new age of philosophical musings as people wonder if a meteor has finally struck the Darknet, and ponder the effectiveness of hiding under a table or standing in a doorframe just in case the ground disappears beneath their feet and swallows them up into a nothingness of inappropriately placed topics.<br /><br />Wasn&#039;t it DPR who decried Inappropriate Topics as the worst cardinal sin, with the community standing before him/her nodding their heads in agreement? You&#039;re damn right it was! Santa puts people on his &#039;naughty list&#039; for it every year, and the Easter Bunny, OH, the Easter Bunny.. You don&#039;t even wanna KNOW what that man-woman-rabbit does to people for it. You like receiving chocolate eggs on Easter right? Not these kinds.<br /><br />Help stave off the apocalypse, northwest. Join the fight against the madness! Be the man, woman or man-woman you were meant to be! Or just stop fucking bumping your fucking review thread in the wrong fucking section, it&#039;s getting on my fucking nuts and prompted the above fucking ridiculous reply! Stop it! Just fucking stop it! Stop before the mouse button or type-pad you&#039;re using vaporises from it&#039;s crazed overuse. Help us to help you, northwest. Take my advice. Stop being a fucking douche.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
