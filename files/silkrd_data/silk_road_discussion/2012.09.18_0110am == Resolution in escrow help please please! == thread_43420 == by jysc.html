				Hydrofarm is running with a lot of ppl&#039;s money using early FE, fortunately I stayed in escrow.<br />I put my transaction to Resolution Center asking for 100% refund.<br />From here on, I am unsure of what to do, I just realized resolution doesn&#039;t do anything unless the seller agrees to refund the $.<br /><br />Thanks much in advance guys<br /><br />EDIT: Without any words to me, Hydrofarm has responded to the Resolution at the last minute only offering 50% refund and providing a fake DCN. DCN says it arrived to New York, I don&#039;t even live in New York lol.

				The seller has 4 days to reply. If they dont then SR Support gets involved and if the vendor has disappeared it will default back to you.<br /><br />If the vendor responds s/he can make a counter offer. If you and the vendor can not work it out and s/he has proof of shipment then SR will rule in the vendors favor. <br />

Can other people confirm that at this point Hydrofarm has decided to jump ship and steal a bunch of money? I was starting to assume as much, he&#039;s been incredibly unresponsive, his ratings have dropped from 88% to 78% in the three weeks I&#039;ve been waiting for my order to arrive, and he changed his profile into stealth mode to hide as much as he can. I had a large order with him, and fortunately made sure to stay in escrow as well.<br /><br />DPR/SR Support, can you please let us know more about the Hydrofarm situation? Have you tried contacting him to see what is up with the recent orders? Will people who are in resolution have to wait any longer than the 5 days, or can we assume at this point Hydrofarm has left the building and we can have our money returned ASAP?

				Well the best You can do in this situation is to wait for the due date of resolution. If the vendor is an evident scammer then You&#039;ll get 100% refund. ASAP at this point is the due date of the resolution. Pming forum mods/customer support on SR main page will do You no good. Just wait and You&#039;ll get the refund :P<br /><br />~~sitamaja

I was bringing it up so (Moderators/DPR/SR Support) could help to verify Hydrofarm&#039;s current status. Apparently multiple customers are having similar problems, we are just bringing SR Admin&#039;s attention to the issue.

				Wow exactly what I was scared of...<br /><br />Went through Resolve Center and he provided with a fake tracking # at the last minute.<br />I tracked the # and it&#039;s arrived to a complete random place in New York, I don&#039;t even live in that state.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe SR staff still isn&#039;t jumping to this issue I&#039;ve been PMing with SR staff about this for a week now and they just extended the due date by 3 days...<br /><br />What should I do?

				Just ask for Your 100% refund again and write that You don&#039;t live in that state and everything. Also don&#039;t get enraged by his tactics, stay polite&amp;nice so the SR staff can see that You aren&#039;t the bully in this situation.<br /><br />All that said I hope that You get the refund You deserve and I hope these scammers burn in hell. &lt;.&lt;<br /><br /><br />~~sitamaja
