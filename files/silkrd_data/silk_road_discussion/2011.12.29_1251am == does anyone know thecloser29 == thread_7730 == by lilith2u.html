				I do not know thecloser29. If you made a transaction outside of escrow then it&#039;s likely that you&#039;ve made your first noob mistake. Trading on the forum is very rarely a good idea, although there have been successful transactions. However they&#039;re very unique as someone will front their product to a well respected member of the community who will pay upon receiving the goods. Even that poses risks as there have been a few very high profile vendors who have simply picked up and left. What I&#039;m trying to say is *always* deal in escrow unless you&#039;ve developed trust with a vendor, and even then be very careful.

				I think its going to be OK and still think hes legit its just adds allot more paranoia to a already sometimes shaky situation, he got back to me and our time difference was what was throwing me off. Like the idea of establishing a good buyer seller relationship, want this to work! have only been good experiences&nbsp; so far except expensive!&nbsp; here is the dilemma, my drug of choice is benzos, so i need them to be chill on orders like these:) I&#039;ll update when i receive and give good rating if it works out, it hasn&#039;t been long at all yet. <br />but lesson learned, Escrow only from here out...long live SR........Thank you Madam!
