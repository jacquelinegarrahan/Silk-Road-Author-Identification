				From what I hear about the last 420 event, it was a success.&nbsp; Prizes, giveaways and vendors showing off their weed with incentives to buy. . . <br /><br />Anyone want to try to organize another one?&nbsp; DPR?&nbsp; Admins?&nbsp; Aliens?&nbsp; Jimmy Hoffa?<br />&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to help with threads, writing and promotion .&nbsp; Graphic design and shit like that .&nbsp; <br /><br />We could host the first meeting here.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Draft Agenda:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Set the date for the event .&nbsp; &nbsp;Week long or two?<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Notifying vendors first.&nbsp; Need messaging volunteers to send out a crafted promo message detailing the event as it pertains to vendors.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Setting up the contests and prizes and giveaways.&nbsp; Need donations as well as advertising spots available as an incentive to get on board with the event.&nbsp; &nbsp;Each MSG and post that goes out about the event will have ad spots for sponsors.&nbsp; This should be enough to raise a few prizes for contests.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Setting up a photo contest safely with anon image boards.&nbsp; Need someone to organize the safety and rules about posting Picts, but it would be neat to see a gallery made up or something .<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Threads and posts need to be managed and someone who can make it a &#039;sticky&#039; for the duration of the event.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Any other agenda items?<br />Thoughts?<br /><br />It could be organized here in this thread.&nbsp; People picking one agenda task and taking charge of it. Report back here with updates.&nbsp; <br /><br />Host another meeting in a few days and see where we are and what is left to complete. <br />I hope people can organize this again, however it was done before. <br /><br />I&#039;m not taking a leadership role here.&nbsp; It&#039;s up to the admins and mods to do this work , but hey. I&#039;m willing to help however I can.<br /><br />Thanks all.<br />

				Ya, the original post had a rant about what is wrong with things, but I didn&#039;t want to sound negative.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I try to be funny sometimes and it comes off wrong. Sorry about stupid posts.<br /><br />Thanks for the +1&nbsp; back at you.<br /><br />Tony76 ?&nbsp; Anyone can pull that off today, nothing has been fixed.&nbsp; Ask EnterTheMatrix, - he&#039;ll tell you all about FE - he just pulled it off last week.&nbsp; That has nothing to do with this and someday they will fix the order page to not allow FE and have a terms as a reminder before ordering.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, just follow the rules and the big bad Tony76 will never get you.&nbsp; If you FE because some rich dealer says he&#039;s broke and needs the cash, and SR even has a loan available to vendors if they need cash, not to mention lenders, credit cards, and a freaking job.&nbsp; Not sure why FE is even done in the first place.&nbsp; Getting cash is easy if you got cash coming in.<br /><br />-----------------|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|--<br /><br />I hope we can get something fun started here and have a few good tokes along the way too.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to try out at least 12 different weeds and oil, hashes I&#039;ve had my eyes on for a while.&nbsp; Just need a shove to place the orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;I like that bubble hash and would like to try the Obsidian hard oil too.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even the cheaper hashes on the road have been good for me.&nbsp; My favorite weed has been the Red Diesel from MrOiud in Canada.&nbsp; It was a different high and really head stoned big time.&nbsp; Confused and retarded afterwards&nbsp; nice!<br /><br />Stuff like M39 isn&#039;t my cup of tea.&nbsp; I found it too commercial and common like and not really any properties to talk about other than really compacted buds.<br /><br />&nbsp;The baked goods on the road look great too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d like to learn how to make the budder oil.&nbsp; There is an alternate way I&#039;ve done that uses a fast drill with a mixing bit to whip some butane honey oil into a fluffy putty that is full of air bubbles and really potent.&nbsp; It expands like candy or something.&nbsp; Neat.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been hoping they&#039;d do another sale for a while now. It would have to be organized by DPR and Co. The vendors would have their special sale prices, but the random prize give away would need to be written into the Roads OS by DPR or whoever (like last time).<br /><br />After last time (Tony76) maybe DPR doesn&#039;t feel it&#039;s worth the hassle, it&#039;s not like he needs to generate more revenue. But I feel people have learned from their mistakes last time, and if they haven&#039;t and still FE, then there really is nothing you can do to help them! If you never spend more on an order than you could afford to lose, and if you never order more drugs than you&#039;d risk to get caught with, then you&#039;ll have no problem traveling this Road. :D&nbsp;
