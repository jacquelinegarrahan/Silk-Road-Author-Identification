				Hello--<br />&nbsp;<br />If it has been past 4 days and you have the option to cancel as the vendor has not shipped it yet,&nbsp; a.k.a marked it &quot;in transit&quot; (un-fucking real that is even possible, if&nbsp; a vendor has not shipped with in 4 days and he has not died, he should get 1/5, you should get 150% refund, and he should be suspended for 3 days IMO) you can indeed cancel it, nothing will change with your buyer stats, and on the vendors order page it will be deleted. <br /><br />I assume you meant will he get a message saying it was canceled or something of that manner. And all that will happen is that when the vendor refreshes his page your order will no longer be there. The is no notification. This is based on what I have heard/read in the vendor only forum as I have never had an item canceled on myself.<br /><br />Also that would not qualify as a refund.. <br /><br />If the vendor cancels it after 4 days you have the option to leave feedback. You won&#039;t have that option if you cancel the order obviously.<br /><br />

Once you&#039;ve placed your order, your vendor has up to 4 days to either ship it or cancel it. After 4 days, if they haven&#039;t shipped it, you can cancel it yourself from your orders page. When you cancel, you will immediately be given a full refund and it won&#039;t affect your stats.&nbsp; :)

				I would want my coins back too!! That is bullshit. The good news is that the price of the btc has gone up in that time..so you will make money.<br /><br />Also there is no mention of this exact thing in the Wiki. Also as I said I am basing my message on what I know to be 100% true based on what was said about this very thing in the vendor forum. The reason this was brought up is a vendor went to mark the item in transit as he had his order page opened for a few days and the order was there. When he went to mark it in transit obviously it refreshes and it did so and the order ...in the vendors words...vanished. Where as usually it go&#039;s below with your other orders in transit.<br /><br />So what had happened is it was past the 4 days, and the buyer did cancel it. This post had more then 15 responses before the answer of what happened to the order came about. As the vendor didn&#039;t at first realize the order was over the 4 day limit where a buyer can then cancel and didn&#039;t realize he was on his order page that had been left up in a tab for a few days with out being refreshed.<br /><br />So this is how I know the answer to your question. <br /><br />Also it has been brought up many of a time in the vendor forum about what happens to the buyer stats after 4 days and the buyer cancels vs the vendor cancelling. And the only difference is feedback can be left if the vendor cancels after 4 days where as if the vendor cancels before the 4 days, the buyer can not leave feedback. And there is nothing on the buyer stats that will be affected.

How would SR operate if buyers have been refunded yet vendor&#039;s still post out orders that have in fact been cancelled. It does address your other questions though.&nbsp; However, using some Common Sense, there would be something that takes place where the vendor is made aware of a cancelled order. Otherwise, there would be a lot of &quot;free&quot; drugs being received by buyers who cancelled their orders. <br /><br />If your not getting a response after numerous attempts, click on the &quot;report this vendor&quot; button at the top of their SR homepage and detail your complaint for the Admins.<br />

				No if you cancel, they don&#039;t get notification at all. You literally pass quietly into the night. <br /><br />And RX KING, pipe down with your self serving blowhardingismisticness. LOL. <br /><br />If you order late on a Friday which might be even later for them considering their time zone relative to yours, they don&#039;t ship weekends, and a vendor normally takes 48 hours to ship, come Monday, they already lost 2 days. <br /><br />Way to teach the newbs patience.<br /><br />BTW, I remember ordering a sample from you that never shipped when you first started. *shrug* it was free so whatevs.

				I personally would like to see the time limit before cancelling reduced to 48 hrs. I don&#039;t really see the problem for vendors.They can just mark &quot; in transit&quot; as soon as they begin to wrap package, (I&#039;m guessing most vendors will wrap and then post as soon as possible, as leaving wrapped addressed packages around for days would be a foolish thing to do).&nbsp; In theory I &#039;d like to see the ability to cancel available at ANY time before &quot;in transit&quot; but of course this would just end up with vendors marking &quot;in transit&quot; straight away and still not sending it for four days. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The current four days is a ridiculous length of time to have your money tied up by a vendor who has gone AWOL without warning. Of course if a particular vendor has issues meaning they usually take longer than that to process they can put that on their page. But usually, I think if your are getting backed up with orders more than 48 hrs you need to ramp up your process or take down your listing for a day or two.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ideal option ( although this might be difficult for the site admins to implement) would be a system where a vendor states current processing time on their page, and once that is passed, the buyer can cancel.<br />I mostly make domestic orders where it will come in a day or two once sent, and so an extra four days wait can seriously fuck my plans up. In the past I have messages vendors pre order to check their current processing time but obviously I am aware I&#039;m just delaying them further by making them answer my stupid questions.<br /><br />While I&#039;m having a rant: the feedback system is seriously fucked up. It&#039;s got to the stage where only if a vendor messages you saying &quot; look mate I have took your money and I ain&#039;t sending your drugs. Sucker!&quot; would you feel able to leave maybe a 4/5. I don&#039;t know what can be done about this; it seems to afflict all Internet shopping rating systems(eBay amazon etc) it&#039;s like some kind of ratings inflation

I have never giving a sample in my life. And going back to that time, 11 months ago, I gave away the King Koin and I gave people free shit that were dirtbags with no money or that would do shit for me in the forums, I did then give them free Xanax or free Norco&#039;s but that was people that messaged me and I agreed to give them something for the King Koin...and I always shipped to someone that I did that for. So don&#039;t say you ordered a sample from me because that NEVER DID HAPPEN. And I have never once said I would do something and not done it. NEVER. It is not how I roll. Hence me being here 1 year with perfect feedback.<br /><br />So come on back and respond as soon as you are done making a post in a thread just repeating the exact same thing that was said the 8 post before you...as it is very important to be reassured by you&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />&nbsp;:P<br />

It is like the great example Ben gave...if a vendor states they do not ship on Weekends and you know this, and you place an order at 9pm on Friday night...you should not send a message to the vendor on Sunday asking them why it was not shipped on Saturday.<br /><br />The OP in this case (if you read it)has&nbsp; had the order in there for over 4 days and the vendor will not return his messages, let alone read them, and clearly does not state on his account &quot; please place your order, then know I only ship once a month&quot;.&nbsp; So my answer that&nbsp; you quoted was never to be confused with a vendor that states they only ship xyz. Then it is on the buyer 100%. And I know this is a problem. As a lot of buyers do not read the listing(can&#039;t even believe that is true but it totally is) and even more do not read the vendor page for the shipping policy of that said vendor.<br /><br />But there is no excuse ever for a vendor that does not have something listed on his account saying he only ships x times to have an order for more then 4 days! NEVER. That is total bullshit. No buyer should ever have to wait 4 days or more to have an item shipped. Unless the vendor states so. And no vendor should mark&nbsp; &quot;in transit&quot;&nbsp; when in fact it is not even packages let alone on the way to the post office. I know this stuff is rare..but it is not rare enough. There are some really shitty vendors. There are some that I can&#039;t even believe the buyers still go there. Their rating is like 90 or some shit number and they still get business.<br /><br />Though the beauty of this place is that you can see what you are getting yourself into. I can&#039;t stand the people that order from a vendor like xxx for example, then come in here and complain about what has happened to them. When in fact the feedback score is 87 and if the buyer spent 5 min looking into the vendor, they would run the other way. <br /><br />So if somehow you did not understand that I in no way could be talking about vendors that list their shipping schedules as they only ship on X days then I am sorry. I figured that was just a total given that I could in no way be talking about them, but that is my bad as I forgot where I was and who i am dealing with.

				Yes, and what I was saying is I have no problem with vendors marking &quot;in transit&quot;immediately before they leave the house to mail the packages, to avoidthis happening. I pretty much assumed that all vendors do this anyway, for the very reason you describe.
