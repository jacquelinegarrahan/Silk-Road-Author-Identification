				Hey all. I read 1000 times vendors complaining about the crashes, and the money lost. But... what? only the new vendoors can complain. <br /><br />if a vendor had 5000 $ 4 months ago in his account, now, those 5000$, are worth like 10000$. but yes, 1 week ago they worth 20 000. <br /><br /><br />you sellers, your mistake was to sale when the price of BTC was more than 100$. you instead of receiving 5 btc per 1 order, you received 2 btc, per the same order. now, you&#039;re fucked because you have low bitcoin, that now, worth low $. <br /><br />dont complain because of the crash. complain because you couldn&#039;t stop selling when the price was going up and up, and you we&#039;re receiving almost no btc per orders.<br /><br />remember that only some months ago, btc was worth 12 or 15$. now, atm, its worth 64$ on bitstamp. <br /><br />Just my opinion. I never read a opinion like this on the forum.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />

				I dont consider this whole crash a huge loss, i mean, i cashed in most of my btc at a good price, i think around £110 each. I still have a few, and for every order i receive at the moment i seem to be losing out because bitcoin is dropping so fast. But hey, it all comes with the job. What can i do about it ? Nothing. So i take it all in my stride

				Not just that mate. What is happening right now to me is the incorrect value of SR&#039;s BTC compared to MtGox. Say I get paid $100 at the value of 1.2 BTC (in escrow) and I cash out the 1.2 BTC the next second with any local bitcoin exchange and they are only worth $70. The rate was like $70 (SR) compared to $58 (MtGox) just now. What I can do is just to wait for BTC to gain more strength or else I will be netted a loss if I cash out right away. Sorry for the grammar.
