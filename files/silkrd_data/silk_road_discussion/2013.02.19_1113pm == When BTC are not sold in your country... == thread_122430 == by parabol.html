				Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m having this problem for a while, I bought before from guys on the only à¸¿ web of my country but now no one have any. This has been the case for almost a month now. There are SR sellers that accept WU like DRG0NZO who seems like a very nice guy but he only sells a minimum of US500. Anybody have a similar issue and have managed a solution? Some have told me to buy via paypal, I don&#039;t like the idea, also the only way to put money in a paypal account here is by credit card, I don&#039;t own one and don&#039;t want to either.<br /><br />Thanks in advanced

				First off, buying BTC isn&#039;t illegal--so you can use Paypal, if you wanted to.&nbsp; The only way I know of that lets you do this is Virwox, and it&#039;s a bitch.<br /><br />Secondly, there are a ton of BTC vendors on SR.&nbsp; Just use them.&nbsp; (Make sure they are reputable, established, and have been here for a while by their feedbacks on the forum).

				try localbitcoins.com, message some one and ask if they will take WU, i am guessing many will, use the escrow system or go with a very reputable seller, preferably someone with a bitcoin-otc rating
