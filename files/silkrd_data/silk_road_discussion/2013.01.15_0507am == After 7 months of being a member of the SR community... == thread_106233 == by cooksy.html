				After being a member of SR for 7 months I have to say that this place is amazing. Granted there are issues from time to time but by and large the site runs very smooth considering how many people and organizations are trying to bring it down. I would imagine that there are only a handful of people responsible for keeping the site up and running and they do a fantastic job of resolving issues in a timely manner.&nbsp; Also I&#039;m really impressed with the SR community. Just 10 minutes ago a guy was short some coin and within 5 minutes some one had already helped him out of his jam. Makes me kinda wish we could just completely cut off the site from new members. Just wanted to express my thoughts about this utopia we are all apart of.

Its just that there seems to be a lot more shit heads on here than there was 6 months ago. Then again for every jackass theres probably a decent person that joins.

				even the tor website says the more tor users the more anonymity. so the more (useful, productive) users they accept in the more anonymous and harder to bring down we all are :)

				Same here! Been a member for 7 months now and it&#039;s awesome! Couldn&#039;t be more happy. Really is a utopia. Feel so free. I really and truly love this place. It gives me a sense of having ownership of my own body knowing that I have the choice to put what I want in MYSELF!<br />This place is way more than just a shop for illegal substances to me. It&#039;s extremely meaningful and makes me feel very proud to be part of it. I really do hope that one day I can contribute back to this sort of community. Whether it be legally in real life changing laws, or as a vendor on here. I will promise everyone that no matter what I&#039;ll be fighting for our side the hardest I can!<br /><br />Keep up the good work everyone! I really love those of you members out here that feel what I&#039;m saying!<br /><br />And as for closing membership, I&#039;ve thought of the same thing. Sounded like a good idea to keep things small and secret. But I only saw more problems coming out of it. I don&#039;t think SR would survive.<br />If this site is kept secure and stable as it is currently, I do not see a threat to keeping registration open for all. In other words, even if this was broadcasted on fox news tomorrow night and millions found out, as long as security is withheld (pgp) and traceability (money; bitcoins) is undetectable I cannot see the outside world being a threat. You hate us? Don&#039;t like drugs? GO AHEAD. What wrong have we done to you!?!<br /><br />I think we ALL should remember to not only support, use, and love SR, but to FIGHT for what SR is in your real life. Washington and Colorado are good examples of what I&#039;m talking about. Lets keep a check on these bastard politicians and abate the controlled substance list!!! I wish to see true freedom rain on all one day. I&#039;ll do my very best to brew up that storm!

If we cut ourselves off from newbies we&#039;d be at a great loss, all you need to do to see that is take a look at the PGP club, in pine&#039;s absence it&#039;s members such as astor and nightcrawler who have carried it on. Yes, there&#039;s scammers, trolls, and fools who plague our paradise, what we can do to make a difference is expose them for the good of everyone, and the big difference is SilkRoad listens to us, albeit sometimes it takes a little time because they&#039;re so inundated by enquiries and requests but they&#039;ll always come through in the end. I&#039;m happy I&#039;ve found this haven and feel privileged to have found it. Seriously (and what a lot of us often forget), if we&#039;re scammed IRL by a dodgy asshole in some dark street corner who is going to listen to us without getting ourselves into trouble in the process? There only needs to be a tight team of individuals running this no more, I can&#039;t imagine the amount of risk and stress DPR takes to trust someone. I also admire and thank thecrackhead for starting up the spare coins thread, there&#039;s a real community spirit there. I wish things progress onwards and upwards for us in 2013, godspeed DPR you&#039;re a true liberation patriot :)
