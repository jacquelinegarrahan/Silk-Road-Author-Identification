				Compared to buying in real life, I don&#039;t think SR is cheap at all.<br /><br />I buy weed from SR sellers in the UK.<br /><br />I like the convenience of SR.&nbsp; I like the fact that there is a selection of strains to choose from.<br /><br />However its at least 33-50% more expensive than buying it in real life.<br /><br />I like SR, but it isnt cheap.

				some shit is well priced some isn&#039;t. coke and dope are cheap by me. I can only speak on the quality of the coke but usually I&#039;d guess it to be in the 30% range sometimes higher 200 for a ball game. I heroin is super cheap 40 a bundle and way cheap if you buy a log. as for quality i cannot speak.

				The most economical thing on here that I&#039;ve noticed recently is MDMA. There are a few vendors selling incredible product at rock bottom prices, which is pretty awesome.

				So I noticed this phenomenon in the last couple weeks where&nbsp; both new members and fairly new vendors talking about MDMA suddenly everywhere almost constantly.<br /><br />Listen up, this is a setup.<br />IMo fake account members are asking how on earth can i make money on silkroad...then a slew of members say mdma sales IRL for profit.<br />Then suddenly there is massive amounts of MDMA on the markeplace for bulk sale out of no where.<br /><br />These indicates to me that there is a new attempt from an unused angle yet directed at to scam new members.<br />Maybe it&#039;s just LE.<br /><br />Either way this activity seems high dangerous without going to the top mdma vendors to inquire about bulk mdma purchases.<br />New vendors I&#039;m gonna assume are the scammers. Not that every new member is a scammer but this seems like a highly possible situation arising esp since NYE is so soon. We all know the scammers come out in force during holidays.<br /><br /><br /><br />Does this make any sense to anyone? My tinfoil hat got stolen.

				Scampony, that&#039;s always a possibility that we should be aware of, but a lot of SR buyers do resell IRL. If you&#039;re buying off SR, you have few or no or shitty RL connections, which means your friends are in the same boat. So if you can get something quality and/or cheap on SR, you have an instant local market.

				It&#039;s so annoying hearing people say that SR is too expensive. There&#039;s a lot of listings here that can make you bank.<br /><br />It seems like people go to the H or coke listings and then base everything on those prices.

				You got to go to dealers with some feedbacks like 20 or 30 if there cheap.&nbsp; Like a brand new with no FB could be risky. By the way there is bulk sellers that have there own customer base.&nbsp; Mostly overseas but fuck it its all good they know how to package shit.
