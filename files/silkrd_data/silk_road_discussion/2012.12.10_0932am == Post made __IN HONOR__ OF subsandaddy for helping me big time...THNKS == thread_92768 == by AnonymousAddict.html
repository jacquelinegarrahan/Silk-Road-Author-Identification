				I just cant help but speak more on this man and his kindness... I mean how many vendors would actually priority ship you somestuff to help you first thing and make it a top thing to do list? When i msg subs i told him bro i dont expect you to do it by no means your not obligated cause youv always looked out on when i order, well he msg me bak Nice as can be and said &#039;How bad off are you man?&quot; I explain to him and then went on to say bro i cant get any coins til late this week when i get money my x got my personal SR money stash confused and used it to buy my daughter Christmas, which by all means is ok my princess has plenty and&nbsp; being my only child,but i always put 300 in a part in my wallet and call it my SR STASH.. Well i made the mistake of handing the X (babymoma) the whole wallet cause me being fucked up on xanax and some of senecas PURE was in the electronic dept playing games. Well back in my truck I&nbsp; ask for my wallet and had over i think it was 2 grand in cash in it ,20bucks left!!! maybe a little more, but im like fuck!!! it its for my baby,i knw i got my sr stash,i look to make sure ITS GONE TO!!! THEN i started flipping, anxiety is kicking in and i cant tell the babymoma why im flipping, at this point im down to my last couple xanax bars from Irishdan and i get home and have no idea what to dooo1!! I get only $ right about 1000&nbsp; a week its just the way my trust is set up, so i knew i was gonna be sick,couldn&#039;t ask friends cause they would ask to many questions, so iturned to my vendor subs,,Told him tht story he understood and told me dont worry at all monday im sending you some things out to keep you well til your money comes in, i had a few nice ppl in the community offer to lend me a few coins and i THNK U ALL FOR THAT cause it helped me give subs some money for shipping, soo thank you subs your a great man of honor and virtue , I cant say enough about this man..Im not only going on cuz he is helping me hes helped me and hooked me up before but this just tops the cake and it deserves a THREAD ABOUT IT in HONOR OF HIM and how good a man he is and caring. Im actually gonna copy this whole post and make it in one more forum just cause i wanna rename it the proper way and i want subs to see it and now how thankful i am of him and his kind heart... Iv Always been the guy that has Loaned 10 + dollars here and there or whatever needed when i have it,and never asked for nothing back but to pss the karma to someone when they need it..Well the universe has a funny way of blessing good deeds,,And iv got a little surprise in for subs, he doesnt know what yet but hes gonna have a nice little something...Thanks man..and thak you for blessing me helping me get meds to not be sick...U ROCK!!
