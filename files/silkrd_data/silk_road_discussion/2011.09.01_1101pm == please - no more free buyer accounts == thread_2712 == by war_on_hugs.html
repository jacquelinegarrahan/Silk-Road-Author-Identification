				i know some sellers might be against charging 1 or 2 bitcoins for new users registering a buyer account, but if too many scammers just create new account everytime their feedback rating drops from scamming, then it defeats the purpose of buyer feedback.&nbsp;

				The market is already dealing with this issue.&nbsp; Now that we sellers have the information, we can structure our business models around it.<br /><br />I for one have a new policy that if a buyer has &lt;3 completed transactions with no isues I won&#039;t sell to them in escrow.&nbsp; If they want my product they have to pay upfront for it.&nbsp; I have enough of a rep now that people now I&#039;m not some dickless scammer fuck whose balls failed to drop, but that I&#039;m offering the best product I can find at a fair price.&nbsp; Over 3 transactions I&#039;m willing to do this the normal way, although I always offer discounts for out of escrow purchases since it means I get my cashflow that much sooner.<br /><br />I might eventually move to an out-of-escrow situation entirely in the future (or a you-release, I-ship situation).&nbsp; Probably after I&#039;ve cracked 150 or 200 transactions.

				but the problem is that a scammer can just buy a few low price items of&nbsp; &lt;1BTC then establish positive feedback and a false sense of honesty amongst sellers.

				True enough but so far I&#039;ve done about 5 out-of-escrow sales with my new policy and everyone seems happy.&nbsp; It&#039;s just another hoop a scammer has to jump through.&nbsp; &nbsp;

I&#039;m no PHD, and I easily found vendors I knew had a) excellent product, b) fast shipping, c) were trustworthy. This came from much reading in the forums. I have had 100% successful transactions, and within very short time frame, found my favorite vendors.<br /><br />Sorry, but if you&#039;re stupid enough to go buy blindly on the main SR page without any forethought or research, then I don&#039;t have much sympathy. Tor &amp; SR are not scamproof. Even when you install Tor, it advises you that you don&#039;t just &quot;download Tor and start surfing the web&quot;. SR, like Tor, requires time, effort and thought. It&#039;s kinda like all the people who signed those subprime mortgage contracts...And personally, if I was a seller on here, after a number of successful transactions with a steady stream of buyers, I&#039;d stick with them, no additional risk, and as long as the numbers make sense....dunno

				sorry i misworded my above response, (and edited it) i meant to say that prospective buyers (which have the intention of scamming) can just buy low priced items and look legit. i don&#039;t think there is as much of a problem with scamming sellers as there is with scamming buyers. especially since seller accounts cost about $100

				I got what you were saying, I am just saying so far it seems okay.&nbsp; If it becomes a problem I&#039;m moving to a you-release, I-ship sort of deal.&nbsp; So far so good, though.

				Both sellers and buyers should use all resources available to them. There&#039;s no one solution to ending scamming, but the number of controls SR has given both buyer and seller is unprecedented in the online drug scene. Its not perfect, but ending buyer accounts makes no sense. The whole idea is an open and free market.... not a market for the first 50k people to sign up.

				Perhaps user accounts are free to browse and look - but to be able to buy you have to put like 1-5btc in escrow with the Silk Road permanently to cover if you turn out to try and scam a vendor or your using the account as a seller trying to attack your competitors (cough cough if the douche who recently tried that on me wants to come forward now is a good time). Its a fair deterrent with a way to hopefully provide some minimal compensation to vendors being screwed. Then as a vendor between their purchase ratio we now have for buyers we can refuse larger orders till their a trusted buyer. Just my 2 cents.
