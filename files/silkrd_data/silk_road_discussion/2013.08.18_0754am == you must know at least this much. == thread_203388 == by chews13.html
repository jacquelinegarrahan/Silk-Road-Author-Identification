				does anyone remember those signs the said you have to be at least this tall to ride. <br />well there should be a test or something where you have to know at least this much to ride down this road. I&#039;m not stating you should understand everything about how the road works but, you should at least know pgp, how to get your btc safely, and what to do if you get a controlled delivery and what to say which is NOTHING, and also to not post your silkroad habbits on clear net sites talking to you Facebook/Reddit users. Once you know these small, mostly simple things then you should be able to get take a ride on the silkroad. Too many young people talk way to much about this place and it will be the down fall. there was an article where a 14 year old mother turned him in.<br /><br /><br />sorry for the rant but I don&#039;t won&#039;t to lose this place to people who don&#039;t know how, when, or why.

				As much as I appreciate your opinion let me say this. <br /><br />First. Fuck facebook and any of the like. If you care that much about someone&#039;s life or think they do about yours then you are already up shit creek with no paddle. <br />Second. Why would any of this fall under the responsibility of SR? SR is merely a vehicle to arrive at a destination. It is up to the user to take the correct path. The info is readily available on the forums and there are many here who will even help you if you still don&#039;t understand. Anyone who is dumb enough to jump right in without properly researching first deserves any problems that come with it.&nbsp; As for potential backlash on the vendor because of a dumb buyer, well that goes both ways. Any good vendor will have their shipping security so tight that aside from physically watching them drop that package it will be virtually impossible to trace it back to them. Again, research must be done to find who those vendors are and again the info is readily available. <br /><br />Like I said, I respect your opinion but I tend to look at it this way. The herd is going to be thinned regardless and that usually starts with the weak.&nbsp; As long as you run a tight ship you have very little to worry about. LE can go after those who are careless and bust them. Then they can talk about how they are making a difference and all that other bull shit. <br /><br />Silk Road has weathered quite a few storms and doesn&#039;t appear to be going anywhere. If it were to be threatened I would hope it takes a little bit more than social media to do it. Take it upon yourself to be safe and secure. Then sit back and enjoy the ride.

				If someone hears about SR, its either because they know someone who has personally used it (in which case that person will hopefully train them, or at least handle the ordering for them), or they heard about it in the newsmedia like the forbes article. If the latter case is true, all but the dumbest of people will do a fair amount of reading before they place any order. I had my first account almost a full year before I ever ordered anything, I kept my eyes on these forums to see what kinda of drama went on, whos getting busted, who the good vendors are, etc, etc. <br /><br />I think what would help is having a standard guide for buyers (and eventually sellers too) that covers EVERYTHING, and having that guide available in as many languages as possible. Such a guide should be featured prominently on all things SR (main site, reddit, forums, anything else), maybe even have it as a banner or like one of those annoying pop ups that newspaper websites have to try to get you to pay for them. I&#039;m Kidding about that last one, but seriously, it should be obvious that this guide is what any new user should read, and it should cover every step in full detail. <br /><br />We already have the basic template and most of the content needed, its just a matter of putting it all in one place and hopefully getting DPR&#039;s stamp of approval for it.
