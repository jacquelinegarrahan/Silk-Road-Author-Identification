				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />Thanks for the warm welcome back.&nbsp; Ben is back in his element and I must say it&#039;s more like nothing ever happened than it is like something bad has happened and things have changed.&nbsp; I think work is really helping him mentally and emotionally and everyone can look forward to getting their orders shipped tomorrow. :)<br /><br />A few people have pm&#039;ed me and said our PGP key was missing from our page.&nbsp; I checked, and I&#039;ll be damned, they&#039;re right!&nbsp; I guess I somehow deleted it when I was updating all the other stuff on the page but it is back there now and it&#039;s the same old one so you know this isn&#039;t some LE trick or anything. <br /><br />A LOT of people pm&#039;d today so give me a chance, I&#039;m gonna work really late tonight and see if I can&#039;t catch up but it may take till sometime tomorrow.<br /><br />So our PGP key is back on the sellers page, orders so far will 100% get shipped out, and I&#039;m working the pm&#039;s as fast as my fingers will carry me.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s all for now, take care,<br />Alex

				Thanks for fixing that, haha! Luckily I found you&#039;re PGP pretty easily by searching through the forums, but it&#039;s nice to know it&#039;s correct.&nbsp; ;D

				That&#039;s good news concerning Ben. Thanks for letting us know how he&#039;s doing. He&#039;s in my thoughts. <br /><br />As for your PGP key, luckily I keep a copy of yours in a safe place. After two failed drives in as many months, I learned to keep backups of those little, yet important, things. :)

				&nbsp;;) Thanks Alex for confirming with us and putting the PGP key back up!!&nbsp; And thanks to some helpful members of the forum such as @dman420 for finding your PGP key elsewhere on the forum and posting it in an easier to find location for all our encryption purposes...<br /><br />:) :) Happy to see orders are going out Monday!! :) :)
