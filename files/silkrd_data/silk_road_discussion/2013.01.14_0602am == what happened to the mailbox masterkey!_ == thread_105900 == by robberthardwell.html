				The only reason you would need&nbsp; a masterkey is to steal something that doesn&#039;t belong to you, probably why it was deleted.<br />If you have lost your own key, than call a locksmith.

The point of a masterkey is to send your orders to a address belonging to someone else. You then use the key to get your product, and if the address comes under suspicion of police there will be no evidence that the resident had anything to do with it.

				Still would cause more problems than it would solve..<br />What happens when the unsuspecting person opens their mailbox sees strange package, opens it&nbsp; out of curiosity and finds drugs, calls the police or takes it for themselves, then the person asks for refund of 50% for non receipt..

				While we&#039;re on this topic I have a question...Why do the &quot;masterkeys&quot; only work on some boxes. For example; There is two style of keys I have noticed given out at post offices, one has a round head and the other is rectangular, the &quot;masterkey&quot; only works on the ones with the round head in my area and not on the others. Anyone have any input on that or know where I can get a key that works for the rectangular shaped key style boxes?
