While journalists and human rights activists use the network, it has also been the tool of choice for online sellers of arms and drugs, such as the market leader The Silk Road which bans any use of child abuse images.&quot;<br /><br />You know you&#039;re on the way to acceptance when you&#039;re called the market leader without any trace of sarcasm or hysteria - even if they got the arms bit wrong.

				Love this place.&nbsp; I actually think this is better than pseudo-legalization (you know, where it&#039;s legal to have but not sell/buy with an MMJ card) ::).&nbsp; <br /><br />This place is perfect for personal amounts buyers such as myself who don&#039;t want to deal with the fuckery of irl dealing. To boot: the quality is top notch for the price. I&#039;ve gotten the best weed in my life off the road, and it was about 1/2 the price per gram while being 2x the quality.<br /><br />

How in the hell did you know that I had even mentioned you here? I guess you must have just seen it on the off chance but I certianly didn&#039;t think you would see that comment this quickly. Thanks again for the plus one there too btw!! Your article was great, I had no idea about the history of bitcoins and how the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding their origin. <br /><br />It&#039;s sad those guys were your friends and I&#039;m really sorry for your lose. I&#039;ve had basically an average of two friends die per year nearly over the last ten years and most of them being drug related fatalities. I also apologize for the insensitive comments that I made here amongst the forums around the time of their deaths. You&#039;d think that I&#039;d be a little more sensitive to the issue and it&#039;s easy to rip on somebody you&#039;ve never even known. Not making excuses though but my motive for making such comments was soley based on the negative attention that it bought SR and it further driving SR and Darknet as a whole in further disrepute. And it&#039;s actually evident in the comments themselves. But again, I apologize whole-heartedly.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad we&#039;ve got you on our side anyway mate!

				If we had more pro-SR journalists and other people of highly esteemed vocations I believe we&#039;d be in a better position for the petitioning of an overhaul in Australian drug policy. I mean have you ever looked into the Australia Heroin Trial proposal of 1996? <br />There was a petition signed by literally HUNDREDS of people from the walks of life I speak of. I&#039;m talking Doctors, Harm Reduction advocates, Ex-Police Commissioners, Chief Magistrates, Ex-DPP&#039;s, Former State &amp; Federal Ministers signed this petition in favour of trialing a prescription Heroin program in 1996. <br />This doesn&#039;t include the every day citizens who were in favour of this trial, these are people in positions that deal with the affects of Heroin on society every day of the week. These are the people who&#039;s opinions are most valued on the matter.<br />You want to know how many people weren&#039;t in favour of the Heroin trials. Four. That&#039;s right, four, the number between two and three. They were John Howard (Prime Minister of the time), Piers Akerman (Cock-sucker journalist for the Daily Telegraph Newspaper), The General of the Salvation Army of the time and some other fucking Bozo. Hardly experts on the matter in comparison. <br /><br />Some how four bone heads with no professional background in the area have managed to over-rule a majority vote of experts in the very field of the debate. And instead of helping countless addicts get their lives in order we were force-fed the &quot;We will not be giving free Heroin out to drug addicts&quot; stance and were instead left with the Heroin injecting rooms in Kings Cross as the fucking booby-prize. There&#039;s a massive void between a proven succesful maintenance program and a designated place to shoot up.<br /><br />Rant over..

Hopefully somebody can help me out with URL for the thread. <br /><br />I really think that as long we&#039;ve got journalists like Ozfreelancer who make their presence known and who are down for the cause can only be an asset to our community. After all, there&#039;s already enough mainstream media journalists standing in line to punch SR&#039;s credibility about the place. <br /><br />Can anyone point me in the way of that article again please? I hope Ozfreelancer skims across this thread as I know she can provide the link.<br /><br />Anyways take it easy everybody...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well how could I not +1 you after that little write-up :) <br /><br />The article in question can be found here: http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/the-outlaw-cult-20130709-2po5j.html&nbsp; It was originally open to comments, but I don&#039;t know what happened to them. <br /><br />Little titbit - the guys who jumped off the Rialto were mates of mine - I was there to see it (spectacular, BTW&nbsp; 8) ).&nbsp; It was my little joke to work them into the article; I wasn&#039;t sure they would make it through the editing process!&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />x Eiley<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ah there you are!! How in the hell did you know that I had even mentioned you here? I guess you must have just seen it on the off chance but I certianly didn&#039;t think you would see that comment this quickly. Thanks again for the plus one there too btw!! Your article was great, I had no idea about the history of bitcoins and how the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding their origin. <br /><br />It&#039;s sad those guys were your friends and I&#039;m really sorry for your lose. I&#039;ve had basically an average of two friends die per year nearly over the last ten years and most of them being drug related fatalities. I also apologize for the insensitive comments that I made here amongst the forums around the time of their deaths. You&#039;d think that I&#039;d be a little more sensitive to the issue and it&#039;s easy to rip on somebody you&#039;ve never even known. Not making excuses though but my motive for making such comments was soley based on the negative attention that it bought SR and it further driving SR and Darknet as a whole in further disrepute. And it&#039;s actually evident in the comments themselves. But again, I apologize whole-heartedly.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad we&#039;ve got you on our side anyway mate!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Um, I think you misunderstood me!&nbsp; The guys I mentioned in my article who jumped James-Bond style off a tall building in Melbourne (with parachutes) and got away with it were my mates.&nbsp; No loss involved. ::)

				Oh shit, sorry I thougt you were talking about the guy who thought he could &quot;fly&quot; and jumped to his death on the fake LSD/ 25i-NBOME thing earlier this year. My bad. Yeah I definitely misunderstood you there!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I didn&#039;t even hear of these exploits to be truthful so maybe you can see how I came to the conclusion that that&#039;s what you were talking about.

He&#039;s from my area. Man he&#039;s crashed some big events, Michael Hutchins&#039; funeral being one of them. Wimbeldon, The Melbourne Cup etc.&nbsp; You know the guy is a delusional schizophrenic with austism? It&#039;s demonstrated in day to day conversation with the man. He&#039;s a really misunderstood dude, people don&#039;t even bother to take the time to get to know him. Most people think he&#039;s the full quid and just does this stuff to be a general nuisence but he truly believes that he&#039;s doing &quot;devine work&quot;.<br /><br />Haha anyway that&#039;s my claim to fame. That and the fact that I used to kick with Abbi Cornish back when she used to date a mate of mine prior to hooking up with Ryan Phillipe (or however it&#039;s spelt). Believe it or not she used to rap in my mates hip hop crew. She&#039;s got skills to.<br /><br />Ok I&#039;ve said enough.

				Sorry I got my back up over that but I thought you were calling me a junky. It&#039;s a little hard to interprete what you said as a joke in all honesty. But being as that we don&#039;t know eachother I&#039;ll have to give you the benefit of the doubt and take your word for it. <br /><br />I hate using them myself but maybe in future an emoticon might not hurt in order to properly convey the context of your message? ???<br /><br />One of the few times an emoticon is actually required and for some reason my friggin&#039; emoticons aren&#039;t displaying atm.
