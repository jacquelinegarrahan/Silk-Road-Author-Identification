				Okay, so unfortunately HardHustle never got around to my resolution center dispute, so now SR staff are going to deal with it. It was marked &quot;under review&quot; about an hour ago, how long does it usually take them? I&#039;d rather not have the staff wait for HH to reply... because who in the fuck knows how long that&#039;ll be.

				it shouldnt take too long, only been in resolution once, but usually it was quick while they were reviewing<br /><br />since support has been behind on messages idk they may also be behind on addressing resolution too though so maybe a day <br /><br />mine was for a non arrival though, so they just decided to extended the wait period, which was quick. when they chose a refund it was fairly quick too though<br /><br />in your case depending on if it arrived or not you may be right they might wait to try to hear from hard hustle, but likely they will just extend the wait as well to see if your order arrives. then if he fails to respond they should just accept whatever refund you proposed if its reasonable after a couple days <br /><br />so if it didnt arrive first propose an extension to see if its just taking some time unless there are multiple reports of him not shipping. then if you cant get a response from him after the extension propose 100 percent and if he still doesnt respond you will probably get all your money back - but it will take a little time so have some patience
