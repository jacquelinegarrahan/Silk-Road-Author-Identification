				passing a weed test is hard. THC stays in your system for weeks depending on your personal metabolism. Generally the fatter you are, low metabolism, the longer the THC stays in your system, possibly more than 4 to 6 weeks. I&#039;ve heard of drinking lots of water and peeing a lot. I doubt that works since THC is fat soluble, meaning water does nothing to THC. One effective method to increase your metabolism is to exercise. This will increase your metabolism so your body can burn through the THC stored in your fat. And you get healthy at the same time. But of course exercise is not a solution if you just smoked and have a piss test tomorrow morning. So I suggest all potheads to work out like a monster and have 5% body fat so that THC will pass right through your body. I find smoking and swimming to be very fun. Everyone should try it.

				What i have seen first hand from my brother (i have never tried it) two days before the scheduled test he buys 2 packs of water (the ones with 24-28 bottles in each) he drinks one case the first day and the second case on the 2nd day and he always passed idk how because i was always told that water doesn&#039;t do shit to clean your system but my brother has done this constantly with 2-3 different jobs and he&#039;s never failed the test...

				here&#039;s an idea for you. buy a camelback, the water containers that is a backpack. put it on underneath a coat so no one can see you have a camelpack underneath your coat. have a clean friend pee into the camelback. run the tube of the camelback through your sleeve. go into the bathroom and shoot your friend&#039;s clean piss from the camelback into the cup. fucking genius!<br /><br />

				I&#039;m gonna focus specifically on urine testing...<br /><br />There are two main types of urine tests used to identify THC metabolites in the system. The first is the classic &quot;dipstick&quot; style test and the second is a much more involved and significantly more expensive Gas Chromatography. Companies that rely on drug testing for the workplace, Parole tests etc, will use both. The cheaper dipstick style test is commonly used to &quot;prescreen&quot; samples, and if the sample shows positive, it is then subjected to a Gas Chromatography to determine exactly how much. Dip stick style tests will generally require 3 to 4 times the amount of metabolites to return a positive than a Gas Chromatography. Obviously, the test must be passed at the dipstick level.<br /><br />There are two methods, and only two methods, that work to pass a urine test for THC. One is foolproof. The other is risky. I will outline both.<br /><br />1. The risky method. Dilution. The goal here is to dilute your urine so much that the metabolites are lowered below the threshold the dipstick will trigger a positive result on. This method has several problems. The testee must drink serious quanitities of water, with the quantities required increasing substantially based on consumption. Drinking 1 gallon+ water in the hours leading up to your test will cause your urine to be clear, which many professional testing organizations will treat as a positive. Many testers will also check the Specific Gravity of your urine, which will tell them you are diluting in an attempt to pass the test. The only way to protect against this is to take massive multi-vitamins the day of the test. Don&#039;t overdo the Vitamin C as your urine will turn too yellow, but take 300-500% daily allowance of B vitamins and C, this will give your diluted urine the proper color to not arouse suspicion. This does not solve the issue of specific gravity, the only way to increase that is to take a large dose of Creatine every day for the three days leading up to the test. This will raise the specific gravity enough that it won&#039;t arouse suspicions in its diluted state. This method is ENTIRELY dependent on passing at the dipstick stage, if they send it to Gas Chromatography you&#039;re fucked because they&#039;ll notice the jacked up levels of creatine and vitamins in your urine. This method is what all of your pre-canned &quot;pass the test&quot; style drinks rely on to pass... diluting the urine while giving high doses of vitamins and supplements to maintain creatine and color. Very risky, not one I&#039;d recommend when there is a 100% sure way to pass.<br /><br />2. The guaranteed method. Quick Fix artificial urine. This is a lab created urine that is used to calibrate Gas Chromatagraphs in labs across the country. Fake urine is aboslutely undetectable from healthy regular urine. Using fake urine will handily beat both types of tests with no risk. The key here is to heat it per instructions in the microwave to appropriate temperature, then tape it or secure it in your underwear right at taint level. If you are on probation or parole you may have to test with someone watching you, in which case you may need a version complete with fake appendage to use. Many brands but the only one I’ve ever used is Quick Fix.<br /><br />Notes<br />*The tests don&#039;t test for THC. They test for the metabolites that are left as a result of your body&#039;s processing of THC, so the fat solubility of THC is irrelevant<br />**Always give urine from mid stream if doing option #1 and NEVER give first urine of the day.<br />***Most testing places will test for temperature of the urine, beware of this... too hot or too cold and it&#039;ll get refused. always make it extra hot and then let it cool before pouring it in the specimen cup. Quick Fix comes with a temp tab on the container and a heating pack you can rubber band to it to keep it above 98 until you need it, just remove the heat pack, wait for it to fall to 98, then pour in the specimen cup.<br /><br />Sorry, rambling. I&#039;m high. peace and good luck!

				I&#039;ll add to demosthenes dilution method with some things I&#039;ve read and had friends try. Never had to use these methods personally, but its worked for other people I know and the reasoning is sound. <br /><br />First off, drink lots of water. Up to a gallon in the 24hours preceding your test is a good goal, like demosthenes said. Avoid any strenuous exercise for the day or two before your test. THC metabolites are stored in your fats and strenuous exercise will cause these to be released during exercise and for a while afterwards. If your piss is super diluted, that raises a red flag and will likely have them either make you retest or forward the sample on for a GCMS lab test. Both of those are obviously bad. So, now that your piss is diluted, you need to make it look like its not diluted. 1-2 hours before your test, you should mix up a drink containing water, sugar, and creatine. Also like demosthenes said, take B and C vitamins but not a shit load. This will make your piss yellow, but if you take too much it will be crazy bright yellow and arouse suspicion. <br /><br />Ok, so you want this pre-test drink to have sugar, and a bunch of it. Like 50g or so. This will cause your body to release a large amount of insulin to maintain your blood sugar levels. Insulin prevents your body from releasing fats into the blood stream, which means no THC metabolites released into your blood for a couple hours, and all that extra water should have flushed all everything out of your blood stream by now. <br /><br />Finally, creatine. Its the stuff that bodybuilders and other athletes use. You can get it at Walmart, GNC, etc. Creatine will help make your piss seem like it is not diluted. Creatine is naturally in a lot of foods we eat, and is broken down into creatinine then removed from the body if our urine. All this extra water you have been drinking will have flushed all the creatinine out of your bloodstream. If they can&#039;t detect any creatinine in your piss, it will raise suspicions. Exactly how much creatine to take is not an exact science, I would say about 2.5g will probably be right. Too much creatine will raise your creatinine levels way above normal. If your creatinine levels are too high, they might ask you about it. If this happens, tell them you work out and have been taking creatine supplements.<br /><br />Simplified:<br />1. Drink a shit ton of water to flush THC metabolites out of your blood.<br />2. A few hours before your test, make and drink a mixture of water, sugar, creatine, B and C vitamins<br />-sugar creates insulin which stops more THC from getting into your blood<br />-creatine, B and C vitamins make your piss looks like its not super diluted<br />3. PISS<br />4. If they ask about creatine, tell them you take it because you work out<br />5. FUCKIN PASSED<br /><br />Also the fake piss works great, but this works great if you can&#039;t get fake piss in time and there is no risk of getting the temperature wrong or having them see your fake piss.

				I have passed a test using the dilution method with B Vitamins to keep my piss yellow and creatine so as they test for creatine amounts to see if you have diluted or not.<br /><br />It worked fine but there is always a risk, don&#039;t worry about drinking 24 hours before the test, start drinking water 4 hours before the test, you will be pissing every ten minutes but its just part of the deal. There are some good guides on exactly what times to do what etc on the clearnet.

Linden<br />Diagnostic Laboratory Services, Inc., HI, 96701, USA<br />Objectives: From the beginning of drug testing, substance abusers tried to avoid detection, presenting challenges to laboratory specimen collectors and analysts. Submission of synthetic rather than authentic urine became, at least in some geographical areas, far more prevalent than usage of adulterant additives. This presentation summarizes our laboratory’s initial physical identification of suspected synthetic urine from daily workplace drug testing samples. Suspicious samples were analyzed for low level uric acid and normalized to creatinine to obtain a ratio identifying synthetic urine specimens.<br />Materials and Methods: Initially, samples suspected of being synthetic were identified by unusual color, clarity and absence of foaming when shaken. These samples were analyzed for creatinine, urea and uric acid. The most common missing component in these samples was uric acid. Subsequently, 250 pre-employment and random forensic workplace urine drug testing samples were analyzed for uric acid and creatinine on an Olympus AU680 analyzer to establish an average population uric acid / creatinine ratio (UA/CR). An invalid-specimen threshold UA/CR ratio was established at 30% below the lowest observed population ratio.<br />Quantification of uric acid was performed on 0.5 mL aliquots of random human urine utilizing a spectrophotometric analysis developed by Beckman Coulter (modification of the Fossati method) for the Olympus (now Beckman-Coulter) AU 680 automated chemistry analyzer. Creatinine was also measured spectrophotometrically on the same instrument, and aliquot, utilizing a Siemens modified Jaffe reaction.<br />Results: The average random population (n=254) tested had an average Uric Acid / Creatinine ratio of 0.43, Median of 0.41, Std. Dev. 0.15, Range 0.15 – 1.23. The discriminated UA/CR ratio was established at &lt; 0.10 to identify synthetic urine. In the absence of a confirmatory method, these specimens were reported as Invalid, in the context of the definition from the Dept. of Health and Human Services Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (2004). The synthetic urine population (n=319) had an average creatinine value of 76.5 mg/dL and uric acid level of 0.3 mg/dL, resulting in an average UA/CR ratio less than 0.004.<br />Conclusion: In approximately 10,000 forensic urine workplace drug tests collected in the Hawaiian Islands, Guam and Saipan and analyzed from Oct 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011, nearly 2% were synthetic urine. To the best of our knowledge, we believe only our laboratory and at two Oregon laboratories are testing for synthetic urine in the U.S. If this percentage of synthetic urine was extrapolated to the entire country, then there is a high probability that a large number of individuals are “beating the drug test.” This potentially is a problem far exceeding that caused by any urine adulteration product currently being tested in U.S. drug testing laboratories.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				That information does not prove that what they are finding is actually synthetic urine, simply urine that is &quot;out of whack&quot; as far as uric acid, which could very easily be caused by the dilution method and would also account for the off-color of many of the samples, was labelled as &quot;fake&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp;Nothing talks about their methodology to determine that fake urine has low uric acid, or what brands of fake urine they are testing for. They simply state that based on the ASSUMPTION that fake urine will have low uric acid to creatinine ratios that a bunch of samples were faked. What was their control group? What brands of fake urine did they test to determine that they ratio&#039;s outside of the norm?<br /><br />Two things to consider <br />1. I have personally used synthetic urine to pass urine tests administered both by DLS and Quest Diagnostics, both leading companies in the drug testing market place. Passed both with flying colors, one was the night after bonging much bubble hash. <br />2. This company DLS, is one of the kingpin&#039;s of the drug testing marketplace. Of course they are going to assure their clients they can catch anything and everything. They&#039;d lose millions, if not billions if they didn&#039;t.<br /><br />Again, as I said in the post, passing the test at the dipstick stage is what is needed, and a good quality synthetic urine will do that.<br /><br /><br />
