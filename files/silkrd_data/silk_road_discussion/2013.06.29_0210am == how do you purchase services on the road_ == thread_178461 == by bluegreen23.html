				So it&#039;s very easy to go through escrow and purchase goods.<br /><br />But how do you purchase services? <br /><br />Lets say I wanted to anonymously post 3 things on 2 different clearnet sites. Nothing that was going to be posted was illegal, trolling, hate speech or anything of the like. A person could use tor to log into the blogs/forums etc and post 1 of the 3 posts on each site. Then a second person to post the second thing on each site and a 3rd person to do the third part. <br />Think of this as a diffusion of information. insurance that the 3 posts of information could never lead back to 1 person. <br /><br />How do I buy someone on here? I mean do I just msg people that fit my criteria (trusted members here) that are not from the US and go from there?

				Currently it pays 0, but thats because I don&#039;t really know how to do this without breaching SR escrow system. Like, I don&#039;t want to go outside of SR. If I&#039;m going to pay someone from the road, then the road should be able to take it&#039;s cut right? (support the road!!) <br /><br />But in theory it would be like 1 bitcoin. and it would involve copy and pasting about 2-5 lines of text, on 2-3 forums. So it would involve creating a profile for each forum as well. Again, nothing illegal, or false, no hate speech or statements regarding any persons, governments, corporations, groups or other entities. The profiles can be tossed, deleted, or whatever else after the posts are up. All done through tor, and hopefully the person would be smart enough to make a throw away email so that after the posts go up everything can be never accessed again. Anyways this doesn&#039;t matter so much at the moment. I need to know how to stay within the confines of SR.<br /><br />I mean do I have to get a vendor profile for something this small and 1 time use? is there some other way to do this?

				I have never done it but logic would say you treat it like any other transaction. Have them set up a listing, purchase it, when they do their required post or whatever, and you verify it, then release the funds? What&#039;s so complicated?

				well 1 setting up a vendor account just for that 1 time transaction. seems a bit of a waste in all honesty. Guess it is the only way.<br /><br />
