				Hi there<br /><br />I&#039;m an Australian woman working in the medical community and was very wary about using silk road (it could cost me my career, not just my job) but I went with&nbsp; Aussie seller Enter the Matrix and was v. impressed re quality and shipping. It is MUCH BETTER&nbsp; IMHO to pay a bit more and go with a trusted/highly rated seller than risk other options. And, he also gave me some impressive freebies for my custom! Many thanks Matrix. Will you marry me??? Love from Nurse.Jackie

				In my experience with my Australian friend, Australian customs are fascist and I would NOT recommend ordering anything even remotely illegal. My friend had multiple orders of DXM seized, a nitrous cracker, 2c-i hidden in a cd case. The only thing that ever went through was a scale and a tiny amount of 2c-e I hid in a different cd. And he never got a seizure letter for any of them. <br />And then he bitches at me saying the very trusted vendors are scammers. No buddy, your country are a bunch of fascists. This is coming from an American too.<br /><br />I would say if you are Australian, DO NOT use Silk Road or attempt to order anything even remotely illegal. Or even looks illegal. Their police power is pretty much unlimited. Sorry. Your just gonna waste your money.<br /><br />When Americans customs seized one of my packages (not through Silk Road), I got a nice Love Letter from them and had a fun time explaining to the people I live with about it.

				My friends had multiple things seized by Australian customs. And he wasent even ordering explicitly illegal things. And hes not the only one to run afoul of Australian Customs. This is my experience from the research chemical scene.<br /><br />Now if you arent ordering illegal things, or ordering from a domestic supplier, you should be ok. Otherwise your just gonna risk losing your money, at best.

Hell, they even have their own show about it! But she stated she lives in Australia and used an Australian based seller so it&#039;s all domestic. No need for all this scaremongering.

Ask the many nurses who do nightshift. Fuck you&#039;re a naive prick and from reading most of your post your a kid selling and buying on this site, thats been established.<br /><br />You&#039;re a fucken vendor you silly prick, of course you are going to stick by your fellow vendors about prices.<br /><br />I have put forth many reasons why, but it won&#039;t get through to you because as i just alluded, you&#039;re a vendor. It is in your BEST interest to make as much money as possible, to scam as much and to mark up as much in such a market like SR.<br /><br />Now i have no issue with other stuff, but xanax and the massive mark ups by aussie sellers compared to OS sellers is just fucken a rort.<br /><br />Poor you can&#039;t stand doctors, well for your sake i hope you get over this phobia cause as you get older and all this drug taking starts taking it&#039;s toll you will have to sit in the waiting room amongst all those coughing kids.<br /><br />And i really think you are the one using mummy and daddy electricity to earn your tidy profits, after all you keep insisting with using hater, that most immature of internet retorts possible.

				I hope the US doesn&#039;t adapt any Aussie border policies anytime soon. I&#039;m actually surprised you guys have an obstacle that we don&#039;t.<br /><br />US dealers of Xanax are getting the pills anywhere from 5 to 75 cents a piece. Its a pill half the country has been prescribed at one point in the past 10 years. Its ridiculous that Australians are forced to pay so much based on political ignorance or corruption. Surprised they have any vendors at all. But thumbs up to those helping out over there!<br /><br />P.S. I&#039;ve seen ETM around the market, and doesnt look a scammer to me.. Why is demsone even saying that?
