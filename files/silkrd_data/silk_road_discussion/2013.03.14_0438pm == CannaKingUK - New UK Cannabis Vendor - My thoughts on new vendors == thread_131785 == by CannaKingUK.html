				I&#039;ve been reading these forums a lot over the past few weeks, and there seems to be complete and utter discontent for the wave of new UK cannabis vendors. People not receiving their orders, coupled with poor communication, with those vendors names and reputations being slashed and torn beyond repair. Scary times for new vendors starting out. Get it right or GTFO seems to be the message permeating from the threads.<br /><br />Well, I&#039;m a new UK vendor. I have everything I need to start up trading, just waiting to harvest my latest crop (I only activated my account this early because of the price of BTC, I figured they&#039;d peaked, and they had!:) ).&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering why the hell these new vendors haven&#039;&#039;t planned their new business properly? Are they teenagers trying to make some money and falling down on the professionalism? Is it complete lack of business sense? Are they just here to scam people?&nbsp; Do they not have any idea of the OPPORTUNITY they have before them thanks to BTC and DPR &amp; the SR team? These questions are all valid, but also completely unanswerable in an anonymous market place.<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent the last 2-3 months researching, familiarising, researching, reading, researching, asking questions, researching. You get the message. I&#039;ve been working hard to build a supply chain of everything I need to stealthily deliver your product, on time, within 24-48 hours of you clicking &#039;add to cart&#039;. I literally have enough in stealthy P&amp;P for the first 200 orders. I didn&#039;t want to leave anything to chance.<br /><br />I won&#039;t be able to supply one gram of product for at least another 6-8 weeks. But rather than sit there twiddling my thumbs, I&#039;m getting out there (on here), trying to show all my prospective customers that I am here for good! I&#039;ve been growing for a number of years now and have always had a fantastic response from my customers. And they keep coming back, time and time again. Why? I&#039;m a friendly guy. I turn up when I say I&#039;m going to turn up. I bring exactly the amount they ordered. I even carry around a little bit of change in case they don&#039;t have the correct money. The way I see it, I&#039;m a businessman, not a dealer. I produce a product off my own back, using my own skills. I market it, I run my own quality control, I price it, I bag it, I deliver it. It&#039;s not that hard to do... if you&#039;re professional.<br /><br />The way I see it, BTC&#039;s and SR have created a hole in space time. It feels like we&#039;re in the Wild West, a new frontier. I have a product that I produced with my own hands using my own skills, and you want some. No Government regulation, no red tape, no tax, and using BTC&#039;s and Tor, it&#039;s pretty much anonymous. New vendors should be appreciative of the opportunity before them, as I do.<br /><br />I believe the key to a successful vendor account on SR is professionalism. Fail to be professional, and you will fail as a vendor.<br /><br />CKUK

				Have you thought about shipping outside the UK??&nbsp; Like, to the US perhaps?<br /><br />I have made a few attempts to try and score some UK weed from SR, but run into very high prices always coupled with FE..&nbsp; The way I see it is, if JOR can get hash to me here, then someone can send me a couple grams of cheese w/ no problem.<br /><br />Now, you may be wondering..&nbsp; Why would someone from the US want weed from the UK?&nbsp; <br /><br />I just like seeing whats available in different places.&nbsp; Also, I have spent some time in a major UK city, and the only time I was able to find weed there..&nbsp; It was wet, uncured and was pretty much garbage.&nbsp; I was told by some of the locals to stay away from the hash..&nbsp; But I am certain that there is some really nice, British grown weed, I just wanna find it!&nbsp; I am mainly interested in UK Cheese though, to be more precise.<br /><br />Big up on getting your ducks in a row before selling herb on SR..&nbsp; I think alot of new vendors severely underestimate the demand for commonly used drugs ie: cannabis, mdma, coke, dope, etc. <br /><br /><br />What would be really cool, is a Tizer and Walkers crisp UK to Worldwide vendor.&nbsp; Love me some Tizer.<br /><br /><br />

				Hi MC Haberdasher<br /><br />Thanks for response! I&#039;m not saying I would never ship to the US, but at the same time, I want to make sure I have the whole logistics of the operation perfect so I don&#039;t disappoint any of my&nbsp; domestic customers, before committing to shipping outside of the UK. Bottom line, I&#039;m going to get the domestic orders running smoothly before expanding internationally.<br /><br />I&#039;m not planning on growing UK Cheese. I&#039;ve seen vendors on SR selling it previously, I want to introduce new strains to the road. Something a bit different to the norm. <br /><br />I know exactly what you&#039;re saying about the quality of street weed here in the UK. In fact, I have a friend living in a city waaaaaay up on the Northern part of this island. He was chatting to me the other day saying how he&#039;d used ~10 dealers since living there. Every time single time, his weed was either wet, uncured, seedy, stalky, underweight... take your pick. Poor quality. Even though he no longer lives anywhere near me, he still orders from me, and every single time, congratulates me on my produce.&nbsp; Why did he use other dealers if he orders my stuff? I can&#039;t grow it fast enough. Well, I couldn&#039;t grow it fast enough. However, after recent significant up-scaling, I&#039;m confident I&#039;ll have more than enough to never run out again.<br /><br />If you want me to send you a bottle of Tizer and a pack of Walkers man, let me know. I&#039;ll seriously send you a bottle if you want? :)

				Im starting to see a trend of a few new vendors from the UK and eastern Europe that seem to be more into the growing and curing and also competitive pricing. Its nice too see. I can see why some people are annoyed when stock runs low, but to get bud of this quality it takes time. Anything Ive bought on the street over here seems rushed and goes moldy after a week, im guessing this is due to bad curing?&nbsp; <br /><br />On another note, what are your plans for your trim? Thats another market I think is underexploited. Ive gotten some before and its great for making butter. I think home growers are the best option for this and if available people will buy it if its priced right. If a grower dosnt want to make something from it they may as well try getting a few extra coins from it!<br /><br />PS send kinder eggs to the US as well since they are illegal there!

Of course this could be one of many reasons for mold, but more often than not, it&#039;s poor drying/curing technique or improper storage.<br /><br />That&#039;s an excellent idea about the trimmings. I usually keep the trim and make my own personal hash.

				Hi and welcome, seems like your one of the good guys, time will tell though, sorry for the lack of faith its in my nature.<br /><br />Try and get some Lemon Haze for the summer coming up, if you could get your hands on premium hash too that would be good, maybe some creamy Blueberry and throw in clean pollen for good measure and you have a buyer :)<br /><br />All the best on here.

				Great to see another new vendor, and always nice to see that their page is being handled professionally also.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying out your bud when it is posted up at the end of April - though I&#039;m secretly hoping that you manage to have some listings up for at 4/20 at least ;) hehe.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing more from you CannaKingUK.

You know, I&#039;ve been hoping that I could have something up by 4/20. It&#039;d be the PERFECT day for a grand opening! It all depends on the bud. If I&#039;m happy with it, I&#039;ll definitely have some up. When I&#039;m closer to listing my first item, I&#039;ll post up here on my own thread (once I create one closer to the time) to let everyone know to expect it on the road. I&#039;m practically giving away the first 10 orders. I won&#039;t say any more than that for now, but needless to say, I&#039;m confident they&#039;ll fly out!

				Haha, well have no fear as I will be browsing your vendor page and keeping up to date with your strains - love the great strains that are being grown in the UK that I had only ever previously seen available internationally.<br /><br />Was wondering if you had a list of strains that you are growing/planning? And whether you will be selling edibles, concentrates, etc. along with the bud? :)<br /><br />Any information would be great, and looking forward to seeing your listings in April (glad to see you will place the bud above the 4/20 date, though I sure hope the bud is perfect for that date as it would be a great start date) :)<br /><br />Thanks again mate.

We&#039;ll be launching with THC Bomb, with a harvest of Big Bud from Sensi Seeds coming 70ish days later, followed by Motivation from Serious Seeds 35ish days after that. We&#039;ll be introducing a brand new strain every 35ish days from that point on. What would you like to see? Im pretty much geared for indica varieties, opposed to sativas (due to the lengthier flowering times of sativas). I&#039;m open to all suggestions. If there&#039;s something you&#039;ve always wanted to try, let me know and I can work it into the rotation. Bearing in mind each crop takes a touch over 16 weeks from seed, anything suggested now won&#039;t find its place in the rotation til the end of April, eventually appearing on the road mid-end of September.

A prime example of this happening is during the curing process if the curer fails to burp their storage jars sufficiently. Of course this could be one of many reasons for mold, but more often than not, it&#039;s poor drying/curing technique or improper storage.<br /><br />That&#039;s an excellent idea about the trimmings. I usually keep the trim and make my own personal hash. However with the amount I&#039;ll be growing over the next 12 months at least, I would likely have more trimmings than me and my associates can smoke! I&#039;ll have to see what happens. <br /><br />Kinder Eggs, Tizer, Walkers crisps... the shopping list to the US grows :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah Ive changed my own storage method as well, I have it in a grip seal baggy placed in plastic specimen jars that I get from work like this Clear net link!!&nbsp; http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/170/291/401/401291170_558.jpg&nbsp; or just google specimen sample bottle red cap. Yeah they are for piss and shit lol. But they seem to have a good seal on the lid. Would they maybe be best stored somewhere dark as well or at least out of direct light?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hmmm, in my experience, storing bud that&#039;s not completely dry in plastic causes it to sweat, raising the humidity of the container, and ultimately provides mold with a perfect environment to grow. I don&#039;t even like putting bud thats not dry into a baggy! Try using a small mason jar like these... http://www.jarstore.com/94-oz-Heremes-Clamp-Top-Lid-wMulti-Colored-Gaskets-_p_656.html<br /><br />My advice is to always keep your bud out of direct sunlight as sunlight causes degradation of THC. This is why bud is always dried in a completely dark environment.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				I think the main problem with weed on SR in the UK is that its really really expensive when compared to real world prices.&nbsp; Often you see stuff listed at £20+ per gram.<br /><br />It may well be decent stuff but TBH in the last 10 years the average standard of weed you get from random dealers is getting better and better.<br /><br />So its difficult to justify the high prices charged on SR when the average quality of weed in the UK is pretty good and its half the price of SR.<br /><br />When you look at the weed prices in other countries (even on SR) you start to see just how much more expensive it is in the UK.<br /><br />I think when people know that they are overpaying for a product, they become very unforgiving if and when something goes wrong.<br /><br />Personally Id rather be shot than pay some of the prices people offer stuff for on SR.<br />

He was explaining that the price of weed in the UK has risen from a very reasonable £120 a few years ago, to anywhere up to £200 (hell, I can sell on the oz for £230 where I am!) Now I&#039;ve been doing this for years and as such, have first hand experience of the rising cost of the electricity required to produce that bud. It&#039;s expensive. Especially when you&#039;re talking multiple environments running 24 hours a day, everyday. Having said that, I completely agree with you about the cost of quality bud on the road. £20+ per gram, rip off. I don&#039;t care how good your bud is. Now £10 a gram is a fair price for a fair weight these days. That&#039;s street price. A price I&#039;d happily pay. I know lots of people who regularly do. SR price has to be slightly inflated though. SR take their cut, P&amp;P costs, stealth, security. This all costs the vendor money. Now the way I see it, as long as I don&#039;t make less on the gram on here, than I would face to face, then I&#039;m happy to sell for very reasonable prices.<br /><br />People come to the road for many different reasons. Maybe they don&#039;t know anyone to supply them with what they want. Maybe they had a guy, but they had a falling out, now he&#039;s stuck without a dealer. Who knows? To some people, the very fact that they can buy their drugs anonymously is worth the inflated price. Vendors are probably aware of this fact and will charge more for the anonymity alone. <br /><br />I suppose the moral of the story is, if you think it&#039;s too expensive, find a cheaper vendor :)

They tend to be more available over the cooler months as lower night time temperatures can actually cause strains which aren&#039;t necessarily purple to get a purple shade to them. Its actually a slight magnesium deficiency caused by a big temperature variation between the lights on and lights off daily cycle... but yes, purple buds also exists regardless of temperature :) I&#039;m in no way slating other vendors strains, merely pointing out a fact.<br /><br />Yea cool. Hit me up when you&#039;ve had your first lot through!

				I&#039;ll be keeping my eye on your vendor account and this thread and i will certainly purchase an 8th when they&#039;re available. I noticed you said you&#039;ll only do 3.6g for now... Will you be upping the quantity at any point? I&#039;m only really interested in an ounce to be honest. Also what sort of prices are we looking at? Peace

Peace<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Talawtam<br /><br />We&#039;ll be starting off with a very special offer. Only 10 of this special offer will be available. These will serve as a &quot;paid for&quot; sample of our product. Once they&#039;ve gone out and buyers have received it and had a chance to leave feedback, we&#039;ll start making more quantities available. We won&#039;t be requiring any of our customers to FE (we&#039;ll only accept customers with 5+ transactions for now). We&#039;ve capped the weight at 3.6g to protect ourselves from packages not arriving. We will be offering a free reship for any customer whose lost a package, so long as they have more than 10 transactions. We believe this set up will be sufficient until we become better placed in the market. Once buyers have become regular customers, we can talk more about ounces.<br /><br />As for the prices, I have said a few times throughout various threads that I can beat 90% of the prices on the road at the moment, and still be comfortable with the margin. I don&#039;t want to get pinned down on any GBP values just yet, but it&#039;s safe to assume that if you see a price on the road at this point in time, I can beat it!<br /><br />

All of our bud is grown organically, no chemicals whatsoever. You&#039;ll be able to taste what I&#039;m saying is true when you try it :) I might be selling some hash. Once the perpetual is at full production, I&#039;ll have more trimmings than I&#039;ll know what to do with so selling hash would be the next logical step to take.&nbsp; Normally I just have enough for me and friends to smoke.<br /><br />I look forward to being your &quot;go to&quot; guy for top quality bud!<br /><br />CK
