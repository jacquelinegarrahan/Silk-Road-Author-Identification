				Hi everyone. I&#039;m new to SR. I&#039;ve place two orders so far. My second order was successful and as smooth as can be. But the first order I placed is problematic. I placed my order with a long time trusted vendor who does have a history of delays and long waits. The order was placed on the 12th. Sent the vendor a message on the 16th which he still has not read. My order was marked &#039;in transit&#039; on the 19th however, so I decided to sit tight and hope it showed up. The vendor updated his profile on the 21st stating a lot of orders had shipped and again on the 22nd stating he was overwhelmed with messages and asking for patience. Still no sign of my package on the 29th, 10 days after it had been shipped, so I have messaged the vendor again, and this message as well has not been read. The &quot;resolve&quot; function became available yesterday. My intention is to wait until the mail has been delivered today and see if it comes, and if not message the vendor again with &quot;important&quot; in the subject line as he instructed in this most recent update, and hold off on clicking &#039;resolve&#039; until 2 days before auto-finalize.<br /><br />Is this the right way to go about this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />T4B

				there is no right or wrong as long as you&#039;re not being a dick which it sounds like you&#039;re not. IMHO i think your approach is reasonable and fair. good luck i hope you can resolve this amicably thru the resolution centre. good luck my fellow SR traveler. may the force be with u and the LE be fucked off. take care.

I have no intention of shaming as his credentials are pretty well known in his reviews and elsewhere on this forum. Seems like he has pretty great product but big distribution issues. I read and should have known that going into the transaction, but he had recently (June 15th) posted on his profile that those issues had been remedied. <br />

				Purhaps you Christy or someone else could articulate what happens in the resolution process? After I click resolve what happens? <br /><br />I am not going to let it auto-finalize. I will click resolve before that time unless something miraculously arrives.

				Turkey for Breakfast,<br /><br />When you enter the resolve process you can enter a message and what you want, an extension on the finalization time or a % return of money.<br /><br />There are 4 days on the clock then, the vendor can respond and enter a message as well as counter offer. This goes back and forth tell you come to an agreement or in 4 days or so the SR admins step in. It should be noted that if you put it into resolution 1 hour before auto-finalization it will extend it by 4 days and will more than likely tick the vendor off. If you have ordered locally (For me US to US) you should have it IMO within 14 days of shipment. Most of my stuff is delivered in 4 days of shipment. So I would send the vendor a message at 14 days and let them know you did not get it. They can track it with the DCN. If he does not respond or give your any grief I would put it into resolution. But give him or her the opportunity to see what is up and correct the problem.<br /><br />Note, if the vendor has a DCN that shows he shipped it to you and it was returned to sender for any reason, held in customs, or it shows delivered then, it is my understanding that, SR with rule in the vendors favor and finalize the escrow. <br />Some vendors offer a % return in some of these situations, but that is up to them.<br /><br />Now you should also be aware that if you get a bitcoin return it will ding your stats and some vendors will not deal with you if your stats show significant refunds.<br /><br />It should be noted that I have only seen the vendor side of this so some of the above is speculation from what I have seen.

				@ Turkey<br /><br />HAHAHA i was reading you description and i was actually thinking dimitrispice.&nbsp; He is well known, has a great reputation but the slowest damn delivery time ever.&nbsp; But hands down, dimitri is the man... and i mean 2 weeks + slow sometimes.&nbsp; <br /><br />DiMiTriSpice was my 3rd purchase, and he will come through young grasshopper, he just takes a bit of time.&nbsp; My suggestion is to request another 2 weeks just to be on the safe side.&nbsp; I know this sounds kinda long but as someone once told me, sometimes it&#039;s not smart to rush DMT, let it come to you. <br /><br />On a side note, HAVE FUN... i myself am buying DMT hopefully soon.&nbsp; I have been using KidCasio and his delivery time is like 2 days domestic.&nbsp; Also his quality is quite out of this world... literally.<br /><br />I am however planning on buying from Moon Unit, as i have heard they have some quality goods and a speedy delivery time.<br /><br />Hope all the best friend!&nbsp; See u in hyperspace!

				Thank Jdawg and jl2 for the info! I will go ahead with what I have stated to him in my messages and keep my word, then begin resolution far better informed now. Ask for 2 more weeks and see if he can come through. Not really bitter, as I knew going into this transaction his shipping was an issue in the past, just disappointed because I was hopeful it had gotten fixed. <br /><br />Thanks again guys,<br />T4B

				Christy,<br /><br />I hadn&#039;t given much thought to my name when I created it. As of now I haven&#039;t given much thought to changing it either.<br /><br />While I am thinking about it, I&#039;ll keep you updated. I personally don&#039;t eat pizza for breakfast. But I also can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever eaten turkey for breakfast either. I think I was going for absurdity when I created it, but I can&#039;t recall for sure. <br /><br />I kind of like the idea of the uncommon Turkey for Breakfast and the images it creates for me creatively. Perhaps hunting the Turkey flock as they graze in the early daylight? Maybe I like the idea of ingesting some tryptophan in the early hours and fighting sleep the whole day. Akin to sniffing up some zanax and battling my eyelids until I collapse. More often I cook up some pork in the mornings and eat that with some eggs, toast, and orange juice. Pork being a land animal, not poultry, quite different from turkey. Although they are both white meat and neither can truly fly. So in many ways the same? <br /><br />I dunno, I don&#039;t feel like Pizza for Breakfast conjures any interesting thoughts or worthwhile dialogue. Whereas Turkey for Breakfast has managed to &#039;disturb&#039; you enough to ask me twice to change it. Sorry it troubles you and I hope you can come to terms with your feelings about it. I plan to keep it as it is.<br /><br />Love always,<br />T4B

				Yeah judging by all his listings being removed and all of his recent reviews stating no communication and no shipping I would think his business is offline.

				Hay Turkey, <br /><br />I cant really help with your dilemma as i am new to this myself and just getting my head around it all, but after reading your post and the replies it seems to me that you have been more than reasonable and fair with your actions to come to a resolution. I can only hope when I make my first order and if I trip over my own feet in the process the vendor is as understanding and patient with me as you have been with your seller. Good luck and keep us posted cos I&#039;m interested as this could help me in the future. <br /><br />P.s There an&#039;t nothing better than a Turkey sandwich for breakfast on boxing day.&nbsp; ;)

I plan to keep it as it is.<br /><br />Love always,<br />T4B<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />now u have done it!!!!<br /><br />the grazing turkey talk has only made hungry for pizza!! i haven&#039;t had a slice since last november!!!<br /><br />mmmmmm - pizza and a cold beer!!!<br />delivered to my door - god i love this country!!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are too fuckin&#039; funny!!! +1

Take a deep breath and relax... you&#039;re now in for the long haul but I wouldn&#039;t worry, it won&#039;t help!<br />In my opinion it will play out one of two ways:<br />1. Within the next 12 days Dimi will get off his ass and refund you your $ or ship your product.<br />2. SR will at the end of the 12 days see that Dimi has fucked off and refund you your $...<br /><br />FYI: I love sliced turkey on buttered bread for breakfast!!

				I noticed new listings from vendor today. Still no response to messages or resolution. Sent a new message about my order. I&#039;m hopeful he reads and replies.

				T4B--On occasion, when my first resolution proposal is being ignored, I have waited until close to the finalize date/time and submitted a stronger request.&nbsp; For instance, my first resolution offer was an extension; with no response I then asked for a 50% refund; and with still no answer I&#039;ll file another claim just before the deadline.&nbsp; Three out of three times vendor support has sided with me.&nbsp; So--as far as I know, you can change your resolution offer anytime.

				First of all Turkey, leave the name as is. It&#039;s different, creative and it&#039;s getting people to notice your name.<br /><br />Second personally I wouldn&#039;t have extended the resolution. It seems like that guy is blowing you off. I personally have a short fuse with shit like that and to me you&#039;ve waited long enough and have sent an ample amount of messages. I mean come on, he hasn&#039;t even read your messages. I have never had to go the resolution route so far and am not that informative about it but as soon as I could, I would not ask but demand a 100% refund. Don&#039;t let this deter you though from participating with any other vendors here cause there are great vendors out there. <br /><br />If you really want that product, I would not stress about your current situation cause it&#039;ll just cause you more frustration but at the same time stay on top of it. Look for another vendor or ask around for a vendor that is more responsive and better at business. Do research on him, deposit more money in your wallet if you need it and move on. Good luck with everything.

				Thanks Turq and Wolfe. I have a request in for 100% refund, but it looks like it wont be granted until the end of the 14 day extension (now 7 days away). I have looked into other vendors with the same product, but all are insistent on FE and I won&#039;t go that route either. <br /><br />As of last night the current vendor has my exact product back up and listed. Continued disappointment.

Another oft unappreciated advantage to Anonymity for many of today&#039;s Internet civilians.<br /><br />It&#039;s annoying, but your situation is actually fairly unique.
