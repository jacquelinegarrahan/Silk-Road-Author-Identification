				So i stumbled on the silk road one day, about a month ago, researching LSD.&nbsp; Aside from my dismay of never being able to find it where i live, including the fact that i had already given up on this search at my ripe old age of late 20&#039;s i actually surfed the net to figure out what&nbsp; happened to all the LSD?&nbsp; Sure enough i come across a post about some guy saying you would have better luck buying LSD online then on the streets.Personally i hadn&#039;t tried it and psychedelics have always been very mysterious to me.&nbsp; &nbsp; This enticed me and i of course learned everything i needed to learn to be talking with you all right now!<br /><br />Well lets just say when i found the SR i felt like i was on some sorta speed.&nbsp; I probably smoked a bowl here and there but legitimately i couldn&#039;t sleep the first 2-3 nights (minimal sleep more like it).&nbsp; All i wanted to do was research the forums and surf the silk road.&nbsp; Even now i am bored realizing my package wont be arriving today so i feel COMPELLED to spend time with my silk road brothers, share my experiences and read up on some of theirs. It seems however, the more i read the more Pandora&#039;s box seems to open.&nbsp; Personally i was quite content with an order of LSD, but wait!&nbsp; I guess i have always wanted to try PURE MDMA!&nbsp; Next thing i know i am just LOOKING at the fish scale cocaine and the butterflies start racing around in my stomach.<br /><br />Now i bet your all thinking I&#039;m going to take this anti SR twist here at the end, but not quite.&nbsp; I still stand neutral in all this because well quite frankly, this is ultimately pure freedom.&nbsp; The pure freedom to choose what you want to do with your bodies and what experiences YOU choose to have.&nbsp; ALTHOUGH with this site comes a great power, and with any great power comes great responsibility.&nbsp; Now, i have the ability to literally browse for the best drugs in my very own privacy.&nbsp; <br /><br />So what does this all mean?&nbsp; Well quite frankly it was harder for me to access drugs before but now i have an endless supply of options through complete anonymity.&nbsp; My options have been opened and my desire has been fueled by testimonies and pictures of mouth watering mind enhancing chemicals.&nbsp; I believe in time my GIANT BONER for this site will subside, but i was feeling compelled so i wanted to share my experiences thus far and see if anybody else has similar behaviors.<br /><br />PS.&nbsp; Seriously i felt like i took some sort of amphetamine the first night i discovered SR, is that a common experience or am i just a full blown addict =P<br /><br />my choice, my body, YOUR DRUGS!<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Hahaha! its alright brother, this site can be&nbsp; rather overwhelming! i was/am the same SR is pretty much always up on my second display.<br /><br />Love the forums here, you couldn&#039;t ask for a better community, this place has such a variety of people you can pretty much get a answer for anything :)<br /><br />This site is the best example for harm reduction i have ever seen. I hope it continues for along time to come!

				I felt the exact same way when i first found out about the dark net.<br /><br />After downloading tor I didn&#039;t even log on or start exploring for about a week. Instead I just kept steadily doing research on how it works and the ways of navigating it.<br /><br />After a matter of time I decided to actually take the plunge and joined SR as well as BMR. Two great places imo.<br /><br />I totally agree with this site comes ALOT of power and I don&#039;t even share the exact natures of my online dealings with my closest friends. At least for now or until the orders start coming in.<br /><br />Awesome to hear from another excited new member.

				Hahahaha!&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t agree more that SR is arguably more addictive than heroin.&nbsp; I *also* came here looking for Lucy, only to find not just real, legitimate Lucy, but 10 other real, legitimate substances I&#039;ve always wanted to try but never had the appropriate opportunity.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s true though, don&#039;t let your guard down--better to get into the habit of obfuscating your onion dealings than to forget, slip up, and get scammed, or worse, a knock at the door from LE.

				I came here for variety and I found it :)<br />What I love about this place is that most people on here are generally nice and funny but it&#039;s not so overwhelming that it&#039;s like it&#039;s too good to be true.<br />I can honestly say this IS the most addictive thing to me.

				Yeah but I love it though, like when I tried to pull the lesbian in the middle of a troll thread or talked about what I&#039;m making for dinner in USD-gate thread. Makes life interesting.<br /><br />Mister Dank, I&#039;m not paying your mum today by the way. She wasn&#039;t value for money and without bum fun I don&#039;t consider it good value for money I&#039;m afraid. I like to see a Dank-Brown-Mum-Nug on the bellend before I do a sex piss.
