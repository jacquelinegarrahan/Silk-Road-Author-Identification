Please bring back the spam busters, or make more mods capable of editing or deleting posts or banning users. This is retarded. The spam isn&#039;t financially based anymore. The spam is a forum attack method and a way to try to attack the bitcoin community. Silk Road is a constant battleground. How many scam/DDOS/hack/phishing attempts can you name that have occured in the last few months? <br /><br />The spam is not guided by financial gain in my opinion, it is a means of disruption.

				Everyone chill pill out for a bit ok, I just spoke with DPR and he seems to except the need to have a spam buster or two.<br />He asked my opinion as my choice and of course I gave t back to mohska.<br />I dont make the decisions so dont bother even posting anything relating to becoming anything else than what you currently are here, just be grateful someone with experience might be back on top of things. This is a good thing, it&#039;s the first step back to moving forward than backwards.<br />So just give it a few days and see if anything happens, I kinda suggested many thinks but we will see if 1 or any of them happen either way we all need to be on the look out for each out and vigilant. Never become comfortable here that always ends in &quot;Where are my BTCS ...&quot;When Will SR be giving my BTCs back&quot;? For those that don&#039;t know the answer to those two questions is they wont&#039; be giving them back. SO you look out for you and your mates and call out the cheats when you see them...if it seems to good to be true make them prove it&#039;s not and for god&#039;s sake stop finalizing early for whatever stupid reason the vendor gives you.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad
