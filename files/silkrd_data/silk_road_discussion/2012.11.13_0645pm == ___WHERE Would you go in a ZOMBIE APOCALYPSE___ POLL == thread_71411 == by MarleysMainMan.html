				Hey guys and gals, just wanted to start a poll/topic that will hopefully take our minds off the stress with SR being down... <br /><br />With that said I would personally go to Homedepot, my defense being that they have the largest and most dynamic&nbsp; building supplies to offer along with tools. Sure, no guns or food like the Walmart guys down the street, but I feel after we have securely barricaded our group in there using the various tools and materials at our disposal, Walmart and the other places would have no choice but turn to us for supplies to fortify their store too! Thus beginning the trade guns/food for tools/building supplies. Ultimately I think Homedepot would survive the longest assuming they initiated trade with another store.&nbsp; And I would pick a truck rental equipped store as well, tractors and flatbeds are perfect for zombies...lol<br /><br />What do you guys think.. and don&#039;t just vote, give a reason why you chose your option!<br /><br />Good news is we will be giving out 4 free grams to 4 people with the funniest/most serious explanations...as soon as SR&#039;s up of course...<br /><br />MMM

				None of the above.<br /><br />I had this discussion with a friend the other day when we were tripping. &quot;Oh dude, a zombie apocalypse would be the shit; lots of energy, something to do, etc.&quot; Of course it wouldn&#039;t be fun. It&#039;d be serious fucking business.<br /><br />The first thing you&#039;d have to do is watch all (four?) seasons of The Walking Dead. Not even a question. Needs to be done.<br /><br />Next you&#039;d want to set up a secure perimeter; big, suburban houses would work well, but personally I&#039;d go to a mall. Malls have not only locks on the outer doors to secure said perimeter, but also gates on every individual store so that if shit gets really rough, you can always just hole up in any store of your choosing. Not only that, but you&#039;ve got a whole fucking food court and a shitload of cell phones for the taking. Makes it easy to regroup and feed everyone you&#039;re with.<br /><br />Of course, they don&#039;t sell guns/ammunition in most malls, but guns could attract zombies anyway. Last thing you want is more zombies. You&#039;d probably want to snag some sort of sharp object (knife, pole, etc.) or some other noiseless weapon to kill those fuckers before you get a gun from somewhere (likely a Wal-Mart or a gun store if there is one nearby). First thing that comes to mind for me is a big ass stick, or those weird stakes with flags on top that they use in construction areas. My town has a bunch of construction going on, so getting one of those should be fairly easy. After you&#039;ve got a melee weapon, just go grab a gun or a crossbow or something in case shit gets real nasty.<br /><br />Then, like I said, straight to the mall, man. Rob Sears of anything useful -- tools, all that junk. Make sure you and your buddies know how to use the shit in the food courts. I recommend using the Internet while it still works to print out any useful information -- how to hotwire cars, that sort of shit. Then, you basically just live. If you need to leave, grab what you need and use the information you printed out to hotwire a car, for instance; preferably a truck or some other big rig they have outside in the parking lot. Secure that bitch, load it up with emergency shit even before you need to leave (in case you really have to duck out), and then just chill.<br /><br />Really pretty simple when you think about it. Granted, drugs would be slim, but you&#039;d be alive.

				1. Gun store<br />2. Hardware store<br />3. Supermarket with items from 1 and 2<br />4. Home<br /><br />Since there will be a zombie apocalypse, this applies equally well to the civil war brewing in the US.

				First stop for me is raid the pharmacies, and stock up on cigarettes and liquor. Overlooked items that are great for bartering.<br /><br /><br /><br />So if the coming catastrophic apocalypse comes and you find yourself drugless because you stocked up on silly things like guns and food, holler at your girl. ;) I&#039;m too weak for combat but when it comes to vice I am a fucking warrior.<br /><br />After that... hmm... I guess I&#039;d be pretty nomadic and try to stay in remote places. I already rape homeless men on a nightly basis, so I am more than prepared for that kind of life.

				emmmm...<br /><br />1st things 1st, it would definately have to be amsterdams, red light district, to get me some zombie pussy...! <br /><br />then its rampage time across europe, starting in france, not to kill zombies but to give them a hand to take out the french lol then its onwards and upwards to switzerland to take a few zombies out with an overdose of chocolate, or to beat them to death with some percision cookoo clocks...<br /><br />when my killing spree across europe is coming close to a end, germany would be my last port of call and i would go &quot;call of duty&quot; crazy on their hairy zombie asses, if im not already wiped out by some zombie man-eating fanny in the dam, french arrogance or a zombie cookoo bird...

				Definitely the first thing I would do is get the gang together. I relay on Big Bird especially: he lives in a large nest behind the 123 Sesame Street brownstone. Once we&#039;re there I&#039;m afraid I have to sacrifice my huge cookie stock so that we can deploy them as special weapons - they strike really hard - and seriously, my friend Elmo has the greatest throwing technique you could ever imagine.. Only problem is that once we ran out of cookies I don&#039;t have a plan B.. <br /><br />Sorry guys but in case this zombi invasion is really about to happen I fear that unfortunately this will means the downfall of Big Birt, Elmo, the rest of the gang and myself and Sesame Street will be gone forever - never to be seen on television again - a catastrophic disaster.

				What with SR going black and DPR knocking old ladies down and stealing their wallets after kicking them in the ribs, how do you expect me to contemplate something as serious as the zombie apocalypse?? <br /><br />Although ... now that I am thinking about it (and gauging from folk&#039;s reactions) I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if SR going down completely is what will CAUSE the zombie apocalypse.

				I voted Walmart, and here&#039;s why:<br /><br />First of all, I don&#039;t think that too many post-apocalyptic Walmart inhabitants would be too eager to make a mad dash for their vehicle with a 150lb shopping cart that&#039;s full of things to barter with. To supplement this assumption, I introduce into evidence the fact that Walmart sells hunting rifles, shotguns, and ammunition to boot. They also have a pretty well-stocked &quot;Tools&quot; section. The only thing that they truly lack that Home Depot has plenty of is actual building material (such as planks of lumber, steel beams, rebar, etc.). However, if *I* were in a post-apocalyptic scenario, I&#039;d be making due with what I had at my disposal. One thing that Walmart has plenty of is things that could be used as walls. I&#039;m not talking about pegboard/slatwall. There are literally *hundreds* of metal shelving units and the like just sitting around inside the store. Pop a few screws out of each shelving unit, and you have a bunch of sheet metal that you can reassemble to make giant walls of impenetrable metal. Head on back to the &quot;Tools&quot; section and grab the tools needed to secure said metal walls to the entrances/exits, leaving *one* entrance/exit only temporarily sealed so that the living can come and go as they please.<br /><br />Even better, one could grab a Dremmel (rotary tool) and the metal cutting disc attachment from the &quot;Tools&quot; department and saw off sections of shopping carts. Then, using said shopping cart sections in conjunction with carabiners (or those U-shaped nut-and-bolt things), you could make cage-like walls for the entrances/exits. Then, grab yourself a nice, solid broomstick, some duct tape, and a nice solid knife (my recommendation: the Bear Grylls survival knife) and make a nice, sturdy spear. Head on up to the cage-like walls and start poking zombie foreheads through the openings every now and then to reduce the risk of being attacked should you need to make a trip outside for anything, or to make it easier for others to get in without having to fight off the zombie horde that would otherwise be waiting in the parking lot to gaffle you up.<br /><br />Once the walls are secure, you have a whole Walmart inventory of delicacies at your disposal. My recommendation for the celebratory snack: pumpkin roll (the kind with real cream cheese filling, not cream cheese flavored icing filling).<br /><br />After the celebratory snack, it&#039;s time to consider time-killers (other than &quot;poke the rotting forehead&quot;). Hit up the toy isle. It&#039;s time to bring out that inner child. Can you say &quot;Connect Four&quot;? Ahh yeeeaah. But first, the most important part - the pharmacy :D There are plenty of roxys and insulin syringes to be had, so it&#039;s time to get a little crazy! Even if you overdose, you can die happily knowing that when that supply of meds runs out, there&#039;s no reason to live anymore anyways!<br /><br />After some fun &amp; games, it&#039;s time to make the place look like a home. There&#039;s a ton of brand-new furniture all boxed up, waiting to be taken advantage of. Clear out a section of the store and set up a few brand new futons, a brand new coffee table, a brand new area rug and matching runners, a brand new bed with a brand new nightstand beside it - brand new mattress/sheets/comforter/pillows (all top-of-the-line, of course), a brand-new fully loaded Mossberg to curl up with at night. Maybe set up one of those badass TV stands that&#039;s meant for flat-screens.&nbsp; If there&#039;s still electricity, set up the biggest TV that they have (I believe 72&quot; is the largest at my Walmart), hook a brand new xbox up and throw in &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; to get a feel for your new lifestyle. If you&#039;re not a big gamer, grab a blu-ray player from Electronics and pop in the blu-ray version of 28 Days Later to get said feel for your new lifestyle. If there&#039;s no electricity, a nice big painting will do. If they don&#039;t have any paintings to your liking, grab some posterboard from Crafts and paint a lovely portrait of yourself gouging the eyes out of a rotting undead zombie&#039;s skull (the key is light brush strokes).<br /><br />When the boredom starts to kick in, it&#039;s time to try to draw attention from other survivors - possibly even the rescue squadrons. Find yourself a way up to the roof and take a few dozen cans of paint up there to write &quot;SOS - ALIVE INSIDE&quot; as big as possible. Then, just sit back, relax, and wait for the cavalry to arrive.

				None of your options. My 1st choice after getting weapons is securing a shopping centre, or a mall for those across the pond. Next would be an abandon prison, yes I have been watching The Walking Dead.
