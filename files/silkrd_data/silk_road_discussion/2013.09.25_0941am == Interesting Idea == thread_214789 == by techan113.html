				Buyers have stats that Vendors can look up, such as total spent, refund rate, auto finalization rate, etc... <br /><br />Sellers have stats that Buyers can look up, such as total transactions, feed back, rating, rank, etc...<br /><br />Now my idea, is to make visible to Buyers, Sellers current amount of Open Resolution Center Claims. This would help prospective Buyer&#039;s protect against rogue vendors who are starting to scam/ selectively scam.<br />&nbsp;<br />Vendors with a higher incidence rate would be labeled as riskier, and be rated accordingly. Once the Resolution Center has arrived to a resolution, the vendors rating would improve. Additionally, more recent Claims could be weighted more heavily, as well as, larger Bitcoin amount transactions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Transparency of non identifying metrics like the aforementioned could potentially decrease the problem with rogue vendors that decided to selectively scam. By revealing a trend early on, and better informing Buyers.<br /><br />It is possible that behind the scenes this is already a system in place, but what are the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of making it visible to all members...Especially Buyers!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Please only serious replies, but I welcome criticism. :)

				Bad idea for what it intends to accomplish. Resolutions is designed to prevent scamming. The only orders that are eligible for resolutions are those transacted in escrow. <br /><br />There are many reasons why orders end up in resolutions. From mutually agreed direction to enter resolution to buy more time, to buyers being overly picky over small things. What lies in between these issues does not amount to &quot;risk.&quot; <br /><br />Selective scamming is difficult to deduce. There really is no metric one can reliably use to gauge selective scamming. <br /><br />If there&#039;s any change that&#039;s needed in resolutions is that if SR has to arbitrate the issue, both parties should be disallowed to leave feedback on the transaction. Obviously the losing buyer will leave negative feedback. And when ratings fro buyers is implemented, it would be obvious that a losing vendor will leave negative feedback for the buyer.

				I see what you&#039;re saying but I think this issue is seen from the wrong angle as this information can already be seen by Silk Road Support, and they&#039;re acting on it in every case. The problem boils down to the Finalize Early Concept and on how it currently works. The problem is Finalize Early is not a Concept Silk Road had in mind when they created the site, it&#039;s a behavior some Vendors are forced to use since Silk Road hasn&#039;t implemented a proper solution for this problem. The fact Silk Road even has rules for &quot;Finalize Early&quot; is quite absurd/tragic in a sense, they even acknowledge people are using the system in a way it was not meant to be used but they do nothing about it. So here&#039;s the thing:<br /><br />Silk Road must embrace the concept of Finalize Early by properly integrating it into the System. This means Vendors should have the option to require Buyers to Finalize Early instantly yet still accept the orders without having to put them in transit first. Buyers would still get to rate the Vendor/Transaction but they would have no recourse for getting their money back, even if they got scammed. If enough buyers would mark the Vendor as a scam, then and only then would it be appropriate with a warning - maybe even a warning sign which gets bigger with each Buyer reporting it as a scam. Eventually the &quot;Warning Sign&quot; could get so big you could hardly read what&#039;s on the page, and this would be a sign for Silk Road Support to get involved a lot earlier. This would as I said though only work if they embrace the Concept and properly integrate it into the System. I&#039;m not holding my breath for that unfortunately but there&#039;s plenty that can be done on this issue, and I would say your idea is also better than the current one which is basically nothing at all.

				First off thanks for all the feed back, that&#039;s why I love this community.<br /><br />To address a few things said...<br /><br />Creating an extension system that is separate from the resolution center, so that international vendors don&#039;t<br />get bad reps for their orders taking longer than the 17 days allotted.&nbsp; <br /><br />FE is a big issue here on the road, especially since as far as I have seen there is not much recourse for buyers.<br />A possible solution could be that funds are released to the vender but are not allowed to be spent/withdrawn until the buyer updates that the transaction has completed or a specific amount of time. This isn&#039;t ideal but just a thought.<br /><br />Lets keep this thread going everybody!!!

				Idea itself. But i believe it would be detrimental to SR itself. Not every vendor is as perfect as what they state, The volume of sales naturally bring up resolutions, and at the same time there are ssamming buyers looking for a freebie. So resolutions will always be there. If a buyer were to see them all they would do is scare away a sale from a maybe good vendor?

				I think as long as people recognise there are legit reasons for being in resolution (international orders) this could work.<br />I have never been to resolution but if they ask the reasons, for e.g. not recieved yet, not recied after 50 days, not advertised product, underweight it could give buyers good stats, esp if they show how it changed over time. Could see failed packages spiking, could imply LE are onto stealth of that vendor and you would be able to see it improve when products start arriving.<br /><br />Also this would be wighted by overall volumes.<br /><br />+1 to OP<br /><br />Although this could be abused to, if someone gets product but sees everyone else didnt, they may jump on the bandwagon and claim they never got it.<br />But this wouldn&#039;t be that much different to vendors selectively scamming.

				Also I believe this kind of system, could possibly decrease total disputes, as well as decrease total time spent in the resolution center. This does put a heavier burden on vendors and may not be ideal but its worth a thought.

				I am a vendor, but I am on the verge in this particular idea.<br /><br />Since, I will ship everywhere even Australia,E.eu and transaction auto finalize after 17 days, I will get a LOT more resolution center (to extand) .<br /><br />However, I think the most important aspect of SR is buyer protection since they lay the cash and give their address and such.. they can be @ the mercy of a selective scammer.<br /><br />Interesting idea to say the least +1 and subbed !
