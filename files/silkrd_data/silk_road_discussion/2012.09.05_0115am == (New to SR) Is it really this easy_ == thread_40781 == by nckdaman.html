				I know you all probably get sick of these kinds of posts but id feel much safer if i could have someone tell me that im doing everything right. So i will be purchasing a money pak in exchange for bitcoins. Then those bitcoins should (hopefully) be in my SR account. Now i will purchase my item and send it to an abandoned house with a fake name. I understand there&#039;s some controversy over how safe this is but in my situation it is the safest. Am i missing any steps or is it that easy?

				To answer your question, yes it is very easy. <br /><br />But Moneypak is a horrible way of getting bitcoins, it&#039;s essentially the same thing as finalizing early, only it&#039;s even worse because you can&#039;t even leave bad feedback when they decide to fuck you. If you are in the US, use Bitinstant.<br /><br /><br />Sending drugs to an abandoned house with a fake name is just asking to get arrested. Don&#039;t you think it will raise suspicion when there is suddenly mail being delivered to a vacant house that hasn&#039;t received any in who knows how long? What exactly is your game plan when someone starts asking questions? You have absolutely no chance for plausible deniability if you are running up to a house you don&#039;t own and picking up mail that obviously doesn&#039;t belong to you. <br /><br />You should really think this through more. I know this all seems like a joke because it&#039;s the Internet but you are messing with felony charges here. People have their lives ruined every day for doing what you are about to do. I can venture a few guesses as to why you don&#039;t want these packages sent to your own residence, and all I can say to you is that even if Silkroad specifically is taken down some day, the online drug scene is here to stay. If you can&#039;t do this safely now, just wait until you can.

				Hi,<br /><br />Using a fake name AND using an abandoned house is really not recommended.&nbsp; First the vendor is not going to give you any refund whatsoever if the package is doesn&#039;t arrive or is lost.<br /><br />Secondly you are greatly increasing the chances that your package will be in fact never arrive.&nbsp; You also increase your risk if you actually get caught picking up the package.&nbsp; You will have no reasonable way of denying that the package isn&#039;t yours.<br /><br />If the package comes to your house you can always claim you have no idea who sent it and deny it is yours.<br /><br />The most common method of ordering is to make a small change to your name, such as &#039;Franc Smith&#039; instead of Frank Smith.&nbsp; Just enough to make it believable someone sent it to you by mistake.<br /><br />I am sure if you were to ask around that probably 90% of people ordering either use a safe house (a friend who is completely clean who is willing to take delivery and just hold it.&nbsp; If they come to his place and it&#039;s not open he can just honestly claim he figured it was delivered to the wrong address.&nbsp; Or, they have it delivered to their own address with a small change in the name (some buyers will use the name of a previous tenant - someone whom they still get occasional junk mail and the like for and simply throw away).<br /><br />Make sure you read the profile of the vendor you plan to order from and make note of ALL the conditions.&nbsp; You will find many state outright that if you use a fake name they will not offer any refunds.<br /><br />Nobody is going to stop you from using an abandoned house or fake name for the order, but honestly, the chances of having something go wrong if you order it to your own address are pretty small and if something does go wrong, the most likely scenario is you will just lose the package, it&#039;s unlikely that anyone is going to come banging on your door with a warrant unless you try ordering pounds of weed through the mail.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made over 40 orders and never had a problem, only losing a couple of orders from eastern Europe.

				I would like to take this opportunity to talk about shipping to a vacant house.<br /><br />DONT!!!!<br /><br />Shipping to a vacant house is not a new idea! Back in the 1980&#039;s and 1990&#039;s people used vacant houses as drop locations for shit that was bought on a stolen credit cards. It was wide spread enough that the post office as well as UPS/FedEx/DHL/Etc.. all watch for this type stuff. <br /><br />A package showing up to a vacant house is a dead giveaway something is up. Neighbors tend to now what houses are vacant and do notice people walking up to check the mail. This is VERY BAD in a Ghost busters since of crossing the streams. <br /><br />Get a PO Box, get an apartment, have it sent to your house, have it sent to a friend, or have it sent to grandma for all I care, but I would stay away from a vacant house!<br /><br />

				I have been on here for over 6 months now and it is great.&nbsp; I have used the MoneyPak route so far for my coins.&nbsp; Sugar Mama is a legit vendor who will give you coins for your MP.&nbsp; I have heard about BitInstant, but haven&#039;t done my research yet.&nbsp; So if you want to get coins quick and safe use SugarMama.&nbsp; Read her review thread to make yourself feel better.<br /><br />As far as the fake name and address to an abandoned house i totally agree with the post above mine.&nbsp; VERY BAD IDEA.&nbsp; Real names and legit addresses are going to work much better.&nbsp; If you&#039;re at home with your parents you may need to reconsider.&nbsp; If you&#039;re an adult then you can figure something out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good Luck!&nbsp;

				Bitinstant to your wallet or sr wallet or tumbler your choice then use your name and your address this is what I do I get orders all the time no issues. The more you act odd or paranoid the greater your chances of getting caught use good opsec yet act casual.

				Just make sure you don&#039;t get fucked using MoneyPak trying to get coins.&nbsp; Patience is key if you take this route, the vendors with great feedback are obviously in demand.&nbsp; Just give them (i.e. Sug Mama) a few days to get your coins instead of getting impatient and running off to some sketchy coin vendor.&nbsp; PGP is great and there are several tutorials throughout the forum and on the regular interwebz.&nbsp; I&#039;d also suggest using seasoned vendors and buy domestically until you know what you&#039;re doing. :)<br /><br />Best of luck -- remember patience is key! You&#039;re not walking around the corner to purchase these fine products. Will take a little time.

				it amazes me that people still consider using fake name/abandoned house. <br /><br />postmen aren&#039;t stupid. they work the same route every day and suddenly a new, strange package arrives for an obviously abandoned house that hasn&#039;t been used in months? big red flag. <br /><br />if you can&#039;t use your address, find a friend, or just wait till you can. <br /><br />be safe, be secure
