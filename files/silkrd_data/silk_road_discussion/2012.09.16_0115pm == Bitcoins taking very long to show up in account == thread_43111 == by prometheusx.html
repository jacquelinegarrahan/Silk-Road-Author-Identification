				The second time I use the site. First time everything went smooth, no complaints. <br /><br />But now it&#039;s around 20 hours since I transferred my coins from a third party, nothing&#039;s shown up here. The guide says this should take up to 6 hours. Is this a &quot;normal&quot; glitch or did somebody just fuck me?

				Yeah, checked it. Just copy pasted the one in the account. <br /><br />Did another small one 6 hours ago, that isn&#039;t in either. So how long does patient mean?

				Did you go ultra cheap on your transaction fee?&nbsp; Paying less than 0.0005 transaction fee will put your transaction of the bottom of the miner&#039;s queue for processing transaction blocks.&nbsp; I learned this the hard way while learning bitcoin transfers.&nbsp; It will eventually show up, but my experience was 24 hours or more.<br /><br />Summary:&nbsp; Pay the penny or so to the miners.&nbsp; They are the reason bitcoins work.

Gox is 1-3 hours, 3 hours being unusually long. The fact that you think someone screwed you over suggests that you had your money in a less-than-legit place. I&#039;d wait a few hours longer and contact the person/site where the bitcoins are coming from. There should be some way to track the transfer and be able to check the address (to make sure you got it right). Good luck.

				I got the site from the buyers guide, Virvox. Had no problems the first time.<br /><br />What do you mean transaction fee? I just transferred the money, bought linden dollars, then bitcoins, then transferred that amount to here.

Gox market price (plus the fees of course) on a very timely basis (literally instantly). That being said bitcoin transfers to SR seems to be unusually slow today at least, sent some coins from my personal wallet hours ago with a 0.0005 fee and they have yet to appear in my account.

				well according to blockchain, bitinstant couldn&#039;t be bothered to pay the .001 fee. thanks guys. in the meantime the product i wanted sold out!<br /><br />also of note, in the confirmation email bitinstant sent they quote the BTC on the way, and on blockchain i have a full 0.5 less actually coming to me. so either there&#039;s another weird piece missing that is delaying the transfer (? doubtful) or they decided to nickel and dime me there too. in addition to the 3.99% (actually over 5% when counting the ZipZap fee) shady business. <br /><br />i *was* using bitfloor but then that went under. an honest and safe way to buy bitcoins is hard to find apparently.

You did things strangely...you use ZipZap then converted to linden dollars, then to bitcoin? Next time when you use bitinstant (which you should, they&#039;re one of the best sites for getting bitcoins), opt for a cash deposit (ZipZap) which is then moved over to Mt. Gox (still in USD). There should be NO fees moving from bitinstant to Mt. Gox, you&#039;re just moving USD from one place to another. Then, buy your bitcoins at Mt. Gox and move them &quot;elsewhere&quot;

				I guess i&#039;m confused, but why even bother with Mt. Gox?&nbsp; I had my bitinstant sent directly to my bitcoin wallet.&nbsp; Why involve Mt Gox at all?

				Got this reply from support:<br /><br />&quot;&quot;If this is your own address, i.e. of your own client, then probably that client has not read enough blocks yet to show the correct balance. You need to keep it running connected to the bitcoins network until it has read all the blocks.&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Run what? I have no clue what this means.

				i finally got my BTC from bitinstant (direct to an address), took about 18 hours. <br /><br />also the right amount came. strangely on blockchain it showed a full 0.5 less, but it changed to the correct amount as the block was picked up. strangely this happened almost immediately after i finally caved and emailed support. <br /><br />there was no fee attached to the transfer, so that&#039;s probably why it took so long. support mentioned they just send through MTGox so that aspect was out of their hands. they&#039;ll &quot;investigate changing that policy&quot; though.
