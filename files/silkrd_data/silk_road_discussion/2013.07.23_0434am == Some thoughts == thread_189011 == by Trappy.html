				We, the TOR community, actually have some structure for the first time, ever. Dread Pirate Roberts has established the first real institution of the darknet. This is the rock from which the entire TOR network hinges upon. When you choose to abide by escrow and the resolution center, you have abided by the authority of this institution and its structures.<br /><br />We do not rely on a government for structure. We have all chosen to set up shop or purchase from here, to pay the silk road fee and the hedging fee. This funds the resolution center which protects the transactions which fund it. <br /><br />You do not have to participate in the structure that is the escrow and resolution center if you do not choose to. This is an option, and the more options we the people have, the better. Vendors are each options that you are never forced upon, just as you yourself cannot force a vendor to sell to you.<br /><br /><br />Theres a new kid on the block, with flashy new clothes and she&#039;ll let you in cheap, but you&#039;re forgetting the other girl that we never liked. Kinda weird and she used to scam people from time to time, but she exists, and offers escrow.<br /><br />Black Market Reloaded.<br /><br />We only seem to recall the echos of old, when it was a more rife den of scammers, but now is not then. Their Administrator, Backopy (and yes, they do have a forums) has been acknowledged by our Administrator.<br /><br /><br />Until told otherwise, I say that his acknowledgement is the gift of legitimacy. Which ATL has not received (not the city, I&#039;m sure its pleasant this time of year). <br /><br /><br />The risk to work with illegitimate markets THAT DO NOT TUMBLE YOUR COINS FOR YOU, not only exceeds the amount of risk any of us should take, but is not as economically sound as working exclusively on the silk road! Can you find a bitcoin tumbling service that when combind with another market&#039;s fee, will not exceed the current fees of the silk road?<br /><br />4% for orders above $1000. <br /><br />Or do you feel comfortable with the blockchain providing LE with every transaction you have made?

				My feelings exactly, feel much more comfortable with BMR than ATl.<br />Also don&#039;t really like how ATl is so pushy and flashy, with all of thier marketing <br />and commercials, etc. for me just has a bad vibe surrounding it. If SR was down I would <br />rather shop BMR any day. IMHO

				Ive used BMR and ATL before.<br /><br />Received 3/3 orders from BMR and 0/1 from ATL.<br /><br />I like how Atlantis is usuing other crypto currencies though. That is one of SR&#039;s biggest weaknesses as far as im concerned. <br /><br />

They&#039;re new, they should have focused on bringing new people into the TOR community from the clearnet, rather than poaching silk roaders. There is still a tremendously uninformed population that could easily acquire the capability to use the TOR browser bundle and a hidden service, but they are untapped because nobody wants to reach out to them.

				Atlantis is one of the worst things to happen to the darknet in a while IMHO. Not a big fan. They popped up at a very suspicious time. They put up youtube advertisements. I highly doubt any founding member of Atlantis would ever put up a manifesto as DPR has entailing his true intentions behind the movement we are all a part of. Fuck Atlantis.

				I&#039;m excited about Onion Bank, which allows you to integrate payments into any (hidden service) web site. It gives merchants the opportunity to be independent of the walled gardens of the existing markets, and for only a 2.5% escrow fee, although the real value of the markets is exposure to buyers. Still, I think it could lead to a lot of innovation in onionspace.<br />

So far we&#039;ve noticed this on the Label 400 books and the APC generated tracking numbers. Regardless, I think this is a wonderful idea. It would make the checking of tracking numbers over TOR much more innocent.<br /><br />We&#039;ve already made use of this technique when we lost a good half of our tracking numbers at one point, just going down and trying the numbers in sequence, knowing the following x number of tracking labels ran in sequence and thus were ours&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

And I ran across a thread about Zerocoin and how it was going to reshape the future of BTC, making it even more anonymous and less trackable and shit like that. For all I know, it could be just a huge coding scheme to actually track every transaction made for LE database. But, who knows. I like to remain cautious, but not paranoid.
