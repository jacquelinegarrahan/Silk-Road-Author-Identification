				We all know what happened and I&#039;m not saying we shouldn&#039;t believe it. I&#039;m just asking this: does anyone have a proper source?<br /><br />I don&#039;t trust newspapers/websites/etc. It&#039;s too easy to feed them false information, and once published, they all copy each other. Any of the following would be sufficient for me:<br /><br />* A news message on a .gov website. (while it could be hacked, it would quickly disappear if that were the case) There is nothing to be found on the DEA and FBI websites. You&#039;d think even with the shutdown, something this big would at least deserve a note.<br />* Someone who currently works for LE who announces this on television or even radio (have only seen some ex-fed). While fakeable, I suppose nobody is going to show their face on TV and face the charges of impersonating LE.<br />* Photo or preferably video of Ross Ulbrichts in cuffs/jumpsuit/surrounded by cops. (fakeable, but hard)<br /><br />I know it&#039;s all over the news, but so are many lies. I know there&#039;s a 39-page report, but if I was going to stage my arrest, I&#039;d surely write something like that. This report is also not posted on any official website anywhere. (at least none that I could find)<br /><br />I want to be able to confirm this for myself.

				Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve found.. Some drawings from the court case and Brandon Leblanc is really real. Found him on some reunion photograph of a university he went to, the photograph hosted on the university website. So Leblanc doesn&#039;t appear to be made up or anything, he&#039;s really an attorney.<br /><br />Still.. I suppose 80 million dollars will buy you some nice drawings to feed to the media, bribe some journalist, and an attorney who tells the media whatever story you want them to hear. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s what happened. I&#039;m just saying I still can&#039;t find a proper source to definitively prove this isn&#039;t the hoax of the century.<br /><br />It may just be due to the government shutdown.<br /><br />Maybe some interviewed bystanders who witnessed Ulbricht being arrested, maybe on local television? If anyone knows of that, please post a link. (would be hard to fake since a web of lies will unravel if it gets too big, also, many people really suck at lying)

Yet two days later, they did post an artical titled &quot;Alleged al-Qaeda member extradited to U.S. to face terrorism charges.&quot;.<br /><br />They also posted a podcast about &quot;National Cyber Security Awareness Month&quot;. Yet not even a tweet about Silk Road? But maybe these two articles were already written before the shutdown and merely published.<br /><br />Guess I&#039;ll have to wait for the government reboot to be able to confirm this story.
