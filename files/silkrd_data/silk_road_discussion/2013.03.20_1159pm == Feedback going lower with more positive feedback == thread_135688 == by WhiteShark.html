				So for some reason, despite getting all 5/5 feedback, my percentage has gone down from 97.1% to 96%.<br /><br />I checked all my past feedback, none has changed. Just still the one 1/5 (zealous seller I am sure, finalized and left bad feedback before delivery, and said he was going to call the cops on me -- showed SR and they said they only remove if it reveals stealth) and a 4/5 given because a buyer, despite being warned that the bud could crush in transit, did not appreciate that the bud crushed in transit (1 gram order). <br /><br />I know the SR feedback system is complicated, however it can&#039;t possibly result in a lower rating when given 5/5 feedback can it?<br /><br />Can anyone weigh in? Thanks, much appreciated.

				Sorry mate not really sure what you mean..are you asking if my feedback affects my sales? <br />I would think so, when I was a buyer I would always try and get the 100% feedback guys<br /><br />Little did I know that having 88/90 transactions 5/5 and 1/90 at 4/5 and 1/90 at 1/5 would get me a 96% rating =/

				I wouldn&#039;t bother, quite frankly.&nbsp; Sure, go ahead if you really want to, but you know how swamped they always are and I doubt they can personally do much of anything about it.&nbsp; And you know how rare it is for a change that isn&#039;t directly related to profit these days.<br /><br />So the algorithm is obviously... not, very, accurate.&nbsp; What else is new ::) <br /><br />It may also be that whoever left you poor feedback purchased a large quantity recently, and when your score was recalculated at the time of your 5/5 purchase the low feedback was given more weight than before because the guy&#039;s total spent went up.&nbsp; Just conjecture, but you see my point.
