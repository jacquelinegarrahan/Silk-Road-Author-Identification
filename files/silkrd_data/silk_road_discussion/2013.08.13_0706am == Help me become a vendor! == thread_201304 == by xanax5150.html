				I will make it worth your while to help me out. I have a pill press,die/mold,20 grams of Alprazolam powder and 6000 Xanax bars ready to ship. I spent all I have on these things and now I find myself $500 short for a vendor account. Selling these on the street is not an option for me so if someone would like to partner up or sell me a account for less than $500 I would really appreciate the help. I live in the US and would only like to ship domestically. Please contact me on the main site. my username is Fenderstrat. I&#039;m willing to be generous but I won&#039;t be taken advantage of.&nbsp; Thank You.

				I am NOT a scam although I could see why you guys would think so. I have over 4 grand invested so far and I can press 4-5 pills per minute with my setup. I&#039;m not taking pics of all my product or my press but this should be good enough.

				Ha. Serious you think those pics are gonna get anyone? All you have is pics of shit anyone can pull out of their kitchen as well as a few bars and I would guess some fake looking Xanax powder. I would HAVE to see your entire supply AND your press all set up. Plus your bag of &quot;Xanax powder&quot; sure as hell isn&#039;t Xanax powder. It looks like sugar or something. Believe me a few hundred grams of Xanax powder in a plastic bag does NOT look like that.

				Fenderstrat, I believe you have bought Xanax powder off me in the past, correct? Perhaps we can set up quite the arrangement where if you are actually able to turn my powder into Xanax pills or bars I can supply you with the powder, you press them and we split profits 50/50 as obviously once my product is pressed it is worth a lot more so I would still be making more per gram of powder splitting profits with you and you would be able to sell the cheapest Xanax pills in the USA which would be amazing for both of us.....I can help you earn the money to set up a vendor account by listing your bars (I won&#039;t list the powder as I sell that) and I won&#039;t even take a cut, I just will advertise that you made them and are shipping them domestically in the USA, you&#039;ll make the $500 in no time and if the reviews come back good I&#039;ll be willing to supply you with maybe 5 grams of powder for free to start, to ensure you can actually press these things and get them sold and I can trust you and then after you prove yourself I will send much larger amounts.....<br /><br />Please message me on the road, I have always wanted to press my own bars but because of my living situation (wife/kids) I cannot and even though were splitting profits 50/50, you will get VERY rich very fast especially as you are USA domestic and pretty much all my Xanax goes into the USA as it is....Message me on the road and I will discuss actually how much we can earn together and we&#039;ll see if you wanna get this going my man....(once we talk, I bet you will)
