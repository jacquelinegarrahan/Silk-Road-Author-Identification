				I know there&#039;s a lot of catching up to do, but I&#039;ve been in resolution that&#039;s been &quot;under review&quot; since before the outage, and I was wondering when the admins were going to get around to these?<br /><br />In this case it was the now-banned WeCookUK, who scammed tens of thousands from the newbies. I was one of the lucky few who wouldn&#039;t FE, and I&#039;d REALLY like to get around to reinvesting that 2K into a reliable vendor (&#039;sup, Dutch?).<br /><br />Thanks.

				I&#039;m sure they are.<br /><br />I&#039;m just annoyed since the shitbag is still trying to get 50% of my money after having his account closed. I just wondered if they had a timetable for resoling the resolution issues. It&#039;s easier to wait when my expectations are managed.

				I&#039;ve heard that they won&#039;t review your case until the last day or so.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be too worried yet.

				Ya, I&#039;m not sure. I haven&#039;t read anything either, but maybe somebody around here has an idea. Please update us when they get to you though. I have a transaction in the resolution center that is &quot;due in&quot; two days, so I guess now I at least have some idea of what kind of wait I&#039;m in for. It&#039;s a measly 3 btcs, so I&#039;m fine waiting. But with 2k tied up, it&#039;s nice to see someone keep a level head. Not much of that lately (you know who you are) :P
