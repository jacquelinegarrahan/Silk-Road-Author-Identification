				Never used a prostitute, probably never will, but it&#039;s ridiculous that it&#039;s illegal. It should be regulated for health and safety, but attempts at prevention are foolish. I can&#039;t see any reason why an adult can pay another adult to clean the shit out of their toilet but can&#039;t pay an adult for a fucking BJ.
