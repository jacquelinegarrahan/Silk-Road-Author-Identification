				I can choose between several options, 2 of them being, bank transfer and European bank transfer. If i choose Europe bank transfer the site asks me to verify my account, it asks for pretty much all my personal information and then the site owners or something like that will review my account. I don&#039;t really feel the need to give away all my personal information. What about the regular bank transfer, will this work as well? How do you guys do it?

				I ve done all this verification thing, it took about 10 days(!) to verify my account, because the first time for some reason they rejected and I sent them all over again.<br />In the mean time I found about a much better option called bitstamp.<br />I highly recommend bitstamp.net, it does what mt gox does, but much easier. It has SEPA too, use it to save bank transfer fees.<br />Remember they still have all the info because it&#039;s a bank transfer, and your bank knows who you are...<br />

				Thanks, the site looks good. What is SEPA though, is it it just a regular bank transfer I can make from the internet?

				http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/sepa/index_en.htm<br /><br />It&#039;s a bank transfer within EU, in my country is only available via e-banking and costs about 0,5 euro, where usual bank transfers costs about 15 euros.

				Greetings scouse ;) <br /><br />Dont bother with mtgox. Fees are unclear at best and bank transfers of less than £1000 typically work out with you paying an equivalent rate of £8.75 upto £15 per bitcoin. <br /><br />If you have the time learn about irc and gpg and use bitcoin-otc. Essentially just an open chat room you can trade in anyway and any rate you agree with another user. Theres a clever semi complex method of trust and verification which is the only things making it not everyones first choice. Many times you can buy btc at below market rate and without fees but carefull as its easy to get fucked if you arent 100% on what your doing. <br />If you want simple and I mean simple download a blockchain online wallet and select the ping it add funds. By opening a ping it account And followin the instructions you can have bitcoins in less than 5 minutes. Theres 2 downsides though. They charge a 6% fee and run out of btc sometimes. (And today is one of those days unf :( <br /><br />If your half as wasteful as me youl be happy to pay a flat transparent 6% to save fucking around. Hope that helps :)

				Ugh, I personally would suggest you using www.bitcoin.de <br />Very professional and rather quick. Supports many payment different payments. SEPA and many domestic options also. <br /><br /><br />The reason why I use it, is that it only has 0,005%(Half a per cent) of commission. Which means that you get what you pay for.<br /><br />~~sitamaja
