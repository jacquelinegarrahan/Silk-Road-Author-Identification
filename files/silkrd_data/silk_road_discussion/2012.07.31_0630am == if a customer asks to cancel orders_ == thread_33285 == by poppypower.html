				A customer placed an order with me for multiple listings, two seperate listings, three x one listing and 2 x another.&nbsp; It all amounts to around 1000USD, a considerble amount.&nbsp; This lead me to run out and take down the listing.<br /><br />16hrs later I get a message that they want to cancel because the family says they need the money for the kids!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />Their stats say 4000 bitcoins spent in under one year!<br /><br />everything is packaged and ready to be shipped, what would you do?<br /><br />

				Ship the 3x or 2x , and refund the other. That way you both take a hit.

				Good customer retention is worth more then $1000 especially if the guy spends much more then that in a year.<br /><br /><br />Your goal should be to get the next few thousand too, not just this one. In this humble consumer&#039;s opinion, not know all of the details, This guy is much more likely to use your services and also recommend others do so too if you take care of him. :)

				If the guy needs the $ for his family, he shouldn&#039;t have placed the order.&nbsp; I highly doubt that is the reason he is asking to cancel the order, maybe he was drunk when purchased, etc.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know too many buyers that ever cash out bitcoin for cash, most keep it in BC for future purchases.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve only asked to cancel an order one time, it was from Tony76 and was for a g of his MDMA.&nbsp; I asked to cancel because I was drunk when ordered, and heard his product was shit after doing more research.&nbsp; This was a week before the scam.&nbsp; He cancelled it no problems.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to you man - if it&#039;s a hard product to move, I&#039;d probably not cancel it.&nbsp; If it&#039;s blow or dope, you&#039;re going to sell it eventually to someone else.&nbsp; If its in hand still, may as well cancel.

				Also, in the above Tony76 situation, if he would have refused to cancel, I wouldn&#039;t have thought any less of him, and wouldn&#039;t have held a grudge.&nbsp;

				Well do you want that customer coming back? You could always lie and say you had shipped it already and just now marked it in transit but that&#039;s very deceptive...<br /><br />I would say just cancel the order, be a good vendor. The karma will come back to you eventually and you&#039;ll keep the customer. As long as you havent shipped it out yet, there&#039;s no harm really

				As someone who placed an order, and then messaged the vendor within an hour because unforeseen circumstances forced me to take a trip for a few days (meaning I wouldn&#039;t be home, so I didn&#039;t want the order to arrive and sit there for a few days), and was refused said cancellation via a PM two days later... I can say that you should cancel the orders. I was in no way disappointed with the order (product, shipping, delivery were all great), but I will avoid that vendor now because he couldn&#039;t offer me this courtesy. Oh well, live and learn.

				Within 5 mins of me placing this post the orders disappeared, I don&#039;t know if admin saw my post and cancelled it or if the buyer contacted them and asked them to take it down.&nbsp; having spent 1000&#039;s of bitcoin perhaps admin were quick to cancel it.<br /><br />As it happened I had decided to cancel it anyway but had to get hold of my partner who had the packages ready to ship. Me cancelling depended on getting hold of them to stop them shipping.&nbsp; Within 30 mins I managed to stop them shipping.<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t know how it was cancelled, but what if it had already been shipped???&nbsp; I&#039;m a few $ out of pocket due to the stealth packaging, it&#039;s nothing but it&#039;s annoying just as a point in principle.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know if admin cancelled it, and I&#039;d like to know why they did so without checking if it had been shipped?&nbsp; What is SR policy on this?&nbsp; <br /><br />I think all vendors should cancel in such situation providing it&#039;s not shipped already, long term customer relations are far more important than a quick buck.&nbsp; I would have prefered not to get a sob story, I agree if you&#039;re spending that amount of $ regulary then you should make sure there is enough left over for your kids in emergency, <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Whoa.&nbsp; Are they even allowed to intervene in a situation like this?&nbsp; As you said, what if you already shipped it out? 16 hours is not nearly close enough time to cancel an order.... it has to be powered by admin or you.
