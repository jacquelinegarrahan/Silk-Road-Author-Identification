				DPR has fallen to the old siren song of &quot;change me&quot;, for absolutely no reason.

				I liked them, but its not a real big deal. <br /><br />I just like having options to break down how things are organized.

				One of the first things I noticed was the missing numbers. I like the new update, but frankly I liked the simplicity of the old one better, This one uses a lot of screen space for the pictures. It&#039;s not like this website had to be updated due to competitive forces! I guess I&#039;ll give it a few days before I judge it any further, since usability is the name of the game in the long run

				There some good practical reasons to not have the numbers listed next to categories.<br /><br />1. It&#039;s kind of inelegant, it&#039;s not something you see on Amazon or Ebay for this reason.<br />2. The number of listings gives open source intelligence to LEO free of charge. They should be forced to do their homework instead.<br />3. The numbers are not a reliable guide to SR anyway, because not all listings are publicly available.<br />4. The numbers are not a reliable guide even if they were, because listings are used in different ways by vendors.<br />5. You&#039;re going to survey a couple of vendors, do a search or visit your usual vendor anyway. They are redundant.<br /><br />And I&#039;m sure others can think of more.

				I agree with you Pine and also the numbers were not always accurate considering the time it takes for the page to update or if vendors went MIA while leaving their listings up. The numbers were something that people got spoiled to even tho they really don&#039;t need it so now that it&#039;s gone there&#039;s a small void for some people

				touche lol....good points, hadn&#039;t looked at it that way...and ya you&#039;re right ralph it is only a small void, everything else looks good! more pros than cons with the update IMO.

I have lots of different things here from original un crossed NL seeds to shrooms, and even a bunch of grow stuff I may get rid of. I often would give a category a once over to see if it was worth listing the items.&nbsp; If the category was loaded with lots of competition I may put off the listing for a while and wait for a better time to list. <br /><br />Oh well, just more work on my side.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)
