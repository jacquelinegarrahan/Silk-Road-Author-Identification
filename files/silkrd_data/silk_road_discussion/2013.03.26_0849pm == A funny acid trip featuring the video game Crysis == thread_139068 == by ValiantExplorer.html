				Instead of boring you with the usual spiritual stuff usually connected with LSD, which I’m sure you are more than accustomed to and is, besides, a rather subjective experience, I will tell you the fun part of my most recent exploration.<br /><br />After the first four hours of my trip, when I knew that soon the effect will start to wear off, I decided to play a bit of Crysis. This was only my 2nd LSD trip, and the first one with acid bought from Silk Road. Since I take these substances rarely and with great respect, I tend to try as many things as possible while under the effect (which I believe is the route many of you take as well).<br /><br />So, I tried to play a few games, just to see what kind of influence they would have on my trip. I should note that I’m a rather positive person and I never experienced ANY negative effect from LSD (out of 3 trips so far). But I wanted to play something to see if I get scared and such. Toying with fire a bit, but I was confident if anything bad happens I can pull myself out with some nice music.<br /><br />I fired up Crysis, which I had prepared with a nice beach level where I could explore the nice island where the action of the game takes place. It’s a very large level so plenty to do eh? For those unfamiliar with Crysis, this is a rather famous first person shooter where you are in control of a super soldier augmented with a very fancy suit capable of cloaking, increased armor, speed and stuff like that.<br /><br />My save point was after I had already killed almost everybody in the area. There was one lone North Korean patrol boat around. I got into a boat of my own and killed them rather easily, which wasn’t very surprising to me since I’m a rather seasoned gamer and LSD doesn’t severely hamper reflexes.<br /><br />Now, after dispatching the Korean boat, I brought my own boat back on the beach and… here I was a super-soldier, on an island paradise. So what I did do? Of course I could go and continue the rest of the level, kill “bad” guys. Instead, I went into options and calmly searched for a certain key binding. I found it. I exited the options menu and pressed that key about 4 times. All my weapons now lay on the ground. And… I started swimming.<br /><br />Yup. I just swam around in the sea, watching the sparse vegetation in it, and the occasional fish bank. The graphical engine is pretty good and I can run it at maximum settings so it was pretty neat! :D.<br /><br />But wait. There is more a super soldier can do! Using my suit’s awesome powers, I climbed upon a rock, and using the enhanced strength ability, I… well… um… I executed a nice, long jump in the water :D. Weeeeeeeeee… swim super-soldier, swiiiiiim!!!<br /><br />In the meantime, the North Koreans (if they had the Artificial Intelligence to) were probably looking completely dumbfounded as to why THE FUCK the American soldier is taking dips in the water instead of hunting them down. As for my superiors… well, luckily there is no time limit in the game :D.<br /><br />And since I just can’t help it, I’m still going to drop one “philosophical” nugget here. On LSD, I stopped perceiving the North Koreans as the bad guys *even in the game* (because in real life of course I don’t consider anybody a “bad guy”). Every reader of this post I suppose is an educated and intelligent person and understands that indeed, no human being is bad, but just a passenger in its own life, shaped by social conditions, education and experience. We are all inherently good.<br /><br />Other than that, it was an awesome trip. Great powerful stuff, which, if anybody cares, I got from FartBomber (I took a single of his Avatar tabs). And if this sounds like advertisement, know that it is NOT. I haven’t the slightest interest in advertising for anybody. I am not a regular purchaser since, as I said, I only seldom use these wonderful substances (which of course should also be taken into consideration, since me rating something as “powerful” may be weak for others). <br /><br />But FartBomber does deserve kudos for delivering on time, every time I ordered from him (3 times so far) and from what I talked with him, seems like a swell person. If anything, I would advise people to be careful with shipments from UK, as I missed two shipments from some sellers there (I won’t name them because I honestly believe this was a post office problem, but UK post seems to be kinda’ evil).<br /><br />However, if anybody or anything requires advertisement, it is Silk Road. Through Silk Road, I have expanded my knowledge of the INNER Universe, which wouldn’t have been possible otherwise, since us westerners are so caught up in our (silly?) daily lives. I never had the opportunity to meet street dealers so Silk Road offered me a secure way to conduct something I always wanted to: the exploration of my own mind.<br /><br />Thank you all for being here and making this work.
