				I&#039;m unsure on rules of weather we are allowed to link to clearweb articles. If we aren&#039;t, please feel free to remove the link. I provided a transcript of the article below.<br /><br /><br />CISPA DOA in the Senate, For Now<br />hxxp://reason.com/blog/2013/04/25/cispa-doa-in-the-senate-for-now<br />Transcript<br /><br />---<br />A representative of the Senate committee that would have to hold hearings on the cybersecurity bill CISPA, passed last week by the House, said the committee won’t be taking the legislation up, according to U.S. News. President Obama has threatened a veto, though the Democratic chairman of the committee Jay Rockefeller, certainly echoes the administration when he says CISPA is nevertheless important.<br /><br />The White House’s veto threat, meanwhile, isn’t couched in a call to limit federal power, nor even in a defense of privacy, but to make sure corporations are “held accountable.” The White House is satisfied that the legislation charges the federal government with protecting privacy, essentially policing itself, but also wants corporations to be required to remove certain personal information from data shared with the federal government.<br /><br />But the problem with CISPA is the sharing of data itself; terms of service govern the privacy of data shared voluntarily between consumers and corporations. As supporters of CISPA claim those corporations want this legislation, the solution would seem not to require it. Companies are free to include provisions in their privacy policies allowing for data sharing with the governments, just as consumers are free to reject them. As for the companies themselves, their cybersecurity would seem to be their responsibility, not an excuse to extend federal powers into the private sector. Hacking and other cyberattacks are already federal crimes after all.<br />---

				Wonderful news.&nbsp; I have no doubt there&#039;ll be another one next month, but at least this month there won&#039;t be.&nbsp; Now if only things weren&#039;t getting worse faster than they could ever be fixed, we might just get somewhere...

				Great news.<br /><br />But we don&#039;t give enough acknowledgment to the people/website/organizations fighting every day to stop bullshit like SOPA and CISPA.<br /><br />If you want to actually help stop things like CISPA, donate to the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation). Come on, I know some of you vendors are sitting on some serious cash. I donate what I can. But don&#039;t donate until you research the EFF a bit for yourself, if you don&#039;t already know about what they do.

				Sorry guys, but most of the horrid things that this CISPA would make legal (in a perverse way), have been going on anyway under the radar, and in spite of their unlawfulness.<br /><br />Check out Abby Martin on today&#039;s show, she explains it. I think you can catch the episodes on Hulu and on youtube (youtube/breakingtheset or youtube/breaking_the_set, I&#039;m not sure which, but you can search for it).<br /><br />So it&#039;s specious to breath a sigh of relief, it&#039;s going on anyway.<br /><br />goblin

				Thankfully. It did not go through. How crazy is it that the majority of the public doesn&#039;t even know what it CISPA is at all.
