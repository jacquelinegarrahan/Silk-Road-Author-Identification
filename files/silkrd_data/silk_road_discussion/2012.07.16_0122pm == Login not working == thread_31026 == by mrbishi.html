				I type the correct address to get to the login page, type the correct details to log in, but the page just reloads with blank boxes where I put my details in. I have tried registering a new account and when I do that I end up at the same place. Is this clear enough for you to understand? The same is happening at bmr so something strange is going on

				that&#039;s weird, it works with my account and I tried making a new one and that worked too.<br /><br />I think it should say &quot;Login failed, please try again&quot; if you get any of the fields wrong, it says so right? <br />be sure to use this address: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/ <br /><br />happens it fails for me too, a time or few, but always lets me on after a few tries though..<br />maybe somethings weird with your browser, are you using the default TOR browser-bundle?&nbsp; try re-downloaded that incase youve got an old version or something?<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know if this is related but I had a WEIRD experience just now:<br /><br />I entered my loginname + PW and then... like ten instances of Abiword opened up, their filename (they all had the same one) looked like a hash.&nbsp; The documents themselves were blank.<br /><br />I immediately assumed the account was compromised and created a new one.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; I *did* have a page open in another tab just now and it could&#039;ve been that page what did it, and nothing to do with the Silk Road login.&nbsp; But I just assumed the worst.
