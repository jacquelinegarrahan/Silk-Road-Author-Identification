				Hey Vendors,<br />&nbsp; Since this sale was announced Tuesday me and many other SR members have been scrambling to put bitcoins into our accounts.&nbsp; &nbsp;So much so that a few of us are getting scammed for it.&nbsp; If you would like to extend your sale for us members who don&#039;t want to rush getting our bitcoins please let us know here.&nbsp; My own situation is that i won&#039;t have any bitcoins in my account until Tuesday.&nbsp; <br /><br />Post here.<br /><br />

				Damod, <br />For a newbie like me, how do I buy the bitcoins? Also how do I avoid getting scammed when buying them? Do you have a site that you recommend over others? TIA -Dailycoffee21

				You can&#039;t just show up here and start trying to buy things without taking the time to read and educate yourself first.<br /><br />Sure, you&#039;re trying to get money so you won&#039;t miss the sale.&nbsp; Even if you miss the sale, SR will still be around.&nbsp; I won&#039;t even be buying anything from the sale despite already having BTC in my account because I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good idea - what better time for the USPS to step up their inspections and cooperate with LE?&nbsp; Anyway I know it&#039;s being paranoid, but sometimes paranoia pays off.<br /><br />I would recommend steering clear of the major exchanges like Mt. Gox and Tradehill, but if you do end up using them make sure you know what you&#039;re doing and you don&#039;t link your BTC transaction to your real identity at any point.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using MP to buy BTC.&nbsp; There are many reputable vendors on this site who you can go through.&nbsp; The ABSOLUTE WORST thing for you to do is to get a big&nbsp; moneypak and start waving it around the forums like other people are doing, screaming I HAVE A BUNCH OF MONEY, WHO WANTS TO TAKE IT FROM ME FOR FREE?<br /><br />If you walk in here and treat it like ebay or amazon, you&#039;re going to have a terrible experience, probably lose money, and worst case scenario end up in prison.<br /><br />Be intelligent people.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; Read.&nbsp; Educate yourself.&nbsp; Think things through.&nbsp; Don&#039;t jump into things if you can&#039;t verify that you&#039;re being 100% safe and secure.
