				Is anyone else having trouble connecting? I need to finalize a couple orders and haven&#039;t been able to get on all morning. <br /><br />LexiSadie and Mr Ddro: I can&#039;t get to the damn site yet again. I&#039;ll finalize as soon as I can. <br /><br />SR really needs to get the server situation under control. It seems like it goes down every week. It&#039;s not like SR is free either. We&#039;re all paying a percentage for each order. I understand for security reasons it can only be hosted in limited locations, but isn&#039;t there a safe company to use that can keep the page up? Site down = money lost for vendors and SR.

				Must be on my end then. It&#039;s odd that I don&#039;t have any trouble getting on the forums.<br /><br />Edit: I finally got on. Might have been because I didn&#039;t have the newest version of the Tor Browser. I got on yesterday with no problem. Who knows.

				Site is blazing fast for me lately.<br /><br />While it&#039;s probably not ideal from a security standpoint, once I&#039;m on a good exit node, I leave my browser bundle running for days at a time.

				It&#039;s funny how everyone assumes the site itself went down every time there&#039;s a connection issue. My experience tells me it is more likely connection issues being caused by how long tor keeps connections alive and assholes trying to crack SR account passwords by brute force and/or denial of service attacks. If either of those were to overwhelm any of the nodes SR is behind, you get&nbsp; connection errors. Lately I&#039;ve been experiencing blank pages without a timeout. Only other time I&#039;ve come across this is in RL while hosting websites that were being hit with ddos attacks and such.

				i often have trouble connecting due to timeouts, but found that if i refresh the page or restart the tor browser this solves the problem 99% of the time and i am able to connect. anyone out there using dialup and tor?
