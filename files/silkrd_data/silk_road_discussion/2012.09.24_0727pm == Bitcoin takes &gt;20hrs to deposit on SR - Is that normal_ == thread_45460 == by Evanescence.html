				So I&#039;m heading past the 20hr mark now and my account still shows no deposit.<br /><br />Watched the transfer progress as it took a couple hours for 55 confirmations to show up on the sending side, so that all looks good.<br /><br />Double checked the address used to deposit matches on both ends.<br /><br />Any ideas?

				Kinda new to this whole thing, but I did what you did (check both ends of addy) and made smaller test deposit first and after success made larger, both took less then 2 hours. So it would seem that 20 is not normal, hope you didn&#039;t lose too much.

				I&#039;m kinda new myself, but got the same result as CH, took 2 hours total for BTC&#039;s to appear in my SR wallet.&nbsp; I only recall seeing 6 confirmations prior to the transfer completing, not sure if there were anymore.&nbsp; blockchain.info looks about the same as it did when I deposited, with new blocks being gen&#039;ed every 30-40 minutes.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen others report delays like you&#039;re seeing, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen a follow-up from anyone, just messages from others to be patient, and usually something regarding &quot;tumbling&quot;.&nbsp; Maybe a note to tech support would in order since you&#039;re coming up on 24 hours...good luck, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get your Coins, and hopefully it&#039;s sooner rather than later..

				Thanks all for the input.<br /><br />24hrs still nothing.<br /><br />140 USD is not the end of the world but it would certainly suck to lose it.<br /><br />Never really knew about / though about tech support so maybe I dig around for how to do that.<br />

				contact SR support, there may be something that went wrong. in the past coins have not showed up and SR took care of it if they actually never showed, they will be able to tell and help you out. it shouldnt take that long

				After a bit more research it looks like there is some recent SR issue causing a fair amount deposits to delay for long periods of time.<br /><br />I&#039;m talking 72 hours or more, see here:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=44551.0<br /><br />This is really not cool.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can&#039;t even find yet how to contact support - should be a damn sticky in the tech support forum.
