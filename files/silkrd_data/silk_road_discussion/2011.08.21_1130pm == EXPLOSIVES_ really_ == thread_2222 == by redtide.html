				Now I suppose we will hear all about how everyone needs explosives to protect their family and how the constitution guarantees every American a pound of c4. And explosives don&#039;t kill people etc.&nbsp; Seriously someone explain how this doesn&#039;t draw undue attention?

				You just noticed the ad?&nbsp; It was one of the first things I saw when I first joined a month and a half ago.<br /><br />I do agree though, if anything is going to get LE to try and track someone down, it&#039;s guns and explosives.<br /><br />I could see them ordering something, then trying to backtrack the order in order to figure out where it was sent from, then try and narrow it down.<br /><br />He lists PETN, which is the stuff the shoe bomber was using and that guy who only managed to burn his underwear.<br /><br />I&#039;m all for free information, books and stuff, but sending explosives through the mail does seem a little extreme to me.&nbsp; I can just see some disgruntled kid ordering up some of this stuff and blowing up his principal then hearing on the news that they checked his computer and found out he had ordered the stuff from SR.<br /><br />That would go over well, don&#039;t you think.&nbsp; :-\

				In the seller&#039;s guide, it lists &quot;weapons of mass destruction (chemical/bio weaponry, nukes, and anything used to make them)&quot; as restricted items. I wonder if explosives fall into that category?

				@MrDdroMcGillacutty<br /><br />I agree with almost everything you say.&nbsp; I believe people should have the freedom to buy, own and use just about anything their little hearts desire.&nbsp; In the end it makes no difference to me what this guy sells.&nbsp; I was simply making an observation.<br /><br />If you think the landed homies in the US look at someone selling a couple of ounces of pot and someone selling a pound of PETN the same, I think you are mistaken.<br /><br />As mentioned in the Sellers Guide (as someone has already posted):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Please do not list anything who&#039;s purpose is to harm or defraud, such as stolen credit cards, counterfeit currency, personal info, assassinations, and weapons of mass destruction (chemical/bio weaponry, nukes, and anything used to make them).<br />Please do not list anything related to pedophelia.<br /><br />Practically speaking, there are many powerful adversaries of Silk Road and if we are to survive, we must not take them all on at once. Additionally, if you try to please everyone, you will wind up pleasing no one. So certain things are restricted just so we don&#039;t scare too many off.<br /><br />On a moral level, we take the high road, pun intended ;). Those who seek to control the behavior of their neighbors through force are immoral. Silk Road exists to circumvent that force and provide a safe-haven where civilized people can come together in peace for mutual benefit. To allow listings of items designed to defraud or harm innocent people would be to stoop to the level of the very people we are standing up to.<br /><br />If you are unsure about a listing, just drop us a line and we&#039;ll let you know. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A couple of months ago when this hit the news:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Two U.S. senators said Sunday they will ask federal authorities to crack down on a secretive narcotics market operated on the Internet with anonymous sales and untraceable currency.<br /><br />Heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines are among the drugs being sold in the well-protected website apparently operating for just a few months.<br /><br />Sens. Charles Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, both Democrats, said they asked the Justice Department and Drug Enforcement Administration to shut down and investigate the website, often referred to as the Silk Road after an ancient Asian trade route.<br /><br />&quot;This audacious website should be shut down immediately,&quot; Manchin said.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There was a big kerfuffle for a while and then it just started to fade away.&nbsp; People are always hearing about some big drug bust or something else related to drugs.&nbsp; It&#039;s old news.&nbsp; Sure LE wants to stop it, but they have lots of other things on their plates, so I imagine unless someone on the inside comes right out and helps them, it will just sit on the back burner.<br /><br />But what if those Senators had said something along the lines of SR being a site where home grown terrorists can buy explosives and books on how to make them, totally anonymously?&nbsp; I tend to think that might get a bigger response.<br /><br />Maybe it will, maybe it wont.&nbsp; In the end it&#039;s no skin off my nose who sells what on SR.<br /><br />Simply making the observation, exactly as SR did in their sellers guide, that the more adversaries you have, the more likely you are to get hit.<br /><br />But this guy has been around for awhile and SR hasn&#039;t done anything, which I assume means they are OK with it.&nbsp; So although I will make the observation that I believe selling explosives increases overall risk to SR, it is SR&#039;s call, not ours, and I will go with the flow.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t increasing my risk, that&#039;s the same no matter who sells what.<br /><br />Hopefully I don&#039;t live next door to the disgruntled teenager who buys that pound of PETN.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I just want SR to keep going for as long as possible.<br /><br />Amen<br />&nbsp;:D

				Jeeze! Where do I start?<br /><br />Yes, explosives. What kind of childhood did you have?

Do you know how government budgets are determined and maintained? It&#039;s not in their interest to pinch a guy here or there (unless they have personal reasons or are baiting for bigger fish) and it sure doesn&#039;t pay to show that all they need are a few really good nerds and not teams of guys in full SWAT gear.<br />If they want to stop traffic they could just put a cop on the busiest dealing corners.

The package probably comes with 101 reasons to hate the US and a map of likely targets.<br />If they &quot;instruct&quot; private gun dealers to sell arms to Mexican gangs, guns whose intentions and probable uses are well known, they can and will do just about anything.<br /><br />All to maintain the War on Budget Reduction&quot;...errr I mean the &quot;War on falling prices of the Intelligence Communities primary black op funding goods&quot;.......No, I remember:<br />The War on Drugs! Yeah that&#039;s it.<br /><br /><br />And your not in a &quot;community&quot; here. You are a guest of SR on his private property. If you don&#039;t like, leave. Hang YOUR balls out there and compete with him. I&#039;ll bet he&#039;d even share his business model and techniques with you.

The package probably comes with 101 reasons to hate the US and a map of likely targets.<br />If they &quot;instruct&quot; private gun dealers to sell arms to Mexican gangs, guns whose intentions and probable uses are well known, they can and will do just about anything.<br /><br />All to maintain the War on Budget Reduction&quot;...errr I mean the &quot;War on falling prices of the Intelligence Communities primary black op funding goods&quot;.......No, I remember:<br />The War on Drugs! Yeah that&#039;s it.<br /><br /><br />And your not in a &quot;community&quot; here. You are a guest of SR on his private property. If you don&#039;t like, leave. Hang YOUR balls out there and compete with him. I&#039;ll bet he&#039;d even share his business model and techniques with you. He seems like the sort who knows what damage patents and monopoly do to society.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />nice. you&#039;re shadow boxing, friend.

				I amazes me how everyone start talking like a hard-ass or telling me to mind my own business.<br />If that&#039;s your best response, then it&#039;s weak.<br /><br />BTC Freedom- (the only reasoned response so far) I think it&#039;s about intent. If the intent<br />is to sell explosive components, then I object. I know everyone loves this wild west fantasy.<br />But the consequences of this stuff are tragic and immutable.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe in contributing to violence in the world. It&#039;s ethics. <br /><br />What if I were to list for sale the shipping info of buyers? would that be OK too? Anything goes right?<br />We all have our vices here. But do we really want to say that everything is acceptable? <br />and BTW some of you are arguing for things that are against the Seller&#039;s Guide. <br /><br />Take them somewhere else. <br /><br />You could start an SR knock off called Gats &amp; Grenades.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Gats and Grenades. I love it.&nbsp; Almost as much as selling buyers info. Great stuff. Really. I simply do not have a problem with explosives, guns, chemicals, assorted drugs (hard or soft), or whatever else ya got for sale. Don&#039;t lecture me about morals OR ethics. Everyone is different. I think we all can at least agreed that selling buyer info is wrong. Ya gotta draw the line somewhere, lol. Ya7<br /><br />You want to ban something? Start with LE and scammers.

Your own opinion. You then proceed with textbook projection and imply that LE of all sorts thinks about it the same way you do.<br /><br />That&#039;s is hateful, selfish and ignorant. It&#039;s also dangerous. There is at least a 400:1 ratio of real hard facts.<br /><br />It&#039;s general public knowledge that LE uses the &#039;drugs pay for terrorism&#039; argument to use all the same resources on drugs as they do on other things....<br /><br />You&#039;re lying to support your agenda and impose your own version of &quot;RedTide&#039;s Government&quot; here. SR is a free marketplace. Get over yourself.<br /><br />Your assertion that LE thinks Guns and Explosives (in small quantities) is a big deal, is entirely baseless. Where is the &quot;War on Explosives?&quot; Oh, but there is a &quot;War on Drugs.&quot; Stop lying man... You know you&#039;re lying, and that makes you a propagandist. My more than 30 years of experience in the matter shows an overwhelmingly one-sided effort to impose LE resources against drugs, and almost nothing against other contraband. Not only is your argument untrue, it&#039;s the opposite of reality. No matter how much of a Zealot you are for that agenda, it won&#039;t make it become true...<br /><br />Your lies are transparent, and your arguments are based upon those lies. You&#039;re trying to impose your own Laws, using the same old propaganda and lies. That&#039;s it. Period.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t name calling when it&#039;s true. When have you ever met a Tyrant or Propagandist who WASN&#039;T well-spoken? The Devil wouldn&#039;t be very effective if he had red horns, a pointy tail, and a pitchfork... I don&#039;t need to worry about that, or what my &#039;image&#039; is, because I speak only truth. I don&#039;t care if a crowd of people believes me, or thinks I look cool. I&#039;m not here to put on a show. My beef is with liars and hate-mongers.

				Another newbie, but I think I will offer my 0.02 BTC.<br /><br />As a European guns and explosives are not in my culture, but however they are in others. <br /><br />Who is right? <br /><br />Both sides have valid points, I side on the no guns or weapons but that is as I say a cultural issue for me rather than fears of LE storming in.<br /><br />Not selling weapons doesn&#039;t take away from the fact that SR is offering a multitude of illegal goods for sale.<br /><br />You are not selling to a single market but worldwide, in some countries drugs will be seen as the number one issue and not weapons. It is not for me to say that SR should sell certain items or it should not, I am here to buy drugs others want other services and products, SR is already is on the radar of LE and will be without the weapons. <br /><br />This is a call for the operators of SR and their feelings on the matter weighing up the pros and cons and the risk to them and not the risk to us.<br /><br />I assume, but may be wrong, that if a major terrorist wanted to get hold of weapons and explosives SR probably isn&#039;t going to be their first port of call, they have plenty of axis of evil states for that. Why risk sending this stuff through the mail? It is a huge weak link in your plans, the only benefit is the private nature of the deals, but there are ways to get that in RL as well, without running the risk of putting stuff&nbsp; through a government delivery service.<br /><br />Also shutting down SR? <br /><br />My opinion is that SR is a great source of intelligence to LE, why shut it down?<br /><br />Much better to let it run, conduct sting operations and find people behind the deals. That is how LE works they will use methods to infiltrate to get personal data and leads and build multiple lines of evidence. they will wait for someone to make a mistake get information on them use leverage to move up the chain etc.<br /><br />Also difficult to &quot;shut down&quot; in the traditional sense, unless they find the infrastructure and operators and then it will pop up under new management with stronger security and the game will continue.<br /><br />At the end of the day if the owners of SR feel it is worth taking the incremental risk over and above all the other illegal items they are facilitating the sale of, it is their call. SR isn’t a democracy; it is a business and market place with a large customer feedback and comments section.<br /><br />If people vote with their virtual feet because of the sale of weapons then they will change their business model.<br /><br />Oh and if you can’t argue without resorting to ad hominem then you’ve lost already.<br /><br />Finally I&#039;m glad I found this place and mainly due to the press it had gotten already, without that I wouldn&#039;t be here, probably similar to many others.

				i&#039;m sure if explosives were as easy to get as drugs are, there would be a major war on explosives as well.&nbsp; the average person can find drugs a lot easier than explosives.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see how allowing explosives actually helps SR either.&nbsp; To me they just seem like added incentive for LE.&nbsp; You can do a lot more damage with those products than a hand gun or a switch blade.&nbsp; If you have a legitimate reason to buy them, then you wouldn&#039;t need to get them from SR.

				Though we all may agree or disagree on the sale of explosives, they do have a potential for serious harm and therefore should not be permitted.&nbsp; Most likely the majority of the people here do not believe terrorism to be good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Start shipping around that stuff and conspiracy to commit a terrorist act could come up.&nbsp; I would steer clear of that shit, it only causes a shitload of trouble and it&#039;s really not worth it AT ALL.

Survival of the fittest. Doesn&#039;t always mean physically fit. It could mean mentally strong and smart. I repeat, don&#039;t be a dumbass.<br /><br />You can&#039;t save everyone every time.

				Since now i can finally reply to this thread now that the forum issue was fixed anyways so here is the deal <br /><br />During my listing for explosives I did 17 sales outside of escrow each of which went through some Q and A&nbsp; I din&#039;t just sell to anyone I did my due diligence to the best of my ability having been in the explosives field for about 15 years you get a good grasp of people who ask for certain items certain ways ect ect ect basically you get a good idea of what they intend to do and there level of experience<br /><br />I didn&#039;t just go shipping a pound of RDX to just anyone and I most certainly didn&#039;t ship HE&#039;s with cap&#039;s ect ect most my charges i shipped were linear / spherical shaped charges and some small hobbyist charges (just go out have some fun sort of stuff) <br /><br />and lastly I had a custom order for 8 RDX filled titanium alloy MK2 clones (this order took alot of verification) simply because the nature of the item and honestly i can&#039;t go into alot of detail but the person whom bought it was a serviceman <br /><br />so yeah that kind of gives you an Idea of me and who I am I did get ALOT of negative attention from this listing so I actually closed the AD but I will be putting up 2 new ad&#039;s I hope before month end for some less destructive &quot;hobbyist&quot; salutes and such <br /><br />cheers for your interest and concerns and next time feel free to message me on SR if you have a concern as im a very friendly guy who is open to suggestions <br /><br />-warweed

				Also if you&#039;re dumb enough to buy explosives off here keep in mind that if you do a bomb is going to go off in your city and you&#039;re going to get framed for it.

				Three things that should be insta banned from this site.<br /><br />1. CP<br /><br />2. guns<br /><br />3. explosives<br /><br /><br />Are the Admins of SR this naive?&nbsp; Is this site ran by 20 year olds who are still mad at their parents?&nbsp;

				Agree...I think CP and untraceable/unmarked/fully automatic guns and explosives should be banned from SR.&nbsp; If you need a gun, go buy one legally.&nbsp; For you to desire to buy a gun illegally on here, means you have some pretty obvious intentions for that said weapon.&nbsp; Sure you can bring that argument to the table that some irresponsible kid ODing on drugs bought off SR will bring the same kind of unwanted press about Silk Road as someone buying an untraceable gun and shooting their baby sister in the face.&nbsp; But the chances of the ODing happening is much lower than the kid buying an untraceable gun with obvious intent to do something malicious.
