I used to always transfer in what I thought I would need, and then transfer whatever was left over back to another wallet. I was always afraid of my SR wallet getting hacked. I finally convinced myself to store my leftover coins on SR until I was ready to make another buy. D&#039;oh! Fortunately it was only about 85 USD.<br /><br />I had 2 outstanding orders from last weekend: one shipped Monday, the other Tuesday. I got the one that shipped Monday. I was able to log on to SR on Tuesday to finalize and I saw that the 2nd order shipped. That one I haven&#039;t gotten yet. As long as the seller shipped it before the site was taken down, I&#039;m not worried about it. If, on the other hand, the vendor figured out the site was shut down before he put it in the mail, then I doubt I&#039;ll get it. Why would he send it if he knew I couldn&#039;t finalize and that there&#039;s no more resolution? But it&#039;s less than $100 worth of stuff that I have outstanding.<br /><br />BUT, if I made it through 2 years and 30k worth of transactions, without going to prison, that&#039;d be a very small price to pay. I too feel the same pain and sadness as you though. I will miss SR and that awesome fucking vendors I meant. I only had maybe 3 bad transactions the entire time, and they were all cancelled, so I never got burnt. That&#039;s a fucking hell of a lot more than I can say about my IRL drug buying!

				I had 5 small orders in transit my VERY FIRST SR orders (just my luck), about $150 in escrow and $30 in my account. Just finally got my first order today, hoping like hell the others come. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll at least get some of them, surely at least one or two of the vendors actually shipped when they said they did. I guess I can&#039;t complain, I know others (particularly the vendors) lost A LOT more. Still sucks though, especially since it took me forever to work up the nerve to finally put in an order and then this happens. Freaked me out enough that I probably won&#039;t be buying drugs online again for awhile, maybe ever. It does suck dealing with the street game, but at least with that I have a better idea of what I&#039;m dealing with.
