				not sure if this is the right board, but whatever haha<br /><br />so i had just a general question that i thought might make for good discussion:<br /><br />without getting into too much intimate detail (unless you are comfortable with that), what kind of profits are SR vendors pulling down? i know everyone deals in different merch and different quantities. do you sell as a main source of income? supplementary cash? is it just a hobby that you enjoy but dont profit much from it?<br /><br />for me, i dont think i&#039;d take the risk unless i knew my profit margin would be pretty substantial. what about you chaps?

				Pretty sure some of the top vendors make a killing. You can do some quick math by looking at their product offerings and the amount of feedback they have on their SR profile if you&#039;re really curious.

				To a degree - they set the cap on transactions showing now which is good from a snooping-DEA-agent perspective.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure some of them do.&nbsp; I make it respectable on here myself, but that&#039;s only because I&#039;m not selling as many small amounts as a lot of the top vendors in my category (the top ones mostly sell 1gram - 1/8).&nbsp; I do a lot of 1/2 oz - 1oz packages, and have also had a good number of QP&#039;s go out, but they only show up as out of escrow orders.&nbsp; My volume is not as high but I would be willing to bet my per-transaction is far higher that most of the others in my category.
