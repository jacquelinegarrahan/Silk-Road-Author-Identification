				Too true, think smartly...<br /><br />It&#039;s time for the MODS to get together and go to the backup plan to<br />ensure a smooth transition. There is way too much money involved <br />here for there not to be a plan in place. Turn up the backup servers,<br />get the URL&#039;s posted, and get all the transactional logs for BTC back<br />online.<br /><br />It should have been done already, but the initial panic has to subside<br />and rational thinking/actions get moving. Everyone knew this may <br />one day happen, and only stupidity would have no recourse to restoration.

				It seems they did not take all the money. Clearnet news confirms $3.6M worth of BTC (about 26000) being seized. There must be a heck of a lot more in wallets and escrow. Perhaps this was (just) DPR&#039;s own money - lets not panick yet and hope some of the backups will come online and we can see the status there. <br /><br />BTC are dropping in value rapidly though (4% in the last hour, on thick volume), so even they are recoverd they may not be worth as much :(

				POOL PGP KEYS<br />==============<br />Vendors and to a lesser extent buyers may have difficulty proving they are who they say they are in the event that the SR data set has been lost. <br />** Therefore it is vital that PGP public keys for vendors are retained and pooled. ** <br />I have many stored and I am sure that many of you also have them stored. There is a PGP key thread in the security forum but it is 130 pages which is a lot to mirror and I&#039;m not convinced it has that many vendors in it.<br /><br />DON&#039;T PANIC<br />==========<br />Silkroad architecture hopefully involves the use of hidden service servers that host the entry point rather than the website and database itself. I hope. If this is the case then it is possible that only the entry points are compromised rather than the web servers and the database which obviously is where the real deal is. Speculation but good security would suggest this is mandatory - I don&#039;t hold out a great deal of hope as there would be immense pressure on anyone in custody to provide access to all known servers. Hopefully SR team employ compartmentalization and two man rule for certain operations and DPR is not a god user across everything. <br /><br />

				We lost 64 coins too, everybody lost alot of money, some had to be in the hundreds of thousands because of the amounts in escrow. but this is miniscule. If we get this back up and running we will all be making money again.but first things first:<br /><br />We need to have a backup place for atleast the vendors and mods to communicate. if we cant communicate all is lost for good as everybody separates. The buyers will follow where the vendors go. I never claimed my bond refund and dont have roundtable access as i never needed it but an IRC channel is always an option. We should also ALL agree on a place, a mod or somebody with authority needs to post where everybody will go to. Without the whole community on the same page everything will fall apart.<br /><br />If this is all true, the forums will be gone before long and we have to be able to speak on a professional level somewhere. New dpr may be gone but we are still here. We can all put in our 2 cents but in reality all anybody wants is a new place, screw the coins, screw the orders processing, we just need some other medium that will replace SR if this is how it seems, and somebody just needs to say when and where. If its not then when stay but that does not look promising.<br /><br />also why does it say district court of NY on the seizure page?

				quote author=This_is_not_SOCA link=topic=216404.msg1581836#msg1581836 date=1380735524]<br />POOL PGP KEYS<br />==============<br />Vendors and to a lesser extent buyers may have difficulty proving they are who they say they are in the event that the SR data set has been lost. <br />** Therefore it is vital that PGP public keys for vendors are retained and pooled. ** <br />I have many stored and I am sure that many of you also have them stored. There is a PGP key thread in the security forum but it is 130 pages which is a lot to mirror and I&#039;m not convinced it has that many vendors in it.<br /><br />DON&#039;T PANIC<br />==========<br />Silkroad architecture hopefully involves the use of hidden service servers that host the entry point rather than the website and database itself. I hope. If this is the case then it is possible that only the entry points are compromised rather than the web servers and the database which obviously is where the real deal is. Speculation but good security would suggest this is mandatory - I don&#039;t hold out a great deal of hope as there would be immense pressure on anyone in custody to provide access to all known servers. Hopefully SR team employ compartmentalization and two man rule for certain operations and DPR is not a god user across everything.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />This iS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW WORTHLESS AND SHITTY PGP IS. I Do know that the &quot;NEW&quot; DPR is who was arrested SO THAT means the original gangster is out and around, that of course is great news for al of us. It has yet&nbsp; to be seen how they busted dpr. And when that comes out that wil give us a lot more information.<br />As far as the switch being thrown so that SR would kick al your outstanding balances back to you is kind of a myth. there absolutely is something like that but it would not get hit anytime son.<br />WE really need to wait for the arrest affidavit to come out..that will tel us so much information.<br /><br />Of course my attorney is already in action to get the information of what legally went down. And as son as I get it i will post it and over time you will see that I will get accurate information out as son as it is available<br /><br />Another thing to point out is at this time we all need to come together and be on each others side and be patient. Of course we know that a lot of the druggies on this site act like animals when ever anything go&#039;s wrong. These people (if you want to cal them that) just feel the need to get attention and act like ass holes.<br /><br /><br />It is important to not be stupid yourself. Do not believe them. They are never right. Yet every time some of you really god people start to panic about your $500 on there and others with other amounts and you start to waste space and your time talking about if and how you will get your coins back. No one knows anything so it would all be bullshit anyways.<br /><br />Every active member on here has coins on there account. We get it. Some of you are in really bad spots and need that coin. We get it. Just for once in your life take a breath and relax and realize the sun wil rise tomorrow and the ship wil sail again. And you wil find accurate information on this page. As you always have with the KING<br /><br />But to the member that started talking about pgp and that the new and the old shared it and we will not al of you pgp club members have your chance to shine. The one thing we do know for sure is he did not get arrested because of using it and he did not because of not using it.<br /><br />BUT the one thing this proves is that PGP is worthless in signing of messages.as even if a message from DPR was to hit this site now.no one would be able to say for sure it is him. You would be able to confirm it is his pgp.but who cares about that.and this is a reason pgp is useless. But what is more useless is talking about that. I hate PGP. But who the fuck cares. Those guys are my brothers in this fight and my opinion about pgp is the last thing to talk about. SO no more. I only care about getting the best information forward and getting some drugs out in the mail :)<br /><br />Yes the KING is mailing!<br />

				What&#039;s the danger to small time buyers here? If I recall no buyer arrests were made when the farmers market went down and that was with paypal transactions. Is it likely that LE will actually comb the database and hunt down small time buyers (presumably if their address was unencrypted or in a PM)?<br /><br />Plus, what are the feds going to do if they track a buyer down with evidence that he bought drugs if no drugs are found on site? Yeah, he may have bought some drugs a few months ago, but what do they actually have?

				Really stupid question. But have you guys considered &quot;where&quot; this forum is hosted? Since I get error messages showing SR logo when browsing this forum... I don&#039;t want to spread no FUD it&#039;s just something I noticed.

Now you&#039;re thinking like LE. Kinda hard to make a case if you don&#039;t have any physical evidence. You can assume whatever you sent in the clear has been fully compromised and is now in some sort of a permanent government watchlist. That means use alternative drops and names. Obvious and common sense but apparently not nearly common sense enough given how SR was brought down.

				Media is easily manipulated. I mean, if I wanted to run off with tens of millions of your guys money I would probably write a fairly compelling press release as well.

I am not US-based either so risk is reduced a small amount, but the FBI will no doubt share this information with international partners. What exactly would be incriminating evidence on my hard drive apart from Tor browser? Guessing Tor leaves behind &#039;footprints&#039; on the hard drive?

				Exactly. Have the back up planned and prepared so we can all cash out! AHAH don&#039;t let those greedy FEDs get our hard earned money. <br /><br />Note: For vendors, why wasn&#039;t our coins sent to our 3 back-up wallets??? Isn&#039;t that the reason we had that thing, to avoid losing our money? :-( Surely DPR didn&#039;t work alone, where are his friends and mods?<br /><br />If someone does get it up and running and activate the release coins button, that person will be rewarded GREATLY!!
