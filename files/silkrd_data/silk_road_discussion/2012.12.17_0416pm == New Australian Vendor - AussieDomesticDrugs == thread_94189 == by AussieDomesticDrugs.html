				Hey guys, we have just opened for business!<br /><br />AussieDomesticDrugs is a small team of Aussies with high-quality connections now serving the local Australian community at Silk Road.<br /><br />We have been operating successfully for some time IRL, and as there is no-one within Australia currently offering<br />Ecstasy pills, Fantasy (GBL) or Supercoke (MDPV), we have decided to fill the gaps and offer our products here.<br /><br />For our first week of business we will give out a free ecstasy pill with every order!<br /><br />Our plan is to build a business here based on trust, a win/win relationship with our customers and to succeed by offering<br />a superior product at an affordable price.<br /><br />In the future we will have other products available for purchase, including Cocaine.<br /><br />We look forward to your business, and don&#039;t hesitate to contact us with any questions you might have!<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Team A.D.D<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/394e02540d<br />AussieDirect@tormail.org

				AussieDomesticDrgus&#039; current listing for ecstasy pills are not MDMA.&nbsp; I&#039;d read reviews and figured they were MDA.&nbsp; The effects weren&#039;t that pleasant for me.&nbsp; If others have tried it and like it, then buy it - his shipping was quick and he&#039;s giving free gifts at the moment, but if you&#039;re after the sort of euphoria you normally get with MDMA, these won&#039;t do it.<br /><br />To give the guy some credit.. technically, it&#039;s correct to call them ecstasy, and he described them as genuine &quot;MDxx&quot;.&nbsp; Unfortunately, whatever MDxx it was, it just didn&#039;t have that euphora.&nbsp; Only buy it if you&#039;re ok buying MDxx, and don&#039;t buy it if you&#039;re after MDMA.<br /><br />Apologies to the vendor.&nbsp; I gave a 5/5 before anyone had sampled it, but now thinking a slightly negative review is warranted, unless the listing is updated to explicitly state that it&#039;s not MDMA.&nbsp; (Or maybe I&#039;m just a dope - buyers, up to you to make up your mind - just sharing my experience).

				well, at least you sound like a business person who wants to do clean business :) <br /><br />how about including some weed in your offerings? - currently, local weed vendors seem to entirely consist of people with no history or manners that expect everyone to FE and don&#039;t know how to use PGP :( ...<br /><br />can&#039;t complain too much though, in a way they&#039;re making me money; i keep buying BTCs to spend here, end up shaking my head and giving up and watching my unspent BTCs go up and up in value :) going to make some vendor very rich one day lol<br /><br />- (edit) wow, just as i was typing that one of them vanished; wonder how many people got scammed there&nbsp; :-\

				I just made friends with 4 Australians and they were telling me how they have paid anywhere from 40-90 dollars for pills and other such drugs in Australia.&nbsp; I wanna help them out by sending them shipments of goods so they can party for cheap, would it be safer to order from an&nbsp; Aussie vendor?
