				Title: <strong>O/S Ordering Questions</strong><br />

				Don&#039;t know if this is the right place to post this, please move the thread if it is not. <br /><br />I am a new user to the SR and have only made a few purchases domestic and now thinking about making a few purchases O/S as its a fraction of the price and a larger variety. I am concerned about the repercussions if my packages were to get seized as I would be importing amounts over the classed personal amount.<br /><br />1. Where I live in Australia the personal possession for lets say MDMA is 0.75g and anything over that is supply, I would be buying 1-2g O/S. If it was seized would I get a love letter or would it lead to a charge?<br /><br />2. This leads me to my second question I want to buy Gelatin Capsules and Scales would I be safe ordering them in clearnet with my real details or would LE see that as evidence for intent to supply?<br /><br />Not looking at importing large amounts just personal amounts that are still well over the personal amount classification.<br /><br />Any information that can be shared on the matter is welcomed.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />NewspaperBoy

				Depends on the type of scales. Keep them in your kitchen. Lots of people have scales.<br /><br />For the gelatin capsules, do you have any health products you could cap? People do that. You should too. <br /><br />The main thing is not to get caught, I guess. I don&#039;t think there is going to be a big deal over the small amounts you described.

				Thanks I will do what you said and yes I do have some powders that I can say I use the caps for.<br /><br />I will keep it small and see how it goes.
