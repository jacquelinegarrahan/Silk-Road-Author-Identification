				Guys I was on the Road minutes ago doing business. It&#039;s not down just slow as hell. I blame it pn the server overload. There was this hacker post that is starting to make me wonder, but right now it&#039;s everyone&#039;s guess.<br /><br />I do agree the server issue should be fixed asap, downtimes are worrying for both vendors and buyers.<br /><br />Edit: i&#039;m running the Road through my cellphone so it should even be slower than you guys

				I still can&#039;t connect. I was on last night, but right now I am unable to get on. The connection keeps timing out, or else it redirects to www.silkroadvb5piz3r.onion which isn&#039;t a valid hostname.<br /><br />Is it down again or am I broke?<br /><br />Oh, wait, it worked just now, loaded as I was about to press Post; perhaps it&#039;s just being difficult.

				So far so good. I gave it a test once per hour or so since about 4 hours ago and have been able to log in browse a few pages and then log off. <br /><br />Just waiting to see if people report transfers of BTC in/out went without issue. I figure by this weekend all the niggles will be worked out and things will return to normal. Normalish, rather. <br /><br />
