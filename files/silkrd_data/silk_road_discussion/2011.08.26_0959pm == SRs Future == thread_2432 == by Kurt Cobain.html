				Hi,<br /><br />do you think, that there is any way for LE in the future, to force SR to go down? Or will the make BTC illigal? I mean, since media reports about SR, i fell like this won`t last forever.<br /><br />what do you mean?<br /><br />thx

				I think it all depends if they can figure out how to trace the server through Tor. NSA/Homeland Security might be involved if terrorists are using Tor to communicate. If so, Congress has given them unlimited resources to figure it out.

				Unfortunately, Im sure that terrorists are using tor/pgp to communicate. I mean, why wouldnt they? Also, NSA surely can track through Tor. Im sure they have the technology, but if the terrorists kept moving their place of communication, it would be tough for even NSA go get them. I dont know how Tor works.&nbsp; But it seems like if they could make a new onion address every so many days, that they would be tough to track down. But the ironic thing is none of us have any clue on what type of technology the government has in their hands. They may have a program right now that can break any pgp code within minutes.. <br /><br />This is the only bad thing about being anonymous. It attracts the very undesirable..Child porn/terrorists, etc.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about SR future, I think there will be more sites like SR. <br />Tor is pretty safe for current moment, and even more because it&#039;s open source it&#039;s safety can be improved when some flaws will be found.<br />About making BTC illegal, how do you imagine this ?<br />There&#039;re a lot of eMoney now, and to make BTC illegal is to make all those eMoney illegal, which I don&#039;t think will ever happen in near future.

Not just practically, but fundamentally. There were some incidents, when they tried to decrypt truecrypted hard drive for 2 years unsuccessfully. It is all the same asymmetric encryption used in truecrypt and pgp. Even in ideal conditions it will take years to decrypt one single key. <br /><br />As a person who is interested in cypherpunk and technology, I think SR is quite safe not because of TOR or PGP security, but because SR isn&#039;t a site but an idea. And ideas aren&#039;t so easily destroyed. If even tracked, I am sure the servers won&#039;t be that easy to shut down. If shut down, it will restart on another machine. May be other sites will catch the flag and move it on. There is a black market and many others out there. There is i2c, which will help if tor is compromised. Using p2p+smart encryption it is possible to make a decentralized community which will be virtually untraceable. And it is all quite real already, just waiting for a coder to be brought to life. Bitcoin cannot be shut down already. It gathered a critical mass when all the kings horses and all the kings men won&#039;t be able to bring it down. We live in a really interesting times, when the revolution rolls on unnoticed by masses. When it become noticeable, it becomes inevitable. So get ready and fasten your seatbelts. Be proud to be part of it all.<br /><br />Cheers.

				It would be fairly difficult to diminish the SR community. If they find the server(s), what stops the community from pulling up another backup? In that case, they might manage to find some buyers addresses which were unconfirmed and unencrypted, and all the BTC stored in the SR wallets.<br /><br />The community seems strong, so unless a significant amount of people get caught, nothing is stopping people from using multiple proxies, Tor, PGP and bitcoins. There are many other communities which do what we are doing, with much less security. I know of places which operate on IRC, and people feel secure sitting behind a vhost.<br /><br />Although there was some senator who was yelling about getting rid of SR, there are many reasons for LE not to. Since there is no violence involved when purchasing drugs through SR, it makes it much less of a threat to society. Have you ever wandered the streets of NY, London, Rio, Athens etc? Especially the streets where one doesn&#039;t dare to stop at a red light, because someone might break their window and rob them. Why would resources not be spent on cleaning those places up?

A magic formula could be found tomorrow that breaks rjindael or RSA or whatever. There is no way to predict this.<br /><br />That said, breaking algorithms is difficult. It&#039;s far more likely that government agencies would try to find attacks on specific software implementations that we use. No need to beat RSA (thousands of mathematicians have been trying for 30 years now already) if you can find a flaw in GPG that lets you retrieve the plaintext with ease. No need to break any of the cryptography in tor if you can find an flaw that lets you find out users&#039; true IP addresses with ease.<br /><br />And yes the weakest link in all this is ourselves. As I said they cannot (or will not) beat us yet in the electronic realm so they rely largely on social engineering to obtain information and our dependence on the mail system to catch us in the act.

As far as I understand there is no evidence of actual trading. BTC is too slippery to prove it really was payed to the seller for goods. Lawyer&#039;s word needed.

				My TOR hidden node is on a flash drive. I make a clone of it every few weeks and geocache it (Check out the Lexar Echo ZX!). Same thing with my BTC and passwords, etc. All under multiple levels of encryption. I have no reason to think I&#039;m being watched, etc. But I&#039;m prepared. I&#039;m nobody, but that might change. The time to close the barn door is not AFTER the horses get out...<br /><br />Couldn&#039;t SR be re-propagated the same way? Oh noes, they busted the server! Plug in a new flash drive on the other side of the planet, boom, SR is back! Taking down the site is pointless. I&#039;m sure the machine has been traffic analysed already. They know it&#039;s an idea, not a thing. The same applies to the goods sold here... They will attack it the same way, create fear. When you look at how LE operates, that&#039;s all they ever do, it&#039;s all they can do. Create fear of what will be done to you if you don&#039;t obey. There is no chance they can ever take down SR, they can only make you afraid to use it. Just like weed, or meth, or... SR takes away one more tool; the ability to &#039;make a deal if you rat out your supplier.&#039; You don&#039;t know the supplier, so you can&#039;t do it even if you wanted to. So, the only tool they have is fear. You decide if you&#039;re going to succumb to it or not. Period. That&#039;s it. I expect to see them perform a synchronized bust of everyone who has bought from an LE vendor on SR. It&#039;s the only thing they can do. Is the risk of being one of those people larger or smaller than in conventional face-to-face deals? I say smaller. No money, no face-to-face...&nbsp; There are so many elements missing that are usually used in prosecution. How does it tie together? Oh, that tracking number, USPS delivery confirmation. Don&#039;t do business with any vendor who uses tracking numbers. How else do they prove you actually got it? Oh, your feedback... Word it carefully. It is easy to make their job very hard to do on the prosecution side when using SR. You just can&#039;t be a chicken that confesses. They have to be able to prove that you GOT the package they sent. They have to prove they sent you contraband. They have to prove that you paid for it (well, it helps them if they can, possession is still illegal if you paid for it or not). How good does this look for them? When has Government ever been organised enough to pull that off in one synchronised action across the whole country, which they would have to do to make a real press statement out of it? Make a double-edged sword of it by using your brain! Make it hard for them, cover your ass. While dirtbag buyers have caused some vendors to insist on tracking, this is how LE would prove you received it. So don&#039;t use tracking. SR is, hopefully, working on a way to track dirtbag buyers.<br /><br />I see LE having only one option. They&#039;ll sell to and keep track of the users they do business with themselves. This will be but a fraction, but enough to run a &#039;bust&#039; on all of them simultaneously and make a media scene out of it. I don&#039;t see them having a chance to do it any other way, and even this is a stretch for them. If you aren&#039;t a pussy too afraid to fight their charges, you&#039;ll be fine. When they try to spring this trap, having it turn out as a colossal failure when they can&#039;t make charges stick, will be SR&#039;s redemption and final test of success as a model of business and freedom.<br /><br />The down side is that, as in any other method of selling contraband, the persons involved tend not to be educated on their rights and how to exercise them. If you already screwed up, by the time the charges come, there is nothing you can do. Being dumb as a rock has it&#039;s cons.... If you are dumb as a rock and you know it, do something about it. <br /><br />I&#039;ve already identified a couple of well-entrenched vendors that have made statements I would consider giveaways of being LE.<br /><br />Misrepresentation of encryption technologies; stating that they don&#039;t work in a certain way to discourage the use of encryption... Bigtime red flag. I&#039;ll never buy from a vendor that does this.<br /><br />Insisting on a tracking number/delivery confirmation. I&#039;ll never buy from a vendor that does this. That one is a double-edged sword, as I will be a vendor soon myself. I know both parties are suspicious and they want to know what&#039;s going on. The temptation and practicality are hard to hold back. Curiosity killed the cat. A tracking number or delivery confirmation number are the only practical way LE has of saying to a judge &quot;yup, he got the stuff, here&#039;s the proof!&quot; They could also phone up local LEs to watch every address where a teener of pot is being sent... And this isn&#039;t too far-fetched as the point isn&#039;t to bust you for a 1/16th, but to bust 4000 all at once to make a big show and instil fear in the use of SR. It&#039;s the only viable course they could take. So be prepared for it and don&#039;t screw up in advance...&nbsp; The name on the package doesn&#039;t matter if; it was sent to your address, they can prove it was received, and you are in possession of it. Admit to nothing, it won&#039;t help you. You can&#039;t make a plea deal to rat out your supplier, because you don&#039;t know who he is! Exercise your right to remain silent, there is absolutely nothing you can say that will help you, every word will screw you more. Shut your damn mouth!

LE obtains a lot of information in illegal fashions which it cannot use directly to prosecute. BUT, they use that information to set up a separate case.<br /><br />They may not be able to use an address obtained from selling Cocaine to someone in a case against said person for publicity reasons.<br /><br />But, they could still use it, and they definitely WILL use it to watch and set up surveillance and pile together something unrelated to their ill-gotten information.<br /><br />They will make no reference to the REAL initial contact in their prosecution, but will create a viable excuse for the surveillance that no one can prove wrong and any further data or evidence gathered.<br /><br />SR could be used as a focal-point gathering mechanism, as such. Buy from a Fake SR Vendor who is really LE? Get watched until they can build a case unrelated to SR or the fact that SR is where they got your name and address...<br /><br />I venture to say that this is being done as we speak. But that so few SR Vendors are Fakes, they will nab only the dumbest and most careless. As with all else LE does...<br /><br />At $150/Seller Account, and under 200 accounts... That&#039;s not much of a budget! Every SR Vendor could be LE. Hell, maybe SR was set up BY the LE?!!?!?! A po-dunk Police Department spends orders of magnitude more than that just on gas for one Police Car....<br /><br />Teh Paranoidz, dey haz meeee!<br /><br />...but it is entirely possible...&nbsp; Even feasible.
