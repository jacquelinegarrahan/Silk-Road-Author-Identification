			<dd class="postbody">
				UPDATE (05/04/2013 2120 UTC): The site is back up.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to say we are out of the woods yet, but unless something unexpected happens, we should remain up for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />UPDATE (05/05/2013 0100 UTC): We&#039;re still doing battle with this attacker.&nbsp; It seems he has prepared for this for a long time and has many tactics.&nbsp; We continue to use every resource at our disposal to overcome this situation.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience.<br /><br />UPDATE (05/03/2013 0545 UTC): The attacks have been coming non-stop since my last update.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been able to keep the site open more than half the time with only minor issues such as limited image uploading for vendors.&nbsp; Every hour we are making progress and I am feeling much more confident that we will come out on top within the next few days.&nbsp; Still, expect some unannounced down-time here and there.<br /><br />UPDATE (05/01/2013 0238 UTC): Silk Road is open and accessible.&nbsp; As soon as the attacker finds out, he will likely change his tactics and try to take the site down again.&nbsp; Hopefully he won&#039;t be able to, but time will tell.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/30/2013 2022 UTC): Still working on a solution.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t given up hope that we will be able to go forward as a public market without limiting access.&nbsp; We are putting all of our efforts into making that a reality.&nbsp; If that changes, I will let you know here.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/30/2013 0035 UTC): We have come a long way in the battle, but still do not have the upper hand.&nbsp; It&#039;s looking more and more like a restructuring of the tor software or even the tor network will be required to mitigate the kind of attack we are under.&nbsp; If this can be solved by modifying the tor client software running the silk road .onion, then it will be a matter of patching and redeploying the hidden service.&nbsp; If it is a network issue, it will require the cooperation of the Tor developers, or running a new network of nodes.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t given up hope for a faster solution, but if one can not be found, then we will move to a semi private scheme where users will be given access through many private URLs.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep everyone updated on how we will move forward, but please be prepared for a few more days at the least of no access.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/29/2013 0715 UTC): Just want to let you all know I&#039;m still here and we&#039;re still doing battle behind the scenes to get the forums and main site running again.&nbsp; It is incredibly discouraging to have everything we&#039;ve worked so hard for taken down by some anonymous and malevolent person, but your kind words of encouragement do wonders for our moral.&nbsp; We are on the cutting edge of anonymity technology here.&nbsp; The attacks being used against us MUST be overcome if Silk Road and any anonymous public sites are to have a future.&nbsp; Thank you again for your patience with all of this, and pray that we make it through stronger than we started.<br /><br />We are being attacked once more.&nbsp; This time the forums are under attack as well.&nbsp; Access is intermittent, so hopefully some of you can read this.&nbsp; We are doing everything possible to overcome this latest attack.&nbsp; Please be patient while we find a solution.

				To my knowledge maybe im wrong but if its under a DDOS attack, Not just 1 person could do it unless he has a HOIC OR LOIC on several computers firing over and over, and even then iv known hundreds of ppl get together to DDOS a child Porn and it took hours and hundreds of people constantly firing on the site..So my guess its not one person...

				It would be advantageous to have a second back up site. Not so much for the convenience of customers and vendors alike, but a re-direct making the attackers efforts a hopeless waste of time. Business can continue as usual, even if one system goes down. The secondary system should be the latest and the greatest in terms of firewall protection. My tech skills are not at that level, but we all know how many governments want to shut down the road. So the Road is going to require a strategy to survive

				any update DPR? People are saying that a Ddos attack is impossible with Tor, since you have to go through several hops of IP addresses of volunteer servers to connect and the bandwidth is limited. How then could a Ddos attack be so successful? Wouldn&#039;t someone have to attack most every TOR server, in which case, every website running on the TOR network would be clogged up - however, only SR is experiencing the problem, not other onion websites. I was under the impression that you can&#039;t target any one Onion website, since it is impossible to locate the server of any one Onion website. <br />&nbsp; Anyway, I could be wrong, I&#039;m no computer expert. Does anyone who has some more expertise want to chime in?<br />&nbsp;At any rate, but do you have any updates DPR, or any SR admins? All of us vendors have a lot of orders piled up that need to be shipped out, perhaps you can create a non-public mirror Onion address that only the vendors can login to, in order to access our outstanding orders?<br /><br />Thanks for all the hard work, hopefully a solution is found to deal with this problem!<br /><br />QM

				onion.to is a web site that allows people to access hidden tor services *without* using tor.&nbsp; It does this by passing them through a proxy that connects to the tor network.<br /><br />If you access whateversite.onion.to without a tored connection, whoever it is that runs onion.to (apparently someone named XXor) can see your ip.<br /><br />In addition, as far as we understand, going through onion.to allows the people running onion.to to see whatever data (i.e. everything on the page, including usernames, passwords, etc.) is being passed through, regardless of whether your initial connection to them is tored.&nbsp; Think about it this way: if you access facebook over tor, obviously facebook still knows what credentials you&#039;ve logged in with -- they just don&#039;t know your ip.<br /><br />Besides onion.to, there is also tor2web.org and maybe some other sites that do the same thing.&nbsp; Our way of thinking is that these sites are meant for people to be able to casually browse hidden services that contain static data (like leaked documents or something).&nbsp; They protect the web publisher, but not the web browser.&nbsp; And so they are definitely *not* meant for doing things like conducting business on SR.<br /><br />And as for the government taking Sunday off, we weren&#039;t aware that we get a reprieve from police arrests or military bombings on the weekend.<br /><br />tl;dr: Scout is 100% right.<br /><br />P.S. DPR, keep on keeping on!

				I still fail to see how a Ddos attack on a specific .onion site is even possible without knowing the specific server&#039;s location. Does this mean that someone has figured out where SR&#039;s servers are located? Bandwidth is limited for the Tor server volunteers, correct? Wouldn&#039;t an overload of data just make you lose connectivity with the Tor servers you are connected to? Am I wrong?

				Getting sick of these dirty rat dog ddos&#039;ers. I think it must be a government somewhere because the whole bitcoin network has been getting hit by ddos attacks for a while now.All it&#039;s going to do though is point out weak points so we can work around them. <br /><br />Thanks DPR and team keep fighting these rats off for us. you guys are legends!<br />&nbsp;

I hate to speak in absolutes, but basically it&#039;s just not possible.<br /><br />So that&#039;s why everyone goes around saying you can&#039;t do distributed denial of service attacks via Tor.&nbsp; Because classically speaking, you can&#039;t.&nbsp; But a denial of service denies access to a given service.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about you guys, but I&#039;m sure as Hell being denied access to SR&#039;s forums.&nbsp; It also doesn&#039;t seem to have anything at all to do with the Tor network.&nbsp; The servers themselves are being (almost) crippled by a means other than what people usually are talking about when they say DDoS.<br /><br />If you&#039;re really curious what may be going on, you can check out http://mixedbit.org/blog/2013/04/11/dos_attack_on_cdn_users.html -- I don&#039;t know that it has anything to do with anything here, but it may give you a better idea how a DoS can be done even with Tor.&nbsp; Or it may just confuse you more, I dunno... either way, there ya go.<br /><br />By the way, I&#039;ve been on the main Silk Road sight all night.&nbsp; Frankly I don&#039;t know what you guys are talking about, SR has been working just fine for me.&nbsp; The forums on the other hand......

As far as losing users and vendors, i&#039;m personally fine with that. I believe that if these users/vendors are leaving because a couple of days of downtime, they should. This is a BLACK MARKET. People don&#039;t seem to understand that, they look at SR as an ebay for drugs and expect to get the same security that sites like ebay have to offer. This is not the case. Most vendors are here because they are well educated individuals that have products people want to buy at an amount where they see fit for running their operations. When they bought their vendor accounts, i&#039;m pretty sure they thought of the possibility that SR will be going down for certain amounts of time. Like I said earlier, this is a BLACK MARKET, at the end of the day there is no security. If DPR wanted to flip and give all the information he or she has possession of, to LE, DPR could (just something to think about). I have faith in DPR, and everyone else should too. I see there&#039;s a lot of negativity in this thread right now regarding SR going down for good, don&#039;t think like that, negative vibes only bring negative things. Be thankful we have someone working so hard just to make sure that we can get our drugs safely. <br /><br />Anyways, keep on fighting the good fight DPR! You truly are an inspiration to me as well as many others on and off the roads. Keep your head up, it&#039;s not a matter of IF you stop the attack, it&#039;s a matter of WHEN you stop the attack.<br /><br />I enjoyed this little rant hahah alright goodnight world.<br /><br />Peace,<br />STfish

				Hey guys, so is no-one able to get on right now? I can&#039;t get past the privoxy error screen and sometimes this is just linux or the network I guess, other times the road is down big time. I see this thread is up so I&#039;m guessing on this occasion it&#039;s just down.<br />Shame it&#039;s been down so much lately, definitely caused a few disruptions to my usual business on the road but hey, I can kick back and relax for now with the perfect excuse.<br />DPR, love is with you and we support your every move, let&#039;s hope that this just makes the road a stronger and impenetrable fort for future attacks (wouldn&#039;t mind a bit more loading speed either haha).<br /><br />Anyway, good luck to everyone, admin, vendors and buyers.<br /><br />Thanks for all your work guys

				Looks like somebody has control of several nodes and is just replaying shit back at everybody. I just did a few tcp dumps and it looks as soon as SR starts to download I get garbage from somewhere else. Tor says fuck this don&#039;t look right, drops the connection and tries again.

				I have had no issues with the forums at all this morning. However, the main site is snafu atm for me still. I gave up clicking on the main site for the rest of the morning. I&#039;m going to let DPR and his crew do what they do and I&#039;ll click more later. <br /><br />This site is one the most amazing things I have been a part of. I feel very fortunate too be able to take part in it. Thank you DPR and all those who make this possible and thank you for your diligence in trying to keep it running smoothly.&nbsp; It cannot be easy with so many wolves trying to get to the flock.

				I can&#039;t get on yet, but I love seeing that people are getting back on! I have a huge amount of orders to fill, for all my customers who are waiting, thank you for your patience, see my feedback thread for updates on when your order will ship: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30964.msg347996#msg347996<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you will read my post DPR, but if you do...<br /><br />I read something DPR said, that was in that Forbes article of all his quotes, that resonated with me. DPR said &quot;I’m out to turn unconscious agorists into conscious active ones&quot;...<br /><br />Well consider me an unconscious agorist turned into conscious active one. I couldn&#039;t agree with DPR more on almost everything he stands for. SR is about personal liberty and every single transaction made on SR is one more step taken for our God-given freedom to do what we want with ourselves as free human beings, because it is a step taken that the State had no control over. Being one of the top vendors here, I don&#039;t take my responsibility as a vendor lightly on SR, I know I&#039;m part of something big, all the DDOS attacks in the World won&#039;t stop.<br /><br />Thanks DPR for fighting the good fight, and know we&#039;re all here backing you up. Maybe someday, when the World is different, we can meet under different circumstances and have a few beers and a few laughs...<br /><br />...maybe.<br /><br />QM<br /><br />

				The quotes I use in my signature are more than just ripping some cool sounding shit off - I believe this is the way I, and many I know - personally IRL and anonymously thru SR - live their lives.<br /><br />Is this the fight we&#039;ve been anticipating?&nbsp; Is this hacktivism or State (and I mean US State) attempted intervention?&nbsp; How long can a cyber-fight last?<br /><br />But we&#039;ll win - there&#039;s too many of us.&nbsp; DPR is DPR (for now) - but if you know you&#039;re Princess Bride, we&#039;re all DPR (or have the capacity to be; or Spartacus, same idea different era) - it&#039;ll transfer on and on and on and on...(end of V for Vendetta anyone?)<br /><br />So tell us what we need to do DPR and SR admin - you have an army of cryptoanarchists (with varying levels of ability) - and a customer-base only too willing to learn how to raise the game.&nbsp; We are a decentralized community so we are perfectly capable of organising ourselves, but we need some guidance as to what the Community needs done.&nbsp; Could we be DDOSing an identified target to fuck it up in return?&nbsp; Can we create mirror or alternate tor addresses for situations like this, as a previous poster has suggested?<br /><br />But basically - HOW CAN WE HELP?&nbsp; Or can&#039;t we?<br /><br />We do this together our community gets stronger - we cannot turn away.&nbsp; We walk together - unido.<br />

The most probable thing is that nobody here will ever find out who is attacking the Silkroad so leave it be, forget about revenge, it brings nothing good to our image and will do more harm than good and will serve as an excuse for future attacks, which will take the site down for even more time.<br /><br />We should focus on defense rather than an unfruitful knee-jerk reaction. I don&#039;t really know how DPR set up his servers but if I were to DoS/DDoS attack the Silkroad, I&#039;d focus on successive HTTP GET/POST requests to the Silkroad server.<br />Contrary to what many people stated, servers behind tor are susceptible to these attacks and it&#039;s something very easy to perform. For example, if you download the same file over and over from Silkroad, you will hog the server&#039;s bandwidth the same way you could do it any other site on the internet.<br />And there&#039;s another problem for Silkroad being behind Tor: It cannot ban the flooders by IP address, since there are no IP address identifying anyone here; so Silkroad servers sits there helplessly waiting for the flood to stop.<br /><br />A DDoS can not only work by hogging the server&#039;s bandwidth but it can also hog the Servers&#039; RAM or CPU by forcing it to perform heavy operations. It could be by calling some PHP script on the road that perform some long operation on the database; while a normal user wouldn&#039;t be able to notice which operations take more or less time, a determined attacker could guess by statistical analysis how many time does it take to execute each operation and exploit it in order to put the CPUs or RAM under heavy load. If successful, the attacker <br /><br />Of course most of these intensive scripts can only be ran after logging in, and you need to solve a captcha to login in but I can assure you that I would be able to make a program that breaks it very easily and I ain&#039;t no expert in solving captchas or anything like that. I&#039;d advise you to change it as soon as you can.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t mean that the Silkroad was broken, at all. I&#039;d be pretty confident that DPR did a good job regarding the users confidentiality. Don&#039;t worry because DDoS are the lowest of the lowest kind of &quot;hacker&quot; attacks. It&#039;s the desperate cry of someone who could do nothing better to break a system, like the cry of a baby who was denied some candy. Every system is susceptible to DDoS attacks!<br /><br />Another idea that I&#039;d like to leave, and that I&#039;m assuming you have physical access to the SR servers, is that if you don&#039;t have logs of your system, you could build a one-way ethernet cable from the SR server to a Log server that would only allow you to write to the Log server, and never read. That would make impossible even for the leetest hacker in the world to read the logs from a remote source.<br />This way you would be able to inspect the nature of future attacks and don&#039;t open any hole in your system.<br />You could add an extra layer of security by encrypting the logs in the Log server.<br /><br />Have fun!

				What I hate most here is that there&#039;s no people with IT knowledge to explain other people about DDoS attack and make them calm and waiting. I see here only people who love or hate what staff is doing. I read only 2 posts which told me something more about what&#039;s going on and that we really can&#039;t protect from attack but I&#039;d like to hear some ideas about security levels to make myself confident that we are safe and unable to catch because despite of I know that it&#039;s only DDoS I don&#039;t feel 100% sure that I&#039;m safe. <br />I feel 95% safe due to I see that service like this has never been intercepted by Law Enforcement in hacking way. Farmers Market has been shut down because guys offered too many ways of payment like Western Union, Paypal etc. + communication has been supported by Hushmail which is not totally anonymous so they caught them in classic methods of interception like tracing payments or reading their letters.<br />I hope that everything will be fixed soon and few words to people are talking about proxy websites like onion.to and they say it&#039;s risky. It&#039;s risky only from this side that your ISP will see what adress you enter but all communication from entrance node through relay nodes to exit nodes and then to server is encrypted so it&#039;s 100% safe. You don&#039;t have to even worry if LE close website due to they will only receive encrypted packages of data which has to be cracked to see what does it contain and TOR nodes don&#039;t remember what they received and what they sent so it&#039;s really safe system. Weakness part of TOR is logg in to clearnet websites because exit node can be listened and they can intercept packages from exit nodes and decrypt it but only if connection is not encrypted.

				Thanks for the info, but I just read a post from you that you previously said Silkroad was stronger then ever because of the original attack and because of those changes and work you have done it would be very difficult to take Silkroad down again. I&#039;m confused? Maybe you guys need to hire a professional who can deal with security breaches and things like this. Taking help from the &quot;community&quot; isn&#039;t going to cut it anymore. <br /><br />I&#039;m also keen to believe that some kind of law enforcement is behind this, trying to extract as much information as possible. The best way to accumulate information is when there is chaos and issues, because someone can slip in and out easily without being noticed. I suggest to completely shut down until a more secure site can be built. Do I want that to happen right now? Hell no. I have a ton of money in my account that I can&#039;t get to and may not be able to access it for a long time if ever. Nothing we can do besides hope you make the best decision(s) for everyone and hopefully get the site back up and running.<br /><br />Use some of those thousands and thousands of dollars you guys made on commissions and get some real security protection for us all. :)<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				This is great news.&nbsp; It will be so much faster semi private. <br />It&#039;s fast to do.&nbsp; a few days maybe. <br /><br />The worst part is that newbies can&#039;t find the site.&nbsp; But everyone else with an account already will be able to get in. <br /><br />Links can be updated to the site.

				Tor is fucked.

				even if LE manages to shut down SR, vendors would simply move to another site. The government may win this battle, but they will still lose the war. On another note, what does it mean when the site is &quot;semi-private?&quot; does that mean that the URL will change, or that only people who are currently members will be able to use the site? I&#039;ve been here for almost 8 months so i feel that hopefully i&#039;ll be invited to join the new SR if it comes down to that

I just really hope my customer&#039;s are aware of this and realize I&#039;m unable to process anything or help them in anyway. DPR said the site would be more resilient from the work they did because of the attack a few days ago. What happened with that?<br /><br />To all the customer&#039;s out there, please give your vendors a break here. We are unable to do anything or help you anyway.

				It doesn&#039;t make any sense for anyone to be attacking SR other than LE.<br /><br />As the use and value of BTC increases, those with the most capabilities to earn BTC in a highly demanded market will emerge as the new power players of this rapidly evolving world. It may be because of this that LE is deciding to remove the pawns from the chessboard before they promote themselves into queens. <br /><br />I trust DPR in choosing the best course of action concerning the future of SR. Whatever doesn&#039;t kill you makes you stronger, and Silk Road will never die!<br /><br />

				I doubt that in days there will be patches available for the tor network. Afaik these kind of attacks dont exist since some weeks, they have allready been discussed in 2008.<br />For the other techies in here that want to learn more about possible attacks on the tor network, scroll to chapter 7:<br />Warning Clearnet Link!: https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/design-paper/tor-design.html<br /><br />Thinking about clearnet links, i hope you have a very very secure hoster that protects your personal information. Something like cyberbunker.<br /><br />Its difficult tough to give advice as DPR doesnt really sayed much about the actual type of attack, but i would guess they are attackin rendezvous/introduction points.<br /><br />Best Regards<br />too sober gerstoner

				I&#039;m not one to point fingers, but the most logical reason for this attack is that it&#039;s being funded by Atlantis. What better way to get people to transfer markets then not even being able to use your current market. In fact, if the source was a bet at a casino, I&#039;d empty my bank account and re mortgage my house on them being responsible for it, most likely by paying multiple people to lay it on SR with everything they got.<br /><br />In a sense it&#039;s smart business investment on their part, that could very well work. The unfortunate part about it is that their really isn&#039;t anything you can do about it but fight it out until someone gives up.

				Honestly, the worst part of SR being down is that I don&#039;t know if some vendors got my orders that I sent almost immediately before it went fully down. But I&#039;ll find out when they come in the mail. Oh, and I don&#039;t have my drug porn, but that&#039;s probably a good thing. :D

				No need to panic. DPR will come through with a solution like always, and even if it may be down for a few days it will be back up eventually some how no matter what. hopefully most vendors will honor their orders that they were able to get prepared&nbsp; for shipping&nbsp; before the server went down and things will be finalized in a few days when things are back to normal.

The last article contains a post by the author of pyLoris that describes his recommendations for mitigating DOS from pyLoris and Tor in general. I hope one of these helps. I will be doing as much research as I can to help find a solution.<br /><br />hxxp://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.3863.pdf<br /><br />&quot;Anonymous communication systems are subject to selective denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Selective DoS attacks lower anonymity as they force paths to be rebuilt multiple times to ensure delivery which increases the opportunity for more attack. In this paper we present a detection algorithm that filters out compromised communication channels for one of the anonymity networks, Tor. Our detection algorithm uses two levels of probing to filter out potentially com-promised tunnels. We perform probabilistic analysis and extensive simulation to<br />show the robustness of our detection algorithm. We also analyze the overhead of our detection algorithm and show that we can achieve satisfactory security guar-antee for reasonable communication overhead (~5% of the total available Tor bandwidth). Real world experiments reveal that our detection algorithm provides good defense against selective DoS attack.&quot;<br /><br />hxxp://fc09.ifca.ai/papers/43_Detecting_dos_in_tor.pdf<br /><br />&quot;More recently, Borisov et al. [3] showed that an adversary willing to engage in denial of service (DoS) could increase their probability of compromising anonymity. When a path is<br />reconstructed after a denial of service, new proxies are chosen, and thus the adversary has another chance to be on the endpoints of the path. Our contributions are as follows. We prove that an adversary engaging in the DoS attack in an idealized Tor-like system can be detected by probing at most 3n paths in the system, where n is the number of proxies in the system. Through simulation, we show that an adversary attempting to avoid detection by engaging in DoS probabilistically can still be detected, and that the attempt to avoid detection radically degrades the effectiveness of the attack. Finally, using measurements of connection drop rates across Tor nodes, we implement a version of the detection algorithm and conclude it is unlikely that such an attack was in progress during the time period the network was observed.&quot;<br /><br />hxxp://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19698/mitigating-anonymous-dos-tor-combined-with-pyloris<br /><br />&quot;sarepta: To start off, I am the author of PyLoris, so I have done a good amount of research into this. In fact, the attack you have envisioned is one that I specifically coded to when developing PyLoris--the current version even comes bundled with an helper app tor_switcher.py which routes the attack through multiple Tor exit nodes.<br /><br />The only good way of detecting a Tor-based flood is by checking source IP addresses against known Tor exit nodes. This is trivial with blacklisting or plugins like mod_security. In my research, mod_antilors does not prevent the PyLoris+Tor vector as it is IP address based. My personal choice for preventing this attack is to use any server other than Apache to handle direct connections from the internet. This could mean using a reverse proxy like Varnish to marshal requests or switching to something like nginx for your web server.<br /><br />Aside from rethinking your infrastructure, I do feel that a combination of low timeouts, IP connection limits, minimum data transfer rates, maximum connection time limits, and maximum request sizes can provide adequate protection from this form of attack. I say this all with the disclaimer that there is no way to prevent this form of attack, and that these configurations should be thought through thoroughly to gauge their impact on a per-server basis.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />please shut up

				It&#039;s interesting to look at Atlas - some of the highest bandwidth TOR nodes online right now all show a burst in traffic starting just about when the most recent DOS started.<br /><br />These nodes in particular:<br />https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/80F870DD215A0C56005266A71C46F92F39F1973B<br />https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/0ECBAB33DD27A6DA5C1141B39F839F931F92334C<br />https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/D0236B1908B3CC686DB0A361F4931073A25793F1<br />https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/43691853EA556C21A77E006886A5DC579855F527<br /><br />It could be that these in particular are listed among the highest bandwidth nodes currently simply because they&#039;re being used to pass on DOS traffic to SR, but they certainly show a traffic pattern not visible on the other high bandwidth nodes, and between them they&#039;re topping a gigabit in traffic...

				I wouldn&#039;t mind getting my funds back, either. I am not desperate and it isn&#039;t a lot of BTC, but still it would reassure me that the feature for getting back my BTC actually works. If the feature is only supposed to work when Law Enforcement capture the servers, then it will be too late. <br /><br />In my opinion, BTC should be returned if SR is down for more than 3 days.

				Hello Admin/DRP,<br /><br />I have suggested to you many times and long ago to make the forum visible by members only (after login), and possibly 1 account per SR main account to forum account Anyway now it&#039;s too late. It seems you did not give importance to that and SR is infamous all over the news and web, LE, anonymous hackers and anyone can easily read your updates or spread all over the open web even more and attack your servers repeatedly, even used to performing SQL injections. Do you bother to read members&#039; precious feedback in the feature request?<br /><br />You did not hide the forum&nbsp; from reporters, journalists and LE because you wanted to &#039;boost&#039; the popularity and sales volume, now, it has the price to be paid.<br /><br />Please, it&#039;s time to take into real consideration members&#039; precious suggestion than to do things your own way.<br /><br />I am just curious, have you ever seriously taken the advices from your loyal members?<br /><br />Also, seriously, you are putting the blame of DDoS attack to Tor&#039;s network?

Also, friendly advice, the 3 business day turn around sounds like the destination is sold in an open market then moved to an account. Some very reliable (Mama Bear and such, I can get names bur as always I advise your own research) could do a MoneyPac code. I have had same day turn around, then covert to a money order or cashiers check. <br /><br />Best wishes bro! As for the road, I said last night &quot;I have not been this low on herb in so long, I miss my road&quot; lol.

				Hey guys/gals - QM here, I&#039;m one of the largest vendors on SR. all of you who need Benzos, Soma, and Tramadol, don&#039;t fret - I am going to open my store on BMR starting tonight. I know my customers are in need, not being able to get their orders. I&#039;m assuming that my pending orders are going to be cancelled, with the latest DPR update - and it seems we won&#039;t have SR back for at least this week. I&#039;m staying loyal to SR - as soon as SR opens again, I&#039;ll be back here and off BMR. But until then, my customers need their meds so I&#039;ll be over on BMR. Again, I&#039;m staying loyal to SR, as soon as SR opens again, I&#039;ll be back here. Any other vendors think this is a good idea? BMR now, once SR is back, I&#039;ll pull my BMR listings.<br /><br />I am kind of short on benzos at the moment, I&#039;ll have limited stock, but I do have a lot of Tramadol and Soma, in my experience, all of you who are on oxy or other opiates, tramadol is great for mitigating withdrawals. I&#039;m reading all these posts of people going through withdrawals and not being able to go to work, and I have plenty of Tramadol to help with that. I&#039;ll be on BMR if you need it. Look for me in about 12 hours there...<br /><br />QM

				Well, I’ve hit Jr Forum member status, so I thought I would celebrate with a big fuck off TLDR stating some of my thoughts about my life and the road.

				I was also thinking of putting my listings up on BMR JUST until the road is up just in case there are lots of people that are in need of ordering Xanax powder from me.....feel free to contact me here on the forums or tormail anyone! All orders that were marked in transit have been shipped. I do not think I am going to make an account on BMR....it just seems wrong to be &quot;cheating&quot; :P on the road haha. I have lots of faith in DPR fixing this issue and we can still conduct business without registering on a &quot;rival&quot; site... BUT I won&#039;t lie that it has crossed my mind because at least they have an escrow service over there and its not like its expensive to put listings up on BMR.....Do a lot of people go over there when the road is down? Because it being down this often actually REALLY cuts into sales badly, so I have seriously been considering putting listings up on BMR. What does the community think? I personally am just hoping this attack is over with soon! I will ALWAYS be loyal to the road over ANY other place. I love it here, but also think it might be a good idea to have backup listings on BMR JUST for when the road is down? Let me know what you guys think :)

				I’m not a vendor, but again I might as well convey some of my thoughts. <br />The idea of not going to BMR out of loyalty seems a little absurd to me. I mean why not?&nbsp; The reason I think many don’t is because BMR is a bit shit. BMR to me seems a more risky endeavour for a buyer and a vendor – again this is purely based on my own feelings, based on the listing I’ve seen over there. <br />Although, I have conducted some very small transactions over there and it went without any problems – I just think a lot more diligence and security is needed. <br /><br />IMO SR shits all over BMR but there&#039;s no reason not to use it if it&#039;s going to increase your revenue flow<br />

Some people just want to watch the world burn! <br /><br />Hope you guys get it sorted soon, if we as a team can over come this then there&#039;s a bright future ahead for SR. Its nice to see people trying to offer help to the sr staff, shows that people are here for good and not just to get what drugs they want and move on, everyone wants this site to work and do well, that way everyone is a winner, the owners make there money, the venders get there money, and the customers get good quality product!<br /><br />Hope to see that Home Page soon!

				I&#039;ve been silent on the forums for months because I had nothing of note to say. I still felt that way until I saw people opening saying they were giving ANY business to BMR.

				Yeah I signed up for BMR and the site really has nothing, it seems really shady, a poor copy of the road at best.<br /><br />I went back on there today and every vendor selling is like well I know you SR refugee&#039;s are here so your welcome to order from me...<br /><br />It does suck though, where I live now you can&#039;t even buy alcohol, its crazy...

				Hello Everybody,<br /><br /><br />We are working on SR for longer than a year now and the site went down for 5-7days a few months ago and came back up and running even better then before.<br /><br />Everybody wants SR to run smooth both buyers and sellers and therefor we have to give the whole Sr staff the time that they need to secure and renew the site whenever necessary. <br />Keep in mind that they are also losing money every day that SR is offline and people cant access there accounts, so they will do everything in there power and even beyond that to get SR up and running again ASAP.<br /><br />i don&#039;t have a good view on the other markets that are operating but my advice to everybody that&#039;s been messaging me about going to other markets is to wait until SR is back up and have faith in the community.<br />Because going to a different market will not mean that it will not have the same problems. (The Grass Looks Always Greener At The Neighbors)<br /><br /><br />There is a holiday at the moment in Holland so not one vendor from NL can ship packages today.<br /><br /><br />The BTC price is fluctuating strong at the moment and is very vulnerable.<br />Some people are loosing money the same hour that they bought Btc and others are making profit.<br /><br />For all the people that lost a lot of money in the last few days or weeks, there is going to be a compensating in the form of discount on most of our listings for at least 2 weeks so that everybody can smile again.<br />When SR is online there will be more info about the discounts.<br /><br /><br />Too all the SR members from USA and AU we will switch all of our listing from europion union to shipping worldwide in 1-2week give us some time to adjust a few things to operate successful thru the account c63amg because working with a second account and more people can cause a lot of headache. That&#039;s why we closed cls63amg and will operate worldwide thru c63amg in 1-2weeks so that we have everything in our own hands. There will be free samples shipped out when we our ready to ship worldwide to test the packages stealth and to let everybody sample our products.<br /><br /><br />Hoping that we informed everybody enough.<br />lets all pray and wait till SR is online again so that everything turns to normal again.<br /><br /><br /><br />For all soccer lovers or people that just like to win something, there is a champions league game tonight between<br />Real Madrid - FSB Dortmund <br /><br />The first person that can guess the final score correct will get a gift coupon of 100USD that they can exchange in our shop only.<br /><br /><br />Here is the link for the thread to put your final score: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153596.0<br /><br /><br /><br />Type your winning score in the form as written below<br />for example:&nbsp; Real Madrid - FSB Dortmund 2-3<br /><br /><br />Be quick cause we will not accept scores after the first half of the match.<br />And the first person that got the score correct will get the coupon.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />c63amg<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />

				From my understanding Tor has always been at risk of DoS&#039;ing of hidden services as its impossible to determine legitimate traffic from from malicious due to the anonymous nature of Tor.<br /><br />The ultimate solution would be to install more hardware and entry points to meet the increased demand for bandwidth and server power, however if it&#039;s a DDoS attack from a botnet, its unlikely that would help as no amount of bandwidth will cut it.<br /><br />If it is a DDoS, which seems the most likely, the perpetrators won&#039;t be able to keep it up forever. Paying for use of a botnet isn&#039;t exactly cheap.<br /><br />Another solution, which DPR mentioned is using multiple urls, this seems like the best option to me. Rotate new urls repeatedly and the botnet won&#039;t keep up. The difficulty is issuing those urls to users, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a solution there somewhere but it needs some thinking outside the box.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153045.msg1069342#msg1069342">Quote from: commodore64 on April 30, 2013, 05:50 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153045.msg1069265#msg1069265">Quote from: Secret_Squirrel on April 30, 2013, 05:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Yeah I was just thinking how hard it must be to troubleshoot this when you have a ton of users trying to get on. <br /><br />Everyone should probably check the forums instead of loading SR every few seconds.&nbsp; Someone will eventually say &quot;I GOT IN!&quot;...everyone who saw that and thought I got in I apologize I have not, it was just an example...dont hate me lol<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I want to be that person<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I kept trying and did eventually get through,&nbsp; but SR is in maintenance mode and you will see an error page instead of a login.<br /><br />Keep up the good work DPR, you&#039;ll get there in the end.

				At this point--no one should be hitting refresh or trying to get to SR more than 2 or 3 times a day.&nbsp; It&#039;s clear that the DDoS attack is ongoing and with hundreds (or thousands) of users pinging the site continuously the problem is only compounding.<br /><br />Working around this issue takes time.&nbsp; If the admins had a solution up their sleeve, we wouldn&#039;t have any downtime.&nbsp; But be patient and be realistic--DPR &#039;n &#039;em aren&#039;t just going to throw the towel in and end SR forever.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Relax and wait it out (unless you are getting dopesick, in which case, just wait it out :-/ )

Things are so serious? i really hope this is not the end of SR, and in one way or another we will be able to browse to that paradise market again.<br /><br />it would be good to have more info such as the maximum deadline you &quot;think&quot;&nbsp; until having SR running, but as always its good just to hear any words from you DPR

				last year the outage was for about a week. i recall DPR giving access to vendors for a few days so all vendors could sort things out, i wish he would do that right now! until then we wait.......we have a fair amount tied up in escrow but i can only imagine the bigtime vendors... if i had 20k$ in escrow i would be concerned

				BMR has a certification process to verify if the same username vendor is the same on BMR and SR by sending a PM via BMR, they then send another PM with code via SR and you get certified on BMR with a mark on your user name in your profile at BMR.<br /><br />This of course, means that BMR has been working in concert with Silk Road to verify that vendors who say they are the same, actually are the same. I did this, and you can see my verification icon at BMR, link in sig<br /><br />They are doing this now because many vendors who got banned became a vendor under another name of a vendor who was still legit here. So basically both BMR and SR teamed up to help cut down on fraud<br /><br />I started out at BMR because I could not afford to become a vendor here until another vendor lent me 5BTC so I could come here. I paid him back in 10 days flat after coming here. There maybe have been and maybe still are scammers at BMR, but they have been banning vendors over there, but it&#039;s also a very tiny traffic site compared with SR<br /><br />But there are some who are on both site and have been verified using a special SR account set up for this. It also means it&#039;s highly unlikely the attacks are coming from people at BMR since they have already been working together in at least this small way<br /><br />Apparently this is not widely known, although there are threads at BMR about it. You can see the little green camel underneath my&nbsp; profile icon at BMR here<br /><br />http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php?p=viewUser&amp;id=166446<br /><br />Here is the announcement of this feature on BMR forums<br /><br />http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewtopic.php?id=2785<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153045.msg1069962#msg1069962">Quote from: godofall2 on April 30, 2013, 08:46 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">remember everyone just because someone has same username on BMR or atlanis dose not mean there the same as on SR. i got my username for atlanis but not for BMR so if you see someone selling under godofall on BMR it not me. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Realistically what you guys have managed to accomplish is historical and groundbreaking. I envy you guys for the change you have done to the world. And i have never met a nicer group of individuals then the SR community. I know my support means minimal in the grand scope, but you deserve acknowledgment of your accomplishment and a show of support from those who believe in the you and the foundation you&#039;ve laid.

				I understand the frustration to work like crazy on this but I have to say that attacks like these are pushing SR security in the right direction (I hope).. I understand that many are on their watch as they are living on the border without water, toilets and grocery stores.. <br /><br />There&#039;s only one possible profession for someone living out there in the frigging dessert...

				I posted this as it&#039;s own topic but I&#039;d be interested on some more feedback<br /><br />I know some of us have the emails to vendors we&#039;ve worked with for a while but what if the forums go down again with the road? Twas a pretty dark time earlier. As well, a lot of the vendors utilize tormail for their non SR communication and it seems over the last month that tormail has become increasing spotty in service, with it going back down today.<br /><br />Thought/ ideas anybody?<br /><br />I think more people should move to a clearnet email account entirely created and only accessed through tor, that mixed with PGP seems, to my limited knowledge, a decent way of anonymous and reliable communication.<br /><br />I really wish and hope that either vendors will come together or someone will make a thread similar to the PGP public key one with vendor info on it while the forums are still up.<br /><br />If the forums go down again, the majority of us on here are fucked and will be completely out of the loop.<br /><br />This community is something we&#039;ve all worked too hard for and it is unreasonable to tie our existence as a community, revolution, and idea simply to two .onion sites.<br /><br />We need back up, we need other solutions, and we need them now.<br /><br /><br />We&#039;re (collectively) an intelligent bunch, we should be able to think of something.

				I have been a long time fan of SR, and honestly I plan to stick around but when is enough, enough. I am 100% with DPR and him fixing this, but for some reason this time it just seems like they cannot get a grip on it. I mean we have experienced many outages, and bad site availability and we have all put up with it.... DPR is such a smart dude, I just dont understand why he cant put a block on this. I am no tech wiz, but I know many of us have thousands and thousands at risk here. I hope at least if they shut down we can get our coinage back and such. I am rooting for you, but I also think there are somethings you are not telling us... Please just be honest to all of us who have been faithful to you, and have put a great deal of money in your pocket. I mean the loses from this could be in the millions. I dont know, sorry for venting and I dont mean to complain. All I want to see is the site back up and this hacking crap done with. I mean if they have been able to stay open this long, then why didnt anyone do this before, could it be an exit strategy for the company? I dont know, and its not likely I just think this is the worst we have seen in a long time and it bothers me now that this Atlantis site just pops up and now vendors and buyers are going to this site to do business. I mean, is it a coincidence, someone has to to atleast look into this.&nbsp; Best of luck DPR and if you happen to read this, maybe you can explain to us what the worst case scenario is. Most business people have to plan for the worst and hope for the best. Has everything been saved to where you can roll back the server to know who had what money in what account. I dont know, just thinking...

				its working but what dpr said is discouraging it may go down again soon<br /><br />edit: I have several orders that are now marked as &#039;late&#039; I am going to send individual messages to this members but I&#039;m just wondering, when auto finalize is disabled is the 4 day period from order to marked in transit not disabled as well? These orders are from after midday friday, therefore would not have been shipped until monday AM.

				It&#039;s hard to say for sure right now whether the site is under attack again, as I can sort of navigate the site if I wait a long time and refresh each page a few times, it could just be busy with users right now. I wonder if any of my orders got shipped in the brief window when the site worked?&nbsp; If any of my orders shipped I hope I can finalize in a timely fashion when they arrive.

				Couldn&#039;t get on again for ages and then got in.<br /><br />I have no understanding of all this DoSing shit, but I suspect it&#039;s being attacked again rather than just lots of traffic.

Then completely down.<br /><br />That said, it&#039;s running smoothly for me right now. Fast loading.

				I&#039;m also only having intermittent access to SR. I&#039;m really starting to believe that these attacks do originate from Atlantis. Moreover I&#039;m also quite certain the attacker is not going to stop. If he breaks through again with the next couple of hours or days so that SR is closed AGAIN for a day or 2, vendors and buys certainly will go to Atlantis just because everyone here wants drugs or wants to make money.&nbsp; It looks all so simple, because as long as SR exists and functions well, there&#039;s totally no need to go to Atlantis. Why would you since all vendors and buyers are here. <br />However I do hope that DPR finds a permanent solution this al qaeda piece of shit

				Atlantis is certainly the most obvious suspect, but even that theory seems problematic to me. Apparently while the site is really smooth and awesome for buyers (functionality-wise, not community or anything else-wise), it&#039;s actually massively time-consuming for vendors. That&#039;s the reason JOR gave for their plan to move FROM atlantis onto BMR, should problems here persist.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m being naive and looking for holes in the theory, but if people are right in thinking that this attack is pretty unique and being carried out extremely effectively, and was planned for weeks and weeks if not more... Wouldn&#039;t they have made Atlantis truly fucking awesome as well, so that people pick it over BMR? Again, no idea about this DoSing shit, but my instincts are that whoever is capable of carrying out such a thing, is more than capable of setting up a site that functions as well as the silk road for vendors. If I was willing to go to such lengths to ruin the competition, I&#039;d make sure my site was untouchable beforehand, especially when BMR exists...<br /><br />Just some thoughts. I don&#039;t know shit.

				I think it says a lot about the community as a whole that so many of us are panicking about being able to finalize our orders. It&#039;s not the vendors panicking that they want the customers to finalize, it&#039;s the vendors worrying about getting orders out and customers worrying about finalizing in a timely manner. <br /><br />Thanks for the hard work DPR/team!!

				I think the issue is from everyone trying to access the login page at once, it&#039;s overloading that page with requests. Once you are able to get in, the site runs fast and without any issues. Be patient, the &quot;whole world&quot; is trying to access the site meow.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t get in, either wait a few hours OR use a new identity/restart TOR browser.

I see all the post ,s about these attacks and nobody seems to ask or say who is doing this .only that it is someone with the motive to destroy SR...... Who has the motive and time and energy &quot;and the cash&quot; To do something like this.....?&nbsp; hmmmmmmm....?? let me think about this..Im not going to accuse anyone but it would&nbsp; seem that only certain agencys would have the resources ,time and motivation to pull something off like this no ?<br />Why would some hacker decide to make DOS attacks against SR. and !&nbsp; its forums..If it was only&nbsp; a lone wolf hacker that was interested in showing his skills on the key board then there are alot better places that would be alot more respected by the hacker community to hit no ?&nbsp; This stinks of LE and they would seem to be the only group that would benifit from doing something like this.<br />Im not trying to scare people but if someone was hacking SR why in the hell would they take a shot at the SR forum / that makes no sense.I think that if one was going to make trouble for SR they would hack the site and make off with as much BTC as possible.<br />Well DPR please keep up the good work we are all behind you! Also i believe i speak for all when i say the the whole community is behind you .<br /><br />ps .. Thousands of year from now when we all pass from this mortal coil the name SR and DPR will be in the history books .This is a monumental time what you have done and what we are a part of is revolutionary .Im glad to be a part of it...peace

				This sight is revolutionary indeed. I have been on this road for a long time, and have spent a lot of time lurking these forums, not commenting nearly enough as I should. During the last few days, I have read a lot of comments that have made statements to the effect of how we will read of this website in the future, and how it will be a part of history, ect..I have recently realized just how true those statements are. The fact that this site is still resilient after being attacked by who-the-fuck-knows, and also after being publicly outed to LE and the general population (Gawker), is unbelievable. We will surely read about us in the future. Maybe we&#039;ll still be buying quality drugs from home at ease, or maybe we&#039;ll just be reminiscing about a man/woman/program/ named DPR, who gave us the most unbelievable and brazen gift fringe dwellers have ever seen...

				Community,<br /><br />I am not one to complain at all and I appreciate everything the staff has done to try and fix this problem, I am just coming to the point where I am extremely frustrated. I mean when is enough, enough?! I cannot even stay on the site long enough to put up a listing, it is like jump for joy if I can move a coin or two. And you can definitely tell that SR runs the bitcoin market. In my opinion, people are losing there confidence in the site and are pulling there money out and converting it to cash because of the future uncertainty. <br /><br />Please do not take any of this the wrong way, DPR you are the man and have done so much for all of us and me personally. I just do not know how to react at this point when I cannot stay on the site for more than 3 minutes without timing out. I mean what are some other options here... Does anyone else feel the same way.. I dont know, sorry for venting, I will either go down with SR or keep going with SR but I refuse to work at any of these other sites I just do not trust it.... There needs to be a way we can make this more of a private place, maybe close registrations for awhile, I dont know... I hope I am not alone on this.<br /><br />Is anyone else getting this every time trying to put up an order:<br /><br />Sorry, an error was encountered.<br /><br />We could not process your request.

				Just when I was going to order.<br />It seems like whoever is knocking down SR stops long enough to let people pull their BTC out to shop at another site. Those of us that stay loyal they hope to create longer and longer times of not being able to get on SR thus making those members frustrated and hopefully they will leave too. Maybe its to tie up more orders when it does go down again and frustrate more people into leaving,<br />Stick a few people in the SR forums to spread the word about other sites and ordering there. Thats all it would take for some to just wander away.<br />Myself I aint going anywhere. <br /><br />WARNING:<br />Im a suspicious person by nature and have no real understanding of how these things work.

				TL;DR: Update your Tor Browser Bundle. <br />https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html<br /><br />I got in once yesterday just after DPRs last update. After that I&#039;ve had trouble getting the page to load. Tried several times with different identities without luck. Decided to get the latest Tor Browser Bundle update. Ever since then it has been smoothing sailing. Don&#039;t know if that was the cause of my connection problems, but to whoever has trouble getting onto the site; try to update your Tor Browser! Maybe DPR has implemented some change that requires the latest version?

				Calm heads prevail. <br /><br />When you select the button on Tor &quot;New Identity&quot; that changes your location, thus a new chance of getting on. <br /><br />If you have tried a few new identities and still no go, (1) Restart Tor, completely stop the service, then restart it.<br />(2) Smoke a bowl, watch a show, give it 1hr or so, and return ON a new identity.<br /><br />Basic troubleshooting folks! <br />:)<br /><br />-F&amp;H

				Protip for anyone who still can&#039;t connect:<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t get a connection at all on either my desktop or laptop.<br /><br />Updated tor browser to the latest version and now it&#039;s working flawlessly on both.<br /><br />No idea why, but SR would not connect whatsoever on the old version.

				It is probably not even a DOS attack right now, could just be tons of traffic. I&#039;ve been in and out all day and gotten orders all day so it has been working. Right now currently I can&#039;t get in but I am not worried about having to go back to my day job because I know how many obsticals DPR and his team have had to go through since launching the site and they have got through ALL of them. He is truly making history with this site and what does not kill it can only make it stronger. The only other &quot;online black markets&quot; I know about all seem like garbage compared to the road....I have not made any accounts on them and never will as long as the road as here, and I believe it will be here for awhile :)<br /><br />I have managed to get in, process orders and send lots of messages but as I said, its been slow and in and out but I think it&#039;s just due to a lot of site traffic and not DOS traffic.

				It seems like it is a lottery to get in. 9/10 times I get the server too busy error so I keep hitting try again. After about five times I open the forums to see and keep refreshing the other tab.

				It was working flawlessly for me the last two days, and was suprisingly fast. The past hour its been timing out for me but I did see scout mention in another thread that we may still be getting attacked but I guess DPR and his pirate crew but measures in place so he can&#039;t fully deny the service to the site overall. So it may be intermittent at the time being but hey, to me thats a small price to pay for one stop shopping on all things consciousness expanding.&nbsp; 8) 8) <br /><br />LONG LIVE THE ROAD!!

				Be patient and diligent. I took care of my business for the day, so I will sign off in hopes that one of you having trouble can sign on. My old version of Tor seemed to connect and browse faster than the new one before the drama. The Tor update has been more reliable to get to the login screen ever since. <br /><br />Make sure you give it something like 4 goes at it, before you use a new identity. I have been opening two tabs to attempt to get to the login, then close out one of &#039;em when I do. It has taken me two or three attempts, and sometimes two or three identities, but it has worked nonetheless. No where near as fast as I was experiencing, but still reliable. Don&#039;t fret...I have faith in all of you being able to log on.

				I think the error is a good sign, actually. An error page instead of just a connection timeout means that the server is failing gracefully. It&#039;s a visible sign of the progress that DPR and crew are making behind the scenes to withstand and/or recover from this attack.<br /><br />An analogy: You haven&#039;t seen your friend in a long time, and you&#039;re getting worried. You go to his place and knock on the door. Consider the two following results:<br /><br />1. Your friend talks through the door and tells you that he&#039;s super-sick right now and he doesn&#039;t want to open the door and breathe his horrible germs on you.<br /><br />2. There is no response.<br /><br />Which would you prefer?

				So what is the plan? We can not continue doing business like this. Can we get another way to connect with our vendors? I am unable to finalize an order for a loved vendor. We must come up with a better way to communicate, vendors and customers while this site is down (which it is as I type this). I have no contact info on my 2 favorite vendors and I need to get in touch with them. Any suggestions? Should I create a post with the vendor&#039;s name and simply ask him for his email or what? How do I explain I CAN NOT finalize for him! This breaks my heart.

				If you can&#039;t reach the site, chances are that he can&#039;t either. I&#039;m sure he completely understands that it&#039;s not your fault that you can&#039;t finalize.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, and I think the SR staff usually put all count-downs on hold during extended downtimes, so there&#039;s no need to worry about anything auto-finalizing while the site is down, either.

				It&#039;s interesting to see how this affects the btc rate, the more this unfolds and other attacks on exchanges too it seems fairly clear the main motive is to try to bring down the rate.<br /><br />So my best advice is not to panic, the attacker can&#039;t keep it up forever and I have absolute faith in DPR and team that things will return to normal and we will be safer in future because of this. 8)

				Indeed! +1<br /><br />shunyata-<br /><br />Much as I hope that my customers understand that some delay in shipment/order processing is inevitable as we experience these site attacks, so do I as a vendor understand that delays in finalization are bound to occur, and are completely outside the control of either party. I wouldn&#039;t even hold it against someone particularly for not checking for a full day or 2, given everything that&#039;s been happening. That being said, it was quite heartwarming to watch the flood of orders being finalized the last time the site came up after being completely down for 2 days.<br /><br />Good vendors and customers alike will maintain their relationships through this time of trouble! &lt;3

				To the post asking &#039;What will we do&#039;? <br /><br />Bro this site goes through this off and on every so many mnths, not the attack but issues, were the LARGEST BM on TOR, Im sure after last Hit of the DOS, not DDOS BTW, Im sure DPR is upgrading everything he can and hiring or bringing on whoever he can trust, who knws, but the man works hard,him and the whole DPR team, Allotof people probley would of said FUCK ALL THIS SHIT by now, having to due what he does to keep this site a float, i mean of course he gets millions x 10 im sure but still they are always on call..<br /><br />And there are other market places, and supose new one to come, I dont see it being &#039;DISLOYAL&#039; AS SOME SAY even u cant get your drugs or meds some ppl need or get sick from another site like BMR, I would only use vendors there from here and no new guys, if so if they wont let me stay in escrow even with my perfect SR stats and thousands iv spent with no issues, thn fuck it, i will never FE for no one iv never done business with before, SO its a good idea for vendors Imo TO have thir stuff on BMR at least there, im still up in the air bout atlantise, If i use it, i will NEVER use their own encryption device thingy they have.. <br /><br />

DPR stated the attacker must have prepared for this attack for a long time and has fleshed out a strategy to counteract measures DPR and crew would take to combat. But no matter how long it lasts, or how much effort this attacker wants to put forth, it will all succumb to the will of the people. SR represents a choice many people do not have, and a choice many people want. The attacker intrinsically must not understand this, no matter if hes motivated by money or ideology. Even at the worst, if for some god forsaken reason it brings SR to its knees, it will rise from the ashes like a phoenix. Even if LE is behind this, or steps in while SR is weakened due to this. It will not matter. Even if TOR developers cooperate with LE, it will not matter. The floodgates have been opened. A precedent has been set. Pandora&#039;s box has been opened with no way of it ever being closed. Weak-minded individuals like those in LE and this attacker will never realize this, and some day if the light ever clicks in their head will realize how futile these attempts will ultimately be.

This is his lively hood as well as a political statement, do you think he&#039;s just going to let it flop? I assure you that this time is being used constructively to combat the 0-day exploits on Tor. The idea that these issues are not going to subside is ludicrous and demonstrate a very big lack of faith in humanity.

				My own uninformed guess is organized crime is the source of the current problems vs LE. I am surprised no one else has mentioned this possibility. For example, Russia has a surplus of very smart programmers in addition to having some of the world&#039;s most sophisticated, ruthless, and cash rich criminal gangs. <br /><br />SR has created a highly profitable, anonymous, and unregulated market. Add in the huge barriers to LE and it would seem to be a tempting target for those types. It also seems plausible that they funded/control Atlantis and are now attacking SR for the obvious competitive benefits. <br /><br />Pure uninformed speculation, although the Atlantis admin&#039;s name is &quot;Vladimir&quot; and he did write &quot;Dead Pirate Roberts&quot; in his statement ;-)<br /><br />

				Guys and Gals, <br /><br />Please relax and stay calm. Your money is safe in the SR, your orders are safe. DDOS simply means taking the site offline for a day, and in this case the attacker has set up many servers and comps to do a pretty big attack. DDOS attacks do end btw, and then you will be able to access the site.&nbsp; Just refrain from trying to login until DPR says it is ok, and I assure you they will. Useless traffic going to the site further complicates things.

				How can they (meaning DPR team) make the attacks stop??! I mean if they get the identity of the attacker(s), you could always beat them to an inch of their lives or further. Or just do a mexican cartel job on their asses. But I for one dont really think they will get any irl people connected to this attack, I think its LE @ work, trying to screw with the rebel drug users of the world. And yes, i have my tinfoil hat ready ;) <br /><br />I hope DPR and his team manage to push the invaders out on the plank, and down to the sharks. Keep up the good work. <br /><br />Never give up!

It&#039;s simply a contingency plan in case the forum gets attacked again. If anything, it is going discourage further attacks on the forum since it now appears to be futile to attempt to block communication between vendors and users.<br /><br />Those URLs that could replace silkroadvb5piz3r.onion have been around for ages as a backup in case something went wrong. That announcement is not the death-knell of SR, it just puts everyone in an even stronger position vs. the attacker. Some of the updates in this thread sound WAY more ominous to me, and it seems like we&#039;re in a better position now than when site would be solidly down for &quot;at least a few days&quot; (which of course never happened).

				I was able to get in briefly last night to check to see if my order went, and to send a not so nice message to my vendor asking why it hadn&#039;t gone out.

Some say it&#039;s LiteCoin but if the value of Bitcoin goes up when SR goes down then what&#039;s the point? Some say LE but then why not take down a more dangerous site like BMR? One person tried to insinuate it&#039;s a scam by DPR but that makes absolutely no sense.<br /><br />Yeah we all like to talk about it. But what I&#039;d really like to know is what, if anything, I can do to help SR? There is a thread (I didn&#039;t copy the link) that says we should all try setting up our clients to run as non-exit relays thus increasing the bandwidth available inside the network and making a ddos more difficult for the attacker. Will that work? I&#039;m not sure, it seems to me that other sites are responding fast enough including the forum here. It seems pretty targeted to me. But I&#039;m going to set mine up that way anyway in case there is some logic to it.

				If the site starts slowing down for you again, or you can&#039;t reach it, restart your TorBrowser.<br /><br />Usually that&#039;s useless advice, but it actually helps this time.<br />

				I really must thank all of the vendors who have to put up with BS from people ordering $20 worth of something. It must really be hard not to blow a gasket. Anyway, I&#039;ve spent a ton and never complained or bitched to anyone. I have enough sense to realize that it&#039;s a blessing and a privilege to use SR. Anyway, thanks again to the vendors.

				I&#039;ve discovered that increasing http keep-alive timeout seems to help make the connection stay solid longer, though it conks out a bit after a few hours, then comes back again. One of the posts further back reflecting on how important a part of their life SR has become, same applies to me. I haven&#039;t yet been able to gain the full benefits yet due to a somewhat busted financial situation but a couple weeks ago i got some bubble hash from the dam and man it was good to be stoned again after two months without.<br /><br />Unfortunately on top of SR downtime here in BG the idiots in the government decided it would be ok to have 4 public holidays back to back and I&#039;ve been delayed in getting funds out of bitstamp as well as it&#039;s basically been 6 straight days of holidays and banks mostly closed (my bank is one of the cool ones, the office just down the road is open 12/7 and does instant domestic transfers any day of the week). <br /><br />oh yeah, and no mail either, not that I am expecting anything, but posting out can&#039;t be done until tuesday so I have an order still up in the air waiting to be posted out, and a re-delivery that is also waiting. I hope that there is no trouble for at least a few weeks so I can finally get my vendor bond back, and at least one order goes through and then I can finally pay my rent and get to extracting a batch of MHRB that I&#039;ve got everything ready for except the MHRB, and finally start to make a decent amount of money out of this.<br /><br />My connection isn&#039;t as solid as it had been yesterday but it&#039;s no worse than it ever has been. Sometimes I have to click reload a few times before it comes up and occasionally the error page comes up but it&#039;s totally usable. The forum is rock solid also.<br /><br />Long live the fighters! The sleeper shall awaken!

				I usually get quite awhile, like at least 30 minute intervals minimum before i get logged off and I am not going to complain at all! :) because I can still easily conduct business, people can still easily place orders or do whatever they need to do and if it helps keep the site running as fast and as great as it is now, I could live with the auto-log off every once in a while! :) <br /><br />

				It works out for some. For others it closes out at the most important times-when you are done writing a message and want to hit send or are ready to click order. This is very discouraging and frustrating. <br />People are heading over to Atlantis because they cant RELY on anything here anymore. <br />This screws vendors and customers alike. Its a shame.<br />It just feels like the attackers are winning here.<br />&nbsp;:&#039;(

				Thanks for all the time and effort you are putting into this Dpr and everybody you have helping you. Just to be able to post this at the moment means that You lot are doing wonders for our beloved community. <br />The guy will always be able to attack in many ways. So we will need some sort of new system or re-definition of the netowrk as you say to keep constantly on top, However even a re-structure might not work, as a hacker this skilled can re-structure his attack to fit around the new network, He obviously knows how it all works.<br />I hope you can overcome this hacker and may the wind be at your back. <br />A big thank you DPR.

				Yes!&nbsp; A belated congratulations and a big THANK YOU to DPR and the crew for rescuing SR. It&#039;s working better than ever now.&nbsp; and to think I almost dropped coin and made a purchase through BMR!&nbsp; But I&#039;m too loyal to SR, I just couldn&#039;t do it and stayed patient.&nbsp; So glad I did.<br /><br />Keep up the great work DPR!&nbsp; We appreciate your efforts in this fight. <br /><br /><br />BigFlake

				Hello, <br />i didn&#039;t lurked here some weeks. <br /><br />Is there currently a problem with Bitcoin deposits to SR?<br />(0 confirmations since four hours)<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: additional info: I used &quot;get new address&quot; about 10 hours before the transaction to SR.<br /><br />Edit: Update: 6-7 hours later the transaction arrived.
