				I have been using silk road for a few months now. In fact I have gotten used to be able to get anything I want. This is really something special. I am just pissing away money trying everything I ever wanted and having a hell of a good time. But Ive noticed that its hard and hard to get BitCoins........<br /><br />I like to just give a Money Pak code and get BitCoins its fast and easy.<br /><br />But god forbid that is like gambling in an indian casino, at best you will get a poor deal. <br /><br />As one person I have to sell my soul 2 try to find someone to get maybe $500-$800 of coins a week.<br /><br />Get-BitCoin that was great. Now its gone. There is some chinese sounding guy that claims he sells them, the current price is $3.01 he is charging just $3.66 and a $10 fee. So wow this muther fucker is making some loot.<br /><br />So I cant afford any of these exchangers they charge so much. But I shouldnt have to pay so much to get bitcoins. <br /><br />During my whole dealing on silk road i feel like I am most vunerable when buying bitcoins because thats the only times ive been ripped off..<br /><br />I have placed maybe 30 or 40 orders and got all but like 3. For the most part if I use my brain and pick a high rated seller i get high.<br /><br />But with the bitcoin exchangers hell so far ive been ripped off 35% of the time when dealing with them.<br /><br />So of course I dont use BitCoin exchangers any more I am going to try going 2 a bank and droping get-bitcoin.com some money........Ill let you know how it goes

				I give your thread title a look of disapproval.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(<br /><br />I&#039;ve personally dealt with SumYunGai and he is fantastic.&nbsp; He scams ZERO% of the time.&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve been ripped off 35% of the time, why not learn from your own mistakes and do the full proof - cheapest - form which is Dwolla -&gt; exchange -&gt; wallet tumbling -&gt; SR?&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have patience, you are your own demise.&nbsp; Taking out your frustrations about willingly gambling with clearly unstable exchangers that don&#039;t have an esteemed and well decorated reputation and branding ALL exchangers scammers is really not the way to go around here.&nbsp; Sure there are some scammers, but there are some fantastic 100% legit exchangers.

				You are right 90% of the time, but i can also vouch for sum yun gai. On multiple occasions i have had my bitcoins in less than an hour. If you read his reviews or anywhere on the forum the same is said. Its risky with any new vendor, but sum yun gai has proven time and time again he is the only trused one.&nbsp;

				I too want to vouch for SumYunGai. I have had 100% success with monepak -&gt; btc exchangers! Because I have never used anyone but SYG. Recently he has increased the fee he charges because there has been an overwhelming number of requests and he was not able to obtain enough btc to fulfill them all. A few days of patience payed of as always though! Generally you have coins in minutes, so the btc value doesnt have time to change and it is worth the fee to be able to quickly grab the listing before it disappears. Definitely a fair and trustworthy bitcoin exchanger. <br /><br />I have also done a cash deposit through Get-bitcoin and would recommend the service! Got my coins the same day.

				You want ball clenching transactions, try sending multiple $1K WU orders to Ukrainians and Russians to convert into Liberty Reserve.&nbsp; You wait for a while refreshing your WU transaction update screen, and then when it changes to picked up, you sweat until the funds are deposited into your LR account.

				As far as I know, Borneo and BTC Buddy are honest exchangers too. I&#039;ve used BTC Buddy a couple times but not Borneo. They can only process a limited amount of transfers per day so you might have to wait a day to get funds.

				I&#039;m here to stay folks. I&#039;ve navigated my share of troubles with GreenDot, banks, etc. I&#039;m selling at 3.5 right now and my fee is high because I&#039;m limited in both the number of paks I can do as well as the total value. Please don&#039;t message me asking to do the math for you or haggling over your $100 moneypak, no offense, I love you all. :) if my price is more than you want to pay for your $300+ moneypak, send me an offer. It doesn&#039;t offend me as long as &quot;no&quot; doesn&#039;t offend you. :)<br /><br />I&#039;m working the recipe on this. I plan to open a revolutionary new kind of exchange very soon and will offer a better value than ever before. Right now however, I&#039;m going through some growing pains. Good help is hard to find and even harder to trust. I&#039;m doing everything to maintain the level of service you&#039;ve come to expect, while protecting the integrity you all deserve.

				I don&#039;t think they are dishonest.&nbsp; I just think it&#039;s good for newbies to understand that buying bitcoins on here is discouraged for the simple reason that they sellers provide *no* protection whatsoever.&nbsp; I know sumyungai&#039;s alright: too many of my friends have said he is, for me not to believe it.&nbsp; Hell, I personally think SugarMama&#039;s alright too, seeing as she started selling btc at probably the worst time for btc sellers since site began, and took quite a bit of flack, and reacted calmly and decently about the whole thing...I think she, and sum, and any of the legitimate sellers realize the dilemma we have: we fear that if we act like this is an &#039;ok&#039; way to buy bitcoins, then the scammers slide in, copy you guys exactly, and before they understand the difference, a whole new crew of rookies here get ripped.<br /><br />And the more &#039;outside of escrow&#039; vendors set up shop here, the more we become like every other site on the web, which is to say: mostly ripoffs.&nbsp; Escrow is what makes us different, what gets us the attention, and why people come here.&nbsp; Vendors who sell without escrow, kind of benefit from the good reputation here, without adding to it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still think it wouldn&#039;t be *that* hard for some honest btc vendor to find a way to provide protection for buyers...if I were a legit btc vendor, that&#039;s what I&#039;d be doing...find somewhere/somebody to hold the funds, and also hold the btc...when both are inplace, ensure the transfer.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />At this time I tell newbies to guy btc at get-bitcoin.com, as it&#039;s the easiest, and it&#039;s doing fine.&nbsp; If they have to buy btc on here, I understand, but I just want them to understand that if/when it goes bad, there is no protection...and it&#039;s not just SR as usual: it&#039;s an exception to the way things are done here...

				Borneo should be back at some point, and in force. He&#039;s also ripped 0% of people off. Might take a week or two for him to show up again, but when he does... 5% fee (on &gt; $300) and always with the current SR BTC price quoted at the bottom of the screen. Can&#039;t be beat - except when he&#039;s gone of course :o(. Maybe if we all meditate on his return he&#039;ll be back quicker!&nbsp; ;D
