				I&#039;m brewing that my excellent stats have been shattered by a partial refund on a no show parcel I think this is totally bollox man, what do you lot think has it happened to you if so do you think something else should be done on no show parcels cos the stats we get for them are no fault of our own if everyone makes a loud enough hoo haa about this I&#039;m sure the stats we&#039;ve been conned out of will all be scrapped help me and yourself out people cheers.

				You have to negotiate outside of SR resolutions. You can ask vendor to give you a refund using person to person BTC transfer on the account page. This avoids SR resolutions and you won&#039;t get a ding on your refund rate statistic.

				Yeah thanks for that but even still ie, the vendor being a basket case and making it go through resolution but really it&#039;s not your fault is it so from a perfect clean slate 1 basket case just comes along and F, it all up for you, anyway all good cheers mate.

				That sucks.&nbsp; Good suggestion working it out with the vendor.<br /><br />I&#039;ve kept my perfect stats by not asking for a refund and just taking the hit. <br />I have a 2nd account I use for risky purchases that may go wrong or using a new or young vendor. <br /><br />Two accounts.&nbsp; &nbsp;No sense in having one account with over $3000. In purchases.&nbsp; Start a new one at that point and keep the old one for when you want to impress a vendor.&nbsp; :-)

				Just keep buying packs I have over 40 orders so by this point I wouldn&#039;t really care whether one of them was refunded because it would make my refund percentage, what, 2-3%?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think its a good idea to use a new account for riskier vendors, why not just use an older one because usually those impress those newb vendors more and surprisingly often I&#039;ve noticed they&#039;ll offer you deals not offered to the public simply due to your stats. You&#039;d also have to work that charisma a bit.
