				Do they realize they are losing business?&nbsp; I know there are certain countries I will not order from because of possible customs problems.&nbsp; Don&#039;t they realize it is to the advantage of both the seller and the buyer to know where it is being shipped from?

				- guess the intention is to remain anonymous and / or they have different shipping / posting routes, a partner or supplier posting from eu and themselves us ...lets say..<br /><br />- if you are just looking at the list of subs in the table then rather drill down and find out more about the vendor......if its the product what you&#039;re after rather than where it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;comes from...!?<br /><br />- some vendors do add detail on their profile but often its not descriptive enough...<br /><br />

They ship from several countries, while avoiding high risk ones (like Netherlands). Asbjorn does something similar (although he does declare his own country, which may or may not be that). I actually like this. I mean, if they are actually actively working on the problem of intercepted deliveries in a rational, smart way, then more power to them.

				Yea I bet its a security issue... the less LE knows the better. I don&#039;t care where it comes from as long as its not from the Netherlands since their customs likes to open packages and do all the drugs.
