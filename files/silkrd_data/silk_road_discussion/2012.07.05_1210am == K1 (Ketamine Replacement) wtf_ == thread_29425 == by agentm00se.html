				doesnt anyone here get itchy feet about these new RC&#039;s? i mean i enjoyed the Mephedrone run in the UK as it was pure rave fuel, its just when the kids started getting hooked and being up 4 nights running &amp; the desperation when it started getting cut.<br /><br />least of all what it actually does to you long term. at least with 90% if banned substances; the amount of propaganda brought against them meant that the documentation of possible side effects actually occurred!<br /><br />saying that, many of Shulgins compounds are only 50 years old....

				I remember reading on bluelight about a new K analogue after the MXE ban in the UK (3/4-MEO-PCP don&#039;t seem to be selling too well, and so this new K analogue was going to go mainstream), I&#039;ve totally forgot the chemical name but I think you&#039;ll find it the thread in EADD somewhere, or just ADD. Perhaps this has something to do with it.<br /><br />His product would maybe sell better if there was an erowid entry or something, &quot;K1&quot; is incredibly vague and just looks shifty, like he&#039;s mixed a bunch of K/MXE/PCP analogues together and given it his own name.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that is what he has done, it could be the ultimate dissociative that gives you a full-on body orgasm hours with no ill-effects whatsoever, but there&#039;s no information to go on and like some of the posters in this topic I&#039;m extremely wary of RCs anyway.<br /><br />It&#039;s ike calling MXE &quot;roflcopter&quot;. What the fuck does roflcopter tell you exactly? It tells the kids to insufflate a huge coke-sized line and then &quot;rofl&quot; the night away in A&amp;E as the gov&#039;t prepare the banhammer once again.<br /><br />I&#039;ll stick to K myself until there is more information on this, and I hope sonicdrone puts up more info, just for harm-reduction purposes.

				I have no idea what K1 is, I&#039;ve seen it on SR aswell but have had no urge to purchase it.. I have no desire to compromise and replace something that I already have access too! <br /><br />Having said this before I discovered SR I was in a major ketamine drought and hadn&#039;t of been able to get hold of any ketamine for months (probably about 5 months). I took to google to find an alternative and found MXE which after testing I didn&#039;t think it was similar to ketamine at all really, I ordered a gram of it from a RC website. Did it with 2 friends and it really fucked me up vaguely remember walking round my estate and feeling the need to hug lamposts and just chatting alot of random shit.. really weird lol.<br /><br />I do know that there is a new compound that the RC website will be stocking in August called 2-MeO-Ketamine which is an analogue of ketamine which makes it legal, it&#039;s supposed to be the closest thing to ketamine thats legal.. not sure what to think of it, I still stand by not having a desire to replace something when I can get the real thing but if people like it and it turns out to be nice I will probably give it a go.

				Like the closest to a Khole was just like an aura around my head.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ive been deep in a MXE experience and I was living FinalFantasy XIII which was a lot better than the game itself.&nbsp; I traveled the&nbsp; Serpent Road, I was a little pixie dot circling around the globe.&nbsp; &nbsp; I even flew into my nephews house and I sat on his nose.&nbsp; It was so fucking Weird.<br /><br />K1 was IMO weaker than real K, it is it&#039;s own experience.&nbsp; It made my head feel like a ballon I guess.&nbsp; &nbsp; kinda hard to remember that night.
