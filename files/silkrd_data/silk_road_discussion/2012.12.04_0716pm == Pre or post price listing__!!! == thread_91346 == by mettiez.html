				Ok, so I just want the amount of the item listed to be the same price as it is at check out. Everytime I switch back and forth, my prices change, and its confusing the shit out of me.<br /><br />So to be clear, which setting should I use to that a buyer will pay the same price that he sees the item listed as?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for help with this admittedly stupid question!!!<br /><br />
