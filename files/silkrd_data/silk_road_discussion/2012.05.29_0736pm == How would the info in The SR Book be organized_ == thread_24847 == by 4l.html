				The last few months have seen a lot of questions that have already been asked, and answered, more than once before.&nbsp; I think it would be valuable to codify the information buried in these forums so that the awesome security people here are not so overburdened. <br /><br />One big obstacle I see in organizing this info is how regionally-dependent much of it is.&nbsp; Buying bitcoin, shipping/receiving, and legal considerations would all vary to different degrees across countries.<br /><br />Another consideration is that there are ideal levels of security, and then there are levels of security that most users are reasonably capable of attaining.&nbsp; For example, it is unreasonable to expect a new user to have a fake ID and so a security plan contingent upon this would not be helpful.<br /><br />There would also need to be some way for the community to edit the book, as much of the information and best practices are bound to change over time.<br /><br />I would be curious to see people post their idea of what the index to a Silk Road book would look like.&nbsp; Any ideas on a title?&nbsp; How about &quot;The Silk Road: a Guide to Pissing off the Feds&quot;?

				I Understand the reasons for doing smething like this but i feel that if someone wants to use SR safely they should be prepared to lurk the forums, read the sticky posts, search for specific problems and then post when you cannot find a solution. most topics have been covered at least once in the forum history. that way it ensures the safety of all involved because it takes a little bit of work and that will put off some of the less serious vendors and buyers.
