				These web articles will be the death of the road :-(... Some 1337 haX0rz should be taking down/defacing those sites to divert traffic :-p (I&#039;m being mostly sarcastic here haha)

				The guy says he did not purchase anything and refers to people who use this webiste as criminals but he is promoting Silk Road big time with that article so the sense I get is that he beliefs in a free market. Anyone interested in drugs who doesn&#039;t know about silkroad and reads this article will probably become customers.

				I love the way the internet is full of people who seem to need to have a voice in this manor. They are reporters because a few thousand idiots read their obscure blog on some large news/tech site. The nature of all communication is like this. Everyone talks all the time, but there&#039;s very little information to go around. Oh some new info, gotta blog about that. Gotta tell everyone I know multiple times.
