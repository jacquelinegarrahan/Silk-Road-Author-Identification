				Hey folks,<br />It&#039;s your friendly neighborhood forum admin, though, I&#039;m coming here to say I&#039;m resigning. I&#039;ve loved traveling the road with you awesome buyers. I&#039;ve been hitting a point where I&#039;m ready to settle down, quell the paranoid lifestyle, be done with the darknet, quit while I&#039;m ahead and what have you. <br />Simply put, this has been one of the the greatest times of my life. This project is wonderful, and has allot of potential, it could change the way people access stuff that should be personally free in a safe environment. I&#039;m so glad to have seen it come this far, and even more so that the DPR has kept such a diligent&nbsp; hand on the wheel. With him leading this, I&#039;m sure it will continue smoothly. Having been here from the very start I can say I&#039;ve seen nothing but this place grow for the better. <br />Personally, I&#039;ve come to meet some wonderful, lovely, intelligent people on here and I truly would like to thank them. I won&#039;t mention them by name for security reasons but you know who you are :)&nbsp; You&#039;ve made the travels here some of the most supportive, and thoughtful of my long life. <br />However times come, I&#039;m settling down, relaxing, handing the position over. Speaking of, I&#039;ve had the joy of training / working with your new forum admin Indica|Sativa. I&#039;m not sure when they&#039;ll post, but from now on if you need something you&#039;ll have to message them. I&#039;ll be on today, and perhaps some of tomorrow. <br /><br />It&#039;s been great traveling with you. I love you all :) <br /><br />~Digi
