				Dude they are well reputed here and have no reason to scam. Putting myself in to their shoes, they could not have replied considering the 100&#039;s of msg they get; some being not replied to as the answers are obvious or in the profile. Framing someone for a scammer for not replying to your msg is absurd to a degree.

				Your not from the uk, take a look at his feedback, so many from the uk not getting their orders and being ripped off!<br /><br />Im just warning uk customers not to get stitched up like me and many others. Answering messages and supporting customers, like every other venor i have used seems simple to them, but not chembros!<br /><br />Take the money laugh in your face and move on to there next victim.

				I feel I should just say I&#039;ve had many transactions (10+) with Chemical Brothers all shipped to the UK and they all arrived within a week.<br /><br />Anyway, they never require you to FE and offer a reship if it doesn&#039;t arrive, so you shouldn&#039;t have a problem!<br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br /><br />P

				I think a lot of people in this thread are getting two sellers confused.<br /><br />Chembros and chemical brothers are two different sellers. The OP seems to be speaking about chembros. <br /><br />Just wanted to clear up the confusion.

				Indeed.<br />I&#039;m new here and wasn&#039;t aware of a seller called Chembros but the fact that a seller would would pick a name that seems obviously chosen to trade off somebody else&#039;s good reputation would immediately set alarm bells ringing. Sorry to hear of your woes OP but it&#039;s a risk we all take if we finalise early and allow sellers to opt out of the escrow system.<br />FWIW I made my first SR purchase from Chemical Brothers and it was shipped the same day and arrived in four days, including a weekend so two business days, and it had to cross an extra body of water from where you are. All within escrow too.<br />I&#039;ve already raved about CBs in another post but I think sellers who provide top service WITHIN the system are to be celebrated.
