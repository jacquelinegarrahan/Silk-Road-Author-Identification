				Hi @ all.....<br /><br />one thing about DPR capture made me very skeptical.....<br /><br />Why should the FBI/DEA etc.&nbsp; close Silkroad??? Why they don&#039;t let it online&nbsp; until they have all informations about all vendor, bulk buyers etc...<br />Why they close Silkroad - but&nbsp; not the Forum?<br /><br />Was DPR running the site alone?!?! ---- NO WAY!!!! THAT&#039;S 4 SURE... THERE WAS INVOLVED MANY OTHERS!<br /><br />So i think DPR close the site by himself, like Atlantis have done... took all the money.!!<br /><br />I hope i&#039;m wrong with my suggestions but what happened is very odd.....<br /><br />Sorry but english is not my native language, hope you all understand what i&#039;m trying to tell ya...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				You said&nbsp; they got him , but there&#039;s a difference.... -&nbsp; &nbsp;THEY GOT ONE!!!!<br />&nbsp;Do you really think Silkroad was managed by one person???<br /><br />I don&#039;t think so, that&#039;s nearly impossible....

There&#039;s nothing about this case to be found on websites from the FBI and DEA, not even on their twitter accounts. I haven&#039;t been able to find any FBI-spokesman comment on the case. (just an ex-fed, who is probably no better informed than any of us).<br /><br />All I&#039;ve seen is:<br /><br />* Numerous news reports. Essentially worth crap, if you can get one reliable one to publish your story (bribery!), everyone else will copy it. And nobody checks their sources. Trust me, nobody has called the FBI to verify this.<br />* A 39-page report that&#039;s never hosted on any government website. If I was going to stage being arrested, or my death, or anything like that, I&#039;d surely write something like that. Completely doable.<br />* Well that&#039;s it really..<br /><br />In the end I guess time will tell. If there is a trial at some point I guess that&#039;ll appear somewhere on a government website. Until that happens (or somebody points me to some governmental source that mentions Ulbricht or Silk Road), I can&#039;t rule out that it&#039;s all hearsay.

				Just because there hasn&#039;t been much proof to show it, other than many many articles and news stories, hardly counts that it didn&#039;t happen. I interestingly couldnt find any arrest information on him from where he was supposedly arrested which is interesting but still, like what others are saying time will tell. One reason that I heard that silkroad wasn&#039;t remained open even after FBI seized is because its technically against the law for them to pose as someone else, say DPR and to continue with normal runnings. Not sure how true that is or not though.

My personal guess is that up to roughly 7 people can beinvolved in a web of lies for a limited period of time (weeks, months) without leaking.<br /><br />If the web of lies has to last a lifetime, my personal guess is the maximum is about 4. That&#039;s what I consider the maximum: if anyone is weak, any lie can be uncovered, but let&#039;s assume everyone is strong.<br /><br />Now I ask myself: how many people would have to be involved to create the story of DPR?<br /><br />1. DPR himself.<br />2. Brandon Leblanc. $80 million will probably buy his cooperation.<br />3. Someone to write that 39-page report. Could have been DPR, could have been Leblanc, could have been someone else.<br />4. Someone to draw the pictures from the court case. Could have been the same person as 1, 2 or 3.<br />5. Journalist that accepts a bribe to publish this story. May very well not be necessary if Leblanc feeds the information to the media directly. (and the media will consider Leblanc a sufficiently reliable source) Once the story has been published, all other newspapers just copy the story.<br /><br />The required number of people to hold up this potential web of lies so far: between 2 and 5. That&#039;s perfectly manageable.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s what has happened. But I wouldn&#039;t underestimate the capabilities of a man with $80 million either. I really just don&#039;t know. Call me agnostic. Maybe it&#039;s just because I have been told many very convincing lies in my life, I don&#039;t take much on faith anymore.<br /><br />When the potential web of lies grows too big - direct mention from FBI/DEA, arrest/trial information on government website, 5+ firsthand witness reports (can be LE as long as they&#039;re firsthand) who have seen Ulbricht cuffed/in court/knew him personally or video of Ulbricht in custody.. I&#039;ll accept this is really what happened. As long as I can&#039;t find any of that, I can&#039;t be really sure. I&#039;ve seen lies all over the media before. If you can&#039;t find a proper source for a story or hard-to-fake material, and especially when it seems a bit odd (which it does), you should remain a little bit wary.<br /><br />I still expect a proper source to pop up somewhere in the next few weeks, but I&#039;m surprised that so far I haven&#039;t been able to find any.<br /><br />Something in favor of the story: judge Joseph Spero is real. He would call the media if his name was used against his will, so he would have to be part of the web of lies. So this makes it more likely the media are correct. Still can&#039;t confirm it though, a few more names are needed before the web is too big.<br /><br />I actually forgot about Ulbricht. Assuming his existence can be verified (that is, him being in something that isn&#039;t purely web-fabricated like linkedin pages and/or being in archives many years before SR), he&#039;s another person in the potential web of lies since DPR and Ulbricht couldn&#039;t be the same person if it&#039;s a lie. That brings the total minimum (DPR, Ulbricht, Leblanc, Spero) to 4. Still possible.

				the fact that he was busted in a public library makes me wonder. the whole story stinks!they approached him about fake ids and he said anyone could buy them on sr? the same ids customs caught with their id sniffing dogs? and with heat he sign onto the servers off tor and goes into a public library?<br />of course there was a bust. but there so much more to the story and i feel its only its still going.<br /><br />DPR looks like some san fran fanook metrosexual flake. <br /><br />and i wouldn&#039;t trust no new silk road site. its either compromised or its goin g to be a huge scam. at least bmr has been around and if the same sr venders go there i dont see no problem.
