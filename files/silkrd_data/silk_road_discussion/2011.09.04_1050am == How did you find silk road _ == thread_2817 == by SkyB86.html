				Don&#039;t tell how you got here. JUST BE THANKFUL you are. Keep it on the Down Low as the kiddies say.&nbsp; 8) OR we could go and post URL&#039;s all around town in our SR Tshirts. Geez. Imagine the A-holes getting in then!! Tell only trusted like minded individuals. THAT means you prolly won&#039;t be telling someone everyday. And that&#039;s a good thing. Place your enthusiasm for the site in another direction. SAY... Live a safer life so you can continue using SR. Wear your seatbelt, everytime. Drive the speed limit and cautiously.&nbsp; Mix up your schedule a little. Involve yourself w/shadeball folks less. When you do be safer about it. Stuff like that. SURE. It&#039;s not as glamorous as a tshirt. Or cool as contraband in the mail, but the air is fresher and there is nothing like natural light. STAY OUT OF LE&#039;s GRASP. THINK incognito

				I&#039;ve been lurking on SR for many months. Someone on druggit mentioned a place called &quot;SR&quot;, but wouldn&#039;t expand on the subject.

				I stumbled upon it quite awhile ago on the hidden wiki. That was before things like feedback were implemented, so I wasn&#039;t comfortable making an order. A couple months ago I hit a dry spell and decided to check up on progress. To my great delight I was met with several high ranked vendors offering a plethora of herbal delights. I then spent a week enraged at how ridiculously long it took to buy bitcoins.

				Someone posted the onion address in the newb subforum of bitcoin forums a few months ago. Up until now I was uncertain if I wanted to do any business here, as the prices are/were much more than street. I probably shouldn&#039;t even try being a seller, but I might try selling some legal stuff as the hedging system is important for selling anything at all in an exchange based currency. I figure there are much less crooks here than on bitcointalk.

				I&#039;ve been a Tor user for a while now, though I never spent much time in hidden services (just wanted an anonymity layer for certain applications/websites).<br /><br />Saw a list of hidden services somewhere out on the clearnet and SR was one of them (thankfully it was the real link). From there I came to these forums about a month ago. I figured this would be a great place to figure out some more enhanced security measures.

				My dealer told me about this place which I thought was odd as I thought he&#039;d be concerned with losing business. After that, google was my enabler. <br /><br />It&#039;s not just SR I love tho, it&#039;s the anonymity provided by Tor. My searches have led me to read about some interesting stuff about all sorts from government corruption to detailed drug information and I&#039;ve met so many likely minded people with who I&#039;ve had some great discussions with. I probably would&#039;ve pussied out of reading and posting a lot of the material in trying to keep my real IP as law abiding as possible.<br /><br />Clearnet/Darknet to me is an incredible (if sometimes fucked up) place and I know I&#039;ve only skimmed the surface.

				My brother had been using TOR for a while, but never knew of the hidden wiki or SR or anything. Than we read an article about SR. So I got on TOR, found the hidden wiki, found SR forums and then found the link for SR on the forum. Never trusted the link on the hidden wiki, seemed too &#039;open&#039; if you could describe it like that...

				On a forum related to illegal steroids, oddly enough I had alot of experience shipping steroids so someone suggested I go here. Never got into selling on here, but that is what brought me here.

				Someone told me to Google &quot;You can buy anything on the internet&quot;, which I promptly did and one week later I figured out how to use TOR through You Tube and another website had the SR address on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;8) Yes, I am cool ;D

				I stumbled upon SR when I was googling for ways to browse the web anonymously and found out about Tor. Then, I found out about the deep web and websites that used .onion urls which lead me to hidden wiki. I actually found the SR forums before the actual site an I&#039;m glad I did, or I may have been an easy phishing victim not really paying attention to the correct SR url on HW. I&#039;ve been checking out both sites everyday and it&#039;s been a good experience thus far.

				Gawker article.&nbsp; I read it when it came out, but by the time I had found the page SR was &#039;temporarily not accepting new members.&#039;&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t stop thinking about it and used the time to read-read-read.&nbsp; I still find this site and SR as exciting as the first day I viewed them.&nbsp; This is the best thing since sliced MDMA

				I was sitting on a park bench downtolwn in an area known fer drug dealing. It was a scortching hot day and none of the dealers were out. I thought to myself that there must be a better way. I pulled out my phone and started googling. One of the very first results that came up was regarding SR. Within a few hours I was a member. End of story...or begining...
