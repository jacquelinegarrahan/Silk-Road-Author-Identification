				Just came in .. <br /><br />Hey HollyMolly,<br /><br />ich schreibe für VICE Deutschland. (vice.com)<br />Ich habe gesehen, dass du ein zuverlässiger Verkläufer aus Deutschland hier bei SilkRoad bist.<br /><br />Ich wollte anfragen, ob du uns ein Interview geben würdest?<br />Wir würden gerne einen Videobeitrag zum Deepweb machen.<br />Ähnlich wie z.B. das Drogen-Video von unseren Kollegen aus UK:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvN7fKmCoXA<br /><br />Das ganze würde natürlich vollkommen Annonym stattfinden. Wir haben viel Erfahrung mit sensiblen Produktionen und können sicher stellen, dass deine Identität auf keinen Fall bekannt wird. Gerne kannst du dich uns auch nur Vermummt zeigen bzw. würden wir den Film sowieso zur Unkenntlichkeit verpixeln und deine Stimme verzerren.<br /><br />Wir würden dir in dem Fall, dass du dich mit uns triffst und uns ein Interview gibst, auch Geld dafür anbieten.<br /><br />Wir würden dir im Vorfeld natürlich alle nötigen Beweise schicken bzw. erbringen damit du dir sicher sein kannst, dass wir wirklich Journalisten von VICE sind und nicht die Polizei die dich verarschen will. Gerne auch jede Art von Überprüfung die du dir einfallen lässt! Wir möchten, dass du dich sicher fühlst, wenn du dich mit uns treffen würdest.<br /><br />Yours<br />VICE<br /><br /><br />Translate English<br /><br /><br />I write for VICE Germany. (vice.com)<br />I have seen that you are a reliable Verkläufer from Germany here at SilkRoad.<br /><br />I wanted to ask if you would give us an interview?<br />We would like to make a contribution to DeepWeb video.<br />Similarly, such as the drug video of our colleagues from the UK:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvN7fKmCoXA<br /><br />The whole place would of course completely annonym. We have much experience with sensitive productions and can ensure that your identity is known in any case. Feel free to disguise yourself and just show us anyway and we would pixelate the film beyond recognition and distort your voice.<br /><br />We would be you., In the case that you meet with us and give us an interview, also offer money for it<br /><br />We would of course send you in advance and provide all necessary evidence so that you know for sure that we are really journalists from VICE and not trying to cheat the police yourself. And often in any kind of review you can think of you! We want you to feel safe when you would meet with us.<br /><br />Yours<br />VICE<br /><br /><br />What do you guys thinking about this?<br /><br /><br />..<br />My answer:<br /><br />Sorry but we don&#039;t reveal anything what comes around and goes around trought the Darknet.<br />It&#039;s totally a stupid idea for showing this for public. It&#039;s must stay underground<br /><br /><br />

				Don&#039;t talk to the media. Vice also cannot be trusted with sensitive information. Here is why:<br /><br />Vice editor Rocco Castoro wrote an article about six months ago about John McAfee on the run for murder in Central America. He took a photo of the two with his iPhone. He then preceded to post that photo with the article on Vice.com. Obviously, the metadata revealed the exact GPS coordinates of the photo, and thus the fugitive that was the subject of the article. To be a head editor of something&quot;journalistic&quot; and not know these kind of things is down right dangerous to your sources. <br /><br />They don&#039;t deserve to be called journalists. Vice is full of a bunch of hipsters that are just glorified bloggers, that every once in awhile post cool videos. I wouldn&#039;t trust them with my freedom.&nbsp; &nbsp;

I&#039;ve watched the shows on HBO and just about every one of them I think to myself that they&#039;re being dishonest about one aspect or another. Then shortly after there was a bunch of news/editorials about Shane Smith (founder/owner of vice) being an egomaniac and willing to lie about anything to make money. Go figure.

				I think there has been enough publicity in the mainstream media, and elsewhere easily accessible online, that made the Silk Road known as a concept and working possibility. The only thing that hasn&#039;t really been well publicized since the first initial articles are that fair prices, high quality, good service, and selection are all abound on the site. And they may beat what you can find on the street, depending on where you live and who you know. In my view, vendors shouldn&#039;t be worrying about more publicity to increase sales. The access to far more people via the internet than one could reasonably have in their own circle of friends, or network of customers, should be enough to make any good business thrive.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know why people here are so hostile to the idea of giving a 1 on 1, encrypted interview to Vice. If anything, that&#039;s the first place I&#039;d go to be interviewed myself. Yes, they make mistakes sometimes. So do other very well known reporters some of whom have taken home Pulitzers. Just make sure that if you do agree to an interview that you don&#039;t give away any personally identifying or specific geographical location info. Otherwise you should be alright.<br /><br />Like it or not, SOMEONE on SR will agree to an interview with the media. Might as well be with Vice giving a proper perspective on what really goes on here. After all the fucking nonsense that&#039;s come out about SR online it would be good to see a truthful account for once. If anything just because prohibition has to be shown to be the oppressive, bullshit regime that it really is. Someone has to call it out and there&#039;s no better place to make that happen than here.

				How to become a vice journalist:<br /><br />1. Wear a stupid hat<br />2. Own a fixie bike<br />3. Continually expose things that it is morally wrong to expose if you&#039;re a believer in said cause, while pretending to be a believer in said cause.

				In general I feel like any extra publicity for the road is generally a bad thing. I am not a vendor so I guess biased in that regard but I would think the bigger it gets the harder it becomes to tolerate for international LE. If it stays at nuisance level thats probably a good thing but if it really becomes the &quot;Amazon&quot; of drugs they will deal with it and the politicians will start with their press conferences again.

				In a sentence, I personally think that allowing any outsider journalist (or claim to be journalist), no matter who good their intentions may be, would bring nothing good to the SR Community, but has a lot of potential to bring harm or even disaster to to the Community. <br /><br />Actually, I think that patswin explained much of this concept very well:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=193332.msg1398598#msg1398598">Quote from: patswin on July 31, 2013, 09:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In general I feel like any extra publicity for the road is generally a bad thing.

The positive side though is that much like the revelations made by Edward Snowden, most (possibly all) of what he said is and has been for years also out there for anyone who cares to look to have found out on their own, but the vast majority of people never bothered to look - they figure that what seems to pass for &quot;news&quot; on the mainstream media IS The News, the Whole News and Nothing But the News. It was only when Snowden brought the information to the mainstream media, that the majority of the public even became aware of any of it.&nbsp; And, while we here are naturally much more tuned in to noticing all the clearnet websites, articles, blogs, etc...&nbsp; that for some of us make it seem as if the SR is widely publicized.&nbsp; So far, I&#039;ve not personally seen/heard mention of it on any mainstream news outlets.&nbsp; I would guess that there probably has been a few menitons of SR in mainstream media as I don&#039;t watch it 24/7... but if there has been, it has probably been brief and with little real detail as it hasn&#039;t ellicited much of a public outcry.&nbsp; But I have to agree that if people start volintarily giving interviews, participating in video documentaries, etc..&nbsp; no matter how well they conceal thier identities and locations, eventually a YouTube Video or similar will come to the attention of some mainstream TV journalist looking for a sensational story, and if they work for CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc..&nbsp; and/or their broadcast counterparts... well, that could really be a major problem.&nbsp; Enough said.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=193332.msg1395000#msg1395000">Quote from: astor on July 30, 2013, 09:54 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fuck these journalists.
