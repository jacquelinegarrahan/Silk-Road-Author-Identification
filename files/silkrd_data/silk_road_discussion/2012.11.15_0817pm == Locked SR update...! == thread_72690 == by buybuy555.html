				hey fellow roadsters,<br /><br />i have created and locked&nbsp; this thread, to post any official updates from DPR or Inigo i may come across, because im tired of reading all the BS posted on the official update thread by the conspiracy trolls during these dark hours, even tho it may be entertaining from time to time...<br /><br />heres hoping things will be back to normal as soon as possible, and big up DPR, Inigo and all the mods for what they have achieved and are striving to acomplish...<br /><br />keep an eye on this thread for updates as they come...<br /><br />long live SR...

				*****latest statement from DPR*****<br /><br />&quot;hmm... site went down again, but we have it back up.&nbsp; rumors of hackers floating around.&nbsp; give me some time to assess the situation and get reports from my staff and I&#039;ll have a public statement ready asap.&quot;<br /><br />UPDATE (2254 UTC 11/15/2012): The site went down again and there are people claiming to be responsible for it and making threats.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to take any chances, so the site is going to come down for a bit while we investigate what is going on.&nbsp; Hopefully this is short lived... what drama!&nbsp; Next update will come before 0600 UTC.<br /><br />UPDATE (2326 UTC 11/15/2012): Might not have to take the site down after all.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you know here if we do.&nbsp; A side note about withdrawals:&nbsp; There have been a ton of them (understandable), so we are getting through them as fast as possible.&nbsp; Please be patient if we haven&#039;t gotten to yours yet.<br /><br />UPDATE (0225 UTC 11/16/2012): Withdrawals are up to date, so if you sent a withdrawal and it is taking much longer than usual to show up, please contact support so we can investigate.&nbsp; Still a few things to iron out with the site (people getting logged off, etc), but I think we are just about there.<br /><br /><br /><br />
