				Yeah, newcomers should probably know about that whole thing. I, like many buyers, got suckered in and lost a bit of money. Luckily it was only a couple hundred for me, but still, that hurt.<br /><br />For those who don&#039;t know what the Tony thing is, Tony76 was the #1 vendor on the Silk Road. He had spent months building up his reputation. On 4/20, he offered a huge sale, but only if his buyers finalized early so that he could handle the large quantity of orders. A ton of people trusted him and chose to finalize early, and he never came back... Do NOT finalize early, not for any sale, and not for any vendor, no matter how big. Learn from the mistakes of those before you.

				Yeah, I remember Tony. He&#039;s right up there on the list of the top Bitcoin Bandits. Speculation was abound as to how much he made in that scam and people were talking $30+<br /><br />If he kept those coins with the way the exchange rate has exploded since 4/20/12, he&#039;s well on his way to retirement, lol
