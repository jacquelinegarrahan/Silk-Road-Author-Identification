				Put a link to the wiki on the footer of the main site next to &#039;Contact Us&#039; so more people know the wiki exists. There&#039;s lots of useful information in there.

				Excellent work guys! As someone who got phished when I was a brand new member, I would love to see some &quot;Newbie Startup Guide&quot; type thing that gives you step by step instructions on getting set up on linux/debian/freebsd/whatever on a livekey and getting tor working on that live setup, maybe something about setting up torchat in a live enviro, etc.<br /><br />Again, this is a great addition to the community!<br /><br />(I agree I&#039;d like to see a link on the main page)

				Any chance you could add wiki articles about different drugs, like a community-edited version of erowid? Just a thought, I know I&#039;ve seen some instances on Erowid where it&#039;d be nice to add some information for the benefit of others.

				the whole idea of the wiki is to get as much information on there as we can. so, when you go into the search bar and type &quot;coke&quot; you will have a plethera of information.<br /><br />Sorry that there isn&#039;t a whole lot of info. It took me a long time to get to this point. I had to learn from scratch on how to use the wiki, I watched countelsss how to youtube videos. the wiki program that we are using is just out of beta. so it isn&#039;t like a drag and drop program. you have to know their codes to do a lot of it. <br /><br />Plus, I started the project when there were major issues with tor and I could log in about 10 percent of the time. it was a messy start. Then Digitalch volunteered and helped clean it up and gave some great advice. This has been a great learning experience for me and im glad I took it on.<br /><br />We will only give log in capabilites to those that are willing to help add and actually edit. As you will see, a lot of the pages that were done need some cleaning up. I am not a writer. If you want to write pages, hit me up and ill give you some pointers on how to make the page have catagories, etc. or you can google our wiki and learn on your own.. But, I think its a great wiki. <br /><br />When you get an account you can have basically your own page, its not private by anymeans, anyone can edit it, etc. but its a great way to write your material and get all looking good in the wiki format and then copy and paste it to the new page that you want to create. I gave some tips on the front page. So that will help a&nbsp; lot. Under the major sections on the home page, we cant put every page there. that will be saved for the top 20 to 30 catagories. maybe a more, its meant to use the search button.<br /><br />If you have any questions hit me up. <br /><br />The other admins are digitalalch and captainjojo, their job isnt only to write and edit but to keep an eye on things and to help out (until they say they dont want to, lol) but I want to thank them for their help and support...<br /><br />I think this will be a valuable asset to the Silk Road community. BTW, the market does have a link saying that we have a wiki, not sure if they put a direct link to it yet, like they did with the forum...<br /><br />Let me know how it can be improved and such, Im all open for suggestions.. Ill be out of commission for&nbsp; a few days, but i hope to be back by monday at the latest, maybe sooner..<br /><br />take care..<br />cp

				Chronic - I sent you a (forum) PM this morning with a coded (wiki markup) and reworked FAQ page.&nbsp; Hopefully it came through.&nbsp; I added a few questions and rearranged it a (good) bit.&nbsp; You might want to copy/paste it into notepad to remove any extraneous code the forum messaging system might have added to it before you paste it into the wiki (assuming you want to use it, that is).&nbsp; Please let me know if you didn&#039;t get it...

I think (at least for the moment) its a good idea to keep it the way that it is, then see where it goes from there) the wiki is pretty cool, each person could have their own page and its own discussion page as well. It would be a great place for vendors having their own page and then on the discussion page buyers, etc can talk about that vendor. Kind of like the forum, but you can keep talking about the vendor without the thread going down a million pages..
