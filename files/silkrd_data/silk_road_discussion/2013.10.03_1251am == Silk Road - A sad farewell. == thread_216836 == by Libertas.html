			<dd class="postbody">
				Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters in arms,<br /><br />It is with a heavy heart that I come before you today. A heart filled with sadness for the infringements of our freedoms by government oppressors, and a heart filled with sadness for the pain that all of you whom have lost everything are feeling.<br /><br />Silk Road has fallen.<br /><br />Whilst this is devastating to me personally on so many levels, and I will not be commenting on the arrest of any person portrayed by the media as &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot;, it serves to strengthen my resolve to fighting the hands of Law Enforcement that are committed to strangling personal freedom from our bodies, demonstrating a lack of conscience and justice on their part in the process. They will stop at nothing to enforce the unjust laws created and maintained by the societal and governmental framework within which they operate, and the actions of one persona, the Dread Pirate Roberts, has managed to stymie their efforts for two and a half years.<br /><br />Think about that for a moment.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts - as a persona - has singlehandedly kept world governments at bay for two and a half years. This idea that this one entity can successfully thwart the phenomenal resources and bloodthirsty power of numerous governments for so long is something that should be taken to heart, and never forgotten. We have the power to fight these agents of oppression, to fight the governments that task them with that oppression, and with the fires that Silk Road has stoked in our hearts and minds we must do just that.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts has shown that free people can engage in consensual free-market transactions for any good or service that they desire without societal or community breakdown, nor the need for enforcement from jackbooted thugs. Silk Road as an experiment has shown that the idea of the free-market is one that works, and works exceptionally well.<br /><br />We must stand on the shoulders of this tragedy that has befallen us and raise high what still remains - our sense of community, freedom and justice. No doubt we will all regroup elsewhere, and I look forward to seeing all of you again, still free and still engaging in free trade without government interference into your personal affairs.<br /><br />Whilst Silk Road may have fallen, its spirit will spring eternal. The spirit of this community that has inspired and helped so many will continue to live on regardless of what governments wish to say about it. It has been an absolute pleasure serving and working with all of you, and I sincerely wish you all the best for the future wherever you choose to go.<br /><br />The Dread Pirate Roberts is a revolutionary, a comrade in arms and a true hero who will live on as such in our hearts and minds without fail for as long as we breathe. His ideals and sacrifices will never be forgotten, and they will spur the next generation of revolutionaries into action against oppression.<br /><br />To the members of Law Enforcement that are no doubt reading this, many of you may have received pats on the back and &quot;high-fives&quot; from your peers. You may feel good now, ecstatic even, but I urge you to consider the effects of your actions. You are going to see more bloodshed on our streets (note &quot;our&quot;, not &quot;your&quot;, for those streets belong to the people), and more dealer on buyer violence as free people that wish to engage in activities that harm none are forced to return to their previous methods of securing the goods that they wish to put into their own bodies. That blood is now on your hands, and the hands of the politicians that you live to serve and serve to live. I pity you, for as long as you live to serve you will never know freedom.<br /><br />To the community at large, you have been nothing short of incredible. Keep fighting the good fight, and never let they who are bound by the chains of law tell you that you are not permitted to be free simply because they are shackled themselves. Governments tells us that we are free but the reality is that the moment we are born we are shackled by the rule of law. Government has no place in a free society, and we need to make sure that they who deem it their right to take away the natural rights of others as free beings are made fully aware of that.<br /><br />Take the fight wherever it is needed, and support every effort to take your government down. You are justified in those actions as they would not hesitate to take you down for standing up for your freedom.<br /><br />&quot;Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.&quot;<br />- Martin Luther King Jr.<br /><br />It has been an honor and a privilege to be part of something so incredible with all of you.<br /><br />Until we meet again, brothers and sisters.<br /><br />Libertas

There are plenty of offshore VPS providers that accept bitcoin and total anonymity. I guess he and most of us just neglected the human element. Tor is a great system but in the end he left quite a huge trail (understandable since in 2000 - 2001 he was lacking the technical knowledge to pull this off).

				Respect Sir and we have all enjoyed the ride with you. <br /><br />Please do what you can to put in motion any kind of backup of the forums. Somebody that can needs to follow through with this. A simple archive of the forums can be made very easily and re-hosted on a dozen different onion sites in a few hours.

				Of course the government doesn&#039;t want a fully functioning drug market online. Not to &quot;protect the public&quot;, but to push individuals to the street, to consume impure products, where violence is common.Doesn&#039;t everyone see, it fits the government narrative, that drug users are evil, violent psychopaths; when in reality it is the individuals, who enforce arcane morality laws who are sinister.Allowing pure drugs to be sold only saves people. The problem with most overdoses are adulterated or counterfeit substances. This market along with the many contributors, highlights how a true free market can operate. It shows that humans really can work together, to form a functioning system without overbearing state influence. I hope everyone keeps sailing...

Chuck Shumer are happy, sick fuckers.&nbsp; <br />How many kids will OD on bad molly because of you and your selfish pigs?<br />All you have to look at is Hank Schrader and Mike Gomez on Breaking Bad to see<br />what a lost cause this is on your part, you discourage harm reduction, fail to warn the<br />public when tainted and poisonous drugs come into circulation. keep users from being<br />able to legally test what they put in their bodies, and for what- for a mistake Nixon made<br />back in 1970, when he declared War on Drugs, to stop the New Left and the anti-war effort.<br />The real Kingpin- the head of the Sinaloa cartel, along with the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas,<br />are chilling in their haciendas, doing more business than silk road did in a year, in less than a<br />week, killing over 120,000 Mexicans, mostly civilians.&nbsp; Thats TWO Vietnam wars for a country<br />smaller than the US.&nbsp; These mass murderers, who own private armies are treated better than<br />a man who simply set up a marketplace for the safe, free exchange of psychotropics(mostly weed<br />and psychedelics) because drug users are sick of being shot at, robbed, raped, imprisoned, by gangs, and<br />tortured by police.&nbsp; &nbsp;We will come back stronger, just like the three little pigs, SR v1.0 might have been<br />built of straw, but the next iteration will be sticks, and when you blow down the stick house, the<br />next one will be bricks.&nbsp; The next one after that, if you get that far, will be made of reactive armor and<br />10m thick titanium under half a kilometer of sand.&nbsp; You will curse this day, when you could have done<br />honest police work and busted some dealers on a fucking open non-invite site.&nbsp; Next time, it will<br />be harder, I assure you.&nbsp; Global connections have been made, ideas have spread, and soon governments<br />will fear their people more than people fear their government(or what is left of it.)&nbsp; Your choosing<br />of this day, with all of the media coverage of the shutdown was a smokescreen, to take away from<br />the fact that YOU the government, and your wealthy benefactors, profit more from illegal drugs<br />than all the dealers combined.&nbsp; Want proof? a low-level drug user/dealer costs $30-40k to keep in <br />prison per year, 99% of SR users on here for 2 years haven&#039;t even spent that much money, so<br />it is obvious that the government has nothing but blood on its hands, bloody money.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Every drug related death that could have been prevented by good practices and safe gear is now<br />YOUR fault, because it could have been prevented.&nbsp; Oh yeah, while you were busting this site,<br />100 metric tonnes of Spice and other unsafe, untested drugs were imported from China right under<br />your nose.&nbsp; You weren&#039;t on watch, I guess, so its your fault.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FUCK OFF, DEA!!!!&nbsp; Your misdeeds will catch up with you, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; do you really want an entire generation angry with you? you&#039;ve done it.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not going to do anything radical or violent, and I don&#039;t suggest anyone else do that. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would ideally like to see some kind of silent/anonymous protest, like stickers on<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; various public places, that say &quot;THE DEA KILLS KIDS.&quot; and &quot;WE WARNED YOU.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WHo is with me?

				Libertas,<br /><br />Can you shed any light on whether or not someone(feds) having access to the server means they can see all processing orders? If someone had their address unencrypted could they see it, or would they have to go through to each individual user and look at their orders? Can they also easily see all of the collective individual user wallets on the server?

				I knew i should have taken advantage of the site while I still could. But instead i decided on waiting on new listings and lost $80. But it was nice being able to be part of the community and use the road. Im going onto Black market for now but hopefully another version of silkroad come back. Also I heard DPR is not the actual founder of Silkroad but he bought it or something from the first owner? And also His account was logged into today not long ago. And also I agree with the post above me, SR still has the power to be rebuilt.<br /><br />&nbsp;DRP messed up while using his marketing tactics which lead to his gmail being found by the fbi. It was something that nobody could have seen coming but atleast a lesson was learned from it if anyone would ever want to be his predecessor

There have to be lawyers, predecessors, almost cartel like business figures who are in the waiting and plans made to keep this place going? There is too much money at stake to just let it die! How did they even get on the site? So they caught him and he gave over all passwords and security details, personal wallet info etc within 1 day?

				Oh Libertas darling, that post made me cry a bit. I just recently woke up - after taking some valium and trying to sleep on this news for an hour or two -&nbsp; with that sinking feeling of &quot;FUCK THAT REALLY HAPPENED&quot; you get when a loved one dies. <br /><br />BUT the idea of Silk Road will never die. This site has set the wheels in motion for the way things will be at some point in the future when prohibition and constraints on personal freedom are a quaint thing of the past. <br /><br />As for the individual they claim is DPR who is currently in custody, well, he if it IS him, he said recently that he has already meditated on the fact that he could well spend the rest of his life is prison. I&#039;m not saying that makes it alright that he&#039;s incarcerated (it breaks my heart) but he&#039;ll work out, read, write, play ping pong and get into his beloved painting and drawing without the tremendous stress of looking over his shoulder all day every day without being able to talk to anyone in RL about it all.<br /><br />I believe the stress of running SR got to one so young and highly intelligent -&nbsp; a self-admitted pot smoking hippy &#039;softy&#039; - and on some level it&#039;ll be a relief knowing this is all out there now. I think perhaps too he knew we&#039;d all reconvene elsewhere should the worst happen and the ideals he has woken us ALL up to will never die. <br /><br />Also: Just think- so many people who never knew about Silk Road before GLOBALLY will see the publicity surrounding the case and his ideals will reach so many more people understanding to the revolution - millions more than just the several thousand or so people who wanted to score drugs off the internet.<br /><br />Someone who knew him personally posted this to reddit - it made me smile :<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t feel it&#039;s best for anyone to speculate about the allegations, so I won&#039;t.<br /><br />He was a physics major when I knew him (2002-2006) although we lost touch after college and he moved out of Dallas back to Austin. The kind of guy who&#039;d walk around campus barefoot and shirtless wearing a camelbak in the middle of summer.<br /><br />I met him at college orientation, and got to know him really well through a mutual friend, we&#039;d work out daily at 6AM together. Ross was a total hippie and never wore deodorant. I never said anything but I HATED having him as a spotter because he smelled.<br /><br />Seriously though, he is utterly brilliant. You know how people in college like to think they&#039;re being all intellectual and have &quot;deep&quot; conversations? Well, Ross was for real. He&#039;d lose everyone in the conversation after a few minutes, he was just thinking through things at a level so profoundly different than the rest of us.<br /><br />Great artist as well, he had an incredible notebook full of amazing sketches. Lots of his own art up on the walls too.<br /><br />He taught me how to meditate, specifically a method I could use to get help get rid of headaches.<br /><br />But honestly, most of the time I spent with him was just hanging out in the on-campus apartments, eating pizza and playing video games. Just like any other college student. That&#039;s why all this feels so unreal.<br /><br />I actually just posted to his Facebook wall, but I don&#039;t expect he&#039;ll be able to see it.<br /><br />Edited to add: he always kicked my ass at ping pong too.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Clearnet link to screencaps of &quot;alleged&quot; DPR&#039;s facebook with his art etc http://imgur.com/a/RlQH5<br /><br /><br />Gone for now, but not forgotten........Viva the revolution baby.<br /><br />Stay safe, Lib. Much love, thanks and positive vibes your and the other mods&#039; way xo<br /><br />

				Great post Libertas. I will say that I believe in government, I simply think that our laws regarding drugs is shit. But hardcore libertarians types are the ones who worked hardest on making SR what it was.<br /><br />As I read posts like this I&#039;m always in awe of how intellectual the leadership and most SR users are. Just fucking look at us compared to street dealers! I spent a while dealing with some real pieces of shit when I went on my journey of understanding the street dealing world and dealing with those schmucks fuckin&#039; sucks. But look at what us nerds have made here! Any fucking drug you want any fucking where you want. It&#039;s not crazy to predict that a large part of drug dealing in the future will be controlled by nerds.<br /><br />SR GOING DOWN AIN&#039;T SHIT! WE WILL MOVE ON COMRADES! BMR and Sheep are already loadin&#039; up. Internet drug trafficking is here to stay.

				It truly has been an honor. I hope to see some of you flexing your freedoms and buying from us and other wonderful vendors on the Silk Road alternatives. I hope this isn&#039;t the last we&#039;ll see of Dread Pirate Roberts. The one we have come to know is gone, but I pray that another individual will take up the throne.

				I believe they targeted the silk road for the fact that, despite its minor problems, The Silk Road displayed proof contrary to the propaganda the government uses to fuel the drug wars. The Silk Road was a success ,and that is a threat to the governments tenuous grip on power which is maintained through the manipulation of perceptions. If they are declaring that drugs and drug dealers cannot be allowed to operate because of the danger that they pose to the public the model provided by The Silk Road is compelling evidence to counter their arguments, minus any &quot;murder for hire&quot; plot if in fact there was any, which sadly happens in all facets of life and one needs to look no further than government and corporations for the very proof of that.<br /><br />Spoken beautifully Libertas! <br /><br />As a community we must always remember that united we shall stand, but if we allow ourselves to be divided then we allow ourselves to be defeated.

				Well friends, we all knew this day may come, that being said, I had no idea how profoundly I would be affected. I must say, the sadness in my heart is close to the grief of losing a loved one. Instead of wallowing in misery, I have decided to reflect upon all of the joy that SR brought to my life and I can&#039;t help but feel a deep sense of gratitude to DPR and his staff for risking their very freedom, to truly empower the disenfranchised. Through the use of hallucinogens procured from SR, my wife and I have fallen back in love, I have faced and defeated many personal demons, I have mended many relationships in my life, I have came very close to self actualization, but most importantly, I was awakened from my slumber and reminded that I was worried about all the wrong things. I love all of you and I pray that we will find a way to carry on this dream. Godspeed, and I will see you all on the other side.

				Libertas, that was extremely well put.<br /><br />My impression from reading DPR&#039;s posts -- the FBI&#039;s claims notwithstanding -- is that there was a solid philosophical understanding underlying this SR operation. Whatever direction we go from here, it should be rooted in the same kind of true understanding, free from the illusions of this pathological system of control that we live under This may be the end of a legend, but DPR&#039;s legacy lives on within each and every one of us who benefited from his deeds.<br />

				&quot;Silk Road as an experiment has shown that the idea of the free-market is one that works, and works exceptionally well.&quot;<br /><br />Thats my favorite part. <br /><br />I have not purchased for a long time but it was nice to know I could get what I want when I want, SR took the power away from all those dodgy street dealers, it took the shine away. Drugs being so easy to get via SR made me want them less because they were always there, if somethings hard to get you will want it more. It was nothing but a good thing for me, everything about it. Ticked a few fuckin boxes in my life aswel. <br /><br />The majority of us here are out to harm nobody just enjoy ourselves, we are not bad people, which is reflected in the free-market being a success.<br /><br />Love to you all, see you around.<br /><br /><br />

				i hope the person accused will receive millions and millions of annon. letters to keep them busy. its a sad thing to think about like what if in 2-3 years hes forgotten about and dont even have enough money on his books to buy a honeybun? we gotta keep track of how this plays out and remember this person accused may spend the rest of his life in a cage for helping further our freedom. i wish shit went different and his face was on a 100.00 dollar bill instead of the news. i also wish that it would look like michael jacksons court date and millions of supporters flood the courthouse and blocks around. and it needs to be looked into how to get money annon. to his books so he can eat sum snacks at the least. i also wish that in prison he gets treated with the respect he deserves, to bad we cant arrange some protection for him inside. and also i wish we would come together as a community and rebuild because we cant let his life be wasted for a few years of and not let the idea live. too bad if its not already in place that some annon. donors get the best leagl defense in the country like a team of sharks ass lawyers take it to trial and what if most of the jurors were SR users? i hope the person accused atleast isnt forgot about and gets some support so he dont feel all his efforts were in vain. did he fuck up sum? yep. im sure most of us have were just not under the same scope as he was. anyways its been great im so glad i was a part of this and look forward to being a part of the rebuilding.

				Wonderful insightful words Libertas.<br /><br />To echo your words I feel exactly the same as you in that I have felt honored and privileged to have been of service to this amazing community.<br /><br />We have choice in front of us now, we need to regroup and find a new home. There is no knowing how long these forums will stay up for, they are undoubtedly in the hands of LE now and even though I thought I had posted my final post yesterday here I am again, inextricably drawn back to the place that I love, I really cannot imagine my life without being a part of this community even if my partner is looking forward to having some more SSBD time not glued to the fucking laptop.<br /><br />I hope everyone is taking the appropriate precautions, I sincerely doubt LE will go after the small time buyers but it is always good to be cautious, plan for the worst and hope for the best.<br /><br />I spent most of yesterday cleaning house, I even think a holiday might be called for because there is no knowing what LE will do, whether they will consider a forum moderator a high class target or not I don&#039;t know but I have to consider my options.<br /><br />I have signed a post with my PGP in the thread StExo created, if you read any uncharacteristic posts from this account you should request they sign it because it might not be me. I am sure LE once they have finished congratulating themselves on regressing drug law and harm reduction by a decade they could conceivably come here to try to cause the community to fracture ti disrupt us regrouping.<br /><br />This is not the end, SR was just the beginning.<br /><br />ssbd<br /><br /><br /><br />

				maybe someone should come up with a .onion encrypted site where you can conduct transactions in escrow whatever it may be, drugs, tobacco, software, miscellaneous goods (basically the same shit you could get on sr..). no hitman shit, no cp, no weapons, and everything that could shut it down. this way there wont be drugs on the main site haha, itd be a bit harder to take down no? kinda the same escrow lay out as SR...you sign up with a username and that account will have a btc wallet where you can transfer funds to the member you conduct biz with. when it comes you release funds, same shit as sr but no blatant drug shit yknowmsayin? someone with the money should prolly do this and put the servers off shore somewhere where its cool and wont rat you out. and please be discreet never leave your tracks when using clearnet..change up your usernames, your email address, everything dont use the same shit like &quot;altoid&quot; dont do that, to the guy who might do somethin like this. i dont think its a bad idea tho...i will miss sr and i dont think this is over, when a door closes a window will open. but seriously tho this hurts more than any break up ever, those were just bitches...this was somethin else<br /><br /><br />*also, in addition to the proposed&quot; anonymous escrow marketplace&quot; (if you can call it that, sorry am a bit high) i mentioned above there should be a forum type layout .onion site where people sign up as a customer or vendor (vendor pays a one time $80 fee) and people can browse and see whos got what for sale. different sections for different types of merchandise of course and vendors are limited to posting one new &quot;thread&quot; every 4-5 hours. in the thread people can ask questions and if you click on the vendors profile and on there, you can read and leave feedback on em as well as read their terms and conditions and see what theyve gott for sale. so that way you can get a feel of them and see if they worthy of doing biz with...you can go to a customers page and the more referrals the customer gets, the more trusted they should be considered...the site should have a pm feature and everyone should use pgp of course, from there people exchange their btc wallet address ID thru messages and then go to the other site i proposed and carry out the transaction like on sr..this all of course on safe off shore servers. of course the forum should have a discussion section and there you would have the same SR forum sections...trouble shooting, rumor mill, etc. i think this should be pretty safe no? or at least work for a while if executed properly by the right person with the right team of mods or what have you. we have a good community fuck all the scammers but to the people who did good and always pulled thru whether it was you finalizing or you shippin the right amount we did good, where we go we gotta stick together man or at least try our damn hardest. this was life changing, it would be devastating to let this fade into nothing

				Great post. It&#039;s so sad to see such a good service come to an end. Now instead of people getting good, safe stuff. They will flock to the streets and get that dirty, unsafe, cut stuff. I know LE doesn&#039;t really care about that. But that was one major pro with a site like SR. You were getting pretty clean, consistent stuff. Away from the public. Doing your stuff safe at home. You&#039;d never hear a story on the news about how someone OD&#039;ed or went psycho in public from stuff they got on this site. The users were pretty responsible. I don&#039;t really know what it is they feel they accomplished with this bust since I don&#039;t think they are going after the sellers. Another 1 or 2 will take it&#039;s place by the end of the month. This drug war is a joke.

				Interesting times indeed.&nbsp; It was grand while it lasted.&nbsp; Who knows where we will all be in 6-12 months?&nbsp; We are only underdogs now, and a resurgence is possible and probably likely.&nbsp; <br /><br />My tinfoil hat finds it very interesting that this coincided with:<br /><br />Federal govt shutdown<br />Debt ceiling drama<br />Upcoming elections<br />Breaking Bad conclusion (relatively high profile in pop culture)<br /><br />I think the above have possible implications for both BTC/USD and usual gangster state propaganda.<br /><br />Lay low and beware of honeytrap alternatives.<br /><br />Ideally the next step would be a TOR/PGP based meetup network for IRL connections but who knows how that could work with confidence in security.<br /><br />Fuck the gangster state.<br /><br />Stay smart, stay safe, and lay low.&nbsp; Take a break.&nbsp; If you are seriously hurting go cold cop.&nbsp; Don&#039;t fall for &quot;SR alternatives&quot; until they have a track record.&nbsp; It sounds crazy to say but I would say cold copping right now is much less risky than signing up to a supposed &quot;SR alternative&quot;.<br /><br />Bravo to all who risked their freedom to make SR a real thing.

				I couldn&#039;t believe it when I first arrived at the site a couple of years ago.<br />The idea that you could order the best hash from all round the globe, stuff I hadn&#039;t smoked in 20years, was just fantastic.<br />I will miss this site massively&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe SR has gone<br /><br />:(

Unless SR is a huge controversy in your area and LE would be interested in making an example of youj to prove a point, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. LE usually doesn&#039;t bother with small-time buyers; they find sellers and redistributors MUCH more interesting than those buying for personal use.<br /><br />Party on Wayne!
