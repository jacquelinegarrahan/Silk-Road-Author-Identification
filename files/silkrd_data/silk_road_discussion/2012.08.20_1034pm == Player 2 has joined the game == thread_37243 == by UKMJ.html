				Hi Guys,<br /><br />Been lurking here for quite a while and finally feel comfortable enough with the technological requirements to start vending. Not going to spam this everywhere so I have just made a post to the product offers thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=37241.0<br /><br />But as I spend an inordinate amount of time in this thread (no where near as much as Lim, but then again who does?!) I thought I would just let you know.<br /><br />Looking forward to it.
