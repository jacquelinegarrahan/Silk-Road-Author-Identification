				There are currently no US-gov ensured Bitcoin services.&nbsp; There will be shortly: CoinLab is taking over MtGox and they&#039;ll basically be a bank or... some such thing.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; If you&#039;re really that worried about theft, you&#039;ll just have to wait.<br /><br />The most reliable wallet service is the one you run and secure yourself.&nbsp; Nobody looks after your own interests like you.<br />

				In 2010 a Bitcoin wallet got hacked into and a man lost 25,000 Bitcoins approximately $500,000 in Bitcoins in value in an unencrypted wallet, very sad for him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;How do you feel about Coinbase.com wallet?

				Coinbase?&nbsp; ... are you asking for my personal appraisal, or for my unbiased one?&nbsp; My unbiased one is that their business model may not hold up long term, but they&#039;re fine at the moment.&nbsp; Continuing to grow pretty quickly.<br /><br />As for security of funds in their accounts?&nbsp; They&#039;re... so-so.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t want to have money there if I knew someone who truly knows what they&#039;re doing was targeting them.&nbsp; Short of that, they&#039;re fine.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak to their services, as I&#039;m not a customer of theirs.

				But if I run into any security problems I will try to search for a more secure website.&nbsp; What do you feel the most secure website is at this time?

				I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;re so intent on someone else holding your bitcoins for you.&nbsp; That is what a wallet service is.&nbsp; You can easily do it locally, and it&#039;s then as secure as the backup of your wallet.dat file is.<br /><br />Personally there are no wallet services I actually trust enough to let them keep my money.&nbsp; Blockchain.info is supposed to be pretty secure though.<br />

				Move your coins to a virtual wallet, you cannot trust others to hold your valuables.

				Use electrum, no need to download the blockchain and your wallet can be destroyed and ressurrected using a seed passphrase (though its better to just encrypt the damn thing).
