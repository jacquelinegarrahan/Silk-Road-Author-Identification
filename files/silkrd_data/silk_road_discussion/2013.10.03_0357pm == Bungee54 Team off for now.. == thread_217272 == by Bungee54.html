				We are on the move to another country and also we need some sleep after 30 hours continues planing and being glued to the screen..<br /><br /><br />lot&#039;s of talents messaged us and we are at a point where we can take off for a few hours without total fear that this forum will not be there any longer when we come back!<br /><br /><br />even if ..the groundwork in networking is laid and we are sure there will already be more famous things up when we are back..<br /><br />what a great reason to get some sleep *g*<br /><br /><br />if it is not online anymore then we wish &quot; all the best with your plans ! Stay safe ! Fuck the Police !&quot;<br /><br />See you on the other side !!!<br /><br />

				Good luck!<br />It is very encouraging to see most vendors moving to other sites as well as a lot of talk about additional sites opening up.<br />I lost a lot of money from Silk Road being shut down, but I think that many, many good things will come from this.<br />It will only get better.
