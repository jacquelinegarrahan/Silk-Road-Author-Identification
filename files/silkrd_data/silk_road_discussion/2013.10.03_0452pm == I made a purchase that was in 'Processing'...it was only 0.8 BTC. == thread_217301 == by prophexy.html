				This is a VERY RETARDED question.&nbsp; Is there a way to get that money back, since OBVIOUSLY the order was not shipped?

				No. The vendor you bought from probably lost tens of thousands if not more and you want your .8 back.. Your only bet is asking him on the forums or another market but that most likely will not end well. It&#039;s pretty common understanding now that this loss is mutual. We all loose money, product, etc... Most vendors are leaving the orders they shipped in transit and that&#039;s that. The vendor did not get your money. No more going out, no refunds, maybe a discount for people who ordered that did not receive, but that&#039;s it. We have yet to have 1 person to ask us expecting product or a refund though.

				I lost over 2000btc.&nbsp; The 26k seized cannot be everything that was on Silk Road.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think we are getting anything back though.

				Its impossible. Even if they only got the escrow account, it still does not add up. Any vendor that makes even a half decent amount of sales (which is many) had to have atleast 8-20k in escrow. plus whatever they did not cash out from the available funds which could be from 1000 to 10,000 if people were as dumb as we were on that note.
