				I need to get around $3,500 worth of bitcoins, and preferably sooner rather than later.&nbsp; I normally use MtGox and bitinstant, but am weary of using MtGox with this amount of money.&nbsp; I&#039;ve considered doing bitinstant to a bitcoin address and then doing a few transfers before transfering to my SR account, with this it would still take 2-3 days as I can only do $1,000 per bank deposit.&nbsp; Would a $1,000 bank deposit raise any flags?&nbsp; Any suggestions on other routes?&nbsp; Thanks

				I&#039;d most of the top 20% vendors can probably help you out....but be mindful of your selection of vendors, i&#039;d probably not spend all that cash in one transaction but chop it up among several for the best price and protection.

When i win big, or get a couple wins in a row, i will bet low for a few bets, like .01 btc, or .02. I purposefully try to provoke a loss from the system, as it is gauranteed to give you one with the martingale strategy. These are adaptive algorithms, so if you managed to get a series of big wins with the martingale strategy, it will know that, allow you to think you&#039;re strategy is flawless. Then you start betting larger and larger amounts trying to double over and over with a larger and larger series of losses interspersed with spare wins. The whole goal of their system is to make you bet as much as possible in anger, because your strategy appeared to be working, and now it isn&#039;t. I experienced this first hand, as i had tested this with varying bet amounts at varying intervals between X number of bets. My strategy was honed and refined on the 50% win odd, with a 1.957 modifier. <br /><br />These tests of mine were performed using a blockchain.info ewallet, and i am quite happy to share the password to the account for analysis of the results to gain furthur insight into gaming their system to trusted members of the community.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also please keep in mind, with this strategy you need to set a baseline for you&#039;re win lose percentage.<br /><br />Say i bet a set amount everytime.

This strategy has some fluctuations, as do all others, however this one is gauranteed to make you money if you play it calmly, safely, and anxiety free. If you play this game as a business you can make money. I went from 4 bitcoins, up to 11 bitcoins at one point, before i got cocky and disregarded my own strategy and played regular martingale.<br /><br />As i have stated before, i would be happy to share the empty blockchain.info ewallet login info with members i know, for transaction analysis.<br /><br />Edit:also i forgot to mention the max bet amount is 250 btc flat. Potentially using my system at that odd you could almost double your money if you max that bet and win, equaling around 189.25 net profit in bitcoins in about 10 seconds if you win<br /><br />Edit 2: This is actually just one of a few ewallets i performed these tests on over a few weeks. I tried moving around a bit testing if they burned a specific address, or if they somehow worked with blockchain.info to help recognize people gaming their system. This particular ewallet has around 125+ sample bets for you guys to analyze

Like i said there is certainly a bit of room for improvement, and i&#039;m not suggesting you go into this without taking a look at that transaction history I am willing to provide you. Just remember it will say 28 btc sent/received. That is just the total amounts for each,since the account balance is at 0 they match. I only had around 4 btc at the time, and at my highest amount i had 11, before i went full retard and went regular martingale because i wanted quick money.<br /><br />This takes a little patience in order to fully realize that the strategy is working. like i said, you EXPECT losses on this, hence why you are betting a small amount. I figured out that a bet of less than .03 bitcoins does not guarantee the particular loss chain i was talking about. It seems it is a little amount dependent(just a theory). I used the numbers listed, that was an actual sample bet chain.<br /><br />You can technically bet as high as you want on that expected win(2-3 losses after a moderate sized win means put a larger bet in, the system is going to give you the win to keep you playing, because it expects people to be using regular martingale). I won 1.5 bitcoins in one bet with this strategy, and remember my starting amount was 4 coins.<br /><br />Pm me if you want the blockchain info, I actually want people to test and refine my strategy
