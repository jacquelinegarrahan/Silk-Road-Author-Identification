				If it&#039;s in the &#039;Unshipped orders&#039; part of the Orders page, you can cancel it by selecting cancel in the with selected dropdown and clicking go. The order will be cancelled and the buyer will get their money back. No feedback can be left<br /><br />If you have confirmed the order and the buyer has not yet finalized the order, it still shows in the &#039;Orders in transit&#039; part of the Orders page. To cancel the order, select never arrived or never sent in the far left column and click the cancel button to the right. Again, the order will be cancelled and the buyer will get their money back. The buyer will be able to leave feedback.<br /><br />If the order still shows in the &#039;Orders in transit&#039; section and the auto-finalize draws near, the buyer can file for a resolution. Through the Resolution Center, the buyer can request a % refund, you can offer a different refund %. Once you come to an agreed upon % refund, you can approve the appropriate refund %. The buyer will be able to leave feedback.<br /><br />If the buyer has finalized, the order will no longer show in the &#039;Orders in transit&#039; section and you will have received your funds. To send a refund amount, you will have to go to the Account page. From there you can specify either a bitcoin address or a user name that you wish to send funds to.&nbsp; You need to specify the amount to send in BTC, so check the MtGox rate for your desired currency and figure out the proper BTC amount (divide the local currency value amount by the current BTC exchange rate of the local currency). I usually go with the weighted average. Fill in the user name and amount fields, type in your PIN and click send. The funds will be sent direct to the user.<br /><br />Note that if you are using hedged escrow, the buyer will not get the full amount back. They will get the order amount minus the hedge fee.<br /><br />MJMuse

				I understand all this but none of it explains what makes a refund show up next to the buyers completed orders after checkout. you know how next to the buyers name and listing name is says x/y x=completed orders and y= either the % or number of refunds, idk because none of my buyers have had anything but 0 there.

				OK, I got it now. When a refund is issued through the Resolution Center, it will count against the buyers refund rate. It&#039;s calculated based on the dollar amount refunded/dollar amount spent, not by the number of transactions refunded/number of transactions. Whatever that calculation comes to is the second value, y, the buyer&#039;s refund percent.<br /><br />That it&#039;s 0 for all of your buyers is because none of them have had a refund issued before. At least not through the Resolution Center.<br /><br />Also, if you click on that x/y% link, you can see the buyer&#039;s stats (Total transactions, Total spent, Refund rate, Auto-finalize rate and how long they&#039;ve been a member). If the order end&#039;s up in Resolution Center, you will be able to see these stats again.<br /><br />MJMuse
