				All the ecstasy i find locally are 100% fake piperazine shit, so i wanted to buy some on here and there are never any ecstasy sellers in the U.S, so i had to buy some internationally. Bought like 5 from one guy in Germany and bought another 5 from a guy in the Netherlands. Neither purchases ever madie it to my house, im guessing they were both taken by customs and i only got a partial refund for one of the orders.<br /><br />so whats even the point?, it takes 3x as long to deliver, shipping cost 3x as more, its about 300x more risky, and what you get the package 3/10 times. <br /><br />I really think everyone should stop ordering out of there continent.

				You have to know the risks are significantly higher when shipping internationally. You have to be willing to lose on international orders, because there is just a lot more that can go wrong. At least it wasn&#039;t a big order. I always go domestic if I can.

				Pills are one of the riskiest things to ship, as they are easily detected by customs&#039; scanners. A brief read of these forums would tell that molly was the much better option to buy internationally. Oh well.

				I used to order from the Dam off of another site a couple of years ago and received 7-8 packages over about 1 year period and never had a problem receiving them and none were ever opened. I have not ordered from there in about 2 years (site is still open and selling) so I do not know if policy has changed but I doubt they open all packages, do they look closer at them I am sure they do but with all the domestic sellers I decided it was safer to avoid crossing borders so only order local now.

				as long as you pick a trustworthy vendor with great packaging, ordering international is the only way to go. Also, almost everyone i know on here(at least in my town)&nbsp; uses this site for ecstasy since quality in the USA is horrendous. If you want domestic then get from paperchasing&#039;s listings since he resells for mitanox and ivory. They have some of the best mdma and stealthiest shipping i have experienced. I have never lost a package out of the many to them. Also the statement about how no-one orders internationally is highly mistaken, just deal with the OG&#039;S that have graced this website long enough that they sail through customs(mitanox,ivory, streetpharmacy). once again if you are still paranoid work with paperchasing. He is backed up by the best sellers on here and can be trusted<br />

				I don&#039;t think any of us can accurately state how many packages get confiscated(much less the grand statement that all do). it is nothing but conjecture and in my personal experience with NL i have gotten many packages through unopened(from mitanox and freedompeople). it all counts on who you deal with, which is why it is important to only deal with OG&#039;S that have been on here for a while

				I have ordered from both Ivory straight up and Dopeboy to US. No problems at all getting to me. Just seeing alot of the reviews of other EU vendors makes me avoid them.

				I don&#039;t know that MOST people order domestically, as I&#039;m not SR and don&#039;t know the actual numbers.<br />I DO know that I am more likely to order internationally, purely due to the fact that it&#039;s easier for cops to arrange sting ops within their country of origin.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t a huge concern, but it does lean me towards international more than national.<br />I research the folks I buy off of on the forums, and so far I have never lost a package.<br />If I do, then I&#039;ll likely revisit this strategy.<br />Good luck folks!
