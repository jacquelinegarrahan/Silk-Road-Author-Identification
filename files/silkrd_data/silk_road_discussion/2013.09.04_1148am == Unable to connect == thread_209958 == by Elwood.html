				This is the message box I&#039;ve been getting all morning while trying to get onto the main SR site. Either that or the connection will time out. Been having problems for a couple of days now, but it seems worse today. Hard to get anything done!

				<br />&nbsp;Hi<br />&nbsp;It is working intermittently here for me, I am on at the moment, but over the last few days I have uninstalled , reinstalled TOR 3 times open and closed countless times, sometimes I get in sometimes not.<br />The Forum is as bad for me, I type a reply then cannot post, or get message say last post was less than a minute ago and shuts me out again.<br />I have been using SR early in the morning UK time and for me thats when it works best.<br />C&nbsp;

				I still cant connect, I have been trying for the past hour, possibly hour and a half. This is riduclous. No update to explain why or anything. <br /><br />I really need access to my Btc at the moment so this is a real kick in the teeth. <br /><br />I just cant seem to get on , for the last few days it has been really hard to connect, Having to refresh the page 5 times etc before you get on, But now it is seriously having issues. <br />Things have changed in the last few months and I dont like it one bit.<br /><br />Can a Mod please comment if this is meant to be happening? <br />

				Not nessasarily the last few months, the road seems to of come a long way. Alot of connection problems were fixed... if you think back to how it was 12 months back its most of the time so much better.<br /><br />Yes your right today its been near impossible and the last few days difficult at times. Sucks when you need to access BTC urgent and get to orders. Iv come to accept this happens from time to time. DPR would update if it was anything of concern.

				It has been slow here as well.<br />I think it might be tor related problem.<br />They got like 500k new users after TPB released their tor based browser.

				try logging on as a relay(non-exit) when you log into tor or after doesnt matter. <br />Not that this will fix it but if huge increase in numbers it should be running great but i think more people need to relay.<br /><br /><br />B 8)

				@ALL<br /><br />don&#039;t try to connect over and over again, <br /><br />1<br />if the server is under attack, its just putting more of a load on it.<br /><br />2<br />in times like these the server is much more vunerable. so you might get you details stolen etc.

				Is all you have to do select to run as a relay in vidalia settings?&nbsp; I imagine it is only safe as a non-exit relay?

				Now I can&#039;t get back on again, the main site is practically unusable and has been for days! I suppose now everyone is going to those other sites. If this mess doesn&#039;t get resolved sometime soon, I may have to as well. Did I miss some announcement somewhere where they told us what was happening and how long the downtime would be?
