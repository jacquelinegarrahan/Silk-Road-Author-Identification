				I recently ordered 50 5mg Diazepam from SavOnDrugs. Only received 30 pills, so I sent them a message, and they responded saying something like, &quot;the listing was for 25 DHC, I threw in 5 extra because you&#039;re a new customer.&quot; I looked at their other listings, and they did have one for 25 DHC pills, but that&#039;s not what I ordered. I don&#039;t even know what that is. Not sure how they got that mixed up, but what I received, I believe to be 5mg Diazepam. I did not finalize when I received the 30 pills, because I wanted to see if they would realize their mistake and send me the rest. Anyway, I wrote back and told them that it was the 50 5mg Diazepam that I ordered, not the other thing. Haven&#039;t heard back, and the vendor hasn&#039;t been seen for 5 days. I&#039;m not sure what I should do now. I don&#039;t want it to auto-finalize, and I&#039;m kind of confused by the resolution options. I have 5 more days left. What should I do now?

				Hit resolve button and elect to either give them more time or ask for a refund. <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry so much about your refund rate. You can always explain to the next vendor what happened and be sure to mention whom it happened with. Some vendors like the idea that business was diverted their way by their competition&#039;s bad business and they&#039;ll treat you well. <br /><br />Besides, everyone knows SR rating system is flawed in the way things are weighted. So a refund rate can always be explained away.
