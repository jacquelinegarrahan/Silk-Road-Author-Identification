				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;people act like it is their right to be here and that they deserve to be mad and throw a bitch fit. They dont understand the gravity of the service that is offered here and act like little girls when there is a small problem... it really makes me sick. Before SR i would rarely ever have access to wonderful drugs like mdma and when i did have access to them it was terrible quality. i am eternally grateful to SR. even if the site was to go down and the money in my account dissapeared i would still be grateful! i have made 33,000$ because of this website in the year that i have been here and at the same time have spread the love of high quality mdma to thousands of people.

The accusations of stealing and hacking people made were dumb and uncalled for, but vendors who paid for their account and have their livelihood tied in this system had a right to complain.

				I wouldn&#039;t say I complained about all this. I don&#039;t think any of the vendors (well apart from maybe that prick MtlWanker) had any thought that DPR had done a bunk or anything as silly as the other shit floating around. Personally I would have liked a bit more coms in the vendor forum but that&#039;s it because it takes the stress down for a vendor when your cash is on lock.

It&#039;s not just $150, are you that stupid? You know the commission SR takes on every sale? Do you understand how much that adds up for sellers? Vendors give way more to SR than $150.<br /><br />Of course vendors will be fine. That&#039;s not the point. Complaining is not the same as crying and being hurt about something. It&#039;s recognizing shit was done wrong and speaking up about it. There should have been a lot more communication, the way it was handled was unprofessional. It&#039;s worrying because it&#039;s indicative of the way the admin team will handle future issues. I&#039;m not asking for reparations of any sort, but I&#039;m not going to let the people that run this place think that it&#039;s fine to handle a situation like this, in this way.<br /><br />It&#039;s not being a crybaby, it&#039;s refusing to be a grateful peon ready to eat DPR&#039;s asshole when his team fucked up.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: lol this came off angrier than I meant it. I&#039;m not upset with DPR. I&#039;m upset with the dumb fuckwits telling me I have no right to complain. DPR actually handled this situation perfectly in his position.<br /><br />His admin team on the other hand.. if you&#039;re saying they didn&#039;t fuck up in how this was handled, you&#039;re either a raging fanboy or dumb as shit.<br /><br />So yeah, guess I came off like a cunt on wheels cause hardhustle is such a disrespectful piece of shit. No idea why people are so concerned with others complaining.
