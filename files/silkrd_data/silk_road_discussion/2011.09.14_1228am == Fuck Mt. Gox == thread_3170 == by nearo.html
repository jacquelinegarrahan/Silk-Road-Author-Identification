			<dd class="postbody">
				Went to move some money into Bitcoins today, and Mt. Gox let me deposit USD and then use those USD to buy BTC. Then, when I tried to send those bitcoins to an address outside of Mt. Gox, I get a message saying my account is under review. WTF?!? I&#039;ve never done anything out of the ordinary and all of a sudden I try to withdraw bitcoins which I just bought today, and it&#039;s under review.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />I hope we get an established system on here with Moneypak to BTC. Fuck all those other services, let&#039;s keep the fees that we get on SR. The moneypak exchange services that are cropping up here sound like a great alternative. Next time, I&#039;m definitely gonna try that route.<br /><br /><br />SR FTW!!!<br /><br />Mt. Gox, Go to Hell!!<br /><br /><br />Usually, I&#039;m not so vulgar, but this really pissed me off today. Done venting.

				Im not tech savy at all.

Gox or any other exchanger..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Technically its possible to discover the main SR wallet (or wallets) if there are any. Since I don&#039;t want to do their thinking for them I wont spell out the steps right now, but as proof of concept I tried it for my self. *SO* assuming they can find the main wallet/s (if any exist), I still think we give Mt.Gox a chance. Think about it this way -- Mt.Gox had the open opportunity to say whatever they want to publicly about SR, and they simply said they they were neither for or against. That&#039;s pretty cool and neutral stance to be taking I think, and not totally un-noble.<br /><br />They are openly giving us a hint, that they will comply with LE when requested. You can imagine so, because they will be under pressure to close their doors if they don&#039;t co-operate. So with this clue we must equip ourselves with a new strategy. Here&#039;s thought: Mt.Gox has a limit to their duty of care for BTC originating from their institution. Once a BTC changes addresses and wallets &#039;X&#039; number of times, it can no longer be considered as belonging to a Mt.Gox customer, and therefore, no investigation of account will be initiated. We simply need to experiment and find this magic number of &#039;X&#039;. I&#039;d initially place a guess at &#039;3&#039;, with a 50% confidence, and a guess of&#039;5&#039; at 85% confidence.<br /><br />Also, the future mechanism to avoid this will be a free laundry service. I suggest someone get to work immediately in creating one. It should be on the clearnet, or onoin, not really a concern there, but it should be not associated with SR, and should have a lot of clean BTC coming in too. There is already one available by the name of &#039;InstaWallet&#039;, however, InstaWallet most likely maintains thorough logs and therefore not entirely great as a long term plan for now.<br /><br />So, in short, lets give Mt.Gox a chance. They maintained a neutral public opinion with SR, and in a way, have given us a friendly heads up to be more careful and more creative with our strategies.<br /><br />ps. Some more info from the OP would be great. Do we know for sure that your investigation is linked to the article? Exactly how did you use your account before it was put on hold. Was it suspended upon your first withdrawal? Did you withdraw to how many wallets before transferring to SR? How long did you leave funds in SR kitty before spending? These questions will answer if yes or no did yoru account get closed due to an SR related investigation. Lets not all assume to quickly before we get the entire facts.

				Mt Gox said the right thing in the interview.&nbsp; Think about it from a legal standpoint.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even though they are not an American company and fall under a couple of different jurisdictions, they want AND NEED to present as a clean, law abiding global citizen.&nbsp; They cant answer with &quot;no, we do NOT cooperate with LE because we don&#039;t want everybody to get busted....&quot;&nbsp; See what I mean?&nbsp; It would be like a night shift cab driver telling a local news reporter that he does not answer to the cops.&nbsp; If he chooses to drive drug dealers around at night its his business and he ain&#039;t gonna cooperate.&nbsp; See what I mean? It just doesn&#039;t work that way.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />They said what they had to say. Good stock answer.<br /><br />I personally find Gox&#039;s customer service really really poor so I dont use them anymore.&nbsp; I won&#039;t bore you with my story but basically they made a mistake and it took well over a week to get them to acknowledge and correct it.<br /><br />

				One other thing...... <br /><br />Here is a direct quote from mtgox &quot;However, if we are required to track payments coming in or out of Silk Road, we will comply.&quot;<br /><br />Ya, sure you will comply.&nbsp; I am not a super tech savvy guy like I know some of you are.&nbsp; However, without giving up too much about myself, I happen to know a bit about law. ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me tell you something.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care how much manpower, time, and money LE (regardless of the agency) put into this they would never, ever get a conviction unless someone was really stupid and totally buckled up a confession and produced hard evidence i.e. personal computer.......&nbsp; &nbsp; Even with that it would still be a tough gig to prosecute.&nbsp; I can hear a judge now... &quot;So where are these alleged drugs?&nbsp; Where is the currency?&nbsp; Where is this BTC you are claiming the buyer paid with?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; See where I am going?<br /><br />Ive gotta go to bed but I like pondering this.&nbsp; I will be back tomorrow.<br />

				Doesn&#039;t mt gox realize that 90 plus percent of all bitcoin users are using them illicitly? Why are they cutting of their noses to spite their face?<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t make any sense to me.. all they will do is put themselves out of business. Maybe they will help in token busts, just to give the appearance that they will cooperate.. But if Mt Gox think that main streem businesses will use bitcoin only for legit puproses, they have another thing coming..

				Same thing happened here... deposited from Dwolla, converted to BTC, tried to withdraw... got the message &quot;Account is pending review, please contact aml@mtgox.com&quot;<br /><br />Never sent BTC from the MtGox account to/from SR previously, so I have no idea why the account would be under review.&nbsp; Pretty pissed right now as they will accept your money, but not let you withdraw it in either BTC or dollars, or codes of any kind!<br /><br />They do not warn you when depositing either... you only get the message once you try to withdraw.&nbsp; The message appears nowhere else on your account until you attempt to withdraw.<br /><br />Moral:<br />**DO NOT USE MTGOX**

				yes definitely. however, laundering does not only include using several hops until you transfer your money to SR but also to &quot;wash&quot; it. For example, you could send it to someone who then sends you completely different coins instead of your old ones to the adress you want. They are then unlinked, provided the launder service is trustable.<br />Much love<br />M
