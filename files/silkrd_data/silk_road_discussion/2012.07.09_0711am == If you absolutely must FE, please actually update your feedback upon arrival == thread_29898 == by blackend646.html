				Has anyone else ever been in this situation? <br /><br />You see a listing for a product you&#039;ve been dying to try, at a price you can afford and being sold by a vendor with 100% feedback. You start to get excited, check out the vendors page and see they have a sizeable amount of transactions. Finally! The product you&#039;ve been dying to try (Ketamine &amp; LSD in my case) is within your grasp. <br /><br />You scroll down, and see the vendors feedback is a wall of &quot;FE - will update when received&quot;. Nearly every single piece of feedback, days, weeks, or months old is exactly that. <br /><br /><br />If you really feel the need to bypass your only means of protection on here, that&#039;s your right. But if you don&#039;t update your feedback when you receive the product, or when the vendor screws you over, it messes things up for everyone. How is anybody supposed to know if a vendor is actually trustworthy if all of the feedback on his page is &quot;FE WILL UPDATE LATER&quot;?<br /><br />&nbsp;How is a legitimate vendor that you so generously decided to float your money to, and actually didn&#039;t decide to fuck you over supposed to expand his/her customer base if everyone who finalized early for them doesn&#039;t mention that they actually received their order?<br /><br /><br />tl;dr <br /><br />If you are going to finalize early, which you shouldn&#039;t, please actually update your feedback when you do or don&#039;t receive your package.

				Exactly in the same boat, the noriega boat (the actual http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Noriega did have plenty of boats btw).<br />Thats why as a vendor and buyer here, i&#039;m not going to stress the FE thing. If they want FE from me, they can suck it, it just dosn&#039;t work that way.<br />As a vendor, i dont mind either way, i&#039;m telling my customers who insist on FE i say, dont do it, relax, wait till you get your stuff. Then give me a fair appraisal on my product. Hells know, i stuffed up a couple of times, and i&#039;ve fixed that, most recenetly was sending out pills were whole on my side, went through the mail sorting machine crushed up. <br />Thats why you dont FE at all, no need, vendors make mistakes and make sure they know the mistakes they are making. Constructive criticism.

				Agreed 100%. <br /><br />Another thing that gets me is when people write &quot;FE for trusted vendor&quot; when the vendor has been around for 10 days and all of their &quot;sales&quot; are other people who finalized early. How the hell does that make them &quot;trusted&quot;? <br /><br />But that is another thread entirely

				Sorry if I&#039;m lame, but I&#039;m new here, please excuse the lameness...<br /><br />I haven&#039;t FE&#039;d , but I had two fast successful deliveries. Gave 5 stars to both and finalized on delivery. One I said I would report back after sampling the product ( which was good, btw ).<br /><br />Sooo, how do you make another report on the same delivery, after you finalized and it disappears from your order directory?<br /><br />Thanks, for any pointers, and I think the answer would be good further the OP&#039;s goal to edumacate the masses that say they&#039;ll come back to report. I&#039;m sure it must be something easy I missed...<br /><br />

				I only have a couple of purchases so some vendors still ask me to fe. Would it be too hard to have a leave feedback later option? I always go back and update my feedback, but having &quot;FE&quot; as feedback for a week is pretty useless.

As a vendor what you see from a client is number of purchases and then a % (at a glance), the % is auto-finalise and/or refunds. We can click on this link to further investigate the person i.e. how much money has been spent on SR number of transactions auto finalise rate.<br /><br />So bascially what i&#039;m saying to you is get your number of parcels through. Get some small stuff sent to you. $30 for some valiums from a local dude, sweet that sounds great even if i FE i&#039;ve only lost $30.<br />Then when you got some small orders done, you can work in escrow. cause your numbers will have changed, it will be 10/0% (meaning ten orders done perfectly). So when you want to buy something off of someone who wants FE you can tell em escrow exists for a reason, and i&#039;m using it.
