				Wrong site: we don&#039;t give away btc.&nbsp; And we don&#039;t encourage people to ask for stuff here, tho periodically people try.&nbsp; We buy and sell.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t understand bitcoins, you need to read up more on what they are, and how to purchase them.&nbsp; Elsewhere.

				If anyone is giving away anything of value for free it would be best to give it to me. Dont worry I will redistribute the wealth properly and you can rest easy knowing anything given to me will be put to good use!

				Rolling Stone influx, you hit the nail on the head.&nbsp; That just brings in a whole new generation of people that need things handed to them (both &quot;stuff&quot; and info) without working to get it.&nbsp; I can totally say i spent damn near 2-4 weeks researching before i even had my first purchase.

				I&#039;ve also spent a few weeks doing research when I first stumbled on to this site, before I&nbsp; even considered buying I had to figure out PGP, tor, and arrange a drop house. This is not something to be taken lightly.

				Since I am a genius it only took me 5 seconds do develop foolproof methods for purchasing and selling on Silk Road. The methods I developed are far superior to everyone else despite the fact that it only took me 5 seconds compared to several weeks. But soon my children I will offer to re-sell my wisdom on a limited basis. I suggest each of you put some money aside for this day as you will be making the most sensible purchase you have ever made! Since demand for my time and wisdom is so great those seeking my guidance will be entered in a lottery. The winners of the lottery will be awarded the privilege of purchasing some of my wisdom and infinite knowledge on a limited basis at exceptionally high prices!

				Brockeh,<br /><br />I know how important it is to have the chance to purchase a small piece of my infinite wisdom but it wouldnt be fair to all the other people. But if luck is on your side you will be one of the 2% who is given access to my wisdom at an unbelievably high price!
