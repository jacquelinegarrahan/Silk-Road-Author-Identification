				The wallet address was not a SR address? Seems strange, never heard of such a thing. But this seems to be the root of the issue...<br /><br />Are you absolutely positive the address was not accidentally messed up, does the block explorer list the destination address so you can double check where they were sent and if this matches the address listed under your acct?<br />&nbsp;<br />Possibly you mixed up two addresses and sent it to the wrong one and the coins are in another wallet?<br />Maybe theyre floating around in cyberspace still and you just got unlucky with the longest btc transfer ever, hopefully they show up! <br /><br />I hope you are able to get everything straightened out. Good luck<br />- miR

				Fuck man.&nbsp; I feel for you.&nbsp; I made mistakes in the beginning and lost some serious money before I got my shit together with all the wallets and everything.&nbsp; Sorry, I know that doesn&#039;t take away the sting but I&#039;ve been there and feel your pain.&nbsp; It&#039;s a growing/learning experience.

				Hopefully you havent requested a new btc address yet. take a screen shot of the address listed in your acct, then SR cant say its not theirs...<br /><br />I know SR would help you out if they recognized the address, so them not recognizing it is the part I dont understand. Something was messed up along the transaction somewhere obviously.<br /><br />Instawallet timing out wont necessarily screw the transfer up, I actually had a timeout occur on my last transfer (yesterday) and my coins arrived <br /><br />The whole process is definitely a learning experience but unfortunately it does not seem clear you were even the one at fault. <br /><br />I certainly am sorry if you have lost the coins! As TA said, many of us have been in similar boats involving the loss of btc and we empathize with you. <br /><br />Hope you didnt lose too much, I guess the only thing I can recommend is triple check all your btc addresses and make multiple smaller transfers than one large transfer to avoid the loss of all your coins. <br />- miR
