				Just wanted to remind everyone that our resident scammer and troll Peopleb4profits, aka King Joey, aka dont FE early (i assume) is now spamming the forum as Capital Gains<br /><br />*potentially also using the name doublemint on SR, use caution when dealing with this member <br /><br />good job, if you hadnt been spamming i probably wouldnt have been reading your posts and wouldnt have even noticed. thats what you get for posting 50 times in less than 5 hours <br /><br />This member should not be trusted! He has ripped of countless members and is continuously spamming the forum under multiple user names and i will not tolerate this behavior. <br /><br />all of these threads are about him scamming: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4421<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4499<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13088<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11425<br /><br />do a search on his username peopleb4profits or on &#039;king joey&#039; for further info<br /><br />Here is a quote from a year ago even admitting he is:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3520.msg37228#msg37228">Quote from: Capital Gains on October 24, 2011, 04:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am PeopleB4Profits.<br /><br />I am now asking customers to start reviewing me on the forum.<br /><br />But as fantastic said most of my feedbacks are from BitCoins but 1 person did finalize early for 1 gel tab of LSD, 1 person finalized early for an orrder of adderall, 1 person ordered a copy of roller coster tycon that i provide instantly<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				youre welcome, hopefully this will help prevent someone from being scammed. he has already been making offers to sell on the forum without a vendor account, in addition to inquiring about a vendors policy for large shipments that dont arrive...<br /><br />&nbsp;vendors as well as buyers need to keep their guard up<br /><br />he probably has at least a few other high post accounts already though because immediately after posting i received multiple neg karma points and havent posted anywhere else recently that would likely upset anyone except here. unless others dont approve of me calling him out? hes also pissed at me because he was spamming to get this account up to 100 posts as well but i removed the clear spam threads <br /><br />and then i receive this message from him, as if i am making it up when i quoted his own post from a year ago i bet he forgot about lol:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=4129">Quote from: Capital Gains on October 18, 2012, 09:06 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thanks for taking time out to write some stories. I hope you accomplish what you set out to do. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />if i prevent one person from being scammed or having their time wasted by this troll then i certainly did accomplish what i intended

				I must say the name Capital Gains set some warning bells off for me as well. The name was everywhere on the forum in a matter of minutes, literally flooding the forum over numerous threads. Nice work microRNA.&nbsp; :)
