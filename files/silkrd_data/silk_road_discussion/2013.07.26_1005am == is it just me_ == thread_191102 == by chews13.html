				It is JUST YOU.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />There has been NO BUST because of SR...NONE.<br /><br />In fact, the last one reported in here yesterday is great advertisement for Silk Road. And if that pot dealer would have used Silk Road they would still be in business. There was actually two Tv stations from Sacramento(could be more, I only saw two) that did an online report. The reporter for one of them does a really shitty job of reporting about the case from the unsealed court order. The other stations reporter does a better job of telling the story but still does a shitty job of reporting the facts.<br /><br />Here is a Clear-net link to a news story and video about it--http://www.kcra.com/news/mailorder-marijuana-postal-inspectors-link-operation-to-sac-region/-/11797728/21156348/-/nv5v6u/-/index.html<br /><br />The truth, as it is written in the court document that was unsealed yesterday, is that they caught the pot dealers because they were receiving large amounts of cash to a post office in Rocklin Ca and fictitious businesses in two other small towns within Sacramento California. That is how and why they got caught. <br /><br />Over 400 packages of money being sent to them in this small post office and to the phoney businesses. <br /><br />They did not get busted from sending the drugs, or dogs smelling the money or from them using btc or from them not using pgp or from the dogs smelling the weed or from them going into the post office or from them using anything that has to do with Silk Road. In fact all the things that the crazies in here love to talk about as high risk and very dangerous had nothing to do with why these people got busted.<br /><br />THEY GOT BUSTED BECAUSE THEY DID NOT USE SILK ROAD. PERIOD!! Even Astor would have to agree that this bust had NOTHING to do with a vendor on Silk road not using pgp or with Silk Road at all.<br /><br />The real problem is that people like you report in these forums about a bust and they put a title on their thread that makes it look like a SR vendor got busted yet again. When in fact it is simply not true. And NO vendor got busted. But a lot of forum members will not read the article or try and read the whole document. They will instantly just start typing a post about security on Silk Road and they will start speculating on the what if&#039;s and they will all talk as if it was a vendor that got busted. This used to happen all the time in the forums. So in fact OP there is a lot less of these reports then before ...so it is just you! I really believe that there are some members that want a vendor to get busted so they can say &quot; See we told you&quot;. <br /><br />One day it could happen. But it will not be because of silk road. It will be because someone will be lazy or plain stupid and get caught. Or some girlfriend or wife will RAT them out. In fact this bust had a lot to do with a RAT. There is actually a lot of good info in the court document that was unsealed and would be a great read for any vendor or anyone that wants to know the truth about things and way&#039;s that LE catch drug dealers. This totally sucks as no matter what, I hate when someone gets busted for selling drugs. But the good news, if you want to call it that, is that when s document like this get&#039;s unsealed it is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY to learn more about LE and their practices. It is really priceless information and it is a lot better then the info some of the computer nerds talk about as facts when in fact the truth is they know nothing and are just speculating and hiding behind the ole &quot; better safe then sorry&quot; theory.<br /><br />The great news is the more times the media reports about Silk Road the more members we get! More people come here that want and need drugs that would have never found this place unless there was a news story. I know there will be some people that say &quot;that is bad&quot; it brings more attention from LE. That is simply not true. They already know about us and have for 2 years. So who cares about them. Getting new buyers and more GOOD vendors is a great thing for everyone. It brings in more options and that lowers prices and that makes it more competitive that in turns makes vendors work harder at being great! it is a win win.<br /><br />No press is bad press&nbsp; ;D... of course the crazies will disagree. But they also have 20 gallons of water and five 10oz bars of silver so that when a solar flair comes they can survive. We need more great vendors and buyers. And for stupid people, hopefully that article will scare them away. As they will misread it like most people and think that the pot dealers got busted&nbsp; because of Silk Road and they will believe this is a bad place to sell drugs. The one thing we do not need is bad vendors.<br /><br />Everyone here should read the unsealed document.

Getting payments not using SR, shipping large sums of cash via mail constantly and dealing IRL. The busts have happened because of those things, and LE has been able to link them to SR due to sub par computer security. I think the methylone was intercepted, after that all the people (The Springer Cartel :)) involved were happy ratting each other out.<br /><br />Is there any busts that have happened to people only selling through SR and only using the SR payment system?

EVER. IN OVER 2 YEARS. NONE.<br /><br /><br />But there have been a lot of false reports posted in here. And EVERY TIME ... a certain few guys ... actually quite a few guys, make post after the OP and they talk about the bust as if it really happened and the security measures that could have been taken to avoid it. It is brutal. They end up scaring people that do not read the OP or just glance over it and the threads by page 2 turns into that it was just a matter of time, other vendors will go down soon, it is a honey hole ect.<br /><br />In fact there was a reported LE honey hole about 6-12 months ago..the OP was just saying &quot;what if&quot; and all the crazy HERO members jumped on the thread and were commenting on it like there really was a honey hole!! It was a total joke...they did not even realize the OP said what if! They went on and on like it was real. I wish old post like that were able to be found...it would show you how all the paranoia was for nothing and just how crazy they are. <br /><br />There used to be post like that every week.<br /><br />YOUR post was great....you called out all the alleged ones and clearly state that NONE OF THEM were because of Silk Road.<br /><br />But the answer to your question is once again a BIG FAT NO!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D&nbsp; and lets hope it always stays that way!!

				I&#039;ve noticed in at least one article there was actually no connection to SR at all, but for some reason they mentioned SR. See for busts it doesn&#039;t always matter what the truth is, if the gov&#039;t wants to show they&#039;re making progress on taking down SR, they can just simply put a PR spin on it and say that.

Can&#039;t tell you how many times we&#039;d get a call from a department, usually their SWAT team purchasing officer, usually late May or early June, that they had &quot;budget&quot; left over that they had to spend or they&#039;d lose it. The game they play with their city manager is &quot;gee, we ran out last year for the umpteenth year in a row, you can&#039;t cut our budget, you need to expand it&quot;. The more surplus they have left over from their previous year&#039;s budget, the lower the chances their boss will get the budget expansion he&#039;s put in for. <br /><br />and the reason for the May or June calls, their fiscal year usually runs July 1 to June 30<br /><br />The only concern i&#039;ve got from these busts, whether or not the busts were the result of doing business here on SR, is the fact that if those clowns were that stupid, how much of their records did they still have on hand when they got busted - if they&#039;ve sold here on SR, that is a concern for the SR community. Busts of dealers make the nat&#039;l media - busts of individuals don&#039;t. So we don&#039;t have anywhere near an accurate handle on how many SR customers are &quot;out of action&quot; so to speak. Unfortunately, we don&#039;t have a SR version of an ISO 9000/9001 Standards of Management Practices certification, where vendors have been certified to be maintaining a certain level of security.

				I never said the bust started from the road but pointed towards the road just seems there have been more mention of dumb vendors/buyers getting busted for one reason or another then either they are linked or the media points it towards the road .... another goodthing to mention/repeat until everyone gets it STOP POSTING ON FACEBOOK AND REDDIT about what you do on silkroad.... also be smart enough to have a user name for road that has nothing to do with your normal user names you use on the clearnet ....

What SR needs is people who find it through connections, and through word-of-mouth, so that by the time they end up on SR they already know a good deal about drug-dealing etiquette, paranoia, drug use and concealment et cetera - don&#039;t mention drugs in text messages, don&#039;t order to your house, don&#039;t let the money go until you have the drugs in your hand, never talk to police, put a towel under your door when you&#039;re smoking weed...<br /><br />The people who hear about SR from the news, and only from the news, are not going to know any of that shit. They might not even do drugs at all, they might decide to use SR as their first foray into the culture, which is dangerous as hell not only for them, but for anyone else involved in the transaction when they do some dumb shit like get caught and turned in by their parents, or sign for a controlled delivery...
