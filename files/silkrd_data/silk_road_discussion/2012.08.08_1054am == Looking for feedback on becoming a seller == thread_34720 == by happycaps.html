				Hey all after hearing so much about this place I am thinking of jumping in.<br /><br />I guess my first question would be is it worth it?&nbsp; I have been growing fungus for over a year and a half and finally got the hang of it.&nbsp; Mostly grew some for friends but in theory at least I could grow enough for lots and lots of people.<br /><br />If I go forward with this it will be a long term plan including buying a new laptop only used at coffee shops, buying encryption soft ware and fake ID to receive the fruits of bitcoins.<br /><br />What would be the first step to become a seller?&nbsp; Any links would be greatly appreciated as so much Tor and onion related stuff seems to move the link around a lot.&nbsp; I tried to register at what I thought was a Silk Road link and just got bumped around.<br /><br />Probably more questions to follow.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Well Happycaps, welcome to SR!<br /><br />There are a lot of differences between growing some mushrooms for you and your friends and growing bulk. I wont go into it here, just a quick warning.<br /><br />You will have to set up an SR account and convert it to a seller account, that will cost $150 US (In bitcoin) You can find the link on the main SR site once you log in, at the bottom of the page.<br /><br />Beyond that, keep reading and researching there is a lot to learn and no need to be in a hurry. Be safe and learn what it takes to remain safe first. It will be more than your security you have to worry about, you will also have to worry about your buyers security and that should not be taken lightly.<br />

				Thanks for the response. <br /><br />I guess my initial apprehension was that I signed up or tried to sign up at the same time they were doing a site upgrade.&nbsp; I am new to TOR and Onion and just didn&#039;t really know what to expect.<br /><br />I guess the solution as always like they say is just to ....lurk more.<br /><br />Hope to be up and running and putting some magic in people&#039;s lives very soon.
