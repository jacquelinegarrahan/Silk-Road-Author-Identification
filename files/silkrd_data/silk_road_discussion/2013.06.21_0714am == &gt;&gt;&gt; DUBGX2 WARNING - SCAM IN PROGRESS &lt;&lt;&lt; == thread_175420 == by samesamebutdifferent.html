				Had FE scam written all over it from the moment their listings went back up, no PGP, really? use privnote because they were too lazy to decrypt addresses they had no intention of shipping anything too, cheap listing prices on 14g and 28g, oh really why is that? <br /><br />I just hope that not too many people fell for this scam, spread the word and tell people to use the forums before ordering ALWAYS, many do not and that is the main reason these scams keep on happening.<br /><br />And do not FE!

				^ I agree 100% about the admins caring the way samesame says, I&#039;ve never been seen them fail to provide speedy help when I needed it and never have I been less than satisfied with their decisions. They do pretty damn good in making just calls from what I&#039;ve seen.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious if there&#039;s any clear link between this guy (dubGx2 with the wacky green coke) and the original DubG.<br />I wonder if DubG had eversubmitted a complaint about this guy riding on his nuts to the bwnk (and if not, why?).<br />Was there a similar shipping origin between them? If I were a vendor, I&#039;d be up in arms if some new guy named himself to mimic me. Then again, I&#039;ve long had the sense that the original DubG simply goes about his business and little phases him , if noticed at all.

				Yes DubGx2 was a separate vendor account DubG setup to just sell coke and something else.<br /><br />I received the best coke I have ever seen in my life from him maybe 6 weeks or so ago.<br /><br />Don&#039;t need anymore but that is a bummer he has turned rogue.&nbsp; When he was legit was an asset to SR.<br />

				DubGX2 was recently scammed for $2,000 by the more expieranced sieral scammer good drugs. Good drugs also stole from many other people. After good drugs stole $2000 from dubgx he went on to steal from dozens others and operated several accounts since. DubGx2 was mad because he was scammed by a scammer himself.

				I always wondered if this was a scam from the start, why would someone create another account to sell from, unless they wanted the reputation of their name to pull in buyers and then not to tarnish their hard earned stats when they pulled the scam<br />I was a DubG customer and on his vendor page he advertised DubGx2 I ordered 3.5 in the very first days it got sent express with tracking, never arrived, he kept saying he was talking to FEDEX and was gettin it re-delivered it eventually got sent back/returned. Because DubGx2 offered 0% refund I started investigating so I could get my coins back so I rang FEDEX they said no-one had contacted them and it turned out the address was wrong. I was in resolution for nearly 3 months I only got a refund the other week. <br />Resolution should not keep getting extended like that, it seemed like once the BC price dropped I got my refund as it was un-hedged, so I lost out<br />I just wished i had gotten that coke thats what really sucks

				When Dubgx2 first came on the scene I along with many others ordered and FE&#039;d, all 3 of my orders arrived and it was some of the nicest coke I&#039;ve had off SR. <br /><br />Then the prices went through the roof, then I started to hear of no shows, then when they re-listed and the price had dropped big time alarm bells rang. <br /><br />This vendor could have been here for the long haul and done great trade and made a lot of money but&nbsp; instead they chose to be short sighted and went for the fast buck which will pale into insignificance compared to what they could have made as a vendor if they had continued to offer the same level of service and quality as they did when they first started to vend.<br /><br />
