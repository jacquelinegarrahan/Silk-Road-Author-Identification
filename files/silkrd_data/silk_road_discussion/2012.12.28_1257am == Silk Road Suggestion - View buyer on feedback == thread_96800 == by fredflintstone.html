				Having seen alot of scams here over the last few months it seems a common thread is people FE&#039;ing but also alot of shill/fake feedbacks on the vendors account before the shit hits the fan.<br /><br />Perhaps being able to see who left the feedback could help buyer&#039;s identify who is leaving the feedback for some of these new vendors. <br /><br />I mean its easy for vendors to setup dozens of gram or point listings and make themselves out to be something they arent. <br /><br />Just a thought ... site is great for those that use it properly and I love it.

				It is a problem but this isn&#039;t the way to go about fixing it.&nbsp; Buyers need the utmost anon and this would somewhat ruin that.&nbsp;

				Vendors are the target of LEO, not people buying here, dont you think ? Is that what your referring to ? LEO collecting who is buying what ?<br /><br />Just simply something showing who the feedback was left from .. or even a symbol somehow. Accounts registered within the last 30 days get an asterisk beside their feedback.<br /><br />Just spitballin here ....

				nyms wouldn&#039;t really help people when reading feedback, but just stats might. 1yr/50tsx alongside the review would mean more to me than MrSnuffles said:<br /><br />Or your asterisks idea beside young account feedback, but then who is to decide what age is young? I personally don&#039;t think 6 month old accounts are aged enough to trust based on that info alone. And since people can just open another account (and I don&#039;t think that should ever be hindered) age matters less than frequency with which they purchase. Then you run the risk of flooding vendors with legitimate feedback that is * * * because many people here change accounts often anyway (myself included) but my buyer stats climb quickly with each new account, so set it @ 5 or 10 purchases. Now the issue will be that vendors can make a stealth listing that is free or very low $ and buy it 5 or 10 times from their shill buyer account to remove the asterisks (I am not sure how stealth feedback shows on the vendor page, but just not leaving feedback will still boost the transaction history on the buyer account without showing the asterisks from the padding transactions) so now the only way is to use the complete stats for the buyer including $ amount spent. This is still a problem though because they could just not make new shills and use a single shill with good stats (or a couple made just for this) to fake their feedback. Now to combat this, we need to have the nym included also so you will see if the feedback is being manufactured in this way. While we are at it, maybe we should make people leave their real name and drivers license number with their feedback so we can be sure it isn&#039;t being faked.<br /><br /><br />Better idea. Don&#039;t base your decision to buy on the word of the anonymous crowd leaving anonymous feedback. Ditch the feedback system altogether, and replace the (100) with (1yr) and list the # of resolutions on their vendor page along with successful tsx. Now the buyer can guage how likely they are to go to resolution, and you don&#039;t have to worry about vendors faking feedback on hidden free or cheap listings to net more customers, and vendors don&#039;t have to worry about other vendors dinging their score with fake orders to leave 1/5 (you know this happens) without having to go through the process of resolution with the vendor, which is more time consuming, and gives the vendor the opportunity to prove his case or make the situation right without all the drama that cones from the feedback system.<br /><br />Couple this with both the delayed ability to finalize and the reduction in time for autofinalize, and you now don&#039;t have the tons of FE feedback, and you don&#039;t have vendors requesting FE due to the occurrence of autofinalizing buyers. No FE = No scam. This will also mean to get rid of the user transfer functionality to keep OOE tsx from happening and keep SR raking in the fees. When you get rid of the user transfer function, then you damage the BTC exchangers (which IMO shouldn&#039;t be doing their business the way they are anyhow, but that is another matter) So now you need three classes of user; buyer, vendor, and exchanger. The buyer cannot transfer BTC directly to another member, but the vendor and exchanger can because they both need that ability to conduct their business, whereas the only real reason for the buyer to have that functionality is to participate in OOE transactions. I guess the beggars also want regular joe to xfer them coins to their account, but that can be done using the BTC addresses and making them wait for the confirmations (they are begging after all, so they can wait an hour for their handouts)<br /><br />This got away from me quick...must be the afterglow making my mind race today, but anyway the point is that the feedback system on the market should not be anyones sole point of info on their vendors.

				@wretched - your right about the time it takes to finalize, didnt think of that. Its not a foolproof idea .. but it could be tailored to show a vendors true dealings a little better. <br /><br />the system will never be perfect, but it could be tweaked a tad. i just feel for some of these dudes who get absolutely hosed on their buys and it maybe could have been prevented. guys make dumb choices and FE or they risk too much, but its still shitty to see.

				I hate seeing people get ripped off as well, and I have seen a lot of them get fucked by many different &quot;vendors&quot; during my time here. I have been an advocate for delay in finalization and reduction in time for autofinalize since the early days, and I still think it is the best way to go for as public as this place is. Of course it is a different story behind (even slightly) screened membership sources, but this is not(and should not ever be) that. The problem is that people rely on an easily manipulated feedback system to choose their vendors. I bet only a fraction of the buyers here use SoS to help decide, and not very many vendors have SoS page links in their profile. I research every vendor I use on SoS, but I don&#039;t feel inclined to add SR vendors to it if they don&#039;t already have a page. SoS seems to be a lot more reliable of a source for info than the 1 to 5 feedback system here. And for you fred, I don&#039;t care what the feedback rating on SR is for you, I would have zero trouble using you if I were in the molly market, but that is because I know you from around the block a bit even if we don&#039;t chat much :) But I find it hard to feel too sorry for anyone who logs on to SR, and picks a vendor because he has a page of 25 &quot;5/5 FE for trusted seller&quot; feedbacks and gets burned. everyone needs to build their own trust with their vendors, or only spend money they are fully prepared to loose.<br /><br />enough wretched rambling for tonight fred. The system could use some fixing, but it&#039;s been broken from the beginning, so I doubt there will be any significant change soon.<br /><br />goodnight y&#039;all
