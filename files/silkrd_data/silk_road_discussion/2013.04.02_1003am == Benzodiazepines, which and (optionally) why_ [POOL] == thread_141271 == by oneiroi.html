				I always wondering why Valium (diazepam) and Xanax (Alprazolam) are so popular, seppecially in the UK. The first one it&#039;s just not very recreational drug, the&nbsp; second one opposite, but&nbsp; very short therm acting around 2-3 h&nbsp; and withdrawal syndromes are just amazingly bad.<br /><br />So why not lorazepam for instead or Clonazepam (Klonopin) - yes I know the advertisement (a tiny tiny sample http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e8bafab8c7), sorry, couldn&#039;t resist ;)<br /><br />Something in-between, something to mix gently with a pint of lager.<br /><br /><br />As one more time, why, why, whhyyyy...?

				K-pins are very amnesiotic in my experience.<br />It&#039;s way too easy for me to forget i already took some (and repeat this behavior).<br />I&#039;ve lost entire Weeks of memory from it.<br />Never had such a problem with diazepam or xanax.<br /><br />Also, when I take Valium or Xanax, I feel the onset more rapidly than the K-pins.<br />K-pins usually leave me &quot;thinking&quot; I am completely sober up until the point I realize that a week has gone bye.

				Clonazepam has to be my favourite i reckon. Diazepam a close second. Tried xanax and didnt really think much to it. Nitrazepams good too. I just like benzos in general. It&#039;s too easy to start liking them a little too much in my experience though!

				recently sampled a bag which held Alprazolam, diazepam, nitrazepam and lorazepam . Was really interested in comparing them but the end result is that taking benzo&#039;s in recreational dosages will fuck up your memory and i honestly cant tell you which one i liked more or why.<br />They all did the job to get mellow before passing out, sleeping deep and forgetting most of what happened.<br />I say go for the cheapest stuff, in the end it does not seem to matter ;-)

				Clonazepam will be my favorite.&nbsp; Subtle like valium but strong enough like xanax.&nbsp; <br /><br />Valium is good but horrible if your going to take it more than a month, tolerance builds up way to fast for me.&nbsp; Xanax is best when you&#039;re really crashing HARD.

				All benziodiazepines affect the GAMA receptor in your brain, eg., while different, they have similar &quot;issues&quot; (&quot;I drank a few beers, at a couple a Xannies... OH FUCK! Who are you in my bed with a penis!!!??? LOL&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Xanax is a short-acting quick releaser.&nbsp; Eg. It hits its punch quicker and harder, but does not last as long<br />--Still a go to obviously<br /><br />Lorazepam is on the light end of the spectrum... strength vs. longetivity... Clinically used in hospitals for seizures and shit.&nbsp; If you go to the hospital &quot;AH IM FREAKING&quot; you will get 12 1mg of these and a nice bill.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Temazepam upward to the others you cannot get prescribed Flurazepam and such... Temazepam is a sleep aid, is strong as hell, and lasts long as hell when used impromperly as Im sure you will crack open the capsule.&nbsp; Do not drink liquor with this or you will black out on you tile floor.&nbsp; No interest past temazepam for me<br /><br />**Valium 10mg is the benchmark** Diazepam: 10mg Diazepam generally equivocates to:<br />&nbsp;1mg Alprazolam, <br />&nbsp;1.25-1.5 mg Lorazepam (tolerance sensitivity use caution)<br />&nbsp;0.75mg Clonazepam (tolerance sensitivity use caution)<br />&nbsp;7.5mg Temazepam (*** Prescribed doses are available in 15mg or 30mg TIMED RELEASED which is null when u open the capsule. (Sensitivity based, *****PLEASE**** don&#039;t eat 15 mg Hydocodone and do 4 shots of 40% EtOH under any of these.&nbsp; Promise you wana wake up tmrw not remembering and opposed not remembering not waking up.) Or yea you look cool tonight and ice cold dead in three day, Rock on!<br /><br />My favorite is Clonazepam: Long-Acting half-life (stays punching longer, just takes longer to punch, UNLESS you get the dissolving tabs that sit on you tongue as I do :D... then its a xanax on roids!&nbsp; Search for Banana flavored Clonazepam its an Oral dissolvable tablet.<br /><br />SAFETY ADVICE/TIPS/BE SMART PLEASE ***(You need not do this unless you have eaten benzos frequently)<br />1) Ok, on an empty stomach, if you drink 24-32 oz of grapefruit juice (Simply Grapefruit, 100%, not the pink shit, it inhibits receptors in your stomach that your liver would tax, but this bypasses that so you get it straight in your blood.&nbsp; Expect 1.5-2x strength of Benzo... (esp Valium, Klonopin, and Xanax but its short lived.&nbsp; Did i say screw lorazepam?&nbsp; K did now. that 10mg valium is now a 20mg valium in you.&nbsp; Quite whining about the taste, you know that fat woman tasted,,,, nevermind.<br /><br />2) Salicylic Acid (Aspirin): Thins your blood.&nbsp; If you have a bad stomach, steer clear its hard on it.&nbsp; If you can eat fire, your... rocking.&nbsp; No more than 900-950mg.. **MAX of 1300mg/24 hours*** (3 tabs of generic tabs are usually 325mg).&nbsp; This is also a magnifier of the a benzo.&nbsp; **START LOW SMARTS... Dont waste your benzo on the floor or in bed with penis-psuedo-woman!**<br /><br />3) Carisoprodol 350mg (Soma) Muscle Relaxer, Different than others:&nbsp; This is the Universal Magnifier!&nbsp; Take *one*... no need to crush with benzo (or if hydrocodone is your thing that 10mg just now is a 20mg, 3 beers a 25mg)... Euphorically Calming and intensifies symbiotically (I know science.. So says my degree) whatever you are taking.&nbsp; Empty stomach though again, or else your food is enjoying its relaxation!<br /><br />************* DONT BE A DUMBASS PLEASE.&nbsp; WE WANT DUMBASSES ALIVE.******************&nbsp; Benzo&#039;s are creepers and you add Ethanol, or other things, you be fine to blacked out walking.... yea walking, *I know*... conversing as well.&nbsp; That is advice to be used at u discretion. If you have had 90 0.5mg Alprazolam 3x Daily, you have tolerance.&nbsp; If you have only had a cold pop..... Be smart.&nbsp; Enjoy the drug, not the juice, aspirin, soma, penischicks, hydrocodone, ethanol (really drink beers guys... if you do drink. I do... Beers.&nbsp; VERY BAD EXPERIENCES *shown to me via iPhone of shit Ive done just at home.&nbsp; It&#039;s not cool and you can die.&nbsp; <br />On that note, my hand hurts.<br /><br />Self Prescription: 1) Hot Vaginated Gilfriend in shower, while I am drinking a gallon of grapefruit juice as a chase to 8 shots of everclear, 6 aspirin, 40mg valium, 3mg Xanax, One Soma, One Vicodin 30 (rare).<br />******^^^^^^^^^^^Bullshit ^^^^^^ except gilfriend in shower, 1mg klonopin and a soma :) Im tolerancetastically great!!! <br /><br />You are not badass dont OD, and DO NOT NOT NOT do this shit with oxycodone.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; You will die, say you wont, cool, but you will.&nbsp; Hot ER girlfriend will testify.&nbsp; <br /><br />Be safe, stay alive, peace, karmanate!&nbsp; ;)<br />

				In general I don&#039;t find benzos to be all that recreational.&nbsp; They&#039;re one of the few drugs that is pretty much only good at what they&#039;re SUPPOSED to be for - anxiolytic effects and muscle relaxant qualities in the case of diazepam.&nbsp; Valium is the only benzo (and I&#039;ve tried most of them) that produces what I would call actual &quot;euphoria,&quot; while xanax turns me into a zombie and klonopin just makes me sleep for 12 hours.&nbsp; Sure, they&#039;re fun with alcohol at first but in my experience benzos+EtOH always results in you overdoing it, passing out and waking up with a swiss-cheese memory of what happened the night before.<br /><br />I try to keep a modest-sized stash of valium on hand to help with stimulant comedown and as a (mostly mental) weapon against potentially bad trips when using psychedelics.&nbsp; It&#039;s just nice to know that you have it, if it need it.&nbsp; It sits next to my ondansetron as a utilitarian, rather than recreational, pharmaceutical. <br /><br />So, my vote is for plain, good old classic diazepam.&nbsp; It&#039;s the most predictable and enjoyable of the group.<br /><br />And to those who are wondering and would like some sources; grapefruit juice increases the potency and duration of many different drugs via inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme which is responsible for the metabolism of many biologically active compounds.&nbsp; It works for benzos, opiates, and amphetamines as well as a slew of other non-recreational drugs.&nbsp; They stick around for longer and in higher concentrations due to this enzymatic inhibition. (WARNING CLEARNET LINKS: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9625273 , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_p450 )<br /><br />In my experience, grapefruit juice mildly enhances the experience, even with amphetamines where you&#039;d think the extra acid might adversely affect things.

What I have found:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There’s been quite a lot of conflicting information about whether or not various benzos are potentiated by grapefruit juice or not: So here for SWIY’s viewing pleasure is what SWIJ has been able to dig up.<br /><br />Grapefruit juice inhibits Cytochrome P450 (CY3PA specifically), which is found both in the liver and the wall of the small intestine. These enzymes metabolise benzodiazepines. The theory is, is that if the enzymes are inhibited then there will be greater bioavailability of the drug (for example, requiring lower doses to get the same effect). However it’s not quite so simple. This effect only comes into play if the parent drug is subject to extensive first pass metabolism. Drugs with high oral bioavailability (because of low first pass metabolism) are not affected by enzyme inhibition significantly.<br /><br />Obviously grapefruit juice does not have an effect if benzodiazepines are taken parenterally (IV or IM), because first pass metabolism is eliminated.<br /><br />SWIJ has seen it stated in various places on the net that it is only ruby grapefruit that has effect: Not so. Most of the studies were done with normal white grapefruit.<br /><br />So, here we go.<br /><br />Benzos definitely potentiated by grapefruit juice:<br /><br />Triazolam (Halcion), Diazepam (Valium) and Midazolam (Versed)<br /><br />Benzos definitely NOT potentiated by grapefruit juice:<br /><br />Alprazolam (Xanax)<br /><br />Benzos theoretically potentiated by grapefruit juice, but effects probably not clinically significant (because of high oral bioavailability):<br /><br />Clonazepam (Klonopin), Lorazepam (Ativan), Chlordiazepoxide, Flurazepam (Dalmane), Temazepam (Restoril)<br /><br />NB: No studies have been done on these benzos specifically<br /><br />Another factor that comes into play is the duration of intake of grapefruit juice. Triazolam particularly has been studied. Studies have shown that although a single glass of juice increases plasma concentrations and half-life, repeated glasses of juice over three days has an even greater effect. This effect lasts for about 3 days after discontinuation of grapefruit juice.<br /><br />Some other tit bits gleaned: Grapefruit juice is not the only juice to inhibit CY3PA. Others having an effect are: black mulberry &gt; wild grape &gt; pomegranate &gt; black raspberry. All however have less of an effect than grapefruit. Star Fruit also appears to be a potent enzyme inhibitor. Pomegranate juice also inhibits CY3PA<br /><br />On a side note: Other downers affected by grapefruit juice are: Buspirone (strongly clinically significant), Zaleplon (moderate significance), and Zolpidem (unlikely to be clinically significant).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />and also:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Swia herself noticed a potentiation in effects with clonazepam when she was using them. she had read it increased the effect and got curious so tried it with a smaller amount then normal she had drunk the gf juice a hour before hand on an empty stomach before swia had 2 mg. She does not condone this but had noticed an increase in effects comparing to what would of been a small dose.

In his experiences, grapefruit juice (ingested approx. 30 minutes before benzo) has a good potentiation effect on: Valium (Diazepam), Klonopin (Clonazepam), and Tranxene (Chlorazepate). Grapefruit juice seems to have a mild potentiation effect on: Xanax (Alprazolam), Ativan (Lorazepam), and Librium (Chlordiazepoxide).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />The rest&nbsp; of discussion on WARNING CLEARNET:<br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=26819
