				claiming sr is down, is vague in the sense of the word &quot;down&quot;. i&#039;m assuming it is unknown as to the reason to the server not loading. Probably the system is not on, or down/relocating. everybody is frustrated here... try to be patient. feasible solution: wait for 2-5 hrs to try to log in or press ctrl f5 &quot;problem loading page&quot; after the prescribed time -frame. it will not help server connection upload process to proceed any faster if everyone attempted to login in succession. however, it would be nice to hear from an admin as to the direct cause.

				It&#039;s worrying when no admins come forward, right???? :-(<br /><br />i&#039;m more worried about safety than money, as i only had about 300 in the system. i&#039;m holding off on shipping an order i had until i can sign in, as obviously, if i can&#039;t get paid, i&#039;m not going to send away product. i hope the buyer understands if he reads this. i&#039;ll make up for it :-)

				&quot;It&#039;s been eight months since we exposed Silk Road, the underground online marketplace where you can anonymously buy any drug imaginable. After our article, a couple U.S. senators declared war on Silk Road. But it hasn&#039;t been shut down. It&#039;s bigger than ever, and now you can buy a Glock with your LSD.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />This is the first couple sentences from the Gawker article.<br />So if that doesn&#039;t scare some anti-drug and anti-gun shit up then I don&#039;t know what will.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is going to bring more UNWANTED attention.&nbsp; &nbsp;Guns and drugs are a bad combination to most people.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I had a vote....I vote let the DRUGS stay and get rid of the guns.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />On the positive side.....maybe bitcoins will rise to astronomical levels again?

				Either the way… it wont raise the BTC in case SR is down, because what should people spend the BTC on?<br />It may got a&nbsp; connection to the guns. I personally hope its related to the new jobs SR were searching for, so hopefully they just updated the system.

				Have patience people. Everyone is so quick to judge or put their two &quot;sense&quot; in it shows lack of maturity. Remember where you are and what activity you are involved in. And if SR&#039;s server went down, what would you rather have SR do, spend every resource in fixing the problem or update all you pissy pants and taking valuable time away from solving the issues at hand.

				hey there everyone.. not sure if most of you guys are semi-new members to SR or not but I have been here about 3 months and this is pretty normal, at least for me anyways. I know it can be frustrating and when SR isn&#039;t updating anyone on the problem then it can seem even more shitty. But from my experience, if it is something that is going to land the site down for say like 24 hours or something substantial, they are pretty good about letting people know whats up. However, these 1-4 hours down times happen semi-regularly and honestly I would rather have them spending every second possible getting things back up rather than going on the forums and telling everyone that they aren&#039;t really sure when it is going to be back up. Be patient and it will come back up. I know its annoying, but it seems like something that they can&#039;t avoid from happening given how often it seems to take place.. maybe like once every 1-2 weeks, that I notice anyways.<br /><br />

				Yes it is NORMAL for SR to go down on occasion.&nbsp; No DOUBT.&nbsp; &nbsp;However with the gawker article and all its UNWANTED attention coming out today and the fact that you don&#039;t even get a message that the site is down when you try to connect like you normally have in the past is leading many to wonder what is UP?&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe it is just a coincidence but I have a hard time believing that now.<br /><br />Nothing left to do but speculate, speculate, speculate I guess.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t panic yet people of course but everybody should ask themselves if they care about GUNS on SR or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never really cared to much before....but if GUNS are going to put SR down for good.....well then I really do care alot.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Another troubling thing is that NOMAD hasn&#039;t logged in to SR forums since January 20th...hope you are doing ok Nomad.

				This is what my guess is, but I think it&#039;s in relation to the article that popped on Gawker.<br /><br />Remember the media have a attention span of a small goat, so if SR is down for 2 days, then they will move on and find something else pointless to report about.<br /><br />So if SR is down, all the media outlets who try get onto SR to write their rubbish little articles will give up.<br /><br />Also if SR releases a statement, the media will probably quote it word for word and make up some BS title like &quot;EXCLUSIVE! Online Narcotics Marketplace closed in response to media attention&quot;.<br /><br />SR will be back, just stay calm :)

				back when the site went down in october, Silk posted that they were working on a full backup server that would be online around that same time in case the site went down again. looks like that either didn&#039;t happen, or Silk took the site down in response to the new gawker article. all speculation, but your right, with the amount of money made here in commission alone, not to mention if silk is still selling here under a different name of course, the site shouldn&#039;t be going down for any real length of time. i tried the old &quot;emergency backup url&quot; and the original ian6 url, and they aren&#039;t working either. but an update for the thousands of customers here would be nice.<br /><br /><br />edit: the old url http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/ is opening, but it is just the incorrectly signed post about the url change

No one on this website looking to buy a gun is gonna use it for legal purposes considering everyone on here is techinically a criminal. And you need to be buying ammo all the time.

				I don&#039;t know why there is always something about guns that pops up in threads like this. bottom line is that this is a site that is run by a person. if that person wants to allow guns, so be it. if you do not want to buy your drugs from a place that sells guns, so be it. if you want to sell guns, but the site owner doesn&#039;t want you to, too bad...go somewhere else. I think guns should be allowed here IF Silk wants them here. we don&#039;t need to keep on with the back and forth. the site is down...nobody but silk knows why, and he isn&#039;t talking, so where do we go from here? if you need to sell some drugs, do it on the forum till the store is back up....problem solved...

				Hey Gun Lovers,<br /><br />If u want to start ur own gun site we would have no problem with that, but Silkroad is better off keeping it limited to one fight at a time.

				you don&#039;t live in america and see how much guns tear out country apart. And god damn I get it guns dnt cause violence its the people that do. But you are giving guns to those people! And knowing it! all that is being done by distributing guns through an ILLEGAL underground black market is causing more violence. If someone had a real reason to get a gun, they would get their gun permit ad get one. If they wanna shoot targets they will go to a shooting range. The reason why we are discussing this is that is the highest probability of why SR is down, Guns have brought too much shit to the site.

				Look. It probably DOES have something due to the Gawker article, in it the dickhole journalist says he was asked by SR/an admin to give them four days before posting the article... apparently he didn&#039;t, because he also says he went to SR based on an article somewhere else posted yesterday.<br /><br />I would give it until Monday morning at least before we start smashing USB sticks.<br /><br />As for guns....<br /><br />There is a very good reason the most permissible gun-nations have the highest murder rates in the world.<br />Look at the BS in Mexico right now... it is DIRECTLY related to the US and gun trafficking.&nbsp; Drugs are paying for these guns, but only because we are so tight-assed about drugs.&nbsp; Back when coke was legal, there were no issues importing or exporting, and no cartels or guns were involved in the trade.&nbsp; Sure we&#039;re talking like 1800s here, but hey, they had their own issues.<br /><br />Fact, ANYONE can kill or be killed with a gun.&nbsp; It takes no skill, a REAL man would kill with his bare hands like Chuck Norris.&nbsp; You can get sprayed being in the wrong place at the wrong time these days.&nbsp; People generally don&#039;t use them right and cannot help but kill innocents accidentally.&nbsp; Drugs are a choice, and not all of them are addictive.&nbsp; If I eat acid too much, it becomes ineffective.&nbsp; If I smoke pot too much, I lose the ability to get the giggles and munchies.&nbsp; If I drink coffee too much, I shake like a motherfucker.&nbsp; If I use heroin or coke, I&#039;m just asking for trouble as I have an addictive personality.&nbsp; See that... a choice I&#039;ve made.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried opiates, but they don&#039;t have a place in my life.&nbsp; I also choose not to use guns, but someone else will make the choice whether or not to shoot me randomly.&nbsp; Even if you have a gun, you can&#039;t shoot back when you&#039;re dead.

				The topic is moot.<br />SR won&#039;t post here.&nbsp; If he tells us anything it will be in a thread he creates himself. This started as a thread of concern, and we can all rest assured that the only thing to do it wait.&nbsp; Discussing possible reasons for the takedown is not that bad.&nbsp; Discussions don&#039;t all have to follow a linear path, we&#039;re humans, not computers.

				I came to this thread hoping to find out what&#039;s going on with SR...instead, there&#039;s 7 pages of a flame war about guns. You guys are hilarious. I totally second ProudCannabian&#039;s post, this thread is done. Keep up the pointless arguing though, guys. It&#039;ll really get a lot accomplished.

				This seriously couldn&#039;t have happened at a more inconvenient time. I&#039;m waiting on one shipment of speed and one shipment of MXE. The speed hasn&#039;t gotten here since it shipped out 10 days ago, so I got an automated message from SR. Now I can&#039;t log in and see what the vendor said in response to my message. <br /><br /><br />That, and also my daily habit of opening every sub-category in a new tab and window-shopping has been curtailed. SERIOUSLY GUYS I MISS LOOKING AT HOW AWESOME IT IS THAT I CAN ORDER ALL THESE WONDERFUL SUBSTANCES.<br /><br /><br />NOT COOL&nbsp; :&#039;(
