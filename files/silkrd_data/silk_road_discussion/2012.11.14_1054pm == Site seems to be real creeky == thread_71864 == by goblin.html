				Wonder if it was something to do with the transition from vendors only to buyers or so many people trying to log on after the famine? :)<br />Very busy now though since we got on a couple of hours ago.

				Yes I&#039;ve been getting that too! That&#039;s a new one it&#039;s never ever happened before - although have only been on a couple of months. Wonder if that&#039;s worth reporting? :-\

				I dont want to jinx it, but the site has been flying for me since it came back up.&nbsp; The forums are much slower than silk road.&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;ll have to see how long that lasts though...

				inyala, I reported all this, for what it&#039;s worth. Who knows when they&#039;ll have time to read it or do anything about it.<br /><br />But maybe it will get better later, who knows, things do change.<br /><br />goblin

				Yes .It would seem that we are back and forth with either the forums or SR.<br /><br />The site is performing decent when it performs. But we have also been battling even getting to the site on and off for the last 2-3 hours.<br /><br /><br />I hope work is still going on and this is not &quot;problem solved&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				The site is very unusable atm. I keep trying to place one order and its taking me on an endless loop of connection reste pages and telling me i need to login again wiping out my orders and taking me back to the start. <br /><br />It&#039;s been like that for the past hour and a bit.<br /><br />Really frustrating.

For that reason you probably don&#039;t realise your being a total tool. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s definately on the slow side at the moment, but you&#039;d imagine things will iron out. I&#039;d say there are a lot of people trying to access it now that it&#039;s back up and running.
