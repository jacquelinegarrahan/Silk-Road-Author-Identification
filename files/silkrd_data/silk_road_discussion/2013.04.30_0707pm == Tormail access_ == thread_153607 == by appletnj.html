				Was working this morning, but down for me too at the moment, and being that tormail never seems to comment on issues, who know how long it will be down.

				If &quot;they&quot; can bring down SR, most of the forum (half the time) and now the entire Tormail, does this mean we&#039;re talking government computing power? cause this doesnt sound like some 14 year-old in mom&#039;s basement...<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s time to bring back the Armory and put some &quot;investigators&quot; onto the tails / trails of these assholes.

				I don&#039;t think the tormail outage has anything to do with SR&#039;s problems.&nbsp; Tormail has been in and out for at least a&nbsp; month now, always with the same problem -- either the link to the email database or the database itself is damaged.&nbsp; My thinking is that its got some crap programming or infrastructure, or the email database itself is poorly designed.&nbsp; It shouldn&#039;t be rocket science honestly, an email database.&nbsp; Hopefully they will get their act together soon.&nbsp; Its not comforting that the tormail main page hasn&#039;t even acknowledged the problems they&#039;ve been having.&nbsp; Not a good sign at all.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of moving away from tormail altogether.&nbsp; Many email services won&#039;t work through Tor, but I&#039;m sure some do.&nbsp; Anyone know of any reliable ones that work through Tor?
