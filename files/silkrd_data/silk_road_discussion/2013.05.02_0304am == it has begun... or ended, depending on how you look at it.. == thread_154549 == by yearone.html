I got better things to do, and the noob forum is good for getting noob info without annoying all the old-hats. Took a while, but by that time I&#039;d actually learned a thing or two. Raising it to 100 though? Probably just encourage more spamming and then there&#039;d be even more posts like this...<br /><br />To the OP - good luck with your journeys and adventures though! I&#039;m gonna try my first DMT this summer too!&nbsp; ;D

				to everyone saying they took there time to 50, wow props.. me, not so much a forums posting guy... unless i think i have something to contribute..&nbsp; otherwise this place and the access to post is a resource for me not a social platform(not saying i don&#039;t wanna be friends!), so taking my time getting access to post in real topics was out of the question...&nbsp; &nbsp;also the first thing i was in the noob section was a list of topics labeled &quot;spam here&quot;... so... i thought the 50 was to weed out schemer&#039;s and such... not a right of passage... if i have offended the ELITE please let the forums gods reset my post count to -50 and ill be the example of why no one spams anymore... or just keep giving me negative karma, whatev.. btdubbs karma can only be dished out by the cosmos lol!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				When I was doing mine, there were a couple fun threads going on such as, &quot;Favorite drug movies&quot; and &quot;What song are you listening to right now.&quot;&nbsp; So, we kind of made light of it and had a little fun.&nbsp; It also helps to be on a drug that makes you interested in everything.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; I think i tried posting a couple spam posts in the actual &quot;place spam here until 50&quot; threads, but by the time you have to enter a captcha for each post and still type something, you might as well find a thread or create one that&#039;s actually fun.&nbsp;
