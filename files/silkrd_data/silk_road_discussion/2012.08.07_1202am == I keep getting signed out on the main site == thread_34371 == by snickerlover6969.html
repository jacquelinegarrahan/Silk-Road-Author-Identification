				JUST for ur information,<br /><br />If you ever go to login and the captcha code is 3 characters ONLY, You WILL NOT be able to login. The 3 character code is a way of the login box saying &quot;im fucked up try again, and again, and again&quot;<br /><br />If its more than 3 than its a normal login captha, But that still doesnt mean it will login.

				If you are a vendor then send a message to &quot;vendor support&quot;!! Posting here will not get anything fixed. Last week there was a thread about an issue we had been having, I sent a message to vendor support and it was fixed that day, just like that. At which point DPR also replied to the thread and said to please use vendor support and not the forum. If enough people send a message describing the exact problem it will get fixed.<br /><br />With that said, this has been happening to me consistently for over a week and costing me a lot of time and frustration, it really needs to be fixed. I spend twice as much time trying to get back on SR then I do actually on SR (including time when I am just browsing around!).

				I experienced the same thing earlier. Haven&#039;t had any problems in the past ~20 mins though. I feel like this happened a few weeks ago on the old site and it was back to normal within the day.

				I am for sure having the same problem. Its quite annoying really, I just transferred BC and now I cant even spend them. WTF SR. guess thats what happens when you update shit that doesnt need to be changed. I speak for myself and any one who wants to agree, but I really do not think that a bunch of drug users using the internet to obtain elven creations give a flying fuck if the page looks pretty or not.

				Me too and now I cannot log in at all. I think somethings wrong with the encryption software, as I&#039;m getting only &quot;3 digits&quot; for the captcha instead of the usual &quot;5 alpha and 3 digits&quot; to log in.

				Damn i was hoping it was a Mac Mountain Lion issue, was about to bust out the old Vista box. This does blow, just went out and bought a 400 dollar MP and really wanted to get something shipped out to me as the seller says they only ships Tuesday,Thursday and sat. Hopefully he will make an expectation since i doubt very many people have been able to get orders in. I can&#039;t even stay logged in long enough to buy BTCs from BTCmaster. Guess i am gonna give up for a few hours its starting to be a buzz kill.

If you can get it cheaper elsewhere nobody is stopping you. Every seller on here is risking considerable time in jail if caught. If you think about how much an average person makes a year and consider they will make none of that if they end up in jail, its not that expensive at all.
