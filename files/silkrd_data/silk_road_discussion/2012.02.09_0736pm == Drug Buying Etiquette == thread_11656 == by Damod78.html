				Description of Item - If a vendor puts up an item read through both his SR profile page and item description thoroughly.&nbsp; If you have a question 90% of the time it has already been answered by the vendor in the Description.<br /><br />I just sold a piece of electronics on Ebay and a message I got reminded me so much of what the vendors on this site have to go through every single day.&nbsp; So in my description I clearly state the item is used, that I checked all the items and they are in working condition, state the item has a return window of 7 days, and posted a few pictures of the item.&nbsp; I have very good feedback but then one day I get this message from mr asscrack.<br /><br />&quot;I was wondering when you bought this item, also can you send me a picture of it while it is on so I may see the LCD screen works properly.&nbsp; Also for clarification there is a return period of 7days?&nbsp; Why are you selling this? email photos to thomas@email.com.&quot;<br /><br />Now I get heated as all fuck and write him back.<br /><br />&quot;No. You sound like a pain in the ass ebayer.&nbsp; I don&#039;t deal with your type.<br />Just go buy a new one and leave me alone.&quot;<br /><br />Now some of you might think I was a little harsh but I fucking hate these types of customers.&nbsp; If I wanted to scam this kid of course I would find pictures with the LCD on and restate my return policy and such. <br /><br />After reading up this weekend on a lot of buyers profiles all of them were stating they can&#039;t keep up with all the messages they get.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor but I can safely assume 75% of the messages are just people trying to get a better deal than what the vendor stated prices are.&nbsp; It&#039;s real simple.&nbsp; The vendor put up his listings for a reason, and that reason is because he wants to sell X for this amount of $$$, period.<br /><br />I can only assume that however annoying the begger threads are on here, it&#039;s 5x times worse for vendors dealing with cheap customers. &quot;Dude, I saw you put up that eighth for $50.&nbsp; Can you give me a deal for $40?&quot;&nbsp; FUCK YOU.&nbsp; Establish a relationship with me then I&#039;LL TELL YOU that you will start getting a discount or whatnot.&nbsp; The thing is that all the vendors won&#039;t say that to you since their trying to build their reputations.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor so I don&#039;t give a fuck.&nbsp; I&#039;ll tell you cheapskates again, FUCK YOU!<br /><br />Sorry guys for the rant but needed to get this off my chest.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Buyers and sellers have an etiquette - sellers need do no more than get the weight or numbers correct and be honest with respect to quality.<br /><br />Asking a seller to cut the price is a bit rude&nbsp; unless your a real good customer.<br /><br />Any good seller will look after good customers and treat then now and again to a little extra or samples of wares to come.<br /><br />

				I worked for ebay for a little while.&nbsp; From my experience the majority of their buyers are the type of douchebag you are talking about.&nbsp; And from what I saw it was mostly ebay&#039;s policies that allowed them to be that way. Gods help us if this place becomes like that.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want vendors walking on eggshells and being held hostage by feedback ratings - it makes for a poor customer service situation for everyone.<br /><br />Ebay&#039;s golden age was over as soon as they started imposing heavy restrictions on their sellers in order to make the buying experience more palatable to the masses.&nbsp; Let&#039;s hope this and other marketplaces can learn from that.<br /><br />

				Yeah, ebay is a terrible place to sell.&nbsp; On the flip side, it&#039;s a great place to buy.&nbsp;

				Getting back to the original purpose of the thread......<br /><br />I imagine the sellers get really pissed at some of the stupid messages they get.&nbsp; As slow as SR is, it has to be extremely time consuming reading and answering all the messages.&nbsp; I can see where one message could easily tie up a good twenty minutes of the sellers time.&nbsp; Remember time is money.&nbsp; Get ten encrypted messages a day and there goes almost half your day opening, reading, and answering messages instead of packaging and mailing product.&nbsp; Maybe this should be stressed more in the &quot;Buyers Guide.&quot;&nbsp; And perhaps the &quot;Buyers Guide&quot; must be read before signing up?

				Sellers can cut down on emails just by including as much info as possible in their listings especially how certain items were grown or made. It is just common sense that buyers would like to know these things before making a purchase. Unfortunately many sellers fail to provide the info and then wonder why they get flooded with message asking basic questions about info that should have been included in the description to begin with.
