				Hey guys, <br /><br />I am trying to figure out if the odds of drawing a single number as the last digit of a transaction are in fact 1/16.<br /><br />Sure, I know that hex has 16 digits but is that evenly distributed?<br /><br />For example if I know that the transaction code uses the last digit for something and resets under specific conditions -then a vendor could game the system making it seem as if the odds are 1 in 16 when in fact they are not.<br />

				I&#039;ve been told by vendor support it&#039;s a totally random number generated by whatever algorithm DPR used when building the site but that it&#039;s totally random.&nbsp; <br />From the distribution table I have kept to monitor this from a sample of 1000 I would tend to agree.

				I know you were told that there would be no math but there is math.<br /><br />The geometric probability distribution is the one that we are looking at. <br /><br />If the prize value is greater in value than 16*the cost of the play then it is a good deal.<br /><br /><br />Assuming it&#039;s evenly distributed.<br />
