				Title: <strong>My orders keep getting rejected by SR?</strong><br />

				Ok, I apologize in advance if this is a common issue, but I checked the FAQs and wiki and couldn&#039;t find anything.<br /><br />So basically, I&#039;m new to this site, and after I got some BTCs and tried to place an order, I either 1) get returned to the the order page, with a request to select a shipping option (which I know I had selected), or 2) the main page, with a message in red say &quot;Error. Please log out, log back in and try again. So I did, but the same thing happened. And I tried 5 or six more times, but nope, nothing. I included an encrypted message and my public key in the message box, and I figured that maybe the message was too long and that&#039;s why, but doing it without the message yielded the same results. I tried with a couple different items--no luck. And yes, I had more than enough BTC to buy what I tried to order, so it&#039;s not that.<br /><br />This is somewhat frustrating, so if anyone could help me out, that would be great.

				Did you click &quot;update&quot; after selecting your shipping option so that it saves to your cart that way?

				Nope, it didn&#039;t do anything. I should also note that I&#039;ve tried doing this at about 3 separate times in the past 24 hours, So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a server thing.

				Howdy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well as weird as it sound when I place an order you have to click the stupid shippng button and select one no matter what it says..free or pick you choice but then you have to hit the stupid GO button right next to the selection drop down.&nbsp; &nbsp;The update button only works for changing the quantity. Be sure your second pin is set up and you add it at the bottom as well. But if you miss the GO button it is a no go <br /><br />Hilly

				It went through, thanks a lot Hilly. The weird thing is I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve tried doing that before. Whatever, at least it&#039;s working now.

				I am having this same problem.&nbsp; Click the Go button or not, click the Update Cart or not, click them making one order, click them separately, click them not at all, I&#039;ve logged out and in, I&#039;ve changed my PIN, my entered PIN is correct, I&#039;ve checked my network setting, I&#039;ve verified my TOR settings, I&#039;ve gotten several different identities, and a thousand other things besides.&nbsp; I CANNOT place an order, no matter what I do.&nbsp; It&#039;s for zero bitcoins, so I know it&#039;s not that I don&#039;t have funds.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even made a new account to try, no dice.&nbsp; NO MATTER WHAT I DO...I can&#039;t get an order through.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; This is VERY frustrating.

				I&#039;ve had this message a couple times too. But mostly...(I feel stupid for not being able to figure this out) but what&#039;s a PIN? I thought it meant my password but that didn&#039;t work, I even tried my bitcoin address...Help?

				Well, I just got a reply from SR &quot;help&quot; desk, but they assumed that I was just some idiotic noobsauce who needed to refresh his browser.&nbsp; Yeah, I can figure out how to use TOR, but not that I should refresh my browser.&nbsp; wow.<br /><br />Again, someone please help, no matter what I do, I can&#039;t place an order.&nbsp; My order gets added to the cart, but I can&#039;t complete any order.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used the &quot;Go&quot; button and not, used the &quot;Update Cart&quot; button and not, used them both together in both possible orders, logged out and in, made a new account, changed my PIN, left the &quot;Address&quot; field blank, given a real address, or left a message, gotten a new TOR identity, restarted TOR, verified my network settings, restarted my machine, restarted my network, did a rain dance, cast a spell and sacrificed a goat.&nbsp; But, everyone else besides the noob above me who doesn&#039;t know his PIN can just do as they like, NO PROBLEM.&nbsp; This is SUPER retarded.&nbsp; Someone PLEASE help!!!??

				Well, I just tried one more time in vain hope...........and it just worked.&nbsp; No problems, no slowness, no nothing: Just smooth as a baby&#039;s ass, for no rhyme or reason at all, requiring no troubleshooting or problem solving of any type, using a procedure I absolutely KNOW I&#039;ve tried before.&nbsp; Inconsistent inconsistencies are inconsistent, and HIGHLY frustrating.&nbsp; I guess this just goes to show: It&#039;s possible to do everything correctly and competently yet still fail or succeed completely independent of your own efforts or actions.

I went through pretty much the same thought and troubleshooting process. I&#039;m pretty sure mine just worked by random chance, as I tried another order after using the same method and it failed again.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s just something we have to deal with if we wanna use this site.&nbsp; ::) Maybe it only affects newer accounts? Other people don&#039;t seem to be affected.
