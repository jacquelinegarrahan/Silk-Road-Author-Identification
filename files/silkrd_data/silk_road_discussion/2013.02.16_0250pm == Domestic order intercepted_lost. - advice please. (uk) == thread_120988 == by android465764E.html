				I&#039;ve ordered three times from a domestic vendor who sells crystal mdma.<br /><br />UK - Domestic. <br /><br />First two packages arrived no probs after about 48hrs. <br /><br />The 3rd package hasn&#039;t arrived. It&#039;s been a week.<br /><br />I messaged the vendor and they said it should&#039;ve been there by now given the postage options they chose. (1st class royal mail).<br /><br />Now, I only have one delivery address. No drops possible in my situation.<br /><br />My question is this..&nbsp; <br />Is my address now burned? Or is it more to do with the vendor&#039;s packaging method and/or sorting office location? I&#039;m clueless about the chain of events that take place between standard first class sendout and doorstep arrival.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />What should I do? Write the whole thing off (SR), or try a different vendor?&nbsp; <br /><br />Also worth noting, I&#039;ve received xtc from the NL with zero problems. 72hr delivery in-fact. <br /><br />Oh, and we&#039;re not talking Pablo Escobar type amounts here, I only order 1g - 2g per order.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />My tin-foil hat is on stand-by. lol...<br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thing is, when this happens to you, you can drive yourself mad trying to figure out what&#039;s happened. But there&#039;s really no way of knowing. The only way to test your address is to use it again.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think my sixth package never arrived. I never found out what happened. I used a different address next few times. The next time I used original addy, it never turned up again. I decided address was burnt. But a couple of weeks later got a note from post office saying my package wasn&#039;t delivered due to unpaid postage. After much dithering I plucked up courage to collect it. The stupid vendor had forgotten to put stamps on it! Used address since with no problems.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You just have to accept the uncertainty in this circumstance....if it doesn&#039;t turn up consult vendors refund policy. No one here can tell you what happened to your package. You just have to decide for yourself if you want to try again.

				I got your PM but have just seen this so will reply here.<br /><br />One week isn&#039;t long, give it more time before considering it lost/seized/stolen or whatever.<br /><br />I would however advise changing your drop arrangements if it doesn&#039;t show, you would be ill advised to keep ordering to an address that may have had a seizure.<br /><br />

				Thanks guys.<br /><br />Yeah, the vendor gave a full refund no questions asked. Which considering the last two items I had from him arrived virtually overnight, tells me that he thinks it&#039;s definitely not gonna arrive.<br /><br />I ordered another item from a different vendor and specified next day delivery (well, Tuesday considering it&#039;s now sat), if nothing is here by Wednesday, I&#039;m gonna write this address off. Shame. :-/ <br /><br /><br />Looking into other options as we speak.<br /><br /><br />What&#039;s the likely outcome of a burned address though? A love-letter from LE?<br /><br />

				Depends on the size of the order, as a general rule, and I use the word &#039;general&#039; carefully you will hear nothing for small intercepts but do not get complacent as only the very stupid make assumptions about issues that could potentially affect your liberty.<br /><br />Love letters are rare as are knocks on the door, one intercept for a small quantity is unlikely to warrant the police time, effort and expense of paying you a visit however I do know that LE can sometimes do things that do not conform to this paradigm and conduct an operation that on the face of it makes no sense, I say this in the Australian context I hasten to add, I have no real understanding of how things operate in the UK on such matters.<br /><br />If you can sever all links between you and your drops then do it.

Ive been caught with drugs 3 times. <br /><br />Cocaine<br />2 Pills<br />Weed<br /><br />each time it was just a stop and search thing, I was young and looked like trouble i suppose lol.. All 3 times they just confiscated it and told me that if it happened again i would be in court blah blah blah. They understand that as a nation the UK are very strongly in to their part drugs. <br /><br />But I might add that all my deliveries are taken longer than usual as well, stuff i normally get next day took 4 days to get to me

But nothing.<br />He did mention that some packages were late due to insufficient postage, ie. had to go to sorting office and pay the excess. Royal Mail take an AGE to inform the recipient of this. <br /><br />To date, the package is only about ten days late. <br /><br />I live in hope, but also now have doubts about whether I used my correct post code. I sometimes get the first and last letters mixed up. So that&#039;s an extra factor to consider. <br /><br />We&#039;ll see. tbh I&#039;ve written it off, and learned a few lessons. <br />
