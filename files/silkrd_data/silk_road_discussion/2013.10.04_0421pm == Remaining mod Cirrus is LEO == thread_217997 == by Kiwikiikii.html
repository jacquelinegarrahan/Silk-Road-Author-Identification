				cirrus,<br /><br />You can&#039;t say that agent Tarbell doesn&#039;t at least deserve to be doxed. Revealing ones identity is not the same as advocating violence against them.<br /><br />Violence/force IS stooping to their level. However, psychological harassment is totally on the mark, if you ask me. Publish all available info about the agents involved (not their families though) and let cortisol do the rest.<br />

Make them look over their shoulder and worry about who is watching them! No violence needed, just constant fear!&quot;<br /><br /><br />This would be the best revenge taken upon them but the fear of that is that some fool will take it upon themselves to take physical action against one of them and worst case scenario, harm a family member of theirs.<br /><br />It would be great if it could be known to them that the whole community is aware of everything about them but the grim reality is that a lot of people would not be content with just having that knowledge without taking action.<br /><br />D&#039;ya see where i&#039;m coming from?
