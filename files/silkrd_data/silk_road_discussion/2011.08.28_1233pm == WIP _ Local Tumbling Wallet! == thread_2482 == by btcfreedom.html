				Before I say anything, I want to say I think it is a great idea to be able to tumble your own BTC.<br /><br />Now, I haven&#039;t really looked into all the mechanics of BTC and wallets, but it would seem to me that you cannot tumble bit coins unless you have someone else&#039;s bit coins to tumble them with.<br /><br />How would you get around that?&nbsp; Would moving the coins back and forth on your own machine, even with multiple wallets, really be considered tumbling?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t the whole idea of tumbling bit coins to be able to exchange your coins for another set, then another and another until finally there is no way to figure out where they came from?<br /><br />If these are stupid questions, just chalk it up to my limited knowledge of how bit coins really work.

				It&#039;s a great idea. I definitely can contribute to this as I&#039;m SW Developer, but as you understand contribution must be anonymous, so I&#039;m thinking&nbsp; SR Admins organizing git or svn access, of cause if it&#039;s possible with Tor hidden services and if svn or git clients support Tor.&nbsp; 8)
