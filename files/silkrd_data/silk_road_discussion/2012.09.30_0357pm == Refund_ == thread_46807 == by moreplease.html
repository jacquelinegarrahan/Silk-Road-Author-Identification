				Hey I was just wondering if anyone could help me understand what happened..<br />I ordered something over a week ago and it never came, so I messaged the seller saying I&#039;d still finalize if i could have the DCN to see what happened. &quot;He&quot; is away at the moment. I got a message from SR saying, &quot;we&#039;ve noticed you haven&#039;t finalized.. you might want to do that.&quot; Then today I have the money back in my account, message from SR saying, &quot;we have fixed this situation to 100% refund&nbsp; we hope you both find it satisfying.&quot; (or whatever they say).<br />I never clicked &quot;resolve,&quot; and I don&#039;t think the seller read my letter... Just wondering if anyone knows how this happened? Not that I&#039;m complaining that I got my BTC back, I&#039;m just confused.

I did check immediately to see if my stats were messed up (I was going to go through with payment to avoid having bad stats) and I keep checking every time I log on to make sure it hasn&#039;t changed hah
