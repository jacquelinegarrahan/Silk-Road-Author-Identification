				Cut a long story short should have received a package on friday but my friend was in the shower when delivery was attempted and the package was taken to the post office. Went in there this morning and after taking an age looking for the package they said it was taken to another post office, called up that post office and they said they didn&#039;t have it&nbsp; :o<br /><br />When I enter the tracking number it claims the package is still at the post office where we went this morning but they claim it isn&#039;t there&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />I&#039;m reluctant to call parcel force and find it it&#039;s exact location in case they record me or my friend gets into trouble<br /><br />any advice guys?

				Relax----<br /><br />You do not need to call parcel force...lol<br /><br />Go back to the post office that the DCN says it is at.&nbsp; When you speak to the worker tell them the DCN shows it is there. They can use another tracking system to find it. Just&nbsp; be patient. There is a chance the post man has it for a delivery attempt. Be patient..they will find it. Stop calling..not because it is a security risk..but because it is a waste of time as you want your package and so you must go there anyways. So go there and get it. They are not going to make you open it :)<br /><br />Good luck. Let us know what happens.

Posting it in more than one thread is seen as Spamming by the Mod&#039;s. Just letting you know.
