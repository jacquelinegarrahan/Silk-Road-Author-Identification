				So I ordered a package first week&nbsp; of Feb and yesterday I contacted the vendor for a reship.&nbsp; He asked me to send him the transaction details and my buyers stats.<br /><br />Now I know everyone on the road says NO FE but I made this purchase solely of off someone who was vouching for this vendor and I FE&#039;d.&nbsp; Now how do i get the transaction details?&nbsp; and how do I send my buyer stats?&nbsp; I asked the vendor last night but I wont be able to get back on to SR for another week and a half because Im going on vacation, and if i wait too long the vendor wont reship...

				It will all be under the account page on SR. On the right side are links to things like Feedback, Buyer Stats, and others. You can get what you need there.

				you can get your purchasing stats by clicking on the &quot;Account (your bitcoin total)&quot; button on SR.. when your on your account page click &quot;purchasing stats&quot; on the right side of the page in the &quot;Account links&quot; section.<br /><br />you can get to your order details from the account page as well and in the &quot;Account links&quot; box on the right side of the page.. select &quot;account history&quot; and you can find the transaction in there.<br /><br />good luck to you

				You&#039;re seriously looking way too deep into this. <br /><br />Just copy and paste your buyer stats and give them the transaction number. They want the transaction number to find your order because I&#039;m sure this vendor has a lot of orders. <br /><br />I don&#039;t get how this is so difficult? <br /><br />
