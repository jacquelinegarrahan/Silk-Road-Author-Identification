Maybe you didnt know that, No big deal but just letting you know, some ppl will start leaving rude remarks when they see your advertising on more than 1 or 2 places.<br /><br />Iv seen it before with vendors.

				I&#039;ve got those little blue pills on ebay before (LULZ) and everything was fine. Was sent in a package that clearly said what was in it, clear as day. Never got checked by customs, and got here faster than most of my stuff from USA. I&#039;ve also got insane amounts of supplement from China in nothing but a ziplock baggy more or less, and that didn&#039;t even have the red &quot;customs&quot; tape on it.

				There are many meds in India that are just as good if not better than USA made pills..I love some of their Benzo&#039;s, again though u have to be careful ordering from India unless you have a good seller cause they along with Pakitan make allot of fake meds.<br /><br />Of course the USA does as well, but not like Pakistan and iv got about 100 fake pills from India also. Mostly the Xanax bars the white GG249 bars are faked allot in india, in Pakistan they just seem to fake every med they can. Iv seen some pills that are so clearly fake and they will swear up and down &#039;Great pills get u really high man! go ahead buy much from me!&#039; lol yea kiss my ass..<br />&nbsp;<br />I dont knw if u guys ever fuck with Fb enough but they have hundred and hundreds of Pakistandrug dealers on there, and they have pics of their stock and its truly laughable when u see the meds and how badly faked theiy are.<br /><br />Like iv seen their fake OC&#039;s BRIGHT MATALIC GOLDEN and are suppose to be 40mg..lol, and their Roxi are suppose to be the A-215&#039;s and their as big as a asprin with the A-215 printed on it.. There great for sending FAKE ONAX BARS..<br /><br />Which Real Onax bars r Ok, but iv done research and they really only have about 1mg of Alprozam in them if your lucky.<br /><br />Id go with certain vendors in India anyday.. THIS OP is a good honest vendor..Last thing i got from India was Bananakins and DAMN! they were good, but for some reason i had to eeat 2 at a time. Good though an Always great prices

				I have no experience with you personally, but my experiences with Indian pharmaceuticals are generally good. Ofcourse you need to get the read medicine, not some fake, but provided that you do, the quality is up to western spec.<br /><br />Things like benzo&#039;s, tramadol etc producing in india usually simply contain the amount of active substance written on the package, and are free from any dangerous contaminants. The production process is identical to that in the west, and you will find tablets produced in india in legit western pharmacies from time to time too. <br /><br />I suppose the strength of india here is that it is not that difficult to get medications without a prescription in india, or countries like nepal that retail indian produced pharmaceuticals. Also, prices are very good, with maximum retail prices printed right on the strips for many medications. Obviously we pay a big premium over that when ordering on SR, but prices in indian pharmacies usually ask a decent premium over the label price if you want the without prescription within the country. <br /><br />In the end i think we all benefit from this situation, and i hope it continues to stay this way for a long time :)

				When I was in Afghanistan, part of my job was to resupply Afghan clinics and hospitals.&nbsp; We used three main vendors for meds, and all three were heavily sourced by Indian manufacturers.&nbsp; Additionally, the US military treated a LOT of Afghan nationals, and they weren&#039;t allowed to use their medicines on them, so they used international aid money to buy the Indian drugs that we were purchasing for the clinics.&nbsp; In my experience, most of the drugs were of similar quality to their American counterpart, but opiates and benzodiazepines were noticeably weaker.&nbsp; The American doctors we worked with told us that they used a &quot;rule of doubles&quot; with Indian-made opiates; if they intended to prescribe 10mg vicodin, they would instruct the patient to take 2 of the 10mg vicodin pills.&nbsp; That was amazing to me, given the normally conservative position that American doctors take with respect to pain meds.&nbsp;

Before i was using SR i got Benzos off clearnet, i was always nervous id get scammed but i always got the meds, a couple times fakes were mixed in.. But many times iv noticed iv had to take 1 more or 2 more than Usual of india meds, They are good and well worth the money though..<br /><br />To those who have no PAIN MED tolerance ppl love tramadol and its not even a strong med at all.. I personally would not buy it,but thats because i use much much stronger pain meds.<br /><br />Iv gotton the Bannakins=Banana flav Klonopin&nbsp; and they taste GREAT!!! I LOVE THEM!!! u let them melt under your tounge like you should and they kick in faster, but i have found myself taking more than 1, and i dont see the difference in The bananakin over other regular Klonopin except they taste great andkick in faster cause your letting them sit under your toung which has 2 veins i believe and it gets right into your blood stream, over taken a pill and waiting for it..<br /><br />Here is a tip for BENZO USERS ,If u wanna have your benzo kick in a little harder drink some type of fruit juice, dunno why it works but it does..

				here&#039;s a knowledge dump...<br /><br />&quot;Grapefruit juice has been reported to markedly improve the bioavailability of triazolam, midazolam, terfenadine, cyclosporine and several dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers including felodipine, nifedipine, nitrendipine and nisoldipine. Because these drugs are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 isozyme (CYP) 3A4, the inhibitory effect of grapefruit juice is thought to results from inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><br />In this study, the aim was to investigate the effects of grapefruit juice on plasma concentrations of diazepam. Eight healthy male and female subjects participated in this study. Oral (5 mg) diazepam was administered with either 250 ml water and grapefruit juice. Blood samples were collected for a 24 h period, and whole blood concentrations of diazepam were measured enzyme immunoassay. The mean AUC(0-24) of diazepam was increased 3.2-fold (P &lt; 0.001) and Cmax was increased 1.5-fold (P &lt; 0.05) by the grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice postponed the tmax of diazepam from 1.50 h to 2.06 h (P &lt; 0.01).&quot;<br /><br />source: Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 1998 Jan-Mar;23(1):55-9.<br />Interaction between grapefruit juice and diazepam in humans.<br />Ozdemir M, Aktan Y, Boydag BS, Cingi MI, Musmul A.<br />Department of Pharmacology, Medical Faculty, University of Osmangazi, Eskisehir, Turkey.<br /><br />this is a small sample size study (although the level of significance is set low at 0.01) i would say the results are easily generalized to a larger population based upon current research<br />jones21

				Hit me up Ill reship product under a vendor account brotha, I like the cipla 1mg xanax, they&#039;re cheap but half the strength of western meds. Most of Indian meds are fake, weak, or have fillers that give a slight effect. My experience was very bad with Indians, 100s of calls for pills everyday, charging my credit card, sending bags with fake pills,&nbsp; I would get LLs every week cuz they had party sending stuff w/o me knowing an taking my money till I got Lifelock. Now Im in dept cuz of them, had the FDIC visit me for numerous LLs, made me look bad sending bags yes bags with a sticker an pills idk even know what they were or ordered. Seems like as soon as they get cash, u got a 50/50 chance of them sending anything, slimmer chances of sending it stealthy so maybe you might get 1/10 packages if your lucky. That&#039;s why I stay far away from buying meds from India but I love ciplas meds but only buy in the states.`

				I have to agree with indianpilldaddy, Indian meds can be fantastic.<br />Take C10 diazepam for example, they are manufactured for the Burmese market and have been tested @ 13mg.<br />My customers wanted nothing else, unfortunately the only seller on SR stopped shipping out of the UK.

				Yeah, the shipping duration is definitely a problem with India but you simply cant beat their prices.<br />I ordered 10 different benzos for ฿0.04-฿0.05 per blister here:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/cd77c35ff1<br />Still in the process of checking them out, but the initial tests are very encouraging.<br />Will report back once im thru with them and sober. ;)

				yeah mate you are right. It is almost impossible to tell out the fakes from the genuine ones. I simply don&#039;t understand that why do people sell fake meds or scam people. I am a vendor and I know that if you are in business long enough you will actually earn more. There is an insane demand out there for good stuff!! You just need to know how to find good customers.<br />The pakis can fake anything I tell you. Even the most genuine blister packed Xanax from Parke Davis is faked there.<br />But I just understand why!! You can actually earn more by&nbsp; running a legitimate business.

				I&#039;ve done business with pill popperz in the past, and the pills supplied were genuine back then. <br /><br />I cannot really comment on any transactions after that, but at the time it seemed to be a genuine vendor.

				These are retail prices guys. Over the counter prices which you get when you buy one or two blister packs with an actual prescription. The stuff that we get is illegal to get. Therefore, it costs a heck of a lot more. Plus these very low priced brands are very scarcely available, nor is their quality up to the mark.

				That is your loss then, i suppose.<br /><br />I have very good dealings with vendors from india, and did all transactions within the SR escrow system. I leave feedback where it is due, and will readily rate less than 5/5 if there is any problem with the shipment. Then again, i do not do deals outside the escrow system. If a shipment takes longer than indicated it is perfectly possible to postpone it for some time so you can leave your money in escrow until it actually does arrive.
