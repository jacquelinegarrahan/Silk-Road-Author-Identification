Here&#039;s an example from DPR&#039;s State of the Road Address:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.msg76738#msg76738">Quote from: State of the Road Address on January 09, 2012, 03:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.&nbsp; The average response looked like this:<br /><br />15% of the first $10<br />11% of $10 - $50<br />8.14% of $50 - $250<br />5.6% of $250 - $1000<br />3.7% of $1000 - $5000<br /><br />We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:<br /><br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So taking DPR&#039;s fee scale, here is how a sale is broken down:<br /><br />In a $300 sale, for example:<br /><br />$50 is charged at 10% of the first $50, so $5 fee.<br />$100 is charged at 8.5% of the next $50 - $100, so $8.50 fee.<br />$150 is charged at 6% of the final $150 - $300, so $9 fee.<br /><br />Total: $300.<br />Total commission: $22.50<br />Total paid to vendor for item: $277.50<br />Total paid to vendor for item, if hedging order (@ 4% hedging fee): $266.40<br /><br /><br />In a $1016 sale, for example:<br /><br />$50 is charged at 10% from the $0 - $50 point, so $5 fee.<br />$100 is charged at 8.5% from the $50 - $100 point, so $8.50 fee.<br />$150 is charged at 6% from the $150 - $300 point, so $9 fee.<br />$200 is charged at 3% from the $300 - $500 point, so $6 fee.<br />$500 is charged at 2% from the $500 - $1000 point, so $10 fee.<br />$16 is charged at 1.5% from the $1000 and up point, so $0.24 fee.<br /><br />Total: $1016.<br />Total commission: $38.74<br />Total paid to vendor for item: $977.26<br />Total paid to vendor for item, if hedging order (@ 4% hedging fee): $938.17<br /><br /><br />You may also be interested in the post I wrote in response to a question asked by Bungee54 about pre-commission and post-commission pricing. That post explains how much you get if you choose pre-commission, how much you get if you choose post-commission, how much you get if you decide to hedge, and what the customer will actually see on the listing itself depending on the option you choose.<br />You can find that post here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=37765.msg429683#msg429683<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can also follow the link in my signature to a discussion thread on this topic.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
