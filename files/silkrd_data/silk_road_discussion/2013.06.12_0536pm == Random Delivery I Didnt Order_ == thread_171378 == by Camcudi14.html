				So I randomly just got 50+ blue cut out hearts in the mail and I cant find them listed on SR anywhere? I order internationally about once a month but these showed up out of nowhere from America? Should I be worried about this or just be happy I got them? Whatever they are..

				I know that :) But Im freaked out because I didn&#039;t order them. Also my mailman just came by again and dropped off a package I had to sign for. It was clothes for my girlfriend so not drugs haha. But is it not weird that my mailman came by twice?

				Hmm. Well I watched a movie once about some guys who got drugs in the mail by mistake, they took the drugs, then a knock on the door. You best not take drugs that do not belong to you. But hay, I&#039;m not you. Plus, the likely hood of any buddy coming after the drugs is pretty damn low.

				It&#039;s happened to me before, the vendor sent two orders to me instead of the one. I knew straight away because he was the only person from NL that I ever bought from. And the shipping was identical, they came a few days apart. Does the shipping or country it was sent from look familiar?<br /><br />In the end I told the vendor and he said was best to keep it, so I did&nbsp; :)

I&#039;d still be careful about sending stuff to your address; at least take extra measures to ensure you are HOME when you are expecting orders. I know people who get mailed drugs by other means and had their packages stolen off their steps. And non-drugs as well. But, regardless, my point is... if YOU or someone in YOUR home didn&#039;t order them... SOMEONE did. Someone close by enough to know your name and address, and think they could possibly send it there... and scoop it off your porch. <br /><br />That, OR someone is straight fucking with you. Either way... Just things to consider; not trying to bring reason to panic. :P
