				It&#039;s fairly simple to guess....<br /><br />If you&#039;re shitty, they are going to say shit about you. <br /><br />If you&#039;re cool, they are going to say cool things about you. <br /><br />Or, you could start a vendor account, sell some things for a bit and then gain access to the seller only forum.

				Yeah, it is no secret that it exists (at least I hope not) :), but there is no real reason it is talked about all the time otherwise &quot;unapproved&quot; people would be crying all day to try to get in I guess.....<br /><br /><br /><br />
