				Thanks for the reply, scout. I&#039;m under the assumption albion is already taking appropriate measures by contacting those needed to resolve this, I simply wanted to relay the message to the broader community in hopes that those that have ordered and received will see this and NOT finalize.

				Understood, but you said in your OP that you hoped it would get the attention of mods ... so I was also just saying if there&#039;s ever something you guys need from us, the fastest / best way to get our attention is by message.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />In the meantime, I went ahead and got in touch directly with Vendor Support and let them know ... I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re online right this second, but I&#039;m hoping they&#039;ll get to address it for albion soon!<br /><br />But, yeah, it&#039;s a great idea to warn as many people as possible NOT to finalize early / release funds until the account has been returned to albion.

				Dang, I had just placed an order a couple hours ago. While my funds were delayed for over 24 hours. I had lost 300 dollars due to the btc value going down. Not really sure what to do. I hit the contact support on the bottom of SR. And pointed them to this thread. I guess it&#039;s my role to be bad luck brian this week lol.

And it is separating the buyers and sellers area to different servers, which allow you handling their orders without participation on main server over-load and as well in case of general unavailability.<br /><br />The address to access new server called Vendor Panel is:<br /><br />http://vc3vveg64kbhtfrn.onion<br /><br /><br />This address is temporary only, and will be changed when this vendor server will be open for all sellers! For now, we automatically selected and invited just part, based on your seller stats and with regard to the location.<br />As we want to try new server in real performance (if you have new product pictures to upload, do it please through new server!) and also hear your opinions on few new included features, therefore few domestic based sellers were invited too.<br />If all goes well, the open date for all sellers will be right after the month. But even then, we want to keep this server PRIVATE, not public, therefore new vendors will receive the address together with refund of their bond, without previous information this server exist!<br />This way we want prevent leakage and avoid the attackers who will have no clue about this server. Until then please keep it for yourself, even out from vendor section on forum, as not all of them there were informed yet!<br />The address will be changed later, the current is just random assigned address by Vidalia, as it take some time until special application for this purpose generate usable and easy to remember one (8 letters take over 20 days, computer must be always-on btw). Some of you who are with us a bit longer sure remember even SR was before on one of such addresses, I personally still remember it from head (ianxz6zefk72ulzz:-)<br /><br />Please note: During the first time login into, you will have to enter and confirm some other settings (seller account for example now can&#039;t have the home location undeclared)!<br />This is especially due to new personal wallet interface, which is from now same as whole this new server completely independent part of the system (mean another security layer)! And we want to stay far away of using JavaScript at all, therefore some functions requires a direct load.<br />This is also the reason behind recent deposits/withdrawals delays, as we needed to separate wallet system from main SR system, instead of just creating a bridge.<br />Also during the first login, some new values are needed to be added and actualized on yours account ID&#039;s in database, to allow functionality of this new vendor panel which current SR db don&#039;t contain (basically this is done in background by scripts, just informing). If you proceed this already now, later when the server will be fully launched and during any next login, this step will be already skipped for you.<br /><br />The new vendor panel also introduce few new features. Between them for example export of orders to txt file with values you set (faster to decrypt in your client at once than one by one), and also some marketing focused tools, which will help increase your customer base - PM newsletter for fans, statistic of bookmarked items, some basic charts and so on.<br />Simply we gradually want to upgrade the system to become a equally useful tool to a modern e-shop solutions (but of course fully inside TOR security frame, without using JavaScript), and make your business easier by this.<br /><br /><br />If you are curious what else the new vendor panel brings, do not hesitate to look inside and try:<br /><br />http://vc3vveg64kbhtfrn.onion<br /><br />Let your business grows!<br />Hope you enjoyed first week of the May, spread the Love!<br />Yours,<br />Dread Pirate Roberts and Developers team<br /><br /><br />Please BEWARE: You should never ever use your sensitive login data on foreign websites, except silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.onion and this new one:<br />http://vc3vveg64kbhtfrn.onion<br />Please bookmark it for use until new easy to remember address will generated!<br />We are looking forward on your opinions and possible help with fixing some bugs! Please keep in mind that this new server is still in real-time debugging!<br />We created this special account for communication with you on this matter! Always at least one of our engineers will be on the hand to response.<br />This message is signed of course with my personal key to allow you verify it&#039;s integrity.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQFcBFDBcgAGBQQJpK8y3AoJEAIiQjntnol/yusIALCChZM49sth+5wudmHXeI5P<br />Lu1aZuIUQdNVyvK51omKFugB1oH4Fv+X7s+p2bFrUy1Ras5qtvBQf3qo9xF2doUj<br />QvPlN20eZX7+bRcjUqW8w+SKxD0BB+Q0twkE04uQj4iggMyZWzjdN5IFTxnW1kmg<br />i/HYh8HkS3bB20bjHJg1wQVhxX8E0A4ie+1K8i8d9ofwv2uRc37PaXqPVmpFE7AD<br />bvnF9EH5iHfl8gOeRWU6Vch2NFf9s6zR2yOBCxg4tHsMarlsOjktMVX0Vh0RCn2d<br />FPheQyPgblSPOmSRYQCIfBxwei6sniCkX/i7dd/l5A7fqqjfehh3HBk8bBulfM7=<br />=mi39<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				This thread is none of my business but I thought I&#039;d point out that there is a LOT of phishing sites out there lately.&nbsp; Mostly in the TORDIR site.&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone over there keeps adding phishing sites to their directory.&nbsp; <br /><br />What is sad is they are aware of it, because they label them as phishing and scam sites.&nbsp; Strange, they should just not post them.&nbsp; Makes me think there is a connection between some TOR link lists and phishing sites, or they just have a policy that makes them post everything.<br /><br />Don&#039;t trust any link lists.<br /><br /><br />sorry to hear.

				Mind == blown.<br /><br />There&#039;s a guy who lost $14K because of this idiot. He needs to be hellbanned from the site.<br /><br />Edit: I&#039;m saying Albion needs to be banned from the site, not the phisher. The last part is obvious.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a review from albion&#039;s profile: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3193205b49<br /><br />EDIT. changing this rating to 1/5, Albis account has currently been hacked in this last 24hrs, i had a msg from albi about 10 hours ago asking for me to FE then few hours after that Albi messaged me through tormail warning me that his account has been hacked and for me not to finalize anything as the hackers are stealing his money, but it was to late i finalized 2x500gr thinking it was really him and that my order was sent out but he said that my order has not been shipped out, just a warning to everyone please do not order or FE untill Albi has got controll of his account again, <br /><br />Did you get that?&nbsp; &nbsp;i finalized 2x500gr<br /><br />That&#039;s for a $7000 listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/cff881f084<br /><br />Albion was entrusted with $14K of someone else&#039;s money in one transaction alone, and he mindlessly typed his password and PIN (the only protections on that money) into a site with a random onion address, without reading a damn word or checking the sig.<br />

				who cares if he has perfect reviews that means nothing. so did tony and he made off with what?&nbsp; aabout 100k or so?&nbsp; again the vender deserves the benefit of the doubt but a reputable vender would have protected his customers and not have let this happen. since it was the venders actions that cost the buyer all that money id say he deserves at least half refund or the product shipped anyways..half product at the very least. i sure would to protect my relutation if not for anything else

				Has anyone heard anything back from SR Support? I tried messaging them 2 days ago (not sure about response time). They still have not read the message. I really don&#039;t want to get a refund cause that (100g order) would mess up my stats with only about 5600 spent. If it goes to an extension can SR support just cancel the order as a whole or only do refunds.

				I have my account back. I have to wait 72 hours for my pin to reset, so please no one release funds still, till you hear from me personally.<br /><br />Everyone that made an order after I lost control of my account has had their order cancelled.

Note that although you pay for your order with Bitcoin, it is held in escrow as USD if the order is hedged and it is the USD that is returned to you when refunded.<br /><br />Libertas

				I agree. albionessential is doing the right thing, taking responsibility, and is going to compensate the customers that had their money taken from them while the phishers were in control of his account.<br /><br />Cannot ask for any more than that.
