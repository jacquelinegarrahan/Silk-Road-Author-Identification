				Like many vendors, I have all of my terms spelled out in my profile.&nbsp; Despite this, 95% of the questions I field here on SR are about issues covered very clearly in my profile.&nbsp; I am curious why buyers don&#039;t take the time to read.&nbsp; Don&#039;t you want to know what the seller expects of you, and how he ships?&nbsp; I have been told my profile is long, but really anyone with a junior high school education should be able to get through it in five or six minutes.

				Buyers don&#039;t always look at vendor profiles.<br /><br />They look at listing descriptions.<br /><br />If there are common questions relating to the service, I would just put them in the listing description.<br /><br />Silkroad is slow and people don&#039;t like searching far for their information,<br /><br />So stick everything you need in the item description.

				Format is important. Short paragraphs with bold heading make it easier for the lazier reader to find info. But the best idea by far is to put pertinent info on the product page itself since Tor is slow and people don&#039;t want to hang around for long. They just want to get their drugs and move on. <br /><br />The other problem is some vendor profiles look stale or copied from other vendors so some feel the need to double check. <br /><br />One last problem I can think of is that they don&#039;t know that the vendor page exists. They use a search feature or category feature that takes them right to the product page. So what I would suggest is to put a link to your vendor profile on every product page. Buyer can right click it to open up in a new tab without having to fear losing the page they are on. <br /><br />

				This really annoys me too at this stage, repeating yourself constantly when the said questions are clearly on your vendors page already is annoying and costs time, sometimes im like &quot;are you actually that fucking retarded?&quot; Meet up for real life deals and all this shit....<br /><br />&nbsp;90% of the questions i get in my inbox are literally on my vendors page, at the top. On every Ad i have up too, it&nbsp; says &quot;READ MY VENDORS PROFILE BEFORE ORDERING&quot; but still, no, they don&#039;t read it so i just delete these instead of wasting my time because their too lazy to take 2 minutes and read a neat and very very clear Profile, Terms &amp; Conditions etc.<br /><br />Rant over, aaaarrrgh!

				I hear you flaxceed!<br />All of my listings state on the page with the product picture, &quot;You are required to read our main vendor page prior to placing an order.&quot;<br />and yet every day I get 1 to 4 orders from people who DID NOT EVEN GO TO IT!<br />How do I know this?<br />Because I have clearly stated on the top of the page, &quot;new users and users with low stats must purchase from my other account...&quot;<br />and yet they order from the account they are not allowed to order from.<br />so I&nbsp; have a copy/paste response I send them all with their canceled order.

				Wow I am surprised to get so many comments from vendors on my thread.&nbsp; Sometimes here on the forums it feels like everyone is a consumer who is ready to pounce on me!&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; I require FE so that is a big part of it.&nbsp; I would love to know how some of you got the &quot;SR Vendor&quot; designation.&nbsp; I have asked and asked but nobody seems to be able to give it to me so I can access the vendor subforum.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here over 10 months, have 99.7% positive feedback and thousands of transactions.&nbsp; I am top 20% in earnings.&nbsp; Some people say Indigo is the guy to ask but all of my requests get ignored.<br /><br />At any rate, glad I am not the only person whose profile is not being read!&nbsp; That makes me feel a little bit better.<br /><br />LONG LIVE FE, THE LOWEST PRICES WILL WIN IN THE LONG RUN!

Keep it simple. Keep it inviting and friendly. And adding a link to your vendor profile to each product page or at least adding the most pertinent details to each product page is the way to go.

				I used to get frustrated with this too when I sold on auction sites. I would spend time answering questions that were clearly answered in my listing. Some days I wanted to impale myself with a Sharp object rather than answer another idiotic question. I def feel your pain and I do read vendor home pages.<br /><br />People on the forum do advise new people to contact sellers before placing an order and asking questions. Could be some buyers way of feeling you out. If you take time to answer questions and have good communication skills it might put some buyers more at ease.<br /><br />Sadly we live in the Facebook age were some people just won&#039;t read more than 4 lines.
