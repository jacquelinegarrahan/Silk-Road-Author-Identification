				All you will get is speculation, it is concerning to see a growing number of people claiming missing BTC, it could all just be bollocks or something could genuinely be up, in the absence of a clear context people will make up their own so the conspiracy theorists will be running rampant again now no doubt.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t read a single credible explanation as to what is going no right now though, seems like we are back on that ride of not knowing...

				People are full of shit. I guarantee you people read DPR&#039;s post saying &quot;We will reimburse anyone out of pocket,&quot; and a lightbulb went off in their heads and they started plotting how to make themselves some money. <br /><br />I doubt ANYBODY lost any bitcoins. Either their is a backlog and it&#039;ll take time to process, or they&#039;re scamming. The only way you lost money is if something auto-finalized that didn&#039;t arrive.<br /><br />

				People are freaking out because of http://blockchain.info/.&nbsp; The site lets you track BTC movement if you enter the destination address.&nbsp; People with missing coins saw that their money arrived at the right place but then got moved to another account they didn&#039;t recognize or authorize.&nbsp; But if you look at your old transactions, you&#039;ll see this is business as usual for SR.&nbsp; Still, it doesn&#039;t prove one way or another whether the coins got hijacked this time.&nbsp; I have missing coins.

				I&#039;ve noticed a lot of people getting upset over people &quot;complaining&quot; over missing BTC and even saying it&#039;s bullshit. However, it is only people who have made deposits or withdrawals AFTER the site came back up that aren&#039;t having issues. Anyone who was unlucky enough to deposit BTC right before the crash (myself included) has not received anything, and it&#039;s been more than a week. And all of us have gotten the exact same unhelpful automated response from SR Support.....so it really isn&#039;t bullshit. And how could anyone scam even if they wanted to if there are NO btcs being replaced for those who lost them during the crash? I&#039;m on a limited budget, and all I could afford went into that deposit, so I&#039;m really hoping for some answers soon.....

				You vendors without access to the vendor forum need to get on those 55 illicit transactions to gain access. The vendors tend to get more info from the staff and are more informed, should anything going array, it also isn&#039;t full of paranoid trippers fear mongering. This provides you with a sense of comfort as the information being shared is coming from reliable trust worthy sources, many of whom have been here from the beginning.<br /><br />Also DPR said there was a backlog due to so many people withdrawing coins. Don&#039;t worry, unless you&#039;ve made a mistake addressing your coins, they will show up. Just give it some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Does there really need to be two threads about this? The later OP should have just posted in the original thread.<br /><br />Anyways, I personally deposited 32 btc and it still hasn&#039;t shown up after like 5 hours. I dunno if I caught the edge of the downtime or whatever, I&#039;d just like to know my coins aren&#039;t lost. No one is trying to scam people here, what good would it achieve for the alleged scammer? If it was fear mongering, we have plenty of those already and comparing those to this problem shows itself as entirely different altogether. I created this sr forum account because I was having problems, so we really don&#039;t need a reactionary team in every single thread. <br /><br />Although there is a fucking retard below us saying DPR has stolen all of our coins - what a cunt. I understand people are paranoid but seriously some people will believe anything they read on the internet.

SR Support replied to my email asking what was going on and in the first email I sent the blockchain info link to the account so they could see the activity for themselves, when they replied they asked for the exact SR BTC address I deposited them too (naturally I gave them it and commented that it was the same one I still have) and also supplied the transaction details from my BTC wallet as well as the block chain link again. I haven&#039;t heard anything back from them and this was about 15hrs ago. I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one and what bothered me was why are they asking me information they should know, and my account history is gone too. It&#039;s very disturbing personally having $1600+ in SR limbo that isn&#039;t even my money it&#039;s money that a mate gave me to arrange stuff for him who&#039;s poor as fuck too. I&#039;m not a spammer and love SR with no vested interest in that dog shit BMR or anything like that, just someone telling you what I and others are experiencing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My Bad Bro---old enough to know when i stick my foot in my mouth.&nbsp; i am sorry you are experiencing this.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I am so wired from reading all the negative fabricated BS from people on forums that I spoke stupidity.<br /><br />My apologies, and i do hope all of you with money issues get it figured out.&nbsp; nearly nothing worse, so i am sorry, please forgive my intrusive and not needed words.<br /><br />One thing I can say however, and i am sure of....SR will get it straight for you.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Really again, sorry....no need for my ass to add insult to injury, and I mean that sincerely.&nbsp;

				Neither have I. I deposited on the 10th and TBH right now I can&#039;t access my account that is possibly hacked so I don&#039;t want them deposited anyway now even though the said person wouldn&#039;t have the PIN it&#039;s not the point. If they were done properly and my SR Support response that was instant with the info of the transaction, I wouldn&#039;t have to care as much if someone took over my account because the coins would have been spent I would be sleeping soundly. You&#039;re waiting on 14, I&#039;m waiting on 150 bro!<br /><br />I&#039;ve personally messaged DPR and told him everything and have no response. To me this isn&#039;t the SR I know, but at the same time there&#039;s a handful of people helping thousands but seriously they should have us prioritized! I would be more than happy to have my coins sent to my emergency address that they should have been in the first place!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been assisted by a mod who sent me to an admin guy on here but I&#039;ve yet to hear back.<br /><br />I just want my account back in my control, my coins and my happy delusion that I can use SR safely and efficiently!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72587.msg602134#msg602134">Quote from: gompert on November 17, 2012, 02:46 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Look, I can&#039;t speak for anyone but myself.

				The amount I had before is still at my account but the Bitcoins I transferred to SR just before the &quot;shutdown&quot; hasn&#039;t appeared yet. Got a message from the SR support yesterday asking about the missing amount and my SR wallet so I guess that the amount will appear quite soon. <br />I&#039;m gonna wait for this to happen before I transfer any more to SR, I want to be sure that everything works as it should first.
