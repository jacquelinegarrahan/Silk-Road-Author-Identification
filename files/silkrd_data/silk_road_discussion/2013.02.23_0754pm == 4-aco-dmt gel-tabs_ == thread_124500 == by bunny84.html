				I&#039;m also interested in an answer to this, or even if anyone has any experience dealing with Puffdaddy. I was planning to just buy 250mg of Googleyed&#039;s stuff, but having read around a little bit on the problems of weighing 10-20mg doses with cheap equipment, I&#039;m a bit nervous. This would be an ideal solution, if it&#039;s good stuff, and the vendor is as reliable as feedback rating would suggest.

				Excellent experience with one of PuffDaddy&#039;s 4-AcO-DMT geltabs last night. I&#039;d been discussing tolerance and cross-tolerance issues with PD - coming off a 1.6mg 25-C NBOMe experience last weekend; with an expectation of 2 weeks diminished effect on other psychs, I wasn&#039;t expecting much, and was pleasantly surprised. Can&#039;t provide a pure trip report because it was a last minute decision after a mix of alcohol and mj (at which point I always make the best decisions), but there was no mistaking it when it hit, which dropped hints at about 25 minutes and was fully underway leading into the hour - a recognizably psilocybin/psilocin trip but maybe a touch &quot;brighter&quot;. No nausea. <br /><br />Didn&#039;t leave me in a particularly note-taking mood, but I managed to scratch down:<br /><br />&quot;Amplified feeling of prowess - physical, mental, spiritual&quot;,<br />&quot;Benevolent-being feeling&quot;, and<br />&quot;3rd stage guild navigator trip&quot;.<br /><br />Aside from getting the reference, I can&#039;t tell you much about that last comment. I think it was high praise.<br /><br />Granted, this was a dirty run but this is my favourite new product on the Road. And I tend to be fairly critical (see my NBOMe reviews).<br /><br />

				Thanks for the update oldtoby.&nbsp; Screw it, I put in an order for 10 of them.&nbsp; It probably won&#039;t be for awhile, but I&#039;ll update once I get to try them.

				I&#039;ve been reading more about them since the event. Surprised to see them classified as a RC on Erowid, but not exactly a new one. People on various forums seem divided about 50/50 as to whether or not the 4-AcO-DMT trip is just like a shroom trip or noticeably different (aside from lack of nausea). I found the sensation to match almost exactly - were someone to manage to talk me into a blind drug trial, I&#039;d have said psilocybin, no question. Down to some of the less pleasant aspects - thought loops, difficulty managing complex tasks (where &quot;complex&quot; may = refilling your vape bowl), etc.. Far more intense than I was expecting, and really positive.<br /><br />I&#039;m considering recommending 4-AcO-DMT for a psych virgin I know as a relatively gentle, controlled-dose first trip, but want to experiment just a bit more first. If cross-tolerance wasn&#039;t a factor here, could be just right. If it was, though, could actually be a tad strong.

				I&#039;m interested in these too, tried the powder 4-Aco-DMT &amp; had great experiences with it, but what I&#039;ve got left now has degraded/melted/oxidised into a black blob so these gel tabs sound attractive. Would be interested to hear any reports on these.

				Nice one to all the people who are buying/reviewing. Just to let y&#039;all know, especially those in the UK, Jesus of Rave has just started a poll asking if people would be interested in 4-aco-dmt. Go vote!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46574.2025;topicseen<br /><br />Edit: Seems like they&#039;re already probably going for it. Apparently it will be the cheapest on SR, and they&#039;ll probably end up doing gel tabs. Still, go vote to make them certain! Also, something from that thread that might interest people... <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just a quick heads up, please make sure that it is a crystalline white powder if you do continue through with this.

Unfortunately this degradation from 4-AcO-DMT to 4-HO-DMT happens extremely quickly if not properly vacuum sealed, and because people buy bulk but can&#039;t sell it quickly, there are a lot of vendors peddling degraded 4-AcO-DMT in the brown, goeey form and stating there is no difference. This is entirely false.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No idea if this is true or not, but something to look into no doubt.

				Trip report with puffdaddy&#039;s 4-aco-dmt feel tabs.&nbsp; This was my first experience with 4-aco-dmt. I took a full tab (10 mg) on a full very full stomach. About an hour and a half later I was bummed because I was only experiencing barely noticeable effects and thought I got ripped off. Somewhere between the second and third hour I started realizing I was smiling so hard it hurt. From there on out it was general euphoria. Jokes were so funny at times that I cried, slight shades of color were very noticeable, couldn&#039;t tell if I was warm or cold, etc. This peaked for probably just under 2 hours. Total duration (once I felt it) was a little over 5 hours. No open eyed or closed eye visuals. Clear headed enough that I could have normal conversations with sober people fine. No nausea at all. A no point would I was actually tripping, but I felt right on the verge of it. As many people have said in the past, I found it very similar to a shroom trip. <br /><br />Also, a friend also took a full gel tab, and experienced about the same effects, however he felt it with a quicker onset (could feel the effects by the end of the first hour). So I attribute my slow onset to taking it on a full stomach.<br /><br />I just wanted to update the community for anyone on the fence about this. In the future if I want to really trip, I will probably take one and a half to two tabs (15-20 mg). But one tab is great for a first time using it and would be ideal for social situations where you have to interact with a lot of other people. I would recommend these and though i have eight left, im already thinking about getting more.<br /><br />Also, thanks for the heads up oldcactushand. I would definitely recommend puffdaddy&#039;s tabs, however I would be interested in JoR&#039;s product as well.

Presence of moisture perhaps? (which was what I&#039;d suspected of causing the &#039;degradation&#039;). But what would happen to the extra 2 Oxygens (H2O), mix with the acetyl? so the gooey degraded 4-AcO-DMT could be 4-HO-DMT &amp; A2O.<br />Does that sound possible?<br /><br />Would love to hear from someone who knows their chemistry on this. What would cause this change, and so what would be a good storage method to avoid it (eg would dissolving in water/alcohol, etc speed the change or prevent it?<br /><br />Anyway sounds like there isn&#039;t much point buying 4-AcO-DMT in bulk, unless your interested in getting 4-HO-DMT. The gel tabs seem like the way to go, shame they&#039;re so pricey compared to powder.<br /><br />I see that The Jolly Roger is selling these gel tabs too, advertised at 12mg.
