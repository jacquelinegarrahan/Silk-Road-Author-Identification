				Well I went through to try and raise money with no success. <br />Believe, what you will, but this was no scam. <br />Just a person trying to help another person in need.<br />Even though I recieved no help, I still was able to take out the refund the road gave him, and that will go straight to his fund.<br /><br />I wrote a letter to the dread pirate Roberts thanking him and assuming he saw the thread I posted. He responded shortly with, &quot;He has a good friend in you.&nbsp; Godspeed!&quot;<br />I will admit I didn&#039;t think the dread pirate Roberts himself would respond to my message. So I say thank you to him again, for being so kind.<br /><br />Also to something dingo said in another thread, he definitely didnt own a lambragini, only was caught with a little over a kilo, and didnt have significant weight of marijuana. They want to include everything that was confiscated from the other drug dealers that are connected to him in the weight total, saying he supplied it. There really is no way they should be able to prove he gave it to them as he did cover himself well. <br /><br />I bid you all adieu, there is no need to donate as I will not be checking his account. Instead send positive energy his way, in hope that this horrible thing will be reversed,<br />Steve

				Look, your story was full of holes and made little sense.&nbsp; If the story is true, then of course we hope your friend will be okay, but you can&#039;t come here with a weird story, claim to be a newbie but also know so much about how SR works, make a very rare spelling mistake that was previously made by Chaosforpeace himself, spam a bunch of threads asking for donations, and expect us to believe you.&nbsp; People come here every day to scam others out of their btc with fake sob stories - people claiming they have cancer when they don&#039;t, people claiming their child has some rare disease when they don&#039;t, etc.&nbsp; People have every right to question claims like these especially when they sound so much like a scam and things just don&#039;t add up.

				Maybe the misspelling is a regional thing, who knows, but it doesn&#039;t matter, scam or not, glad things worked out and you got some money to hep your friend. Scout&#039;s right this happens all the time. And SR users do incredible investigating &#039;allot&#039; of us are truth seekers and even when there&#039;s nothing in it for us we want to get to the bottom of stories such as yours. Never underestimate SR forums haha.<br /><br />Goodluck.<br /><br />if the &#039;real&#039; chaos ever comes back on here maybe he&#039;ll be able to fill in those holes.

				I would not be surprised if Chaos was busted.&nbsp; I&#039;ve thought about it before while reading his posts.&nbsp; He said he got raided and the police found sheets of tyler tabs and he told them what they were.&nbsp; He told the forum about it then asked how to beat dr4ug tests because he still wants to do drugs.&nbsp; NOW YOU TELL ME THIS, how many people do you think were caught with sheets tyler tabs i the US that week?&nbsp; Seriously, you can go on SR and look at the photos of what they look like.&nbsp; Then he continues making orders.&nbsp; Come on kid, get a new hobby.<br /><br />Scam or not, he was one of the lowest hanging fruits on the forum.

				SR forum users and mods are like fucking Sherlock Holmes.&nbsp; You can&#039;t pull a fast one on dem keen eyes. <br /><br />Terrible story.&nbsp; &nbsp;I often think that profiles here with mega post counts are the top of the targets to watch.&nbsp; Ringleaders so to speak, it would make sense to start with them first since its so easy to piece together facts across many posts. They are now showing up in google too.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Popularity here isn&#039;t worth the risks, really.&nbsp; &nbsp;Blending in to the crowd is key, unless you play a tight game and got a lawyer on speed dial. <br /><br />As stated many times,&nbsp; high post counts sometimes means a blabber-mouth with a fetish for social media more than a expert.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A lot of teens and young adults have such time on their hands and experts are usually busy earning a living and not handing out advice like a &#039;dear Abby&#039; newspaper column.&nbsp; &nbsp;But hey, sharing the knowledge is nice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Aside from the obvious, this is still a good story with kind intentions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cheers for being human and reaching out. <br />Boo for not taking more time to plan this.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				I still can&#039;t believe that someone would come onto the forums on behalf of someone else and ask for money to help bail out their friend who got caught because of his own ignorance and rookie mistakes. If it was not a scam(which I think it is) then Chaos is not a very good drug dealer and should probably stop.
