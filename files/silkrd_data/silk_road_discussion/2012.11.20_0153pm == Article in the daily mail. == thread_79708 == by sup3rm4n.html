				That articles nothing new goverments, senators, anti drug leagues (mostly mothers of teenage kids who died from drugs purchased on SR) have been protesting to get the DEA,FBI, and CIA to shutdown this site. Australian customs have been intercepting most of the SilkRoad packages as they call em, they say they can now easily recognize how Vendors ship. This sites open to anyone such as government, 12 yr olds,groups pentitioning local gov reps to shut this down. Itll never be a closed or private site, this is a money maker, DPR was featured in the Forbs Fortune for making millions in profit, that&#039;s publicity. Questions not who knows about Silkroad, its who doesn&#039;t know about SilkRoad.

				Oh read the article where they totally blow up stealth shipping techniques used by `vendors`. Sucks but the post office now knows what a suspicious package looks like or to report continious packages that look a certain way to the Customs Officers, Dea and FDA I believe it said.

				If they knew what some of the stealth shipping methods look like, they could identify some packages, but there&#039;s no way they could know that they are identifying all the packages, or even most of them. There&#039;s no way for them to know how many other drug packages are in the mail system. Even if they identified 100% of drug packages, they could only be identifying 10% for all they know.<br /><br />Another way to put it is that they could have a low false positive rate but a high false negative rate, and the only way to know their false negative rate is to inspect all packages, which they don&#039;t do.<br /><br />Those claims sound like typical LE bluster. They find one package and say &quot;we&#039;re one step ahead of the drug dealers&quot;, even though stats on this site show that 96.5% of packages get through.<br />

				Yeah i read this but try not to take articles from daily mail to seriulsy they make up a lot of nonesense, there nearly as bad as &#039;the sun&#039; these days. For example they have a picture dr narcos coke as an example for the coke you can buy, i mean of all the vendors lol. Also they mention royal mail has a system to check suspect packages but wont reveal it hmm. And apparently sussex police had no idea about the website, yeh right!!

				I&#039;m not too bothered, RM are literally drowning in the stuff, faced with cuts and/or understaffed. We might have a problem if this issue gets brought up in PMQs though, for which there is a good chance as the DM published it, from the perspective of it going through the mail safely.

				lame piece of press. probably a junior reporter who uses the site. lol. i think government should order the DM to remove the article to protect the SR users / vendors human rights!&quot; jokes aside... if it leads to massive traffic / influx of new members perhaos we can arrange a little d.d.o.s for them&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=79708.msg609478#msg609478">Quote from: sup3rm4n on November 20, 2012, 01:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2235199/The-eBay-drugs-Silk-Road-website-allows-drug-users-buy-heroin-cannabis-mail-order-world.html<br /><br />The DM tries its hand.<br /><br />Whats all your thoughts on this piece of press??<br /><br />The comment section was hilarious i thought, wow, i mean people are so uninformed its actually funny!<br /><br />&quot;Isn&#039;t it about time certain web sites were blockled?&quot; &lt;-------------actual quote, copied and pasted. haha I laugh in your face malcolm from the midlands, you sir are a complete fool!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
