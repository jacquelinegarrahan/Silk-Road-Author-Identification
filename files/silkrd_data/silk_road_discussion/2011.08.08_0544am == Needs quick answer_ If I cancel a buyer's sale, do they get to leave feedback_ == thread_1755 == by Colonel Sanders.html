				I have a buyer that I&#039;m pretty sure received his order (delivery confirmation says it was delivered) but is claiming he didn&#039;t.&nbsp; Since I am not a large-time seller and have to live in fear of the shitty new rating system, I&#039;m thinking of just cancelling the order so the buyer will receive his Bitcoins back and instructing him never to purchase from me again.<br /><br />If you cancel an order as a seller, does the buyer still get to leave feedback?&nbsp;

				I wondered this myself, and it seems the answer is No, they cannot comment.<br /><br />One buyer and I had agreed that I would give him a refund due to a complication , he said we would work thru it with the &#039;resolve&#039; feature , and if i gave a full refund he would give 5/5<br /><br />Later he sent me a message , and maybe i was misinterpreting it , but it almost sounded like he wanted me to BUY the 5/5 rating for more than the refund would have been.<br /><br />Anyways, his proposal sounded a little fishy, io don&#039;t feel i should have to &quot;buy&quot; my feedback<br />I just canceled the transaction , he got 100% of his money back and there was no new comments left.

				Thank you, sir!<br /><br />I went ahead and canceled it.&nbsp; I&#039;m reasonably certain the buyer is lying about not receiving his product, but I can&#039;t afford the negative feedback by fighting it in resolution (since buyers get to leave feedback on those and I expect this buyer would stick to his story).<br /><br />Sucks.&nbsp; I&#039;ll end up charging more to other buyers for this kind of crap.<br /><br />I&#039;d never give out a buyer&#039;s info, but it makes me wish we had a blacklist for buyers that claim not to receive product.&nbsp; Or an ability to flag a user&#039;s account any time they claim to not have received product where only Silk Road admin could see it.

				I think if case is in resolution center, then buyer can leave a feedback even you issue him a refund. (that sucks because he has a last word :(<br />But if case is not and vendor decide to cancel, then hes not able to leave an feedback.
