				I fucked up and forgot that I have to go to outpatient rehab class tonight and tested out my first stash of mdpv that i have had in over a year. I only did a 5mg bump but it is pretty strong shit. I am not incapacitated, I just returned from taking an exam in a college class, and did well on the test and did so without arising any strange looks from teacher or peers. However, that was not a setting where they know I have a history with drugs. Any advice besides not go as I have to or else risk jail time. I don&#039;t think I will be obvious in another 2 hours but the anxiety will be almost unbearable.<br /><br />Not going or other drugs to reduce the anxiety are not an option, unless they are OTC and UA safe.

				The best advice anyone can give you is to be a more responsible drug user.

				Oh Grizzly!<br /><br />My buddy used to beat out-patient drug tests by spraying some cleaner in the sample. It returns from the lab, &quot;could not be analyzed&quot; or something. I wish I knew more.

				Are you certain you&#039;ll go directly to jail if you &quot;forget&quot; just that one, and call your supervisor &quot;in a panic&quot; tomorrow evening crying about having completely forgotten it (valentine day, girl kept you up late, stayed the morning after etc...) and pleading for it to be rescheduled and not get shot in the head ?<br /><br />Other idea, less pleasant, if jail is unavoidable if you miss it : you can have an accident preventing you to go. But a real one. You&#039;ll have to break something. It will hurt as a bitch. Choose what hell you&#039;ll prefer. As someone remarked above, it&#039;ll be a good lesson learned.

				Update just because I appreciate the responses.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t go. Well I got dropped off at the place 30 minutes early, and proceeded to walk right past the door and down the road. After a pretty nice 20 minutes walk (that normally takes closer to 30) I was home. I started to feel a migraine coming on and that really would only compound my problems, and it makes for a believable (because its true) reason for skipping.<br /><br />By the way anyone have any migraine remedies, besides sleep, because that isn&#039;t happening anytime soon.<br />I took 3 200mg ibuprofen but in my experience the only thing that really ever helps is sleep. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120679.msg825583#msg825583">Quote from: g7455mk2 on February 14, 2013, 10:12 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The best advice anyone can give you is to be a more responsible drug user.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Couldn&#039;t Agree more. I need to be more responsible in all aspects of my life. Its a hard thing to get used to after all these years of not giving a shit. The real world sucks when all the safety nets are gone. I&#039;m definitely getting better though, 2 years ago I would have kept getting higher all day and not even tried to go. And would have been drinking the whole time too... which I get tested for.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120679.msg825727#msg825727">Quote from: DuncanMacLeod on February 14, 2013, 10:50 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Other idea, less pleasant, if jail is unavoidable if you miss it : you can have an accident preventing you to go.

Once or twice I have intentionally tried to get pulled over when I was clean to give me an excuse for being late for work. But they way it works is when you want to see a cop there won&#039;t be one anywhere around. When you don&#039;t want to mess with police(99.999% of the time) you cant throw a dead cat with out hitting one. <br /><br />after reading this long winded post is the upper high obvious?
