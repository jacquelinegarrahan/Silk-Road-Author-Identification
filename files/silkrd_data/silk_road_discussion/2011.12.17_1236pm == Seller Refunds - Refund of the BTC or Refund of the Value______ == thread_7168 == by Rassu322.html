				Alright so I&#039;ve now had two different god damn sellers inform me that BTC Refund is SR Policy and that Value refund is Policy.<br /><br />It seems to me they pick and choose for whichever is more beneficial to them&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />seller peaceandpot sent me out a Pot cookie that never arrived<br /><br />When it came to refunding me, he was only willing to give a 50% but gave it in Bitcoin, not value<br /><br />Bitcoin value had just dropped, so he sent me exactly 50% of the original BTC I sent to him, but in real ££$$ terms it was worth half of what it was<br /><br />So in reality, at that moment in time he had sent me a 25% refund, I wasn&#039;t happy but he assured me it was SR Policy to return the % of Bitcoins <br /><br />I&#039;ve now just got a &quot;100%&quot; refund from HepaAir<br /><br />But its around 10 BTC Short of what I sent him, just around 16 days ago, he fucked up completely not me, and now I&#039;m 10 BTC worse off and gained nothing but stress <br /><br />And he told me that it goes in Value the refunds, not the BTC sent, well that BTC can go up OR back down again.<br /><br />So which is it? does SR have an actual policy, should a refund be in the value at that moment of time, or the original BTC sent?

				If the order was hedged the value is refunded, but if it was not, then the bitcoin number should be refunded according to SR policy.

				Well that depend on seller.<br />I just gave an refund for an buyer. I have looked in the transaction details how much worth was it in $, let say 40$ and calculated into bitcoins at present mtgox rate (3,2) and thus refunded 12.5 btc.<br />I think that this is fair. So if I had 50% refund of that amount I would give halved 6,25btc.

				This site is getting more and more confusing. I thought this would be a place where I can come and pick up some nice strains of weed but have been rudely awakened..

				As rock said: If the BTC are hedged you get 50% (which is the shared risk and a good practice) of the value back.<br />If BTC dropped in the meantime = good! If the BTC raised = bad!<br /><br />Rassu322: If you lost twice your order in a short period, then some thing is wrong with you! Check your Address - is this your address? Is your letterbox secure against fishing letters out? Check everyday your mailbox! Think about anything which can go wrong...<br /><br />Hope that helps.
