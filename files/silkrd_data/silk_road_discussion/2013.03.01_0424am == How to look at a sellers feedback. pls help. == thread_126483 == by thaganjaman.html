				Does this looks like a trustworthy seller?<br /><br />ranked in the top 39% of sellers with 99.2% positive feedback from 198 transactions<br />has 120 fans<br /><br />He asked me to FE. Amount is not that high.

				His positive rate is good and he has a decent number of transactions. I usually page back trying to find the ding on the stats and see what the deal was. I also try to watch out for irrelevant stat padding by things like lottos or unrelated cheap items. If they have lots of good feedback on the same type or exact product you&#039;re buying you should be good to go.<br /><br />FE is another whole matter. I&#039;m not a fan but won&#039;t start a rant here. Vendors are generally protected from bad buyers by escrow system as long as they can show they shipped and you got by using delivery confirmation. It&#039;s a trend now though especially when they are selling to buyers without much history. I generally won&#039;t FE until I&#039;ve known a vendor and long time and even then only rarely. Still, if you want the product and he&#039;s the best deal or only vendor or best vendor you make the call. In general if the market forces worked to not patronize vendors who required FE then it would go away (did I say I wasn&#039;t going to rant...?) <br /><br />Good Luck - A vendor with those numbers looks legit so you&#039;ll most likely be just fine.

				be wary of feedback on the main SR site. Vendors can and do purchase their own items and leave feedback.<br />It&#039;s reliable, no doubt, but really, you just have to be pretty thorough on the forums and you&#039;ll have a good idea of what&#039;s going on.<br />

				Check the vendor out on the forums, good vendors may be little mentioned but bad vendors tend to get a lot of attention :)

I&#039;m finding a lot of feedback on SR is bullshit. It seems most buyers are afraid to report garbage product. Cmon people if you got sent crap say so.
