				So I took a chance with a new vendor. placed the order a few days ago. When I click on the vendor&#039;s name it goes to compose message. My order is stuck &quot;in processing&quot; with the option to cancel in a couple of days. Anybody ever see this happen?&nbsp; This vendor is gone, Correct? Any way to get my coins back now? It&#039;s odd because hes only been vending for less than&nbsp; a week. Good thing I didnt FE. NEVER FUCKING FE!

				When the option comes to cancel you can click this and get your BTC back<br /><br />However if it was hedged you will lose the 4% hedging fee. You can however contact support and if it was a scam it is possible they will return the fee back to you, can&#039;t guarantee that though.<br /><br />Mods might be able to shed more light regarding that issue?

It does not mean that they will not fulfill your order. Just contact the vendor and be patient.

				^^ when a vendor&#039;s in stealth mode you can still read their profile, it just doesn&#039;t give you how many sales and cuts a couple of details out. if it&#039;s just gone to a PM screen they&#039;re definitely gone

				damn that sucks. I can&#039;t cancel for 3 days because I just ordered yesterday. I wonder what happened. do you remember if the order was hedged or not? I&#039;m not sure if there is a way to tell once it&#039;s already been ordered.

				I ordered a couple Fentanyl patches from StringCheeseDick last Friday June 14th with express shipping. He placed the order &quot;in transit&quot; later that afternoon so I just assumed everything was good and that my package would likely show on Monday. The mailman came on Monday and he left an express package in my mailbox, except this package was from a BMR vendor that I had ordered from on Saturday, the day after I placed my order with SCP. When I logged into SR to message SCP, and I saw that he was last seen 2 days ago I knew something was up. Then today I when I clicked on his username and I was redirected to message him, I knew the situation was dire.<br /><br />I messaged SR support and requested to have my order canceled in order to free up the $300 sitting in escrow, but I was told that since my order was &quot;in transit&quot; that it may still arrive. I wont hold my breath. SR support said he had his vending privileges stripped for a few different reasons, suggesting that he broke several rules.<br /><br />This occurrence will make the 4th time in the last 3 months that I&#039;ve had an order &quot;in transit&quot; and the vendor was banned forcing me to wait for resolution to get my money back. Has anyone else been experiencing this volume of bullshit lately?

You would think that since the vendor was banned you could get your money back anyway. I wonder what happens in this type of situation if you did actually get it...can he still be paid if he is banned? I want to have hope that he was banned for selling fake money &amp; actually did send your product out.

I had a vendor just disappear completely without being banned. I guess I&#039;ve learned my lesson not to buy from newbies with great deals :/

				Same here I posted in another thread too about StringPlowcheese, he was also selling counterfeit money so I suppose he got banned.&nbsp; I even sent him a PM with no reply so on day 4 I cancelled...was counting down the minutes till I could because I was worried it would go &quot;in transit&quot;.&nbsp; I need to check too to see if the order was hedged or not...<br />Good luck to all who ordered from him for a good outcome.<br /><br />Karma...
