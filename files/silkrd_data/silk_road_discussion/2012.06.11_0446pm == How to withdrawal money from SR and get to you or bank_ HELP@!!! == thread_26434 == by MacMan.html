				You really should never be going from SR to MTGox or MTGox to SR.&nbsp; You should always have an intermediary.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always transfer the BTC to a personal wallet, then to another wallet then to SR.&nbsp; If I was going the other way I would transfer from SR to my own wallet first.&nbsp; You might also want to transfer them in batches instead of all at once.&nbsp; If you transfer a fixed amount to your own wallet, then transfer exactly the same amount to somewhere else it is I suppose feasible to track the same amounts using a block explorer (although I may be being a bit paranoid).<br /><br />As far as getting them to your back account once they are in your own wallet you may have to go with a BTC trader if you do not wish to give your ID to MT Gox.&nbsp; Most legitimate BTC buyers and sellers are asking for ID now, to conform to the banking acts in Canada and the US.<br /><br /><br />Once you have them in your own wallet

				What captainjojo says is right, but it&#039;s much better to do it in a more untraceable way. Places like bitcoin fog do that, and they automate it, even to the point of sending it in batches. They charge, but it&#039;s minimal, and it&#039;s a good price to pay for safety and anonymity. It&#039;s an onion site, http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion

The most I have charged for an SR client is 250BTC but it was a pretty big task because I had to do a lot of adaptations. I also do it IRL but the process is slightly different and I do a lot more work for the client and I have charged up to £6000 for the service but the average is £2-3000. I also do ML work for a fee too where I wash cash for a % however this is an entirely different thing to what I do with clients on here.<br /><br />Also my system works in any country, it may vary slightly depending on which country the client resides in but the system itself is the same.
