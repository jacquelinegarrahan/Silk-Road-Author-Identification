				I am thinking about opening a seller&#039;s account.<br />However, before I pursue that option, how do I transfer money from my account to my bank account?<br />How long does it take to transfer?<br />Where do I send it?<br />How do I send it?<br /><br />Just some info would be great before I throw down 150.00.<br />Thanks

				I can respect the question... but I doubt anyone who truly knows how to launder proceeds from drug transactions is just going to just post it here for all to see... if you are serious though message Lim as he instructs on Laundering SR Coins... but it isn&#039;t free.&nbsp; Honestly though you just have to do your homework and get to reading old forum posts... there is a lot of knowledge that has already been dispersed here, you just have to put the work in if you really want to vend.<br /><br />Good Luck!!<br />TJ
