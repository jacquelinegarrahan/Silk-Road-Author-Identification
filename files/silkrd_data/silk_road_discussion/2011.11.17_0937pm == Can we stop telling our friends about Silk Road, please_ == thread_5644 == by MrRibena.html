				Last Saturday night I had an epiphany.<br /><br />As I stood there in an unnamed club, high from my first E at the ripe old age of [x], the weight of the seriousness of what I had done weighed heavy on my mind. I have bought drugs - class A drugs no less - from someone I had never met, never even spoke to, who lives in a country hundreds of miles from my own. What&#039;s more - I&#039;d swallowed it down like it was paracetamol. This stranger had made me feel safe yet I&#039;d never even spoke his or her name.<br /><br />I looked around at my friends and felt superior. I wanted to tell the world about how much greater I was than them for what I&#039;d done. My best friend was stood just yards from me - the man I&#039;d tell anything to - and I felt guilty, no, ashamed to tell him about my dirty little secret.<br /><br />Then it dawned on me. What we are doing here is completely revolutionary. No one but ourselves can or will understand it even if we gave them the opportunity to hear our words. I could not tell a single person about my SR habit through fear of persecution and exile.<br /><br />Nor would I want to. I&#039;ll tell you a bit about me. I&#039;m a professional at what I do. If you Googled my name you would find me first in the results. If you saw me in the street you may even recognise me - depending on your profession. Yet I am what the government would term an &quot;abuser&quot;. I take drugs therefore I am the enemy, yet in another industry I am a hero. I love my life and what I have achieved thus far yet I would love to sit with my counterparts, colleagues and associates and simply smoke a joint with them and have a real, meaningful conversation about ourselves, our lives and our careers. I will never be able to do that.<br /><br />The essence of what I am trying to say is this. If SR hits the mainstream none of us will be part of that elite anymore. SR will become unsafe with bogus dealers AND buyers to the point it becomes unstable. We need renewal - its key to any businesses growth. What we do not need is an influx of Internet-shy newbies that can&#039;t even work out how to generate themselves a public key that will be the death of us.<br /><br />Long live Silk Road.

In fact what we really need is for NBC Dateline to do a report on Silk Road so we can get some national media attention. Everyone email dateline@nbcuni.com or go to www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10285339 and tell them about this horrible website where you can buy drugs openly on the internet! Please Dateline think of the children! lol.

				What makes SR so great is the anonymity. Once people you know IRL know that you use SR then you stop being anonymous. LE gets virtually all its information from people with loose lips. Those responsible enough for SR will find it on their own. Hell, there are enough unresponsible members as it is now.

				I tend to agree with sickboy. The more people here the bigger the footprint the more likely there will be problems. I prefer to keep good things secret. It seems like there are plenty of people here now. But the reality is that I what I want doesn&#039;t really matter - I suspect many people just can&#039;t wait to tell their friends about this place. And that ultimately leads to trouble especially in this new Amerika where the law is something to be ignored when it is inconvenient. Maybe they&#039;ll decide SR is a national security threat. I suspect the NSA could figure some stuff out if they put their minds to it. Or they&#039;ll decide that bitcoins are bad because they can&#039;t control the flow of money like they can when banks and credit cards are involved. But whatever, the best thing to do is stay small and don&#039;t spit in the eye of an aging and cagey tiger.

				I think it is unfair to not tell select people.&nbsp; I have one friend who lives in a different city than I, but I told him about SR because I knew he;d appreciate it as much as I do.&nbsp; It works out great because we can split listings and take turns with receiving international packages.&nbsp; I can see why you wouldn&#039;t want to tell everyone you know, but what about your tripping buddy/best friend?&nbsp; Me and my friend we&#039;re thinking of starting a game where we order each other product and try to figure out what it is with RA testing kits, how else would I have that fun without telling him about this site?&nbsp; Cause honestly, who wouldn;t be excited about getting an unexpected sample of an unknown drug?<br /><br />But yes, we are revolutionaries.&nbsp; When the government crummbles and drug laws are relaxed, people will look to us for advise on how to set up online drug markets...&nbsp; We have the upper hand and will rise!

				Don&#039;t get me wrong, I want SR to grow. I want more products, more otions, and more sales. What I do not want is a network of people who know me IRL, who know my name and address, where I work and stuff to know who I am on SR. The LE detectives will presure anyone for names and promise them anything if they give up information that may lead back to you. If everyone only knows you on tor, then I am just &quot;sickboy&quot;. Who the fuck is that? See what I mean?

				only close friends in my opinion(and even then that can go wrong). Same idea as the rainbow gathering, which is word of mouth to trusted individuals. We can&#039;t be greedy of a good thing and not only that competition will lower prices like any other economy and of course open up the possibility of new sellers.&nbsp; A double edged sword, but in the end i don&#039;t think the amount of people will change anything. Something as crazy as this could be taken out any minute or put on the back burner for more important problems for a long time. We never know and should just be happy we were all a part of this(and let our CLOSE friends enjoy too).

				I certainly don&#039;t blab about it, online or off.&nbsp; But if people have heard about it, in my circles, there are a few that know I know how to use Tor and Tails and such, and I help them get on here safely, with a few warnings, about how to protect themselves.&nbsp; I see this as a revolutionary step forward, and I want all those I know and trust to take part in it.&nbsp; Just like somebody tipped me off.&nbsp; I should not be greedy or reckless, but&nbsp; show caution and good will.

				I agree with the comment that the bigger SR becomes the bigger a target it is. That is going to be inevitable. HOWEVER, I think the saving grace will be the development and proliferation of competition. That&#039;s key. You can swat one fly, but you can&#039;t wipe out a swarm. We should encourage this. It&#039;s the only way a place like SR will be able to continue.<br /><br />Soon, if not already, certain people in LE will be made to feel that they have egg on their face over this. What is most important to these people is not what happens to SR, not even doing what&#039;s right or wrong, but just saving face.

				Erm, I hate to be a bubble of anyonmity-breaker, but if you go to google.com, type in &quot;Silk&quot;; you don&#039;t have to type in anything else, fucking tons of silk road onion urls and articles bout silk road pop up. That fact alone makes this site a very, very, very, commonly googled place. :)<br /><br />I found silk road about 4 months ago when I was googling &quot;how to buy drugs online&quot;; found an article written by some young shmuck and he listed every onion that might be construed &quot;naughty&quot; on TOR. <br /><br />So, if people think we&#039;re &quot;Anonymous&quot; to the public, or people don&#039;t know about Silk Road, and somehow you&#039;re the only one who knows about this place, think again.

				It is correct to think that the more people who become aware of SR the sooner the resources needed will be given to shut SR down. I don&#039;t run my mouth about anything certainly not drug hook ups. Even if its just on SR I am not giving away my sources. Alot of people don&#039;t deserve to have access to drugs because they cant handle it. As for my friends they are welcome to purchase any substance they want from me at a price higher than I paid on SR. <br /><br />People will run their mouths or keep quite based on their own way of thinking but just like GHB, spice, and bath salts once Silk Road becomes mainstream it will be the beginning of the end. Silk Road already has to much attention. I value the access Silk Road gives me to drugs and I am unwilling to risk losing Silk Road because I shared Silk Road with the wrong person. Plus I don&#039;t have anything to gain by sharing Silk Road with other people so I don&#039;t share it. If someone was willing to pay me I might tell them about Silk Road. But I am not the kinda person that gives away drug sources or helps other people score drugs for free. If you want it from me your getting taxed.

It was just there. <br />I am so interested to read KJ&#039;s 111 posts when I get time. Thats a lot of posts for somebody who doesn&#039;t give away his SR sources.. lmao. Maybe he can start selling ebooks on SR about how to get onto SR ::)<br />Each to their own but its this attitude that ruins my SR experience...I would tell you who enriches my SR experience but it will cost you ::)<br /><br />it makes me wanna tell somebody about SR &gt;:( but I have run out of people I know to tell.....<br />fuck it.... i am going to tell my GF again

				I am 55 years old, not in the least bit computer savvy and look far too respectable to buy weed from the 14 year old dealers around my neck of the woods but, I do like to smoke dope, and the convenience and anonymity of the internet is pretty neat as far as I&#039;m concerned.<br /><br />No-one told me about SR, I have very few militant anarchists as friends or at dinner parties and can&#039;t think of anyone I&#039;d tell about SR off the top of my head.

				It cracks me up when people say &quot;I don&#039;t tell my friends because then they might get busted and tell the police about me.&quot;<br /><br />Uh, HELLO, you would only tell people who also do drugs, right? To share this valuable source so they can happily get their own? <br /><br />So, if somebody already knows you do drugs...what the hell does Silk Road have to do with exposing you to them telling the police? It&#039;s no different than if you know a guy who sells weed, and you smoke a joint with your buddies. In other words, ANY KNOWLEDGE WHATSOEVER of your drug use is roughly as much exposure to being ratted out as is sharing a website that was PUBLISHED IN ROLLING STONE.<br /><br />In fact, Silk Road is 10x more secure in the event that your buddy gets busted. He doesn&#039;t bother ratting out his friend (you), because you didn&#039;t sell him the drugs. He tells LEO about Silk Road, perhaps shows it to them, and then they scratch their heads and asses.<br /><br />It&#039;s this simple: If you tell somebody something that they can trivially find in google, how much exposure are you really bringing on yourself?

				I have mixed feelings about this. First off i don&#039;t bother telling friends because frankly none of them are smart enough to figure out a. getting bit coins. b. pgp c. tor and staying anonymous.&nbsp; Its not that i worry that they will rat me out its more i don&#039;t have the time to explain to them over and over again how to use it. I am a do it yourself-er type person so i read and learn and read some more. If i tell them then i will just be&nbsp; a babysitter.&nbsp; I would say if i had someone i could trust and that could find the rest out on there own then i would tell them.&nbsp; I read alot of these comments though and it seams to be coming from people that feel that they have nothing to loose.&nbsp; I have a wife 2 kids a half paid off house and a small biz.&nbsp; If i would even be mentioned in the paper about being connected to drugs i would stand to loose alot of community respect and future biz.&nbsp; that being said i deal with very little people. An d the friends i do sell to and, wow get this, make a profit off of, do not want to spend the time i have being secret and dealing with like minded people.&nbsp; they also would not be able to support my family if i would ever get busted in some sort and make me ethir loose biz or be put to jail.&nbsp; I take the risk and they in turn pay for that risk that i take.&nbsp; if they want to risk what i risk by driving with alot in my car per say, or going to a dealers house that is more likely to be watched and have me connected to it then awesome and i will pay a few more dollars to buy from them and not risk as much. I hear alot of times that people get all pissy when they here you are charging a friend (do i charge my best friend, hell ya, and he knows it and knows why) tend to not put into perspective the risk you put yourself in by getting these products. and what the over all conciseness are going to be. Im not all high and mighty and as someone above called a douche bag. but the same people i charge are not going to take care of my family when i am gone or in some financial strain.&nbsp; I do this to get fucked up and stay secret and hopefully get shit cheaper. NO ONE!! takes the risk without reward.&nbsp; long live the Silk! and may my mailbox stay forever blessed.

				Most buyers and many seller in here heard about the place from a friend... I think it&#039;s fair to tell others about SR.<br />It&#039;s more a matter of who we tell about it to, more than how many people...

				There&#039;s no such thing as keeping a public site not public... there are links to it from the hidden wiki and 4chan threads link to the hidden wiki on &quot;deep web&quot; threads daily... it&#039;s too late to keep it a secret.

We also have to remember that as the popularity of SR rises, more competition will come into play and once that happens the amount of things that LE can do are really put into question unless major law changes arise.<br /><br />Even if SR shuts down, I really think that it&#039;s the beginning of the end for certain three letter agencies as SR&#039;s existence proves that they&#039;re a massive waste of taxpayer money anyway.

				Also, if we remember what broke alcohol prohibition&#039;s back, when that was illegal here in the US, was just that so many people were doing it, it was corrupting law enforcement, and costing us too much money....I like to think this might be the beginning of the end for this ruinous notion that we can crimiminalize drug use, any more than we can criminalize alcohol use.&nbsp; All it does is create huge criminal enterprises.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are destroying so many countries around the world, fueling western drug need, all because of this puritan attempt to legislate morality.
