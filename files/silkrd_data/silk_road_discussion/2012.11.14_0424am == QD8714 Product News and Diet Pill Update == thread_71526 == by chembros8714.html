				Since we are down I thought I would share some news on the products that will be offered upon restart.<br />the M*d*p*v is new and off the charts good white fluffy with no chem taste. proceed with caution its really good.<br />The Diet Pills are really doing good we sold over 100 units and had zero refunds and 98% satisfaction. people are losing weight and its staying off&nbsp; new before and after picture are incredible.&nbsp; A few FAQ for you.<br />No they are not filled with illegal sub. like coke meth or and street drug,.<br />Do not come up on UAs, hair , or mouth drug tests.<br />The active ingredient is measured at .010mg. (no I do not give that info out you have to place a order then request the info and we will gladly give it to you)<br />I do not sell the active ingredient separately from the diet pills. <br />The filler is a combo of all natural herbs and minerals designed to lose weight while giving your body&nbsp; the vitamins you lose by not eating as much. <br />Yes they also have anti depressant qualities. You do get a mood adjustment. <br />New batch has been made and it is the same but with a slight change less stimulant tad bit more suppressant and a bump in the mood adjustment. <br /><br />That about it hopefully SR will&nbsp; be up soon. I give it till tomorrow but if its still down I would be concerned. <br />
