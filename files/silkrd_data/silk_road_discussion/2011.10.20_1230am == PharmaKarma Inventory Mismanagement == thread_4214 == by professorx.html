				I placed an order with this vendor (under a diff username) and after 24 hours the order was canceled.&nbsp; Vender did not msg me to indicate why.&nbsp; later on his profile page (http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/64733) he talks about how they ran outa product and would be dry for a while.&nbsp; Maybe its just b/c the BTC dropped a lot.&nbsp; Who knows.<br /><br />I too sell under ProfessorX and i never list a dam thing that i don&#039;t have in stock.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you buy from PharmaKarma, just watch out, he cancels and doesn&#039;t give reasons and NO i shouldn&#039;t have to msg him to find out why HE canceled on me.&nbsp; He should have the courtesy and business sense to at least msg me with an explaination, shitty or not.&nbsp; <br /><br />Otherwise, to be fair he does have a lot of positive feedback, so i&#039;m sure his stuff is good otherwise.&nbsp; But this was a customer service issue, and when you click that checkout, the vendor should deliver.

				Dude, pharmakarma is an awesome vendor. Just because he cancelled your order doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s a bad seller...if he has more orders than he can fill, that only shows how good and in demand this vendor really is...something he&#039;s doing is obviously working.. :P

				I have a question.&nbsp; I&#039;m new and was actually going to place an order when everything went to shit.&nbsp; <br />Here&#039;s my question.&nbsp; I saw in this post that Pharma talks about not doing 1 item shipping and I was wondering if that&#039;s true for most sellers?&nbsp; I&#039;m unemployed and getting cash together for a little recreation to get out of my head isn&#039;t easy.&nbsp; Single items is pretty much what I can afford so I&#039;m just wondering.

				Pharma&#039;s legit as it gets.<br /><br />They were my first choice and first purchase at SR; very smooth transaction to say the least.<br /><br />Prices are a little steeper than other vendors, but definitely makes up for the high quality products and ridiculously fast shipping.<br /><br />HIGHLY Recommended...<br />
