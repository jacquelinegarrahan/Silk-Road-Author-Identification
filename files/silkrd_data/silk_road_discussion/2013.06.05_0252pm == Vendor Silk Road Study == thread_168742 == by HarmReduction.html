Every upside has a downside. What kind of reception do you think this would most likely received in the media? This is not some study on the conductance of material but a &#039;see as fit&#039; free for all for anyone to frame a picture around. The less is known and said the better, that my opinion. It has worked for large parts in the top tiers of piracy/warez (aka the scene) and it has worked for the DoD. <br /><br />Any vendor and highly involved member is best to keep silent. Those are just my five cents. The less information available to the public they better.

				Thanks for all your feedback its encouraging&nbsp; :) @Sharonneedles&nbsp; this research really came out of 2 other studies I have done with SR buyers , the first one I have put a link to on this thread, the other one with SR buyers is more extensive and is under review at the moment.<br /><br />@Morganeverett I was delighted to get ethics approval on this as well <br /><br />If any of you are in contact with vendors please could you let them know about this study ideally I am looking for&nbsp; about 30 Vendors to make this a comprehensive study<br /><br />Thanks <br />Tim

The study has come about from 2 other studies I have done with buyers I agree with you that vendors do have to be vigilant about what they say. I would hope that before condemning the research you would have looked into my other work ( i.e. the published paper on SR ) and the thread to see that DPR has ok&#039;d this research he has also received the questions . Vendors can answer the questions they want to

				Danger, Will Robinson! (Hope this does not give any hints about my age)<br /><br />My advice would be to not tell this study anything you would not be willing to publish publicly here.<br /><br />Remember there is no such thing as &quot;off the record&quot;, and a promise of confidentiality is just a promise from a person. Stay out of jail my fellow vendors, and do NOT talk about other vendors.<br /><br />That being said I am looking forward to reading the results of this study, and hope that any mention of me is drawn from public postings.<br /><br />I agree with the need for this type of research but it must research what the Silk Road presents to the public, a tangle of secrecy. We must not treat any research as a trusted group and keep our rules about secrecy the same.

				@Harm Reduction<br /><br />perhaps you should give an overview of how you maintained anonymity and kept confidentiality during the conversations in the two previous papers and any suggestions you might have to add to these mechanisms this time round.<br /><br />skype may not be the best way this time but there are otr apps that could be used instead.&nbsp; Part of the problem you are going to have is that you&#039;re going to get fantasists contacting you and you are going to need some way of verifying something about these people to weed them out.<br /><br />Good luck with your research.

NO Silk Road ID is EVER USED in the research -&nbsp; all quotes are quoted as&nbsp; &#039; participant&#039;.<br /><br />I NEVER use skype TBH it was only a very naive thought at the beginning of 2012 with&nbsp; my first piece of research last year . I do use tor chat on occasions but this only happens when people are happy to do so. I do now use PGP those vendors who have emailed me&nbsp; using my tormail account have used this and TBH I am happier with this way as everyone feels safer.<br /><br /><br />I want to be transparent with why I am doing this research its received&nbsp; ethical approval which means I have ethical procedures to follow . Its easy enough to google my work. <br /><br />Abbey does this answer your question - happy to expand if I have left anything out / Abbey +1 for your question appreciating your honesty &amp; support

				Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are you going to approach any vendors or is it all going to be self selection?&nbsp; Are you interested in the variations of attitude between vendors in different countries or between bulk and consumer vendors or do you think you&#039;re not going to get enough of a sample to do that kind of analysis?

				For what it&#039;s worth (and I know the word of a journalist means less than sweet FA to many of you ;) ), Tim&#039;s organisation does important and respected research centred solely on harm reduction. It&#039;s an unpopular and thankless agenda. By all means, don&#039;t take part if you don&#039;t want, but academic research in this field is important and saves lives, so if you are into that, I suggest giving the guy a go. :)

				So I&#039;ve sent you a message, I think I am somewhat atypical of SR vendors but I&#039;m fairly game for this sort of thing.<br /><br />SR has been great to me and allowed me to make some serious medical advancements, I would be happy to share how laughing at prohibition is helping me and others.<br /><br />That said I will be strictly reviewing any questions asked before I even think about taking part but I&#039;m pretty open to it.<br /><br />As I mentioned in the PM I sent you I would suggest checking out my vendor page to get a bit of an idea of what I do.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor<br /><br />P.S. I am UK based if that makes any difference. I&#039;m also confident enough in my package safety to deliver to the police directly so I&#039;ll even consider sending you samples.

				I&#039;ve had a look at the questions and it should be obvious but bears repeating that you are not obliged to answer all the questions and certainly there are some you should not answer (you&#039;ll know what they are when you read them).<br /><br />After reading the questions, did some google-fu and as far as I can see, Tim is acting in a freelance capacity for this as he is not employed by any university.&nbsp; He does appear to publish in conjunction with Dr Marie Claire Van Hout who is a lecturer at the Waterford Institute of Technology, which is how (I assume) the ethics committee at Waterford came to be involved.<br /><br />Most questions are either too woolly or are generally harmless and being charitable I&#039;ll put the missteps down to Tim not reading as much of the forum as he should have before he wrote his questions, so there are elements of it that you do need to be very wary.&nbsp; I can certainly understand the mistrust earlier in the thread now - assuming it came from people who actually had read the questions, rather than a general hysteria but my original point still stands - we do need more rational discussion on drugs and how a more legitimate market would reduce the harm caused because people have more information to make a rational choice and there&#039;s enough questions around that will give him enough information to generate the equivalent of his first paper.&nbsp; I hope this will be published under the Waterford Institute of Technology umbrella to give it more gravitas but if not, it will still add something positive (I hope) to the debate.<br /><br />feel free to flame me now ;)<br /><br />for those of you who want to do some more background checks before you consider taking part and want to save a bit of time googling the basics, I&#039;ve got some links that I&#039;ll happily pm to anyone who wants them. <br /><br />

				So I had a look through the questionnaire and I have to say that you have missed out entirely on the point of SR.<br /><br />I would also recommend NOT asking people for their buying information and other things that are obviously sensitive.<br /><br />I wish you the best of luck in your work, if you would like to have a serious conversation about the socio-political ramifications and potentials of SR I would be happy to discuss them with you but I do not feel that questionnaire is going to provide you with any results either for statistical analysis or drawing any kind of salient conclusion.<br /><br />I hope you have a nice day and find enough respondents to provide some meaningful data.<br /><br />Sorry for being so rude, I&#039;m usually a lot nicer, I promise.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				I wish Tim the best of luck with this study - it&#039;s fascinating to carefully consider the differences/similarities between vending on SR, and selling on street markets, or indeed selling to friends (social supply networks). I&#039;d be interested in what SR vendors see as the advantages and disadvantages of each approach to selling, whether they moved completely to online marketplaces, whether they operate across multiple types of markets, etc. <br /><br />My work has involved interviewing people who use or sell drugs for many years now - as you can imagine, it is incredibly important for researchers in this field to do everything they can to design their studies so they do not expose participants to the risk of being caught. If that actually happened (if a study led to arrests), we would never be able to do this work again! So a lot of time is spent working out that side of things. <br /><br />The most important part of the process being that participants never have to answer any particular question. We often have people refuse to answer specific questions, even in studies where we pay cash for face-to-face interviews with drug users. This is completely fine and encouraged by us. Control of information provided should always remain in the participant&#039;s hands, IMHO.<br /><br />Another comment on the state of academia - a few posters earlier in the thread described the problem of academic articles not meaning much and really just there to increase chances of tenure for academics. Yes these are issues in the field. But the other part of it is that the academic journals are staffed by the academics themselves. And many of them in our field are huge supporters of a harm reduction philosophy and of a health/social approach to drugs, rather than a criminal one. So research into SR, and its benefits from a harm reduction perspective, will be well received in these journals. Yes it helps our careers to publish, but it&#039;s also a way of getting new perspectives out there and in some cases, we can use these articles to strengthen arguments for policy change.

				That may work for cannabis, but other &quot;harder&quot; substances will never be legalized, even if it meant greater safety for both the user and seller of said substances. It&#039;s naive to think otherwise. <br /><br />Besides the few oases around the world where cannabis use is decriminalized or allowed on a limited basis, there is a basically a global ban. Western Europe may have less stringent laws regarding illicit use than the US, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s fully allowed or one still won&#039;t be punished for related offenses (especially if one manufactures/distributes).<br /><br />You must&#039;ve not read my post in it&#039;s entirety. I said that I would love to support initiatives like this one -- if they actually resulted in decreased ignorance and increased acceptance. I know I&#039;m assuming the worst, and I don&#039;t mean to doubt the good intentions of HarmReduction, but from experience, the vast majority of the public (not to mention, govs) will never permit hallucinogens, opioids, dissociatives, or amphetamines to be sold openly and freely.<br /><br />And even if these substances were to, by the grace of all things holy, become legalized and accepted for sale to responsible adults, all it takes is a few numbskulls to ruin it for the repsonsible users, even if they are in the minority.<br /><br />Subjective? Yes. Biased? A bit, but I&#039;ve learned to be skeptical the hard way --- through consequences.
