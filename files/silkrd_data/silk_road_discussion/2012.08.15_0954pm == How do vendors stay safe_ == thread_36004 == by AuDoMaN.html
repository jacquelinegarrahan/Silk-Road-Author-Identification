				How do the really popular vendors not get busted (I know some must get busted)? In my mind all a LEO would have to do is create an account, buy some drugs, and have them mailed to him. Then he would have the vendor&#039;s return address. The only way around that would be to ship each package from a different location, or perhaps a legitimate return address that is not their own place of business/home/etc. Fake return addresses often do not get shipped, correct? Are the top vendors really just hoping to stay lucky and not have a LEO buy their product? I can&#039;t imagine that would be the case. <br /><br />Being a vendor, let alone a popular one, has got to be one of the most unnerving endeavors one could undertake.<br /><br />Thank all of you guys for fighting the good fight.

				None of the vendors actually use their real return address.&nbsp; I certainly haven&#039;t heard of one that does, and if they do, they&#039;re being really, really stupid.<br /><br />I believe most use a real address that&#039;s unrelated to them, probably that of a nearby business or something.&nbsp; At least in the US, the USPS isn&#039;t going to check the return address of every single package to make sure the people at that address *actually* sent it.

				Ship from a different location and time every day<br /><br />Use different size labels and fonts<br /><br />Have an inventory of different types of packaging and rotate through them<br /><br />That&#039;s about it.&nbsp; ;D

Gox than you are taking WU payments for them.&nbsp; LE can&#039;t get access to Mt. Gox info without some reason to connect your Mt. Gox transactions to SR.&nbsp; When you sell a fed bitcoins and the fed buys your illegal product with said bitcoins, you&#039;ve just provided them with all they need for a warrant, complete with a nice trail of bread crumbs leading right back to you.<br /><br />4) And for G-d&#039;s sake, don&#039;t start doing WU/Paypal/etc. transactions off the Road.&nbsp; If you are ever tempted to do so, repeat &quot;Farmer&#039;s Market&quot; over and over until the desire subsides. <br /><br />5) Trust your gut. If something feels funky about a buyer, cancel the transaction. Better to lose a sale and deal with a pissed off ex-client than go through and spend several years as a guest of the state.

				I&#039;m not really sure where the fear about selling to sketchy buyers comes from. I&#039;ll sell to anyone.<br /><br />Even if you do send a package to a cop, what could they possible do about it? At best, they know one of the towns that you ship from, and the packaging style that you use. Obviously a smart vendor will be using gloves throughout the whole process and the package won&#039;t have any fingerprints on it.

Of corse CN is right,,,best methods are ones unspoken. And CN is one of the best, my favorite.<br /><br />I think there are ways if you think hard enough. Of course most of the realistic ways I can think of involve more than one party so that must be some real trust. Either way it&#039;s important not to give up any exact details maybe just a general idea/goal.
