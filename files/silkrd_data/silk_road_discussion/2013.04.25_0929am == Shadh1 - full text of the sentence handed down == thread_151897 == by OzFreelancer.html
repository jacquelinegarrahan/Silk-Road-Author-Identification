				As noted by an eagle-eyed newbie, the full text of the Shadh1 case is available online here:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCC/2013/70.html<br /><br />The whole thing is too long for one post (an edited version appears in the Newbie forum) but it is worth reading for those in Australia to find out how the judge came to the sentence, what circumstances added to the sentences and what were considered mitigating factors.<br /><br />I was present at the sentencing hearing, which was 5-6 hours long, so may be able to answer any questions arising from the sentence.<br /><br />

				Poor shadh1, it is a miserable thing. Sooner or later our community needs to find a way to prevent people falling through the cracks. Perhaps with BTC we can develop insurance contracts to make that happen, so there is a boost for somebody when they get out, or income for their families. I&#039;m positive most vendors would be interested in paying a few thousand a year into such a scheme.

				10 Customs officers working at gateway facilities located in Melbourne and Sydney examined, over the period 27 March 2012 to 28 June 2012, twelve mail articles addressed to you at your flat in Brunswick West. Ten of the mail articles had been sent from the Netherlands, and two had been sent from Germany. Nine of those articles were found to contain various small amounts of MDMA in both powder and tablet form, and sealed within various items such as a DVD case, piece of card, a digital thermometer, and cigarette lighters. One shipment was concealed within a small torch which consisted of a clip-seal bag containing a brown crystalline substance wrapped in aluminium foil and with a net weight of 6.8 grams, being MDMA with a purity of 72.7 per cent. Two contained cocaine.<br /><br /><br />Does this mean that they deliberately let through shipments knowing they contained<br />controlled substance to build a case?<br /><br />Ok so the way they found out the date he signed up to SR is only because he told him<br />and / or gave them the access to his vendor account? right.? <br /><br />This is extremely informative .<br /><br />Thanks Ozfreelancer<br /><br />

				Well, I didn&#039;t read most of your post to tell you the truth, you were right re : Yoda... So I guess I will listen to our wise Star Wars pseudonym using convicted felon. You can always trust a felon !&nbsp; But I generally ask for advice from career criminals who have never been caught . That&#039;s just me... The advice from those caught is usually painfully obvious...that is also just me though. <br /><br />Wisdom comes from experience.
