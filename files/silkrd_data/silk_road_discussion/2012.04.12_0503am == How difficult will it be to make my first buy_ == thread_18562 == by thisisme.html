				Is it typical for Tony(or any vendor) to not sell to a buyer with 0 transactions? My order has been processing for about 24 hours now with no option to FE, and I saw that others have been making orders today with success.&nbsp; I realize that Tony and various vendors have been treated like shit by these shitty buyers. Ive read his forum and others. Hell i was excited about a domestic h vendor but then scammer.&nbsp; So i decided, 5 day shipping from canada is worth the wait.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ive been a long time lurker here but i decided to start buying because opiates are getting harder and harder to come by. <br /><br />So, is there anything I can do so that a vendor will give me a chance? Is it just Tony thats kinda skiddish about selling to a new buyer due to recent abuse from a particular buyer, or most vendors?&nbsp; If so, who will sell to me? I want H or opana.<br /><br />I know ill have to FE but only willing to do that to the select few champion vendors.

				I bought a fair lot of books first, then made a small-time purchase that I FE&#039;d.<br />Then once it shows that I&#039;ve ordered some, and I&#039;m alright, then I&#039;ll get something bigger.<br /><br />Ofc. You&#039;ll probably have to FE a lot until you&#039;re trsusted.<br />Your order is still processing, so Tony hasn&#039;t done anything with you yet.<br /><br />Stick to the well-known vendors, then they&#039;ll see you&#039;re alright with your transactions, you should be good from there on in.<br />I&#039;m not sure about Tony, never heard of him (probs sells things that don&#039;t interest me)<br /><br />I don&#039;t think vendors will be &quot;skiddish&quot; about selling to new SR buyers, if they FE.

				Tony gets LOTS of orders on a daily basis, so processing should take at least a day, most likely two.&nbsp; <br /><br />If your order is still in processing, just wait and he will get to it once he gets to it.&nbsp; If its your first transaction, he will probably have you FE, but there&#039;s probably no better vendor to FE for than Tony.&nbsp; The guy takes care of his customers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just have patience, and welcome to the road.

				Your first buy is nerve wracking and when you pick a busy vendor, you&#039;ve got that anxiety tied up with paranoia that the vendor won&#039;t sell to a newb, or wants you to FE and then you start thinking they&#039;re gonna run off with your coins!<br />For my first buys I sent messages to the vendors I was contemplating purchasing from, just to introduce myself and give them a h/up I might be buying from them! HOT TIP - Most if not ALL vendors will reply to your questions, some more promptly and informative than others! Just be polite!<br /><br />Wait, be patient and the goodness will come!

				most vendors will sell to you but they will ask you FE. so pick you first few vendors carefully buy using well known trusted vendors like tony and many others, once you have over 10sales nearly all vendors will sell to you and you can start to use new vendors that you would have thought twice about before cos they will no longer ask for FE.&nbsp; :)

				Its difficult to make your first buy if you dont want to FE. I suggest making small purchases before diving in head first. Remember to carefully choose the vendors you purchase from as well.

				OP,<br /><br />Just a few things. WE&#039;VE all been there, you can&#039;t make your 100th purchase before you&#039;ve made your first. You&#039;ve obviously done this the slow organic way. Watching forums, asking questions, drawing conclusions based on evidence, rationale, and logic rather than greed ( ICANHAZKILOFDUTCHMDMAFORCHEAP?) Tony is without a doubt my got to guy in all but a few categories (only because he doesn&#039;t sell em :P ) It is a waiting game, and I am not any better at it now than i was 8 months ago when i joined, i make sure to have tons of cannabis to combate (or perpetuate?) the anxiety and paranoia. Also, someone suggested getting some benzos with every order for those last few days when you know, &quot;it will be here tommorow&quot;&nbsp; so real quick<br /><br />you&#039;re doing great<br />patience<br />welcome to the club<br /><br />Tony&#039;s shipping is quick too, believe me, and there are other GREAT vendors out there as well, But the highest ranked are also the most busy, as someone said, a heads up to tony via pm might not have been the worst idea, doesn&#039;t matter now anyway, he will process it as soon as he gets to it and you will be happy he did.<br /><br />Be Safe Out There<br />ggg

				It sounds like he just hasn&#039;t got round to your order yet.. I wouldn&#039;t worry. He&#039;ll probs ask you to finalise early but you&#039;ll have to do that for the first few transactions.<br /><br />When I first started I always messaged the vendors first to introduce myself and make sure they would be happy to deal with me.<br /><br />Never had any problems and some vendors i.e. Chemical Brothers didn&#039;t even ask me to finalise early.<br /><br />All the best mate and welcome :)

				Great answers guys. Appreciate the help.&nbsp; ggg, thats exactly how I went about it. Took my time, lurked forums, checked out vendors.&nbsp; Got excited about that domestic H vendor, kept an eye on him, noticed no actual reviews which confused me. Sure enough, scammer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Im not too concerned about FE with vendors like Tony, after all he cares about his reputation and his customers, which is great.<br /><br />But its been a little over 24 hours since ive ordered. My only concern is, I ordered just a few hours before SR went down the other day.&nbsp; I wonder if maybe he&#039;s overlooked my order(not sure if thats even possible) or if it got bugged in some way. Or im just anxious lol.<br /><br />So customers of Tony, what is the typical processing time until I can actually FE and get the ball rolling?&nbsp; Can it really be 48 hours until he actually gets to mine as Delueze said? <br /><br />Btw, Im not upset with Tony in anyway, I see what the dude has to offer, i bet he really is busy.

				Hi Thisisme:<br /><br />I guess I was lucky on my first purchases. I have never been asked to FE by any vendor yet and have about 5 drug orders(3 more pending) and 5 bitcoin purchases so far. Some have been in the over $300 range. I was mentored on how to really get going on SR by HybridMike after I lurked for 2 weeks on the site and got brave enough to ask for help. That Coke vendor had great reviews, longevity on SR and was certainly friendly, gentle and prompt with his messages to me. Then....yikes... he scammed a whole bunch of people by using FE in a &quot;feel the love&quot; sale over valentine&#039;s day. If I hadn&#039;t had to wait 2 weeks to get bitcoins (a major bitcoin exchange: Tradehill, bit the dust just when I tried to get my first coin), I would have had a very sour first experience on SR. As it turned out, I got bitcoins from Sugar Mama (still using her), and made successful purchases from Dankalicious (Dank), PaperChasing (PC), Moveitnice (min), Godofall (GOA). I guess these guys have either not been scammed by newbies or they just absorb the problem children as a part of doing business. None asked for me to FE, even though I had a tiny buyer history. Maybe because I pm&#039;ed each one first asking them about their product, world view, etc, they felt better about doing biz w me. These vendors you order from do have your address though, so I am surprised that someone would fuck with one of these guys.<br /><br />Hope your experience is as good as mine has been so far.&nbsp; One thing that you will learn by necessity here is PATIENCE.&nbsp; Not my forte, fo sho but maybe will help me in RL<br />&nbsp;:)
