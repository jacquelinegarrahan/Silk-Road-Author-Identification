				I simply don&#039;t get it. Is requiring FE against the rules or not? Do people not understand when they FE they are basically paying for someone&#039;s word?<br /><br />I mean I&#039;m not trying to call out one person right now, but it&#039;s just a shame that the some of the &#039;best&#039; vendors can do this and no one notices a pattern. You will get scammed!<br /><br />I don&#039;t care&nbsp; how good your shit is thurgoodjenkins I know damn well the SECOND I place my order you&#039;re taking my money and running up to the strawberry frosted hills of jebrolta<br />

				<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide<br /><br /><br />NOTICE: If you are a new vendor, you may not ask your customers to finalize their orders and release payment to you before you ship, a practice known as &quot;finalizing early&quot;. If you do this, you will lose your selling privileges. Once you have completed 35 successful transactions and have been a seller for at least one month, you may ask your customers to finalize early without repercussion. In no way do we support finalizing early in general and this rule should not be construed as support for finalizing early for more established vendors.

				Yes, but we tell everyone always to remain in escrow.&nbsp; On the other hand, we aren&#039;t here to babysit - everyone needs to take personal responsibility for their security here.&nbsp; People are capable of making informed decisions on their own and if they understand the risks and decide to finalize early against all recommendations to the contrary, then we wouldn&#039;t be able to stop that anyway.&nbsp; And probably wouldn&#039;t want to since this is a free market.

				Well to start with, yes indeed staying in escrow in a magnificent tool. <br />When I began buying stuff for SR I was a bit hesitant because the vendors I wanted to buy from required FE from new buyers.<br />I did anyway FE and just trusted their reputation with knowing my own risks.<br /><br />Now it is your choice when you are a new buyer and don&#039;t have yet the &quot;required&quot; stats to stay in escrow system and have to finalize. If you don&#039;t like this you can just look for a different vendor that don&#039;t requires FE. Fortunately the supply market is huge and you will surely find vendors that make business with newcomers.<br /><br />As for scamming. Yes it a possibility that a vendor can scam people easily but so easy is for the buyers. The only difference is that vendors have actually invested money in becoming vendors and they really rely on their stats and reputation. So I believe that they don&#039;t tend to scam the buyers even if they are new. On the other hand I find it super easy for a buyers to lie and say that their substances haven&#039;t arrived and demand a reship or refund. We are dealing with drugs, so all kind of people are here. Also notice that because vendors rely on their stats and reputation, some of them will try and avoid having unhappy customers. <br /><br />It all comes to personal choices in choosing the right vendor or choosing to trust the new buyer I guess. I will take though the side of the vendors because not only they invest and risk their money and freedom but also without them we would be able to talk right now.<br />I read somewhere here a similar thread where some vendor said that it would be nice to have rule that the newcomers have to FE. This statement is false as well cause it can easily help vendors in scamming.<br /><br />Finally, again is your choice to choose to finalize early. I did it 2 times in the beginning and fortunately all went good. If you don&#039;t like it, just choose a different vendor. Easy&nbsp; :D<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />Adamiz

				During my vendor &#039;trial&#039; we will say, I usually only had orders from members with heavy stats; &#039;testing me&#039; we shall say.... Now a few months later, I started to get a abnormally large amount of new account orders. I change my policy to FE for new accounts and they all disappeared. Not sure if I was targeted for scamming but ether-way, FE has its place. But not for top notch vendors or top notch customers.

The &lt;1% of transactions that screw up are usually scammers and it can only work one way, you have to trust vendors. If we trusted buyers to pay us without any guarantees we&#039;d just get ripped off and thing would fall apart. If you don&#039;t like FE&#039;ing then just find another vendor, there are plenty here who don&#039;t ask you to FE. It&#039;s all about risk in our eyes so if you work on weeding out scammers or know a better way then please share it with us because at the end of the day, it&#039;s our business.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />99% of transactions go smoothly? what about the 100&#039;s of people that have gotten scammed in the 1 month that i&#039;ve been here? IF you trusted buyers to pay you without any guarantees it WOULD STILL BE IN ESCROW. Escrow is the only thing that makes this site work. Keep fucking tracking numbers and you won&#039;t have a problem. It&#039;s bull shit that some of these vendors have 2+ accounts and just FE scam on one of them and then move on. <br /><br />I don&#039;t plan on FEing anytime soon, but the FE scamming will continue to happen. Just take a look around the road at how many different vendors require FE on certain items. Some of them put your order &quot;in transit&quot; seconds after you order just so you can finalize. Such bull shit that a site based on escrow has obvious loopholes that are getting people scammed and the admins just sit back and count their money, and maybe 2/3 weeks later they MIGHT ban the account. Buyers &quot;scamming&quot; vendors is nowhere near as big of a problem as vendors scamming buyers, and don&#039;t sit there and act like it is. Even if the buyer manages to scam an idiot vendor who doesn&#039;t have a tracking number, what do they get? A 50% refund? Vendors are clearly favored over buyers in almost ALL situations. They ALWAYS get the benefit of the doubt in a he said/she said battle just because of their vendor stats... which have proved to be nothing with the numerous 100 rating vendors scamming people.<br /><br />It&#039;s just a shame that such a great thing has such an easy way to scam people. Thurgood Jenkins said him self &quot;I had 36,000 in my hand the other day and 13,000 in my account, I could have just ran off, But I didn&#039;t because I could make this business much bigger&quot; (paraphrase) ... like are you serious????? I&#039;m not tryna call out Thurgoood cause he SEEMS like a good vendor, but don&#039;t they all?<br /><br /><br />@jackofspades Of course that&#039;s a possiblity, but that&#039;s when we can take the vendors/buyers stats into consideration and let the admins decide what to do with the situation. Is that not the reason we have the fucking escrow system??? The tracking WILL deter any buyer scammer from saying they never recieved their package though, which is how i&#039;m sure many have scammed vendors. If a vendor is a big enough scumbag to send a piece of paper with tracking through the mail then AT THE VERY LEAST their Vendor rating will go down. Which is better than nothing.

				Ok... Do you think everyone that gets scammed is a member of the forum? NO is the answer, probably less than half. Admins side with vendors (with good stats) way more than they do buyers. But once again this is the reason we have the fucking escrow system in place.

				The truth is, I don&#039;t care about people who get scammed after finalising early. If someone doesn&#039;t make the effort to research the seller or more broadly SR&#039;s ethos and history before they lay down some cash they can&#039;t afford to lose, I don&#039;t have any sympathy for them.

But you are wrong about the research aspect of your post. There was a 100 vendor that required FE for Cheap as fuck dank QPs and HPs and had amazing feedback, I was minutes away from ordering from him before I saw someone question him on the forums. That got me nervous enough not to order. But what other reasoning would I have NOT to order from the dude??? Great feedback, 100 rating what could go wrong right bro?<br /><br />The rule is stupid and anyone who supports it is obviously profiting off of it.

				Yeah, well hence why I added the bit about researching SR&#039;s ethos and history as well as just the seller. You only need to visit these forums for a moment before you come across a thread discussing the dangers of early finalisation.<br /><br />FE is the digital equivalent of giving your money to the street dealer who says he&#039;ll just go round the corner to get the goods. Wait here and I&#039;ll be right back my friend. FE is obviously a risky thing to do. It&#039;s just so obvious. And even if it isn&#039;t obvious to you, 5 mins on these forums is enough to tell you that it&#039;s risky. So if you choose to do it and you lose out, well better luck next time.

				Ok I agree, I&#039;m just saying that vendors should NEVER be allowed the option to force someone to FE for a certain listing. But the admins don&#039;t care so it&#039;s whatever. I don&#039;t plan on FEing any time soon, so I&#039;ll be fine.

I don&#039;t know of any. That would be horrible if any vendor could force someone to FE. SR would need to be burned down to the ground if that were possible. <br /><br />See what I did there? <br /><br />It&#039;s so simple; some vendors make FE for some listings or some buyer attributes a condition of purchase. If the buyer doesn&#039;t agree to the conditions, no one can force them to. There&#039;s no cyber gun being put to a buyer&#039;s head. The buyers who FE are literally choosing to do so. Sure there might be some inducement like a lower price or free shipping (or being the only vendor to offer something unique). But the option to FE is strictly the responsibility and choice of the buyer. <br /><br />If SR completely outlaws FE, it won&#039;t stop the practice of FE. Why? Those vendors that require it on condition of sale will just direct buyers offsite - probably something as simple as directing buyers to deposit coins into a wallet. And guess what? Those buyers will in all probability comply. <br /><br />Full disclosure: We have a policy for FE to weed out scammers. It&#039;s really just a limit. Newish buyers or people with bad stats, if their order is &gt;$500 then either they can buy less(and be covered under escrow) or FE. Their choice. Otherwise we won&#039;t honor their order and cancel it. If the buyer has bought from us before, then this doesn&#039;t apply. <br /><br />It&#039;s just like we provide a strong 4096bit PGP key. We don&#039;t *force* anyone to use it but for those who do, we provide them with a secure key to protect their data with. <br /><br />BTW, we have yet to ask anyone to FE or to buy less. Plus we use DCNs on all orders so we don&#039;&#039;t have to worry about the &quot;order never arrived&quot; scam. <br /><br /><br />

				Although i agree with you mostly about not FE and staying in escrow.<br />As others have said new buyers with lower stats can be an issue, and it&#039;s up to the vendor if they should decide to do business with them or not.<br />If its a problem for you there are plenty of others on the road waiting to fulfill your request.<br />For a buyer its pretty easy to tell by looking at the vendors feedback to see if he&#039;s legitimate or not. <br />So what is it exactly don&#039;t you &quot;get&quot; ? this topic has been talked about countless times, and pretty easy to understand. <br /><br />TLDR: Don&#039;t finalize early

				Yeah you guys were right. Allowing vendors to make FE only orders was a fantastic idea.<br /><br />Don&#039;t believe me just ask my man thurgood and planetexpress

				I used to be a big hater on the FE requirements, but I don&#039;t really care now honestly.<br /><br />If I am dealing with a vendor for the first time, I will order something small and relatively cheap regardless of what their feedback score is. This way, I can see if I would like to purchase from them in the future. If I get scammed, at least it won&#039;t be for a lot of btc and I will know to avoid them in the future.<br />If things go well, I may just FE in the future since I know it helps them out, and I wouldn&#039;t be buying large quantities anyway.<br /><br />FE or don&#039;t, there are a lot of vendors to choose from in the marketplace.

				Missed the edit, so here is a followup :<br /><br />Being that SR is what it is, I pretty much assume that at some point I will get ripped off. Another reason I don&#039;t buy much at a time. We are buying illegal things over the internet, bad shit is going to happen, and it is a testament to the community here that bad shit doesn&#039;t happen way more often.
