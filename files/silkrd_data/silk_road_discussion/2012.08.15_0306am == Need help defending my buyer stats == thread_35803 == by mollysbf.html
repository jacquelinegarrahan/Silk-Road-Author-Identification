				I have at least 12 orders. My first I got ripped by tony76 for $150 bucks and just recently to evilution for about $1000. Now after both those refunds....well tony I never got a refund because I FE&#039;d.....I have a refund rate of almost 25% even though I have spent about 280 bitcoins. I am having trouble getting a very reputable domestic vendor to send me a rather large order without FE when I know I and several vendors know I am a quick responding responsible buyer. <br /><br />I am just wanting to know if any vendors would be willing to vouch for me here? I don&#039;t want to name name&#039;s unless that&#039;s against the rules but I can post exactly who and what I bought on here if that&#039;s what people suggest, can&#039;t image that will be the response though lol

				I would say just ask someone or vendors to vouch for you or maybe ask an admin to do something to help your stats. Hope that helps.

				Yea I would pm an admin about your stats but as far as them refunding you I&#039;m not sure. I just read a post in another thread that they did refund someone who was scammed because the scammer had just been called out getting over on other buyers. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s all in the timing. It might be that the earlier you let them know about your situation getting scammed, the better they are at refunding you but that&#039;s all just my personal thought.

				I received a 100% refund on a 1000 dollar order from a vendor that was banned during the process. he scammed tons of people by giving 50% back but I fought to the end getting it all back through sr resolution but the refund rate is still appled to my buyer stats

				Well it&#039;s good to hear you got your money back. Like I said earlier having vendors and or if possible admins vouch for you would be ideal. Or you could try to work something out with the vendor you&#039;re trying to do business with. Like doing some smaller transactions first so that they build some trust with you. Lastly you could just wait and see if another vendor will pop up later down the road who sells what you are looking for that will also do business with you. That&#039;s what happened to me when I was new, didn&#039;t have any transactions and everyone wanted me to FE but I didn&#039;t want to. I waited a week and did another search for the product I wanted and several vendors popped up who were on vacation mode who didn&#039;t mind me not FE&#039;ing. Or even look for a newer vendor who is more willing to work with you because they are looking to build their stats up themselves.

				Yeah I just contacted SR about having my refund rate altered. I just can&#039;t FE after tony76 he had a (100) and so does this guy so I don&#039;t see why I should be more comfortable. I am just the kind of person that only buys bulk....sell to all my friends. I also contacted my last to vendors I used asking them to vouch for me. One sent a reply that didn&#039;t make much sense saying he would talk to his friend about it (meaning my vendor?) and the other hasn&#039;t replied but hopefully something good will come of this. The vendor not wanting me to FE is either not on forums or not very active or uses a different name or something.

				Oh....well keep posting in this thread and let me know how it goes. I want to know if the admin helps you or if the vendors vouch for you just in case I get into a situation similar to yours. Good luck with everything!

				I will try to keep this thread bumped because I really wish I could just name all the vendors I have used and wait for they to refute. I would hope SR would do something about this. If a vendor (Evilution) has at least two weeks of all no receives and all 50% refunds in all of his reviews and then his account gets suspended. We go to resolution and he offers me 50 and I reply with 100, then he replies with 75, then I stick to 100% bitcoin refund or a full reship. he gives me the coins. that if anything is proof that he never had the product because when selling methylone at that $hat price he would have made money still from a full reship. Bullshit. I make 2 different $1k transactions and ones perfect and of course the one from belgium is the one I get fucked with. $1k is a large refund rate with only 285 bitcoins spent

				You won&#039;t get help from admins at all. My refund rate is fucked because a few vendors refunded me 0 BTC&#039;s somehow, and it affected my rate. I pointed it out to admins, and they basically told me to get fucked. It is plainly clear that the refunds were not given to me, but they refuse to do anything about it. SR is down right now, but when it goes back up, I will post what I mean.
