				Poor guy, no-one deserves to get locked up for supporting our civil libertarian right to put what we want into our own bodies.<br /><br />Lets examine a few steps he could of taken to prevent this from happening, and that we can take to prevent this ever happening to us:<br /><br />1. If you are dealing, and not just buying off Silk Road for personal use, don&#039;t have drugs sent to your address! Pay other people to receive the packages or pay them to setup mailboxes if you have to, just don&#039;t have drugs sent to your place as that is what got the cops onto him in the first place.<br /><br />2. If you are dealing, DELETE YOUR TEXT MESSAGES AND SECURE YOUR PHONES. Have a text-only burner phone that you regularly change so your voice is never on it and get people to save it as a fake name, so you can always deny that it&#039;s yours. Because you change it regularly (Ideally every-time your credit runs out) this makes it much harder again for police to gather evidence on you. Ideally you should also never discuss specific drugs, prices, names or locations on this phone either. Also NEVER DISCUSS SILK ROAD ON THE PHONE EVER.<br /><br />3. Secure your computers with full-disk encryption and only access Silk Road through an amnesic means like Tails, Liberte or a VM running from a USB. Have a clearnet computer for general use obviously but never use it for suss Google searches and don&#039;t put anything suspicious on it.<br /><br />4. If you must possess suspicious items like a money counter and 35 stun guns, get a friend to hold onto them or store them away from your house. As for things like zip-lock bags and scales, create plausible deniability like having a couple of zip-lock bags full of lollies next to where you keep them and having the scales on-top of some Creatine or a gym supplement that needs to be weighed. As far as I know Shadh1 wasn&#039;t even caught with drugs at his house, it was just a bunch of corroborating evidence the police found in the raid that allowed them to charge him.<br /><br />If this guy had not followed step 1 but had followed all the other steps he would have been safe when he got raided and if he had just followed step 1 he never would have been raided in the first place! With some simple precautions what happened to him should NEVER happen to you.<br /><br />Stay safe guys, I really hope that no-one else gets caught like he did. Feel free to chime in with any other advice you have or mistakes that Shadh1 made, so we can learn from this experience!

Don&#039;t tell the people you use what&#039;s in the packages, or even tell them it&#039;s some kind of poisonous precursor chemical so they don&#039;t open it.<br />2. Make sure they don&#039;t tell you over your normal phone that the package is in. Just have them send you a tormail or a pre-determined coded text message (like &#039;Do you want to go see a movie this weekend?&#039;) to your burner phone.<br />3. Once the package is in have them write &#039;Return to sender&#039; and WAIT for 24 hours.<br />4. Have a runner pick up the packages for you after 24 hours, or have them dead-drop the package to you in the mailbox of a trusted accomplice or another pre-determined dead-drop location. Or have them mail it on to you domestically by placing the overseas envelope in a domestic express satchel. Or just use someone you trust 100% (Not always possible obviously).<br /><br />In the case of using other peoples PO boxes:<br />1. Have the person walk in and pay for a PO box in cash<br />2. Take the key off them so they can&#039;t use it<br />3. Have a bunch of mail with that persons name sent to the PO Box to legitimize it before sending drugs<br />4. Check it at night only and sporadically, or have a runner check it for you.<br />5. If the person contacts you at all about the PO box i&#039;d be suss that the police have contacted them. Make sure they know not to talk to you about it on the phone and deny if they do

				I disagree with step one. Leaves you way too vulnerable to theft, extortion, and just plan rating. Hell they might give you up if they get busted for something unrelated to make a deal out of their mess. <br /><br />If you do this step no one can know who you are.<br /><br />That means no friends, lovers, partners no one that can say who you are. <br /><br />Your OP is good and good information. Just don&#039;t rely on step one. I just don&#039;t trust people.<br /><br />There is risk with everything. Nothing will give you 100% protection. The person will have to decide which is the least risk for him/her.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some other ideas that are important are: <br />Never talk just deny and shut up. Never consent to searches of your person or property. <br /><br />Make their job hard and your lawyers job easy.<br /><br />Always be safe and go with what works for you. The more simple the better. If you make it too complicated you risk screwing something up or someone talking.

				And other people&#039;s habits affect us (i.e. teaching LE how to use Silk Road). So everyone who says they have had no problems with no encryption, deposit BTC directly into SR, or using fake names/addresses, etc., compromise the whole safety of SR. Be safe people. A little extra effort/cost makes things safer for us all.

				I would say from the case to avoid the same thing happening.<br />1) Don&#039;t get stuff sent to your house if you are ordering from Overseas trafficable amounts are not that much.<br />2) Don&#039;t get stuff sent to your real name, forget about mail fraud thats nothing compared to a jail term.<br />3) Don&#039;t order from &#039;red flagged&#039; countries and if you get a non arrival burn the address even if you think you were scammed fuck it off.<br />4) Don&#039;t talk to anyone about it and don&#039;t use your phone to sell if you are going to do that.<br />5) Do order as many stun guns as you want to your home address and using your real as its only a $1000 fine (like that makes sense) but anyway you can only harm someone with one of those as opposed to spreading the love with drugs but hey I don&#039;t make the laws here

				35 stun guns. Not personal consumption. Intent to resell. Maybe to some SM swingers clubs. Can&#039;t have that apparently. Is SM using electric shock help illegal there ? Not a very libertarian country.
