Mt Gox AND Bitinstant are both working with the DEA/.FBI now and they even have disclaimers about it. Be smart, I would personally use www.cryptoxchange.com but you can also get a program called Armour which lets you make different wallets that can help you tumble your coins.<br /><br />look up blockchain.info then in the search bar type any of your BTC addresses to see their complete history AND ALWAYS USE TOR WITH BTC!

				I was a bit worried yesterday too, so made a small &lt; 1BTC test deposit. Worked seamlessly. So then followed up with a large multi hundred coins deposit and it went in perfectly as well. This was after DPR posted that all deposits and withdrawals have been fixed.<br /><br />So no problems and 2 thumbs up.

				if it just worked i wouldnt think you should have an issue. hopefully it will arrive soon, some have just been taking a little while<br /><br />mine 12 hrs ago took longer than usual but worked fine. i held off from depositing on the 9th because i was worried of issues actually<br /><br />what happens sometimes when people use very old addresses is that the deposit doesnt get credited properly, so they have to contact SR support with details regarding the transfer and they manually add the coins to the acct. old addresses should work but generally when you see issues about deposits on the forum it is people using old addys

				yes, i recommend using a new address for every deposit. this is what i do and i have never had any issue with one<br /><br />DB if you have not received a confirmation email from BI then the SR end is not likely the issue. you made sure to deposit the exact correct amount? if you havent gotten the BI email then I would contact them to make sure they received the deposit or something didnt happen on their end
