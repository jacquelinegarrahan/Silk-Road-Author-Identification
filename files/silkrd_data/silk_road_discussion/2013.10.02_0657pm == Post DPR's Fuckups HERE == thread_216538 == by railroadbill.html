				Holy fuck he left more breadcrumbs than hansel fucking gretel, ill compile a list.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. Posted Gmail address containing his real name using same forum account handle used to advertise for SR when it started.<br />2. Logged into the VPN used to access SR and his gmail address from the same IP. I repeat, he did NOT use Tor to administer SR.<br />3. Use same public wifi to access internet 500ft from his house.<br />4. Disclosed that his timezone was PST in a message.<br />5. Wrote in his linkden profile that he had left his field to focus on &quot;creating an economic stimulation designed to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without systemic use of force by institutions and government&quot;.<br />6. Ordered fake ID&#039;s internationally to his home address (to setup more SR servers). The fake id&#039;s contained his picture, which considering what they were to be used for doesnt make any sense.<br />7. Told the DHS when they showed up at his door for the fake IDs that &quot;anyone can go onto SILK ROAD and order fake ids&quot;.<br />8. Solicited the hitman &quot;redandwhite&quot; for fake ID&#039;s using his DPR account. Hitman obviously FED/RAT.<br />9. Asked on clearnet helpsite Stackoverflow for help with programming for a hidden service. <br />10. Changed his real name to a pseudonym a minute before asking.<br />11. Used code that he posted on Stackoverflow in SR&#039;s code.<br />12. Increased ire of LEO by doing a Forbes interview. Revealed too much about his character.<br />13.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lets follow this up with a list of things that DPR did that didnt lead to his arrest:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1.

				Not sure if I read it right, but I think one site mentioned using coffee shops to access sr, which also contributed to it. Don&#039;t quote me on that one though.<br />I honestly thought he would have been smarter than that, and not stayed in the US full stop... :-\<br />~D

				All this time we thought DPR was a lot smarter. <br /><br />I can&#039;t understand why he would be operating SR from inside the US??? He could of been sat in russia or cuba or somehwere and would of been hard to get at. <br /><br />His biggest fuck up was storing all the data that he did. He stored information on each sales transaction. All SR messages. None of it needed to be kept. Holy fuck, they must have a lot on him and on sellers/buyers if they got the servers! <br /><br /><br />With the way he got caught and the mistakes that were made, it&#039;s fairly clear that there is no sophisticated back up plan about to swing into effect. <br /><br /><br />Let this be a lesson to everyone to keep your shit tight.

				so whats the deal? is there any way the vendors will get busted over this? I dont see how or why DPR would have stored our private messages or info. obviously the FEDS have control over this forum too. anyway they can use any of this info to grab us up?&nbsp; <br />Also, I never recieved my last 2 orders, maybe they were somehow seized? messaged read?

Nope, he was just a tool that the feds ALLOWED to operate so they could ass rape him and possibly others. <br /><br />The good news is that someone out there has to have the technical skills to run an SR clone without compromising common sense. If tor and btc are no longer secure, new protocols and payment methods need to be researched. <br /><br />Come on kids of the 80s-90s, wake the fuck up! Those of us (you know who you are) that have the skills need to get off our comfortable asses and get to work. The spirit of the early internet needs to be rekindled, along with the talent in the cryptography and privacy communities. The groundwork many of us have laid down has been broken. It&#039;s time to stop being complacent and get back to work!

				&nbsp; Alright, while I am seriously not happy about the situation, I think he is/was a standup guy.<br />He shouldn&#039;t have been so sloppy, yes, he should have been out of the country(that vacation? I bet thats how they ID&#039;d him, when the site went down for a week in april)&nbsp; Shit, I can think of 100 other places than San Fransisco.&nbsp; I honestly had him pegged as living in Goa or the Bahamas, even South America.&nbsp; If he&#039;d been in the Barrio in Mexico City, he would have been safer.&nbsp; Lets hope someone helps him escape prison, like in the movie SWAT, where the french guy puts a $100m contract on whoever can get them out, and mad gangs and shit bust him out.&nbsp; I personally think the site is in &quot;cold storage&quot;, that the feds don&#039;t have shit, and that the site will be up from another country, with all the coin on it, in a month or two.&nbsp; DPR wasn&#039;t essential to the operation before, and he sure as hell ain&#039;t now.
