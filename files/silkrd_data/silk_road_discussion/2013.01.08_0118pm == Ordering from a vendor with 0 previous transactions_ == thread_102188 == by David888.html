				Hi, I want to buy a certain product in Aus and have it shipped domestically (not willing to risk international)<br /><br />There is only one vendor for this product domestically and is new 10days or so with 0 previous transactions<br /><br />I won&#039;t finalise early and not really worried about being ripped off but more worried about LE issues such as if they could have set up an account<br /><br />Only 5 transactions myself so reasonably new here, any feedback on this like its too risky? Thanks.

				Definately don&#039;t FE, <br />Get sent to an address that&#039;s not your own, but ask the person if they can take a parcel for you, so they know not to open it.<br />wait a few days and watch for anyone spying in cars or vans..<br /><br />alternatively build a small box with a letter opening and hang it on the letterbox of an empty house (on holiday, vacant, etc)<br />watch for post, check the box at night for your package and run back home trying to sniff the entire contents.

				Who is this vendor? Do this vendor have a thread on the forums? Have you chatted with this vendor through mail to check if the vendor seems legit?

				I just did this recently and ended up hitting a home run.&nbsp; Ordered from a brand new vendor zero transactions and got some really good shit within a few days&nbsp; Obviously do not FE.&nbsp; I&#039;d shoot the vendor a few messages back and forth to get a feel for them and then make a decision weighing risk/reward.

Just to piggy back off powr, you have to use your best judgement. Try not to spend too much money on the first order with him/her, keep the coins in escrow and remain chill. Give this vendor sometime before jumping to conclusions. Remember, he/she is a newbie and will probably make some mistakes.<br /><br />I just ordered from someone this past Thursday. This vendor only had 5 reviews and I took a chance. Just as I suspected he screwed up the order lol. The thing is he has remained in contact with me the whole time. So sometimes to get what you want you have to take a chance.

				I&#039;ve talked to him on messaging and seems legit but I guess that doesn&#039;t count for much. As i said before i wouldn&#039;t finalise early and my concerns are with LE. Think I will just leave it and maybe within a few weeks he will have 20 transactions or so already

				some vendor had to trust you as a new buyer with 0 purchases at some point, right? and there&#039;s more security in buying than there is in vending, as far as I can tell. someone&#039;s gotta be first, y&#039;know.

				Well you can&#039;t get mugged off because you can&#039;t FE for new vendors anyway so fuck it. Even if there is an issue it&#039;s not unfixable.

I could go on forever, but it&#039;s my vagina talking. ;)

				I think you guys have gotten a little too complacent if you write off that possibility as vaginal discharge. Then again I&#039;m bleeding like a stuck pig at the moment
