				I mean honestly, they have had access to the servers for the last THREE MONTHS. They have all the unencrypted addresses they want and more and more coming in every day. They were setting up something much larger. Guaranteed they&#039;ve known where Ulbricht lives for a while now. Could&#039;ve arrested him long ago but why didn&#039;t they? I believe they were turning this into a honeypot. It was a work in progress until what!? GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. I mean christ sake people, look at the FBI website. It says they don&#039;t even have someone to update their website. I would bet almost anything that this, along with MANY other cases were to be closed and prosecuted ASAP. They&#039;ve had his conspiracy chargers whenever they wanted and that murder for hire happened several months ago. They wanted more and because they lost their funding for this project, they took what they could get and got the biggest player. A win for them but not their intended endgame from the start. <br />As for going forward, they HAVE ALL OF OUR INFORMATION. If they decide to start going again, they&#039;ll go with the next biggest players, the large scale US vendors. If they can figure anything out about them, they&#039;ll be next. After that, high volume buyers. I think (and hope) that small personal buys aren&#039;t worth their time. It may not even be worth their time for the stuff I mentioned above. They have DPR and like I said, that&#039;s good enough of a win for them.<br /><br />So yes, we are lucky that this major defunding happened sooner than later.

They haven&#039;t had actual access to the server for that long--just a disk image created by a foreign government. They gained access upon arresting DPR the other day. <br /><br />Your assertion that &quot;they HAVE ALL OF OUR INFORMATION&quot; is not correct--it seems to be an irrational assumption rooted in fear. Those of us using Tor and GPG have nothing to worry about. If they had ways of cracking GPG messages or tracing us back through Tor, large vendors would already be gone--especially those who order vending supplies from other vendors with their vendor accounts. Instead, they had to interrogate one guy that they caught because they were unable to find the other vendors who had been ordering from him. They only caught this guy because he was placing orders without using GPG, which, honestly, is really fucking stupid and is something people do out of pure laziness and a false sense of security.<br /><br />While it is definitely a smart idea never to underestimate the government, spreading fear about what the government has on us or can do does not help us. It advances the causes of tyranny and oppression through the force of superstition, and that gives them more power.<br /><br />Using tools like GPG and Tor, we could conduct business like this all day long without anybody getting caught--even if the government ran the place. The only exception to this is that escrow wouldn&#039;t work very well, as dispute resolution requires vendors to provide tracking information, which wouldn&#039;t be safe. We are not in any way &quot;lucky&quot; that this happened. Hopefully some people wake up and start using GPG and being more secure about how they purchase and transfer bitcoins, and maybe some good will come of that. In the end, however, this is a setback that, as with the rest of the war on drugs, has served to do nothing but ruin innocent lives.

				First things first, to the person who said they don&#039;t have our encrypted information, YES they do. Just because they allegedley &quot;can&#039;t&quot; unencrpyt it doesn&#039;t change the fact that if they spent enough time and money, it is not impossible.<br /><br />Now to the quote below:<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just not the case at all.<br />1.

Well I have and if the military is aything like LEA, which it IS,&nbsp; your first point is totally moot. Yes, unfuding the government applies to MOST federal agencies. The FBI and DEA is included. The defense budget is ALWAYS kept. This is to ensure that foreign affairs are kept moving as planned and servicemen and women are still paid. After that, things not pertaining to NATIONAL SECURITY are always secondary. Silk Road has no terrorist threat to America therefore would have no reason to keep going if other cases were deemed more important on a tightened budget. This was a relatively cheap case to conduct according to whom, you? I guess no one told you how much money operations cost. I&#039;m not going to cite information, but go ahead and google how much FBI agents get paid, how many are involved in a HUGE case like this and how much operations cost. Then come back and tell me it&#039;s cheap to run. The report says 3 agents were involved. You think 3 flew across the country and ran the manhunt on Ulbricht? No, they communicated with other offices in different states. Let&#039;s see, without going into too much detail, we know there is a federal case against him and also Maryland is charging him. Relatively cheap is such an ubstantiated comment.<br /><br />What you said about them not wasting their time finding people because so many people used encryption is so stupid. Look at all the people worried about being caught because they DIDN&#039;T use GPG. It would make NO SENSE for them to start catching people left and right at first, obviously that would set a huge red flag off with all the rest of us and make us realize the server was compromised. The whole point of an investigation is to gather information as long as they can to get as many suspects that they could. If my assumptions are correct, they already knew Ulbricht&#039;s identity. Their next plan of action was to go after large scale vendors. I don&#039;t know how you could disagree. Eventually, all criminals mess up. Look at &quot;Nod&quot;. How long did he get away before he finally messed up? I don&#039;t know but they were waiting for him to. So that doesn&#039;t eve make sense that you&#039;d say this wouldn&#039;t become a honeypot because yes, it would. Just because something is encrypted doesn&#039;t mean and it can&#039;t be decrypted. GPG would be nearly impossible but we don&#039;t know what sort of encryption was done on the website alone. Enough time and manpower could theortetically crack the code. So I&#039;m sorry, but your disagreement with me makes no sense. <br /><br />I started writing the first half like an hour ago and finshed later so if it doesn&#039;t make sense in some parts I apologize or if there is something I missed that you disagree with let me know again. Thanks.

They have all the unencrypted addresses they want and more and more coming in every day. They were setting up something much larger. Guaranteed they&#039;ve known where Ulbricht lives for a while now. Could&#039;ve arrested him long ago but why didn&#039;t they? I believe they were turning this into a honeypot. It was a work in progress until what!? GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. I mean christ sake people, look at the FBI website. It says they don&#039;t even have someone to update their website. I would bet almost anything that this, along with MANY other cases were to be closed and prosecuted ASAP. They&#039;ve had his conspiracy chargers whenever they wanted and that murder for hire happened several months ago. They wanted more and because they lost their funding for this project, they took what they could get and got the biggest player. A win for them but not their intended endgame from the start. <br />As for going forward, they HAVE ALL OF OUR INFORMATION. If they decide to start going again, they&#039;ll go with the next biggest players, the large scale US vendors. If they can figure anything out about them, they&#039;ll be next. After that, high volume buyers. I think (and hope) that small personal buys aren&#039;t worth their time. It may not even be worth their time for the stuff I mentioned above. They have DPR and like I said, that&#039;s good enough of a win for them.<br /><br />So yes, we are lucky that this major defunding happened sooner than later.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re only partially correct. They haven&#039;t had actual access to the server for that long--just a disk image created by a foreign government. They gained access upon arresting DPR the other day. <br /><br />Your assertion that &quot;they HAVE ALL OF OUR INFORMATION&quot; is not correct--it seems to be an irrational assumption rooted in fear. Those of us using Tor and GPG have nothing to worry about. If they had ways of cracking GPG messages or tracing us back through Tor, large vendors would already be gone--especially those who order vending supplies from other vendors with their vendor accounts. Instead, they had to interrogate one guy that they caught because they were unable to find the other vendors who had been ordering from him. They only caught this guy because he was placing orders without using GPG, which, honestly, is really fucking stupid and is something people do out of pure laziness and a false sense of security.<br /><br />While it is definitely a smart idea never to underestimate the government, spreading fear about what the government has on us or can do does not help us. It advances the causes of tyranny and oppression through the force of superstition, and that gives them more power.<br /><br />Using tools like GPG and Tor, we could conduct business like this all day long without anybody getting caught--even if the government ran the place. The only exception to this is that escrow wouldn&#039;t work very well, as dispute resolution requires vendors to provide tracking information, which wouldn&#039;t be safe. We are not in any way &quot;lucky&quot; that this happened. Hopefully some people wake up and start using GPG and being more secure about how they purchase and transfer bitcoins, and maybe some good will come of that. In the end, however, this is a setback that, as with the rest of the war on drugs, has served to do nothing but ruin innocent lives.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>astor how nice of you to join us again, even under the assumed new name. glad you&#039;re OK

Just because they allegedley &quot;can&#039;t&quot; unencrpyt it doesn&#039;t change the fact that if they spent enough time and money, it is not impossible.<br /><br />Now to the quote below:<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Just not the case at all.<br />1. The shutdown doesn&#039;t effect FBI/DEA Funding related to case work, and this was a relatively cheap case to work.<br /><br />2. LE doesn&#039;t operate like that in terms of the honeypot, in this case all the serious players aren&#039;t get able due to using the proper encryption protocols. Several vendors have been busted over the last 18 months and there was not any huge flow down on any on them, nor was there a flow down in Australia where a huge ring was taken down that run its business down ward through tor systems, that case will be coming to trial in the coming months. They simply pinched the guys on the same level that worked outside of internet to supply and distribute to the sellers or leaders of sales teams.<br /><br />3. US is shifting its focus in the war on drugs, and&nbsp; non violent high quality vendors simply don&#039;t fit the mandate, they will take anything that falls into their lap eg a large buyer who didn&#039;t use proper protocol, but they won&#039;t run an operation where they can&#039;t foresee the benefit, as a honey pot on a site where users are instructed to use certain measures that prevent LE from ever knowing their identity.<br /><br />4. The timing is usually one of a few things,:<br />a) a previously set dead line for the case.<br />b) search for DPRs money, remember the 500,000 bitcoin account disappeared some time ago.<br />c) It is standard after you have a guy to wait a few months and see what happens, it is a standard part of the case end game.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;ve clearly never worked for the US government. Well I have and if the military is aything like LEA, which it IS,&nbsp; your first point is totally moot. Yes, unfuding the government applies to MOST federal agencies. The FBI and DEA is included. The defense budget is ALWAYS kept. This is to ensure that foreign affairs are kept moving as planned and servicemen and women are still paid. After that, things not pertaining to NATIONAL SECURITY are always secondary. Silk Road has no terrorist threat to America therefore would have no reason to keep going if other cases were deemed more important on a tightened budget. This was a relatively cheap case to conduct according to whom, you? I guess no one told you how much money operations cost. I&#039;m not going to cite information, but go ahead and google how much FBI agents get paid, how many are involved in a HUGE case like this and how much operations cost. Then come back and tell me it&#039;s cheap to run. The report says 3 agents were involved. You think 3 flew across the country and ran the manhunt on Ulbricht? No, they communicated with other offices in different states. Let&#039;s see, without going into too much detail, we know there is a federal case against him and also Maryland is charging him. Relatively cheap is such an ubstantiated comment.<br /><br />What you said about them not wasting their time finding people because so many people used encryption is so stupid. Look at all the people worried about being caught because they DIDN&#039;T use GPG. It would make NO SENSE for them to start catching people left and right at first, obviously that would set a huge red flag off with all the rest of us and make us realize the server was compromised. The whole point of an investigation is to gather information as long as they can to get as many suspects that they could. If my assumptions are correct, they already knew Ulbricht&#039;s identity. Their next plan of action was to go after large scale vendors. I don&#039;t know how you could disagree. Eventually, all criminals mess up. Look at &quot;Nod&quot;. How long did he get away before he finally messed up? I don&#039;t know but they were waiting for him to. So that doesn&#039;t eve make sense that you&#039;d say this wouldn&#039;t become a honeypot because yes, it would. Just because something is encrypted doesn&#039;t mean and it can&#039;t be decrypted. GPG would be nearly impossible but we don&#039;t know what sort of encryption was done on the website alone. Enough time and manpower could theortetically crack the code. So I&#039;m sorry, but your disagreement with me makes no sense. <br /><br />I started writing the first half like an hour ago and finshed later so if it doesn&#039;t make sense in some parts I apologize or if there is something I missed that you disagree with let me know again. Thanks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>kmkfw, nice of you to join us also. very fortuitous you left at that time...

When you login, your password doesn&#039;t get stored anywhere: the server hashes it, check the hash against the hash in the database and providers the user with a sessionID in a cookie. (simplified that&#039;s what it comes down to) Besides a sessionID, it&#039;s possible to to use another non-reversible hash of the password to encrypt the messages/addresses and give this non-reversible hash in a cookie to the user upon logging in as well.<br /><br />Possible downside is that you won&#039;t be able to change your password without your old password. (but this wasn&#039;t possible on SR IIRC anyway) Your password could be bruteforced, but if you used a proper password, you would be safe.

				My opinion on this is they were looking bad that Silk Road was running along nicely all this time making them look like they didn&#039;t care or put enough effort into putting a halt to it to please the church going anti drug folk and once the Forbes interview went public combined with the road becoming more known about by everyone they had to be seen to catch the owner/creator after their nose was rubbed into the shit!<br /><br />I think what they&#039;ve done is enough to feed to the public to keep them happy for a while and I&#039;m sure or hoping that the small fish are too much effort to use resources on. Maybe one or two big sellers will be in their sites as a bonus back slap!<br /><br />Who knows!

Lol<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is a true story! (makes me look like a bullshit story teller saying that but anyway, here it goes...)<br /><br />A friend of mine told me ;-) ;-) that he ordered 3 grams of MDA (a dodgy half price appealing sale) to a friends house because he couldn&#039;t use his own due to receiving a &quot;love letter&quot;. The friends mate was cool about it and so the order went through. Nothing arrived after a couple of weeks and there seemed to be a mix between happy and unhappy customers on the sellers forum thread combined with bad and good feedback with claims of selective scamming by the seller who hardly responded to the allegations. The friend took the hit of the loss on the half price 3 grams and didn&#039;t mind because he knew it was a risk from the start with the FE catch of the sale!<br /><br />About a month or more later, my friends friend got a message from a family member to say the local police wanted a word in his ear about something but that it wasn&#039;t anything to worry about! The friends mate decided to go to the local police station to see what it was all about at the advice of others not to because he didn&#039;t have to.<br /><br />He didn&#039;t sleep the night before meeting the police and had made up a story to tell them if they had known about the 3 grams that should have arrived to his house if that&#039;s what they wanted to meet him about.<br /><br />They asked him about drugs being sent to his house because interpol had been in touch with the local police with a list of names and addresses that were to receive drugs through the post they must have intercepted!<br /><br />Instead of playing dumb and denying knowing anything about it, the guy made up a story that he tried a drug at a party, liked it and so ordered it on the internet to try it again! No mention of Silk Road. He just said the internet.<br /><br />Turns out that the address was wrong on the list and was the address of a house a few doors away so basically, this guy admitted to something he didn&#039;t even really do and had he said nothing, he would have been all clear! Nothing came of it but what I&#039;m trying to get across is, say nothing and admit to nothing and if asked, NEVER make a statement!!!<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />Drunken coked up fiend!<br /><br />P.S. Hope the story makes sense to y&#039;all!!!

The paranoia is increasing with every passing day!<br /><br />I understand why the vendors are sweating, but the small buyers freaking out I just don&#039;t get.<br /><br />Before you read this paragraph, I want to make clear that there&#039;s a huge BUT at the end:<br />But if you want to get technical, if they&#039;re able to view individual accounts, they can see your transaction history for at least a month. That information is stored in your account (I&#039;m not sure how long, but I had a month&#039;s worth last time I looked). So yeah, while the drugs are gone, they can see what you bought, how much you paid, the date,&nbsp; and the vendor you bought them from. You&#039;re in the UK, so I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the same, but in the US, they could charge you based on the paper trail, whether you still have the drugs or not (and that&#039;s assuming that you don&#039;t have any drugs in your possession that you&#039;ve just bought by the time they come knocking -- how would they know if they&#039;re the same drugs or not?).<br /><br />BUT, with that said, why on fucking earth would anyone think they&#039;re going to take the time to review every, single fucking SR account? There&#039;s got to be millions of them, especially since many people have had more than one account. How is that worth the time and the effort? Talk about mundane. <br /><br />

The problem is that those of us who use drugs tend to buy more when we run out. So yeah, you blew through your SR stash, but you&#039;re never going to re-up? And you&#039;re never, ever going to store drugs in your house again? <br /><br />Since you&#039;ve got no idea when they&#039;d be coming, how can you be prepared (like how do you know how long you&#039;ve got to wait before bringing drugs into your house again?). The statute of limitations for the US federal government for drug possession is 5 years (just using the US as an example). That&#039;s a long fucking time of careful living, especially for people who love to get high (like me).<br /><br />But yeah, they&#039;re not going to bother busting you because you bought an 8 ball or 2 (or 10) or a QP of weed on SR. I just wanted to point out that many of us are careless when we feel secure (I know I&#039;m a lazy fucking bastard at least&nbsp; :D). Five years is a long time to stay vigilant!

I&#039;m not up on the history of it all as you and just thought in my drunken coked up state that although SR was known about, my opinion was that the Forbes interview hit a wider scale of people and even though they already had their case together that that interview pushed them to go in for the kill!<br /><br />Why didn&#039;t they go for it earlier before that interview if they already had built their case?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				&quot;let me tell you all this. cause it might make you realize how you&#039;re all worrying about nothing. i&#039;ve never used pgp for my address when ordering. and i&#039;m not worried in the slightest. you know why? ..because all the drugs i ever ordered have arrived and have now been done. the last lot arrived to day and i&#039;ve been high as fuck on them, but they are now gone. so the feds can come round here all they like, but without the actual physical drugs they have absolutely nothing on me. anyone could have sent an order to a sr seller using my address, that doesn&#039;t prove fuck all against me unless LE catch me with the drugs themselves. the feds have missed their window of opportunity as far as me is concerned.<br /><br />so fuck you feds, you fuckmother cunts. better luck next time lol&quot;<br /><br />This is a really dumb attitude to have. If LE have enough info from the site about you (ie your name and address) and are able to link your forum username to the site account, they have all your orders, and you here admitting to - no, bragging - about placing multiple orders of narcotics and using. A seized stash helps, but if the perp&#039;s stupid enough or if there&#039;s a confession (which the above is) they don&#039;t need one. Just like you can be convicted for murder even through there&#039;s no body. <br /><br />Gotta say, you&#039;re being really imprudent. If LE decided to charge you, you&#039;d have the book thrown at you if you went to trial after the judge reads the above. For real.<br /><br />Of course, you&#039;re probably right in that LE almost certainly won&#039;t bother you if you&#039;re a smalltime buyer. Still, the bravado and defiance is ill-informed. You&#039;ve been compromised by the cops. They have your details. You&#039;re on a list somewhere. So stop acting like a smarmy dick. Like you&#039;re oh-so-clever you got away with it. You haven&#039;t got away with shit. No, you&#039;re just too insignificant to bother with. If they wanted to they could hang you by the balls, particularly in regards to what you&#039;ve written above. So have a bit of humility, learn a lesson, be thankful that you&#039;re most probably not going to have the coppers darken your doorstep because you&#039;re a small fish, and cover your ass better next time.

				PS and the other thing is you don&#039;t know LE&#039;s brief. They always say shit like &quot;it doesn&#039;t matter how big or small you are...if you&#039;re involved with illegal drugs, we&#039;re going to get you blahblah&quot; ... well every now and again they actually pay lip service to taking care of a few of the small people involved with illegal drugs. In this case, they might have been told to prosecute a handful of smalltime SR buyers so that no one feels safe. <br /><br />You know, if I was the agent who had to fill their quota of 5 smalltime SR buyers to prosecute, I&#039;d look at itsallmememe&#039;s post, check his ordering history, see his confession on the forum, see that he&#039;d just called me a motherfucker cunt and clearly thinks he&#039;s much much much smarter than I am...and think to myself &quot;hmm this is not only a slam dunk case, but it&#039;s also a bust that I&#039;m really going to enjoy making. Let&#039;s see how this asshole feels when a few &#039;motherfucker cunts&#039; come knocking. Imagine how shocked he&#039;d be when we don&#039;t even try to search his place for narcotics while he&#039;s being cuffed&quot;

				Thank you, CodoneCowboy, laplace and bouclelan for clearing up the misconceptions.

But assuming your theory about DPR being flagrant and that having an influence on him being arrested, there were much more blatant actions taken by DPR publicly. He was on both Twitter and Facebook, and he established the clearnet sit (which I&#039;d never heard of until after the bust) silkroadlink dot com (well, that&#039;s according to what Greenberg says in Forbes in the artillery he wrote AFTER DPR&#039;s arrest).<br /><br />As for the timing, their case wasn&#039;t &quot;entirely built.&quot; They don&#039;t move in on you if&nbsp; you, one, are not aware of the evidence they have against you and, two, are not aware that you&#039;re going to be arrested. They wait until either they&#039;ve got enough definitive evidence to secure a conviction--or at least a plea bargain (based on their past experiences)--or they&#039;ve got the impression that you&#039;re about to flee. If anything, the Forbes interview gave them confidence that DPR was unaware that they were close to arresting him. That gave them more time to continue gathering evidence.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
