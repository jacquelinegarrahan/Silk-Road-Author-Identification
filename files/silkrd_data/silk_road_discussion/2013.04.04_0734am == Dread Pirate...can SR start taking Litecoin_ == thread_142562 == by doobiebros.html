				I could see this as being beneficial to BTCs pr, as SR would no longer be as much of a reason for the government to try and take out BTC. It would also probably help establish LTC as a legit currency. I like this idea.

I&#039;ve never been fond of alternatives to anything unless it&#039;s actually better. I agree on the advantage of them being easier to mine right now -- bitcoins have exploded more times these last 30 days than soft yet firm things have been exploded inside Jenna Jameson&#039;s willing and waiting mouth. It&#039;s ridiculous. (So are her movies.) Some Silk Roaders don&#039;t just buy bitcoins ENTIRELY for drugs you know. Hedging means nothing on these occasions, doesn&#039;t make a difference at all on non-merchandise transactions. At time of writing 1 BTC is 123.00 USD but 1 LTC is 4.09 USD. Big bloody difference!! :o Course it would be great for mining............. assuming litecoins follow the path of botcoins which I can almost guarantee they will not. And there;s the problem. We would have to stuff things around to find out they wil not take off as much, how can they, bitcoin has taken that momentum and no one is going to suddenly get on board with litecoins commercially in the same way, you know it is not even possible. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142562.msg975881#msg975881">Quote from: maple on April 04, 2013, 03:24 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I could see this as being beneficial to BTCs pr, as SR would no longer be as much of a reason for the government to try and take out BTC. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Probably wouldn&#039;t be as much of a reason, but I can assure you they will try and do it anyway as it is not able to be manipulated the way the Reserve Bank has manipulated regular currencies since day 1 (early 20th century from memory). Look at what has happened in UK recently with blockchain. I&#039;m going to bow out of placing the blame on government for this, I am not that silly. If I don&#039;t know, I will admit. I admit it. I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know what happened to blockchain in UK (still up for other countries, I was looking at it last night). But I&#039;ve seen the conspiracy theories on the net -- &quot;the only people who buy BTC are shady drug barons and assassins and dark people who only want to spend it on terrorism, hit contracts and Silk Road, a vast underground narcotics empire of unimaginable power and subterfuge, etc, etc,&quot; please shut up these people, you know how far the media run with this ball. I don&#039;t think a federal government, at least in the global north, can shut it down in a very definite high profile way but banks asking Fallkniven why he wants to purchase bitcoins for is the type of thing that just pisses me off and makes it a hassle to obtain them in the first place. (I can understand the logic of keeping BTC transactions fully in house via use of a Silk Road BTC vendor as a buffer from this kind of subtle harassment and a paper trail, I really do.)<br /><br />Shit, did this go off topic at any time?<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I&#039;ve been looking at LTC as well, but mainly as an alternative investment (to spread the risks on e-currencies and not have all on BTC&#039;s). <br /><br />But regarding the use on SR, since you can buy parts of BTC&#039;s I don&#039;t really see the use. <br />OK, if you had to buy BTC&#039;s per unit then I would understand that people who want to have an order of 10$ or so wouldn&#039;t be too happy to be obligated to invest 100$ or more. But if you want to buy for less than the worth of 1 BTC, just buy a piece of a BTC... <br /><br />So yes, for the investment I understand the demand (also because people who invest now in LTC would probably see the LTC value go up quite quickly if it were usable on SR) - but I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s a real need for a second currency on SR. <br />It would indeed complicate all much more for DPR and his team.

				This whole bitcoin fiasco has got me thinking.&nbsp; Would using litecoin as well as bitcoin not be a good idea in spreading the vulnerability of these virtual currencies?<br /><br />If we didn&#039;t depend on just the one currency we could maybe get round all the problems that come about if MT Gox gets attacked etc.&nbsp; Ideally SR could eventually accept a number of virtual currencies.&nbsp; This would strengthen SR and crypto currencies in general.

				Adding litecoin would be a positive move. The Atlantis market uses both litecoin and bitcoin.

				I think it would be positive just to have the option of both BTC and litecoin. Vendors choose what to accept. Specifically for times like this huge crash and people don&#039;t want to use BTC it would be trivial to just use litecoin.

It would be more work for vendors spent on paperwork and calculating it, than actually on packaging and order-filling. One of my mantras is never spend in insubordinate amount of time doing unnecessary work if you can help it, as it takes time away from real work. <br /><br />I guess if bitcoin rose so high or became unnaturally volatile it may be worth looking into. It would take a HELL of a lot of mucking around though, both setting it up, implementing it into the .SYS, and working with it side-by-side with good old bitcoin. You would want it to be worth it.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
