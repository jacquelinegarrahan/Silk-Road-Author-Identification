				I believe on SR the vendor chooses whether or not his listings are hedged. BMR on the other hand has absolutely no hedging or fluctuation protectiong.

				SIMPLY ..... when you make an order (and DONT FE)&nbsp; your $&#039;s stay &quot;in escrow&quot;<br />&nbsp;which means that they are &quot;held&quot;&nbsp; by&nbsp; TSR&nbsp; who only &#039;release&#039;&nbsp; those (your)&nbsp; &nbsp;$&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;only&nbsp; once you have&nbsp; &quot;approved&quot;&nbsp; the product by Finalizing<br /><br />By doing this,&nbsp; BOTH&nbsp; they vendor and buyer are placing their trust in the SR&#039;s&nbsp; system . . which clearly works Or we wouldn&#039;t be here!<br /><br />The &quot;amount&quot; you have paid for the product,&nbsp; &quot;once the order has been accepted and from &#039;processing&#039; on to delivery&quot; ...&nbsp; WILL STAY THE SAME ... the &#039;price&#039;&nbsp; will not change!&nbsp; <br /><br />IF&nbsp; you are &#039;worried&#039; about things like a vendor not &#039;hedging&#039; their orders .... ask them If they do?&nbsp; All good vendors will be happy to help/tell you<br /><br />IF&nbsp; the package doesn&#039;t show up . . . you can then request a &#039;Resolution&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; (which are fairly uncommon, esp compared to the &#039;successful&#039; deliveries)<br /><br /><br /><br />I hope this helped . . . Please everyone . .&nbsp; at least TRY and DO some Research . . . IF you ARE&nbsp; STILL&nbsp; having major problems . . . shoot motek a pm&nbsp; she&#039;ll see what she can do ; )

I do not have a learning disability myself (making it hard for me to see from someone with a learning disability&#039;s point of view), but a number of people very close to me are dyslexic so I do understand where you&#039;re coming from. The SR Wiki was not written with such people in mind, but instead was written to appeal to the understanding of the greater majority.<br /><br />Examples should of course always be provided, however in the excerpt I posted above, an example is provided:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For example, someone purchases one of your 10 btc listings.

I have not seen any &quot;cruel and pointless attacks on people in here&quot; simply because they cannot understand something that for many can often be confusing; I have, however, experienced members (including myself) becoming incredibly frustrated at answering the same questions that have been answered numerous times before in many threads and on the Wiki itself.<br /><br />People get frustrated not because others do not understand, but because others fail - for the most part - to actually read the information that is already available to them, just a few clicks away. I do not have any expectations of others here, except that they read and attempt to understand the information presented to them. If they continuously have problems doing so then I am always more than willing to help them out. However, if they are simply too lazy to click around or do a simple search, I have absolutely no time for them.<br /><br />I will attempt to view things from the perspective of others in future before responding to questions such as those put forth in the original post. It remains my opinion though, that the author of said post was simply not bothered to read through the Wiki, nor search the forums to find the information that they were looking for.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
