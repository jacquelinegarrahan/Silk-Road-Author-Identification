				I&#039;m sad to see you go.&nbsp; There is a certain comfort in having the old guard vendors going strong.&nbsp; You have been a great and bold early participant in this experiment, and I, for one, am sad to see you go.&nbsp; It&#039;s people like you who have made this place great. Thanks for stepping up and being one of the great vendors. I say this with all sincerity.&nbsp; I wish you luck in your future endeavors.

				I have never purchased shrooms from you but my friend has, and they were the BOMB! Makes me wish I did, and I would love to try them if you decide to give me the opportunity.<br /><br />Shame to see you go, you were one of the good ones.<br />You rocked the shrooms section man! My friend has been buying ounces off you for a few months now, hasn&#039;t ordered from a single other person since he got that first package from you.<br /><br />Anyways I hope you find something else you are passionate about, that is what is important.

				Oh man, was not prepared for this. I just did my first order with you recently and I should have been going to you all along, easily the best shrooms I&#039;ve ever eaten. I had a small mishap with PGP and I&#039;m very grateful that you were so accommodating and shipped my order out on a day that you normally take a break. Came way before I expected and gave me one hell of a night.<br /><br />This place will miss the hell out of you, I hope you find whatever you&#039;re looking for. Rest easy knowing that you&#039;ve provided me and countless others with not only a huge dose of euphoria but also the tools to become a better person.

				I&#039;m not going to ass kiss for some MDMA and shrooms, I&#039;m not saying I don&#039;t like MDMA or shrooms or that I wouldnt want your beautiful shrooms or your MDMA. (PLEASE GIVE IT TO ME). I&#039;m just not going to lie. <br />You were a honorable and one of our very respectable vendors. You are someone who has given the Silk Road a good name and shown this is not a place only for out of mind drugged up criminals. I can only thank you for the true service you has done us in more ways then just selling good product. Your overall buisness acumen was as good as it could get. We need people like you for new vendors to learn from.<br />A Sincere thank you,<br />Blud

				My first &quot;real&quot; SR order was from Rocker, back in the fall of 2011. Clicking the checkout button that day changed my life. First there was the anxiety, that &quot;what have I just done?&quot; feeling. There was going to be a box of drugs with my name on it headed through the postal system. It was insane. But then, a few days later, came all the nervous relief and magical giddiness when the package arrived, a small box like any other I&#039;d get from eBay, with a vacuum-packed quarter of shrooms tucked inside. I could hardly believe it. This was the real thing. The following weekend, I set aside some time to be alone, crushed up a little over an eighth, swallowed and began to wait. I didn&#039;t know what to expect. I&#039;m still not sure what it is I got. I was out on the back porch at one point, staring into the distance where all the leaves from all the trees in their various states of changing color overlapped one another, an unseasonably warm breeze lightly brushing my skin, the air almost silent except for a distant windchime, and I lost the sense that I knew the names or meanings of any of these things, or of myself, or that anything had ever existed besides that one eternal moment. It seemed like time slowed down, and I dissolved into the stillness. Of course, everything came back eventually. Well, almost: when I woke up the following morning, what had been a lifelong depression was gone. I don&#039;t know how to describe this without sounding like I&#039;m exaggerating, but this is the truth: it felt like I was really alive for the first time. I looked at the world with childlike eyes, enthralled at the potential of it all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made many more orders off SR in the months that followed, and I&#039;ve had similar experiences on other drugs, but none so strong or as profound as that one (most likely because it was the first, but I wouldn&#039;t be too quick to downplay the individual magic of Rocker&#039;s shrooms). I&#039;ve made some major life changes, and although there were definitely other factors involved, I view my experience on Rocker&#039;s shrooms as the first step, more or less. I don&#039;t post on here, as I consider it wise to remain as anonymous as possible with this kind of thing, but 2012 was the best year of my life, and Rocker and SR were a huge part of that. Rocker, it&#039;s sad to see you go, but we all know this is a risky business, and I can&#039;t begin to imagine the amount of stress vendors are under. It looks like you&#039;ve done well here, and if your gut is telling you it&#039;s time to go, at least you can leave with the knowledge you&#039;ve brought a very special brand of happiness to me, and I&#039;m sure countless others (as this thread will certainly prove ;)). Best of luck in your future, wherever it takes you!

				Having been a long time member it is always sad to see reliable and trusted vendors leave the road.&nbsp; Like Seinfeld said it&#039;s always best to leave when you&#039;re on top!<br />I remember being sent a sample of your MDMA and it was phenomenal stuff. Unfortunately I never returned to your store as the money just never seems to be there when you have it&nbsp; :(<br />Like I said it&#039;s always sad to see trusted vendors leave, but you did your time here and you did it right.&nbsp; I wish you nothing but the best in moving forward with your life. I hope you find much peace and happiness.<br />I have to say that your icon is one of my favorites, it reminds me of my dumb love chocolate lab&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />T

				Nooooo!!! We were just getting started!!! I have to say that it disappoints me that you&#039;re leaving.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only made one order from you, but I felt like I&#039;ve made 100.&nbsp; You were the only vendor that I was comfortable with making my first large order.&nbsp; I read every review and as much of your feedback as possible, and I have to say that I know I&#039;m hard from your only fan.&nbsp; Your professionalism and efficiency made me feel 100% confident in doing business with you.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame to see you go, but I wish you the best in your future endeavors.&nbsp; I know for that you will be missed here on the road.

				I refuse to kiss ass for free drugs, and I don&#039;t accept anything I don&#039;t pay for off of SR for security reasons.<br /><br />That said, I&#039;ve heard so many great things about your shrooms, and I think this is a hilariously awesome way to go out. Hopefully you come back under a new name in a few months like so many vendors seem to do.

				Mr Rocker,<br /><br />I never had a forum account until I saw your announcement.&nbsp; I would like to say that you were a true asset to SR and one of my absolute favorite vendors.&nbsp; I have made many purchases from you and have become accustomed to the process going super smooth.&nbsp; I hold other vendors to the standard you helped set.&nbsp; I appreciate what you have done as anyone could offer the products you have but you did it with grace and true professionalism.&nbsp; I will miss you and SR will have a hole once you leave, we can only hope that it is filled with vendors that offer service comparable to you.&nbsp; Thank you from me and I hope the SR community as a whole.&nbsp; Good luck brother, keep up the good fight.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts. - Abraham Lincoln<br />We hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office. - Aesop <br />The wise man does not expose himself needlessly to danger, since there are few things for which he cares sufficiently; but he is willing, in great crises, to give even his life - knowing that under certain conditions it is not worthwhile to live. - Aristotle

				The fact that you came here to tell everyone you were leaving, and didn&#039;t just book out with people&#039;s money, shows that you&#039;re not only a professional vendor, but a genuine human being as well. You&#039;ve done a lot of great things for the Road and its people, and it won&#039;t be forgotten!<br /><br />Stay safe and good luck!

				Wow, I cannot believe the best vendor in the USA is leaving, I&#039;m literally saddened from the top down.&nbsp; I agree with you though, at least you&#039;re leaving on your own terms and no one elses.&nbsp; No one else can know what it was like to live in your shoes, always looking over your shoulder I assume.&nbsp; The stress would get to anyone.&nbsp; I hope you made enough money and good karma to retire peacefully, and I truly mean that.&nbsp; Best of luck Rocker, I highly doubt anyone can fill the void you will be leaving with your professionalism and obvious passion for the road.

				I&#039;ve eaten shrooms at so many festivals, and concerts, and ive ordered most of the shroom menu here on the road.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your Texas Caps are the best. <br /><br />I called your product another name to keep my competition from finding your strain:&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Tampa Red Cap&quot;.<br /><br />I never had one complaint ever from your supply.<br /><br />It was always in my opinion that your Strain was more like&nbsp; P. Mexicana or P. Tampanensis in that it produced more psilocin than the average Cubensis. That and the optimal harvesting point (closed cap), made your product the best shrooms on the road.<br /><br />Texas baby!!!<br />Rock on!!!!<br /><br />You&#039;ll be back!&nbsp; You know you don&#039;t want a real job unless its at&nbsp; SilkRoad.&nbsp; Nom Nom Nom.<br />

				Yo Rocker, the SR community hates to see any vendor leave that had put time and effort into this. Many people don&#039;t realize what it takes to be a vendor, the paranoia, the sleepless nights etc... <br /><br />I hope you come back and start selling again because I think your in that new years resolution mode and want to better your life totally understood. Some people have no choice have to because this is there income and keeps a roof over there head. <br /><br />I would love a sample of shrooms :)<br /><br />Thanks Rocks for all the special moments you have gave the SR community and you will never be forgotten. <br /><br />

				Look, I&#039;m going to give it to you straight. First shroom order I had on SR was from Rocker. It totally RUINED my subsequent experiences with other shroom vendors because none measured up to ROCKER&#039;s SHROOMs. <br /><br />Yes. That&#039;s what happens when you start at the top, best in class. Life lesson here... start at the bottom first and work your way up. <br /><br />Only one other vendor came close to the quality and potency of Rocker&#039;s shrooms. And by that I mean whole, dried shrooms. <br /><br />Rocker&#039;s shrooms were consistent in quality. Rocker as a vendor was consistent with best in class service. Has also been a true asset to the community - helping many a noob with valuable information and insight. <br /><br />In my estimation, it doesn&#039;t matter when ROCKER decides to leave, because no matter when he leaves, he leaves going out on top. <br /><br />All the best in your future endeavors. Wishing you happiness, health and long life. <br /><br />With kindest regard and brotherly affection, <br /><br />BenJesuit<br /><br /><br />P.S. if you select me, I&#039;m game for some MDMA. But if you run out of that, then of course I would like some of your legendary shrooms.&nbsp;

				Although I haven&#039;t ordered from you, these days of scammers and generally unsavory types tarnishing what is truly a great idea, the community of SR will surely miss a valued vendor of integrity and honesty.&nbsp; And it isn&#039;t just the road, the world needs people like you.&nbsp; People who believe in liberty and freedom and personal sovereignty.&nbsp; I hope you made yourself a nice bundle so you can laugh every time you pass a LEO, or some other &quot;authority&quot; figure.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am sure others have said similar things in this thread, but it is people like you who make the world a better place.&nbsp; You could close up and walk away with a bunch of money.&nbsp; Instead you are handing out, for free, some goodies to say good bye.&nbsp; I admire you and your choice in how you disembark the train you have been riding.<br /><br />I say this because I believe it.&nbsp; I hope the best for you and wish you continued success in your endeavors.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Second post, slow day so I&#039;ve had time to think about this a little more.&nbsp; I think what you are doing is truly commendable.&nbsp; As I was sitting here thinking how awesome it is that you are going to give out a bunch of free product to mark your departure,&nbsp; I realized not only are you giving away product, but also not capitalizing on an opportunity that could net you a handsome profit.&nbsp; Given your track record as a seller on SR, you could have easily put up a bunch of listings, put some bullshit reason as to why FE would be greatly appreciated/necessary this time around, then duck out with everyone&#039;s money.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure every vendor here says they would never do that, but given the anonymity and the 0 real life connections to the buyer, greedy thoughts could easily creep in.&nbsp; I really respect what your doing, it&#039;s good to know vendors like you exist in this community.&nbsp; May your rewards in life be bountiful!

It still shocks me that sellers like you will have sales for your products when obviously you have no trouble selling them.

				Let&#039;s go back to early summer, June or maybe July....<br /><br />First order ever on SR was from Rocker. I was a eager one and was VERY curious about SR and how it all worked.<br /><br />Well, I discovered Bitcointalk.org and truly enough, I got a hold of some anonymous precious bitcoins when they were 5 dollars a pop back then.<br /><br />Took a while to learn to get it transferred to my SR wallet and all, but it got there. Now was the time to choose what I wanted to buy, at the time, I had<br /><br />a local weed man so I wasn&#039;t looking for any weed. I saw the listing for psychedelics and was curious to try some Magic Mushrooms. At the time, this was when<br /><br />Rocker was supplying us with 1/8s and 1/7s (I remember that Rocker!), so I grabbed an eighth and chose to stay in escrow for the safe keeping of my coins (nothing personal <br /><br />rocker) 2 days later, BAM!, the holy package of shrooms came and I was stunned. I couldn&#039;t beleive I actually just ordered some illegal mushrooms through the Deepweb. Holy <br /><br />shit! Later that night, I finally ate the shrooms and hope I wouldn&#039;t trip and see shit because I was having a family reunion at the time. When the peak or onset hit me, I was fucking<br /><br />stunned...I felt amazing for the first time ever in my life!! I actually had a decent and loving conversation with my parents and grandparents without ridiculing one another&#039;s status <br /><br />and relationship. I felt connected with my family for once and was actually about to cry knowing that I was actually having a great time with my family. At the end of the day,<br /><br />everyone greeted each other goodbye and kisses, and the night came to end. I layed in my bed and was amazed and how these little mushies could do such wonders, then I <br /><br />remembered it was all because of you Rocker! <br /><br /><br />Thanks Rocker! Have a good retirement &amp;...we hope to see you back soon :)!<br /><br />Cheers, Saitekman12345<br />

I must have been confusing you with Rook.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve been here 2 months and already I have been offered free drugs (thanks for the opium, Ace! Can&#039;t wait till it arrives) so I&#039;m sure there are many more deserving peeps but I&#039;m going to take a stab at the MDMA anyway :))))<br /><br />My birthday is coming up and we&#039;re renting a party bus and club hopping. I&#039;m inviting about 25 people and the majority will be my hot, sexy girlfriends. If you gift your MDMA to me I will gift it to them (normally I would sell it bc I&#039;m not rich)&nbsp; and it will make for an incredible night!!!&nbsp; I&#039;ll take tons of (blurry) pictures and then make a scrapbook (one for me, one for you) and send it to you :) <br /><br />If that&#039;s not your thIng, I understand. Awesome that you are giving away such treats! I wish you were sticking around so I could have the pleasure of working with yoy. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be missed.

				Oh Rocker. Rocker, Rocker, Rocker.<br /><br />As one moves on, another takes his place... I just discovered this world, and it has been blowing my mind since. The forums are active, informative, and fun. The service is extraordinary. I applaud you for the service you have provided the global market. Sure, you made your money, but you did something more than that. You were there for the people, you gave them what they wanted. You gave them access to the sacred and the divine, you have no doubt opened eyes to they mysteries and glory of our united consciousness. For that, the governments may label you a villain, but you are indeed a hero. You are a rebel on the cutting edge of technology, and you have served the community well. I never got a chance to order for you, I am more into the opioids these days, and I haven&#039;t been on a psychedelic adventure in at least a year or two, but thank you for being part of this revolutionary movement and helping it to grow. I wish you luck on where the path leads you next. Take it easy, brother.<br /><br />&quot;If you have only two alternatives, then choose the third&quot;<br /><br />B<br />

				Wow, this is like losing a first girlfriend to me. I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t realize it but you popped my SR cherry.&nbsp; I made some digital purchases first to get some transactions under my belt, but this was my first &quot;real&quot; purchase. It will actually be 1 year for me at month&#039;s end.&nbsp; I researched vendors, found you,&nbsp; and then got my shit together and ordered. I couldn&#039;t believe that what I was doing was even possible and when that first package arrived I didn&#039;t know if I was dreaming or not. Inside was 1 0z. of what I, and a few friends, consider to be some of the best shrooms we&#039;ve ever eaten. Considering I used to be connected to a grower and even had the pleasure of eating fresh shrooms that is a pretty high honor. <br />Just like a first love I&#039;ll always remember my first taste of SR thanks to Rocker.&nbsp; The transaction was flawless and was key in building my confidence to continue to use SR. If anything had gone wrong I&#039;m not sure if I would have continued to use SR. Sure, I&#039;ve taken lumps since but it was Rocker who showed me the light and turned me into the monster I am today ;D<br />I wish you nothing but the best and would like to Thank You for all that you have done for this community. If it weren&#039;t for honest, reliable vendors like yourself this place would be shit. Much like the other sites that are playing catch-up right now.&nbsp; Whatever you choose I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be successful. If you can do this gig at the level you did you can do anything. Congratulations and enjoy your retirement :)

				Sad to see you go, but I never got a chance to order because I was waiting for you to restock :P<br /><br />Glad you helped lay groundwork for what hopefully will come in the future, hard to find good vendors here and especially hard for new vendors to setup.<br /><br />Not really looking for freebies I&#039;m sure someone with a little less btc could use them, just wanted to say good luck in whatever you choose.

				Truly, and coming from the bottom of my heart I would like to say a thank you, and a dear good-bye.<br /><br />Although I&#039;ve never actually ordered from me, you being in the states and myself being from the UK, I can tell from what everyone else has to say that yopu were a professional vendor, but not only that someone who genuinely cares for other people. The fact that you&#039;ve came here and are giving away FREE stuff, is enough to show that you care about the road as much as the road cares about you. <br /><br />You with your forum posts alone, taught me enough about shrooms to finally make me take the push to try them ( Sadly, I didn&#039;t enjoy my several trips, seems like it&#039;s not the drug for me)<br /><br />You&#039;ll be sorely missed by us all here, I am sure. But, I can tell you&#039;ll be fine with whatever you decide to do. <br /><br />Hell, I don&#039;t even need any of the stuff you&#039;re giving away, I just came in to say good-bye and to wish you luck. <br /><br />WE LOVE YOU, MAN!<br /><br />P.S If you need a suit for some of your job interviews (if you decide to get one) let me know, I have PLENTY!<br /><br />-SlickSuit&nbsp; :)

				Wow dude the fact that you are leaving the game with a free giveaway really says a lot. Sucks to have a vendor like yourself leave. But hey, now you can take some time and relax without the hustle and bustle of making countless trips to ship products. Have a great retirement. Hopefully I can get some of your stuff you are giving out so I can have the chance of trying your wares before they are gone forever.

				Rocker,<br /><br />I am saddened by the fact that I have not had the opportunity to purchase from you. I have been watching you closely since shortly after you started vending, and I have to say that over the course of your vending experience you have become a star in this community.&nbsp; Part of the reason I have been hesitant, as yet, to make a purchase over silk road is due to number of scams and hijinks by vendors coming and going.&nbsp; However, you and a select few other vendors have stood as examples of excellent vendors and have given me enough hope to soon order.&nbsp; That you will not be&nbsp; among the vendors I first order from is a personal tragedy. Alas, I just have not been in the right position quite yet to be able to order. Regardless of the samples you are giving away, I am indebted to you for your encouragement and great example! You will be severely missed, not least by myself!<br /><br />n1ll0

				Rocker no!!!!!!!! Aww man, you were such a great vendor. Your product was phenomenal, your shipping times were excellent, and you had great prices for such good service. In fact, I was just about to place an order for 1 lb of of shrooms within the next couple days. I wish you didn&#039;t have to go, no one I&#039;ve ever done business with has been as professional as Rocker, and tbh, that goes for real life as well. <br /><br />Everyone here is going to miss you and your excellent products, I hope but doubt that some will one day fill your shoes and be the best psychedelic vendor on all of Silk Road. I wish you the best of luck!

Having been a mushroom dealer IRL, it was always a great feeling to give someone something that they truly enjoyed.<br /><br />For the rest of you, there is a plethora of information on how to grow mushrooms online. In fact, it really isn&#039;t all that hard. Just gotta get over that paranoia hump..;)

				Hey Rocker, I&#039;m fairly new here and I&#039;ve made only a few purchases. I&#039;ve seen your name around and although I haven&#039;t tried your product I&#039;m sad to see you go as you had very competitive prices. I don&#039;t have a ton of money being a student (most of my extra money is used for dubstep festivals and the like) and the Molly is the most expensive part, but also the most vital for a great time. I&#039;d love to have some to see Excision &amp; Zomboy! Thanks for having the giveaway, you had a great run on SR from what I can tell. PLUR

				I think that&#039;s an incredible move. I on the other hand am using this site to acquire a long-term goal of having a stash of some of every drug known to man. I have no mushrooms in that stash yet. I&#039;ve never bought from you, but I&#039;ve been on the site for almost a year now and love what it stands for. I&#039;m surprised you&#039;re being so generous as far as willing to give up your stash, and for free? I&#039;m thoroughly impressed either way! Good luck in life!

				I didn&#039;t read all seven pages here, but I will miss you Rocker! I would go so far as to say that you are the #1 vendor on Silk Road and have been for a long long time. I remember when you first showed up here (although vaguely). You pretty much dropped onto SR with a good understanding of customer service, professional attitude, good products, and easy conversation. I have had nothing but pleasurable experience with you, and I wonder who will fill your shoes when you leave. This community is losing a solid asset when you go, and you will be missed. I hope you are able to fill your free time with love and happiness. I am glad to see a high profile vendor leaving under their own terms and in such a graceful manner.<br /><br />stay safe Rocker,<br />wretched

Your product was fantastic and I commend you both as an honest bidnisman and human being. I kind of wish you would stay on the road as youre head and shoulders above nearly every other vendor in all regards but Id rather you do what you thinks best for yourself.

I regret that we won&#039;t be doing more business, but I suspect that you meet with success in &quot;real life&quot; at any rate. Your charm and charisma speak for themselves.

				Hello There Rocker,<br /><br />First of all I&#039;d like to say that I&#039;ve never done business with you and<br />its a shame that I won&#039;t be able to.&nbsp; <br /><br />But leaving that behind, I would love to see an old SR vet help a new<br />guy out !&nbsp; I&#039;m new to the road, and have only made a couple purchases ! But<br />my confidence in the validity of this site has grown immensely, and its because<br />of Vet&#039;s like you.<br /><br />Much love and respect for keeping a fantastic community thriving.&nbsp; <br /><br />~CHEERS<br />-CAMEL

Not saying you are lying, but I don&#039;t remember his shit being postmarked from anywhere near Portland.&nbsp; Either way you make a very valid point. It&#039;s wild how many people are willing to risk security for a freebie. Not saying I haven&#039;t taken part in anything like this myself, I&#039;ve accepted samples in exchange for reviews. But I also believe I&#039;ve taken steps to ensure my security along the way. And since I&#039;m still here it must be working.&nbsp; Rocker is far from a noob, but I did find it odd this dude is giving away roughly half a pound of shrooms and other shit to retire. At first it draws you in, but when you sit back and think about it it really doesn&#039;t make much sense. Rocker&#039;s been straight the whole time but that doesn&#039;t mean shit right now. This could be real or it could be what you say.&nbsp; I hope this isn&#039;t the case but I also hope everyone here realizes that this isn&#039;t a fucking game. The only &quot;Get out of jail free&quot; card here is snitching.&nbsp; I truly hope this isn&#039;t what is going on, but that&#039;s something&nbsp; everyone here is going to have to decide for themselves.

				Rocker, <br /><br />Where do I even begin? I guess it makes sense to start with the second purchase I&#039;d ever made on Silk Road. I had just received a gram of MDMA from Ivory, so I was still riding the high of my first delivery (I&#039;m sure everyone remembers that feeling&nbsp; ;D). So I figured might as well try my second favorite drug next! Mushrooms! I messaged you first, fully expecting to FE because I was relatively new. You responded and told me no big deal, I could stay in escrow. What outstanding customer service that was. A few days later the single greatest mushroom strain I have ever eaten arrived in my mailbox. I never ordered mushrooms from another vendor (actually one time I ordered some mushroom capsules to see what that was like, but that&#039;s off topic). <br /><br />You are forever a part of Silk Road history. I got my hands on your MDMA once and it was the best stuff I&#039;d ever gotten on the site. You were truly a man of the people. You once sent me a message on the forums telling me I awesome and it made my fucking week, because YOU&#039;RE awesome. Silk Road is going to miss you man. And you know what&#039;s awesome? You didn&#039;t go out with a scan. &quot;Ok, beginning of 2013 huge sale, but you have to FE!!&quot; No one here should be surprised that you&#039;re leaving on good terms. You&#039;re an awesome vendor and you always have been. Funny enough, I just received an oz of mushrooms from you in the mail today, and at the time I didn&#039;t even realize it&#039;s the last package I&#039;ll ever receive from you. Damn that&#039;s sad. Well when I do finally take them, I will dedicate a good portion of my trip to the greatest domestic and greatest mushroom vendor I have ever dealt with. I&#039;ve spent upwards of $10,000 here, and I never saw anyone match your professionalism and customer service, and of course product. Thank you for everything you&#039;ve done for the site. You&#039;ve certainly lived up to your name my friend, because you ROCK.<br /><br />Aw geez, I had to go and end it on a stupid pun. Quick Divine, think of something better, you can do it! <br /><br />Ooh, I know! I&#039;ll write you a sonnet!<br /><br />Shall I compare thee to a summer&#039;s day?<br />Because in the summer I took your shrooms<br />And wandered a park watching flowers sway<br />To the beat of the world. Wash away gloom,<br />For Rocker has healed my mind, eased my pain.<br />I check the mail with such delight, I hope<br />To see a package from you once again,<br />A box, contents more divine than the Pope.<br />But now this Silk Road legend will be gone,<br />And nevermore his gift shall I ingest.<br />I feel like I have run a marathon,<br />I gasp, and think &quot;My god. We&#039;ve lost the best.&quot;<br />Along the Silk Road&#039;s Hall of Champs you walk,<br />And written on the wall the words &quot;YOU ROCK.&quot;<br /><br />Goddamnit, I ended it with the same pun. Oh well. We love you Rocker! Thanks for being an amazing vendor for the past year and a half!

				LOL. The ideas that pop into the heads of some people here. <br /><br />Rocker is a legend and one of the earliest vendors on here. He&#039;s made mad loot selling that giving away goodies at the end won&#039;t make a dent in his accumulated profits. Consider also that SR isn&#039;t his only selling venue. <br /><br />As for the possibility of a controlled delivery, well, consider that you didn&#039;t buy it and you won&#039;t have to sign for it if you happen to be one who rocker chooses to give to. Sure, they are quantities well above personal use. So if you are one of the lucky ones to benefit from Rocker&#039;s largess, just hide it when it comes. <br /><br />And to the notion of address harvesting... every vendor could be engaging in that and you&#039;d never know it until it is too late. What? You think because you&#039;re using PGP you&#039;re safe from such a thing? LOL. <br /><br />Now keep that paranoid crap out of this thread. Start another thread about it if you must pound your chest to celebrate how security conscious you think you are. <br /><br />Have some respect for an OG SR vendor. Vendors like Rocker helped to make Silk Road what it is today - what you enjoy today. DPR didn&#039;t do all this by himself. It was vendors with integrity that set the standard. Rocker is one such.&nbsp;

				Damn, sorry to see you go Rocker! I was all over your QP&#039;s and actually just put the BTC in my account to purchase another one :(<br /><br />On the flip side, I&#039;m happy to see you go... I can tell from all my past business experience with you (I&#039;m chutney on SR) that you&#039;re a great person, great salesman and your heart is in the right spot. I fear SR is nearing its end, it&#039;s getting too big, too fast and attracting way too much media attention. In that sense I am glad to see you get out of here before it might potentially end very differently for you.... A big part of succeeding in this game (especially when you get toward the upper echelons as you have Rocker) is knowing when to get out, before it ends badly. <br /><br />So in a way, it totally sucks to see you go. Now I&#039;m sitting on 900$ worth of BTC and wont be able to enjoy anymore of your fucking amazing LSD, which also kinda sucks. But overall I&#039;m happy to see a good vendor come out on top... In this game you hear a lot of horror stories and very few &quot;Thanks for the time here, I&#039;m getting out while the getting is good&quot; stories.<br /><br />This is a SR success story folks. I&#039;d say all the vendors in the top 10% should look closely at what Rocker did here and take note. It&#039;s not going to be good to be at the top of this thing if (god forbid) this thing ever gets busted. I know the vendors in the top 10% are making bank and I think its important that people follow in Rockers footsteps and know when to call it quits. Though I don&#039;t vend here on SR, I have a number I set in my head a long time ago.... when I get to that number I&#039;m done.<br /><br />Hopefully I&#039;ll see you on some tropical beach when I get to my end game Rocker... I&#039;ll buy ya a drink&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Take care, enjoy yourself and last but not least; thanks for everything. <br /><br />We love you

				Onward!<br /><br />Though I&#039;m very much new to the Road, you were one of the first vendors to come onto my radar as I spent those few excited weeks researching every inch of this site/community. At first it seemed like a dream or fantasy, but before I knew it I was making my first heart-pounding cash drop with CaptainMal, fiddling with PGP, BEGGING fair vendors to take a chance on a newbie, and pulling my hair out for a week during the ship. It came the day before Chirstmas :) the Road&#039;s been good to me so far.<br /><br />I&#039;m truly bummed that you&#039;ll be leaving. I was working my way up to finance a purchase of your larger batches of mushrooms. This is a bit like Luke watching Obi-Wan fall just after he took his first steps into a larger world... or maybe I just like Star Wars too much... Alas I&#039;ll have to move on as well and find the next rockstar vendor worthy of my adoration and aspirations! Thank you for all that you&#039;ve done: putting up the risk, dealing with us weirdos, and gifting us all the food of the gods.<br /><br />Happy travels. May you champion all your future endeavors or rest easy having finished the good work.

He replied on exactly the 120th post, and made no mention whatsoever to choosing some people to get his lovely drugs. His post only mentioned that he was touched AND giving away MORE free drugs. I completely see that cops work up, not down, but I dont understand his logic. Im sure he has plenty of friends who would give him a hug and a kiss for some free lovin. I would prefer that to the text messages he gets from us. The only thing I can think is that he would rather send them to others because he has a legit buisness in his area, but then he would sell those too.<br /><br />Cops still arrest people smokin a joint on the street, even though its total bullshit. Hell I saw a guy while I was in jail who was arrested for sleeping on a bench! FUCK THAT. All cops are pigs. I dont think rocker is a pig, I just am confused as to his actions. He has over 100 people wanting drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can anyone verify that rocker is rocker through encrypted message?? THEHOMIE sent a message tho, Was it encrypted bro?<br /><br />Can anyone verify that they know rocker in person and KNOWS that he is alive and well??

He replied on exactly the 120th post, and made no mention whatsoever to choosing some people to get his lovely drugs. His post only mentioned that he was touched AND giving away MORE free drugs. I completely see that cops work up, not down, but I dont understand his logic. Im sure he has plenty of friends who would give him a hug and a kiss for some free lovin. I would prefer that to the text messages he gets from us. The only thing I can think is that he would rather send them to others because he has a legit buisness in his area, but then he would sell those too.<br /><br />Cops still arrest people smokin a joint on the street, even though its total bullshit. Hell I saw a guy while I was in jail who was arrested for sleeping on a bench! FUCK THAT. All cops are pigs. I dont think rocker is a pig, I just am confused as to his actions. He has over 100 people wanting drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can anyone verify that rocker is rocker through encrypted message??

				I too received an order from Rocker just this week, so the paranoia can stop. An old drug buddy of mine told me there are three ways to leave the game: You get killed, you get arrested, or you retire on your own terms. There is no fourth option &quot;go on forever.&quot; Rocker is doing the smart thing and getting out before something bad happens. <br /><br />BTW if we&#039;re supposed to name what we want if we&#039;re chosen as a winner, then my pick would be shrooms since I can get MDMA easily anyways, and I have some friends that have been dying to try shrooms for the first time. I want to give them enlightenment. <br /><br />Really cool of you to to do this giveaway Rocker.

				i have been a SR member for 1.5 years and only ordered from Rocker twice. She gave me super service both times. Once was shrooms which have been the strongest by weight i have ever done. The people i turned on also felt that those Texas strain were the most potent they had done. Then this past spring, april i got some mdma from her ( i say her because i think Rocker is a chick), it was a super clean roll, very lovey dovey, but then there was no more until recently and i wasn&#039;t able to get my shit together to buy some before her retirement. The service was VERY, speedy, and imo stealth was above adequate. You will be missed on the Road Rocker. i hope you resurface with a different moniker and continue to help the world be a better place. Thanks for all that you have done!!!

				First off I love your profile pic. I just love how the dog is happy flingin&#039; his tongue around like he&#039;s having the time of his life! XD<br />I remember ordering some shrooms from you and they were way more potent than I thought. I actually tripped way more than I expected and was unprepared for it. I don&#039;t know about the weed but from what people say, it&#039;s on par with your shrooms in terms of potency.<br /><br />Can I ak what a weed dealer lifestyle is like (obviously without detail) I can&#039;t imagine what it would be like, being the bearer of happiness and making money for selling a miracle drug illegally.

				Imagine if Rocker was only kidding and got all of this attention right before a massive sale on MDMA and shrooms?!?&nbsp; :o<br />We can all dream, I guess. <br /><br />But seriously, it seems as though you had a fantastic reputation and one that was only preceded by the drugs you sent. As both an MDMA + Shrooms connoisseur (under a different SR username, of course), I would love to try your stuff for the first and last time. Although I would imagine, if it is as good as others have described, I might start a massive search across the states to meet IRL and get more. Or more likely, just write an epic trip report to send your off to retirement. <br /><br />Cheers - dream.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hey Rocker, thank you for popping my SR cherry, only been on here now for a little over a month and it sucks to see that your leaving now!! :(..... You were my first successful purchase on here and the shrooms were hands down best I&#039;ve EVER had, rocked mine and my friends world, totally mindblowing! So then I ordered another ounce and had a very intense/scary/bad trip that freaked me out to the point of not wanting to touch mushrooms again for awhile lol, amazing shrooms, they changed the way I think about quite a bit of things and I&#039;d like to thank you for that....... I wouldve definetly have been buying more, the price was great, quality fucking fantastic, communication was the best I&#039;ve had on SR so far, and delivery was super fast with no problems, its just the fact that I was pretty scared to eat anymore of your shrooms haha..... Well anyway I didn&#039;t even know you had mdma for sale too but I&#039;d loooooove to try some of that beautiful stuff, I recently had a buddy fuck me over on a lot of cash so a free five gram bag of molly would make me cry, just thinking about it I&#039;m tearing up, I&#039;ve been struggling lately, and I&#039;ve pushed a lot of my selfish habits away for my family and loved ones, I just could not imagine getting a free five gram bag of mdma........ Anyways it sucks to see that your going so soon, I wanted to try your liquid lsd too but just couldn&#039;t get enough bitcoin for a whole vial, your shrooms definetly rocked my world though man, I have no clue who you are but I will ALWAYS remember Rocker&#039;s shrooms, take care.

				You post this thread on a very special day that commemorates my being on this earth for an exact amount of years, no overlay of days or weeks, and on that day I decided &quot;I won&#039;t check the forums, no, I&#039;ll go out and enjoy myself!&quot; And for the four days since, I have done that. I come back to the lovely and varied forums to find this, a retirement notice from one of the most celebrated vendors in this magical place...and I promptly kick myself in the ass. I&#039;ve always perused your wares, wondering the day when I&#039;d find the stones to order a bulky package, such as your fruits, and get to taste the sweet, sweet fungus so many have clamored for and spoken volumes of good word about.<br /><br />I write this to you in an attempt to just even garner a fraction of your attention, so that I may get down on the finest fruits of the Road. I&#039;ve tried growing several times to no avail, and have recently given up in my endeavors. My hands are perhaps too heavy for the delicate nature of fungus, and thus, I plead you to help me, so that I may treat my friends&#039; and my own mind to a little bit expansion, compression and enlightenment.<br /><br />I hope you find success in all of your endeavors outside of SR and general mycology, and that you do so with a smile on your face and a song in your heart.<br /><br />warmest regards,<br /><br />mrhaircut

The Mushroom Cultivator, Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms, and Mycelium Running all by Paul Stamets, Mushroom Miscellany by Patrick Harding, and Psilocybin Mushroom Handbook by L.G. Nicholas and Kerry Ogame&#039;....<br /><br />I wonder how my journey will turn out?&nbsp; &nbsp;I find fungi the most interesting subject and substance bar none.&nbsp; The Psychedelic experience has changed my life..&nbsp; I know it has changed the lives of many people from all walks of life..

The powers that be are doing more harm than good.. <br /><br />I am just 30 days old here at SR.&nbsp; I saw the vendor name &quot;Rocker&quot; while looking at mushrooms and figured that I might purchase from him/her when I wanted to make that purchase... I have seen many here praise Rocker&#039;s fungi and vial&#039;s of LSD.&nbsp; I was just a little late in getting here... I do thank you for what you have done for this community... :)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Any chance you might offer some spore prints, or some other way of gifting your selected fungi?&nbsp; Beginners like myself would love to just have a helping hand at growing this most precious gift for others to experience...<br /><br />And Hendrix said... &quot;Not necessarily stoned... but beautiful.&quot;<br /><br />Much Respect+<br />stiffneck

				Rocker was one of my first vendors to order from. Being a noob at the time, I screwed up the address and it got sent back. Most sellers I feel would have said, &quot;Your fault, dumbass&quot; but Rocker gave me a great discount on a reorder to make up for it. Ever sense then I have order many QPs of Marijuana and Mushrooms from Rocker and have never been let down. He has without a doubt been my favorite seller on the Road to date. I&#039;m sad to see him leave but am glad to see he is stopping under his free will and not by other means. I wish there was more people like Rocker around. People like Rocker are perfect examples of what this community stands for. He has always shown kindness, professionalism, and an eagerness to help others. People like Rocker are what make this place great.

				I was planning to make my first order from Rocker when I read the message that the jig was up<br /><br />Nobody gets the feedback that Rocker does without being the best of the best, as a vendor and as a person. That&#039;s one of the main reasons I was going to buy in the first place.<br /><br />

				When experienced vendors such as Rocker leave, they take with them a stack of knowledge and proven methods of operating a successful vending account on SR, demonstrating how things should and could be done. :(&nbsp; If only that information could filter through to some of the newer vendors, we&#039;d all be better for it. For Rocker to have successfully run his business on SR for a long time shows that precious information he has attained over time might be lost forever, which is such a shame. Good luck with everything mate and enjoy the fruits of your labor.&nbsp; :)

				&nbsp; Rocker you will be missed!<br /><br />It was always nice throwing a football of the baddest shrooms at my buddy and just knowing how many 3rd eyes were going to be opened that weekend.&nbsp; I never got to try your MJ, I had JUST funded and was wanting a HP when I saw the notice you were getting out. Well its better youre the one giving that news that anyone else,like you said.<br /><br /><br />Hopefully some new vendors will come along with half the kindness, honesty and quality product that Rocker was known for. The shrooms were legendary &quot;cracker dry brain burners&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Good luck in your future endeavors, Aoth<br />

				I couldn&#039;t believe my eyes when I logged on to Rocker&#039;s page today. My heart dropped. I just want to go on record and say that the transaction I had with Rocker made my life so much better. It was without a doubt the best experience I&#039;ve had on the road. The boomers&nbsp; got me though the holiday and really helped me to reconnect with nature and the universe and my spiritually and so on... this is a priceless gift! I can honestly say I am a better, more complete human being for having interacted with Rocker. A BIG THANK YOU, ROCKER! <br /><br />Please take care of yourself and continue to spread your positive energy out into this world. anyway you can. This page is one that goes above and beyond the call of duty and it makes being a part of this community worthwhile and something to cherish. You will be missed sorely as I can see by your supporters. <br /><br />NEVER STOP ROCKING!<br /><br />...I am eternally thankful for your devotion, risk, and commitment to the cause...<br /><br /><br />God Bless, <br /><br />NDogg<br /><br /><br /><br />

				To be Honest Rocker i cant remember if iv already posted or not, i take XANAX so i have memory issues.<br /><br />I wish you the best of luck with your future Endeavors and all the happiness life can bring you that you brought to silkroad.<br />If you dont choose to send me anything thats fine to,id really of course enjoy something but im here to wish a SR MEMBER VENDOR /GOOD GUY a Fair well!!! Its always good to pull out ahead of time with certain situations and that seems to be what your doing , maybe just not wanting the hustle and bsutle of all the work it takes to put into being&nbsp; a full time vendor, I thought about being a part time one, but i just couldnt do it full time and My hat Is off to you and all the other SR vendors that do their Job as good as they do, aoaf course we have our few ass&#039;s on here that have to make it bad but this is a great community even though its based on pretty much drugs. It just goes to show How wrong people are about drug users. I have met more Intelligent,Nice,caring,and just freaking awesome people here that i have ever met on any other board,and like i said beside the few that fuck it up, we are a shyning example of there is nothing wrong with using drugs!! Just try not to let it get out of controle<br /><br />With all that being said my friend,&nbsp; I hope you have made enuff money off here to fulfill some of your dreams, or at least close enough and some of your major wants and you&nbsp; can maybe go sit back on a island somewhere and just enjoy the money u have made sip margaritas and BANG SENERETAS !!! LOL Im not gonna keep on and on you get the idea of what im saying bro.. GOOD LUCK BE SAFE AND BE HAPPY!!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S. give it to someone worthy!!

I enjoy the Road very much and I hope to see you again soon!<br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll &quot;apply&quot; to your give away. I&#039;ve never tried shrooms before, so that would be a plus if I won anything :D<br /><br />Also, if you have any maryjane, I&#039;ll &quot;apply&quot; for that as well.<br /><br />Again, nice to finally meet you, and good luck with your future endeavors.

Relax, play some golf, enjoy nature, spend time with family, there is so many awesome things to do in retirement, have a wonderful life, period.

				Rocker, <br /><br />I&#039;ve never ordered from you, but I do remember you from the listings.<br /><br />Lately it seems that vendor retirement has been synonymous with going rogue.

But 5 grams of MDMA? That would fry my brain, of course i will be giving some out, iv already offerd some to jagfug and a few other. If Anybody on here wants a little bit id be glade to throw a little there way, cause 5 grams is allot of MDMA! <br /><br />I mean berry if some one i gave some capsules to likes them and would like to buy a few then i wont turn down the money.<br />Im sure rocker give this stuff away to do with as we wanted. Also i know she would not want me to take 5 grams of it myself. But i did realize the distaste in it and as u see changed it. <br /><br />So No offense taken to heart and lets move on.<br /><br />Also to the one TK whatever who had something smart to say, I type in caps allot and i have explained why, I cant see well and i didnt think it was that big a deal that i put my caps on so i can see the letters.. My glasses r broken and im waiting on another pair to come in.. SO fuck u&nbsp;

				Although I have nothing coming from Rocker I just wanted to say how incredibly awesome it is to see this happening. It was one thing to say it but now as people are receiving the gifts it&#039;s inspiring.&nbsp; Rocker was legendary as a vendor and this just brings that to an almost mythical if not godlike status. I believe the legend of Rocker will always go hand in hand with that of SR.&nbsp; Rocker, if you are reading I really hope the rest of your days are as beautiful as your exit was. Thank you for showing the true greatness of SR to all of us.

				So have any of the MDMA winners tried the MDMA YET??? Just curious. <br /><br />Iv yet to try it out. Iv got MDA also to mix, but i think im gonna just try the MDMA all by itself. Has such a funny color to it. <br /><br />I already know its gonna be awesome. Iv decided though since im not someone who can do 5grams worth. Im giving half to a friend who loves the stuff.. Just playing it forward. I was gonna cap some and sell but Just wouldnt be right, and thnx berry 13 for actually making me realize that.<br /><br />I am however gonna keep a Gram for myself just to have for that special lady and special nights !!! Nothing like some great freaking Euphoric xtra sensitive x10 MDMA to better the sex!!<br /><br /><br />Thnx again rocker!!!.<br /><br />Somebody write some experiances!! lol

				really wish I got to see this thread sooner... not so I could get free drugs but so I could have a much better chance of having my post read but alas.... I shall post anyways :)<br /><br /><br />I haven&#039;t made a huge amount of purchases with you, Rocker. The few I did make, I was obviously as satisfied as can be. Not just because I paid a fair price, received quality product/service.... but because I knew the man profiting off of my consumption was a good honest man... and this thread only serves to confirm that.<br /><br />I remember the SR outtage back in November.... just as it was coming to an end someone said &quot;I&#039;ve gotten on a couple times but haven&#039;t been able to do much... in other news rocker is back!!!&quot; (not exact quotes). THAT is the types of posts you only see about EXCELLENT vendors. <br /><br />I also remember how you put up the Bassnectar logo on your listings around Christmas time.... it was the peak of my holiday spirits.... I must tell you<br /><br /><br />All that said, farewell Rocker. As sad as I am that a good honest vendor is leaving. I feel secure with the thought that a good man made a profit on here, brought smiles and good times to his consumer base... all with no charges filed. Well done, sir. Peace love freedom liberty mushrooms smiles laughter and of course good vibes in any other form they come in c:
