				Hi, I placed a small order with a uk vendor early yesterday. I chose him as he normally posts same day, meaning I could be fairly sure it would arrive today or Monday.I always FE as trust vendor. This is important to me as I don&#039;t want Missus to open package! This is why I only use uk to uk vendors.<br />However this time the order is still processing. Please understand this isn&#039;t a complaint against vendor. He could have any number of reasons why he hasn&#039;t processed as promptly as usual. But due to reasons above I might need to cancel if it doesn&#039;t go through today.<br />What I want to know is if I cancel will BTC go straight back to my balance? And will I incur any kind of penalty or bad feedback? <br />Edit: I notice from vendors page he hasn&#039;t visited for 2 days. This wasn&#039;t a problem yesterday, I guess a lot of vendors only check for orders once or twice daily ( if it were me I&#039;d check at midday and maybe an hour before last post). But now it looks like he might be away for weekend. It would be nice if vendors could indicate this on their page. For instance, the other vendor I was going to use had a message saying orders won&#039;t be processed until Tuesday: very thoughtful I thought.

				Ah cheers mate. That&#039;s a problem then as if I could contact him I wouldn&#039;t be in this situation. It&#039;s not that bad as the stuff isn&#039;t coming to home address but I prefer absolutely no risk of mrs interception! To me the wife is a far more real danger than LE. The police can fine me and tell me off but she can REALLY fuck me up!

				You can cancel orders on here after it&#039;s status is &#039;Processing&#039; for 4 days.<br />Other than that, try and shoot the vendor a mail to explain the situation. <br />Hopefully they&#039;ll see it over the weekend.<br /><br />Mrs Interception is the worst kind. . . dog house for at least a week!<br />Happened me recently and her problem was that I got the stuff for a lads night out, not for her and me! :/
