				I guess I could post this in one of the existing threads, but I figured I&#039;d get my two cents out there as best as possible. I apologize for clogging up this board any more but this is a big topic right now so I&#039;ll take shit for it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This is my first post on these forums, I stumbled onto the silk road a long time ago and found it to be a humorous deep web novelty. After the realization that drugs are actually something worth paying money for sometimes this site took on a useful side to me. Therefore, the recent issue of guns and S.R. is very worrisome to me, as it potentially threatens the silk road as we know it and seems to be causing a deep division amongst it&#039;s users. I&#039;ve seen a lot of hatred coming from the pro-gun camp. I&#039;m a liberal (and this is where some of you will stop reading) but I believe in one&#039;s rights to bear arms responsibly for protection, and a gun will get you out dangerous or life-threatening situations if used correctly. However, unless there is a tank vendor on silk road, you wont be able to buy anything here that will protect you from an impending totalitarian future, so it would be great if people could cool it with ideological fight-the-power crap and have a reasonable debate here.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe what we must really figure out, and what the operators of the silk road must ask themselves, and what we must ask them, is whether or not the road is truly strong enough to withstand what will be brought against it. If S.R. can handle all-out cyber warfare with the powers that be, then a level-headed gun trade should be hosted here. We must all remember that gunpowder moved alongside opium on the real silk road.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If S.R. can&#039;t take the heat however, then guns should go for now, there is always the future when we are stronger. I understand and support the desire to make a means of protection and empowerment available to those living in countries where it is deprived, sometimes you need a gun to stay safe. However there is no need to destroy the successful marketplace we have here out of blind ideology, especially when there are other places on the internet where you can procure a gun just as successfully. Will it really be worth for a handful of people to get a gun off this site and then have the hammer come down? The U.S. DEA is incompetent and doesn&#039;t really give a fuck, the ATF is incompetent but doesn&#039;t fuck around, as we&#039;ve seen at Waco.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Just a few more things that come to mind here. Guns are fun and so are drugs (although combining the two I can&#039;t recommend). This site did start out as a drug marketplace though, so it would be nice to see those pro-gun users to respect that bit of history and play nice. It would also be greatly helpful to hear more from pro-gun users from outside outside the U.S. (or states where gun restrictions are tight in the U.S.). In many places in the states obtaining a firearm is pretty damn easy (not that it shouldn&#039;t be) so being in that situation and needing to buy an unregistered/difficult to trace weapon is kind of sketchy as fuck and doesn&#039;t help make the pro-gun argument look any more legitimate.<br /><br />Just my thoughts.<br />

				I think anyone buying a gun off the darknet should go ahead and march right down to the Pig Pen (police station) and reserve a cell in advance. If a small drug shipment gets detected it&#039;s often not worth LE time or money to pursue it. When it comes to guns though, even one will bring the cops to your door at least in the USA. Sending firearms through the mail is a federal offense. I&#039;m also shocked people wouldn&#039;t be skeptical of the sudden appearance of firearms on SR after the recent Fast and Furious sting operation the ATF put on (blew up in their face btw). The entire operation involved intentionally making guns available for purchase so they could trace where they ended up and map out the who&#039;s and what&#039;s of the gun trade headed into Mexico. They&#039;re catching hell for how the operation was ill conceived and failed so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they were attempting the same thing on SR now to try and redeem the sting program&#039;s reputation and standing with congress. Let&#039;s also not forget there&#039;s no way to prove a gun doesn&#039;t have bodies on it before you get busted with it and they start demanding an explanation.

				I disagree with weapons being on SR, simply for the fact they draw more heat. I have no personal issues if someone wants to purchase illegal firearms otherwise.
