				Not from me, but let us know how it goes for you!&nbsp; I have a medium opiate tolerance and have been debating if ordering some poppy pods would be a cheaper alternative to the high ticket meds I rely on.<br /><br />Somebody here should have some insight on best practices!

				Back when Poppies were available on ebay, I got into the tea for awhile. I found that it worked fairly well, but it tastes like total crap. If I were able to keep it down, I&#039;d get a nice buzz from it - even with a tolerance.<br /><br />What I did was grind them down, add boiling water and the juice from a lemon - and let it soak until the water was cool - then strain and chug. <br /><br />Then I&#039;d take the grounds and put them in a pot and boil them for about 15 minutes, let cool, strain, and boil to reduce to about 1/4 cup, which I&#039;d save for later that night or the following morning - the second extraction was pretty weak.

				Pods are just the seed pods of the poppy flower once they&#039;ve reached maturity. The same thing people score when trying to harvest opium but they can be used to make badass opiate tea. It is possible to grow indoors but it isn&#039;t very efficient. The money you&#039;d spend on energy powering lights wouldn&#039;t cost much less than just buying the pods online. Better to scatter seeds outside in the early winter and let nature run its course. There&#039;s nothing illegal about growing poppies ;D

				You want to use about two pods per dose and make sure they&#039;re well ground up, in a coffee grinder or something. Steep in boiled water for about 15 mins, strain and chug.

I think I&#039;ll stop at this point, because I can start to feel it. It&#039;s a very pleasant body numbing feeling right now :-D<br /><br />I&#039;m simmering the liquid from second extraction. I will let it all boil off, and I hear the sticky goo left behind can be smoked... kinna like Opium :-D<br /><br />What a great day this is!

				Just remember water boils at 212F at sea level and at temperatures above 180F the active ingredients will start to degrade.<br />If you are evaporating off the water to make goo it&#039;s best to use a double boiler setup or a very wide pan with a small fan blowing over it.<br />I found the lemon juice to be unnecessary but in regards to pod tea there are many many different styles, just avoid boiling if possible.<br />Bottoms up! :D<br /><br />T

				The best is eat poppy, you really ingest all without wastage. You guys should try fresh poppy eating, It&#039;s quite nice actually, and after completing a pod you will be couch-locked, being unable to continue to the 2nd pod for something. But poppy goes over-ripped fast.<br /><br />C&#039;mon man, you&#039;d drain and throw the pulp away?<br /><br />Erm... anyway, still got a KG of coca tea to clear :(

				Have you guys tried those pods listed by that austrian guy?<br /><br />He says it&#039;s for tea, but looks like they could be eaten instead, right?<br /><br />Right now hist product isn&#039;t listed.
