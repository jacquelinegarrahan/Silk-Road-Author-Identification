				Hey everyone :)<br /><br />I finally got my SR vendor account up and running. I read the seller FAQ and as much else as I could.<br /><br />I&#039;m still a bit worried about starting to sell. I&#039;m intending on selling a product for a price that is far less than the two leading competitors and I&#039;m afraid I might get shit from them for doing so. Is there any reason I should price it slightly under the competitors price or can I just go ahead and sell it for whatever I want and not worry about it?<br /><br />So basically, if I got this right, I should start a thread announcing that my vendor account is operational? What about samples? What I&#039;m selling is the brand-name pharm and there&#039;s really nothing to &quot;test&quot;, but if samples are a good idea, I&#039;m all for it. I already have a trusted member here than can vouch for me, as he helped me set up my account in exchange for some of my product.<br /><br />Thanks a lot guys.

				Ok make a listing for a sample, and ask people to post on the forum (this thread) if they would like to test your wares... Charge them S/H and keep it in escrow... once they get the product have them post in the thread and vouch for validity. I would say 5-10 samples depending on your cost. Good luck and welcome to Silk Road&#039;s market

				If you can offer a product for cheaper, more power to you! You should do it to at least establish yourself with the community and hopefully the competition will drive the other prices down. Some categories prices just keep going up cause one person takes advantage of people and then everyone&#039;s prices are basically extortion just because they can be and will post it for as much as people will pay. I just refuse to buy from these vendors... so I am grateful to see you want to offer your product for cheaper and I completely support you.<br /><br />Secondly, if you are within the US, use delivery confirmation on your packages. You can pick em up at the post office and attach extra postage to pay for em. These will prove that a package was delivered to the address, and prevent scammer buyers from saying that a parcel never arrived. There are many good threads about package profiling and the correct way to ship your product to ensure you do not attract unnecessary attention and it is important to adhere to these policies for the safety of your buyer and yourself.<br /><br />I also support the sample idea, for the price it costs you... to reputable members, usually &gt;100 posts or whatever the vendor decides. This should be done on the main site through escrow, and you would just request each person leaves a review for you in exchange for the discount. <br /><br />If you pharm just happens to be oxycodone (or related opioid) I would be interested in trying a sample and leaving a review of your service most likely. <br /><br />Feel free to ask any questions, just search first cause theyve probably been answered nearly a hundred times.<br />Good luck,<br />- miR<br /><br />
