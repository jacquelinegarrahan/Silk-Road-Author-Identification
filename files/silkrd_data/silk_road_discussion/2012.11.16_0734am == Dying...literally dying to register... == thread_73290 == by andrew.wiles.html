Theres so much disrespect on here its so unreal. everyone including the vendors were first time buyers at one point and this was when their wasnt much info on the clearnet so we took time researching and when we got on SR we were fully prepared. Unfortunately the popularity of the site means that theres now unlimited info on the web, media and general gossip on the street. this has caused an influx of people jumping straight on like its amazon and not really having a clue what to do. I still feel priveliged to have such a great service. I was a buyer before and have only just started vending and its horrible to see these forums in the past week. Imagine how disheartend DPR feels when he has one second to look at the forums. Its as if all the newbies i trying to get him to say enough is enough. Guy deserves a break

				with closed or invite only registration you would eliminate: <br /><br />1) random, desperate youngsters who stumble across the site and register for everything that has a username just because they like making up new ones and end up ordering some 2C-B only to overdose.....<br />2) scammers like MTLjohn creating multiple shill accounts so they can perpetrate their fuckwad schemes every which way....<br />3) law enforcement pigs who try to set up sting ops and infiltrate the whole god damn site....<br />4) spam idiots with names like &quot;gfdrhrehre&quot;.....<br /><br />the list goes on man. closed and invite only would be like utopia, if you didn&#039;t know someone on the site already with an invite you would have to wait first and strike up a forum presence and earn your keep that way. sounds like big mac with special k sauce to me bababaaay<br /><br />-chicken fingers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
