				Title says it all..<br /><br />I have no physical problems, could make a case for a few psychological ones. But how do you find doctors that are willing to write a prescription. What kind of doctros do you go to?<br /><br />Disclaimer - I live in a weed friendly state so it should be that hard right?

				Ugh,<br /><br />I don&#039;t live in the US, but the usual reasons for writing them out are various(and of course depending on the doctor), but anxiety, insomnia and depression are the usual reasons. <br /><br />Fake one of them or all of them and I&#039;d say you&#039;d get the prescription.<br /><br />Also, try to approach it carefully, because the doctor might prescribe you something like pills, try to say something like: &quot;When I googled(laugh as you&#039;re saying this) my symptoms, I find out that medical cannabis could be the solution, but at first I thought it&#039;s silly, because it&#039;s an illegal drug, but could you elaborate on this?&quot; Or something alike. <br /><br />I hope this helped.<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I don&#039;t know what state you&#039;re in. I&#039;m in CA, and here there are doctors who specialize in doing 215 cards (Proposition 215 was what legalized medical mj).<br /><br />I think NORML has a good state by state list. http://norml.org/<br /><br />You&#039;re best off going to a doctor who is known to support medical mj.<br /><br />Hope that helps<br />HH

				How do you find doctors that support MMJ? And what do you tell them when you get there? I think I am just going to say that I have anxiety and thats it, not much point in lying..

				Easiest way to find a doc is to have a dispensary/caretaker recommend one.&nbsp; At that point it&#039;s paperwork and a visit to the office and you&#039;re done.&nbsp; I think in some states the scripts are 99% for chronic pain.&nbsp; Tell him you have back spasms or some shit and that pot helps, done.

				Since marijuana is still a DEA schedue 1 drug, no one can have a real perscription for it.&nbsp; The closest you could come would be a marinol perscription, and i would love to hear if anyone knows how to fake their way into a script for that.<br /><br />The way medical pot works, at least in my state, is the doctor simply writes a recomendation that marijuana may help you with your condition.&nbsp; The state law should have the acceptable conditons in it, just find some that are easy to fake and go with it.&nbsp; Obviously you cant fake the serious condions like cancer, glaucoma, and aids but there are usually some vague conditons like chronic pain, chronic nausea, or muscle spasams.<br /><br />Like others have said, find a pot doc.&nbsp; I have never heard of anyone who filled out the paperwork and paid the fees for the program being denied.

				Chronic pain is one of the easiest ways to commit insurance fraud so id imagine that would translate easily into getting a prescription.<br />You tell the doctor that you are getting random shooting pains in your back. ( when you reach out, stretch etc )<br />the doctors only way of testing this is to move your arm around into a few different positions.<br />the moment your arm reaches over a 45 degree angle give it some &quot; oh its tightening&quot; &quot;ouch ouch etc&quot;<br />The pain will center around the top of your spine and shoot up into the neck.<br />Alas i dont live in a state or indeed country were I have chance of getting MM, but I did get a couple of nice weeks off work.<br />As to the above comment about getting prescribed pills, its a possibility, however in this country people will take whatever the <br />doc prescribes, dont bother taking, go back a week later and say they are having no effect and you would like to try something else.<br />thats the way you work up to the good meds.<br /><br />Peace
