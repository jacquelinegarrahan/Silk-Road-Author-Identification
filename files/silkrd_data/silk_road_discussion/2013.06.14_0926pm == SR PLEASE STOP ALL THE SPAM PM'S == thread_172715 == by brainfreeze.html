				You can stop the cheap bitcoin spam to your forum acct by going to your Account Settings under Profile at the top. There is a little check box that says &quot;show others my online status&quot;. Uncheck it, and that should stop all the spam to your forum account<br /><br />Peace

				Ye Im getting them every day 10-20-30 the names keep changing but the messages are the same shit viagra stuff. You cant blame SR as they keep using new profiles, SR shut one down but they are already using another. I dont know how they could stop it from happening. Its a pain in the arse but I dont want to blame SR they have their plates full, I dont mind a little hassle.<br /><br />They are pricks tho. No one is sending them shit, money or whatever so they might just give up coz they get nothing for it.<br /><br />We&#039;re all agreed they are cunts. Some times I think that the bad people on SR are actually competitors trying to shit stir and make this the best site look bad, this place is the shit. Love it. <br /><br />Its a pain in the arse but you can deal with the problems, you just delete a load of messages. Im sure SR will sort some thing sooner or later, just chill out. They are all dicks tho.<br /><br />Hey where are all the uber geek hackers. Start tracking these cunts, digging them out, real names addresses see if we cant show them the hassle we anonymous people can cause compared to spam mail.

				I&#039;m sure this will be an unpopular suggestion, but why not require a (small) BTC donation for all new members, buyers or otherwise, on both the forums and the SR site? I&#039;m sure it would cut down on spam and would also eliminate inquiries from those not yet ready to make a purchase. <br /><br />Obviously implementing this might take a bit of work, but with luck the donations would more than cover the expense.&nbsp;
