				I made a small deposit into my SR wallet almost 2 days ago (3hrs until 2 full days). I still have not received my btc. I tripled checked the address was correct and another sr user in the &#039;is sr down&#039; thread noted his btc deposit has still not yet arrived. Is anyone else having these issues? I&#039;m aware that SR had been up and down yesterday, did this have an effect on my transaction?

				I&#039;m now at 48 hours and counting.&nbsp; I&#039;m hesitant to add any more btc to my account until I know for sure the issue has been resolved.&nbsp; Some official communication would have been nice by now.<br /><br />Between the loss in btc value and the vendors starting to raise prices to compensate for the higher SR fees, I may not even have enough to make my planned purchases.

				Same thing goes for me, I deposited just enough btc for my purchase :/<br /><br />What would cause SR to freeze deposits? Has this ever happened in the past?
