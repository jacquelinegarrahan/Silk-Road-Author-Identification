				SR suddenly started working oddly for me.<br /><br />First my ordering PIN didn&#039;t work till I re-logged in.<br /><br />Then when trying to befriend a vender it sends me to a page saying I have no access to the page..Just confused, is this happening just to me?

				I placed an order last night, the vendor accepted and it was processing.<br />The vendor has a first customer finalize earlier policy. <br />So I finalized and then an error occurred, so I refreshed and then went to my order, I was then taken straight to feedback.<br />My order is now completely gone, my feedback has appeared on the vendors profile and product page.<br /><br />Is it normal for your order to disappear once you finalize?&nbsp; how do you then update your feedback later?

				Alibi,<br /><br />Your previous transactions can be found by clicking on your account link, where your B$ balance is displayed. There you should find account links on the right side of the page that will lead you your Stats, settings, transaction, and feedback. From there you will be able to make changes.<br /><br />T4B

				In a post somewhere before it was mentioned that if SR ever did go down permanently there was a way or a process to leave a BTC address somewhere on the site and the BTC in your account would be transferred out to that address should that event occur. <br />Does anyone know how to do this, set it up?<br /><br />This is edge of the seat type stuff right now

				I&#039;m having the same experience as others.&nbsp; The logon works for a few pages, but then I&#039;m booted back off. <br /><br />I&#039;m also noticing that it won&#039;t let me get to my messages: every time I try to check messages it logs me off.&nbsp; It will let me get to my account information but also logs me out every time I try to check orders. <br /><br />Hopefully this will all get resolved soon. But for now it at least looks like we&#039;re dealing with a technical issue, not the dreaded jackboots knocking down the SR doors.
