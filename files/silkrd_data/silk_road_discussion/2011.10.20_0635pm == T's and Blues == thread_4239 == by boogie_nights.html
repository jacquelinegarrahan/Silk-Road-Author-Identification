				<br />All you old timers out there (40 and over crowd) might remember the days of T&#039;s and Blues.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s a mixture of Pentazocine and Tripelennamine.&nbsp; The &quot;T&quot; was TALWIN and the Tripelennamine tablets were blue - hence, T&#039;s and Blues....&nbsp; I guess it was quite the killer rush, comparable to Diconal, or even Dilaudid.<br />Of course, the FDA has since made all Talwin sold within the USA to have Naloxone in it, which will put any opiate-tolerant person into INSTANT withdrawals, so they made them worthless to inject.<br /><br />Anyway, a good friend of mine was saying he knows were to get Pentazocine AMPS from overseas (Naloxone-free) and pure Tripelennamine HCL.<br />If anyone is interested in him put together a few sets of them and post them for sale on SR, just leave a post and he&#039;ll see it.<br /><br />Happy sailing!

				Nah, I just couldn&#039;t take the Talwin...but your thread sure got me reminiscing about a place called Busters, where you could get a big plate of Red Beans and Rice and wash&#039;em down with a jax beer.&nbsp; New Orleans was king of T&#039;s and Blues at one time, but I had a source for the old knoll k4 dilaudids right underneath the HueyP ... maybe some will like them tho: most said the rush was like H, but I&#039;d have to pass...good luck tho -- Had me some good times with some Irish Channel raised white boys who lived in the 9th wd...a while ago tho, when the offshore oilfield boomed away :)
