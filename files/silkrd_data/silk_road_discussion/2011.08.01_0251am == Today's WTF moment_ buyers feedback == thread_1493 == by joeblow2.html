				I just signed on to the SR marketplace and in the buyers feedback box that appears on the front screen I see:<br /><br />&quot;crimson (95) 1 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;never arrived, full refund&quot;<br /><br />Are you kidding?&nbsp; I had never heard of the seller &quot;crimson&quot; before that moment but what did they possibly do in the course of giving a full fucking refund that deserved a 1 of 5???&nbsp; I&#039;d love for that buyer to come to this thread and explain their rationale.&nbsp; Who am I kidding?&nbsp; A buyer like that doesn&#039;t ever come to the forums I&#039;d bet.<br /><br />Just six lines above it I see:<br /><br />3Jane(98)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product never arrived but seller was very helpful and quickly provided a refund. Would do business with again<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Up to this moment I didn&#039;t think there was a need (at this point anyway) for a rating of buyers.&nbsp; BUT this just irked the shit out of me.&nbsp; It&#039;s like people don&#039;t understand this business or don&#039;t give a damn how they may be affecting someone else&#039;s ability to conduct business.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hey SR, I give, you need to give the sellers some way to identify buyers who will either abuse the system or simply don&#039;t understand how things work.&nbsp; Maybe a single thread on the forum that has a title like &quot;Buyers who abused me: hear sellers rant&quot;.&nbsp; At least the possibility of being outed would give a buyer pause.&nbsp; If they expected to do business at SR again, anyway.&nbsp; Ok, I&#039;m done ranting. :)<br /><br />

				A lot of buyers have no clue how hard it actually is to be a vendor and leave bad feedback unfairly. I once saw someone leave 4/5 for a handwritten shipping address, which isn&#039;t a big deal at all.

				I have been primarily a buyer here so far and I am all for buyer feedback. Ebay has feedback for both buyer and seller and that seems to have worked a little bit. I will be selling here sometime soon and would appreciate knowing up front who the scammers are. There is the possibility of losing a lot of money on bad deals and dishonest buyer &#039;resolutions.&#039; I imagine that sellers live and die by their reputation (feedback score) why should buyers not be held accountable as well? We don&#039;t necessarily have to keep an active log of what was purchased and from whom for privacy/security reasons but a simple number would be a good indicator I think.

				+1 for buyer feedback<br /><br />At them moment i have to assume everyone is a scammer trying to get free drugs. Thats sux, if a solid buyer has a complaint or issue i want to be able to respond appropriately. <br /><br />I would even give a discount to solid buyers. <br /><br />If it arrives &amp; is what they purchased it should be 5/5 then make your comments reflect your opinion of the product. <br />

				With the system as it is it&#039;s still easy to see the comments of the buyers who give bad feedback. I have no problem buying from someone with a rating a little<br />below 100 because in almost all cases it&#039;s the buyer behaving a little precious and not something the seller&#039;s done wrong.

				Jesus Christ ppl, we just all need an individual rating/rank for every single transaction.<br />It&#039;s probably a huge pain in the ass or might be simple to apply idk how to write the code and set it up but, if this is gonna be as successful as it could be a personally ranking on everyone is an improvement that is needed...IMHO!<br /><br /><br />+1 for the features request!!!!!!

				Mseller is right. if a vendor does all he can (usps delivery is totally out of the vendors hands) and you get a refund, the vendor did all that he could for the buyer. The vendor is out shipping, product and hell of a lot more time (packing it etc) than a buyer would.<br /><br />The other stuff that you mentioned is part of the game and risk. Hell, i lose a lot with the btc fluctuation on every transaction. If a vendor does all that he/she can then I would give them a 5 (if i were a buyer) and every buyer that is also a vendor would surely agree..
