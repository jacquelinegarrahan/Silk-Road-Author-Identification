				Greetings, so I&#039;ve getting close to harvest for my cubensis. Originally my plan was to trade my extra to my dealer for some LSD (a far better substance IMO) but hes left the industry (congrats to him, made it out with enough money for a house and never got caught). Being an introvert I don&#039;t feel like dealing with people in real life and I certainly can&#039;t consume all these mushrooms so I am going to become a vendor in a couple weeks. So I have a few questions:<br />1. I know for new buyers its recommended to make ~5 small purchases to get a history going, but is the same required for vendors? I expect to sell my shrooms at a discount in the beginning since I am a new vendor but I have no interest in purchasing anything here.<br />2. All the packaging advice seems to be for weed, which has a strong odor. Shrooms, as I understand it, is undetectable by dogs because they can&#039;t tell cubensis apart from some other things. How secure do I need to be in the packaging? I know we can&#039;t share any details on here because it then invalidates those strategies. I&#039;m not foolish enough to think I can just drop a bag inside a box and think its safe but the whole double-vacuum sealed bag thing seems a bit excessive (infact less bags would help me hide it better).<br />3. For cashing out, is my SR wallet &gt; bit coin fog &gt; my personal wallet &gt; any sort of currency exchange, safe? As I understand it, once I get past the bit coin fog stage I can have a normal paper trail right?<br />4. If I don&#039;t want the IRS down my back, but don&#039;t plan enough to actually launder money, how can I go about paying taxes on this money? (I&#039;m in the US)<br /><br />Thanks for your help guys, I have been lurking and absorbing information all week and I must say I can&#039;t wait!

				1. As a new vendor you&#039;re going to be under some scrutiny by buyers. What I would recommend is being very flexible on finalizing early for a start. This goes some way to alleviating fears of being scammed by a new vendor. Also, if you&#039;re willing to do so, doing cheap samples or small doses to let your product and account make a name for itself would encourage users to purchase from you and their feedback will boost your status. As a new vendor myself these are the steps I took, as well as sending out free samples and being active on the boards so I can build a level of trust with people. <br /><br />2. Odour is not much of an issue when it comes to dog detection when sending via postal services, as they generally don&#039;t have sniffer dogs positioned in Post Offices (this piece of advice I can&#039;t say as fact, I&#039;m going with what I would expect, it seems highly unlikely.). However, stealth packaging should always include as much sealing as possible, to also guarantee freshness. And try to hide it in items so it can&#039;t be felt and maybe X-ray&#039;ed (I have no idea how much stuff is X-ray&#039;ed when coming through normal post if it all...as a UK person I realize our postal service is nowhere near as Nazi as US postal). Padded envelopes help a lot in stopping stuff being &quot;felt around&quot; for.<br /><br />3. If someone pays you in an amount of coins, then you go sell this on some exchange, maybe there&#039;s a chance that whoever sent you those coins, if they&#039;re trying to trap you, is monitoring exchanges for this specific amount of coins...what I would recommend is never trade out the exact same amount of coins, either split it up or bunch them together. I can&#039;t speak for the security of coin exchanges but I personally (again, being UK, have less to fear of being the target of LEO) have very little worries of someone monitoring exchanges trying to catch me out.<br /><br />4. Not a clue, I don&#039;t know how tax returns work, but if I was to wager a guess I&#039;d say if you looked up online ecommerce tax rules (I&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty of info out there from eBay vendors) so you know how to justify your deposits. I don&#039;t know how much information you need to include with the deposit info, as in invoice wise, so this is just me guessing.<br /><br />Hope this information helps, but as I said I&#039;m UK so maybe a US vendor may be able to help you with more accuracy.

				Ok, let me correct a few things that were just poster.<br /><br />#1) New vendors can not require FE so all of it has to stay in escrow. Cheep samples and getting a few reviews from the board helps.<br /><br />#2) Dogs can not smell the difference between cubensis and any other mushroom. Seal them any way you want but make the packaging look professional.<br /><br />#3) SR has a built in mixer so they can not link a sale to a dealer, however they can link coins to SR so you may want to use something like bitfog. I would try not to leave a currency trail. There are a lot of ways to get money out of the system as cash with out leaving a trail. <br /><br />#4) Taxes? That falls into money laundering and that is something I am not even into yet.<br /><br />#4)
