				Hi,<br /><br />ok so i log into my account today and see i have a message from some1 who I sent out a FREE sample pack contaning 40 tablets to.<br /><br />the message was this - Your tracking number isn&#039;t valid. Please confirm shipement as I have left proper feedback that you might want to get sorted out. Thanks.<br /><br />so i check my feedback and see he has left me 1 out of 5 and wrote - <br /><br />Tracking number provided wasn&#039;t legit. It&#039;s been nearly two weeks and still nothing to show. Kind of expecting a knock instead of a package at this point... Will update if delivered.<br /><br /><br />So i go onto the USPS website and track his item and it says this - <br /><br />Your item was delivered at 1:07 pm on January 04, 2012 in XXXXX, XXXXX. The item was signed for by XXXXXX<br /><br />I have taken out any details so the person cannot be identified although Id love to put all his details up as I am so angry.<br />Id also like to point out tht his item was posted on the 28th of dec. I think thats a pretty good time scale since it was from India and it was the holidays.<br /><br />What can I do about this situation.<br /><br />regards/<br />Fred<br /><br />

				Hi,<br /><br />yes I have emailed him 3 times with no reply.<br /><br />At the time he left the feedback it stated on the USPS - Arrival at Post Office, January 04, 2012, 10:35 am, XXXXX, XXXX<br />so it was pretty clear that the item would be delivered today.<br /><br />What really annoys me is he claims the tracking number was not valid, come on any person with half a brain knows how to track an item.<br /><br />regards/<br />Fred

				I don&#039;t think there&#039;s really anything you can do about the feedback, the buyer is the only person who can change it. But if you&#039;re right about the tracking number then they (or someone) have obviously received the package so who knows what they&#039;re trying to achieve.&nbsp;

If this is the case, he wouldnt know the package was going to be delivered today and hence left negative feedback before the package arrived.<br /><br />Has he logged in since then? If he has, maybe since he was too dumb to figure out the tracking number, he doesn&#039;t know how to edit feedback or check his messages.

				Dont post his personal info that would only help the police and around these parts its fuck the police. <br /><br />BUT definitely post his user name so that we all know not to deal with him. I have a vendor account myself and I get scammed every now and then so any help I can have to avoid getting scammed would be very helpful.

				Hi guys,<br /><br />thx for the positive info.<br /><br />He has not read the messages yet so either he is ignoring them or maybe he has not logged in since.<br />Any way I will give another day, hopefully he gets back to me and we can sort everything out.<br /><br />regards/<br />Fred

				You should post his buyers account name only. It boils down to the simple fact that its bad business to leave 1/5 for free feedback. And fuck if your giving out samples of 40 hit me up. I will drop them bitches lol. When I do get free samples even if they arnt great I always give 5/5 I mean fuck its free. Even if I didnt receive them I would still give 4/5....its unfair to fuck with a vendors ratings for free samples. But honestly, I cant think of 1 pill I ever did that it would take 40 of to sample lol. Maybe if I was on Spring Break with 10 friends lol.

				Hushmail is about the most insecure platform for secure communications.<br /><br />They co-operate with law enforcement; in non-js sessions they can capture your passphrase and store it to later decrypt any of your emails; if you have js enabled they can send you a specific js file that captures your passphrase and sends it to them; js enabled sessions expose your real IP to Hushmail. They have admitted to doing all of the above and more in cooperation with law enforcement. They can read your emails any time they want, and so can interested law enforcement agencies.<br /><br />As far as IE goes, it is not the preferred platform for the security conscious, to say the very least.

				Hi Vj,<br /><br />thx for the info.<br /><br />I have been using cyber-rights and hushmail for the last 4 years.<br />I moved to countermail but they expire every 30 days.<br /><br />What email do you recommend ?<br /><br />regards/<br />Fred

				Sorry VJ just want to say my opinion.<br />countermail is good but you have to pay for it (use LR for that).<br />Another good option for receiving mail is privacybox (hiddend service use while on tor) where user input clear text message and its automaticly encrypted with your (previusuly instaled) public key. <br />privacybox.de (there you can find all info about how to set up account and link of hidden service, default lan is german but you can select english).<br /><br />Another service is privnote.com<br />
