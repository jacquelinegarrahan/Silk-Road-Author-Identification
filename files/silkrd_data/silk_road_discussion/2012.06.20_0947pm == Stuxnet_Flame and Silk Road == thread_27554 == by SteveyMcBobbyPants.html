				Real talk guys.<br /><br />I hope you guys have read about the US/Israel shutting down the nuclear enrichment facilities/oil terminals in Iran using computer viruses. This raises a question about Silk Road. If the US can shut down industrial facilities using nothing more than an infected flash drive, what is stopping them from shutting down an illegal marketplace that operates on a network built by the State Department? I&#039;m just having a hard time figuring out how Silk Road hasn&#039;t been shut down when the US could clearly do it if they wanted to. Thoughts?

				Lord, give me strength<br /><br /><br />The Iranian governments computer security, even in their military nuclear facilities, was simply doo doo. They were using Microsoft Windows. And they are pretty much the biggest threat to the USA and Israel, as&nbsp; rogue states go. <br /><br />The End.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				They certainly can if they wanted to. It&#039;s not very hard for them to put together a worm that attacks undisclosed vulnerabilities (0-day exploits) and spreads through email, &quot;drive by download&quot; links, etc. while remaining undetectable to antimalware solutions and even most HIPS based defenses. However, it becomes much harder when you&#039;re attacking security conscious, even paranoid individuals who use the latest software versions, don&#039;t run scripts, and don&#039;t open any correspondence from people they don&#039;t know. It would probably be easier and cheaper for them to sneak very talented undercover agents on here or just use bitch ass informants, like they did with pretty much every other underground, darknet-and-encryption-protected market or hacking crew.<br /><br />Now, if SR ever becomes a &quot;national security threat&quot;--whatever that means these days--then I would watch out for the crazy, undetectable super malware on steroids and hGH. That may very well be their silver bullet. Well, more like Platinum bullet, because these &quot;nation-state viruses&quot; cost more than many of you can imagine and, like a bullet, they can only be used once. Give it a few years though and the super government malware will become much cheaper, especially if security software and OS security keeps lagging behind the way it has been.

				A very worrying event, that stuxnet/flame bullshit.<br /><br />It shows that if you throw enough money at a team of nerds to come up with something absolutely new and with no limits, they can produce amazing/terrifying things. If SilkRoad was in their sights, I&#039;m sure there wouldn&#039;t be too much that could be prevented to stop it.<br /><br />I just hope the admins don&#039;t post any detail on how they run their servers or what their security is.
