				So this is on the Sellers Guide page now<br /><br />&quot;Bond<br />You are required to pay a bond when opening a seller&#039;s account that will be refunded to you after you have demonstrated that you are an asset to the Silk Road vendor community. To be eligible for a refund, you must have completed at least 30 transactions totaling $1,500 or more and have been a vendor for at least 6 weeks. To request a refund, send a message to vendor support after you have met these conditions. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee you will be granted a refund. All requests will be reviewed manually. &quot;<br /><br />So no one should be complaining about the price if you&#039;re going to be a reputable vendor

				And what happens if someone decides to become a vendor, but the business fails and never takes off? (I&#039;m talking about a real legitimate try, not a scam). Can you drop out and get your bond back?
