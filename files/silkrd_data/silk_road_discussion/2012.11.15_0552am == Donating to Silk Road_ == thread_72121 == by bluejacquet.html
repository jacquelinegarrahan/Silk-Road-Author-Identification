				The past week of SR downtime hasn&#039;t been much fun.&nbsp; As such, I was wondering if there is a way to donate to Silk Road, you know to keep the wheels greased?&nbsp; SR seems like a grass-roots sort of thing.&nbsp; Or does SR get a cut of each sale and can keep their servers working that way?&nbsp; Just curious, want to do my part to keep SR up-and-running.

More than enough.

				This isnt a charity.<br /><br />DPR doesnt need donations. DPR would be swimming in BTC.

				Ya, I don&#039;t think DPR &amp; Crew need it either. Although I think it&#039;s possible to donate to the mods, which I believe to be a good cause. You could also donate to a forum group like the avengers (I guess if you like LSD or puppies); they do a great service for that market, and there might be other groups chasing out scammers in other markets, which would also be a great service to the community and worth donating to. So if you just HAVE TO use those bitcoins for an altruistic purpose, you do have some options. ;)

				Thanks for the reply, guys.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep my bitcoins for my next transaction with a vendor to get me some&nbsp; ;).&nbsp; And if I meet a cool mod or group, I&#039;ll consider then.&nbsp; Happy &quot;trails&quot; everyone.
