				So, I guess you can guess that I&#039;m new to SR. I made a huge error yesterday and I&#039;ve been kicking myself ever since. I started this thread to give everyone a good laugh at my expense and to open up some discussion.<br /><br />What&#039;s the stupidest thing you&#039;ve ever done while here?<br /><br />Ok, here&#039;s mine.<br /><br />I had $13.00 in my SR account and I got paranoid. I overshot my first order and ended up having money left over. I was paranoid because I read that the bitcoins can be traced. So I transferred the coins to BitCoinFog, filled out my username and password, took a bong hit and completely forgot that shit.<br /><br />BitCoins...gone.<br /><br />Dammit.<br /><br />Anyone else fuck up as bad? I&#039;m not the only one. Right, guise?

				That&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking. I wish Google glasses came out months ago. I could rewind the tape to see what I typed in. Wait, no, that wouldn&#039;t be good.<br /><br />I&#039;m not that worried about it, but it brings up another question. How does everyone keep track of their passwords? Jebus, there are so many.

I&#039;m just now learning about PGP and TrueCrypt. I made my first buy very green, but I&#039;m satisfied with how i did it. If only I could rewind my brain to remember the username and password I entered.<br /><br />I purposely made it random, but it&#039;s so random it&#039;s gone. I try to remember it and my brain fucks with me by feeding me random usernames I could have used.<br /><br />I laugh at it and hope others do, too. With all the pressure we feel here, it&#039;s nice to get some comic relief. That&#039;s how I feel.

				i almost lost an instawallet address once that had 70 bitcoins. luckily i had made a screenshot incase i copied/pasted the instawallet URL wrong . i predicted my high mistake and it helped me bigtime! becareful to always copy/paste your instawallet URLs into notepad or something until you&#039;re done with them. i always copy/paste twice just to be safe and always verify that i can goto the URL before i close the IW tab if im leaving it sit overnight. <br /><br />

				are you talking about the fairly mild mistake of losing $13 of coins, or the massive error of doing a dull fucking drug like weed?
