				Hello, SR forum.<br /><br />This is a completely hypothetical question. I&#039;m not posting it in &quot;Product Offers&quot;, because I don&#039;t have a Seller Account and posting without a Seller Account is not allowed over there. I&#039;ve seen a lot of things posted for sale on this site - drugs, porn, grenade launchers... - but I was wondering if there would be any demand for usernames and passwords of active email accounts. Clearly, Megan Fox&#039;s email account would fetch more bitcoin than, say, some boring old guy down the street. But I was wondering how much something like that might sell for around here. How much would people pay for login information of average people?<br /><br />Purely hypothetical.

Ironic it seems.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say I did have Megan Fox&#039;s email account and password? I guess if I was selling insurance or needing specif info (most likely dirt) then I can see needing your type of&nbsp; service. <br /><br />Same hypothetical, if I wanted to read or browse through an X Spouses emails you could do that?
