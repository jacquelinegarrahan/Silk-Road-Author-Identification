				Nah, I&#039;m pretty sure what happened was that I made Indica|Sativa mad at me this time. He was trying to review peoples products on another account and I proceeded to call him stupid which lead to him posting under his admin account on accident. Which I&#039;m sure people noticed before it was deleted like myself. <br /><br />I could have just kept my mouth shut and let someone get his address by that stupid idea. Especially after he posted on his admin account. Could you imagine what LEO would have done if they got a SR admin? There would&#039;ve been a parade.
