				First Off Thanks to SR Staff, Vendors, BTC Exchangers, and MANY MANY BUYERS for ensuring that 20.4.2013 will be marked in calendars and planners worldwide. With the recent breeze of negativity, I feel we can all pick ourselves up, brush ourselves off, and appreciate that this was done the right way.&nbsp; The amount of generousity that has been extended across the forums and the site was incredible. It truly shows what a community is. From the bottom to the top. I am proud, TRULY proud to be a part of it as well. I see the best parts of capitalism at work here. Its a shame professors of Econ. at University can&#039;t demonstrate the grassroots-free market ethos at work here. Truly scintillating it is.<br /><br />My experience, I purchased flavors of weed that I have dreamed about, plenty of concentrates, and LOT and LOTS of books. A certain auto bot vendor reinvented my reading list. Couple that with some Lysergic, and I have the ingredients to medicate and expand my horizons. I want to make this clear... I plan on increasing the quality of my life based on this weekend and what it allowed me to purchase. Not just chasing a buzz. Becoming better via SR.<br /><br />&nbsp;I have witnessed this weekend as a call to action. In your life, seek out those that are like-minded, that is, can think for themselves. If those who think alike work together, the synthesis of a new market appears. The Geo-Political Forces do all they can to stamp out new markets. We have seen it before. Let us improve ourselves and our communities!<br />Let us show all those lurking in dank pits of a basement, in seething Federalist style constructed monoliths, warmed only by the heat of their servers, as there hearts are ice cold, that we are a force of positive. We are not intrinsically and enemy. Their own shrouded duty-based value set conditioning just leads them to believe this. <br /><br />What were your experiences on SR this weekend? Please share /rant<br /><br />

				I am only a buyer, not a vendor, in fact I am very vehemently NOT a dealer. I&#039;ll facilitate others having a good time, and I&#039;ll make orders for my friends with my SR account, but I will never make a dime on any of the illicit substances or activities I engage in. It&#039;s against my morals.<br /><br />Now, given the above, I loved the hell out of this weekend. I saw people helping each other on the forums, I got prompt attention from vendors I&#039;d used before and new orders, there was a real and genuine Community here. Everyone pulled together and it was a great weekend.

				I would like to see some thing done for the older sr users. I think during the 420 draw it should have been one entry for every bitcoin ever spent on SR. Then the longer you&#039;ve been here or the more you&#039;ve spent&nbsp; the more chance at being rewarded. Would be cool to have something like that. I don&#039;t see many long time users around so would like to see them acknowledged.&nbsp; Maybe one day SR can do something like that. It would reward long term users aswell as people who aren&#039;t account hopping because they keep fucking up their stats.

				Been working myself to the bone promoting a non profit organization I&#039;m trying to get off the ground so coming to the Silk Road forums has actually been pretty refreshing.<br /><br />Still trying to generate some bitcoin revenue but everyone has been really friendly so I look forward to trying the products available.<br /><br />Also trying to start up a local distribution network so I look forward to having various connections to provide my scene with the products they need :).<br /><br />Hopefully next 420 I&#039;ll be more active on the purchasing and distributing side so I can give a better account of my experience here.

				Well I didn&#039;t help any non profit organizations.&nbsp; &nbsp;I gotta make money.<br /><br />Anyway Woke up in the morning&nbsp; not at 4:20AM.&nbsp; &nbsp;I jumped out of bed.&nbsp; I grabbed a large closed cap&nbsp; Texas Strain Psilocybin Mushroom (special order from obvious).&nbsp; I washed it down with an entire&nbsp; &nbsp;Delta 11 Skunk Dew, and a glass of Jack-3d (DMAA) mixed wih CaMg fizz.<br /><br />Was high for 12+ hours.&nbsp; &nbsp; The CIA stopped by and told me to stop blowing the whistle on 9-11.&nbsp; I Saw some of my best associates and aquaintances.&nbsp; not a bad day.&nbsp; The next day 04/21/2012 I saw the CIAs big white SUV leave town.&nbsp; After they left, like clock work all my packages where delivered.<br /><br />Todays Lesson:&nbsp; Keep the truth to yourself and keep spreading MSM lies.

				I guess I was expecting bigger deals? Not to say that I didn&#039;t catch a few GREAT buys, but many listings were all &quot;~~! SALE 420 !~~&quot; for $20 grams, $60+ 1/8ths, and $300 oz. Maybe the sitewide discount didn&#039;t make as big a difference as I thought it would... I also found some of my fav vendors pretty well sold out of their goods before the sale began. With these facts in hand, I would probably have been better off just ordering before the sale to get what I had been eyeballing while waiting for the SR sale/raffle to begin and find it sold out.<br /><br />Also, why not do this sale before the holiday? Retail doesn&#039;t have big sales on christmas, they have them in the lead up to it! SR should have a &#039;get supplied for the holiday sale&#039; instead of a &#039;hop on your computer on the holiday sale.&#039; And with the turn around time it may as well end the week or weekend before just so there is a business week for shipping. How about running the sale earlier and awarding the raffle winners on the holiday?<br /><br />I&#039;m curious to hear from some vendors. Did you enjoy, or were you annoyed by, working over the holiday weekend? Or some of each maybe?<br /><br />I really like lvlbrained&#039;s idea above also.<br /><br />So, for a first go of it I&#039;d say this was fun! I found some good deals and by the volume of listings that disappeared, there were some busy vendors both before and during the weekend. The addition of gift codes at the same time was well played too. With a few adjustments I&#039;d say next year&#039;s 420 sale will be even greater!<br /><br />Thank you vendors and thanks to SR too for putting this all together!

Through SR I obtained a decently large amount of weed and shrooms and being the selectively generous person I am, I made a few friends with my liberalness with drug sharing. On 420 those friends decided to smoke me out with more weed than I&#039;ve ever smoked in one day. It truly was a magical very high holiday.

				Well I won 110 BTC so went a bit mad in the sale and snapped at lots of bargains. Even the night before the sale some vendors were selling sale price so I spent 25 BTC or so just picking up a few things in case they got snapped up!<br /><br />Got some great bargains off reputable vendors and got a few free gifts also off some. Extra dabbles of speed, some skunk, an oxycontin and other little few extra mg&#039;s over. So all is good.<br /><br />Go several things to imbibe in and am so excited!<br /><br />Cannot wait for the last 9 items to be delivered.<br /><br />Got one outstanding delay from before the sale.<br /><br />The sale was so great that I would say it is the BEST mans shopping I EVER done period.<br /><br />All we need is more counterfeit clothes and we can shop for clothes here.<br /><br />Hope SR do more comps and vendors also could stir up interest with maybe giving regular customers the odd freebie.<br /><br />The sale got me dealing with vendors I may not have dealt with. So far they have come up trumps. This is good as I can safely say most of the vendors here are legit and offer good product for the price.<br /><br />More competitions!!!&nbsp; ;D

				I think the sale brought in many new customers. It blew the doors off my little vendor business and I received more orders in two days than I had in the previous two weeks! I can&#039;t wait for the next sale!!<br /><br /><br />Some people are talking about how prices, even with the sale, still seemed high. Before I was a vendor I couldn&#039;t understand this either... it seemed that stuff should be downright inexpensive here, right? <br /><br /><br />There are a number of hidden costs that vendors have to pay that buyers might not notice... those envelopes and packaging the item comes in, the postage, the daily trips to the post office and making the rounds with local blue mailboxes, and lost mail that a good seller will just swallow and re-ship, and of course the SR commission (applicable on days other than 4/20!). Then there is a big challenge of getting Bitcoins converted back into currency to buy more inventory, that alone can eat up almost 10% when it&#039;s done very safety conscious. In all, it&#039;s expensive to be a seller! <br /><br /><br />But this is the cost of being anonymous and so much safer than buying or selling on the street somewhere! <br /><br /><br />Angelina
