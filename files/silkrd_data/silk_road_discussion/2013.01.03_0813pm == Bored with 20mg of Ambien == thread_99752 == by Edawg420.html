				They&#039;re only fun if you have a tolerance and can stay awake for the first hour after popping em.&nbsp; Then you start hallucinating and think crazy shit.&nbsp; It&#039;s fun if you can remember what you did.

				Me and Ambien started having problems when it stopped making me sleep and I stayed up on it smoking weed and hallucinating. <br /><br />If you&#039;re looking to buy, I&#039;ve got some seriously heavy hypnotic benzodiazepines, If you&#039;re &quot;bored&quot; with 20mg of Ambien, which is prety high, then I recommend temazepam or nitrazepam or possibly even zopiclone.

				I got prescribed to Ambien 10mg when I went to my doctor trying to get adderal.

				Honestly (and this is only speaking from personal experience), Ambien would not be the best Rx to take when faced with an afternoon to kill and a healthy dose of boredom.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always found Ambien to be trippy, yes, but somewhat lackluster in terms of enjoyment, especially during the day.&nbsp; Keep in mind that I base this conclusion upon the fact that the effects from Ambien would not be enjoyable for me given the situation you would be taking it: in the daytime, bored.&nbsp; Ambien, or rather its effects, are much more enjoyable to me late at night when I want to relax and remain minimally active; even more appealing to me is when I can use that Ambien in tandem with another Rx or to ease my comedown from a long night of neurotransmittorial-stimulation.&nbsp; Smoke a bowl.&nbsp; Take some opiates.&nbsp; These things make that boredom work for you.&nbsp; You won&#039;t be sitting there all day, slightly debilitated by a lack of anything to do or the ability to think of something.&nbsp; Just my two cents.

				I abused the fuck outta Ambien. I really shouldn&#039;t have considering I actual do have some problems with sleeping. I&#039;m not sure when it happened, but Ambien doesn&#039;t do SHIT to me anymore. It just makes me space out and be quiet, and this is on like 3 or 4 10mg pills. The most I&#039;ve taken in one sitting is about 10. I was in an Ambien hole, luckily I had my friends there watching me.

				Personally I think you&#039;re going to fall asleep or eat a bunch of food or do something retarded but to each his own. If you start hallucinating go to bed. It&#039;s a really weird sort of trip that is borderline unpleasant.

				Armed with a script for Ambien I used to take it a lot to knock my ass out after work so I wouldn&#039;t go out drinking. Unfortunately a few times when I stayed up dicking around on Twitter and FB I ended up bar hopping and remember NOTHING of it. I even managed to bed a few chicks and wake up with them the next day wondering what the fuck had happened. <br /><br />Fastforward to now, I am married and since my wife got preggo I stopped taking it because I was worried I&#039;d have to take care of my kid or her for some sort of emergency. The last time I took it, she woke me up at some point, I started having sex with her and -wham- shoved my junk in her butt w/o warning. I was a butt rapist now! I felt soooooo bad for a long time.<br /><br />So while it was fun, I def don&#039;t need any more war stories about Ambien.

				I took like 10-20mg of Ambien with a friend and stayed up smoking bowls all night. All I can remember of those 12 hours is about 10 minutes of me driving down the block smacking rows of cars with my side mirror.

I really shouldn&#039;t have considering I actual do have some problems with sleeping. I&#039;m not sure when it happened, but Ambien doesn&#039;t do SHIT to me anymore. It just makes me space out and be quiet, and this is on like 3 or 4 10mg pills. The most I&#039;ve taken in one sitting is about 10. I was in an Ambien hole, luckily I had my friends there watching me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you managed to somehow abuse Ambien like that, please never touch temazepam or midazolam or anything like that. Jesus.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve never heard of those until now.<br /><br />Thanks mang.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;::)<br /><br />Anyway OP is definitely asleep or eating pop-tart sandwiches right now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />LMFAO...poptart sandwiches.&nbsp; Ambien always makes me eat the strangest foods, and since I am a girl I always decide to give myself a makeup makeover...I always wake up looking pretty hilarious, like a hooker who had a stroke or something.
