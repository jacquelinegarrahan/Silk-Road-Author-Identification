				Hi, could anyone explain how the purchasing stats work? I&#039;ve made nearly 20 purchases with only 1 refund, but my stats give me a 26% refund rate. WTF?<br />I&#039;ve messaged SR but he&#039;ll probably take a couple of days so I though I&#039;d ask if anyone can explain that. Or has anyone had the same problem.

				Thanks gainslayer.<br />That&#039;s a bit shit though, I make 17&nbsp; medium orders that all go great, then I make a large order that doesn&#039;t come through, get a 75% refund and my stats are fucked!&nbsp; Why the hell is it based on value of order and not number of refunds?&nbsp; Seems a bit arsed about to me.

				Damn, you&#039;re lucky Kali. I&#039;m being refused escrow from vendors because of ONE refund!<br />That is so fucked because I won&#039;t deal OOE. Is it going to get to the point where buyers are scared to ask for a refund because they&#039;re so worried about their stats?<br />I think it&#039;s time to leave SR, the level of paranoia and mistrust at the moment is extreme. Damn shame, this place used to be great:( <br />And good weed is so hard to find in the UK as well.

				Everyone is paranoid because SR isnt doing much to stop scammers. I am new but I have also thought about the fact that in some cases I would rather just not ask for a refund, like if the order was small, because it would ruin my ratings. To bad SR doesnt care about stopping scammers lol. But then again can we blame him? He is making money hand over fist from scammers and in all honesty most transactions are legit
