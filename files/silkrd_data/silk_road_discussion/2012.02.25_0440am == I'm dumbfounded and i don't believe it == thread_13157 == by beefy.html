				Seriously, i think this whole thing is run by the d e a or something. i still can&#039;t believe i&#039;m able to (if i wanted) buy diesel or e, let alone valium. I still don&#039;t believe it. I found about the tor service today after being on the net since 1998 and i really think it&#039;s the hope for the future considering all these laws they are trying to pass. But i really hope anon busts those kiddie pr0n sites. that is sick. but as far as me choosing to take a pill to feel relaxed. that decision should be up to me and no one else.<br />But anyways, are there many people in the us. i&#039;m really itching to try this service out, but i&#039;m scared.

				Take your time in the forums, identify the trusted members and the moderators posts as often as you can, if you are an intelligent human being you should be able to sort through some of the BS and draw conclusions on risk vs reward, who the reputable vendors are and the quality of products. and remember there is no such thing as a stupid question, just stupid people who ask questions so lead with your head and always reference info already available in forums before you play yourself. Anyway I was sitting right where you were a month a go but now here I am 7 successful transactions later and I am sold. Good luck my friend. 8)

				Welcome to the road. I like to compare this site to going off the high dive when you were a kid the first time. You would see people doing it all the time, but never really thought of it. Until the day came that you climbed up those stairs, and stood on the edge. Damn, it seems really high from here. You don&#039;t know if you can do it. You have butterflies in your stomach. But you take the plunge anyway. It was fun, exhilerating almost. You realize that after that first jump, it gets easier, and easier, and you think about it less and less, until it&#039;s second nature really. That&#039;s the road in a nutshell. Break the ice, follow the rules, protect yourself, be smart, and you&#039;ll have a good experience here. I&#039;m still new to buying, and learning, but I know we definitely have something great here.<br /><br />I&#039;d say a majority of the buyers here are from the US. Take the steps posted on the forums to keep yourself safe. Use PGP. Take precautions, but don&#039;t give in to paranoia. There&#039;s no need.&nbsp; 8)

				Because I gave this seller (vortexmilkman(98)) a low rating (which was explained in the subject line) I have received these series of threatening messages:<br />1) &quot;So you&#039;re not going to change it or reply? OK, we&#039;ll see what other goodies you receive in your mail&quot;<br />2) &quot;Was nice knowing you.&quot;<br />3) &quot;You&#039;re in a small little town in the middle of nowhere, Im sure the Post office and or local Police will have fun knowing your address at xxx Robinson St is a center of Drug activity.<br />Keep fucking playing with me.&quot;<br /><br />This is unacceptable; what&#039;s the point of a rating system if I can&#039;t be honest, and then this coward threatens me with the police?<br />I will not deal with a jack-ass like this again, and his text responses show that my rating was spot-on!

				omg, i almost just cried. i left the main page to come to the forum and register. then i tried going back to the main page, but i wasn&#039;t able to log in. and i was trying everywhich way to log in and i couldn&#039;t. and then i went to see that it was because i had turned off my cookies. i guess the site won&#039;t work without having cookies on. i guess i&#039;ll just use ccleaner later. :) so yeah, the prices seem very fair. idk if i should say what i fancy, but i love benzz and EvolvE.&nbsp; ;D

				I kind of just saw something that saddened me in a search. Gawker and wired have done a piece on SR. Which makes me think, how long will it last? I hope I&#039;m just being paranoid.

				Buying drugs online is nothing new. This is just the current most streamlined attempt-<br /><br />-basic anonymity<br />-eBay style listings<br />-currency with escrow<br />-forum for discussing vendors<br /><br />The system isn&#039;t perfect (and based on the nature of this business, probably never will be) but it&#039;s a hell of an improvement over, say, doing shady dealings over instant messaging.

				Just getting started myself... Feels kind of like the Matrix tho.&nbsp; You hear whispers of it from trusted sources, you hear rumors from sketchy sources.&nbsp; But you really have to follow the rabbit hole yourself to see.&nbsp; Everything has added up thus far, the good, and the bad create the whole experience.&nbsp; If it were 100% safe then it couldn&#039;t be real.&nbsp; But you are the only one that can decide your level of risk vs reward.&nbsp; I&#039;m moving slow.&nbsp; This first post is nowhere near my first visit.&nbsp; Just easing onto the road from the wilderness so to speak.&nbsp; Safe travels and good luck.
