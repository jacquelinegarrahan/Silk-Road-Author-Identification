				Hi all–<br /><br />I&#039;m currently in two situations valued at $130 escrow that I&#039;m not sure what the best way to deal with is. I&#039;m curious what your advice would be.<br /><br />&nbsp;??? Situation #1:<br />I ordered some LSD candies at the beginning of March (the fourth) and they still haven&#039;t arrived. Earlier, auto-finalize almost happened but I filed a one week extension request and the seller agreed to it. However, the candies still aren&#039;t here and there are four days until auto-finalization. I filed another one-week extension request, but went to the sellers profile and noticed that they&#039;re going to be on vacation longer than the due date for a response to the request. This is a 99% positive vendor with over 300 transactions, but they don&#039;t have any sort of refund policy listed. Should I file for a refund? What would be a fair percent to request? In your experience, how do the Silk Road admins generally rule when they have to look at a claim?<br />This happened to me once before with Ecstasy pills, but the seller had a 75% refund policy which I agreed to take. Unfortunately that was two separate orders for both a friend and I, so my account was doubly hit with the failed deliveries.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-\ Situation #2:<br />I ordered DMT for both myself and a friend, which took quite a while to arrive but did for me. Friend&#039;s still waiting on his. Before either order arrived I filed a time extension claim, so there are 9 days left before auto-finalization / an SR admin stepping in.<br />I vaporized the DMT- and it didn&#039;t work. I have a thread about it here- dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=139218.0<br />Posts in that thread are leading me to believe the DMT is fake. Whether that was done purposefully by the seller or not I do not know, but I am confused as the seller has 99% positive reviews (though non mention the products&#039; quality). I&#039;m going to wait for my friend to try his, as he is not on any medication period- though I&#039;ve personally taken LSD on my meds with no issues, and no, I hadn&#039;t recently tripped before vaporizing the DMT as stated in the thread.<br />If his DMT doesn&#039;t work and it&#039;s decided that the product is fake- what should I file? 100% refund, or a lesser percentage? The seller also does not list any refund values except for snatched packages.<br /><br />Thanks again for your advice and sharing your own personal experiences! The great thing about SR is that these scenarios can be dealt with formally rather than having your dealer threatening to hurt you when he sold you pot with PCP ¬_¬<br />

				I&#039;ve got no idea where this thread is in the discussion board (can&#039;t find it) so I presume it&#039;s buried deep. Is it evil if I bump it?

				Let me see if I have this right. You have 4 orders 3 are a no show and the forth is bunk? <br /><br />Well if this is all true then you will prob get a refund on the 3 orders left in dispute. Perhaps you should hold off on making any more orders till you figure out what you are doing because you must be doing something wrong.

				I apologize, I&#039;m not really interested in reading your thread but I love the sound of my own keys clicking away, so I&#039;ll type you up a little bit of info that&#039;s hopefully helpful. ;) <br /><br />Recourse for orders that do not meet your expectations, in the order you should use them:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Contact the vendor through SR and work something out.<br />2.&nbsp; Click &quot;Resolve.&quot; If you&#039;re reputation is great, you may want to consider letting an order go, however.<br />3.&nbsp; Go to the forums and post about your experience in the rumor mill.<br /><br />Throughout all of this it is important to be completely honest and take the high road.&nbsp; If your story has the slightest hole you&#039;re fucked.&nbsp; Plead you case and be patient.&nbsp; <br /><br />Option 3 is a last resort, vendors do not like being called scammers on the forums and usually take it seriously.&nbsp; Do not post an angry rant, there is no use in being angry or making threats while on Tor, it just makes you look pathetic. :P <br /><br />Good luck,<br />lelmeriodici

				If the vendors are new, have very few transactions, or little feedback on the forums, I would say you got scammed.<br /><br />Post the names of the vendors at your discretion, we&#039;ll tell you what we think of them.&nbsp; I&#039;ll bet the vacation vendor is a total scam and that it&#039;s obvious.<br /><br />lelmeriodici

				O ok so than 2 of of the orders in question are from the same vendor now that makes a little more sense anyway.<br /><br />The one where the vendor is on vacation you could ask for more time if you want to try and resolve the dispute with the vendor.<br /><br />The one that is bunk you should be able to get your money back on. <br />If what you got was bunk than I am guessing that the stuff sent to your friend will be no good too.<br /><br />For the lost orders did you use a good address? If you used a sketchy address than that is not the vendors fault. But, if the vendor never sent anything it doesn&#039;t matter and you should get a %100 refund. <br /><br />I know one vendor is on vacation but have you talked to the other one and explained your problems. He/she might be willing to help you. You also might want to search the vendors name in the forum because if he/she is mailing out fake stuff other people&nbsp; will be complaining about it. <br /><br />If you can&#039;t work out a solution with the vendors than you only have 2 options 1) take it to resolutions or 2) eat the loss. <br /><br />If everything you described is accurate than you should get most of your coins back. <br /><br />Whatever you decide, you should reflect your experience in their feedback so other buyers know to use caution when dealing with them.

				1. Extend time before it goes into auto finalization.<br />2. Talk to the vendors, send them messages, sometimes i have problems with orders , people make honest mistakes we re all humans, some vendors have sometimes over 50 orders a day, and they are not robots, they can fuck up too. <br />3. If they ignore you, or tell you to fuck off, or they give you no refund at all, go to the resolution center.<br /><br />4. Whose dmt was it? name of the vendor? I have bought dmt from almost every vendor on the road that sells it.

				Alright. So the friend&#039;s DMT arrived... worked for him. Guess I might as well finalize both since the orders arrived and it worked for him. Sucks that mine didn&#039;t work but I doubt the seller would be jiffing only half of us- maybe I have too much faith in people.<br /><br />Regarding the LSD, though– Vendor&#039;s 99.3% positive, 300+ transacs. Currently on vacation. I&#039;ve filed an extension but it&#039;ll go to admin decision before the vendor comes back. Should I file a refund as well? I don&#039;t know what&#039;s a fair percentage as I don&#039;t want to jiff an honest seller- but I also don&#039;t want a liar getting any of my money. The address I had it shipped to isn&#039;t shady, is owned by me and has received plenty of LSD in the past.
