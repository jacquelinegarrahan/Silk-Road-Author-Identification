				I know of at least one well reviewed SR US domestic vendor who is selling there...<br /><br />I don&#039;t like how the site automatically PGP encrypts the buyer&#039;s address for them. At the most it should be an optional feature, not required. I would recommend messaging the vendor with your PGP encrypted address separately from the order form.

				I gave it a looksee too, and I pretty much agree. A huge portion of the listings are either: obvious scams, or from vendors with little to no credibility. The few I&#039;m confident enough to call legit are typically overseas in high risk countries. Just not very worth it for me right now. I might take a shot if SR stays down the rest of the week.<br /><br />BMR could definitely shape up to compete with SR. They just don&#039;t have the kind of stuff SR has in place for its community. They don&#039;t even have much of a community. Maybe with the &quot;exodus&quot; going on (I seriously have not seen more than two vendors make the jump) BMR will gain the community it needs to shapen up.<br /><br /><br />I hope so, competition would be nice.

				I did a small order from a well known vendor. More out of interest (or boredom) than anything else. The vendor in question is very good on Silk Road and so I thought it worth a punt to see if it really is who they say they are. I&#039;ll know from the packaging if they are. If so then I&#039;ll report back on how it goes. <br /><br />if this works then whilst MBR may be smaller, it is actually up and running.

				I wouldn&#039;t buy at all from anyone not from SR or without feedback. <br /><br />It would be nice to see more Canadian vendors from SR on there but I&#039;m not inpatient.

				i sell on BMR and SR, under UKmaryjane on BMR, i registered accounts on both SR and BMR at the same time, traffic on BMR is pretty much non-existent, I have made 1 sale on there and after a quiet time went into vacation mode, coming out of it when SR went down in case any SR buyers headed that way.<br /><br />So here is the thing, BMR is pretty much like SR when it comes to drugs, yes there are other services and products on there and they may or may not be scams, not all will be and checking feedback is pretty effective way to not get scammed especially after they changed the way feedback was given so that small sales no longer count to feedback, so feedback could not be padded. The escrow service is just the same as on SR. Whoever said they would prefer to have an out of escrow deal on these forums over an escrow deal on BMR is an idiot looking to get scammed.<br /><br />For vendors on the site the costs are low compared to SR and you dont have to buy the account so that can help. It certainly has a niche or two, if i had to identify one it does look like it is widely used in finland to buy weed. the largest weed seller, or the one with the most feedback, is finnish domestic only.<br /><br />If you want to try it out, try it out, dont listen to naysayers on these forums. They talk as if scamming is non existent on SR and if you have spent any time on these forums you will know that is not true. Even today scammers are active, BTC/Moneypak is currently the worst it seems, but there is still the traditional retirement scam from long term vendors. So take the same care as you would with an order from SR, avoid negative feedback vendors, check the feedback, stay in escrow, check the last time the vendor logged in before you think of placing an order and check the forums.<br /><br />thats it, stay safe

				I checked out bmr too when I 1st found silkroad but out of 3 transactions I only received 1 and got a refund for 1 of them. BMR has 2 big issues the feedback system doesn&#039;t seem to be effective at all there are loads of vendors who have been around for a while with little or no feedback so its hard to tell who to trust. Also their forum is great and not as in depth as SR forum, this might change if they got more traffic. As someone said previously if they had more traffic, they would have more resources to improve the whole site and forum.

				UKMJ,<br />I wasn&#039;t trying to discourage anyone from trying BMR, just giving my impressions.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t find reliable feedback for anyone domestic.&nbsp; If anyone has US domestic vendors on BMR that are reliable, please let me know.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to do something in the downtime.&nbsp; Plus - if their site begins gaining traction, we will have two viable choices.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wish there were 3 or 4 &quot;SR&#039;s&quot; out there for consumers to choose from.&nbsp; It would not only keep prices down, but would prevent downtime as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Trust me - I love SR, but the more options the better.&nbsp; At this time, I don&#039;t think BMR is a viable option for my needs, but if you live in other countries it could be a wonderful option.&nbsp;

				As time goes on vendors, and buyers will have no choice. You should at least take a look. ::)<br />If you thought SR was full of scams, well enter into a new world my friends. ;D<br />Hopefully a few good vendors move over to hedge their bets, and we will follow. It&#039;s got to be getting hard for the coke, H, and pill users. :-[<br />I have looked at BMR, it needs organization. If it&#039;s not reliable, we need to make it reliable. Hopefully we all learned a lesson about putting all your eggs/BTC in one basket. I understand things can happen. This proves a need for a second system. The problem with that, is it could be a security problem. So be careful!<br /><br />Time to move forward. BMR isn&#039;t second, if it&#039;s the only game in town;)<br />

				Just had another look . Looked earlier in the year and it looks better than it did but its clearly miles behind SR. Looking at cocaine vendors and they all look like scams , hard to work out whos legit. Forums are too empty aswel. Theres one vendor called &#039;theseedbank&#039; his feedback score is 76 ( number of feedback comments i think) the next highest is about 7 lol. I prefer SR but tempted to vend over their aswel, mayb fill the empty space for a decent cola dealer? I guess it takes established vendors on here to go over there and make a name for themselves

				I checked out BMR last week after a fellow TOR user showed me the site over coffee. He said he prefers it but on my own I could not see why other than lower traffic makes the servers less likely to take a dump. Lack of a real forum like this is no good for me. I am here because often the things I like are very impure on the street and here I can get good info usually on vendors and product. Things I would expect in a prohibition free market you know? Safety first because life is too precious to risk taking poison that is supposed to be MDMA etc...<br /><br />I for one will wait this out and see. I like what gut says about DPR, his philosophy and reason for being here. Liberty

				Curiousity and a rapidly dwindling pharmaceutical supply sent me to BMR as well but most of the vendors are from major flag countries for my location and not enough vendor feedback to give me confidence to take the plunge...

				I tried it out through boredom as SR was down. I did the smallest transaction I could with somebody who claimed to be on SR. It was a scam. I&#039;m down a few bitcoins, but hey ho, thats life.<br /><br />Personally speaking I wouldn&#039;t bother. The number of transactions are low, it&#039;s too easy to scam and its a mine field. I&#039;d trust absolutely no one.<br /><br />For all the SR vendors who are looking at using BMR you need a mechanism to show that you are who you say you are on Silk Road. The only thing I can think of is PGP signatures, which means that we MUST start to use them. Other people may have better ideas.<br /><br />Since Silk Road appears to have some pretty bad reliability problems at the moment, an alternative that&#039;s reliable is a good investment. <br /><br />I&#039;d love to have the time to build a replacement to SR but its just too much hassle.
