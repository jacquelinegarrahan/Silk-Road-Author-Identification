				Well I had a good run on Silk Road and want to thank everyone who helped me when I needed it.<br /><br />My official page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6472cf4325<br /><br />I accumulated &#039;A LOT&#039; of Bitcoins during my vendor days and instead of being a money grubbing capitalist.<br />I have decided to sell all the rest of my coins at a FLAT RATE of $18 each.<br /><br />I will only be accepting Moneypaks only as a form of payment.<br /><br />This is a first come first serve... soon as all the coins are sold I will delete this posting.<br /><br />Thanks to SR and DPR format for making this all possible.<br /><br />Love you all,<br />TJ<br /><br />*Msg me through the Sild Road Forums, thanks you

				First of all, it&#039;s always sad to see a good vendor go, and you shall be missed. Second of all, how would you plan on carrying out this transaction? Would you send first or expect the buyer to send first?

				Isn&#039;t everyone always sceptical about buying BTC with moneypak over here? Like Jezuz said, vendors aren&#039;t at their computers 24/7 and we all know how slow tor is. Enjoy yourself Trustus ;)

				I should have chimed in when I reported this to the mods a few days ago.<br />(Where the fuck are they when actual important shit happens?)<br /><br />This is just a horrendously bad idea and has scam written all over.<br /><br />What, exactly, would motivate a vendor who is leaving the game and burning his old identity to honor this deal after he receives the mp codes? Nothing at all. This sounds (and I hope I&#039;m wrong, but it has all the hallmarks) like a Tony76-style burn.<br /><br />And his story is bullshit you can&#039;t run a vendor operation without cashing out bitcoins all along the way (there&#039;s inventory to buy, after all). So it&#039;s not like every bitcoin he ever made has been hoarded and now he wants to sell them for a THIRTY PERCENT discount? GTFO.<br /><br />

				So.. the vendor has 90% on their money already.<br /><br />They&#039;re offering to sell them for 75%..<br /><br />They would already have a well established &quot;withdraw&quot; trail, since they&#039;ve been a vendor.<br /><br />You idiots send him free money...<br /><br />He takes your money, cashes out the BTC (if he had any).. and that&#039;s that. He makes 110% and is done here anyways.

				MagicMan is kind of right....I feel like far more vendors go out by just taking in tons of orders and either FE&#039;ing &#039;tough countries&quot; or knowing that they&#039;ll get 50% and then bounce. Vendors that I can remember &quot;retiring&#039; or shutting down since I came on here:<br /><br />1. Starr (sp?) - took the money<br />2. Tony76 - took the money<br />3. Rocker - didn&#039;t take it, but made probably a shitload off of his sales at the end, considered the rise from $5 to $22ish when he cashed out<br />4. SuperTrips - took the money<br />5. Ivory (could be wrong, but was under impression they had basically vanished for a while, then popped back up and everyone just forgot about the nissing. <br />6. Phfelinder - took the tmoney<br /><br />There are more I&#039;m sure, but - as moral as I am, I can absolutely see why, when you&#039;re sitting pretty and maybe finally out of stock, sitting on 5000, 10000btc, and have the choice of going through the hassle of one last final sale or just getting 2500 on your way out and really having at most maybe a few people know about it. <br /><br />The average lifespan of a vendor here is 3 months (per arxiv study on the marketplace). I don&#039;t know about that Trustus Jones guy, but if you&#039;re going to sell your BTC, there really isn&#039;t a good way to sell them in large amounts without major risk or getting way less than their &quot;worth&quot; right now. I mean, I just checked BTC Charts and they&#039;re at fucking $27?<br /><br />My first BTC buy (back when BitInstant was being used cleverly as an affiliate program by a handful of vendors, $6 including fees was a pretty banging deal. So using Trustus Jones as an example - if he took in the most BTF at an average $10-12, selling them for $18 for MoneyPaks (which should be able to be cashed out relatively fast) is not a bad option (vs. grinding out trades at $22, $23 or whatever it&#039;s really worth). <br /><br />BTC reminds me of my friends who collect cards/comics/etc - they&#039;ll get something and say &quot;dude it&#039;s worth like $1500&quot; and my response is &quot;it&#039;s not worth anything until somebody has $1500 for you....if you have no buyers, it&#039;s worth nothing as of now.&quot;<br /><br />Interesting to see how this whole hack/&quot;bug fix&quot; goes down. By far the last stray for me - I just don&#039;t think that DPR team has the staff and resources to beat the interested Russian and Chinese who already take billions from Google and other US companies. The US/UK are far from being in control of the internet these days....the Chinese (often funded by the Russian gangs) have it on lock really. <br /><br />It&#039;s just&nbsp; matter of time before the internet becomes a place that isnt a sort of a wild-west with every other government saying &quot;hey how about taking lead on the who internet police (or sheriff) role,: I&#039;m prepared for the worst .

				What hack are you talking about?&nbsp; There hasn&#039;t been a hack, as far as I&#039;m aware.&nbsp; There was a system glitch earlier this evening where bitcoin deposits were showing up over and over again, but that was just a code issue and has been fixed (so SR should be back up and running on a rolling basis).&nbsp;
