				It&#039;s good to know how good the seller / packaging is but the quality of the drug is the most important thing when buying IMO.<br /><br />(It can be modified by going to Account then picking View feedback on the right)

				I personally wouldn&#039;t leave negative feedback based on the quality of the product due to the fact that I have given my name and address to them. I am not saying I am scared of leaving negative feedback, of course there are certain instances where I would. If you want to know about the quality of a product it is best to check on the forums, I see where you are trying to go with this and it would be very helpful if more people would give their reviews.

				To me, the number rating rates the security, packaging and shipping time.<br />The text review you write should rate the quality of the product. <br />

				Well for pharmaceuticals, there really is no need. In the off chance that they are fake, it will be represented in the feedback. Like &quot;weak benzo, freakin&#039; sugar pill.&quot;<br /><br />For weed and psychedelics, it&#039;s too subjective an experience to leave information about quality in feedback. Those require reviews which detail environment, amount taken, method of administration, etc. <br /><br />For things like Cocaine, Meth, and Heroine... past quality is not necessarily indicative of future quality. They also deserve review threads. Though a note in feedback like &quot;wasn&#039;t as potent as advertized&quot; or &quot;was exactly as described&quot; would give an indication of a trend of quality. But really, even here, the method of administration can have vastly different results due to the variation in bio-availability per method of administration. So a review thread would better serve in these instances also. <br /><br />Your idea sounds good on paper but if implemented may do more harm than good.

				There needs to be a system like e-bay: either positive or negative feedback only. Then there would be various &#039;subcategories&#039; which can be rated X/5, such as shipping, packaging, product quality/expectation (...relative to the description, i.e. paying for what you get; this is where vendor honesty is important), vendor support/customer service, etc.
