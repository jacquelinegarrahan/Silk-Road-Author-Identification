				I can&#039;t find where i read it but, if you lose your pin message SR support telling them so and within a week they will allow you to reset it.<br />You could just make a new account and order from that and once the week is over you could send the funds to your new account.<br />As far as I know it is not lost if you have your password and can message SR from the account that you don&#039;t know the pin of.

				Pin is a second password on your account to do anything involving your btcs.<br />You should have set it up at the same time you joined the website as a member.
