Though I think you should remove the Caps also...and you should re-read the message they sent you.. They could not have been more clear and even told you sorry in advance if this is there mistake and by your reaction I assume it is. And they said if you have a problem...respond to the message. And&nbsp; did you do that?<br /><br />You do realize the Mods in the forums&nbsp; absolutely can not do a single thing for you? And there will be no duper power or protest as this is no big deal and since you didn&#039;t do anything wrong it should be fixed fast. Also look at the bright side...you do not have to return messages today...and tomorrow is Sunday and no mail so you got lucky in this is not a Monday and tomorrow is not Tuesday. So that is a good break ;) <br /><br />Also when you calm down as I am sure your upset and not knowing what even caused this is of course bothersome....know that this is the stuff they have to do to keep the buyers safe. And it is best you are cool and understanding ...Sorry this happened to you...

				I&#039;m glad SR is being tough on vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;They need to be like ninjas and better than average behind the computer chair.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just got a MSG from a vendor saying they want to resolve a neg feedback I made over a month ago. He said he&#039;d send a reship shortly.&nbsp; Funny thing is that I never gave any address to him for this.&nbsp; He still has my original address from over a month ago, which means it has been pasted into a document somewhere.&nbsp; Jeese.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t send me anything and just fucking delete my address please, pretty please. <br /><br />I found out later that he forwarded my order to another vendor who is not domestic and from a high profile country. It got seized with my name and address on it.&nbsp; Fuck! Thanks.&nbsp; I never order across seas, as if he did this.&nbsp; Then made me dispute it in resolutions and lost half my money. <br /><br />So yea, there is a lot of weak vendors that are putting buyers at risk.&nbsp; Misleading

What about the close to 10 other vendors this happened to in the same few days.... also said no way it was being fished. Quite fucking blaming me and take responsibility. I d not get fished you guys fucked up on your end on mine. Sick of all the mods trying to save SR&#039;s rep by lying. You accuse me of putting my customers at risk when I did not get fished and no keylogger. So what SR guilty before proven innocent?

				I need to add nothing to scout&#039;s post apart from one rebuttal to one of your points:<br /><br />Out of the 5 vendors that had their accounts compromised in the same week as you, 1 of them admitted that they definitely entered their details into a phishing site, and another admitted that it was &#039;highly likely&#039; that they entered their details into a phishing site.<br /><br />That leaves 3 vendors, all of whom are relatively new and seemingly inexperienced, who swear there&#039;s no chance they allowed their information to be compromised and that &quot;SR fucked up&quot;. No large / experienced vendors were compromised over the two weeks that we see people getting phished, apart from albionessentialols - and funnily enough, he readily admitted that he was phished and accidentally gave his credentials away by logging in at the incorrect URL.<br /><br />If &quot;SR fucked up&quot; then everyone&#039;s accounts would have been compromised; as you can plainly see, that is not the case.

An attacker doesn&#039;t need physical access to your computer, they can infect it when you simply visit a malicious web site, for example.<br /><br />It&#039;s a good reason to use Tails, especially if you are a vendor. 99% of malware is made for Windows, but even if there was some malware for Linux (which I&#039;m not aware of any existing in the wild at the moment), your system would be wiped clean on the next reboot.<br />

No what I&#039;m saying is that 3 weeks prior to this happening I changed my pass phrase to another strong one. I may have entered it wrong 50 times or more and maybe thats why I couldn&#039;t gain access. Because I was not fished or had a key logger. I have top security linux and MAC knowledge. So that didn&#039;t happen. So maybe yes I entered it wrong I can accept that rather than blame SR, although a few other vendors it happened to around the same days. One yes admitted he was fished. I was not. So why kick me off when maybe ok I can apologize and accept maybe I entered a pass phrase over 50 times wrong that was 3 weeks old. <br /><br />I at no point was a danger to my customers and that&#039;s why I&#039;m being kicked off because SR staff wants to say I was fished, which i wasn&#039;t, or had a key logger, which i wasn&#039;t I have top security knowledge and been buying on SR over a year and a half. I had a 100% vendor rating with over 150 transactions. I&#039;m not trying to sell my LSD without an account but I&#039;m sure I will get it back because I did nothing to jeopardize my customers

				The bottom line is that they locked the account for the protection of your customers AND you since you initially claimed that someone hacked your account.&nbsp; It is remaining locked while they complete an investigation.&nbsp; If you did nothing wrong, then you have nothing to worry about, and you have NOT been &quot;kicked off&quot; -- it&#039;s just under review and, as we keep mentioning, will in all likelihood be reopened after the investigation.

				I find it amusing when vendors never have a forum presence at all, then cry out for help, your likely not going to get it...
