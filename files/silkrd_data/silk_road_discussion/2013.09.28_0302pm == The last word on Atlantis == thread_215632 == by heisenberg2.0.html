				From Atlantis blog.org/ *Clearnet <br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />So one week has passed since I announced the imminent closure of Atlantis and now here I am writing from the last remains of the sunken kingdom, I had high hopes they could go out with dignity but it&#039;s with a heavy heart I now have to write it&#039;s obvious Atlantis has sunk to the lowest depths of the darknet.....That of the scam artist.<br /><br />They say the greatest scam is the one you don&#039;t see coming and after advising many Atlantis users on how to avoid being scammed I didn&#039;t want to believe I was a victim of the long scam myself.<br /><br />My motives now and in past are still first and foremost to get involved wherever I can to help break prohibition and nullify the so called war on drugs while secondly carving out a path for myself in life that I truly believe in.<br />The last few months have been very hectic but I now know what it means when people say they found their calling, The sense of satisfaction I got from being on the front lines in the war on drugs was enough to hook me. I went from a freelance Tech/Social media gun for hire who&#039;s only darknet experience was reading the articles that came out in Gawker and other media about a year ago to absorbing every single thread of information on the Silk Road forums in as little time possible.<br />Of course I didn&#039;t learn everything fast enough as &quot;Astor&quot; and other forum members pointed out on a few occasions but in three months I went from just about knowing PGP and that it&#039;s a good idea to utilize a VPN over TOR to knowing real security means physical isolation and never saying what exact security measures you use besides &quot;all of it&quot;.<br /><br />Unfortunately I think it was similar case for Admin at Atlantis, While they knew what they were getting into and were quite adept, A lot of security holes have been found in TOR of late along with a few supercomputer purchases potentially capable of breaking the RSA 1024/2048 encryption used to run the TOR network and other &quot;uncrackable&quot; encryption methods.<br />The Atlantis admin were very level headed guys and I firmly believe closure was a case of the con&#039;s started outweighing the pros at a time where it wasn&#039;t too late to get out, destroy any evidence and move on with a semi-clean slate. My guess is they went from having 100% faith in the technology to recently realizing it&#039;s not foolproof nor future-proof and like DPR said in his post on Atlantis closing &quot;the fear&quot; is something everybody has to deal with and make peace with by themselves and for that 99.9% assurance in your security is never enough unless you are willing to face the heat if that 0.01% comes up some day.<br /><br />I think claims the site was unprofitable are far from true and on the contrary if the plan was always to close shop when the piggy bank was full then now was the time, While I don&#039;t have sales figures the traffic to all the social media pages was at an all time high and I believe money was rolling in faster than ever and I was hearing reports of support response times being slower than ever.<br /><br />The below screenshot shows the rate we were picking up fans on social media, (Note the huge September increase)<br /><br />Total likes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Total Facebook likes over time<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />When the promotional video I released went as viral as It did I went through the full fear cycle, from a constant nagging feeling like you forgot to lock your door before leaving home to full blown paranoia after freedom hosting and I can tell you it&#039;s not nice and at that moment I realized to be successful in this industry you have to be ready and willing to face time for your beliefs.<br /><br />Perhaps naively I told myself should I ever be arrested my stance is that throughout history freedom fighters of one sort of another have always come with a voice or political representation attached, I viewed Atlantis and by extension Silk Road as freedom fighters in the war on drugs and while I support the cause I have no involvement in the so called crimes they commit and only speak on their behalf.<br />I mean if Al Capone was still fighting his was on prohibition in this day and age I&#039;m sure he&#039;d have a social media presence too and I&#039;d be glad to represent him.<br /><br />To those who have lost funds, I truly apologize if it was the result of my work that brought you to Atlantis, If it means anything they had me going too. With that in mind I will be donating 1 bitcoin out the few I received from the owners on closure to the vendor pool being collected for Sean&#039;s Outpost and the remainder I will use to keep this blog running (perhaps under a new url)<br /><br />With regard to my future I considered going public for a short period but in this day and age where you no longer need to commit a crime to be considered a threat I thought against talking too much, As the kind of person who hates to waste I&#039;ve consumed too much of these forums over the last months to disappear without trace so with that in mind I will continue to be a passive part of the Silk Road community and blog about the changing darknet scene under this pseudonym. For now I&#039;m going to re-use the ill fated Atlantis blog which was I was working on when the news broke, Perhaps it can stand as a reminder that trust needs to be earned in this world.<br /><br />One thing Silk Road has always had over Atlantis is a real feeling of solidarity among it&#039;s members and that&#039;s what will make or break this place in the long haul but for now I hope I can now settle in among you guys in the rank and file and may the road rise up to meet you guys in the long struggle ahead<br /><br />Heisenberg 2.0<br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJSRu9PAAoJEDr/W2CU8yi6XhUQAJ2jnNjwzLkqEDJNgEI2vsNo<br />pBtthzinlul8fvzHGDk2lPRmFRBkqoj2MbtvMAw5raLAg0gCrdpn5ekBvdhGcv2F<br />xphyWfZwYlHziid3LCVDEyfjVpNoOrH3QFrTeUHJxSMQe4A+xpdYvlI+DX0nkt2Q<br />D0d5i/86pk2z3S1PndOPDcG+bqmG/Jk/J79Znz82ZXXdVz9otPVmhl96XGsklMI7<br />2q94WCxaR1A2RoamXZ9pVUKLrIWJn01iwcGkbqI9e3fd9t5LXteTKzTNYeE+Tklg<br />zOielFuG35JPN6jdzoWUiTdolpaZURbscNb1eoC9Ni2E44ekLRqbiy0Ar3URD5LH<br />0yLjlaMJVLTVTkqyQExcvhwm5ArQTNZ6qd6J4EcKE4cCPjS/Jo8BIm2VSZr6u9Jr<br />0vpnJn/Z+JEFAKyQddgJPN7okWagPQR3FspA7cv7FugAnzkbLeVG+wesr3pLLaGr<br />bj5+lbaxAsq3E+ckdXZKTcrkCJQwYhvvlmomllC+V4NeqJfF4Vr5LR0qIT4Hzr1s<br />OJ+E6+VgIi9hDdm1PfOYjCYmP0nlLoMaRVOV5lx/cZJ16VKd9pLaiXr+Pwuf0FaM<br />EKCNr4Zmpx31PHlFnFaPlo2nb0UorKbAbN2wDaIn7R/ryMhgczPehbEbqU8frLiV<br />KuXof67lo81EiLG7unvy<br />=VYHL<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br /><br />

				Quote from Heisnburg.20&nbsp; 10/7/2013.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Princess peach is a whore who stole my money &quot; Interesting choice&nbsp; for a first post.<br /><br />Quote from Heisenburg.20&nbsp; &nbsp;10/7/2013&nbsp; &quot;whats the point anyway, to waste cops time????? &quot;&nbsp; a spamming mod.<br /><br />Quote from Heisenburg.20&nbsp; « on: July 17, 2013, 12:18 pm » Hi there I am forum mod over at Atlantis and been trying to catch these now for a while,If you registered or logged in through that link please contact SR support immediately and consider changing your passwords if you use the same ones on any other sites.If you have an Atlantis account please get in touch with support there too.<br />I&#039;ve now reported this to mods and asked the URL be added to the profanity/blacklist so it cant be re-posted thanks and we are doing our best to nip these links in the bud. <br />OK so he is a mod on the forums, apparently.<br /><br />Quote from Heisenburg.20&nbsp; &nbsp; « on: September 01, 2013, 12:26 pm » &quot;Nobody is gone anywhere :) site is down for brief maintenance period and this is just a terrible attempt by the OP to spread uncertainty and doubt if somebody even wanted to do a runner would it not be easier to leave the site online and keep the scam running&quot;&nbsp; . Liar liar pants on fire. <br /><br />and last but not least my personal favourite. « on: August 06, 2013, 03:07 pm » &quot; Atlantis admin here.We have taken several steps to stop the proliferation of these links including editing our site so that the login page asks you to check the url.In relation to the phishing site, it&#039;s a transparent proxy site which logged user passwords but shared the same characteristics as ours (server time etc). It works in the same way that onion.to and onion.sh services work but captures your data as it passes through hence why we put the notice on the real site<br />.make sure you are always visiting through atlantisrky4es5q.onion, Best is to either bookmark it or remember it as I do&quot;atlantis rocky 4 esquire 5 onions . onion :)....&quot;<br />He&#039;s been promoted to admin now. Lawl<br /><br />Here&#039;s a cracker...quote from heisenbud ( sic) talking about the Eastern European theif Heisenburg.20.....<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;The first post I read of yours on SR was about how you convinced SR admins to use the SMF filter to block the spam Atalantis URL&#039;s being posted, though someone else had posted that hours earlier and you used that for your own benefit. You lost all respect from me for that. No loss, Atlantis had no customers and mostly teenage sellers, shame, but you reap what you sow.&quot;<br /><br />World keep on turning.<br /><br />There you have it a thief and bullshitter...<br />.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t see how Facebook &#039;likes&#039; translate into anything real, least of all any possible correlation to how much and and how frequently people may be spending on a Dark Web site. They could just indicate people hearing of the site and liking the concept or wanting to be associated with something &#039;radical&#039;.

				Well said Libertas.<br /><br />I agree that it was ridiculous to make a FB page for a supposedly underground black market website, both for the admins and the fans that would be a hugely unneeded risk of security. You have to be pretty dumb to want to be associated on FB with something like that.<br /><br />However, everyone makes mistakes. I&#039;ve said/done some really stupid shit and I&#039;m sure we all have. Hopefully a lesson was learned by all. It certainly is a good lesson for us on the Road and reminds us that we need to keep SR underground.

				I believe the fb page along with the video and any other bold promotions were indeed intended to bring a lot of traffic to Atlantis, but for the sole purpose of quickly&nbsp; pumping in as much $ as possible with the intentions of cashing out once satisfied; scam.

				Thanks for your perspective, Heisenberg.<br /><br />Now that the Atlantis admins have been shown to be shady, what do you think are the odds that they ran the phishing proxy? Doesn&#039;t seem so far fetched now. I believe they were struggling financially, which doesn&#039;t mean they were in the red, but they weren&#039;t making enough money to pay the salaries of 5 admins. The phishing proxy would allow them to:<br /><br />1. Spam the SR forum and reviews with plausible deniability<br />2. Get new sign ups<br />3. Plunder SR accounts for extra cash<br /><br />Obviously they put up a good front of denying it, and even added a banner, 6 weeks later, which you wouldn&#039;t see if you had JavaScirpt disabled, but I still think they are the most likely people who were running it.<br /><br />

I went from a freelance Tech/Social media gun for hire who&#039;s only darknet experience was reading the articles that came out in Gawker and other media about a year ago to absorbing every single thread of information on the Silk Road forums in as little time possible.<br />Of course I didn&#039;t learn everything fast enough as &quot;Astor&quot; and other forum members pointed out on a few occasions but in three months I went from just about knowing PGP and that it&#039;s a good idea to utilize a VPN over TOR to knowing real security means physical isolation and never saying what exact security measures you use besides &quot;all of it&quot;.<br /><br />Unfortunately I think it was similar case for Admin at Atlantis, While they knew what they were getting into and were quite adept, A lot of security holes have been found in TOR of late along with a few supercomputer purchases potentially capable of breaking the RSA 1024/2048 encryption used to run the TOR network and other &quot;uncrackable&quot; encryption methods.<br />The Atlantis admin were very level headed guys and I firmly believe closure was a case of the con&#039;s started outweighing the pros at a time where it wasn&#039;t too late to get out, destroy any evidence and move on with a semi-clean slate. My guess is they went from having 100% faith in the technology to recently realizing it&#039;s not foolproof nor future-proof and like DPR said in his post on Atlantis closing &quot;the fear&quot; is something everybody has to deal with and make peace with by themselves and for that 99.9% assurance in your security is never enough unless you are willing to face the heat if that 0.01% comes up some day.<br /><br />I think claims the site was unprofitable are far from true and on the contrary if the plan was always to close shop when the piggy bank was full then now was the time, While I don&#039;t have sales figures the traffic to all the social media pages was at an all time high and I believe money was rolling in faster than ever and I was hearing reports of support response times being slower than ever.<br /><br />The below screenshot shows the rate we were picking up fans on social media, (Note the huge September increase)<br /><br />Total likes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Total Facebook likes over time<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />When the promotional video I released went as viral as It did I went through the full fear cycle, from a constant nagging feeling like you forgot to lock your door before leaving home to full blown paranoia after freedom hosting and I can tell you it&#039;s not nice and at that moment I realized to be successful in this industry you have to be ready and willing to face time for your beliefs.<br /><br />Perhaps naively I told myself should I ever be arrested my stance is that throughout history freedom fighters of one sort of another have always come with a voice or political representation attached, I viewed Atlantis and by extension Silk Road as freedom fighters in the war on drugs and while I support the cause I have no involvement in the so called crimes they commit and only speak on their behalf.<br />I mean if Al Capone was still fighting his was on prohibition in this day and age I&#039;m sure he&#039;d have a social media presence too and I&#039;d be glad to represent him.<br /><br />To those who have lost funds, I truly apologize if it was the result of my work that brought you to Atlantis, If it means anything they had me going too. With that in mind I will be donating 1 bitcoin out the few I received from the owners on closure to the vendor pool being collected for Sean&#039;s Outpost and the remainder I will use to keep this blog running (perhaps under a new url)<br /><br />With regard to my future I considered going public for a short period but in this day and age where you no longer need to commit a crime to be considered a threat I thought against talking too much, As the kind of person who hates to waste I&#039;ve consumed too much of these forums over the last months to disappear without trace so with that in mind I will continue to be a passive part of the Silk Road community and blog about the changing darknet scene under this pseudonym. For now I&#039;m going to re-use the ill fated Atlantis blog which was I was working on when the news broke, Perhaps it can stand as a reminder that trust needs to be earned in this world.<br /><br />One thing Silk Road has always had over Atlantis is a real feeling of solidarity among it&#039;s members and that&#039;s what will make or break this place in the long haul but for now I hope I can now settle in among you guys in the rank and file and may the road rise up to meet you guys in the long struggle ahead<br /><br />Heisenberg 2.0<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your post was post had contradictions and FUD.<br />You implied multiple times that AM was a long scam but said the admin were &quot;very level headed guys&quot; who closed because they needed too.<br />If it was a scam it would have been more profitable not to give us a week to take our coins out, but the closing was rushed and unorganised.<br />From what I can tell you had as much contact with the admins as me. I always found them open, honest and friendly.<br /><br />&quot;real feeling of solidarity among it&#039;s members&quot; - I&#039;m sorry if you never felt it, maybe it&#039;s because you weren&#039;t there very long or because it was just your job to bring in clearnet noobs (where vendor like me had to try and teach them the ropes). I felt as much solidarity and community on AM as here, maybe more as it was smaller. Except I never had trouble with crazies or scammers there. Support was very hands-on. Before the troubles started the admins were hungry to innovate and upgrade.<br />I&#039;ll admit they did make mistakes and did things that I don&#039;t think were smart, but any methods to make it easier to break these stupid drugs laws is alright by me.<br />I hope SR becomes stronger in both security and community, and also continues to innovate.
