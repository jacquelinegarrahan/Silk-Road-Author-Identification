				Ah my best friend dbz.<br /><br />I was on seroquel and a number of other psych meds including respiridone at one point and it still didn&#039;t seem to work. I tried ambien for about a week and it lost it&#039;s effect rather quickly. Benzos don&#039;t work anymore unless I abuse them and I&#039;m not trying to do that. So I sleep every other day, whatcha gonna do I guess right? I exercise every day, cut down on smoking, tried eating more at night, tried eating less. Meditation, etc etc etc. Nothing seems to work. Idk. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll find something eventually.

				cannabis definitely helps me immensely with getting a good night&#039;s sleep. aside from that, the best thing i&#039;ve found is jarrow formulas sleep optimizer. it&#039;s made with natural herbs and amino acids (gaba, hops flower, valerian, melatonin and tryptophan) that synergize to provide a deep, restful sleep. cheap, natural and effective! what more could you want? :D

				i think one of the more important things we may have not thought of is caffeine use.<br />try to stop drinking all coffee/soda/energy drinks and see how your sleep is after that&nbsp; ;)<br />it is a stimulant that blocks adenosine receptors, after all&nbsp; ::)

Those are known as some of the most heavily sedating drugs around. I understand you know of all the atypicals and such, I&#039;m just curious if you have tried zyprexa yourself. It is the most sedating of them, and generally if one doesn&#039;t work the other might, but I&#039;m sure you already know that. Obviously you&#039;ve tried smoking weed, and other drugs. How about something more intuitive, but less obvious. Have you tried not trying to go to sleep that day, and just waiting til the next to reset your sleep cycle? I find I have to force my way through to the next day sometimes, in order to stop falling asleep at 3-5 AM all the time.

I&#039;m currently using triazolam which is pretty much one of the strongest benzos out there, but my plan when I&#039;m more financially stable is to cycle each day use of benzos, hypnotics, alcohol, weed, and opiates to help sleep when I need it. Insomnia really sucks especially when it&#039;s been several days and you start hallucinating from exhaustion. Good luck.

				My routine is to hit a couple pipes/1 hitters outside at night before bed. The difference from being cold outside to being warm when I climb into bed makes me feel really tired. I also like to have background noise when trying to get to sleep, find it much harder if the room is silent. Hope helps.

				I feel you man .Everyone is different though. In my case I&#039;ve tried all the non-medicinal techniques and none of them have worked. NYQuil doesn&#039; do shit unless I chug half a bottle. Ambien worked for 2 weeks and lost it&#039;s effect after that. It really comes down to the individual.

				You know what... I don&#039;t actually have any solution whatsoever for you. I&#039;m a (moderate to very) heavy cannabis user, use it every day for my various medical ailments and that certainly helps with sleep. As that&#039;s no good I&#039;m clueless... <br /><br />However I would like to say this - I really feel for anyone who simply cannot get any sleep. Don&#039;t even want to consider how this effects people&#039;s day to day lives - I&#039;m now retired and am at home most of the day - but for those who have to work as well... Wow. <br /><br />Best of luck finding a workable solution.

				I have been an insomniac for many years. I always give myself 45 minutes to an hour relaxing with a book in bed with a small light on above me, I find this helps to ease myself into sleep mode. Each night I drink a cup of camomile tea and take Melatonin. I also have Zopiclone and Lorazepam on hand for when my ritual doesn&#039;t work. Some other tips: My ability to stay asleep suffers greatly when I drink too much alcohol. A glass of red wine or two is quite helpful before bed, but I will cut myself off there. A small amount of weed can help, but I need to be extremely hydrated or I will be awake half the night reaching for water.

				I&#039;m surprised no one&#039;s mentioned this, but as a long-term chronic insomnia sufferer, I don&#039;t hit the hay without 50mg+ of diphenhydramine. even that cheap stuff at any CVS or 7-11 will do - benadryl, nyquil if you can use low doses. I&#039;m a pretty serious cannabis smoker, and rarely any weed puts me out anymore - I love me some OTC sleep aid.

Take GHB. It is sold as Xyrem in the U.S. for narcolepsy, but it is a very powerful sedative which apparently gives you amazing, relaxing sleep. It works on GABA, so it actually is pretty harmless. The known effects as the &quot;date rape drug&quot; come from it&#039;s side effects when mixed with alchohol. There are people here who sell GHB, i would ask around blade

I have done a little research on this stuff, and when it is prescribed it is for chronic sleep disorders. This really is something most people wouldn&#039;t consider or haven&#039;t thought of. It works on a very small molecule in your brain, will have very few if any interactions with most drugs(DO NOT MIX WITH ALCHOHOL. THIS IS WHY IT WAS MADE ILLEGAL UNDER THE DATE RAPE DRUG ARGUMENT). If you can avoid alchohol, and do your research on how this interacts with other substances you wish to try, i think this might very well be the end to your sleep issues. I hope someone here will be able to recommend you a good GHB vendor, if not, please start a thread on the rumor mill inquiring as to how to obtain some without a hassle.<br /><br />May you all sleep peacefully and blissfully, I know the pain of insomnia, true relief can do wonders

				GHB is just another benzo and while it will work, it will produce tolerance after a while just like everything else. I&#039;ve been on this merry go round for years and i have found no magical answers. <br /><br />What works best for me is to take something different each day and do not take the same general category of meds two days in a row or very often. For example, i take benzos 2x per week but not 2 days in a row and i use different ones. I use kpins and lorazepam. I use ambien once a week, seroquel once, pot once, olanzapine once, mirtazapine once.<br /><br />Even with this strategy tolerance is creeping in. Another trick i use to keep from upping the dose is to use something weak with it that doesn&#039;t work by itself but works with the main ingredient. For example, a gram of gaba or 6 to 9 mg melatonin or 1/2 an etizolam.

It was causing a lot of headaches, which lead to irritibility and caused other mood side effects. It was developed as an anti-depressant after all. <br /><br />Seroquel and Zyprexa are two very powerful and sedating atypical-antipsychotics that are sometimes prescribed for off-label sleep use. Seroquel more than zyprexa as far as i know, at least in the States.

GHB is not a benzo - but has some similarities of action. Gambino&#039;s point re dosing above is valid. When using GHB you want to take smallest amount possible the is just enough to tip you over the edge. And no more.<br /><br />Melatonin and Sceletium are two other things you can look at. Another is cut all stimulants even tea and coffee if you haven&#039;t already. And ore exercise during the day,<br /><br />BG

				I used to take prescribed medications for insomnia but stopped when I found the wonders of Cannabis, combined with lifestyle changes and I deal with it just fine without the meds now.<br /><br />I just make sure I&#039;ve had enough exercise (mental or physical!) throughout the day. And make sure I&#039;ve had a productive day. Do NOT exercise a few hours before sleeping as this will make you feel more active, not less. Also, don&#039;t eat a few hours before sleeping, and if you have to make it a small portion and something that&#039;s a slow release of energy (fats, not sugars). Don&#039;t shower before bed either, as that wakes you up. And don&#039;t play video games / poker for an hour or so before sleeping either, as that makes your brain very active.<br /><br />Also, for me, making sure I&#039;ve had a productive day where I&#039;m happy with what I&#039;ve achieved that day, and then end it with a fat blazing session for your reward sends me straight off to sleep. Back in the day when my insomnia was at its peak, I used to smoke throughout the day, do nothing productive and have depressive thoughts when I was trying to sleep.<br /><br />Now I get off my arse, do useful things with my time as often as I can and the cannabis at the end is the reward and the sleep aid in one.<br /><br />Don&#039;t need pills anymore.<br />I don&#039;t even use chemical sleep aids after a night out on MDMA anymore.<br /><br />Hope this post helps someone anyway, I know how fucking shit it can be sometimes. Even now, my insomnia comes and goes on occasion, I&#039;ve not fully conquered it and probably never will. But what I spoke about above really helps me get my rest :)

Put yourselves in our shoes. You&#039;re not going to sleep for at least a couple days because you&#039;re an insomniac. You can either feel tired by the end of day one. Start to feel lousy by day 2. Start to feel really miserable by day 3. And around days 4 and 5 a lot more effects become pronounced as well. By about day 2 focusing on work is difficult and you just feel like shit.<br />OR....<br />You take uppers around the end of day one, feel alert and awake throughout the entire bender, manage to get work done, and ride the crash to get yourself to fall asleep.<br /><br />Which do you think is better? I&#039;m not lazy, I have trouble working when I haven&#039;t slept in 72 hours and can&#039;t think straight but am still not able to fall asleep.<br />Go fuck yourself, you prick. I&#039;m anything but lazy and perfectly capable of working sober.
