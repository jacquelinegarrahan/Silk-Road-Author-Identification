				Hey everyone,<br /><br />&nbsp; After much consideration and thought, I have decided to go on vacation for various reasons spanning several areas of concern.&nbsp; If you have a current order in with me it will be packed and shipped as soon as possible, or you can pm me to cancel your order if you choose.&nbsp; If you have an emergency and you have been a very good previous client for some time you may contact me in that regard, however no promises are being made.<br /><br />&nbsp; Basically, I&#039;m been inundated with buyers that are ummm shall we say problematic which has made selling here lately quite irritating..&nbsp; let me give you and example I just got in my pm box:&nbsp; &quot;subject:&nbsp; CANCEL MY ORDER NOW OR I WILL MAKE A NEGATIVE FORUM POST ABOUT YOU&quot;&nbsp; lol what kinda of pm is that, some kinda half ass bullshit attempt to threaten me?&nbsp; Wow...&nbsp; like Im hard to get along with or something, damn.<br /><br />&nbsp; Or how about this Resolution center dispute from a &quot;Buyer stats: total transactions: 0, refund rate: 0%&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />***********<br />&quot;Substance initially looked like hash, but it became clear upon opening &amp; trying that it was some sort of licorice-like substance, similar to some fake stuff I got a few years ago in Prague, Czech Republic. Contained no THC and gave me nothing but a head &amp; throat ache. I understand that I&#039;m new to SR so I am only requesting a 75 % refund which I think is pretty reasonable since 100 % of the product was not as described. I let at least 3 others try the product and they all agree. i still have a good bit left and can enclose pictures if desired.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Anon3573&quot;<br />***********<br /><br />So I reply:<br /><br />***********<br />&quot;I pride myself on providing access to a premium quality product with impeccable service of which I am very well known for. If at any time someone is not satisfied with what they receive I go to great lengths to find out why and what can be done to insure the exchange is mutually beneficial. If you are fair and truthful with me you will receive nothing but the same in return.<br /><br />However, your suggestion that my product is &quot;fake&quot; tells me that you are either ignorant or want to get something for nothing. Probably both. Whatever the case, I&#039;m not interested.&quot;<br />***********<br /><br />So, then they reply:<br /><br />***********<br />&quot;I&#039;m not suggesting it was fake. It tasted exactly like real licorice. It&#039;s just simply not hash. It did not have any sort of effect no matter how much was smoked; I smoked it on the stove, put it in a bowl, and rolled it in with a joint- nothing. Nada. your claim that I want something for nothing is incorrect, I want something for the 12 bitcoins I gave you and all I received in return was a product that is no different from fake stuff I&#039;ve gotten from europe. I&#039;ve showed your product to real dealers and they have verified my claim. I wish there was a way to simply return what you sent me but I don&#039;t know that there is. I guess that&#039;s what I get for thinking I can do business on the deep web without getting taken advantage of. It&#039;s too bad you&#039;re &quot;not interested&quot; in providing the &quot;impeccable service&quot; you&#039;re supposedly known for, since your good feedback was the only reason I chose to spend/waste my money buying from you in the first place. Thanks for nothing, and if my problems are not addressed either by you or by the administrators of this site whom you&#039;re also defrauding, I&#039;ve certainly learned my lesson about trusting sites like SR.<br /><br />&quot;If at any time someone is not satisfied with what they receive I go to great lengths to find out why and what can be done to insure the exchange is mutually beneficial.&quot;<br /><br />Nicely worded and completely false. I sent you a message 11 days ago about this issue and received no reply, hence the reason I escalated into resolution. If you had displayed the slightest desire to solve my issue we would not be at this stage.<br /><br />Why there&#039;s a problem: The product cost more than regular hash off the street with none of the actual hash that would usually accompany it. Whether fake or simply too weak to be worth selling, the product was not as described.<br /><br />What can be done about this problem: Give me 70 percent of my money back since I received 0 percent satisfaction from the order. i think that&#039;s more than fair.<br /><br />Anon&quot;<br />************<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; In all honesty I&#039;ve only had&nbsp; *** ONE ***&nbsp; dispute go to the point in resolution where the SR admin had to step in and in that case I got the full amount cause the dude never responded when I posted the DCN# showing it had been received (and he had a 56% refund rate)&nbsp; YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT, IVE ONLY HAD ONE DISPUTE TO GO TO SR ADMIN FOR RESOLUTION&nbsp; -=+EVER+=-&nbsp; OVER MY ENTIRE TIME AS A VENDOR HERE.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how long Ive been vending hash here for one of the most reasonable prices for the real deal but I have 100&#039;s if not 1000&#039;s of feedbacks on it all praising it as quality and the price being very reasonable.&nbsp; Really I don&#039;t even understand what this dude is saying when he says &quot;I&#039;m not suggesting it was fake. It tasted exactly like real licorice. It&#039;s just simply not hash.&quot;&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that a contradictory statement?&nbsp; lol... so your not saying its fake, your just saying its not real.&nbsp; Seriously, thats as whack ass as it gets.<br /><br />Someone holla at me and let me know when the recent uprise of scammers and plain ol&#039; idiots has subsided a bit,<br />Paperchasing

				Also many buyers here&nbsp; think they have more rights than the vendors and are getting way to spolied. I remember a few years ago vending online before SR existed and the buyers back than were wayyy more chill and forget about escrow because it was all about your SoS rep so they had to pay up front. And where wayyy more cooler than many SR buyers that start to talk shit about 1-2 days of none communication, when the buyers back than where just thanks full for your service and wouldn&#039;t bug you if you didn&#039;t reply for a few days but like I said where just thankful.

				When I first started, I had very very few issues. The one or two issues that I did have were simple mistakes that I verified that was my fault. I was new and didn&#039;t have my system down. Then, as SR grew, I would get claims like &quot;I ordered 20 pills but there are only 12&quot; I do each order by themselves. i never do more than one order at a time to make sure that I dont make an error. then, after i put that order together, i do a reverse count on how many items i should have left. On top of that I tripple count how many I put in the package and then have another set of eyes verify that the correct aount are in the package.<br /><br />I had months of not having one isssue. then, for some reaosn, the last few months, my issue seem to happen at least once or twice a week. still not a whole lot, but I know that most, if not all of the buyers are trying to scam me. the hint that i think thats the case is they always bring up the&nbsp; review issue.. &quot;I havent left my review, i hope you can resolve it before i leave it..&quot; In the past,&nbsp; i just gave iin and gave them the missing items. If I thought that there was even a one percent chance of them being right, i woule apologize up the ass and make it right. But, I can count to a hundred, at least, and with all the counter measures that i have in place make it impossible to make an error. I even write on the DCN the amount that was put in the package, just in case &quot;somehow&quot; i did make a mistake, and whatever number is on the DCN is th nuner that was sent.<br /><br />Or if Im selling that is by weight, buyers saying that its short by 1/2 of what should have been there. I realize that i could be off by a iittle but by 1/2? now way.. I think that since we are in this black market business, people think we deserre to be ripped offf. Again, 99 percent of buyers are great. its that one percnet or less that ruins it for everyone. I have been thinking about just selling to buyers that i know are ok, yes, it may hurt me, but i, too am tired of the reverse scamming, etc. <br /><br />Again, the majority of buyers are awesome. its those very few that make life so damned difficult. I say, hold&nbsp; your ground, take it to resolution and show them that you wont fold.. I made the opposite choiice and gave in, which lead to more problems, but now, ive got it nder control... god luck, youll et thru it..

				Don&#039;t let the haters fuck with your game mane.&nbsp; <br /><br />It ain&#039;t no fucking bubble which is obviously preferable, but it&#039;s some damn good bargain bin hash.&nbsp; Dollar for dollar it&#039;s actually some of the best hash on SR.&nbsp; Gets you nice and ripped and does taste very good also.&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna grab up some more before 4/20, hope your back in action before then.

				And this is just one more reason why escrow sucks, it makes reverse scamming all the more easier to do. :-( You should just start charging double to protect yourself from the 50/50 escrow and give back 50% after the buyer has finalized.

				Wow, and wtf.<br />Nomad said it all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had many transactions, and a few mis ships, but everyone was cool.<br />I think I&#039;ve even dealt with a few of you vendors. You were all cool.<br />As far as the hash tasting like Licorice?Does he mean tasting it?<br />No way, like I said, Nomad said it all. The hash it what it is.<br />Maybe somebody is messing with him, or he is.<br /><br /><br />Clam down, and think for a while.<br />Sell some more of that cheap weed&nbsp; :-*<br />

				A few weeks back I wrote up a way to completely insulate yourself, as a vendor, from scam buyers and feedblackmail. I think it&#039;s actually a legitimate way to overcome this issue, not just some off the wall idea.

				Paperchasing popped my Silk Road cherry with that Black Thai Hash about half a year ago. That hash was definitely real and the also cheapest one could find on here. I can&#039;t imagine the amount of bullshit vendors have to deal with and it&#039;s unfortunate that a few can ruin it for the many. I&#039;ve got my fingers crossed that we&#039;ll see Paper again soon.
