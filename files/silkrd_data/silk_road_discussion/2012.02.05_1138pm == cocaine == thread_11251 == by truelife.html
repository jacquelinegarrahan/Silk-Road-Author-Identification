				In my early years, it seemed to me the strongest stuff on the streets was the slightly off white to yellow tinged coke.<br /><br />However, reagent grade cocaine (pure) is fluffy completely white powder.<br /><br />I have no experience regarding any coke on the road though.

				What I want to know is why the coke on SR is so expensive... I know its probably really pure but a lot of it is 100+ a gram. Is it really that good compared to the coke you&#039;d buy on the street for like $50 a g?

An old friend of mine used to deal copious amounts of cocaine and when he first started he saw that grams were $90.. which seemed crazy. But what most dealers end up doing is chopping it with B Vitamins, Lidocaine, etc. The $50 a gram stuff is most definitely stomped on a couple times as opposed to the coke we can get here for more expensive.<br /><br />

If it&#039;s yellowish, you know it&#039;s been cut, or that it contains impurities leftover from the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Color alone really isn&#039;t something to base purity on though. Most cutting agents are also white.

				If you look at the photo of tetravort, he has the best coke, but not white but yellowish, also that of moveitnice and poseidon is yellowish , I believe that the fish scales yellowish, is coca&nbsp; the best ever

But....... I have actually tried the product today from tetravort and I stand by my statement.... Yes, it is THAT good. Worth every inflated bitcoin.
