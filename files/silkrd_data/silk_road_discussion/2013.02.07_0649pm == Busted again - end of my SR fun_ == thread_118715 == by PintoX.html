				So, once again after many years i had the police busting into my house, searching and finding some substances a few days ago...<br /><br />This WASNT because of my sr activity but because of some evidence found at my friend who got busted a week before me - but the findings in my house were all from SR and highly uncommon in my country, obviously there was no room for too many games and i had to accept responsibility for the drugs and will be prosecuted soon enough,&nbsp; and i guess it will end with some fine and suspended sentence. (small quantites)<br /><br />Now,&nbsp; the problem i have is that a few days before i got busted i had some order which is on its way and cannot be cancelled at this point since it was already shipped,&nbsp; what leaves me scared to death that it will also be caught.<br /><br />I will probably talk to a lawyer in the next few days but i cant help wondering if i should come clean to the cops regarding this order or should i just wait for it to come and swallow te whole thing...<br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp; im so sad that this will put an end to my fun in SR for now, not ony because of the LE but because of my family that was disturbed by te damn cops...&nbsp; Still looking for other drop points<br /><br />Bmmer!!

				Shit dude! I feel for you.. seems like that&#039;s the way most people get caught. Through friends and connects. As there is nothing you can do about the order I wouldn&#039;t say anything because one of two things will happen<br /><br />1. They don&#039;t notice the package (you do not get more charges)<br />2. They do notice it (Essentially the same as you telling them)<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the police will lessen the charges because you tell them ahead of time about a shipment.

				Consult with your lawyer ASAP about that package. Have you told LE that you acquired drugs online (on SR)? As you know, anybody can send you mail and drugs in mail, so you can&#039;t be arrested solely for having drugs in the mail box (read: in the mail box, not bringing them inside your home). So consult your lawyer how can you approach this and if they could (as it should be pretty obvious to LE that you have ordered that mail) charge you without you taking the shipment outside the mail box. And try to make a tactic what to do with the shipment - take it inside, and write ASAP something like RETURN TO SENDER and stuff. Or you could take it inside and RUN RUN RUN to the toilet and just send all the shit to hell. But this could maybe also be the felony of destroying evidence, so again consult your lawyer. I&#039;m sure he can advise you the way to dispose these drugs without breaking any law.<br /><br />If you live in a apparment building or some house with many different residents with different post boxes, you could give the keys mail box to a neighbour (trusted one) and when he empties his mail box, he could also secretly empty yours, and you can be in plain sight in front of the house meanwhile, so LE can see you and not control the mail box (if they would be that dumm of course).<br /><br />Or just seal your mail box somehow and don&#039;t give a fuck :D Better being charged for not having a mail box (it is illegal to not have one for the place you live in I think) is better than being charged for drugs (again depends of the type and quantity).

				No good&nbsp; :(<br /><br />You must live a pretty remote part of the world here in the uk I cant think of one single product that is not available in rl too only difference on sr you get quality control well most of the time&nbsp; :-\<br />Im a weed smoker so it means I can choose specific strains for my wants and needs I&#039;m just trying to get by in this fucked up country yet less than an hour on a plane I can be in Holland with all the medical grade weed I can smoke only thing about going to Amsterdam though is fair enough it only takes 50 mins on a plane and flights are pretty cheap if you book in advance yeah its all great but every time I go I get mad ideas in my head about bring back Ounces and Ounces of hash and weed its just to damn hard leaving all the good stuff behind and I think thats the main reason people from uk dont go to Amsterdam every other weekend its just to much of a head fuck leaving behind your smoke or just bringing back a few crumbs<br /><br />Anyhow lay low, stay calm, be cool dont worry to much worse things could happen trust me.

				Sorry to hear that. The only piece of advice I can give you is this. <br /><br />DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TALK TO THE POLICE. <br /><br />If you must talk to someone about it make it your lawyer. And if you must speak to the police, consult your lawyer first and do it in the presence of your lawyer. Make those fuckers do their job. Don&#039;t make it any easier for them. You might think you are helping your situation by alerting them to that pack but they are thinking that pack means extra weight and extra charges. Possibly the difference between felony and misdemeanor, or possession vs. distribution. They will try to fuck you.<br /><br />As for other advice I&#039;m not going to pretend I know how to handle this situation or even give you misguided information based on my opinion. I do think the advice given is sound and believe others will agree. Good luck. Be smart and try to stay safe.

				What is the point of coming clean to police? How does it help in ANY WAY?<br /><br />Coming clean just means they don&#039;t have to prove shit. Their still gonna bust you just the same.

				Thanks guys for the answers, im well aware&nbsp; with how to deal with the police (dont talk etc...) as unfortunatlly this is far from my first encounter with them,&nbsp; obviously i admitted i own the stuff that were found in my house as i have wife and kids and will do anything to stop the police from bothering them, they caused them quie alot of pain in very short time.<br /><br />They also took my wife at the beginning for questioning regarding me and my friend, so after i did not talk to them, i told them straight i will take responsibility for everything if they let her go and wont arrest me, which they did and sent me to house arrest, they also took all my computers and mobile phones (got 1 phone back and a tablet pc that im using to write here now) <br /><br />Regarding the package they know i had some stuff trough the mail - they were pretty shocked its possibe acctually. I dont think they monitor my box now (private home) as they never heard of such case in past...&nbsp; <br /><br />I truely think that the smarest thing to do is to talk to my lawyer and see what he say, the reason i considered coming clean is that i will probably wont be charged at all if i will say i cant stop it, as much as they are bastards.<br /><br />Im afraid that the possibility of getting the letter (again some small amount) and running is not practical - cause in case they do monitor the mail they will arrest me way before it reaches my door,&nbsp; it will be enough of evidence for them in my case weather i pick it up or not (it wont be the first time in my country) - unless i will have some very good explanation why someone is mailing me drugs, <br /><br />Botton line for that -&nbsp; its not the punishment im scared of, as it wont be too bad, but the mess of them disturbing my life and my family, this what i want to avoid....<br /><br />Just wanted to share with the community here that i like so much, and get this off my heart, i will leave the legal part to the lawyers :)

				anything i would say regarding advice would be redundant as everything has been said. plus you seem to know what you&#039;re doing at this point. STAY STRONG MY BROTHER. we&#039;re rooting for you. <br />EDIT: forgot to thank you for the post. this kind of information is relevant to all SR users. also, its an honorable way to go out. thank you.

				Protecting your family by any means necessary was the good thing to do. You&#039;re a responsible person. That&#039;s commendable. Don&#039;t forget : In most civilized countries, cops are only doing their jobs. They&#039;ll follow procedure, and they have families too. They understand that shit. They search if they have to and won&#039;t try and cause harm to children for kicks. Also, in a lot of countries, all trials begin with an analysis of the perp and his character. You&#039;ll be presented as a responsible family man with a drug problem. There are worst shapes to start a case in (ie resisting arrest, flushing drugs, swallowing all the LSD tabs at the first knock at the door...).<br /><br />As for the rest, let your lawyer do the work. You&#039;re probably paying him quite enough for that.

				First of all, that sucks.&nbsp; Stay strong and don&#039;t do anything without your lawyers.<br /><br />Do they know you&#039;ve been shipping it in via mail?&nbsp; If not then I doubt they&#039;re checking your mail.&nbsp; When the package comes I&#039;d either destroy it immediately or give it (unopened) to a friend (as a present *wink*).<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me asking: how much did they find?<br /><br />And in general I wouldn&#039;t assume that the cops know what they&#039;re doing too much... they aren&#039;t the brightest so don&#039;t give them the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Edit: also, how did the cops &quot;bust&quot; into your house?&nbsp; Were the doors unlocked?&nbsp; Did they have a warrant?&nbsp; And if so, how do you think they got it?&nbsp; Is it that easy to get one?

				For the love of all that is holy don&#039;t talk to the cops until you&#039;ve ran it over with a lawyer six ways of Sunday.&nbsp; Maybe you could get a plea deal for them if you agree to reveal your sources and then could get a lighter sentenance for it while laughing at them because they can&#039;t do shit about SR anyway unless the vendors you used were stupid &amp; used real sending addresses.&nbsp; Talk it over with your lawyer.

				talk to lawyer and tell him everything... if you gonna tell police about package they will fuck you up your ass and just drop more charges on you like importing narcotics for which you can get lets say 15 years. they don&#039;t care well only small amount youll get 7 years . these cops are scum believe me talking to them is tightening a noose around your neck. They want you to confess so they would get some worthless stats and these are important to them because they get a pat on a shoulder from their superiors. They don&#039;t care if they will ruin your life for abit of drugs they&#039;re just criminals with a badge.

				@livestrong -&nbsp; Thanks mate for the kind words, i really hope this is not my way to go out, but for sure i need to wait sometime now...<br /><br />@DuncanMacLeod -&nbsp; thanks!! And you are right, its was pretty easy for them to understand im not a common criminal, altough i had some troubles before im totally clean for many years. And by me acting in a respected way and not providing them with additional ammo, i went trough all the questioning in good manners and avoiding arrest, and most important - left my family out of the picture.<br /><br />@XXXotica - indeed, but as i know the system is fucked for telling me what to do in the privacy of my own house, it will not break me in the long term :) <br /><br />@danconia - i anwesred most of this in the first post, the amount were pretty small, personal use, but from 5 diffrent dtugs and imported (which is a crime by itself) they had a warrant from court of course, its really easy to get here.<br /><br />@LokeToke - they found some very obvious communication between us in hes mobile phone, this is way more than enough to get warrants here and to make me a suspect in the bigger scheme which i have no relation to. Imnot elaborating pn the case since it a &quot;high profile&quot; case here and could be easly recognized.<br /><br />@dead salmon - this is correct, luckly i have been there before and know the drill, the stuff i admitted are stuff that i can handle, i have my own business and make a good living, and i know the sentence will be far from too bad i did mention buying from SR, they had no idea what im talking about and i had to explain how tor works (based on the public info) to 4 high ranked officers and intelligence officers who understood its way out of their league once i showed them that the DEA cannot handle it - but got alot of credit for &quot;helping&quot; :)<br /><br /><br />@grdr - regarding the lawyer that is correct, regarding the rest its not fully accurate and need to be handeled diffrently in some cases. I will not get even 1 day in jail for that (again, i have been there before and dont have even a criminal record left) BUT - of course it need to be after consulting a lawyer and not on my own mind.&nbsp; I was also seeing them always as scums but this time they have acctually proved themself pretty ok and stood up for their words of letting us go after i took responsibilty. It highly depends on the case, who you are and how you act i never felt they were trying hard to destroy my life for few grams as they know im a normal citizen in general.<br /><br />Now they are trying to get more info out of me which i find pretty annoying cause its wasting my time and disturbing my wife, just call me to the station to ask stupid questions as if it will make me admit in other stuff but i will leave this to my lawyer.<br /><br />- now lets see what will be with the package, at least i will be able to swallow all and get a bit high if it arrives...<br />- if get really desperet i still have some BTC in my account and will think of some giveaway :)<br /><br />Really appreciate all the feedbacks as im not allowed to discuss this with anyone in IRL and its annoying. <br />

				Sorry to hear this happened to you, mate. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had houses raided because of stupid friends and shit, it&#039;s never good - I&#039;m sure you know that though.<br /><br />Good to see you protecting your family, the LE will see that you are honourable, not that it&#039;ll make a difference.<br /><br />Don&#039;t tell them anything, let them do their job. They are paid to work shit out, so let them do it. <br /><br />Just don&#039;t be a dick to them, don&#039;t be smug, arrogant, abusive - just let them know you can&#039;t tell them anything. If they see you as a real human being with a family, who has people that care about him etc they will go easier on you. <br /><br />Good luck

I wouldn&#039;t put it past the bastards.

				@Slicksuit - you are completley right, i always found out that the frst rule with police , even before te &quot;say nothing&quot; rule is - &#039;act like a criminal and you get treated like one, act like clueless, feared and normative person and you get treated like one&#039;.&nbsp; And than the say nothing rule :)<br /><br />@SorryMario -&nbsp; &nbsp;I never belived in the return to sender trick, i dont think we could find even onn case it helped - its super suspicious to try and return a mail that is addressed to you before even checking whats inside, especially if you are already a suspect,&nbsp; &nbsp;So i guess its either swallawing all or flushing all (if its not intercepted before...)<br />Regarding the tablet - i dont think they did anything its just local cops not experts, rearding the computer that might be dangerous since they are sent to police experts, so i just got new one for now....<br /><br />Guess we will know soon enough...

				I don&#039;t mean to be an asshole, but...<br /><br />Do not talk about current investigations on your person on here. If the police have been researching where to find drugs online (or anywhere really), it&#039;s possible they will find their way here at some point. If your forum posts all line up to what&#039;s actually going on, they can link you to the account. Furthermore; they can then search your house again based on probable cause (don&#039;t say they can&#039;t.).. and may find your package.<br /><br />If I were you, I would flush whatever is coming; weather the storm, and be more careful in the future. <br /><br />

				Don&#039;t ever tell the police more than they already know! it&#039;s usually best to keep quiet even about what you think they know or suspect because anything you say is evidence. It&#039;s common practice for the police to pressure you into confessing by saying they KNOW about your activities while they have no solid evidence, but if you don&#039;t speak they can&#039;t do shit with their suspicions.<br />Listen to your lawyer, he has given you good advice so far...

				@oldtoby &amp; fire -&nbsp; thanks guys for the advice,&nbsp; anyway I would not act with talking to my lawyer, I was posting all here just to release some steam since I have almost no one to talk to about this issue in IRL as we trying to keep a low profile,<br />I&#039;m well aware to the fact that we should not provide any evidence, I guess I was so stressed out that I didn&#039;t know what&#039;s the best thing to do anymore,&nbsp; good thing that the lawyer straightened my head on this an helped me avoid additional troubles that I could have caused to myself...

				Retard = a person who call other people retards without reading the whole story,<br /><br />As mentioned, I couldn&#039;t care less about them going easy on me - as I will be charged with possession, which is practically nothing, my interest was to avoid arrest and stopping them from bothering my family for longer time, which they did stop and did not arrest me,&nbsp; so as far as I see it, I have done the righ thing - protecting my family from their harassments, even if some anonymous guy thinks otherwise :)

I hope it plays out well for you.<br /><br />But you have to see the point of some here. (including me =)) This is SR and we order illicit products from here. We all try to discuss how to handle this situations and there is plenty information here on the forums.<br />They came to your house and found a personal amount of drugs. Period. Thats all, no importing no SR no online crime at all, right?<br />..then you talked to the officers, you said you were cooperative so they let your familie alone, telling them the story about buying drugs onlie? Come on, that was a plain stupid move. With this small amount they hadn&#039;t arrested you in the first place. And your family, whats with your family, they don&#039;t take part in this story and the cops will do nothing to them. THIS is the game we play here. We all should know that the police can come to us and they will do their job and do whatever they are allowed to.<br /><br />Now that you have given them the information what makes you sure they do not give it to the next higher department? Think about what you have done, sir!<br /><br />You have brought up new evidence to your case and if so you caused more trouble for your family and your self. <br /><br /><br />Sorry I had to write this. I hope I understood the previous posts right. <br /><br />What you should do is take the offer to delete the thread and clean you computer, if I were a cop NOW I would want your electronics. Then let the layer make the rest and DO NOT TALK TO THE POLICE! Be polite and calm, maybe tell them why you dont talk to them. Its not their business to talk to you for proving anything. This is the jop of the judge, later.<br /><br />take care<br />12345

				I dont know your exact situtaion, and im really sorry it sucks :(<br /><br />but in my opinion, i would rather My partner/kids (if i had any) sit in a police station for a couple hours and me sit in silence, than them be without a dad for 1/2/3/4 years..<br /><br /><br />I still would have STFU and waited for lawyer, even if it means my wife/kids had to sit in a police station for 24hours.<br /><br />but again, i dont know ur situation, but I just know that the only thing talking does, is dig your hole deeper..&nbsp; You&#039;ll still get your chance to tell you story, just behind the guard of a lawyer. Even if your already in the hole, do you want it to be deeper just to save the hassle of ur wife being interrogated? <br /><br />just to re-iterate what everybody says, No matter what the cops say to you. talking will NEVER help you.. <br /><br />it may get you a cup of water, A Cigerette, your wife/kids out of the police station, but in the long run.. it doent help.. you can explain your life away about being a computer geek who got carried away, with your lawyers help/advice.

				I find very interesting for people reacting quite fiercely to information, that somebody told the cops about SR. I personally don&#039;t find this to be any problem. I mean, as it has already been said, they can&#039;t do shit about it. If DEA can&#039;t, then no local police can. The only thing that they can is to warn post offices and postmen to be more alerted about anything out of the ordinary, but I don&#039;t think every postman will from then on invest all his brain power into finding anything unordinary. Firstly, they&#039;re not payed for that, and secondly, they probably don&#039;t care too much (specially the young ones :D ).<br /><br />As to what GUS said in above post, I kind of agree to him. But as PintoX said, taking guilt for everything and protecting his wife/kids is a big positive thing from a court&#039;s view. But still if you&#039;re sure it could help you, I think I would think of letting my wife spending some time in police in exchange for both of us to be guilt free.<br /><br />But you of course have to consider that having your parents arrested affects the child (depends of age of course) and they become confused, scared and maybe loose some confidence in parents. But this shouldn&#039;t affect them long term, if you come back in a matter of hours. Just a little shock, that&#039;s all. Specially if, as I assume Pintox wasn&#039;t really arrested with a big bam, you get arrested peacefully and the handcuffs are more or less birocratic procedure

				If feel you had to say something, WHICH WE DISAGREE WITH, that is your choice we guess.<br /><br />BUT you do not have to go all out and explain tor, go into detail, or be debriefed in detail by 4 intel officers.<br /><br />come on. how you get drugs? - i see ad online and buy from person on msg board - i see ad on search engine - i talk to friend in random chat room but have not seen them online in few days. <br /><br />there are MANY ways to lead to same end you seek. think americans say something about skinning cat?<br /><br />in some swine countries, there are extra charges and enhanced gulag time for &#039;sophistication&#039;. even if you not in one, TELL ALL is not necessary. and cause problems for others maybe and maybe for you in future too. understand what we mean?&nbsp; <br /><br />re: there is nothing &#039;they&#039; can do to stop SR. be smart, maybe they not do anything we see YET. big operation/investigation like this usually take about 2years minimum after they start with plan. do not poke the dragon with no rules and unlimited $$ to spend. be smart.

				Here&#039;s my problem:<br /><br />What kind of example are you setting for your kid if you give up your rights? People now days are so quick to fold and submit to their &quot;masters&quot; that it sickens me. If you live in a country with &#039;rights&quot;.. you need to heed this advice:<br /><br />If you don&#039;t use em&#039;, you might as well lose &#039;em.<br /><br />you better bet law makers are working to make your rights non-existent. these &quot;rights&quot; make their jobs a hell of a lot harder and make it harder to put people into the prison complexes so they can get their kickbacks.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care what your rationale is, but it&#039;s wrong. A cop&#039;s ONLY job is to make an arrest. <br /><br />Do not talk to the cops or admit a crime.

				Thank for the comments guys, that&#039;s an interesting discussion for the last discussion of my current username :)<br /><br />@12345&nbsp; -&nbsp; All is good, as mentioned, everyone has the right to agree, disagree and thats cool.<br /><br />@GUS - Well,&nbsp; there are 2 points that makes me feel uncomfortable&nbsp; with what you are saying,&nbsp; <br />1 - as you mentioned,the exact situation is not clear here. so its hard for me to explain all.<br />2- i find it shocking that you would let your family sit even 1 unneeded minute in the police station, when you can let them out in a sec, and you know you WILL NOT spend even 1 day in jail,&nbsp; as i mentioned quite a few times before. <br />two weeks later my wife is still ill from that experience, not good, take my word on this one.<br />Also, as i said before, i do have experience with such situations, i have been there before and knew how to get my best out of it -&nbsp; mean, not talk at first and than request what i want for talking, and again,&nbsp; i couldn&#039;t care less about the court, it will end as nothing more than a slap on the wrist.<br /><br />@danjohnken554 - see my previous comment, and protecting my family is a big thing from MY point of view, don&#039;t care about the court for that matter. which i did, and again, the fact im here now, say it was with some success at least.<br /><br />@flwrchlds9&nbsp; - as i said before, the non-existing secrecy of SR is not relevant, but from YOUR point of view i have those 2 options - <br />a. make up a whole story where i bough the drugs, get interrogated for hours just to find all the holes in my story i just made up and that does not match the evidence they have - and for no reason, waste some more time and energy and get nothing, since the drugs are caught anyway - court will not be avoided.<br />b. tell the real story - story matches the evidence they have, go home - also here court will not be avoided since the drugs are caught anyway.<br />what would you do?&nbsp; (both cases they do have the drugs so &quot;not talking&quot; would just waste some more time)<br /><br />@TheGoodSon - i do agree with your point of keeping your rights,&nbsp; but there is no rights issue here, keep in mind you already got busted, with drugs, with evidence, so again, same as previous comments, we have all been in the &quot;im the hero who doesn&#039;t talk place&quot;, but many years ago, when my actions affected only ME and not OTHER i care about.<br />only point matters is the bottom line (court verdict) - that wont be hard anyway.<br /><br /><br />Thanks Again for all the comments, most of them making me realize even more, that i have done the best for MY CASE at least.<br />wish that all of will avoid this type of situation and dilemma&#039;s.

				Thanks mate,<br /><br />All Cathinones and Cathinone analogs are illegal in my country except for natural Khat leafs,&nbsp; i actually also assume its more like meth-Cathinone rather than 4-MMC , check Lim&#039;s review thread i posted there a few weeks ago regarding hes cheap meph which i have no doubt is Meth-Cathinone,&nbsp; but its fun and its all i have for now, so who am i to complain? :)&nbsp; &nbsp;at this point im just thankful it arrived, i didn&#039;t get arrested and that my wife didn&#039;t mind i will use it...<br /><br />Gonna wash it down with some opiates (legal meds) before i want to sleep, <br />i actually snorted like 500mg and after that i get no effect whatsoever from snorting more, so im getting bored.

				Thanks i hope so as well,&nbsp; i feel like a complete shit for the last 2 weeks for making my wife going trough this as she be became ill from all the stress, not to recover even now... 2 weeks later, not to mention the financial implication of the lawyer and getting new electronics instead of those confiscated, and the fact that i will be interrogated again pretty soon...<br /><br />Need to think very good as a father / husband about the potential implications, just seeing my &quot;pure&quot; wife (means that never even knew about these stuff) in the police station, questioned,&nbsp; scared me for life,&nbsp; i never felt this way before,&nbsp; when i was single many years ago and had problems with the law it was pretty much nothing to me, this time i just wanted to die, cause its not only me who suffers.<br /><br />But bottom line when it will come to trial it will not be so bad at all.

I dont think they monitor my box now (private home) as they never heard of such case in past...&nbsp; <br /><br />I truely think that the smarest thing to do is to talk to my lawyer and see what he say, the reason i considered coming clean is that i will probably wont be charged at all if i will say i cant stop it, as much as they are bastards.<br /><br />Im afraid that the possibility of getting the letter (again some small amount) and running is not practical - cause in case they do monitor the mail they will arrest me way before it reaches my door,&nbsp; it will be enough of evidence for them in my case weather i pick it up or not (it wont be the first time in my country) - unless i will have some very good explanation why someone is mailing me drugs, <br /><br />Botton line for that -&nbsp; its not the punishment im scared of, as it wont be too bad, but the mess of them disturbing my life and my family, this what i want to avoid....<br /><br />Just wanted to share with the community here that i like so much, and get this off my heart, i will leave the legal part to the lawyers :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sorry to hear this.<br />I am a vendor and have a trusted&nbsp; customer who has connections with the postal service.<br />If something is wrong they can follow the package/letter from the moment it is in the country. <br />Don&#039;t ask me how, I know they can because it was done to my shipments.<br />All is registered. <br />The police is not waiting at your door...they have better (well better ?) things to do.<br />If they know you get things in the mail for sure the easiest way is just tell postal service what they need, they puss some buttons and the computers doing the rest (picking your mail out) <br />They just know the exact time and day the letter is delivered from the mail service info.<br />So much for getting it out and flush it ....no use...<br />As long as it is in your mailbox you don&#039;t own it, its not yours, anybody could have put it in or sent you.<br />What I don&#039;t get is that you asking here for what to do but...the only one who can tell you, you did not contact or spoke with yet (I think)....YOUR LAWYER<br />

				Thanks mate for the reply, as said, this thread is quite old, since than i found myself new drop point and even got some stuff sent to my house as usuall with no problem and now im high as fuck, luckly as i understood while i was interrogated - they have mo practical way to locate or track normal mail, just registered mail and packages (in my country at least) so after making some tests with drop points -&nbsp; i stopped worrying and kept on partying so far so good :)<br /><br />** i have seem to caused some confusion since i bumped this old thread - if you look at the beginning you will see that i was not busted because of the mail system but in a more traditional way - because of an evidence found at my friends house leading to a search at my house that let them find some drugs that were originated from SR ( drugs that are very rare here) , bottom line, very annoying but not a big deal... <br /><br />Peace and love!

				dude, i am sorry for your bust. Through reading most parts of the thread, i have not seen any question, for me it is the first i thought:<br /><br />If you told the pigs about TOR and SR, how didn&#039;t they force you to log into your account to see your past orders? I mean, did&nbsp; u tell them simply that it is an online marketplace? that alone,&nbsp; doesn&#039;t require a user account?<br /><br />Sounds like these 4 police man, are not even familiar with a mousepad.<br /><br />I m just curious, how ignorant they are of how an online marketplace works.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am delighted (cant find the word!) in someway that the cops admitted that this is safer than buying on streets~<br /><br /><br />Hope the best for you and your family.
