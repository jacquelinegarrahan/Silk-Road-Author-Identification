				Finalizing early. Or letting the seller draw out the resolution process possibly.

				As a vendor, I&#039;ve been scammed a few times.&nbsp; I can do one of two things. 1. argue with them and wait til sr steps in and my rating gets a hit or 2. fulfill their demands. i have been fulfilling their demands up til now. If I am 100 percent confident that they received their full order, I wont be held hostage any more. Im very careful on how i order. I have made mistakes, and the one or two times that I really did make the mistake, I was able to verify it. <br /><br />But most of the scamming is because its done out of escrow. Granted, i have seen good vendors turn scammers, but they are a very small minority. Most good vendors dont want their name ruined. but the only way i can see getting scammed in escrow is a dirty vendor sending an empty package or not sending it at all. Doesnt make much sense to me as they wont last long. But, I think we need some sort of feeback or something when it comes to buyers. Its nice to have the info that vendors know have regarding a buyer. But we still need a feedback system.<br /><br />Soon, I will be limiting orders to new buyers. the stuff that I sale is very expensive for me to purchase, so its not easy to replace an order, thats why I always do DCN and take very good care in my packaging... Still, though, overall, the scammers are a very small percentage...

				There are many ways buyers can scam vendors, and many ways vendors can scam buyers.<br /><br />However, talking about those scam methods can lead to more people using those scams. I suppose people might be able to avoid some scams that are discussed (don&#039;t finalize early, don&#039;t go out of escrow, etc). But other scams might just spread more, especially if they&#039;re not easily avoidable.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know how the &quot;resolution center&quot; handles everything, but even IF a buyer gets 25% or 50% of their money back, they&#039;ve still thrown away 75% or 50% of their money for nothing. Losing half your money for nothing is still a scam.<br /><br />Maybe the vendor is honest and the package was seized, but a buyer may still feel scammed. Or maybe the package arrived, but didn&#039;t contain what the buyer thought it would. Or maybe the quality was not what they were expecting.

				Yeah I should have said at the start apart from finalizing early...cos to me that&#039;s the same as going out of escrow, <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9994.msg94266#msg94266">Quote from: Silpheed on January 29, 2012, 05:29 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There are many ways buyers can scam vendors, and many ways vendors can scam buyers.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know how the &quot;resolution center&quot; handles everything, but even IF a buyer gets 25% or 50% of their money back, they&#039;ve still thrown away 75% or 50% of their money for nothing.
