				Contact the vendors directly if you&#039;re so scared.<br /><br />If anything SR IT probably did it just to not have to worry about dealing with the spate of incoming DDoS attacks that they likely knew would be happening once that stupid article came out.

Doesn&#039;t matter who owns Silk Road, because the original design of the system is not &#039;trust based&#039;. PGP ensures privacy of communication between vendor to customer.

				Yeah, that horribley written piece of crap &#039;article&#039;&nbsp; <br /><br />Some moron &#039;writer&#039; always trying to find a new angle on something, and that angle is always way over their heads. As children are being raped out back the governers mansion, and blown up by 30 year old US landmines in foeign countries, This &#039;reporter&#039; seems worried about a single person selling guns via a single method, ign oring the fact that in most US states, you can buy a gun much easier and cheaper. As far as europe goes, thats not a US reporters business. Just goes to show, the issues we are actually faced with are never the ones they need &#039;the people&#039; worried about.
