				I am not digging the Bitinstant worries and the taxation whenever I buy. I want to hear about Bitcopia before I use them. Let me know if they are good business people.

				brother i can tell you all about bicopia!<br /><br />So i needed to buy 950$ worth of coin wensday and i was going to use my regular dudes over at bitinstant, however i kept hearing horror story after story, so instead of using bitinstant, i tried BlueSkyTraders BUT they were sold out... SO i went with bitcopia, but they were TEMPORARILY closed because of high demand and violitile price changes, so i was emailed bitcopia every 30 minutes or so and finally because i had emailed him from 7 in the morning untill about 2pm, he kindly let me do an email purchase. He did this because it allowed him to keep the site closed, but let me do a purchase (which was extremely nice of him)<br /><br />SO i ran over to wells fargo, deposited the money, and waited. Now he managed to buy me the coins within...20 minutes, even though the prices were crazy. However, the network took forever to confirm it since everything is haywire these days....<br /><br />so...<br />.<br />by the time the coins went into my account i had about $700.... from $950, minus 7% for bitcopia fee so i lost a fair ammount, however SR didnt update it so on SR i had around $800, i quickly made my purchase and was happy.<br /><br />From now on im going with bitcopia instead of bitinstand FOR SURE<br /><br />There communcation is 10x better and hes just a pleasure to do business with<br /><br />HOPE MY STORY HELPED
