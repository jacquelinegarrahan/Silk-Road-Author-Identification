				Ok i&#039;m simply wondering how you think people manage to source the variety of drugs that they do? <br />I mean some vendors have varieties of hashish from all over the world. Are they making it themselves though bubble bags?&nbsp; Have they got contacts in either source contries (Morocco, Nepal, Spain, Nepal) made by going on holiday or perhaps contacts in Holland? It really is amazing how much of a variety if products people manage to stock.&nbsp; What do you think?

				Persistence, commitment, dedication, discipline and any other word to describe pretty much the same thing. Like HardHustle said, if you want something bad enough, you will get it. It also takes a tiny bit of luck, but luck can be enforced by fully putting your mind to it. Opportunities present themselves every now and then - you need to be there and ready to exploit them. Some, usually the first few (judgment is an important skill to accumulate over time) will likely set you back rather than help you. You&#039;ve already gotten an enormous opportunity by finding SilkRoad; a community full with intelligent bad-asses whom will help you with most things voluntarily. When you build a reputation of your own, you&#039;ll eventually be able to go along with the bigger guys, get more valuable information/contacts and whatnot. The key is to stick with what you want!

				Ok heres the real deal, but dont tell anyone else.<br /><br />Go to your nearest Mcdonalds. Order two and a half (yes a half, thats the code word) cheeseburgers, with no onions and extra sesame seeds on the bun. The guy/girl will ask if you want fries with that. You respond &quot;fries, but of course! But i want my fries SHAKEN NOT STIRRED&quot; that is the whole process.

Where i live the dealers are thick as shit, and just take each day as it comes. They&#039;re generally not well off financially but they don&#039;t seem jealous of what others have. So the theory from HardHustle above is balls.

				If you are looking to find local contacts. A bartender will be the best bet, and I don&#039;t mean the one at the redneck his bar. Pick a pub or nite club that services the younger crown 21 - early 30&#039;s. Go on a semi slow day buy a few drinks and tip well. Start talking to the bartender and let them know you are new to town and could really use a joint. They usually have a friend that sells. Start of buying small amounts them move your up in quantity and start asking for other stuff. sooner or later he will get it for you or introduce you to the next link in the chain.<br /><br />Good Luck

				Its not easy as many moving the kilos stick to a tight knit circle and many will have known each other for a lifetime.<br /><br />Aside from family, friends and workmates it is down to how much money you have. <br /><br />Even then the market is so tight that it is impossible to sell drugs without back up in many areas of the UK.<br /><br />Online is the way forward.<br /><br />The guys who make the real money are selling the kilos. Those buying an oz of coke almost always use it. They won&#039;t give their contact away to their users and I guess many in the drug scene keep their dealer to themselves as it pays to do that. <br /><br />the guys who sell kilos, they have customers they trust. Even then they use middle men to do the handover.<br /><br />Try asking around for a kilo and you will be offered it by every thief. Robbing people looking to buy is a big thing. Even going through a &#039;friend&#039; well a friend might not be that big a friend if its a kilo of coke and he can slip out 200grams and replace with whatever and reform the block.<br /><br />You might marry a girl who has a brother who is into that scene.<br /><br />The gangs bringing in a few kilos a year do not need new customers. There is a lot of mistrust and a big chance you will get your money stolen and not be able to call 999. <br /><br />Best not asking around too much either.
