				I have several forum accounts, but I made this new one to post this. I would appreciate it if a Moderator would move this to the main discussion forum. <br /><br /><br />****READ THIS ---- The following story is a recreation of a story from a guy who knew a guy, who knew a guy, who knew a guy, who knew a guy, who knew a guy, etc ;). This may or may not be based in reality. <br /><br />I have a friend, we will call him Cyle. Me and all my friends, Cyle included are in high school, it&#039;s about late &#039;2011 if I recall. We&#039;re all stoners, smoke on a regular basis, and one of us in our group was a dealer, but never had more than an ounce at a time.<br /><br />One day, out of nowhere, Cyle had a guy who was selling him QPs of weed, and more. All he would say is it his his buddy. Well we all started to buy from Cyle for some time. One day he brought some weed over to my house asking if he could weigh it out. I saw the Vac-seal bag, he opened it, weighed it, great, amazing weed.<br /><br />Later that evening, he began to let things slip out. I was the closest with Cyle out of the group, I introduced him into the group. He told me he would be going off to college soon, and then said he found this website where you can buy drugs. I didn&#039;t believe him and told him it had to be a scam. He said he wasn&#039;t sure but he did a lot of research into it so. Little did I know he had already ordered from it numerous times. He told me about it and we started discussing all the drugs we could get, how we could finally get some reliable psychedelics, if the site was legit afterall, but he was talking as if he already knew it was.<br /><br />Long story short, he moved away, visiting periodically to sell weed to kids who we went to school with, and I primarily sold to people in our old group, he left me have them so to speak. He was going through 2-3lbs a week, off SR alone, but he had moved on to Shrooms also. He would travel 2-3 hours at a time on the interstate with 2lbs of weed and a lb of shrooms on him, many times a week, for up to a year, but he never got pulled over. I said this was stupid, but he insisted he was safe. <br /><br />My first purchase was an ounce of weed that I bought with some birthday money, from the vendor Rocker. It was great. I got it for $280 and sold it for $340. I repeated this to my only customer who sold to kids we went to school with, and he moved about 5 oz a week. Eventually I was buying QP&#039;s, HPs, and LBs of weed, on a weekly basis. I lowered my price to $300/o which is the lowest in my town for this high quality, and I was making profit. We&#039;re talking almost $4000 a month and I just graduated high school, and this is just to 1 customer of mine.<br /><br /><br />Well, while I did my thing, back track to my friend. He was living the college life, I wasn&#039;t in school. He would go to all these raves and college parties, sell to college kids. From what I know, he became the #1 drug dealer at a very very large university in the Tri-State area. <br /><br />Little did I know he began to mess with Molly. I had wondered what he did exactly to get a hot-ass rave girl as a girlfriend. He had always kind of been an Ego-Maniac, and little did he know this would lead to his downfall. He was incredibly popular and well known at his university. Nobody knew he was receiving LB&#039;s of drugs through his dorm-room mail on a weekly basis. He was so well known that he had been robbed several times. I think his time at the unversity he had over $15-20k in drugs stolen from him, whether it be at gun point off campus, or some other scumbag method. This happened 8-9+ times, not in a single go. He hadn&#039;t been hanging out with anyone in our old group for a while, of which I was servicing. He would only come back into town for a few hours, make drug runs, and leave, but the talk around the town was he was still moving.<br /><br />One day it took a turn. I got a call from my friend...&quot;Cyle got busted&quot;. I look up some articles and it was something like &quot;Major Drug bust at major university etc. 4-5 Students in custody, $50,000 in cash seized, and nearly 2-LBs&nbsp; of MDMA. A long with a whole host of other drugs&quot; (Numbers have been skewed to protect identity) Most of that stuff was from him from what I know.<br /><br />He was making money. A full time college student, no criminal record, making ~$15k a month off selling weed, mdma, shrooms, acid, etc. Everything as far as I know.... and all thanks to SR. <br /><br />His only downfall was his Ego. If you wanted to buy an ounce of weed from him he would bring a jar with a LB in it and open it in front of all of your friends, without knowing who they are. He was too open with his business. <br /><br />He was looking at around 5-10 years in prison, if not more, several felonies, etc. From what I know he knew the bust was coming and he spent the entire night getting drugs out of the house, and out of the area in general. <br /><br />He moved back home, nobody wanted anything to do with him, except his girlfriend, his hot hot girlfriend. Everyone was afraid he would turn people in, or that they were bugging him, etc, this was all while he was awaiting trial. I feel I did my best to support him, but still being on SR, I had to limit my contact with him. <br /><br />One day, he&#039;s looking at big time prison, 2-3 months later he got off free with just a misdemeanor. He insisted it was due to a cop-fuck up, them not reading him his rights, or them not having the warrant when they raided his house, or them fucking up filing the case. He insisted he did not snitch. All I know is, nobody will know. I heard many reports of people getting busted at his university after he got off free(well with $10-20k in lawyer fees).... and another report of a friend I knew being shown his picture on a case file of the person who testified against him..... so who knows. Maybe it was the people who robbed him he got busted.<br /><br />He offered me molly periodically, for free, implying he had a bunch saved up. I do know he got a LOT of drugs out of his house during that short notice he had that the bust was coming, and he couldn&#039;t do shit with them. I don&#039;t think his dealing anymore... but idk.... he honestly could be.... getting off with a misdemanor.... from all those drugs and cash.<br /><br />He could be reading this. I don&#039;t think it poses any risk to him since he already got through with the case. I do know one thing though, that he was a good guy. I think he moved a little bit too quickly and he slipped up... He&#039;s a good guy and I wish this didn&#039;t happen to him... just goes to show the power of the road. <br /><br />If he sees this and wishes me to remove it, please PM me. I just wanted to share this. I figured it should do no harm now since the case has been since done with for a number of months/year.

				I&#039;ve seen similar things unrelated to SR.&nbsp; That&#039;s what happens when you turn state.&nbsp; I know dealers that are known by the police and narcotics taskforce but they are allowed to sell drugs as long as they turn in and set up people when asked to.<br /><br />Snitches are the lowest life forms.

				Me and my friends had talked about it a lot. You think somebody could get off on that amount of drugs by turning some people in? I would believe they might get it reduced... but not dropped.<br /><br />His misdemeanor was for something totally unrelated too. It could be possible that they raided his house without a warrant, and that the evidence was unlawfully obtained and had to be dismissed. It&#039;s possible.

				The only thing is he didnt have anyone above him to turn in. The Pills came from the NL I would assume, and the weed domestically.&nbsp; I just have trouble believing that someone labeled a small time kingpin could get off by turning in his customers lol.

It was the drugs, the money, and the fame that got to him. In fact this site still was never tied to him. They didnt even confiscate his computers or anything.

				He was kind of a douche sometimes but probably one of the most trustworthy people I knew. He went out of his way to help people and make them happy.<br /><br />Besides, if I was in his situation, and people had stolen thousands of dollars from me, then I would think they deserve to be busted. Only thing wrong with snitching is you&#039;re fucking somebody over, but if they fucked you over already then you&#039;re really just returning the favor. Truth is only he knows what happened.

				He may not have had anyone above him to snitch on but if people are stealing thousands of dollars worth of drugs off you, then they&#039;re probably selling enough to say they were your suppliers.

Your own business is your own business no matter what way you look at it - you take responsibility for your own actions, you don&#039;t shift it onto someone else simply because things go wrong regardless of who they are or what they have done.<br /><br />Libertas

				Ego is one of the largest downfalls for most. Everyone wants to be &quot;Mr Popular&quot; or wants to be known as a big shot. I for one can say that no one on the face of the earth knows about my joining of the SR revolution besides my partner. Not even my closest friends, family, anyone at all. This applies to when IRL dealing was my only resort as well. At that point only one person knew I had any type of illegal activity going on and they knew nothing about its magnitude or the details. Id rather have my fate in my hands rather than the hands of anyone else.<br /><br />Simplicity is key. Well at least for me, theres a huge difference between drug-dealing and running a business in my opinion.<br /><br />-XXX

				I had a similar story with a former business partner. He got busted with 15lbs in his trunk, somehow got off with probation. Shortly after a lot of big time growers up north got raided and everyone was calling him a snitch, he made a lot of enemies. He swore to me he didn&#039;t snitch them out and it was the 30k he spent on his lawyer that got him off. He found a new source and we started running together, 9 months later I got a text from his girl that he got busted again. I raced home and cleaned my house the fuck out. It was on the news that night, and the police said &quot;we believe other people are involved and expect to make more arrests in the days to come&quot;, that shit sent a chill down my spine. He called me on my throwaway phone the next morning and told me he bailed out of jail and wanted to meet up. I hung up, destroyed the phone, and never looked back. <br /><br />My paranoia was through the roof, my house was clean but I thought they were gonna come for me anyway. Anybody that has ever spent every morning waiting for the door to get kicked in by the DEA knows what I&#039;m talking about. The day never came though, and I checked on his case every few months. He was facing 6 felonies, 3 from the recent bust, and 3 from the previous one because he violated his probation. Somehow he ended up only doing one year in a low security federal prison...who knows how he pulled that off.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />When you&#039;re making 10k+ per month CASH the world can get twisted real quick. A lot of people can&#039;t keep a level head, which is why most don&#039;t last in this business.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t really think the amount matters all too much, as how you view the amount you make.<br /><br />If anyone takes one look at me they would think I&#039;m living off minimum wage, but I&#039;m making a very nice sum. Nobody is the wiser. I don&#039;t talk about money ever to anyone. I think it&#039;s better to save it up for a rainey day... nobody wants to be in the drug game for ever, at least not with their hands dirty, that shit is just stressful. <br /><br />Just have a money or time goal of when you want to stop, be very careful what you say, who you deal with, how you deal with things, and most importantly how you carry yourself. Better to end it on your own terms than on somebody elses. <br /><br />Most people aren&#039;t careful enough. They think just because they&#039;re around it all day that they can be open about it.. stupid. They should be actin as if it&#039;s even a secret to themselves, as if they don&#039;t even know.

				I got a buddy. Non SR guy. I don&#039;t do any business with him anymore but he got entrapped in a situation where he decided not to buy a qty of herb really because he thought it was shit weed and they came in anyway. They made him pose for pics with the herb&nbsp; (he should not have complied but he claims they threatened him with violence). They tried to make him turn snitch and sell the weed. He refused so they took him in and with no money his lawyers won&#039;t fight it. They got him out of doing time but he is on diversion etc... now.<br /><br />Money and the ability to not fall for coercion can go far when it comes to the law. Knowing people helps too. I was facing 11yrs and 29 for possession way way back almost 20yrs ago when I was very stupid, young and asking to get popped. A gay lawyer who knew me from the gym came in and got me out with a $100 fine and re-instated probation because he didn&#039;t want to not see me at the gym. True story. Your lawyer being pals with the prosecutor changes things if they really like you. Pretty fucked up but that is how the world works my friends.<br /><br />These days I am so low key you&#039;d never know I am a psychonaut if you saw me in a crowd. I&#039;m the typical responsible citizen pretty much with eccentric interests...

				There must be thousands who can relate to this story, either as being in that crowd of kids buying the weed, being friends with the &quot;big dealer of the school&quot;, or maybe even playing the lead role. <br /><br />I graduated from High School in 1981,(tri-state area too) and your story was so close to &#039;the way it was&#039;, substitute the word Molly which didn&#039;t exist, with say, LSD (good LSD! ;D), or perhaps Quaalude&#039;s which were all the rage back then, and it was like a documentary of my teenage years. It just blew me away!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been feeling so old lately, and that story just reached across the decades and said &quot;How ya doin?&quot;&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Probably the most entertaining forum post I&#039;ve ever read, and I&#039;ve been around here longer than this screen name. <br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />-Chip<br /><br />
