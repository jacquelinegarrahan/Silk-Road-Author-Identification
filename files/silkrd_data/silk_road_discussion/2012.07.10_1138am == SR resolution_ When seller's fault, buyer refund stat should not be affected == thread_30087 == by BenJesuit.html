				Every now and again, a seller gets overwhelmed, goes rogue, has personal issues or whatever. They fail to ship, fail to prove they shipped or what have you. <br /><br />Point is, when it&#039;s not the buyer&#039;s fault, but clearly the seller&#039;s fault, the buyer&#039;s refund rate should not be affected if SR resolution has to refund the buyer. <br /><br />SR resolution needs to have the option of marking a refund as not affecting a buyer&#039;s refund rate stat.<br /><br />A fair number of sellers having issues or being selective scammers will affect buyer stats with their shenanigans. That&#039;s not the least bit fair.

				I disagree. <br /><br />I understand what you&#039;re saying but the current system is the way to go. Sellers would get scammed too much and just leave SR all together.<br /><br />If you get refunded, there is NO penalty to the seller. Having refunds on your profile doesn&#039;t matter if you have other good transactions - sellers would never refuse an order for a refund rate 10% or lower.<br /><br />As you said, it&#039;s only &quot;Every now and again&quot; so your stats will not suffer.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				As a buyer I agree with this, as I&#039;m currently just about to go through this - through SR resolution due to a crappy ass lieing vendor who ignores all messages and marks goods as shipped but never even sends them. Obviously i&#039;m not the only one, lots of other buyers are going through resolution right now and have all had to be refunded which will impact on their stats.<br /><br />I, like many other buyers I assume, pride myself on my feedback and transaction success on SR and it really is a pain when something unexpected can ruin our stats completely due to the vendor. The vendor I&#039;m talking about and dealing with at hand is BigSkyMeds.<br /><br />BSM review thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25603.120<br /><br />Vendor account:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9469f7e85e<br /><br />The reviews and feedback speak for itself... I&#039;m only a couple of days away from entering resolution. This sucks. Not fair.&nbsp; :(

				Though, I mean really, when it&#039;s CLEARLY not the buyer&#039;s fault, why should the buyer have to take a ding?<br /><br />The reverse scam buyers wouldn&#039;t be able to get around this since many sellers use DCN to prove shipping. But I&#039;m talking about those bad sellers whose feedback also reflects that others haven&#039;t been receiving what they ordered. <br /><br />But your point is taken in that no seller would refuse a buyer with under 10% refund rate. Mine is a 0% and I&#039;d like it to stay that way.

				Though, sellers wouldn&#039;t lose protection if a system were revised in this way. Think about it. <br /><br />If a seller has been getting bad reviews, multiple complaints from buyers on the forum and to SR support and multiple orders from multiple buyers having to go through resolution, it stands to reason that it clearly something is wrong with the seller. Therefore under those circumstances, the buyers wouldn&#039;t and shouldn&#039;t have to take a ding on their refund rate. <br /><br />Good sellers would have nothing to worry about. It&#039;s not like a bunch of buyers are going to get together and target a seller with false reverse scams. <br /><br />This system can be improved without sellers having to worry about a loss of protection. The buyers shouldn&#039;t have to bear the consequences of a seller with issues.

				In clear cut cases, where numerous reputable buyers are reporting the same problem and the vendor is acting like a cunt, I agree. <br /><br />If a reputable seller has an order that for whatever reason gets marked as not arriving, that should still go on to the buyers refund rate. Now the vendor very well may be SSing but there is not enough evidence of that to not give them the benefit of the doubt, especially if their other orders are going through correctly.<br /><br />But when someone is having repeated problems and numerous respectable people are reporting the same thing.. there&#039;s absolutely no reason why their refund rate should be affected because some piece of shit decided the workload was too much and he&#039;d start scamming.

I asked for a refund instead but he hasn&#039;t be on since Sunday night. Said he&#039;s suffered a family tragedy which may be the case. But he should post that on his seller profile and immediately refund all buyers with orders that haven&#039;t shipped.

				Same deal with same vendor for me.&nbsp; It may not seem like a big deal to someone with a large amount of purchases, but if you don&#039;t have many it really will hurt your stats.&nbsp; I guess we can always explain, but the buyer stats are a big deal here.&nbsp; The stats are actually all everyone goes by so i agree when a vendor screws up it shouldn&#039;t hurt the buyer.&nbsp; The BigSkyMeds issue we all have in common has nothing to do with the buyers, but all of our stats will take a hit.&nbsp; That sucks!

				Yeah but the truth is--your refund rate will go down on its own.&nbsp; And if you politely and respectfully explain to a future vendor why your refund rate is temporarily high, they will most likely take your order, if they are established and respectable.<br /><br />Also, there are some vendors who will refund you outside of escrow if you finalize.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t do this for most vendors, but respected vendors I would trust enough to not screw me over.&nbsp; I did this once, and it has no effect on your stats, except by adding another successful transaction to them (even though it really wasn&#039;t).&nbsp;

				I fully agree that when it&#039;s patently obvious that a seller has gone off the rails, that people who have placed an order with them and have their funds in Escrow should just get their money back, plain and simple.<br /><br />But the problem with that is that it would take manpower and active decision making by the people than run SR and I just don&#039;t know that they have the resources.<br /><br />Changes need to be made though.

				Neither did my stats get affected. But even if it did, considering the number of transactions I have, it would be less than 1%. refund rate due to this BSM fiasco. So I guess it doesn&#039;t register until you break the 1% threshold.&nbsp;

				I received my refund from the BigSky deal too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have very many purchases and this would have been a great deal more than 1% for me, but i&#039;m still showing 0% refunds.&nbsp; Thanks Silk Road.&nbsp; I think our thoughts on this forum made sense to admin and they listened to everyone&#039;s comments.&nbsp; Either that or there is a several day delay until it shows up, but i don&#039;t think that is the case.&nbsp; I think they realized this wasn&#039;t our fault and they didn&#039;t ding our stats for it.&nbsp; Awesome!
