				Hello this is a message to vendors of powdered substances like MDMA,Coke, Dmt, ETC<br /><br />Im sure many buyers (like me)of these substances would appreciate it, that when you vaccum seal the drugs, if you could add a real bag for the last bag, instead of a vaccum bag.&nbsp; That way we don&#039;t have to dig every little bit of powder out of the vaccum bag and put it into a real bag.&nbsp; This way a lot less product will be lost, and we don&#039;t have to attempt to scrape the side of the vaccum bag.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there is any shipping issues doing this but if there is please let me know.

				This isn&#039;t common practice? I always use a little baggie as the first layer of packaging, and then double vacuum seal to provide 3 levels of enclosure, regardless of what I ship. Those vacuum bags are too textured inside. You would loose a bunch of product in those little vacuum bag pockets. Well that&#039;s my way of doing things. And of curse a label on the inner baggie for what it is. Very useful for multiple item orders. <br />It always surprises me when buyers request something like this, it just seems like common sense. But then again, I don&#039;t order much from the road and when I do it&#039;s to check my competition, see how they pack and test their product compared to mine. And then steal whatever they&#039;re doing that work/looks better than what I&#039;m doing.<br /><br />MJMuse

Vendor forgot to vacuum seal it!!! Just using at least 1 more bag would have at least prevented shit falling out, however, I find even though there is so called &quot;standards&quot; when committing to being a vendor on SR, most of the time vendors don&#039;t follow these anyway. I believe this all leads back to the feedback/rating system which needs to be improvised/improved. Just my opinion :)

				while i agree it has to be correctly vacc-ed/air purged, i disagree a powder should be in a drug baggie then outer sealed, i like to receive my envelopes totally flat, with a dope baggie you can feel the zipper, not good at all imo, im happy to open a vac with total care and never loose a grain, and scraping for the remainder has never been a issue for me either.<br /><br />Im happy for my seller to sent it discreet and flat with out a zipper bag please, and would consider down grading a rating if the envelope felt dodgy.

				I can see both sides of this position. I wouldn&#039;t mind only the vacuum bag if it helped my package in the stealth department.<br />So long as I didn&#039;t lose more than .1 g in the scraping. From what I read vendors often overweigh their powders for scale discrepancy and such.<br /><br />I know from past experience that getting all of your goodies out of even a simple dope bag can be a pain, although I love going for the numb-y&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />The feedback system has been brought up though, and I agree that it could use some more thought. Though I don&#039;t know how I would change it.<br />A little bit more detail could really go a long way as far as helpful and informative feedback. <br />And yeah, a page full of &quot;FE for trusted shipper&quot; doesn&#039;t help.

More vendors need to take some of their profits and order from their competitors to get a better understanding of packing techniques.

And with a little imagination you can start mixing and matching methods for even more stealth techniques. If nothing else, I&#039;ve discovered that my packing is better than 90% of the methods currently in use and the time and effort needed to get to 100% would be too time consuming with my current order load and slow down order processing and shipping.<br /><br />MJMuse

				It helps to know people who work for Canada Post and the Canadian Border Services Agency that have no idea what I really do.

				Glad someone mentioned this. The textured vac seal bags are painful to scrape / tap / licks drugs from. It&#039;s only happened to me twice and I lost up to 0.1g which is a LOT whatever you&#039;re buying. Especially if you paying a premium because of quality or location. I didn&#039;t give the vendors negative feedback but if it happens again I&#039;ll bring it up with the vendor. Not cool guys.&nbsp; Thanks so much OP.

				Perhaps you should buy a bit more then whatever size you are so .1 ends up not really mattering. I suppose if you are buying 1g at a time but thats firstly the most expensive way to buy it, and it&#039;s not like it has no shelf life. Or obviously you could sell your overage at a markup that covers the expense of your portion like some people do. Most of the better vendors here (like ivory) usually are pretty good on overage so unless you are getting less than 1g (and most are probably more like 1.1-1.2) then I don&#039;t see what you have to complain about, not like it&#039;s hard to hang on to a few small baggies from various other things to use for it.

				I&#039;ve made a couple of purchases now and noticed a couple of differences in how each seller packages. <br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that the MDMA vendor triple vac sealed where as the mcat vendor only single sealed. I was disappointed by this and could actually smell some of the mcat through the packaging.
