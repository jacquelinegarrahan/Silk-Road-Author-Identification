				in one week it will be a full year i have been a sr buyer.&nbsp; I remember how many hours i invested, reading up on tor, bitcoins, and all levels of security. spending 2 weeks throughout this forums and then making a small purchase (kara-1 gram molly, I was off to a great start) all my research on vendors, writing them out as a check list. i was ambitious, but scared as FUCK.&nbsp; the moment it arrived. that was it, the addiction to the site began.&nbsp; I def could have wrote this better, using more imagery and metaphors and shit, but i am too lazy to and hope someone would do that in a follow up post for me in your experience.<br /><br />132 transactioins later, i am still a pussy. but just buy a lot larger orders. Crazy all that has happened in 1 year, all the drugs and SR maintenance, and buyer/seller scammers, and vendors collapses and rises, and bitcoin stuff and fake LE stuff, and other stuff-stuff.<br /><br />I wish i could throw a party for all you assholes in celebration of my one year anniversary here, but fuck you guys, you probably dont give a shit. me neither.<br /><br />nazi tits

				Thanks mate, fuck you too. Good job on the journey :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve made 2 successful transactions so far, and was filled with confidence, and the orders that are in transit are promising too... However, this last down-time and scare has kind of gotten me a bit worried about the whole thing, and my confidence is slowly slipping away... I hope to Christ it all gets back to normal.<br /><br />Fingers crossed<br /><br />Keep it up<br /><br />Just how many failed orders have there been for you? My first ever buy was a scam from that cunt Enter the Matrix ages ago
