				I mean, I know which product I&#039;d like to order, and the vendor seems to be back up and running. My bitcoins are in my non-SR wallet waiting to transfer and get things going, but I just don&#039;t know if I want to pull the trigger just yet. Has anyone taken the plunge yet? Site seems extremely fast and smooth now

				It depends on what you want to order and if u are willing to risk.&nbsp; I did not want to take a risk with SR yet so I ordered my drugs from the a SR vendor an a one of the other sites that is not having any dos attacks.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you place an order and the site gets ddos attacked again and the btc falls your fucked.&nbsp; <br /><br />If SR can run for a few days un affected i willbw getting an oz of molly Friday.&nbsp; I needed some cola super bad ,( need it for work), and couldn&#039;t risk it so i went else where but i will be back.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the response my friend... I&#039;m thinking I&#039;ll make a &quot;test run&quot; with a vendor who does Express USPS shipping, that&#039;ll be a quick in-and-out transaction (small in quantity of course), I&#039;ll report back, but I&#039;m starting to think we&#039;re going to be okay :)

				I made a small purchase from a trusted vendor (Sun-Wu), and a new customer placed an order from me. Ive already processed the order and sent it out, hopefully I&#039;ll see &quot;in transit&quot; from Sun-Wu soon. Then i can breath again :)

				Have patience.&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything works&nbsp; &nbsp;Its just like a month ago.. . a little slow, time outs, etc. . . .<br /><br />I have a feeling there is a lot of coders accessing SR without the PHP pages with scripts, bots, or whatever. .&nbsp; Ever hear of the warweed bot/script&nbsp; &nbsp;Designed for SR so vendors can change/update listings without actually loading each page up?<br /><br />Anyway, there is a lot going on and experimenting too I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;All this adds up to &#039;regular&#039; traffic for this place.<br /><br />A DDOS on this site was possible by even just a small attack.&nbsp; It was already slow and vulnerable and it just took a bit to&nbsp; push it over the edge.<br /><br />I think DPRs fix was simply to buy more bandwidth so the attack wasn&#039;t as effective as it was on a smaller pipe.&nbsp; At some point though, an attacker will get more resources and try again.&nbsp; And DPR can then buy more connections/redundancy or whatever it is he&#039;s doing.&nbsp; I think the issues is resolved and it really just comes down to budgeting for attacks.<br />&nbsp;

				I managed to get an order placed yesterday evening, and it was even promptly marked as &quot;in transit,&quot; so i imagine things are going back to business as usual.&nbsp; In fact, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if today&#039;s timeouts, etc. are just a function of so many people trying to get it at once...
