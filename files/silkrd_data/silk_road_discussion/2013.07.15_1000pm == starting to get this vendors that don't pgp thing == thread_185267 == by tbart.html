				contacted one of the dealers on here, there was a long thread on his product, seemed decent enough guy with lots of feedback. Exchanged a couple of emails, 2nd one told him was still going thru the setting up wallet thing and sourcing bitcoins but i&#039;d be back in a couple of days to order<br /><br />two days later i contacted him, that i was ready to place the order &amp; asking if we could go gpg4usb as at this point i&#039;d like to encrypt - DON&#039;T EVEN GET A FUCKING RESPONSE - sent him a 2nd email couple days later asking him if he got the last email - STILL HAVEN&#039;T HEARD BACK. And he&#039;s on this site almost daily ??????<br /><br />what is it with these guys?

				Multiple possibilities...lazy, stupid, incompetent, or just plain retarded. <br /><br />Avoid them, there are millions of other vendors out there that there is no need to deal with vendors without PGP.

				There are a ton of big vendors that do not PGP...most say that it is too time consuming for them.&nbsp; While that is totally their opinion, it seems you have a good security ethic.&nbsp; Do not order if they don&#039;t use PGP.&nbsp; Simple as that man.

				the sad part is, i had a hunch he wasn&#039;t a pgp kind of guy (older guy, in the big thread he said he&#039;d been doing this 30 years, ie breeding maryjane strains) but i was prepared for that if he&#039;d only have responded - i had enough sense for the guy that if he didn&#039;t pgp, i was willing to just mail him cash (yeah i know, but it wouldn&#039;t have been $100) and just trust him to ship, provided he had a friend or po box or someplace to mail the money to. If he didn&#039;t ship or money got lost in the mail, i was prepared to forget it. The benefit to me was not having to frigging screw with the learning curves on localbitcoins.com. wallets, electrum installed on Tails USB etc<br /><br />but to shut down comm because someone asks to go pgp - fuck him, retarded at best<br /><br />

Getting bitcoins is pretty easy. Its easier than using GPG imo.

				you may have a point - been doing some research this morning on the link Just Chipper gave on bitaddress.org and blockchain.info and i&#039;m sitting at the blockchain web to create an acct and they&#039;re asking &quot;already a bitcoin user?&quot; import your wallet and i have no clue - i installed electrum on tails usb, so does that mean i should import an address from there --- wtf??? - <br /><br />i was asking, looking for an answer, just trying to give a glimpse of how &quot;greek&quot; this stuff is to someone who hasn&#039;t used it - there should be a tutorial &quot;bitcoin wallets for dummy dummies&quot;<br /><br />rant switch off, back to head scratching and deciphering the techno lingo

				i don&#039;t think it&#039;s the time in encrypting/decrypting - i suspect it&#039;s the initial effort to learn the encryption software - i&#039;m an old fart, and believe me when i say a lot of this stuff is greek (and even greek with a heavy creole or cajun accent thrown in) for the older gen - learning gpg4usb took me a couple of hours and i still hadn&#039;t figured it out - there were blank spots in all the tutorials or they seem to assume you know the logic before you&#039;ve learned it - it wasn&#039;t till rustykoin took a few minutes and typed out a simple &quot;paint by the numbers&quot; instruction for me AND threw in the reason for a public &amp; a private key that it made sense and worked<br /><br />suspect their reticence is a factor of fear of the &quot;unknown&quot; and laziness<br /><br />but regardless, i&#039;m more than a little hesitant to communicate via what boils down to an electronic version of a postcard

But that&#039;s not true to say it doesn&#039;t slow you down. When you&#039;re getting dozens (or more) messages at a time it&#039;s a huge interruption in workflow to be copying and pasting and decrypting. Now, I don&#039;t think that the time hassle is a valid excuse to justify endangering yourself and others. But PGP encryption is not a seamless process. We need better tools.

				I don&#039;t think that we need new tools. The ones available are already very sophisticated in my opinion and are easy-to-use.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t use PGP, you should not even think about trading illegal goods over the internet. If you can&#039;t be bothered to use PGP, you should be thrown out of the community. I don&#039;t say that the act of de- and encryption doesn&#039;t disturb the workflow. But it is simply careless not to use such an easy, fast method to make information worthless for a third party (that&#039;s what it basically does).<br /><br />Same tip as most people gave here, don&#039;t make business with vendors that either can&#039;t or won&#039;t use PGP. It&#039;s just not worth it.<br /><br />

				If a vendor can&#039;t learn PGP I begin to question all aspects of their operation.I watched a video on youtube and had it down no problem.I&#039;ve wanted to order from a H vendor for a awhile but just can&#039;t force myself to use privnote.This same vendor said he was going to get PGP and actually had his key up for like 5min then it was down again,guess he didn&#039;t grasp it.....I went elsewhere
