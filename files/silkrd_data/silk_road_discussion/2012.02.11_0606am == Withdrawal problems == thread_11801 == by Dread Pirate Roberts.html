				UPDATE 2/14/2012 2:05 pm UTC: Withdrawals are now flowing again.&nbsp; Thank you everyone for your patience throughout this process.&nbsp; As always, if you have any grievance at all, I completely understand.&nbsp; I and the rest of the support staff are here to make it right.&nbsp; Please just let us know.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/14/2012 1:08 pm UTC: The bitcoin exchange rate just dropped about a buck, so we will be adding 15% to all of the current pending withdrawals to cover it.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/14/2012 6:37 am UTC:&nbsp; We are looking at up to 24 more hours until withdrawals can start flowing again.&nbsp; There is a chance it will be ready sooner, but I can&#039;t guarantee it.&nbsp; Really sorry, but I think we&#039;ll be good to go after this.<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; Ok, we are still having problems.&nbsp; I am going to roll back the withdrawal system to a configuration known to work and re-evaluate the whole thing.&nbsp; You can still withdrawal right now, but there is going to be a delay of several hours before the withdrawal is made.&nbsp; If you made a withdrawal any time from around 10pm feb 13th UTC until now, your withdrawal is queued and will be processed, but it&#039;s going to be a few hours at least.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep this thread updated with progress.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Hey gang,<br /><br />We&#039;ve been having problems with some user&#039;s withdrawals the past week or so where their accounts were debited, but the actual Bitcoin transfer was never broadcast to the Bitcoin network.&nbsp; It took some figuring out, but I think we finally have it fixed.&nbsp; Please double check that your withdrawals over the past week or so made it out.&nbsp; If you find any that weren&#039;t sent, but your account was debited, please message support via the contact us link on the main site with the amount and time of the withdrawal.&nbsp; So sorry for the trouble this has caused everyone, especially the vendors that were depending on those funds to re-stock.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJPNgVIAAoJEAIiQjtnt/ol4BQIANnHE5AQLH1eKmzgKPvpIPpD<br />C/WVpTi9hnoOINedTCHVTnSQFvH039aOjXc8wJ6PnII90+z0hajxOwKu+9XL2XXA<br />bCwOOpu8g15jm9LDCOFGSv9+jgoa9h69GZpMfEdEXs9DfnJ2RiykKwI793T1HqrS<br />0QRbfWOSYe6NC5huPAn2BXte5kE2wff5CB1/9puvXD+6w7khI2eFpZtAByhayrNP<br />XAdsjYWH0g8Uaf+z8f8osyTaMls58nzq78iQdwpnbz4KbHlx1PmlUGtn1/2PfW1w<br />bPRq3lVIDV6go7jucrRZFSvELaNPm4prrM2PqoznKN0mJ2OlP7Noiqz7IxhteOY=<br />=SXlH<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

So it makes sense to not only change his name but disassociate the two accounts.
