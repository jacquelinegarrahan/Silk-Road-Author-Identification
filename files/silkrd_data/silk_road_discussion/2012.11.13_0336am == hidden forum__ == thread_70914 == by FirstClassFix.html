				I opened up the forum webpage and I hadnt signed on yet and I went into &#039;SR discussion&#039; and I saw a topic started by DPR, it said the site is &#039;back up and running&#039; so I clicked on it and it came back with you dont have permission, so I signed in and I cant find it, its not there at all, I even went to DPRs profile and went to his previous post and saw nothing, im pretty sure I wasnt hallucinating, I went to the site and got the &#039;down for maintenance&#039; page.. so my real question is..&nbsp; is my account on here under privileged because i dont have a certain amount of posts? or something like this? BTW this isnt a complaint about the site being down, im patient.&nbsp; Im just curious about the forum

				don&#039;t mean to stir shit up but about 3hrs ago i saw a post titled &quot;i took down your beloved sr&quot; By some guy named fez... anyways he said dpr would be making a statement before midnight eastern time blah blah blah, thats not the weird thing to me, the weird thing is when i came back to reload that thread i came up with this message instead...&quot;The topic or board you are looking for appears to be either missing or off limits to you.&quot; Just wondering if there was something to his post?<br />Here was the original link to that thread...<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70891.0<br /><br /><br />MMM

				I believe that is what happens to a thread that gets &#039;deleted&#039; by the mods. I don&#039;t think they actually delete it, but rather move it to a place only they can access.

				The threads aren&#039;t there because the mods deleted it. They think it&#039;s in your best interest to regulate what you read. It happens way more than you think, and I think it&#039;s fucking bullshit, but who am I? Personally, I thought the thread stating that SR was back up and running was fucking hilarious, especially considering the current situation! A little humor to break up all the hostility. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure this thread will likely be deleted soon as well. Just watch and see.
