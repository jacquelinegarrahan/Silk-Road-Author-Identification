				Thanks guys. Iv been blessed on SR, Everytime I have made a Order i always end up picking vendors that just go above and beyond to make me happy, which does not take much, all i want is good product and for it to be deliverd in a reasonable amount of time and even though iv only made 8 order and spent nice chunk in them, almost everytime iv gotton a great deal.. I just fell its right to help someone out if he is lacking the few bucks needed for a transaction, we are all good grown Men and Women here and we are like a Family, So why not help the next Man.Women when in need? Now i could not loan 2 or more full coins unless it was promised to be paid back and with that amount i would hate to do it but i would have to charge interest. But if i have left over money im doing nothing with then by all means Im happy to help someone get their drugs, Just so long as they Honor that they will pass on the good Karma to someone else one day.. Thanks guys for the kind words..
