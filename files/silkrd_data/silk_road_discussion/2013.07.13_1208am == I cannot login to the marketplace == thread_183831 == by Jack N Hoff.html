				Yep, no matter what, you just get a 3 digit captcha. Tried every trick in the book. <br /><br />It&#039;ll be fixed soon I&#039;m sure. <br /><br />But it might be an indication of new feature(s) being implemented. <br /><br /><br />EDIT: It&#039;s back to operational status!

				Here&#039;s a work around for the next time the captcha gets screwed up<br /><br />Install these two add ons:<br /><br />https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-exporter/<br /><br />https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-importer/<br /><br />You can install them in Tor Browser just fine. Login to the market and use the first add-on to export your the cookie to a text file. I believe it expires after 2 weeks, so you&#039;ll have to do it every two weeks. Then if the captcha is screwed up, use the second add-on to import your login cookie.<br /><br />Works like a charm. :)<br />
