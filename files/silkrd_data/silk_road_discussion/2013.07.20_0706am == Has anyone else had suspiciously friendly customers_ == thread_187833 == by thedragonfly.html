				I just feel that one or two of my customers has been disproportionately personable and questioning... asking the best ways to go about finding a supplier to start vending, or asking what your best idea was to cash bitcoins out into the real world....easily searchable stuff.... Has this happened to anyone else?

				Probably just some newbies. Ignore them and state on your vendor page that you only read order related messages. I recently saw a vendor who wrote he is no tourist guide. Made me smile :D

				Many of my customers are friendly and I am suspicious of all of them.<br /><br />Asking the best ways to buy or sell coins anonymously is pretty common and I don&#039;t really think the answer is easy to look up. I&#039;m not so sure there even is a good answer a lot of the time. Not only is it hard to find good answers, I agree asking me (or any vendor) is not really a cool thing to do.

				I am a bit of an over friendly customer, but that&#039;s because I don&#039;t have a lot of orders, so when I make an order I send a message along the lines of &quot;Just wanted to say hi since it&#039;s my first order from you&quot; and so on.&nbsp; I like to establish a positive communication in case either of us end up having concerns.&nbsp; I hope it doesn&#039;t make me seem suspicious.

				I think you need to distinguish between customers being friendly and customers asking for unrelated things.<br />Do friendly customers who are nice to you and send one or the other nice message to make a personal connection annoy you? If the answer is yes, you shouldn&#039;t be in the service business. Of course not every customer wants to establish such a connection but most people, especially new SR users want to establish a positive connection with somebody they are about to trust with a big chunk of their money and possible jail time.<br />Customers who are asking about deal unrelated things can be simply redirected to different places in a polite way where they can find answers.<br />While SR has a great market and offers many possibilities I sometimes feel like some people don&#039;t even know the first things about business and customer relations, no offense I am mostly talking about users in other threads.

				Thanks for the insight everyone. I just had one of those &quot;this suddenly doesn&#039;t feel right&quot; moments and thought I&#039;d ask and see if that happens to anyone else. Who knows, LE could be casually attempting to gain info through buying product and sending overtly friendly messages. But I think most of you are right.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s never wrong to be suspicious of something, as long as it&#039;s not security-detrimental paranoia.

				Being a friendly buyer and relatively noob to btc and sr, I still don&#039;t rely on vendors to answer my questions not pertaining to a specific order. The amount of research I did before my first purchase was around 100+ hours. The only questions I ask the vendor are mostly can I escrow? I don&#039;t buy from a vendor that I can&#039;t find information about shipping times, stealth, product quality and overall experiences from their ratings or forum. <br /><br />I&#039;m friendly because I genuinely believe everyone on here is either trying to make money, trying to party, or both, just like me. Plausible deniablity - I don&#039;t want to know specifics about your operation. <br /><br />Forums, terms of service, and feedback are the places to find answers to buyers questions. I don&#039;t want the vendor spending time answer noob questions when he could be concentrating on getting product out the proverbial door.

				It&#039;s funny you posted this topic/question because I have PM&#039;d vendors friendly conversation just to let them know I was a good person who just wanted a steady and reliable connection, and wasn&#039;t out to f*** anyone over. Every time I have done so, I thought to myself &quot;I hope they don&#039;t get suspicious because I&#039;m being friendly&quot;. I have only made a couple purchases to date, and with the same vendor. I sent him a personable message before I ordered from him, and he sent me a message back that simply said he was reliable and a good businessman and a good person as well. That made me feel really comfortable, and is one of main reasons I chose to order from him. I agree with everyone else who says that buyers shouldn&#039;t be asking you direct questions about how you operate unless it pertains to their order, and is something they NEED to know. I guess what I&#039;m saying is that if the message is just simply aimed at getting a feel for you as a vendor/person then it&#039;s probably in your best interest to message back with some comforting words, otherwise you should just ignore them. Also, being clear about what kind of messages you will respond to and not respond to on your vendor page should weed out some of the B.S.

				most of my customers are pretty friendly to be honest, and plenty message me just to say thanks or let me know they had a good time etc. im more than happy to reply to these messages, and consider it part of the service really. but any in depth questions about me or my operation etc will be ignored. anyone with half a brain knows whats acceptable and what isnt round here!<br /><br />as for having good/bad customers, i think it depends on what you&#039;re selling. most psychonauts are good as gold!

				I guess I should have clarified when I started the thread:<br /><br />I had a customer (very friendly and cordial) over the course of about a dozen messages transition from simple friendly questions about my listings (Potassium Cyanide) to questions about where to find product and how to find contacts to start vending product (not cyanide but other drugs) and after one or two very specific and in-depth questions my suspicion meter went off and I just ended contact with the buyer in a quick professional manner.<br /><br />No offense to the buyer if they read this. I am not suggesting you have some deviant purpose (or LE-related) but it just struck me as very odd, which is why I started this thread. <br /><br />I was curious if any other vendors had buyer contact that made them feel as if they had been targeted for information in some way.

The religious aspect of this dilemma is used by the vampires to leverage the political process to keep the status quo.

				Hey, I&#039;d love to start a discussion in the philosophy section about this :)<br /><br />back to topic:<br /><br />I am also a very friendly buyer. Still I know where the lines are and I try not to cross them. I don&#039;t want vendors to be my new besties4life. I simply believe in positive communication, it&#039;s just nice to smile when you read a few lines from your vendor. And I rarely smile if it&#039;s just about business. Why not add some positivity to the moment?<br />There&#039;s a difference between being (overly) friendly and what your customers did. Asking such questions is simply not appropriate. Everyone who is serious about Silk Road would know that. So I think you made the right decision to stop contact, but I would have written them an explaination... <br /><br />I don&#039;t think that LE would communicate with a vendor, at least not until they received the order. They would know it arises suspicion

				Its called kids on SR.&nbsp; I rarely find the need to msg a vendor before a purchase. It feels wrong to waste their time and its the main reason I&#039;m not a vendor, apparently people bug you 24/7 with pointless banter they feel entitled to.<br /><br />

I don&#039;t mind the occasional bit of banter, in fact, I try to make a habit of it unless we are bogged down with a particularly heavy load that day. We have one rule among all of us that negativity has no home in our business. It does suck when you get the occasional asshole, but killing them with kindness tends to disarm even the worst ones.
