				I don&#039;t think it is the vendors that need to adjust anything but SR itself is slow to adjust to the weighted BTC value.&nbsp; I for one can be patient and I enjoy logging in and having my currency set to USD and seeing it&#039;s $5 higher every day.

				As a vendor I&#039;m not even paying attention to that, actually.. I have everything set in USD and simply trust the system for going along with any kind of BTC fluctuations. Don&#039;t most vendors do this? Would be an enormous waste of time if you had to keep an eye on the BTC values along with the 100 other things you&#039;ve got to do as a vendor, if you asked me. So maybe it&#039;s just SR being slow indeed. Sorry lol..

				I never knew it was SR&#039;s function itself, sorry about that then :P. Guess I&#039;m just a bit annoyed as I&#039;ve cut myself short a tab of acid since this morning by a few stupid coins

				Yeah it stinks being short.&nbsp; How did you end up a few coins short though?&nbsp; Most of the time I overcalculate just for this case and even if I undercalculated I would only be 1 BTC short max.<br /><br />If you want you can take a chance you may be able to wait it out and see BTC to keep rising until you can purchase.&nbsp; Not sure where the drop off point will be when 1 BTC starts to go back down to ~4 USD is, but it may keep climbing for a little while.
