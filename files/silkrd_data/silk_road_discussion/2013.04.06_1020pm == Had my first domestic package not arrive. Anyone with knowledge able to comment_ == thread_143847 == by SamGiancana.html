				Huh, perhaps they actually wrote return to sender on it and sent it back. :P<br /><br />I&#039;d get in contact with the buyer, that&#039;s all you can do really.&nbsp; Or stake out the return address and see if its crawling with cops!

				I would imagine that this is about that thread last week. OP must be a bit new to the being able to update a thread thing. Seems like paranoia wins on this. Probably something like not being able to read the destination. MAYBE it has something to do with not enough postage paid? I am not familiar with that aspect. I wouldn&#039;t kick back in my recliner just yet though.&nbsp; 8)
