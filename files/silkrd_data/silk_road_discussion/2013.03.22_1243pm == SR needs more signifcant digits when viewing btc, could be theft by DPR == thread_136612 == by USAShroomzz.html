				So now that btc is skyhigh we DEFINITELY need more than 2 significant digits when viewing btc since even .001btc is valuable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since there is no record with the SR system of anything past 2 digits how can we know that DPR just isn&#039;t skimming off those extra bits (like the movie office space)?&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope DPR is honest and doesn&#039;t skim, but he is a pirate.<br /><br />

				Arrrrrrrr!!!<br /><br />First, SR definitely does hold more digits. About half the time if you try to send money you may get denied for insufficient funds because of rounding. So say you have &quot;1 BTC&quot; in your account, you could send 1 BTC and be given an insufficient funds error because your actual value is .995 BTC. But you could successfully send .99BTC. So SR is tracking that info. I&#039;d agree on a motion to add a 3rd digit to visibility though given how high the BTC is going.<br /><br />The other thing I&#039;ve noticed is (for vendors) when buyers finalize transactions, the conversion rate is always a little bit off (higher than the BTC value) so we end up getting less coins than were hedged. It&#039;s usually between .25-.5BTC difference. Vendors can divide the transaction total from the transaction history by the actual amount of the withdrawn bitcoins for each transaction and you&#039;ll see what I mean. When the BTC is moving upwards it&#039;s not a big deal at all, but downwards or flat momentum and you get hit with the difference. With the BTC having so much momentum these last few days you&#039;d have to catch it right when a transaction finalizes to be able to calc the difference accurately.<br /><br />Maybe SR is just pulling their own BTC value from a different exchange not listed here though: http://www.bitcoincharts.com/markets/ - in which case it&#039;s a site-wide problem because everyone is being charged a higher BTC value than it actually is. Where does SR pull their current value from? Is there anywhere we can view it?<br /><br />Headline is a little misleading, not sure I would call this stealing as this is new territory for the BTC :)

				I doubt there is any crooked intention behind this. It wasn&#039;t too long ago that BTC were around 10 bucks each, like, in December. <br /><br />So, the fact that they are now so high makes unexpected changes to how we view them necessary. Smart of you to catch this.

				I&#039;m pretty sure I remember reading that when coins go to the tumbler everything beyond two decimal places is lost to the tumbler.&nbsp; Probably not as significant when coins were 10$ or less.r

				It would be great if we could get confirmation on @matosago claim about the tumbler removing anything sig digits after 2... Seems unlikely in my opinion but it&#039;s best to get it confirmed.

				Theres a lot of details that need going over on the road but give it time, i&#039;m sure security is their key priority and what with all the media attention i bet the majority of the time is spent on security. I do agree this is something thats needed, but i&#039;d much rather SR doesnt get shut down&nbsp; :D

				the precision is in there, just not visible - annoying but a simple workaround is trial and error; my account was showing 0.01 which i wanted to get out but kept getting &#039;insufficient funds&#039;, tried 0.009, 0.008, 0.007 and bingo, its coming my way :) i can&#039;t really see SR or DPR skimming accounts for breadcrumbs when they&#039;re making so much money already - it is their business smart that keeps this place going ;)

				It&#039;s not about skimming or trust or suspicion, it&#039;s simply about accuracy and transparency.&nbsp; I just want to know how many BtC fractions I have in my account. Mathematically BtC will only become more valuable as time goes by, they are predetermined to deflate not inflate, so as long as they&#039;re being used they will be worth something.

				I&#039;m kind of on the side of pushing out to the full 8 digits, just because I&#039;m broke most of the time, and every little bit helps.&nbsp; But, as a former LEO, I can tell you that specificity can kill you in the courtroom.&nbsp; If you sent 1.85647362BTC from the address you funded through bitinstant, and within an hour, that address transferred 1.85647362BTC to the Road, well, that&#039;s pretty convincing evidence.&nbsp; So, I like the specificity, but definitely route your coins through different addresses.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to spend the money hiding behind proxies, definitely use a laundry service.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth what it costs.

				Given the exchange rates of&nbsp; BTC it ould certainly be best to implement full resolution now.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure the current implementation worked out fine when btc was at us$5, but at $70 we are seeing ronding differences. These are not problematic right now (under 1%) but that may change quicly when the bank accounts on cyprus become accessible again. <br /><br />

Bitcoin is divisible be 8 decimal places e.g. 1.00000000. I see no reason why these decimals cant be displayed. It will HAVE too if a bitcoin is worth thousands in the future for example. I&#039;m all for it. Quite often i have 0.1 left over from purchases and cant be arsed with multiple attempts at withdrawing it.
