				Hey SR forum!<br /><br />I have to say I&#039;m a little ecstatic and nervous. Ok, here&#039;s the back-story: I&#039;ve been lurking through the forums for many months as a guest... lots and lots of reading. Researching, watching, but never actively participating in anything. I followed the usual steps in that time -&nbsp; getting a USB drive, making it bootable, encrypting with TrueCrypt (dual layered encryption of course!), getting TOR, reading up on Bitcoins, acquiring a secure mailing address, reading up on PGP...<br /><br />This is all well and good, but I finally took the plunge this week and acquired some coin&nbsp; ;) ... which of course, I &#039;cleaned&#039;. This lead to my first purchase just a couple days ago. And now I&#039;m here making my first post on the forum that I&#039;ve acquired so much information from. <br /><br />I suppose I want to say thank you, SR community. :) Thanks for all the information; the well-thought and laid-out sticky posts were absolutely critical to my &quot;success&quot;... Even though this is the first time you&#039;ve heard from me, I feel like I belong here. I plan on sticking around for a while and I hope I can get to know you all better. Take care and keep up the amazing work!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />&quot;Sam&quot;. ;)

				I went a long time without ever posting on the forums.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of drama on here that is unnecesasary in every respect.&nbsp; That being said, respect and consideration (and a little restraint at times) are really all you need to use SR successfully.&nbsp; And some common sense.&nbsp; It&#039;s surprising how many people on here come off as completely uneducated.<br /><br />Glad we have one more solid member in our ranks.

I followed the usual steps in that time -&nbsp; getting a USB drive, making it bootable, encrypting with TrueCrypt (dual layered encryption of course!), getting TOR, reading up on Bitcoins, acquiring a secure mailing address, reading up on PGP...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Tell me with a straight face that all that geeky shit isn&#039;t half the fun :D

				Thanks Sam for adding some dignity to the name noob! I have been lurking, reading and researching a lot too. Some of the posts from noobs&nbsp; make me cringe. (Use the search bar... Take your time to read, it is all there!)<br /><br />I have not purchased yet. And frankly I am a bit concerned with the new flow of people. Vendors are being scammed (why people?! in the end it hurts us all) and require FE for new buyers. Although I do understand, I don&#039;t want to FE. So I am going to keep nosing around. I think I am ready soon though to finally get my hands on some delights. :)<br /><br />Good to know all went well for you and I hope to see a review of the stuff you tried on the forum!

				I&#039;m also a SR n00b who lurked for a couple months and finally took the plunge last week.&nbsp; Received my first order in the mail yesterday.&nbsp; but damn it because of the sudden influx of us noobs I now cannot connect to SR to start thinking about making my second purchase lol.<br />I am sure they will get things ironed out soon enough.&nbsp; But I wanted to sincerely apologize to anyone having connection issues because of new users like us. :)

				Hey Sam! I&#039;m pretty new too and everyone seems amazingly helpful. Like you I lurked on the forums for months, reading everything, before actually joining and taking part in the Road. Thanks so much to the experienced users who post informative content on the forum, it&#039;s super helpful. SR is implicitly based on trust, as either u need to trust the vendor and FE, or they need to trust you and wait for you to finalize. My first few transactions went flawlessly. I second the apology about being new and lagging the hell out of the road, but you know how it is! I support the idea to not allow any new accounts until everything is well sorted out in terms of site accessibility. Maybe we could do the invite idea that I heard a few people mention? Anyway, I&#039;m so excited to be part of this community! Let&#039;s keep it going strong, keep up the professionalism, it&#039;s a great thing we have here.

It has been sai, but I repeat, if only there weren&#039;t more like you, we could even use this as a shining example and<br />have a wading in period; you know register, browse &amp; learn for a minimum time before getting &#039;involved&#039;. <br />&nbsp;I see too many newbies, ordering straight up, then doing something stupid like giving a 1/5 because something fucked up and they didnt <br />speak to the vendor 1st, or they waste valuable space asking questions which have been seen countless times(myself prob. one of &#039;em).<br />Welcome &amp; Long days &amp; pleasant nights on the road, sai.
