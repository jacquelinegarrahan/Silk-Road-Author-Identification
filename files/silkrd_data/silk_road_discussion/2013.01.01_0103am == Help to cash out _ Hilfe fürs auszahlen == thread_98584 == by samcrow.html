				Vendors won&#039;t openly reveal their cashing out methods for obvious reasons. Limetless offers money laundering help for a fee. His review thread is here - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20211.0<br /><br />Goldust

				Hi SamCrow. I understand you are asking about cashing out but there is a German buyer trying to figure out how to buy bitcoin. Not saying you should sell him your coin, but if you know how he can obtain BTC maybe you can help him out:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=99780.0<br /><br />Cheers and good luck with your cash out!<br />

				Cashing out is one thing (and is no big deal) and laundering is another...<br /><br />Keeping it very simple, if you just want to convert BTC to fiat, then just send them to Gox via some wallets that will obscure the trail (Instawallet on Tor, Bitcoinfog, Blockchain wallets and mixer etc etc etc).<br /><br />Now you have cash whose source is obscure, but it is not laundered, and you may be asked to account for it. Laundering is its own separate process that you will need to spend some time on. I have not used Lim&#039;s services so cannot speak for his advice. <br /><br />Many books on the subject as well...<br /><br />BG

				I dunno if this works in Germany, but where I live you can buy re-loadable pre-paid VISA cards from the post office with no idea, which you can then register in a fake name online from an internet cafe. The cards have a balance limit of $1000 at any one time, a withdrawal limit of $500 each day and a monthly limit of $5000 that can be stored on the card. They cost $26.95 to purchase but they come with $20 already loaded onto the card. On the back of the card is a BSB and account number you can use to load the card from a BTC exchange website. The only fee involved is a 9c transaction fee and a $2 fee to use the ATM, apart from the $6.95 cost of the card which is usable for 2 years. There are several types of these cards around, and i&#039;m pretty sure they have them in almost every country. It only costs $4.18 for every $1000 you cash out if you buy the card yourself instead of fucking around with people on here who send them to you and charge like $50 for doing the same thing you can do yourself for next to nothing.<br /><br />I walked around the city going in every post office and brought 20 cards in total, meaning I can now cash out $10K a day from ATMs, or $100K a month in total if I really needed to, which should be plenty for most vendors on here. The best thing about these cards is they aren&#039;t linked to any bank account or my name in any way, and as long as you choose ATMs that aren&#039;t close to camera&#039;s and hold your hand over the internal ATM camera when making your withdrawal you are totally anonymous when cashing out.

				I have completed my cash out guide. Details below. PM me for more info!<br /><br />I. Introduction<br />Many vendors of cashout methods have convinced others and even themselves that this is a complex process which requires wizardry and thousands of dollars in knowledge to achieve. This could not be further from the truth. Others have changed their listings from $10,000 to say $1,000 in weekly maximum withdrawals and don&#039;t even seem to know the security of their own methods or how to launder properly. This simple, cost-effective guide contains all you need to cash out and launder ALL of your SR earnings safely. A backup method for smaller amounts is also disclosed.

Details below. PM me for more info!<br /><br />I. Introduction<br />Many vendors of cashout methods have convinced others and even themselves that this is a complex process which requires wizardry and thousands of dollars in knowledge to achieve. This could not be further from the truth. Others have changed their listings from $10,000 to say $1,000 in weekly maximum withdrawals and don&#039;t even seem to know the security of their own methods or how to launder properly. This simple, cost-effective guide contains all you need to cash out and launder ALL of your SR earnings safely. A backup method for smaller amounts is also disclosed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Based on the stupidity with which you have handled yourself in the many pm&#039;s we have exchanged, I am going to personally advise everyone to steer clear of your supposed knowledge until such time as a reputable vendor has reviewed your document as I have offered to do - even offering to PAY you for the pleasure of helping you to sell it, you moron.<br /><br />Modzi<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Modziw, I am sincerely confused by this message. Many pm&#039;s? You have sent me one message and I replied within 1 day with the exact information you requested. I am not sure where this is coming from, or why you have you responded with so much anger. I posted a product for sale and if you can help me understand why this makes me a moron it would be greatly appreciated. I am sorry you&#039;ve spent money elsewhere and not been satisfied, but if you were to purchase my guide I guarantee you would have 2 legitimate cashout methods.<br />Thanks,<br />NZT<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your calm reply is a good start.<br /><br />I will repeat my offer: Sell me your program at half price now, and I will review it for others and pay you the second half after I have seen that it is worth the coin. Furthermore I will not even require your second &quot;backup&quot; method until I have paid you the second half of your money. I will make my review public and retract any negative postings I have made about you, and will even endorse your product personally if it is usable.<br /><br />Now doesn&#039;t that sound reasonable?<br /><br />Modzi<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Modzi,<br /><br />The only way we have exchanged many pm&#039;s is if you messaged me from a non-vendor account, in which case I would have responded very clearly and truthfully that this guide is not available to non-established vendors at the current time. If that was you earlier, and that&#039;s why you&#039;re upset, I&#039;m apologize - but that policy remains the same, at least for now.<br /><br />Now, either way, you&#039;re obviously an established vendor so I&#039;m fine selling this to you. I just want to be totally transparent on the forums and solve any complaints thoroughly. I&#039;m taking this back to PM&#039;s where it belongs and we can go from there.

				That is a reasoned response, and I don&#039;t think you need more than one test customer to validate your product claims, so how about it? Are you going to open up the curtains and shed a little light on your offering so that you can get the sales you desire? I am not trying to get a sweetheart deal here - I am offering full prce. Half for half and the second half for the second half. Plus a review and even a personal endorsement. <br /><br />[EDIT: GOT PM ON SR &amp; REPLIED]&nbsp; [EDIT#2] Looks like we will make a deal. I am agreeing to his terms so we can see what&#039;s up. I will reply to this thread after I receive the product.<br /><br />Modzi

				Latest PM replied. I will continue to be active via PM at least 1x per day so lets just keep it there until there&#039;s news to report. Forums - we&#039;ll keep you posted when there&#039;s news to share and this service has been confirmed.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />NZT
