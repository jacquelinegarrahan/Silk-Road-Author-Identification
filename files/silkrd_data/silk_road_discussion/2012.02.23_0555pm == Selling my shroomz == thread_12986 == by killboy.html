				So I was wondering...<br />I can get my hands on some golden teachers cubensis.&nbsp; I was thinking of selling them at 100.00 a zip. Thats a great price.&nbsp; I have trouble moving them IRL with my contacts, usually just giving them away as a gift for scoring me dope.<br />&nbsp;I.E. I gave away a eigth because my boy scored me some roxies eventhough I payed a doller a mg.<br /><br />My shrooms are potent, think I would flip them pretty fast at those prices? What amount do I need in my account to start selling?&nbsp; Im afraid nobody will buy from me or give me a chance, so maybe I will offer samples? <br /><br /><br />Also, im clueless on shipping stealth, someone point me in a direction. Thx

				I&#039;ve ate 2 1/8s in the past 6 weeks and they&#039;ve had zero effect on me.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m done buying shrooms but if you think your shits the bomb and they&#039;d get into my head I&#039;d love a sample and if they worked I&#039;d have no problem buying some.&nbsp; (Not just talking shit, I&#039;ve talked about my shroom thing on a couple of different posts in the forums).&nbsp; I had an amazing time on shrooms the first time I did them about 4 or 5 years ago but that&#039;s the only time they&#039;ve worked for me.&nbsp; Send me a PM and we can talk.&nbsp;

				At a hundred an O I&#039;d definitely be interested. I&#039;d love a sample (willing to pay) to determine just how potent yours are relative to others shrooms I&#039;ve had before.

				Golden teachers is a legit strain...was the first one I ever grew I think.&nbsp; Most cubensis are along the same lines as far as potency goes (IMO) but the way they&#039;re grown, packaged and stored plays a huge part.&nbsp; There is of course the random strains that someone has isolated that is out of this world potent...a la PE/Albinos.<br /><br />It&#039;s less than a couple hundred bucks to open a seller account and samples is definitely the quickest way to get some feedback going.&nbsp; I did a few custom listings for a coin and people got ~4 grams to play with for that and it seemed to go over pretty well.

				At 100 an O I guarantee people would buy. It cost around ~$180 worth of BTC to become a vendor, plus you will need to get a vac seal, and some colored tissue paper(the kind they put in gift bags).&nbsp; Put the shrooms in a ziplock with a small air bubble (so they don&#039;t get crushed when you vac seal), vacseal, wrap in a layer or two of tissue (in case the package gets accidentally knocked open when traveling in the mail), and ALWAYS print the labels (you can get vac seal, and printer shipping labels at major department store). Once you have your account, find the smallest dose that will make a slightly heavy / large person trip decently. Make this your sample amount, and charge a small amount; sell 10 -20 samples. Then start listing ounces. <br />Good luck, and other than that just treat your customers great and you will go really well.<br /><br />~DigitalAlch
