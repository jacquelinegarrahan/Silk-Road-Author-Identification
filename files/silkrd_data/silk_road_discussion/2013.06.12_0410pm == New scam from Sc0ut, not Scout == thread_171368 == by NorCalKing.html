				Sc0ut &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear SR Buyers and Vendors,<br /><br />Its Scout here. SR admin and also forum moderator.<br /><br />I have had some personal problems in my life and my financial situation has hit all-time low. As a consequence, I am sorrowfully writing this plea message in the hope that some of you that I have helped over the years might consider returning the favor. I am trying to raise $10,000 to pay off some urgent debts which must be settled or sadly my life will be in danger. All loans payed to me will be paid as soon as I am in a financial position to do so. I foresee this as being no longer than 3-6 months but currently can place no firm guarantee on any time-frame.<br /><br />You may send any loans to my SR username via the main SR site. This way I can associate a username with the amount that was loaned and will help to keep a record.<br /><br /><br />Best Wishes,<br />Scout<br /><br /><br />P.S. Special thank you to DPR for giving me the go-ahead and allowing me to make this request. Where would I be without you? :)

				Haha, stupid. First of all, Scout is Scout. Not Sc0ut. <br /><br />Secondly, this is by the far the dumbest scam yet, because asking money to be sent to Sc0ut&#039;s &quot;username on the main site&quot; will inevitably get money sent to either<br />Scout (the real account) or if someone&#039;s stupid enough Sc0ut (the fake account and since it will be in SR&#039;s system.. the scammer would last 2 minutes before SR shut it all down and froze any funds).<br /><br />Thirdly, and most importantly, we all know Scout. We all know that he&#039;s racked up more then $10,000 in debt to the mafia and the triads, not to mention his gambling addiction and penchant for prostitutes and blow. Last I heard Scout was actually closer to $60k in the red. So this imposter Sc0ut couldn&#039;t even get that right&nbsp; :P

				Rule of thumb for SR, if someone asks you for money, don&#039;t send them any!<br /><br />This goes for you PIN and *Any* other info as well. <br />I cant believe this needs to be said but please don&#039;t help the scammers!<br /><br />And take to the almighty forums to warn your fellow community members.

				I agree. Ive yet to feel sympathy for many of the people who get scammed in these scams.

				G,day SSBD....Are you serious, people are falling for this? Maybe they are naive&nbsp; to say the least, but you wonder how these people are scoring, without getting arrested. And certainly it takes a little intelligence to stay a step ahead of L/E and the Postal services, but if you can use PGP then you&#039;re certainly clever enough to know a scam when you see one, do you think? These noobs should realize for a start, nobody from SR, staff would name themselves fake or not, there&#039;s your first alarm bell. Then don&#039;t go on forum, number 2, <br />I&#039;m incredulous, could you give me a ball park idea how many people got hit?<br /><br />I hoestly think you should ask DPR could we all donate a little BTC thousands of us, we could make you Mods, rich over night, and show are appreciation for the stirling work done by yourselves.<br />

The only URL you should ever be using is silkroadvb5piz3r.onion; any other URLs you receive in messages etc. are phishing sites that will lead to your account being compromised and your funds withdrawn.<br /><br /><br /><br />Libertas

				I think if you change it in your settings so it doesn&#039;t show when you are online or not, you won&#039;t get these PMs.&nbsp; I do this and have never once gotten one of these scam PMs and have been around to see at least 10 of them circulate.&nbsp; I actually feel a little left out of the action, maybe I need to change my settings and join the fun.
