				I was wondering if anyone knew a pretty legit/safe way to get a personal amount of MDMA across the Canada border coming from the USA? I will be celebrating New Years in Canada and I want to take enough MDMA for me and a few friends but I have no idea how tough customs are to get through. Does anyone have any ideas or thoughts that could help me!? I would greatly appreciate it!

				i&#039;ve driven to canada a whole bunch of times.&nbsp; usually i didn&#039;t smuggle anything but one time my wife and i brought weed, ecstasy, and psilocybin capsules into canada once.&nbsp; we vacuum sealed it in a long narrow bag and bought a bottle of really smelly shampoo with a tiny opening...we could just barely wedge the package in there.<br />sure enough, we got stopped for a couple hours at the border.&nbsp; they didn&#039;t bring out dogs, but they went through ALL our shit.&nbsp; i&#039;ve heard they sometimes do empty shampoo bottles, so i guess we got lucky.<br /><br />one time when i was younger than that, college aged, my friend and i went to a 3 day rave and i brought a 10-strip of acid.&nbsp; i just put the acid in my underwear (you boxer-brief wearers know about the little pocked in the bottom front between the two layers of fabric that form the pee-hole).&nbsp; it was fine though, they didn&#039;t stop us.&nbsp; probably just thought we were two under 21&#039;s going to get shitfaced in montreal (is very common practice amongst college students in the northeast usa).<br /><br />with just powdered mdma you&#039;ve got a lot of options.&nbsp; the time with the wife, they patted me down and looked through my wallet but didn&#039;t grab my junk or make me remove any clothes, so there&#039;s a few options there if you get creative.&nbsp; or you could slip it into a maxi pad...they usually won&#039;t go through feminine products.&nbsp; if you could open up a tampon and put the dope in there and seal it back up, then put it in a box of other tampons that could work.&nbsp; and on this train of thought, the vagina itself is hands-down the most secure place to transport drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;maybe if you know about cars there&#039;s some super stealthy spot you can tape the bag to<br /><br />there&#039;s a good chance they&#039;ll just ask you a couple questions (where you going, what are you doing, do you have any alcohol, tobacco, or firearms) and then wave you on through (especially if no one with you has ever been &quot;in front of a judge&quot;), but i&#039;ve been stopped more than once.&nbsp; sometimes they just hold you up to run some background checks, but if you seem suspicious, they&#039;ll go all out with the dogs and everything.&nbsp; thank god i didn&#039;t have anything with me the time they brought out dogs.&nbsp; it was me, a young hippy, and a scruffy looking biker gay dude in his 40&#039;s who both answered &quot;yes&quot; to their infamous question, &quot;have you ever been in front of a judge.&quot;<br /><br />prepare for the worst, but hope for the best.&nbsp; be relaxed, honest, respectful, have a real good hiding spot, and you&#039;ll probably be fine.
