Kurt, in future do yourself a favor and never Finalize Early for any vendor cause now you have no recourse other than changing a feedback comment that won&#039;t be seen. There are loads of excellent vendors who want you to stay in Escrow and not F.E. :)

				Yeah, stay in escrow or one day you&#039;ll feel so stupid after being scammed (it&#039;s happened to me) and there&#039;s absolutely nothing nobody can do to help you.
