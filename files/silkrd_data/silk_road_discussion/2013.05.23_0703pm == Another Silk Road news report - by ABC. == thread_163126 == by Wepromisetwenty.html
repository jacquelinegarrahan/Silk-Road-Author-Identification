				People are always going to blame someone or something else for the what happens, never themselves or who they think they love (they think, because removing responsibility from another is not what love is).<br /><br />It&#039;s also fun to see how the mother insisted she wanted the good of her son when she turned him to the police for drugs, hence ruining his life forever. To save his life? What life? The child will not probably have a life anymore just because you have destroyed it. You have turned your back into your son, you showed him that betraying an other human being is an acceptable thing, you have removed his trust from yourself and you have ruined his future. Good job. If you wanted to REALLY help him this was the worst thing you could do.<br /><br />As for the other mother with the child that became insane, I would like to know the real story because something is amiss there. Much probably the little caring mother didn&#039;t tell the abuse she has given to her son, to the point of making him (some kind of drugs could naturally speed the process) going insane. There are so many mothers doing psychological abuse to their sons while thinking they do it &quot;for their own good&quot; (we have an example just above). When tragedies happens (as the boy turning into serial killer or insane) there&#039;s always something else to blame for it, as the drugs or the devil.

Before Silk Road was even a twinkle in DPR&#039;s eye. <br /><br />Blaming SR for these peoples troubles is just ridiculous.

And also, that he received... exactly what he wanted, pure as pure can be.<br /><br />If anything, it makes his decision to go out this way even more his own doing than it would be were it not SR related. Lets face it, you have to be pretty committed to get your shit here - its not spur of the moment. Its planned. You know what you&#039;re doing - and you even have time to reflect on it while your mailman gets his shit together.

				Obviously its SR&#039;s fault! <br /><br />Its not like this kid, found out how to buy drugs online, made an account on a site that lets you do that, got the drugs shipped to him and consumed them himself. <br /><br />I didnt read article or watch video but this probably happens more often and isn&#039;t reported, better them than me. <br /><br />RIP

RC&#039;s have a real stigma attached to them, for the sheer fact there are so many &#039;unknowns&#039; about them. I mean, what consitutes an &#039;RC&#039;? Is it not just any man made, mind altering substance being sold for human consumption that hasn&#039;t yet been categorized by the law? Stands to reason that there&#039;d be some fucking grim substances out there, but I think there are a few that are pretty decent. Seems like all the good ones get made illegal though&nbsp; ::)
