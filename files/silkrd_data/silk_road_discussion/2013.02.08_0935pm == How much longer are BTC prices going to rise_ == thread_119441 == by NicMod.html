				BTC nightmare!<br /><br />When I first started they were at 6 Euro. Didn&#039;t really know they&#039;d rise and fall so much to be honest.<br /><br />The crowd I use to buy them are also terrible. I wanted to buy yayo this week and sent close to just enough for the order to the account to buy bitcoins and with no sign of the money after a few days I messaged them to see where the money was and all of a sudden it appears in my account but the price for bitcoins had risen by about $2 in the meantime so I don&#039;t have enough now for what I wanted to buy at the start of the week.<br /><br />They&#039;ll defo drop drastically again with news and scares and I&#039;d say the more bitcoins are used and become more popular as a form of trade, the future is more or less rising. Surely if they become too high in price they become not worth using for most folk or am I being ignorant on the matter? <br /><br />Would be nice to be loaded to invest in large amounts as an investment but I&#039;d only use them for drugs on here all the time so I might be best not getting into it!!!&nbsp; :)

				This topic has been somewhat covered in &#039;Philosophy, Economics and Law&#039;. Id say Bitcoin echange rates come under the &#039;Economics&#039; part of that title.&nbsp; No one seems to know why the rise but probably a supply and demand with supply constrained by slowing release of coin and demand increased by mining, hoarding and perhaps even wider use as more outlet begin to take bitcoin.&nbsp; Its all a bit &#039;Tulipmania&quot;. It really doesnt help the Road with this kind of appreciation in price. Currency wont work properly if its an instrument of speculation in itself. The price was around 13USD end of Dec and now at ~22USD. No sign of slowing.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I am fairly certain that in the short-medium term (2 months) or so, bitcoin will be steady at $30-33 ea. What I&#039;m not certain of, is how the price per bitcoin will get there. I believe that there may be a crash/bubble-pop before then, but not a catastrophic one, maybe $5-8 per bitcoin after which the price will rise to the aforementioned low thirties. Since I&#039;m not certain about the crash I&#039;m investing a few grand into bitcoin now (in case there is no crash) and a few more grand if my prediction does come true.

				To be honest, I hope that the exchange rate will crash, in this case I could buy a fuckload of Bitcoin.<br />Even if the rate would crash, I don&#039;t see this a problem, because supply &amp; demand would automatically help to raise it again.

				You should ask the vendor to put up his prices in Dollars , rather than bitcoins. Its unfair to the buyer. I am also a vendor here and I put my prices in dollars. Infact if I were you I would not deal with such a vendor because there is an option here to put up the prices in dollars and if the rate rises, the bitcoins drop making it worth the same amount. If us vendors don&#039;t want to play on the bitcoin rate, we can hedge escrow. So you should definitely ask your vendor to give you a fixed rate.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119441.msg820351#msg820351">Quote from: sleepyeyes2k2 on February 13, 2013, 06:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m in the exact opposite boat.&nbsp; I&#039;m going, &quot;Damn, if I&#039;d ordered those pills yesterday, they&#039;d have been $64, now I still want the same damn pills, nothing about them has changed, and they&#039;re $72, and the shipping, which is supposed to be a flat $6, is now sitting at $12.50!&nbsp; Jesus, if I wait until tomorrow, I might as well buy twice the number!<br /><br />So, I go to put the money in today, and bitinstant is down.&nbsp; Son of a whore!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				More and more people are accepting BTC.&nbsp; Heck even Reddit just started accepting it for buying &quot;Reddit Gold&quot; on their site.<br /><br />You guys should subscribe to (clearnet) http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin sometime.&nbsp; Lots of interesting stories every day, and most of them announcing more and more people / organizations that are accepting BTC.&nbsp; As BTC becomes more pervasive the price will keep going up.<br /><br />When you consider that you don&#039;t really have to declare BTC transaction to the IRS they become way more attractive.&nbsp; People are slowly starting to realize this and I&#039;m pretty sure the government is going to start freaking out pretty hardcore within the next few years.&nbsp; The idea of cutting off the bloodline of the coercive state creates an existential crisis for the government.
