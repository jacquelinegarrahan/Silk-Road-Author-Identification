				SunWu,<br /><br />As one of your most loyal and repeat customers, I am overwhelmed to see you back up in business.&nbsp; I was terrifically concerned when I hadn&#039;t heard from you or your whereabouts for quite sometime...&nbsp; This is extremely good news indeed.&nbsp; Over the last couple of weeks I have made many acquaintances whom are fentanyl connoisseurs as am I.&nbsp; Our like-minded interests have placed us in a unique situation of being starved for your product or a product like yours.&nbsp; The market has been very bare over the last couple of weeks and from what I&#039;ve seen and personally purchased, the quality is subpar.&nbsp; You never lowered the bar on your end when it came to quality, purity and potency...&nbsp; <br /><br />Please do PM me or email me about our previous transaction that was never fulfilled due to SR being shutdown.&nbsp; I speak for everyone when I say welcome back.&nbsp; That is a huge burden off many shoulder&#039;s and a relief like no other for people like myself.&nbsp; You not only served a purpose that nobody else could provide, you did it with class, professionalism, decency, trust, honor, politeness, and most of all respect.&nbsp; You respected your customers and treated them as you yourself wished to be treated, and for that you need to be commended; especially in a community such as this...&nbsp; I have been around a long time and it is always rare indeed to find someone with such professionalism to get the job done correctly, promptly and safely.&nbsp; Without you I know that I would be lost, as would many on here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s to many more successful transactions on the gram scale!&nbsp; <br /><br />Your friend always,<br /><br />-Trocar<br />trocar@safe-mail.net
