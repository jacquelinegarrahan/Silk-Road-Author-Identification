				I have been away for a little month break and I came back a couple days ago but it seems like all hell has broke loose here at our meeting place, we worry, we wonder, we think we should jump ship and that its all over but no no no we must stand fast and stay strong, we can not turn our backs on Silk Road.<br /><br />I can just sense in some of the posts Ive been reading people are on the fence about leaving SR, inc vendors, this is only human nature of course your going to feel this way, however, we must unite at this difficult time and ride out this cyber shake, if we leave now then when will it end?&nbsp; <br /><br />We move on, the next market place comes under attack so we move on again, the next market place comes under attack and so we move on again until there is no stability left and all that is left is buyers spread out over tens of different sites all with no real loyalty or consistency, no one trusting anyone and people scamming every where until the concept crash&#039;s and people just stop buying and selling online.<br /><br />It is now up to us the Silk Road community to set examples as to how we stand our ground when the shit hits the fan remember this is all new so we remain calm and we keep our faith because if we loose faith there&#039;s a good chance Silk Road will loose its faith too, we can not let that happen, we have worked to hard to let this all go now.<br /><br />Me I know what I&#039;m going to do, I ration my stash, I have my btc ready on standby in a separate wallet this way theres no last minute rushing, I wait, I wait, I wait and then I will see Silk Road alive and kicking again and I resume my normal routines. Do not jump ship people, now is the time to stand fast and stay strong, we are here to stay.<br /><br />I&#039;m Proud to be here,&nbsp; I&#039;m proud to be Silk Road forever!<br /><br />Silk Road till I ...<br />

				Couldnt agree more my fellow traveler of the Road. This community represents a new paradigm shift in the global consciousness and we are literally setting trends and contributing in some small way to history. If i could I&#039;d +1 as well. Much love man.

				I think this is Overthinking The Section a bit. You needn&#039;t worry. It has given us something to talk about but no one&#039;s jumping yet.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
