				The lure of money has got me coming back to this site. I have some items that arent worth anything in my area but seem to be pretty valuable on sr. I have a friend who has bought, not sold, items on sr and he has been bugging me to get on here. Buying items is one thing, but what about selling. What is and how do I use the pgp block? What about payment and bitcoins. I do not have use for bitcoins. I kind of understand how they work but I do not plan on buying anything from sr. What are the other payment potions that are safe. Cash is ideal for me. Are green dot money packs safe? Do I need to buy some bitcoins to set up a sellers account? I am stateside, what about shipping. Who do i use for shipping besides usps, ups, fed ex? How secure is it to use these carriers?<br />I assume I could keep reading through all the post and I will but I wanted to ask a few questions directly. <br />I will probably start by offering some low priced items like mushroom cultures and once I get some trustworthy feedback I will put some opana up. I might have to come up with&nbsp; new nickname since rusty trombone isnt really a sellers name. I dont know.<br /><br />Thanks

				All of the information that you asked is in the forums. I can&#039;t speak for all vendors, but I know that I have read the forums for many hours before I even felt comfortable becoming a vendor. Just read through them, but use your head &amp; try to find the ones that are serious.

				You have a &quot;Long Road&quot; ahead of you. You are severely misinformed at best on most of the things that you mentioned. I hope (for your sake) that you do a LOT of homework before you even think about vending anything.<br /><br />

				no information is the wrong information = misinformation.<br /><br />Even thinking about any other currency = terrible misinformation<br /><br />not even beginning to know what PGP is or &quot;pgp block&quot; as you call it = misinformation<br /><br />&quot;what other payments options are safe?&quot; ..... NONE.<br /><br />like I said you have a lot to learn. I wish you the best, but as I said...its a long road ahead (pun intended)<br /><br />Start with the SR wiki. Then move to the forums search feature.<br />

				as Tryptonite&nbsp; said 95% of all your answers are on the forums, and then some....I did a lot of reading, i mean a lot before i started buying on the road, and i still do research before ordering a new product or ordering from a new vendor<br /><br />Couple basic pointers<br /><br />Use PGP for sensitive correspondence <br /><br />Never FE<br /><br />Only use BC on the road, never do a side deal with alternate currency <br /><br />Research every buyer before making purchases, check the vendors page, and the vendors forum thread<br /><br />If you feel somethings wrong don&#039;t take the chance!!

				What about me? I could care less about your $10 spores, but Shroomeister is completely right about all that he said! Vendors that aren&#039;t prepared never last. Good luck to you.

				Most of information is pretty easy to learn like using bitcoins and PGP encryption.<br /><br />As a vendor, the hard part would be learning about discrete shipping techniques and converting bitcoins back into cash without trace.

The reason they dont bother me is that anyone can make a print, however making a clean print, syringe or culture takes time and talent, mess one batch up and you loose your cred on SR. Remember, everyone who buys from you can rate you for service and if a spore syringe is contaminated they will make sure to let everyone know!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Prepared for what? How long do I need to last. I just want to get rid of a couple hundred op and move on.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not sure what op is but if you are referring to a couple of hundred prints or syringes, then you are in for a surprise. It should not take more than 4 or 5 years to move a couple of hundred prints. <br /><br />All in all what you sell is irrelevant, sell used condoms for all I care. You are starting and running a business. Building a business takes time, effort, and an eye to the needs of your customers. I have said it before and will say it again, SR is not a GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. Dont expect to hop on and dump a bunch of stuff cheep then disappear. The customers of SR want quality and to be comfortable that the vendor knows what he is doing and will not get them busted.<br />
