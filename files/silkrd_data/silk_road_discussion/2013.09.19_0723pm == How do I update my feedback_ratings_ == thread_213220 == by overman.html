				I FE&#039;d for a vendor (please don&#039;t tell me &quot;just don&#039;t FE&quot; as an answer) and I was prompted to leave a rating and feedback as usual... however this is my first order since the feedback system change. The page I saw was similar to the one on the sr wiki, where it says <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You also have a sixth option of leaving no rating at all. Once you leave a rating, you will not be able to change it except to remove it entirely! This means you should not leave a rating unless you have received your order, are fully satisfied with it, and have made every attempt to solve any problems with the vendor. There is nothing wrong with waiting to rate your vendor.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, I decided to leave it unrated until my package arrived. However, I left a review after I finalized (was that my mistake?) <br /><br />Now my package arrived and the seller deserves a 5/5- however, the option that used to be under &quot;account settings&quot; called &quot;view&gt; update feedback&quot; is gone. I can view my feedback under &quot;recent orders,&quot; but there is nowhere to update the rating. <br /><br />Advice is needed...

				There is no way to edit your rankings/reviews. If you elected to leave no rating, then you have permanently left no rating. In the future, after finalizing, don&#039;t leave a rating or review until you are confident what that rating/review should be.

				A vendor who encourages ratings and feedback from new customers before you receive the product would make me nervous.<br /><br />If you click to accept the default choice of &#039;no rating&#039;, you just rated them a no rating and cant change that. If you don&#039;t click on it, you can choose a rating later. I&#039;m not sure if you can do feedback and then a rating later or a rating and do feedback later. I think you can. But, if you click to choose the 6th rating choice, you just rated them permanently. SR ought to make this much easier to understand. Maybe add the word &quot;permanently&quot; to the no-rating choice and the accept-rating button.

				Just allow buyer to edit recent rating . Simple....<br /><br />And we are almost back to the old system :)<br /><br />Many of my clients are confused. Leaving ratings that dont want leave and many dont even bother to comprehend the whole feedback thing and I am left with no feedback at all. <br /><br />unrated &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no review<br /><br />Looks familiar ? :)<br /><br />But I am starting to get used to it.....

				Thanks to both of you. Nugz- I actually wasn&#039;t encouraged by the vendor at all, I&#039;ve just always left 5/5 in the past after I FE. This time though, the page said according to the new feedback system I should not leave a rating, and I wanted to stay within the guidelines. Thanks for the info though, I&#039;ll just leave 5/5 from now on when I finalize. Or I&#039;ll wait completely.

				You don&#039;t have to leave feedback immediately. Any time after you&#039;ve completed your transaction but haven&#039;t left a review/feedback yet, visit that vendor&#039;s page, right under his/her name there will be 4 options instead of 3 options written in green. You&#039;ll see the normal &quot;message&quot;, &quot;discuss&quot;, and &quot;report&quot; buttons but until you&#039;ve left your written review there will also be a fourth button written in green that says, you guessed it, &quot;review&quot;. And it can never be changed. This has been the rule for about a month now.
