				Silk Road wiki is good too&quot;<br /><br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki<br /><br />As for good shroom vendors, it depends on where you are. Rocker and StarService are good for USA based customers.

				Fucking love that podcast.&nbsp; For that reason alone I feel inclined to help you.<br /><br />You will probably want to go to the grocery store and buy a moneypak.&nbsp; Then you will want to find a vendor that will exchange your moneypak for bitcoins.&nbsp; You should locate a vendor off of silkroad, more on a bitcoin vendor that does not associate with silkroad at all.&nbsp; Or you can use a SR vendor, but I like to keep that part separate.&nbsp; <br /><br />When they send you bitcoins I would use a temporary wallet, no need to download bitcoin client on your computer at all.&nbsp; I use instawallet.org.&nbsp; Go to the site and bookmark the URL you are given, it is unique.&nbsp; You are also provided an address to send your coins to.&nbsp; Have your moneypak &gt; bitcoin vendor send your bitcoins to this address.<br /><br />Create an account on Silkroad.&nbsp; Go to the account options and it will tell you the address to send your bitcoins to.&nbsp; Go to instawallet and send them to this address on bitcoin.&nbsp; It will fund your account and only now are you ready to buy.<br /><br />Go on these forums and read up on vendors.&nbsp; If you are looking for cannabis there is a sticky thread in the rumor mill section for cannabis.&nbsp; Read post #1 and read all the recent posts.&nbsp; Use the reputable vendors.&nbsp; Same goes for the shrooms, although there will be less info.<br /><br />You can obtain bitcoins in other ways than moneypak but that seems like the most anonymous and feasible for most people.&nbsp; You can use other routes though.<br /><br />Stay safe.

				I&#039;ve never used Bitinstant, but if you do use the MoneyPak route use SugarMama.&nbsp; She&#039;s safe and never scams.&nbsp; Read her review thread.&nbsp; You money is safe with her!

If you were to tell your bank that the transaction was unauthorised they would refund the money to your account and the Bitcoin seller would be left with no money and no Bitcoin.
