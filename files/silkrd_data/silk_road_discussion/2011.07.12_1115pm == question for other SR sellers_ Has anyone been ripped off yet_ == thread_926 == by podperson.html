				I&#039;m curious to know if any sellers have had a buyer claim they never got the package yet?<br /><br />I also wondered if there should be a place to post these issues and name the buyers in question

				This topic was discussed in a thread. Some suggested to have buyer review (number of successful transactions).<br />But how will you know the package arrived and the buyer is scamming or was confiscated (especially a concern in intl&#039; trading)? Maybe tracking can indicate that... maybe one method would be to keep in the server the zip code hash....

				well, I guess I was thinking it might be a good idea to keep track of anyone who says they did not get a package. I mean if that same person keeps not getting their package then it might be a good idea for sellers to avoid that buyer and cancel their orders... although i guess they could just make a new profile... hmmmm<br /><br />I use delivery confirmation on most of my orders and it realy is the only way to be sure.

				I think&nbsp; that vendors would keep track of the zipcode of a buyer they suspect of cheating them. Yes, they could just make a new profile, but then their zipcode would be useless and it would be more difficult to have a package sent to a new one. This is just a theory of what I&#039;ve read on the forums, don&#039;t know if any sellers have actually done this..
