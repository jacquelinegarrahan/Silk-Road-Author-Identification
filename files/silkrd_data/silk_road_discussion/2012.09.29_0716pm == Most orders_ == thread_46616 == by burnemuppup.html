You posed this question on September 29th, and today is October 2nd, you haven&#039;t expanded as to why you want this information. <br /><br />To answer your question, in case you didn&#039;t realise, we&#039;re on an antonymous marketplace on the &#039;dark web&#039; with our IPs concealed for anonymous browsing, purchasing from an annoymous marketplace, we&#039;re on here because we want information regarding our purchase history to stay ANNONYMOUS, because in 99% of instances here we&#039;re purchasing contraband - This is not bloody Ebay, we&#039;re dealing with serious stuff here, not to be taken lightly. You obviously do not care for personal security, or anonymity by asking this stupid question, if you don&#039;t care about these things you shouldn&#039;t be on here. Please go and fish elsewhere, your market research skills are poor Mr. Reporter/Coppa/Whoever you are.

SilkRoad gives us a sanctuary of freedom, security, safety, and a forum, where we can review other vendors, and share opinions, benefits that IRL world could never provide. The police wasting their time in this manner, is a waste of tax payers money, shame on them, shame on them all. In the name of our annonymous freedom, I say you suck OP. Acrimonious I know, but I feel stongly against anybody threatening my annonymous freedom and others. Feel free to red card me if I&#039;m wrong StExo. I love the way things are at the moment, and I never want it to end.&nbsp; :)
