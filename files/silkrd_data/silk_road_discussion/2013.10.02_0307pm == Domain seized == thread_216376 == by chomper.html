				That is what I&#039;m seeing, I&#039;m not sure that it is genuine though, it looks very sketchy so I suspect that it is not a IRS/ICE/DEA joint op and is more likely something more innocuous.

				Ok, i&#039;m convinced its a hustle.<br /><br />Look at the image and you have a giant silkroad camel watermarked in it.&nbsp; Plus the whole notice looks kinda off.<br /><br />Compare it to the megaupload.com seize message *clearnet* http://torrentfreak.com/images/siteseized.jpg<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure the US government isn&#039;t in the business of using site logos, and arn&#039;t they all ment to be laid off anyway?<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking either funny joke, or hack

				1.) It COULD be that, because they are the money-givers for developing the TOR software they had a backdoor everyone was sure its not in (think of prism and what the nsa did...) OR<br />2.)

				If SR has been taken down, <br />my guess is that this forum will be the next step (to avoid us to reorganise). <br /><br />I hope I&#039;m wrong and that SR will be back up soon, <br />but keeping in mind what has happened to the site (and the Tor network) during the last months, <br />I&#039;m not sure our beloved market will be back online...<br />but, without any doubt, as a phoenix something new (and better?) will rise from it&#039;s ashes! <br /><br />Best to all of you, <br />and I hope time will tell me wrong. <br /><br />DPR - prove me I&#039;m wrong!!!

Enough to pay for my kids education is sitting in my account that the feds could have control of now. BUT I doubt it. The feds would be ALL over the news with this, and if SR pulled a runner I doubt they would let us all think the DEA seized the site as we would obviously eventually find out it is a lie.

				18 U.S.C. 983(j) though is Restraining orders. But DPR Arrested....fukk<br /><br />(j) Restraining Orders; Protective Orders.—<br />(1) Upon application of the United States, the court may enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, create receiverships, appoint conservators, custodians, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to seize, secure, maintain, or preserve the availability of property subject to civil forfeiture—<br />(A) upon the filing of a civil forfeiture complaint alleging that the property with respect to which the order is sought is subject to civil forfeiture; or<br />(B) prior to the filing of such a complaint, if, after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that—<br />(i) there is a substantial probability that the United States will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and<br />(ii) the need to preserve the availability of the property through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered.<br />(2) An order entered pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be effective for not more than 90 days, unless extended by the court for good cause shown, or unless a complaint described in paragraph (1)(A) has been filed.<br />(3) A temporary restraining order under this subsection may be entered upon application of the United States without notice or opportunity for a hearing when a complaint has not yet been filed with respect to the property, if the United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought is subject to civil forfeiture and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture. Such a temporary order shall expire not more than 14 days after the date on which it is entered, unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period. A hearing requested concerning an order entered under this paragraph shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.<br />(4) The court may receive and consider, at a hearing held pursuant to this subsection, evidence and information that would be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.<br /><br />&nbsp;

I also don&#039;t see how this could of happened, how could they seize bitcoins? Surely that would of been encrypted?

				Interesting comment on the Guardian about the closure<br /><br />The FBI are involved in more crime than silkroad ever would be. So where&#039;s the justice? As it looks, that seizure image isn&#039;t typical of the usual kind, that the FBI put onto servers they&#039;ve ilegally hacked into. Notice the watermark of the SR logo in the background, and &quot;this hidden site has been seized&quot;.<br />I would guess the image was created by SR staff to be used in a dead man&#039;s switch. DPR probably slipped up somewhere, aware that the FBI were onto him, sends a command to the server that SR runs on, and &#039;boom&#039; all data is wiped, placing that image as a warning to it&#039;s users.<br />If they get to him, they get to the servers physical location. Would seem like a highly logical failsafe.<br /><br /><br />The site most likely hasn&#039;t been seized by the FBI, just shutdown and made inaccessible by SR admins, because of DPR being found out.

				This makes absolutely no sense at all.. Did anyone read the &#039;criminal complaint&#039;? Apparently DPR was blackmailed by some character named &quot;friendlychemist&quot; who owned 500k to his &quot;narcotics suppliers&quot; and by demonstrating a few addresses and proof to having a login to some &quot;vendors account&quot;, DPR bought that he was a problem.. Mind you this is all happening in unencrypted messaging over the web server, considering it was taken from the &quot;silk road web server&quot;.. No instead of paying the ransom, he tells friendlychemist to have his supplier, &#039;redandwhite&#039; (really putting some salt on the wound there&quot;), to contact him on SR.. which they apparently have never used before considering they weren&#039;t selling on there. At that point, DPR asks redandwhite hold much it would cost to put a hit on friendlychemist. Now.. apparently redandwhite have no idea who friendlychemist is, yet somehow he owes them 500k, and someone DPR gives them his information.. They allegedly murder this people who had &quot;a wife and three kids&quot; and provide a picture evidence with some random numbers in the picture. In the end tho, there was never a report of this ever happening.. So fine, BS on the that.. It gets even worse considering DPR contacts redandwhite to make him fake ids with his picture and shipping address!! These fake ids just &quot;happened to be routinely stopped&quot; considering they were coming from fucking Canada.. Now why the fuck would he order fake ids from canada when there are plenty in the states, and use the DPR username.. Pshh, that&#039;s just the tip of the iceberg. This makes no fucking sense.

				So many questions. This logo looks like some shitty MS paint crap. WHY IS THE SR LOGO THERE!? LE doesn&#039;t give a shit about graphic design and style, it would have to be a stock image.<br />Also, do the feds have the physical server? I&#039;m guessing yes since DPR had to of had the servers in his house. To get the graphic on the front page though...LE would have to have control over the server....but that shit has to be mega encrypted so the only way in would be if DPR granted them access. DPR knows his shit though, why didn&#039;t he plead the 5th and lawyer up?<br /><br />The hitman and friendlychemist stuff is bullshit, has to be. All the deepweb hitman services are BS you guys fucking know that. How would some guy have identities to thousands of users anyway? Even if it was true there&#039;s no way this guy knew DPR&#039;s identity, so why would he care?. Also of course, there&#039;s no record of this shit anyway.<br /><br />So fucking glad I spent the last of my coin just recently

				The murder for hire aspect does seem suspicious, there was no body. It may have simply been intimidation but the whole thing sounds like it was drawn up by a PSYOPS team like the part with the numerical code photo. That part seems like a macabre joke on behalf of the scriptwriter.<br /><br />Maybe they had enough of our activity and have used this as the only thing to truly vilify him.

				I read something in an article quoting an &quot;unnamed&quot; FBI spokesperson who basically made it sound like the Forbes interview was the straw that broke the Camel&#039;s back(pun intended). <br /><br />&quot;He said he&#039;d never be arrested just 3 months ago...&quot;&nbsp; &quot;...you don&#039;t taunt the FBI, we WILL find you.&quot; something along those lines.&nbsp; We all told him that was arrogant, and unwise... but he&#039;s the fucking Dread Pirate Knowitall.
