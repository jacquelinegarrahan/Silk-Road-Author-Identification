				Looked at this forum plenty of times &amp; have found the info very useful. Been a member of SR for quite some time now &amp; well what can I say, I love SR&nbsp; :)<br />This is my 1st post so 1st of all i&#039;d just like to say hello to you guys.<br /><br />I have a question mainly targeted to sellers from the UK. I&#039;ve noticed over the past months there appears to be a bit of a clamp down on being able to purchase Bitcoins in the UK, but hey we all find an alternative dont we :). Do you think the authorities have asked the UK banks to watch out for or report any payments made from Bitcoin exchange services to a UK bank account, as I say there appears to be a bit of a clamp down.<br /><br />The reason I ask is because i&#039;m thinking about becoming a seller on SR myself and am just worried about whether the authorities would look into why I have payments going into my bank account &amp; if it did get flagged up then how would I explain where I got the Bitcoins from? am I just being paranoid?<br /><br />Or can any other sellers or UK sellers tell me how they exchange there bitcoins for GBP without leaving a trail to their bank account?<br /><br />Any replies would be much appreciated. <br /><br />Cheers guys

				So what company was it you work for again, News Of The World, The Mail On Sunday or MI-5?<br /><br />I just wasn&#039;t sure and needed to clarify before we can begin an interview.

				Buying bitcoin is not against the law.<br /><br />The banks don&#039;t like competition.

				Thanks for the reply gazwel. It&#039;s not the fact of buying Bitcoins, the reason I&#039;m asking is because if I become a seller &amp; have withdrawals from an exchange service to my bank account will it flag anything up if it it did how would I explain where I got the bitcoins from?<br /><br />Thanks

Main problem is that you will have to be really, but really close to that person as fiends turn into fucked up skunks. At the same time you need to find a secure way of conducting conducting this business. You will have to figure that out.<br /><br />Your fiend will not have any problems with selling the BTC as he is not doing anything illegal. The guy I&#039;m meeting at the moment for btc told me that he&#039;s just helping out a fiend. So i figured he&#039;s helping a vendor on SR, might be just my bad logic but it&#039;s worth a try.<br /><br />Of course there are some risks involved you are a drug dealer and he is laundering your money but if you don&#039;t risk you end up being a middle man for the rest of your life.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve read about these anonymous European debit cards that have an IBAN account linked to them. Pretty sure there are some for sale on the road itself. Essentially you register them online under a false name, deposit funds onto the account via the SEPA deposits most European BTC exchange websites offer, then walk down to a cash point and withdraw the money. You only get stung like 1.5% or something if I remember correctly since technically you&#039;re withdrawing money abroad (according to the card issuer). Might be worth a look?<br /><br />Other than that, yeah, localbitcoins is an option.

				Thanks for all the replies guys. Localbitcoins looks like a good one, bitcoins for cash seems pretty anonymous. I suppose its just a matter of trusting the person you are dealing with though?
