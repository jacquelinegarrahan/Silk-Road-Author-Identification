				My TorPM account was compromised! Do not believe any messages from DigitalAlch on torpm as of 6/21. I also would like to note this pass was not used elsewhere and can not be dictionary attacked.. its 16 characters and included special characters. This is the reason I will only communicate via PGP. If it is not from me then do not believe it! <br /><br />Pissed off,<br />DigitalAlch
