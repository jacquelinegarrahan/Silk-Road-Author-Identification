I looked at his profile on the SR forums and he hasn&#039;t said anything since SR was shutdown. However if anyone knows anything about Tesselated&#039;s current situation, I am very eager to know.

				I am waiting for registration to open up so I can see this.&nbsp; It may or may not be real, here&#039;s hoping.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve found Tess then you sir are a fucking scholar.&nbsp; Thank you.

The store has way too much stuff in it, maybe Tessellated teamed up with other vendors to open a new shop? It is a possibility

				He has a bunch of other products. Tess seemed to like to keep his operation tight, not too many listings and was slow and careful with the amount of product he sold. <br /><br />This guy could have just pulled the pictures from the listings on SR or perhaps is re-selling legitimate Tessellated blotter.
