				Hello everyone,<br /><br />Yesterday i have registered on SR and sent coins to my deposit address, as displayed under &quot;account&quot;. It is 14 hours later now and the transferred coins are still not on my SR account. According to blockchain explorer, the transfer has 88 confirmations at the moment. Did any of you experience a similar problem? I&#039;ve contacted support and hope that they&#039;ll be able to make my coins accessible to me.

				I&#039;ve had this happen to me once before, but it wasn&#039;t for nearly as long. Hopefully SR support can get it figured out for you without any problems. <br /><br />sdesu

				Dude don&#039;t trip I made a thread and everything too yesterday about my coins not showing up. It took 21hours for mine to show up. As long as you know for sure you gave the bitcoin company the correct info, they&#039;ll show up. I was getting nervous thinking my coins were lost in the internet black hole but they came through. Patience and time......

				Seems like everyone is making this same exact thread&nbsp; :P<br />I don&#039;t blame you, I guess, because it is extremely worrisome not knowing where your coins are! This same problem is occurring with a bunch of us right now, including myself. I think most of us have contacted SR support, so they are probably really backed up right now trying to read/respond to the flood of messages. I&#039;m sure SR support will get this all sorted out! Just know that you aren&#039;t alone in this. And I&#039;m sure we will all get our coins soon.&nbsp; :D <br />Good luck!

				Thank you all for your replies. It is a relief to hear that i&#039;m not alone with that problem. And waiting for the coins is much easier now.
