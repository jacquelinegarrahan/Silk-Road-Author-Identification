				A big problem with bitcoins is they are IP logged but that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they can trace them to a drug transaction online. What are the legalities of the governments (USA+Canada) of becoming dealers on silkroad and simply doing controlled deliveries?

				Run your client over Tor.<br /><br />That problem is easy to fix. To me, the main problem with bitcoin is that only people with computing devices and internet access can use it. I mean, theoretically you could walk around with a paper wallet, and publish transactions by making carrier pigeons deliver pieces of paper with transaction IDs to a physical block chain, chiseled on the side of a mountain,&nbsp; but that would be impractical.<br /><br />So over half the world&#039;s population is excluded from using this freedom-promoting technology.<br />

Bitcoin was invented to provide as close to the same level of freedom and anonymity online as one would have using cash for transactions in real life. In the same way it would be hard to trace a particular $20 bill found in a drug dealer&#039;s pocket back to you, Bitcoin was meant to be similarly anonymous.Why would people with no access to the internet need a digital currency? What would they spend it on? If they are doing something illegal they could just pay with cash...

				I remember when I came on it was after the bitcoin had fell like falling ice of sky crappers. I can&#039;t believe they were a couple a bucks not so long ago.

				The reason the coins dropped a couple years back so much is MTGox was hacked and coins were stolen enmasse.<br />There was another high-profile wallet theft last year.<br />These depressed the price the most, as the bitcoin speculators largely gave up.<br />The rest was a lack of confidence.<br />There will only be so many bitcoins mined, and they are currently mining with half the rewards they got before - AND the difficulty is constantly increasing.<br />So they can only really go up in the long term.<br /><br />The other thing, is that the exchange is VERY fluid, so if one of our major vendors or DPR were to cash out and set their bitcoin prices cheap, it would depress the price of bitcoins across the board.<br />The sellers of coins have the price in their hands, if they want them to be something, they have to cash them out knowing they need to set a firm price, not much lower than the average, and can&#039;t dump them all at once.<br /><br />Small amounts won&#039;t make a huge difference, but the folks with big stashes can really mess with it all.<br />If you&#039;re a buyer of coins, buy and spend as fast as you can to minimize risks of it going down.
