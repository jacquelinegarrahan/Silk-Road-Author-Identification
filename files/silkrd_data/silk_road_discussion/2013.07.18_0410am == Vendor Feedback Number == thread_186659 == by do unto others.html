				Hello everyone. I was just curious how long until I will get a feedback score next to my name? I have done almost twenty transactions so far, all 5/5 feedback but still dont have a score shown. Is there a dollar amount I must reach? Also, what are the requrements to get to be able to read the vendors forum?<br /><br />Thanks for any input.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Checked out your vendor page, 100% stats, feedback going back a month; Might have something to do with many of your feedbacks being for items no longer listed. However, there is feedback on some of your items? It could be me, but the feedback looks a little odd.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m definitely not accusing you of anything, I&#039;m just curious by nature, no offence intended! I&#039;ve seen similar before with another vendor who made a whole bunch of listings, put them in stealth mode at a really low price, bought them himself with dummy buyer accounts, jacked up his feedback, and then raised the price and made the listings public. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe you&#039;ve inadvertantly triggered an automated security feature :(<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d message SR Vendor Support, because you really should have a score if you&#039;ve been selling pills at that price, I would think.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Vendor forum access reqs are min. 6 weeks vending, 30 successful transactions totaling at least $1500. It&#039;s the same for your bond, you get rewarded with both. Check your sellers guide for details.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Best of luck, AB.

The detailed requirements are up somewhere like the wiki or...

No offense taken. I realize there are a lot shady vendors and a lot of different scams vnedors can pull to get a good score going. I can promise you I have done none of these things. I have never bought an item from myself. Im sure sr could look into this and figure it out if they really wanted to. <br /><br />thanks to everyone who commented.
