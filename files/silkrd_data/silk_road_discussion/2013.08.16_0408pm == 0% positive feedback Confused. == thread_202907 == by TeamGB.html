				I just receive my shipment of Pre Ban Mephedrone from: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a6d511b6bb<br /><br />I felt I was taking a risk as there seems to be something wrong with their Feedback ratings. My order was shipped the same day and was delivered 2 days later. The product is amazing and to boot the vendor added 1G free to my order.<br /><br />I gave him 5/5 feedback yet his score is still: ranked in the top 80% of sellers with 0% positive feedback from 201 transactions<br />has 90 fans.<br /><br />What is going on?

				In case I didn&#039;t make it clear enough...<br /><br />I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS VENDOR. Just trying to work out why their feedback is such.

				I am going to guess that is because there is not much recent feedback, something like last four months?

				don&#039;t vendors loose their feedback score if they haven&#039;t vended in 4 (?) months?&nbsp; It could be that they&#039;ve taken a break and while they&#039;ve kept their ranking, they&#039;ve lost the feedback.&nbsp; If I&#039;m right, their vendor page should show you how many sales they&#039;ve made recently.<br /><br />or I could just be talking out my arse as I have no idea.

				That&#039;s absolutely correct.&nbsp; There are several vendors who I LOVE that don&#039;t have a current feedback rating due to the current system.
