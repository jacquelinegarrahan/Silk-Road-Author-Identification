				New user here. I found SR after (skeptically) researching &#039;deep web&#039;. <br />I jumped through the hoops- registering, getting Bitcoins, etc. At each step I though for sure <br />i was being scammed or that it just would not work out.<br />After placing first order- very nervous. Kept thinking either it wouldn&#039;t arrive (checked box<br />every damn day) or that I would be arrested. <br />In my mind I pictured being arrested, losing job, family shame, wife divorcing me etc.<br />and then my package came. and it was perfect. I was just blown away by the packaging. Really ingenious.<br /><br />then of course I thought, &quot;what if this stuff is fake/counterfeit? what if it&#039;s rat poison? what if...what if&quot;<br />but so far so good. <br />I was just really impressed by everything. <br />this is truly power to the people. <br /><br />thanks everyone.

				I must be weird...I was never worried or skeptical about this site. It just makes sense. We are in a point in time where it makes perfect sense that there would be a website like this with a real community that actually cares for its vendors and customers. This place is the future. I really do hope it will see many more years. The only problem I see is that every community that gets bigger and bigger it starts to lose those small town qualities. Communication like this forum is essential in making sure this place really thrives.

				I wasn&#039;t skeptical about getting my orders, the honest feedback people provide help keep sellers honest.<br /><br />When I heard about this place, I had to place an order to try it out.

				wow...perhaps with the aid of yet another successful SR purchase,&nbsp; feel a little of what ALL of ya are saying....getting your first order IS like getting your cherry popped.....6 months ago that was me, now up to 40+ successful transactions and two unsuccessful (both fully refunded and I have zero belief that the packages were even shipped, so I do not suspect an intercept). I remember the first time I parachuted, I looked up at the canopy and my instinctive reaction was &quot;holy shit, it worked&quot;, so I know where the OP is coming from.<br /><br />On the other hand, that&#039;s all because of the way we&#039;ve been conditioned to react to the substances we enjoy. SR does make sense, as one dude said. Having to skulk around like a criminal to get overcharged for some shitty brick weed and facing the possibility of the same &quot;inconveniences&quot; mentioned above and possibly becoming a heavy burden to the taxpayer doesn&#039;t make any fucking sense at all.<br /><br />No one has been caused any inconvenience as a result of any of my transactions on The Silk Road. <br /><br />But, many a friend has smiled and laughed until they pissed their pants.......WTF is wrong with this picture? Time to pack a bowl....

				Here&#039;s how I see it: government wants to control and will always try to become larger and more powerful.<br />this is why we have checks and balances (thank you founding fathers); however, when govt gets involved in something it becomes a deal with devil. if something costs them money (junkies in Emergency rooms, people on disability, medicaid etc) they are going to see it as their right to control drugs, money etc. (Especially if they aren&#039;t getting their cut of the money that is exchanged!)<br />when people OD, there are always parents or loved ones who want govt to &#039;do something&#039;; however these short term feel-good laws have long-term problems. for example I recently served on a jury where a guy was accused of possessing weapons on school grounds. the weapon was pen knife and the &#039;school grounds&#039; was a frat house. I argued that the law was unjust (tho technically dude was guilty) and many of the other jurors agreed with me.

				Toasting in epic thread.<br /><br />I literally had the same thoughts as OP during my first shipment. Wasnt worried about the seller (his feedback profile was perfect) but worried about interception, arrest, and all that of course.<br /><br />Everything went perfect and I love this amazing site.<br /><br />Thank you thank you to the creators of TOR, the Japanese guy that invented Bitcoins, and the SR staff for making all this possible. For a guy like myself with no &quot;connections&quot; it&#039;s so nice to have a way for responsible adults to enjoy themselves and relieve some freaking stress from our everyday lives. Thanks again!

				SR is great.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lost thousands dealing with strangers over the years,including net based transactions, and so far SR has done nothing but get me more than I paid for (NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN MY LIFE)<br /><br />You can purchase a 1/4 of MJ you actually want,not just whatever the dirty kid down the street has, and get 8 grams, not six! And the strain name you hear actually matches the weed!&nbsp; The popular vendors on here are popular for a good reason.&nbsp; Some real standup guys on here.
