				hey, so I&#039;m new to SR and really looking forward to purchasing goods, but what looked pretty simple at first has now become rather complicated after looking through all the posts and noob guides.&nbsp; My level of computer expertise is intermediate/above average.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to encryption software, but I&#039;m picking it up rather quickly and successfully.&nbsp; That being said, I don&#039;t want to start off my SR experience completely wrong, get a bad reputation and get black-balled, etc.&nbsp; So... if there is anyone willing to work with me on the side - one-on-one - to help me step by step, that would be really amazing (if this is a dumb request cause a fed might try and lure me into a trap, someone say so).&nbsp; My knowledge doesn&#039;t go much farther than i2p and TOR, I still need learn GPG (PGP?) communications, and the whole bitcoin thing... If anyone is willing to work with me, and be patient with me if I ask a lot of dumb ass noob questions, please hit me up so I can start of my SR experience correctly.&nbsp; <br /><br />If this is in the wrong forum, please let me know, I wasn&#039;t sure where to put it.&nbsp; If this is a really stupid request because i could be lured by a fed, also let me know...

				Entry onto the final level of silk road requires beating the end of level baddy.<br />You have to learn the moves to defeat him.<br />Take it slowly, step by step.<br />Learn the basics, read the guides, use common sence.<br />There are some really cool people on the forums will help you but you need to form basic understandings first.<br /><br />Before walking down the road, check the weather forecast - you will know what too wear.<br /><br />Too stoned.

				I would carefully read the Buyer&#039;s Guide here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />It covers a lot of the questions you put in your post, and especially look at the Buyer&#039;s Guide on that page in addition to the PGP/GPG page.&nbsp; I hope it clears up some questions for you<br /><br />

				If you find it troubling to order drugs with a simple method like TOR, I suggest you stay sober. Might fail at dosing. :P

				I&#039;m new as well. Hopefully I can start buying soon. I definitely don&#039;t want to miss any steps. Better to be safe than sorry.
