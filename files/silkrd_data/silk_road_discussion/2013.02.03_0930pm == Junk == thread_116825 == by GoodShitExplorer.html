				If you&#039;re lucky enough to have that &quot;twin soul&quot; connection with someone, sex is like a constant acid trip every time. Combine that connection with actual LSD and I can&#039;t imagine what it would be like 0_0

				Hahahaha this thread cracked me up!!!&nbsp; ;D..... I love sex on all psychedelics but I&#039;d have to say acid is the best... (Sadly) If I&#039;m sober I can&#039;t last that long, I don&#039;t know why but it feels like I can&#039;t control it :/.... On most other drugs like pills, booze, coke I either won&#039;t be able to get hard or if I can then it takes me foreverrrrr to come or I just won&#039;t be able to at all :/..... But acid, I can CONTROL it!!!!!!! Climaxing and the same time as my girl is so beautiful, especially when everything is already so beautiful because were both trippinnnnnnn, mushrooms are fun too but I find myself not being able to come at all a lot of the times :/.... Gotta love sex on some good x too!!!!!
