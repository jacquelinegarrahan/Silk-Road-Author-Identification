				In addition to the interview with DPR it seems Forbes undertook a side by side comparison on what it&#039;s like to buy drugs on the three main anonymous black markets.<br />Seems they bought 1G weed from &quot;the dope man&quot; pity he took so long to ship as it seems in their view Atlantis was better and faster. <br /><br />But perhaps the dope man should look at his stealth in case this brings any extra scrutiny to him, I&#039;m pretty sure they did their job as journalists and didn&#039;t inform LE of the packaging but you never know.<br /><br />Here is the article. Clearnet* http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/heres-what-its-like-to-buy-drugs-on-three-anonymous-online-black-markets/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The hardest part of scoring drugs in the age of the digital black market? Choosing among all the consumer-friendly websites ready to sell them.<br /><br />As I was reporting my profile of the Dread Pirate Roberts, the entrepreneur behind the booming Silk Road black market for illegal drugs, Forbes tested the Bitcoin-based drug-buying process on the three most well-known online anonymous black markets: The Silk Road, Atlantis and Black Market Reloaded. Though we purchased only small amounts of marijuana, harder drugs such as heroin and crack seemed to be just as readily available.<br /><br />Our results were mixed, and far from scientific, since we made only one buy per site, and each site hosts dozens or hundreds of vendors. (The sites’ third-party seller model is more akin to eBay and Etsy than Amazon or Zappos.) We also couldn’t test the quality of the products–Our lawyer insisted we destroy them. (See video below.) But this much is clear: the age of narcotics e-commerce has arrived.<br /><br />Silk Road<br />Product: Grape God, One Gram<br />Vendor: The DOPE Man<br />Price: $24*<br />Shipping time: 6 business days<br />Packaging: Double vacuum seal<br />How it was advertised (left) versus what we got:<br /><br />Consumer experience: Not ideal. The DOPE Man insists customers release their payment escrow before the product arrives, despite Silk Road’s rules to the contrary.<br /><br /><br />Atlantis<br /><br />Product: Snow White Kush, One Gram<br />Vendor: Adventure Time Supplies<br />Price: $23*<br />Shipping time: 2 business days<br />Packaging: Triple vacuum seal<br />How it was advertised (left) versus what we got:<br /><br />Consumer experience: Impressive. Adventure Time ships its pot fast.<br /><br /><br />Black Market Reloaded<br /><br />Product: Pre-rolled Joints of Haze, .5 Grams<br />Vendor: Dr. Earnhardt<br />Price: $9*<br />Shipping time: Never arrived<br />Packaging: N/A<br />How it was advertised (left) versus what we got:<br /><br />Consumer experience: Poor. Dr. Earnhardt, based in the Netherlands, was the only vendor we found on BMR selling small amounts of marijuana. The package may have been caught by customs.<br /><br />*Approx. based on early July Bitcoin values.<br /><br />Video taking about the process and them flushing the lovely weed&nbsp; :-[<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCpMFpHGWB0<br />

				This is pretty awesome! I&#039;m sure there are just as many great vendors on Silk Road. I&#039;ve had a sale planned on Atlantis for a week that just happens to be starting tonight at midnight, so I&#039;m stoked with the timing. I&#039;ll be on Silk Road eventually, but the timing isn&#039;t quite right yet.
