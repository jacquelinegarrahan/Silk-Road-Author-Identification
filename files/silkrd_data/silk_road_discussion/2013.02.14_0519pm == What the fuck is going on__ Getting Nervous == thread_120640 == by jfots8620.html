				I said it before and I&#039;ll say it again there is no way LE would do anything to arouse suspicions, this is just a massive coincidence. Think about it if you were a dealer be now all your stash would be long gone with having no mail but if your mail comes as normal you carry as normal and thats what LE want for you to carry on as normal.<br /><br />Just paranoia getting the best of you, it happens....:)

				Bro trust me i knw the feeling I HATE IT!!! im use to haveing a package a coulle times&nbsp; a week since i started ordering non stop since Nov..Iv had times where mymail box is packaed everyday..<br /><br />One day i had 4 packs in one day and still every day rest of the week something came in...I just put in my 1st order in a half month Wednesday..<br /><br />But bro the mail USPS IS FUCKING UP RIGHT NOW!!! THE P O workers are protesting some r refusing to work, all about that SATurday delivery shit.. Even tracking is fucked up big time man..<br /><br />I had packages sent friday arrive saturday, i look at the tracking and it said it was still in the state it was sentfrom... lol..<br /><br />The new tracking has really fucked things up IMO at this point the DCN WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER..<br /><br />But mail has been slower, like i said i can show u a link where in&nbsp; NY P O &#039;s would not even take ppls packages unless it was 1stclass just to drop off , if they had to do anything they would ..its fucked up time for USPS right now... But hopefully it all works for u bro..<br /><br />PRAY TO THE MAIL GODS!! lol

				Maybe there is something up with your mail some where along the line and the PO have not picked up on it yet but its nothing to do with a package being intercepted as I say this would never happen EVER! <br /><br />It just would not make any logical sense to stop all mail going to your address the LE are basically saying ok get rid of everything because were coming to get you, honest you will look back in a few days and laugh.

				&nbsp;i just got off phone with po and he said shouldnt worry about it and that usps has been having issues!! and i would think if ne pkg was intercepted at post office that he would be first one to know! just really sucks waiting ,when last two months my packs have been coming in FAST!! lol just tried to post this and received newest post, i sure hope im laughing come tomorrow or saturday.. this is like back in day handing dude ur money to go get ur drugs. although u no dude will be back theres always the thought in back of ur mind.. and minutes seem like hours ,kinda like days seems like weeks waiting for pkg.. arghhh lol

				Yeah Im sure the usps workers are all disgruntled knowing soon their pay and benefit packages will be getting in line with the rest of everyone else..Soon the new American race to the bottom will include them as well.Then we shall see how much the postal worker gives a shit about being aware of suspicious packages.

				Remember : you&#039;re 32 for 32, which means you received a lot of packages of all sorts of drugs of which you might have consumed some if not all. And a lot of drugs induce paranoïa :)<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry, be happy.<br />

				Glad to see this post, was getting worried about my mail I didnt even get anything today, but looks like I&#039;m not alone in that usps seems to be fucked up and the orders im waiting on both vendors have slow shipping times at the moment so the combination of those two things is why im havent received my stuff yet thanks for putting my mind at rest :)
