				I&#039;ve been a member of the SR community for about 3 months now and only lurking around on the message board.. I have around 10 successful buying transactions (+$2000)<br /><br />Anyway I just thought I&#039;d say to the Mods that they did a fabulous job keeping us all updated on the status of the Road.. Downtime happens on every single site on the Web, and USUALLY you never hear anything about what the problem is.<br /><br />IMHO I don&#039;t think the Mods could have done a better job if they hired a professional to speak on their behalf... HUGE thumbs up fellas!<br /><br />-Bomb

				As one of the few people who has been on SR since before the first gawker-boom(which the servers handled quite well, by the way), I can comfortably say that anyone who thinks this situation was handled badly is a bit of an idiot. The problem is the mass-panic that turned most folks, like JezuzWazaMushroom, into scared rats looking for any exit they could find.

Don&#039;t freak out just because it goes down. The only time it is okay to freak out is when no one knows anything about what is wrong and only after three days of it being down. That is when you should get worried. When the staff as chiming in to say things are fine and it&#039;ll be back up, that is when you sit down and wait patiently for at least a week before you begin to suspect foul play.

				Like I said, all they had to do, which they did through inigo, was tell us &quot;it&#039;s all okay&quot; and that should be sufficient. IF they said ARF ARF GOTCHA, then people would have the right to go AWOL in the head. I stood to lose 2K of a mates coin but even then I was cautiously optimistic having been a member for some time, about waiting for something official, but one cannot help but be a bit concerned after 24hrs and nothing and crazy cunts saying shit like DPR&#039;s been arrested blah blah blah. I&#039;d say the Admin guys were trying to fix it and when they couldn&#039;t they then posted everything was cool and DPR would fix shit when he gets back from his well deserved break. Banks go down for maintenance, shit, even motherfucking YouTube does and they say the same thing the SR site says now, closed for maintenance. What more do people want? I&#039;ve been battling iHateNiggers about this issue and he seems like the most unnappreciative queer cunt in the world and I would hate to have to be related to him in real life, I&#039;s disown him!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70744.msg582890#msg582890">Quote from: quinone on November 12, 2012, 03:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70744.msg582712#msg582712">Quote from: JezuzWazaMushroom on November 12, 2012, 02:51 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Again, see comment stating you wouldn&#039;t be saying that if you were a vendor, and although I&#039;m not, I have close to $2K sitting there, orders to make on behalf of others, and all we got until inigo&#039;s post was...

				Well one reputable vendor alone that I was PMing said that they had 1200 BTC&#039;s in there and they had just started. When you&#039;re running a business like that one day could have you with 20k alone&#039;s worth.
