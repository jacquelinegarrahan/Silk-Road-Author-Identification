				I jut opened my seller&#039;s account a few weeks ago and have now worked out the kinks enough to where I can start vending. Here&#039;s my question: Basically I have it set to where my listings are pegged to the US Dollar, but when I made a posting for my first listing, it didn&#039;t ask my for a USD value, but a BTC value, so I entered what was worth what I wanted it to be, but in BTC. So should I have seen an option for posting in USD or something? Or do you just enter that value that it is at that time (i.e. list an ite at 1 BTC while they are worth $100 if that it was you want out of it)? Little confused here. Any help would be appreciated. Also, how do I find the link to the page that has my User Profile so I can link it here?

				Account&gt;Settings&gt;<br /><br />Click &quot;display prices in Dollars&quot;<br /><br />The other thing you might consider is post commission pricing so the buyer pays what he sees and no surprises at checkout. Doing it this way, you have to factor in the commission when figuring your net profit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best wishes selling. It can be a lot of fun. Don&#039;t obsess too much about your rating. Just do the best you can with each order.

				Yup, the above sums it up pretty nicely! :) For some reason I thought you already had your prices displayed in dollars! :-[ Tired Libertas - apologies!!<br /><br />
