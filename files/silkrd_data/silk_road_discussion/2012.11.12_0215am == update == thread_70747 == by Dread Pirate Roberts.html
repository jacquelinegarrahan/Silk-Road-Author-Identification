				UPDATE (2351 UTC 11/16/2012): Registrations are open again.&nbsp; Been monitoring the new set up and we are well within capacity, so we are going to open it up again (sorry to everyone left out in the cold the past few days).&nbsp; Still working out a few bugs, but it looks like we are pretty much back on track folks.&nbsp; I&#039;ll leave this thread pinned for now in case anything comes up in the next few days.&nbsp; I hope to see all of you at movie night tonight :)&nbsp; (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=69283.0)<br /><br />UPDATE (0225 UTC 11/16/2012): Withdrawals are up to date, so if you sent a withdrawal and it is taking much longer than usual to show up, please contact support so we can investigate.&nbsp; Still a few things to iron out with the site (people getting logged off, etc), but I think we are just about there.<br /><br />UPDATE (2326 UTC 11/15/2012): Might not have to take the site down after all.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you know here if we do.&nbsp; A side note about withdrawals:&nbsp; There have been a ton of them (understandable), so we are getting through them as fast as possible.&nbsp; Please be patient if we haven&#039;t gotten to yours yet.<br /><br />UPDATE (2254 UTC 11/15/2012): The site went down again and there are people claiming to be responsible for it and making threats.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to take any chances, so the site is going to come down for a bit while we investigate what is going on.&nbsp; Hopefully this is short lived... what drama!&nbsp; Next update will come before 0600 UTC.<br /><br />UPDATE (2355 UTC): Deposits are working.&nbsp; All outstanding deposits have been processed, and future deposits will be processed as usual.&nbsp; If you sent a deposit before or during the outage and your account has not been credited, message support so we can investigate your issue.&nbsp; Some withdrawals have been processed, but there is still a queue we are working through.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update when withdrawals are back to normal.<br /><br />UPDATE (2052 UTC): Current members now have full access to Silk Road.&nbsp; Registrations are still closed until we are certain we can handle the additional traffic.&nbsp; We are still unable to process deposits and withdrawals, but are getting very close.&nbsp; I will start a new thread with some commentary on this whole situation once we are running 100%.<br /><br />UPDATE(0850 UTC): Silk Road is available once again, but on a limited basis.&nbsp; New user registrations are closed for the time being.&nbsp; Access is limited to vendors only.&nbsp; New deposits and withdrawals (and any that were sent just before or during the outage) will not be processed until some time in the next 24 hours.&nbsp; Assuming all goes well, access for all current members will be made available some time in the next 24 hours.<br /><br />UPDATE (0012 UTC):&nbsp; Sorry I&#039;m late on this update, won&#039;t happen again.&nbsp; We&#039;re pretty much polishing and going down the final check list at this point.&nbsp; I&#039;m confident we&#039;ll make our &quot;matter of days&quot; estimate and this won&#039;t be drawn out into week+ territory (assuming nothing goes wrong when we reopen).&nbsp; When we reopen, access will be limited to vendors only for a few hours so they can mark packages shipped that were sent but not marked before we went down.&nbsp; Also, auto-finalize and auto-vacation haven&#039;t been running since Sunday, and we won&#039;t fire those back up for a couple of days after we reopen so everyone can get square first.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait till this is behind us :)&nbsp; Next update before 1500 UTC Wednesday.<br /><br />UPDATE (1113 UTC): I and the team need sleep.&nbsp; Getting really close now, home stretch (hopefully).&nbsp; Next update will come before 2300 UTC, Tuesday.<br /><br />UPDATE (0924 UTC): I know you won&#039;t like hearing this, but we aren&#039;t quite there yet.&nbsp; We are working hard and getting closer though.&nbsp; Next update will come before 1600 UTC.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Hello everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m alive, I&#039;m safe.&nbsp; Luck would have it that the first time I&#039;m away for more than 24 hours, the site goes down and I&#039;m the only one that can bring it back up.&nbsp; As soon as we are sure there haven&#039;t been any security breaches and taken all of the necessary precautions, we will get back up and running.&nbsp; If anyone&#039;s orders get messed up because of this (auto-finalizing, etc), we will take full responsibility and make things right, just contact support once we&#039;re back up.&nbsp; I&#039;m terribly sorry for this and all of the recent problems.&nbsp; I promise it is my top priority to get things running smoothly again.<br /><br />- -DPR<br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQoFuwAAoJEAIiQjtnt/ol4UQH/A5MqY7NTV+J9YHF2f4QMB+1<br />zvAYp7zpsJqJFwVTgjDnsGM1QJeWZpdDyr0HYKk5DbfanBmbvWVn9FPFeG9PXglz<br />Y9wtnNbAe3H3a8swq72Mc/SwsV0QGHuM4n6Y6HvQkQfny/+FiInvYFZti0qlEcHB<br />RlWCWI4JxNtM9XHscIF9+nc7stBo9VnkmT89x9fAoUEMFWVyRykBb+vkK/J7CKqM<br />lWoSmglJ0UIojAWV54oKtNK8y9ur6QYHoT5JfRSlZRpHsJOOZPGPqnOob2GWIrVH<br />IiHb0tivUhJRn/rUARQ6SXSFTWHeFDUvglrh6jAQEv+CW8JRBsowJrg+z8Zysns=<br />=0g67<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

Rest assured that most of us knew everything was fine, so don&#039;t let the crazies represent the majority.

				No Nigger boy, however I will say this regarding your clear obsession with the Negro race...<br /><br />Nothing optional—from homosexuality to adultery—is ever made punishable unless those who do the prohibiting (and exact the fierce punishments) have a repressed desire to participate.

I greatly appreciate everything that is done to keep SR working the way it does. I can&#039;t believe how many ignorant assholes take this site and what you do for granted, without you there would be no SR, not just for a couple days but at all! Keep up the good work and take all the time needed to make sure SR comes back as safe and secure as it was, there is no need to rush a delicate process because some people on here have no patience whatsoever, I cannot believe some of the outrageous posts people have been putting up lately.<br />&nbsp;Love what you do, ignore the haters!<br />Stove

Now i understand shit happens. i watch movies so i understand.&nbsp; But pirate or dpr, whatever you prefer, dude if this shit is gonna last weeks or months you gotta pirate up and let us sailors know so we can navigate what ship to sail. There are other options, sure no way as good as yours but a junkie&#039;s gotta do what a junkie&#039;s gotta do. Am i asking too much? Is having money tied up with no response as to when i can access my money cool in the eyes of every SR user here degrading those of us that dare question wtf this will be fixed if ever?<br />side note, wtf as far as i know stands for &quot;what the fuck&quot;.

I&#039;d recommend getting someone to cover for you while you&#039;re gone, but considering the industry you&#039;re in I can&#039;t say it&#039;s the smartest idea; three men can keep a secret if two of them are dead.

				Glad to see this update after trying to login and see the error that SR not found on the server.<br /><br />Its times like this that make me think SR needs a sister site. When one site goes down, for whatever reason, the second site is still accessible. Vendors can advertise on both sites for the one join fee and buyers will always have access to their wares.

				Like people have said, you assume he can just hire new employees and use standard infrastructure as one would on the world wide web but Darknet&#039;s completely different. If he was going to disappear with your cash he would have, and finally you do owe him because like I said before, how much money have you made because he was thoughtful enough to give you a place to flog your wares to the whole world and not just your local hood. Think about it, Sony goes down from time to time, Banks close their sites for maintenance that hold your money but do you abuse the shit out of the bank manager or shareholders because of it. YouTube, as well as every site has to do things from time to time, and they aren&#039;t being attacked by every LE office in the world. You have to remember who his adversaries are, NSA, MI5&amp;6, Interpol and many others are all attempting to penetrate the system to shut it down. You dude, need to smoke some DMT it will make you a better person!

				Hey! Just wanted to say thank you DPR! And anyone else getting things set straight again.<br />Also piss off, haters and complainers. Stop fucking whining about SR being down. Be thankful you even got SR. If you&#039;re so eager to log back in that you feel the need to say something rude on the forums, you should be the one trying to implement an underground market of items banned by most societies without getting caught. Think you lost money? Well that comes with the price of being involved with it. You signed up and you should of well known that there isn&#039;t no goin downtown to the store to get a refund. I lost five hundo $. Life rolls on. Live with it.<br />This aint yo fucking amazon. Give people/DPR a break.<br />Glad we will be back up and running soon!<br /><br />Thanks again.

				DPR, thanks for update, all I can say is that I understand: if this is one-man operation (and it seems it is), scalability problems demand very good expertise in the field. I know because I run one fairly large site where I had similar problems, still I guess it&#039;s much much smaller than SR.<br /><br />I hope everything will be ok... I need that DMT asap ;)

				It&#039;s no that I can&#039;t actually afford to pay back a dirty rotten $1500 dollars, it&#039;s that it&#039;s the last thing I want to have to do with $1500. $1500 is $1500 and why would I want it going somewhere it shouldn&#039;t when it could feed a starving child or something? I actually have $2K in there TBH, and let me tell you a secret why millionaire&#039;s stay millionaire&#039;s, because they&#039;re not frivolous with it and they spend other peoples money not their own and the good ones put it all into tax deductible charities like myself. <br /><br />One year Kerry Packer (Australia&#039;s deceased former wealthiest person) paid $84 in tax. One of Australia&#039;s most well known gangster cum celebrity types Mick Gatto, operates a &quot;industrial dispute resolution&quot; business that although he drives an E63 AMG (I myself drive an S-Class but a Kompressor 3.5L with the 7sp G-Tronic box because it&#039;s not for racing it&#039;s a family car) and has holiday houses all over the place, posted an overall loss for the year of something like 27K a couple of years back to not pay tax. Look at Warren Buffet who still lives in the same house he bought a million years ago and yet still wouldn&#039;t give his kids anything more than an education of the highest standard. Buffets really nice grand daughter whom he&#039;s disowned for her part in a documentary shows how twisted some get by money and what they do with it. My point is this, smart people with money never actually spend money because after a certain point your milking your investments and putting it down to tax. Oh you&#039;re having a party, no you&#039;re not you&#039;re having a &quot;company dinner which just happens to require magicians and &quot;exotic dancers&quot; to win over a prospective investment partner&quot; but nobody there invested after seeing it wasn&#039;t viable for their portfolio due to unseen circumstances&quot; lol. <br /><br />One day I was talking with this drug dealer idiot with bling all over him and was even getting fucking gems in his tooth FFS, (retard rich kid) who was going on about how rich he was and that he never leaves the house without ten grand on his person for &quot;just in case&quot; and I said I&#039;ll bet you what you have on you right now that I&#039;m worth more than you and I only have $150 in my wallet &quot;just in case&quot; we&#039;ll do this by comparing who has the largest bank account. He said &quot;I have lots of bank accounts&quot; so I said alright how about who has the access to the most cash or credit at a casino right now accessible to us with with what cards we had on us (it felt like playing Pokemon or whatever that Manga card game cartoon is kids watch with him) so off to Crown Jupiters we went since he didn&#039;t believe me and I wouldn&#039;t show him mine till we got there. He converted his cash to chips and I went and organised the same in value to pretend like I didn&#039;t know something he didn&#039;t, and went back over to where our friends were hanging out chatting about it as they had all become very interested in our wager, I guess it was one of those who had the biggest cocks in the room type things, then publicly with everyone we went to the floor manager and pulled out our cocks and he had an AMEX Platinum which he thought was the bomb, until I pulled out something very few people have, like a big cock, my AMEX Centurion Card. The Centurion Card is something you have to be invited to get by meeting certain wealth and spending criteria and just to have it costs me money every year for the security of being anywhere in the world and being able to buy a house if I want let alone just get a shit load of gold if the world looks like it&#039;s going to get fucked and go into hiding. Needless to say he was fucking ropable about it and I took his chips anyway and sent the money to an organisation I know he hates in his name too and showed him the receipt scan through Facebook, an organisation that supports the Palestinian people (because he&#039;s a Jew boy) but Fatah not HAMAS. <br /><br />So I think you can deduce for yourself it was a figure of speech dude. I&#039;d sooner rather give it to a kid with cancer&#039;s family who are eating baked beans every night for dinner to pay for his care than a millionaire criminal who stole it for no reason, which isn&#039;t too far from the truth so make of that what you will, the cancer bit I mean. My mate&#039;s bills are so bad that he&#039;s ordering MDMA to flog off to pay for it. I&#039;ve offered to give him money but the cunt is too proud to accept charity, it&#039;s hard to watch. Mind you their not eating baked beans every night, but they haven&#039;t been able to go out to dinner in over a year (except my restaurant when I made them saying it was an invitation with other people to socialize, again because of his pride he says it&#039;s not my place to feed) from expenses and with his tax return he hopes to turn it into something decent because of the over inflated price of chems here. I&#039;m not going to act like I earned my wealth, it&#039;s generational but I can&#039;t help what I was born into, but unlike much of the %1 my heart lies with the Ron Paul rEVOLution, everyone and everything, and I have traveled a lot so therefore have a social conscience plus using psychedelics and going to Burning Man forces me to feel sick when I know the way &quot;they&quot; operate everything. <br /><br />However unlike in America, in Australia there&#039;s a balance of power between us and the Jews, we won&#039;t let them control our Fed etc thanks to people who go to schools similar to where I attended (St. Josephs) but I&#039;ve never seen any of David Icke&#039;s lizard people, and if I you knew some of the owners of business and politicians I know you would be surprised that they aren&#039;t in fact some form of reptilian creatures because they&#039;re cold blooded no doubt. The problem with our system though, is the Jews control our media and therefore keep the people locked in this mentality of a Left/Right paradigm mentality of thinking. <br /><br />I can tell you %100 from organisations the oldies were and still are members of and therefore dragged me into having involvement with at functions etc that I hate, that the mega rich are all in bed with each other and are about global control for themselves and their, the great grandfather started a mining company and we employ thousands of people now and made the bulk of our money from the smart old cunts prospecting skills and organising capacity to get the shit out of the ground and off to the rest of the world, and instead of paying transport companies to ship it went and started them too and shit just grew and grew. So that&#039;s why I said I&#039;m a fair but wealthier than even DPR I&#039;d say but no where near as intelligent or plain brilliant. I have nothing to do with any of &quot;them&quot; and I would do anything I can to establish Libertarianism world wide. <br /><br />So you don&#039;t think we&#039;re bankers or something our family built it&#039;s wealth out of hard work and caring for employees above all and I stretch that further to say that I will be doing everything I can to support people like the Libertarians world wide and those less fortunate. <br /><br />Here&#039;s two reasons exactly why the War On Drugs is bullshit, three actually, my mate is struggling for medical care because there&#039;s not enough state money that could easily pay for these things with war on drug expense/taxes, he&#039;s risking his life to save the life of his child and possibly his relationship, and if it&#039;s intercepted he won&#039;t be there to possibly see his child&#039;s small amount of time left. And if that were to occur the cops would paste in on their Facebook page and the Newspaper as a victory while at the same time demonizing an innocent man trying to help his family. Then we have to put up with queer cunts like that iHateNiggers CUNT who goes on about how hard it is for him because he&#039;s been locked out from Silk Road as if it&#039;s his right to use it at all when it was a gift to the world from DPR. FUCK I need to go and have a cone, but I hope this clarifies my position. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70747.msg583372#msg583372">Quote from: Navar42 on November 12, 2012, 07:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70747.msg583351#msg583351">Quote from: JezuzWazaMushroom on November 12, 2012, 07:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I believe you&#039;re referring to the post I made saying perhaps he&#039;s not Libertarian and in fact a Nazi who&#039;s gone AWOL but then that was after I had just wired 150 BTC not knowing what was going on and there were people saying it was all over. I had been on for about five minutes when I wrote that and had no time to read all the posts made by others of significance. My main concern was the lack of authority on the issue saying something and the mods saying the same thing that they knew nothing either. When I woke up that morning I hadn&#039;t planned on losing $1600 of my good friends $ before I had a shower, know what I mean? I also must add that I said it was HIGHLY UNLIKELY he would do that to us but leaving us in the dark wasn&#039;t very considerate either, particularly for vendors, and the Admins NOT DPR should have let us all know they&#039;d fucked up since it was also on their watch and DPR had no fucking idea what was up! Seriously cunt, WTF is your problem? Were you born a woman who&#039;s on her rags every day? You are one of these people who thinks the world owes them something but DPR owes you shit, except an eviction notice IMO!

Like I said before, he&#039;s led us all to Paradise Island full of treasure and that deserves appreciation in and of itself, not to mention he&#039;s constantly making things more secure for us all.

				Gave up reading this rant half way through. but what surprised me if there is any shred of truth to it which I&#039;m skeptical about. why would you put u[ so much personal info. a car that you own that is not very common and some kind of credit card that noone has. you would just serve to extreemly narrow down who you could be if LE were to take any interest. I call BS<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70747.msg583519#msg583519">Quote from: JezuzWazaMushroom on November 12, 2012, 09:32 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s no that I can&#039;t actually afford to pay back a dirty rotten $1500 dollars, it&#039;s that it&#039;s the last thing I want to have to do with $1500. $1500 is $1500 and why would I want it going somewhere it shouldn&#039;t when it could feed a starving child or something? I actually have $2K in there TBH, and let me tell you a secret why millionaire&#039;s stay millionaire&#039;s, because they&#039;re not frivolous with it and they spend other peoples money not their own and the good ones put it all into tax deductible charities like myself. <br /><br />One year Kerry Packer (Australia&#039;s deceased former wealthiest person) paid $84 in tax. One of Australia&#039;s most well known gangster cum celebrity types Mick Gatto, operates a &quot;industrial dispute resolution&quot; business that although he drives an E63 AMG (I myself drive an S-Class but a Kompressor 3.5L with the 7sp G-Tronic box because it&#039;s not for racing it&#039;s a family car) and has holiday houses all over the place, posted an overall loss for the year of something like 27K a couple of years back to not pay tax. Look at Warren Buffet who still lives in the same house he bought a million years ago and yet still wouldn&#039;t give his kids anything more than an education of the highest standard. Buffets really nice grand daughter whom he&#039;s disowned for her part in a documentary shows how twisted some get by money and what they do with it. My point is this, smart people with money never actually spend money because after a certain point your milking your investments and putting it down to tax. Oh you&#039;re having a party, no you&#039;re not you&#039;re having a &quot;company dinner which just happens to require magicians and &quot;exotic dancers&quot; to win over a prospective investment partner&quot; but nobody there invested after seeing it wasn&#039;t viable for their portfolio due to unseen circumstances&quot; lol. <br /><br />One day I was talking with this drug dealer idiot with bling all over him and was even getting fucking gems in his tooth FFS, (retard rich kid) who was going on about how rich he was and that he never leaves the house without ten grand on his person for &quot;just in case&quot; and I said I&#039;ll bet you what you have on you right now that I&#039;m worth more than you and I only have $150 in my wallet &quot;just in case&quot; we&#039;ll do this by comparing who has the largest bank account. He said &quot;I have lots of bank accounts&quot; so I said alright how about who has the access to the most cash or credit at a casino right now accessible to us with with what cards we had on us (it felt like playing Pokemon or whatever that Manga card game cartoon is kids watch with him) so off to Crown Jupiters we went since he didn&#039;t believe me and I wouldn&#039;t show him mine till we got there. He converted his cash to chips and I went and organised the same in value to pretend like I didn&#039;t know something he didn&#039;t, and went back over to where our friends were hanging out chatting about it as they had all become very interested in our wager, I guess it was one of those who had the biggest cocks in the room type things, then publicly with everyone we went to the floor manager and pulled out our cocks and he had an AMEX Platinum which he thought was the bomb, until I pulled out something very few people have, like a big cock, my AMEX Centurion Card. The Centurion Card is something you have to be invited to get by meeting certain wealth and spending criteria and just to have it costs me money every year for the security of being anywhere in the world and being able to buy a house if I want let alone just get a shit load of gold if the world looks like it&#039;s going to get fucked and go into hiding. Needless to say he was fucking ropable about it and I took his chips anyway and sent the money to an organisation I know he hates in his name too and showed him the receipt scan through Facebook, an organisation that supports the Palestinian people (because he&#039;s a Jew boy) but Fatah not HAMAS. <br /><br />So I think you can deduce for yourself it was a figure of speech dude. I&#039;d sooner rather give it to a kid with cancer&#039;s family who are eating baked beans every night for dinner to pay for his care than a millionaire criminal who stole it for no reason, which isn&#039;t too far from the truth so make of that what you will, the cancer bit I mean. My mate&#039;s bills are so bad that he&#039;s ordering MDMA to flog off to pay for it. I&#039;ve offered to give him money but the cunt is too proud to accept charity, it&#039;s hard to watch. Mind you their not eating baked beans every night, but they haven&#039;t been able to go out to dinner in over a year (except my restaurant when I made them saying it was an invitation with other people to socialize, again because of his pride he says it&#039;s not my place to feed) from expenses and with his tax return he hopes to turn it into something decent because of the over inflated price of chems here. I&#039;m not going to act like I earned my wealth, it&#039;s generational but I can&#039;t help what I was born into, but unlike much of the %1 my heart lies with the Ron Paul rEVOLution, everyone and everything, and I have traveled a lot so therefore have a social conscience plus using psychedelics and going to Burning Man forces me to feel sick when I know the way &quot;they&quot; operate everything. <br /><br />However unlike in America, in Australia there&#039;s a balance of power between us and the Jews, we won&#039;t let them control our Fed etc thanks to people who go to schools similar to where I attended (St. Josephs) but I&#039;ve never seen any of David Icke&#039;s lizard people, and if I you knew some of the owners of business and politicians I know you would be surprised that they aren&#039;t in fact some form of reptilian creatures because they&#039;re cold blooded no doubt. The problem with our system though, is the Jews control our media and therefore keep the people locked in this mentality of a Left/Right paradigm mentality of thinking. <br /><br />I can tell you %100 from organisations the oldies were and still are members of and therefore dragged me into having involvement with at functions etc that I hate, that the mega rich are all in bed with each other and are about global control for themselves and their, the great grandfather started a mining company and we employ thousands of people now and made the bulk of our money from the smart old cunts prospecting skills and organising capacity to get the shit out of the ground and off to the rest of the world, and instead of paying transport companies to ship it went and started them too and shit just grew and grew. So that&#039;s why I said I&#039;m a fair but wealthier than even DPR I&#039;d say but no where near as intelligent or plain brilliant. I have nothing to do with any of &quot;them&quot; and I would do anything I can to establish Libertarianism world wide. <br /><br />So you don&#039;t think we&#039;re bankers or something our family built it&#039;s wealth out of hard work and caring for employees above all and I stretch that further to say that I will be doing everything I can to support people like the Libertarians world wide and those less fortunate. <br /><br />Here&#039;s two reasons exactly why the War On Drugs is bullshit, three actually, my mate is struggling for medical care because there&#039;s not enough state money that could easily pay for these things with war on drug expense/taxes, he&#039;s risking his life to save the life of his child and possibly his relationship, and if it&#039;s intercepted he won&#039;t be there to possibly see his child&#039;s small amount of time left. And if that were to occur the cops would paste in on their Facebook page and the Newspaper as a victory while at the same time demonizing an innocent man trying to help his family. Then we have to put up with queer cunts like that iHateNiggers CUNT who goes on about how hard it is for him because he&#039;s been locked out from Silk Road as if it&#039;s his right to use it at all when it was a gift to the world from DPR. FUCK I need to go and have a cone, but I hope this clarifies my position. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70747.msg583372#msg583372">Quote from: Navar42 on November 12, 2012, 07:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70747.msg583351#msg583351">Quote from: JezuzWazaMushroom on November 12, 2012, 07:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I believe you&#039;re referring to the post I made saying perhaps he&#039;s not Libertarian and in fact a Nazi who&#039;s gone AWOL but then that was after I had just wired 150 BTC not knowing what was going on and there were people saying it was all over. I had been on for about five minutes when I wrote that and had no time to read all the posts made by others of significance. My main concern was the lack of authority on the issue saying something and the mods saying the same thing that they knew nothing either. When I woke up that morning I hadn&#039;t planned on losing $1600 of my good friends $ before I had a shower, know what I mean? I also must add that I said it was HIGHLY UNLIKELY he would do that to us but leaving us in the dark wasn&#039;t very considerate either, particularly for vendors, and the Admins NOT DPR should have let us all know they&#039;d fucked up since it was also on their watch and DPR had no fucking idea what was up! Seriously cunt, WTF is your problem? Were you born a woman who&#039;s on her rags every day? You are one of these people who thinks the world owes them something but DPR owes you shit, except an eviction notice IMO! Just like the terrorists have really won by making the world a scared place to live and given LEO more power over peoples lives, so to does acting the way you do on here make people not confident in our ships captain, who deserves our appreciation and respect for bringing us all together knowing full well he&#039;s putting his fucking LIFE on the line for us to have a free market so that we can have a pot of gold to draw from. Like I said before, he&#039;s led us all to Paradise Island full of treasure and that deserves appreciation in and of itself, not to mention he&#039;s constantly making things more secure for us all. Personally, I&#039;d follow him to the ends of the Earth and go to war for him or any other Libertarian against The System, except you since traitors deserve only one thing in times of war, and this is a motherfucking war!

				Do people really want the admin to stop working on fixing SR to come on here every hour for an update?<br /><br />Be patient, this is not fucking walmart or amazon. You can&#039;t expect fast service and bending over for your every need because just in case you never noticed SR is an illegal site. So you have to expect things might go wrong, otherwise you are in the wrong place doing the wrong things.<br /><br />So yeah, just chill the fuck out.

He converted his cash to chips and I went and organised the same in value to pretend like I didn&#039;t know something he didn&#039;t, and went back over to where our friends were hanging out chatting about it as they had all become very interested in our wager, I guess it was one of those who had the biggest cocks in the room type things, then publicly with everyone we went to the floor manager and pulled out our cocks and he had an AMEX Platinum which he thought was the bomb, until I pulled out something very few people have, like a big cock, my AMEX Centurion Card. The Centurion Card is something you have to be invited to get by meeting certain wealth and spending criteria and just to have it costs me money every year for the security of being anywhere in the world and being able to buy a house if I want let alone just get a shit load of gold if the world looks like it&#039;s going to get fucked and go into hiding. Needless to say he was fucking ropable about it and I took his chips anyway and sent the money to an organisation I know he hates in his name too and showed him the receipt scan through Facebook, an organisation that supports the Palestinian people (because he&#039;s a Jew boy) but Fatah not HAMAS. <br /><br />So I think you can deduce for yourself it was a figure of speech dude. I&#039;d sooner rather give it to a kid with cancer&#039;s family who are eating baked beans every night for dinner to pay for his care than a millionaire criminal who stole it for no reason, which isn&#039;t too far from the truth so make of that what you will, the cancer bit I mean. My mate&#039;s bills are so bad that he&#039;s ordering MDMA to flog off to pay for it. I&#039;ve offered to give him money but the cunt is too proud to accept charity, it&#039;s hard to watch. Mind you their not eating baked beans every night, but they haven&#039;t been able to go out to dinner in over a year (except my restaurant when I made them saying it was an invitation with other people to socialize, again because of his pride he says it&#039;s not my place to feed) from expenses and with his tax return he hopes to turn it into something decent because of the over inflated price of chems here. I&#039;m not going to act like I earned my wealth, it&#039;s generational but I can&#039;t help what I was born into, but unlike much of the %1 my heart lies with the Ron Paul rEVOLution, everyone and everything, and I have traveled a lot so therefore have a social conscience plus using psychedelics and going to Burning Man forces me to feel sick when I know the way &quot;they&quot; operate everything. <br /><br />However unlike in America, in Australia there&#039;s a balance of power between us and the Jews, we won&#039;t let them control our Fed etc thanks to people who go to schools similar to where I attended (St. Josephs) but I&#039;ve never seen any of David Icke&#039;s lizard people, and if I you knew some of the owners of business and politicians I know you would be surprised that they aren&#039;t in fact some form of reptilian creatures because they&#039;re cold blooded no doubt. The problem with our system though, is the Jews control our media and therefore keep the people locked in this mentality of a Left/Right paradigm mentality of thinking. <br /><br />I can tell you %100 from organisations the oldies were and still are members of and therefore dragged me into having involvement with at functions etc that I hate, that the mega rich are all in bed with each other and are about global control for themselves and their, the great grandfather started a mining company and we employ thousands of people now and made the bulk of our money from the smart old cunts prospecting skills and organising capacity to get the shit out of the ground and off to the rest of the world, and instead of paying transport companies to ship it went and started them too and shit just grew and grew. So that&#039;s why I said I&#039;m a fair but wealthier than even DPR I&#039;d say but no where near as intelligent or plain brilliant. I have nothing to do with any of &quot;them&quot; and I would do anything I can to establish Libertarianism world wide. <br /><br />So you don&#039;t think we&#039;re bankers or something our family built it&#039;s wealth out of hard work and caring for employees above all and I stretch that further to say that I will be doing everything I can to support people like the Libertarians world wide and those less fortunate. <br /><br />Here&#039;s two reasons exactly why the War On Drugs is bullshit, three actually, my mate is struggling for medical care because there&#039;s not enough state money that could easily pay for these things with war on drug expense/taxes, he&#039;s risking his life to save the life of his child and possibly his relationship, and if it&#039;s intercepted he won&#039;t be there to possibly see his child&#039;s small amount of time left. And if that were to occur the cops would paste in on their Facebook page and the Newspaper as a victory while at the same time demonizing an innocent man trying to help his family. Then we have to put up with queer cunts like that iHateNiggers CUNT who goes on about how hard it is for him because he&#039;s been locked out from Silk Road as if it&#039;s his right to use it at all when it was a gift to the world from DPR.

I actually have $2K in there TBH, and let me tell you a secret why millionaire&#039;s stay millionaire&#039;s, because they&#039;re not frivolous with it and they spend other peoples money not their own and the good ones put it all into tax deductible charities like myself. <br /><br />One year Kerry Packer (Australia&#039;s deceased former wealthiest person) paid $84 in tax. One of Australia&#039;s most well known gangster cum celebrity types Mick Gatto, operates a &quot;industrial dispute resolution&quot; business that although he drives an E63 AMG (I myself drive an S-Class but a Kompressor 3.5L with the 7sp G-Tronic box because it&#039;s not for racing it&#039;s a family car) and has holiday houses all over the place, posted an overall loss for the year of something like 27K a couple of years back to not pay tax. Look at Warren Buffet who still lives in the same house he bought a million years ago and yet still wouldn&#039;t give his kids anything more than an education of the highest standard. Buffets really nice grand daughter whom he&#039;s disowned for her part in a documentary shows how twisted some get by money and what they do with it. My point is this, smart people with money never actually spend money because after a certain point your milking your investments and putting it down to tax. Oh you&#039;re having a party, no you&#039;re not you&#039;re having a &quot;company dinner which just happens to require magicians and &quot;exotic dancers&quot; to win over a prospective investment partner&quot; but nobody there invested after seeing it wasn&#039;t viable for their portfolio due to unseen circumstances&quot; lol. <br /><br />One day I was talking with this drug dealer idiot with bling all over him and was even getting fucking gems in his tooth FFS, (retard rich kid) who was going on about how rich he was and that he never leaves the house without ten grand on his person for &quot;just in case&quot; and I said I&#039;ll bet you what you have on you right now that I&#039;m worth more than you and I only have $150 in my wallet &quot;just in case&quot; we&#039;ll do this by comparing who has the largest bank account.

				So to summarize:<br /><br />A. DPR Posts &quot;GPG Signed&quot; Message on DPR account updating us on when the road will be back.<br />B. GPG Signature does not match DPR public key that seems to be floating around on the forums.<br /><br />...and as a result....<br /><br />C. Vendors and users are largely back to where they were on Friday, suspicions are certainly warranted.<br /><br />Seem about right?

If you stick to encrypting your adres and other sensitive data with PGP, FBI or any other DEA etc. would see trying to decrypt users data meaningless, and if they would be dumb enough to start doing it, probably they would try first with big buyers/vendors, and the start point would be vendors.<br />2. Other option, as you mentioned on other thread, if they would make arrest with highly rated vendors, they would have to change they PGP keys, and in minutes vendor would write on forum that his account is compromised.<br /><br />So yes, we can assume that there is some risk, but this risk was there even before maintenance.

Id take a decent&nbsp; time for them to find DPR (if he is really as smart as we all hope and think he is) not to mention this very generously kind sir that makes all this possible would be a FOOL if he is located in the states. the fact of the matter at hand is that theres no way this site could be shut down from only the DEA the FBI etc... this is a WORLDWIDE market with WORLDWIDE buyers and vendors. id take some crazy all leaders from around the world to sit down at the big round table to discuss how they would have to work TOGETHER as one to bring it down shit.&nbsp; And Im not even going to get into the farmers market example as we all know that site was a joke, but hey, could it have been what lead to the silk road? the world may never know:) lets all also not forget though that on sat a moderator from the road posted an update about the site, and i remember him saying &quot;we would be amazed if we didnt have it back up and running by Monday (its now Monday night and still not up) but then the post fro DPR from yesterday doesn&#039;t address any of the latest previous update from the moderator, any specifics and the stories on each post seemed to vary. I don&#039;t know what to believe anymore so i welcome anyone to make some of this more clear. Maybe DPR made his millions then cashed out not to become another fatality sitting in a penitentiary only to tell his or hers stories. he actually made his $, got out Scott free, kept his freedom, kept his stories to tell, and of course kept his fortune. &lt;------ thats an option not always thought of ;)<br /><br />(THIS IS ALL OPNION BASED NO NEGATIVE KARMA PLESAEEEE :D ID LOVE TO HEAR OTHERS THOUGHTS)<br />

I wouldn&#039;t read too much into the email address associated with the gpg key, because anyone can put anything in that field. It would be one of the easiest ways to get information about DPR if he was that stupid to put info that could be associated with him.<br />My guess would be some spammer/scammer has registered that domain afterwards once seeing his key. I would have probably put obvious garbage in there like you said or at least the onion address of the site. Probably an oversight on his behalf.<br /><br />The problem we have here is there is no simple way of verifying whether DPRs posted key was valid without SR being online. Luckily like I posted you can check against older copies of messages that were posted here. The difficulty is that you likely don&#039;t have copies of those offline and the only copies easily found are on this forum which is also controlled by DPR. I just happened to have 2 messages saved entirely offline from here that I can validate against and as best as you can trust a 2 post screamer they check out.<br /><br />The true conspiracy theorists would suggest that I&#039;m also DPR. The easiest way to deal with this once this shit all blows over is to make sure DPRs public key is public and stored in places that DPR likely doesn&#039;t have control over. Then anyone can verify any of his posts any time they want without relying on people reposting his pubkey here.

The main issue with BMR is lack of selection when compared to SR.

Are the obliged to conform to the laws of data protection and freedom of information (if applicable)...<br /><br />I have a good idea, if SR decides its game over lets go to our local financial regulators and complain to them to help us retrieve the funds that are currently held is escrow because we wanted to buy illegal drugs over the internet.<br /><br />Dank

Keep up the great work, and definitely take your time if it makes the site faster and safer than ever before.

				Jesus fucking Christ. This downtime is pissing me off. Not because the site is down, but because people are going fucking apeshit. I actually HOPE that those of you saying you&#039;re done with SR mean it. I hope there is a mass exodus of you fuckers. I hope you go to the next Farmer&#039;s Market and use Paypal to buy fake acid from some vendor who has no fucking clue how to package things properly. I hope the police bust down your door and get your ungrateful asses out of the drug market, because you are pissing me off at an unholy level. If you don&#039;t like how the captain is running his ship, jump the fuck off. Don&#039;t scream when the sharks eat you alive even as you drown. If I met you at a party while rolling on MDMA, I would still be angry enough to punch you in the face. Goddamn.<br />

				I just placed an order with Modziw (my absolute favorite vendor on SR) on BMR and it went absolutely flawlessly so far. I verified thru email that this account is his account, and he has been fantastic with email communication tonight.<br /><br />If you really need roxies, I highly recommend taking the plunge into BMR (I know it hurts...it hurt me too) if you can&#039;t stand to wait any longer.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t hurt to look...right?<br /><br />- TC :)

You continue to improve paradise because you are an awesome person, and we owe you a lot of respect. Thanks for the continued updates.

				i just wish SR would come up just so i don&#039;t have to come to these forums - its just a bunch of frustrated people and DPR worshippers bashing them<br /><br />haven&#039;t conversed with him personally but DPR comes across as a genuine people&#039;s champion, is humble, understands the frustrations of the people and accepts his responsibility towards his users. if my perception is correct there, i would imagine him being very disappointed with the worshippers - he&#039;s making an effort to bring people freedoms, the worshippers are busy trying to suppress other people&#039;s opinions... think about it :/

				^Yes. Most of us are lurkers and don&#039;t have a strong forum presence. We know this sort of thing has happened before and will happen again. <br /><br />Some peoples livelihoods are committed to SR and that&#039;s understandable, but on the other hand there is no reason to be upset. If you did your homework, you already knew of the risks you were taking and prepared for them when You made your account.

I was serious when I said I&#039;d let you fuck my sister too BTW (not that I&#039;m like Lot offering up his daughters to the Sodomites but you get the point).<br /><br />You show the world what free markets and libertarianism can truly achieve and whoever thinks otherwise is an intellectual midget of biblical proportions!<br /><br />HACKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE... HACK THE PLANET &amp; LONG LIVE DPR &amp; THE SILK ROAD rEVOLution!!!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70747.msg585566#msg585566">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on November 13, 2012, 04:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hey gang,<br /><br />We&#039;re still getting things set up.&nbsp; Nothing new to report.&nbsp; Obviously I can&#039;t say much, but we are redeploying the entire system and it is taking lots of time to get all of the data properly backed up and where it needs to be, not to mention thoroughly testing the changes we are making to the system that will hopefully give us enough head room to grow multiple times again.<br /><br />I&#039;m fully aware that Silk Road isn&#039;t your only choice and that my reputation is on the line right now.&nbsp; We are working on all of these issues in parallel and will be slamming the caffeine until we are up and stable.<br /><br />Your next update will come no later than 5 am EST.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />DPR<br /><br />PS - I hear everyone&#039;s hopes and fears.&nbsp; This is a stressful time for some of us.&nbsp; I&#039;m taking this opportunity to find a calm center as the situation whirls around me and I keep pressing forward, calm and clear.&nbsp; This won&#039;t be the most challenging situation I&#039;ll face I am sure and it is good practice.&nbsp; Good luck to each of you as you get through this with me :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				This is officially my first post on SR forum... My theory on this whole outage mess is as follows: all the impatient hate mongers on here who mistrust the DPR are the people who are hard pressed on obtaining the opiates and amphetamines. The ones who are patiently waiting and holding up faith in peace are the herbalists. The ones with completely unrelated posts like shit about Ke$ha and porn are the habitual LSD and DMT using psychonauts. <br /><br />Just trying to find some order in the chaos of this situation. Whether SR lives or dies, I always dreamed of it&#039;s existence before i even came across it. Good times&nbsp; 8)

				k, i&#039;m bored now but if you guys want to play with conspiracy theories, i&#039;ll throw one into the mix; the hacker blackmail was legit, SR guys tried a while to get to him but ended up having to pay him off to save the business. now they&#039;re either trying to figure out how he did it or have already done so and are rewriting large sections of the code to make sure it can&#039;t happen again. no organization would rightfully admit something like that happened to them.<br /><br />whatever the case, i think i gotta go find my local again for some herbs till this is resolved one way or another :/

				I don&#039;t know, I hope we&#039;re not really the minority here. I think that most people are just sitting back and laughing their ass off at this thread, content with the knowledge that the site will be back soon. Obviously the trolls and whiners are going to make the most noise. I&#039;m just trying to have fun with it while I can. It&#039;s like when that Tony scam happened. I mean it really sucked, and even I lost $250 (I learned a valuable lesson about finalizing early that day... luckily a fairly cheap lesson), but watching the Rumor Mill slowly unravel into an incoherent, rambling mess almost made it all worth it. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if somewhere, DPR has a &quot;fuck shit up&quot; button, just so he can laugh his ass off too. &quot;Let&#039;s see, I&#039;ll turn this #1 vendor into a scammer. Ah yes, that was a good one. Hmm now I&#039;ll shut the site down for a week and see what happens. Haha, of course, they turn into animals. How amusing.&quot;

				Uh it is not a valid opinion to say that we should all be scared because DPR didn&#039;t sign a single post. If you have been around for any of the other major scares in the past, you&#039;ll know that this gets brought up every fucking time, and it&#039;s never led to anything. It&#039;s cool if you want to get all paranoid and on the edge of your seat because of server downtime. But don&#039;t patronize us and act like you&#039;re the grown-ups here.

It&#039;s cool if you want to get all paranoid and on the edge of your seat because of server downtime. But don&#039;t patronize us and act like you&#039;re the grown-ups here.

And when i say who really knows, i&#039;m speaking of fact-based knowledge. Fact is that the crew guy inigo is shocked at this point that the site isn&#039;t back up... So for him to be shocked again that it doesn&#039;t go up tomorrow wouldn&#039;t be particularly shocking. All these users setting the expectations very low may have the effect of being more even more pleasantly surprised when the site does come back up anyway. Kind of like getting that Christmas present that you wanted the most but your parents made you think they&#039;d never get for you

				Thanks for the updates DPR, luckily I have been on vacation, and only have a few Bitcoins in my account (maybe almost none, probably unless there is a refund or resolution waiting for me).<br /><br />Hopefully we get a new update by 530am EST. (I assume that was the time, cant recall the last update but think it was that time). <br /><br />Just need my mary jane, and Ill be happy, I dont know how to contact mroiud outside of SR, and I heard is account got taken down recently, so hopefully the admin got my message asking why he was banned...hopefully I can find a new trusted vendor asap, down to my last 14g, and that wont last long.<br /><br />(PS; im not a newb, ill update my profile, i just cant remember for hells sake my password to my real username)

				Nice one DPR. Another update. Just after I get out of bed. I can go about my day now. And there will be another update when I get home. I have to agree with some posters. Its hard to believe how childish some people are being on the forum. That being said there&#039;s always gonna be trolls.

				I agree that advance notice would be helpful and very much appreciated, but there&#039;s no telling if this, or any other downtime is a planned one. Just because things are being upgraded and debugged etc doesn&#039;t mean that they were planned to be at this very moment. Though I agree that communication has been less than optimal especially for the first while, I don&#039;t believe we can go and rant about our rights. Even though we&#039;re paying for this service, it&#039;s illegal everywhere, we have no rights in this matter. People need to realise that they take a risk when they put their money into SR, not just because of scammers but simply because SR doesn&#039;t have the backing major companies do so stuff like this happens. The staff are just people like you and me working very hard but it&#039;s not exactly like they can call the helpdesk. So let&#039;s all just chill and see where things go. DPR isn&#039;t unreasonable, he refunded me money I lost due to auto-withdrawal function during the last downtime and that was more than a bit of money. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll find a solution to any and all problems that arise due to this downtime. If we weren&#039;t resilient we wouldn&#039;t be here to begin with.

				Dear cunts in this thread...STFU &amp; GTFO.<br />Go lie and bullshit in off topic or better yet go outside and take a day off.<br /><br /><br /><br />No vendor or member of SR has ever been told in advance when the server will be going down and don&#039;t expect that to change because of a conjured feeling of entitlement. It&#039;s actually safer the way it&#039;s being done as of now though some prefer the notice all it has ever meant was that the server was being upgraded. So I&#039;ll take an educated guess that all the disconnects have left the SR team to upgrade and expand or lose vendors, members and currency from unsatisfied business maintenance and upkeep. <br /><br /><br />x)<br />nomad

				Hello DPR and SR staff,<br />I appreciate the work you have done in establishing this site and the continued work to get it back up. My question is in regards to the auto-withdrawal function established if SR goes down. At what point does this auto-withdrawal trigger? I have checked my wallet and funds have not been dispersed to it and SR is down. Will this auto-withdrawal happen and if so, when? Thanks!

				Thanks for the update.. these winging people and people gettin aggressive and agitated need to calm the fuck down. FFS what do you think this is.. a lot is at risk so stop throwin your toys out your prams. Everyone understands there have been problems so in regards to finalizes and coins and stuff like that everyone will have to do whats needed when they can.. some peoples attitudes fuckin stink.. you wanna play big boy games then act like big boys not children. I myself have a lot of coins stuck on the site and packages to send and even orders I have made myself but I&#039;m dealing with it and sitting back and relaxing till its all sorted. Some people have some serious business / social skills to learn hear. Peace.

				hi all, <br /><br />i think there seems to be an element of hysteria here - most people don&#039;t seem to rememebr what life was like before SR, TBH we have coins stuck in escrow, orders waiting and coins in wallets too - but is it worth losing any sleep over..?! of course its not!!!<br /><br />is so much more important that the site is back SAFE and RUNNING WELL AND SECURELY rather than being vulnerable to future problems, i for one salute DPR and the team for all the work they have done and fair trade their pioneering system has facilitated...<br /><br />As for all the people considering the whole thing is a scam and blah blah blah... look how many transactions are taking place each day, and DPR are taking a healthy commision from each of these - realistically the site is worth so much more running than tearing it down and ripping off peoples wallets..?!?! Also hypothetically if they did that , they would be left with thousands of units of digital currency, the value of which would plummet if SR was down permanently - its a no-brainer..!!!<br /><br /><br />let these guys do what they do, and take their sweet time doing it - the longer they take the better job we can assume they are doing&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />peace and discordia xxxxx

				It is so reasuring to read DPR&#039;s words. I keep getting waves of panic when I think about the possibility of SR never returning, I need it for so many reasons. I know it is the same for everyone, loosing this would be really awful.. This has made me realize how important this site is and that I was totally taking it for granted. Thought of it like Ebay and not the risks that are being taken by the staff. Im trying not to get caught up in the drama but when the panic grips me I need to read and talk.<br /><br />This is my concern, Im sure they are more than aware of this and doing whatever can be done to combat it but if the site came up now suddenly every one will go to it at the same time, then every vendor and buyer will message the support staff to ask them to sort out every single order that was made the couple of days before it went down. The back log will be massive and the amount will grow the longer it is down. I hope they can cope with it.<br /><br />I agree with the comments made by uniwiz above and many others just chill out a bit and wait to see what happens, Im just here for the reasurance. See it as a holiday from working on SR and try to get all the things you never have time to do, research shit.

				Katnip999, nice post that echoes my thoughts about the current situation. I&#039;ve only traveled the SR for a couple of months but it IS easy to forget what it was like in the &quot;old days&quot;. I refer to the past several years with the feds shutting down US based OPs (online pharms), forcing their customers to turn elsewhere which typically involved paying in advance and hoping your goods were eventually shipped and made it through Customs. Reading some of these posts, I&#039;m really thankful any transactions are online and not in person. Reminds me of a favorite quote: “Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference” - Mark Twain

				Tired of Bullshit i hear ya about possible sabutage...but there is nothing to be gained by being angry, i know i am in a similar place. I will be making a trek-hitchhiking the interstate-350 miles one way- as a female to go to the only doc i could find that will prescribe Suboxone w/o private insurance on short notice. Only a few docs here have the special license and i called about 20 yesterday , they either want BIG$$$ like $1100, or more commonly, they have a waiting list for at least 3 mos to over a year, due to limits on how many ppl they can have on at a time. And then ppl wonder why heroin usage goes up, when they change the oxycontin formulation, and restrict prescription pain medicines. I am in pain, and now sick too, have so much to do and i can&#039;t...i feel for anyone in this position. If only doctors were really doctors here in BFE, and compassionate...a bunch of moralfags sucking DEA dick. I am just putting this idea out there, i&#039;ll proly get more negative karma for doing anything other than cheerio msg. Anyone ever think the pushback against prescribing narcotics could be BigPharma influenced? Because all the narcotics (hydro and oxycodone) are generic now, and they make their big money off proprietary like SUBOXONE! And of course, they&#039;re losing the war against weed...so a new bogey man arises. I&#039;m sure there are lots of variables to plug in, but they have to keep the LE prison-industrial complex going - for that&#039;s a HUGE lobby/influence group.. And keeps heroin from Afghanistan mkts up for their little war profiteering there as well. Don&#039;t just come back with a bunch of hate, i&#039;m tryna think beyond the face of things. And that could be useful in SR being down so long as well. If it&#039;s true it&#039;s because of LE, nothing we can do anyway there either? Just wondering what ppl think can be done? This withdrawal crap on top of pain might have me on edge so ... and so what can we do to make the sitch better?

It should be virtually impossible if he takes the right precautions, which I am convinced he does. And if they did, why would they want to keep the site running? The day we go in to SR and see a big FBI logo, then we can start worrying. &quot;SEIZED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT&quot; - lol, that will never happen.<br /><br />Come on stop speculating people...

				Is it a wise decision for LE to take Silk Road down?

But young people aren&#039;t hanging round the streets waiting to meet violent dealers who could expose them to even more dangerous drugs such as Meth and Crack. I&#039;m aware you can buy these on the Road too but people also have access to a wealth of safety information about these drugs with a few clicks of the mouse, not unreliable misinformation from peers and pressure to indulge which happens on the streets. Most documentaries and websites would put people right off Meth and Crack.

The advantage would also be that it is extremely safe in comparison to many other substances (meth, heroin, crack etc) so the site would likely not be targeted in such a ruthless manner by LE. It could list items by strain for example and have a wiki with strain information. Anyway it&#039;s just a thought as i, like many others, are slightly concerned about the longevity of Silk Road.

Vendors (and I&#039;m one of them, yes I use a fake account obviously) pay a crapload of fees and commission to use this service. some have thousands of btc stored on sr and not a single explanation is given. Yeah, unless you consider the lame &#039;too many new users&#039; bullshit as an excuse. No site goes down for ten days {EDIT:}on and off{/} because it can&#039;t handle some new users. + it&#039;s not like it was totally obvious silk road was getting bigger. DPR should have used the funds to prepare for shit like this waaay in advance.<br /><br />Then the LE problem. Yes, we can all just wait and tell each other to chill the fuck out but TiredOfThisBullshit has a valid point. SR is simply the biggest drug trading site on the internet and police would do anything to bust its vendors. It would definitely be possible to get at least a lot closer to them. For example, they could stop the btc tumbler in a non-obvious way, trace the bitcoins until they reach an exchange like mt gox and demand the gox user&#039;s personal info. They can because mt gox is weak as shit when it comes to handing over private information (and so are most other major exchanges).<br /><br />I am not saying this is the case, just that you shouldn&#039;t just ignore the possibilities. Of all people I expected SR users to at least be a little paranoid. We might forget it because we use this site like ebay but SR is serious shit. We shit on LE&#039;s reputation and laugh while doing it. We ship insane amounts of drugs all over the world while customs are just totally oblivious of all the goods that pass them.<br /><br />To quote a US senator (from the sr wikipedia page):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s a certifiable one-stop shop for illegal drugs that represents the most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online that we have ever seen. It&#039;s more brazen than anything else by lightyears.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s us. Don&#039;t forget it.<br /><br />EDIT: To DPR: Don&#039;t be an asshole and at 23:00 give us a GOOD explanation.<br /><br />If a drug buyer doesn&#039;t receive the goods he has paid for he deserves an explanation. If we, the vendors, don&#039;t get access to our &#039;product&#039; deserve one too because we are YOUR clients. Right now you only come up with bullshit reports about how hard you&#039;re working. We don&#039;t give a hit. We want to know WHAT you&#039;re actually working on. Because some serious shit needs to be going down for a site not to function for ten days straight.<br /><br />If at 11 o&#039;clock you&#039;re just posting that you&#039;re still working very hard, the site&#039;s still down and you don&#039;t know when it will be finished, i can&#039;t take you seriously.

The disadvantage is that you don&#039;t have a large team of coders and thousands of beta testers.

				I would have to disagree that if LE took the site down that they&#039;d have some big announcement on Google news or something like that.&nbsp; In fact, I would expect them to milk the information from behind the scenes for as long as possible versus tipping everyone off that it has been busted.<br /><br />One thing that can&#039;t be denied is that the Bitcoin got hammered down around Oct 26/27 and that event coincided with one of the main BTC vendors on SR going down WELL BEFORE the SR outage.&nbsp; Possibly someone on the inside got tipped off that a bust was coming and then sold off their coins. <br /><br />Another reason that I believe you have not heard very much information from DPR or the site admins is that if LE is actually in control of the site, they do not want to tip people off by posting long drawn out posts which may sound or appear to be out of character or different in writing style from the real DPR.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as those that think the site is well protected and that LE would never be able to find out where the server was located, I would have to disagree with that also.&nbsp; Even though the IP may be hidden, I am fairly confident that you could flood the site with traffic at non peak times and then monitor the corresponding traffic through the major networks to see where the packets went.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope I am wrong.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m sure this has been covered, but has anyone confirmed that the recent messages were in fact signed by dpr? I haven&#039;t been reading every single post like some of you are, but last i heard there was some issue with his sig on at least one post since Sr went down.&nbsp; What&#039;s the status of that?

I do not believe this is the case. The events that have transpired are not indicative of LE infiltration. Other then the possibility massive hardware failure the only remaining issue is hackers.&nbsp; SR was compromised by hackers most likely after the stored BTC. With out any major blockchain moves they where probably unable to breach SR financial systrm. I am sire they did some damage to the site or stole information as barganing chips. DPR is probably trying to close the security breach and or negotiating with whoever compromised the site.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The problem is that no matter the reason we DESERVE the know what the fuck is going on. Hackers, OK, but tell us. LE, ok, tell us, fucked up hardware, how hard is it to just fucking tell.<br /><br />Like I said earlier: we (vendors) are the clients here and DPR is failing miserably to deliver the product we have paid for (the site) or to at least keep up up to date on its status.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, they are being very vague and the story isn&#039;t adding up.<br /><br />DPR said that it was a surprise in the first post, but on the website it says scheduled maintenance.<br /><br />There are a few things that I believe could be happening right now:<br />1) SR was unexpectedly downed and DPR lied about the maintenance being scheduled for some reason.<br />2) SR is changing or expanding hosts and DPR doesn&#039;t want us to know for anonymity and security reasons.<br />3) SR was taken over by feds and they are in the process of modifying SR to addresses are logged to them.

I would guess that it takes an average of two weeks for a bitcoin to come into SR in a buyers hands and leave in a sellers hand.<br /><br />If $1m in drug sales are made in the two weeks, then he would get $1m, but he could wait and keep it running and get only $100k of that.<br /><br />Basically, DPR has the choice between $1m and no continuous income or $200k/mo<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As long as we&#039;re throwing around theories...This doesn&#039;t take into account the amount of stuck coin in every buyer/vendor account in the system when the site went down. That figure might be a litte higher than $1m. Who knows how many users keep that as their main wallet because of the added security it offers.

Around October 26/27 the price of Bitcoin dropped due to to heavy selling volume.&nbsp; Also around this same time, one of the biggest bitcoin vendors on SR went offline and stated that he was down due to &#039;SR problems and network difficulties&#039;.&nbsp; This vendor continued with this message the week of 11/5 up until the SR outage.<br />2.). There has been very little communication from the site admins.&nbsp; I am guessing that there was some type of dead man switch on the site which trashed the server in the event that the admin had been captured.&nbsp; LE is probably scrambling to rebuild the site right now and put that bogus maintenance screen up to calm everyones fears.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Nahh, if that was the case, I&#039;m sure someone in the team or someone somehow associated with SR would have a way of coming on here and letting people know its been compromised. No way in the world that LE could recreate SR in a couple of days, if there was a kill switch i&#039;m sure it would of deleted everything, right? Which means all accounts and histories etc. <br /><br />I also think people overestimate the amount of LE resourced being used here. Exactly how would LE &quot;capture DPR&quot;? It should be virtually impossible if he takes the right precautions, which I am convinced he does. And if they did, why would they want to keep the site running?

LE, ok, tell us, fucked up hardware, how hard is it to just fucking tell.<br /><br />Like I said earlier: we (vendors) are the clients here and DPR is failing miserably to deliver the product we have paid for (the site) or to at least keep up up to date on its status.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, they are being very vague and the story isn&#039;t adding up.<br /><br />DPR said that it was a surprise in the first post, but on the website it says scheduled maintenance.<br /><br />There are a few things that I believe could be happening right now:<br />1) SR was unexpectedly downed and DPR lied about the maintenance being scheduled for some reason.<br />2) SR is changing or expanding hosts and DPR doesn&#039;t want us to know for anonymity and security reasons.<br />3) SR was taken over by feds and they are in the process of modifying SR to addresses are logged to them.

The same random key system that launders your btc to keep your transactions anonymous is just how he&#039;s cashing out every account to hide the huge transactions in the blockchain. The emergency backup wallet address system leads to his gox accounts.If he started cashing out 5 or 6 days ago, that money is long gone and certainly would explain the 40 cent dip over the weekend. With more to come immediately once the rest of the rubes on here realize it&#039;s never coming back. Maybe he is pirateat40.

				Post by: <strong>QualityMeds</strong> on <strong>November 13, 2012, 10:06 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				First, for all my customers (I&#039;m a vendor on SR by the same name, QualityMeds), as soon as SR is back up, all orders will be shipped promptly. I don&#039;t see it taking more than one or two days to get all the pending orders shipped. Also, I still offer free samples of everything I sell, read my profile/signature at the end of my post here for my items. Message me with your name/shipping address and what samples you want to try out.<br /><br />About this situation: I think it&#039;s so funny how people overreact to these down times. I&#039;ve been a vendor on other sites and forums for many years. I would go away for a few days on business and would return to people posting every conspiracy theory in the book, from LE busting me to me running away with all their money. People cry scammer so easily. I don&#039;t blame them though, nearly everyone who cries scammer is someone who has been scammed in the past. It&#039;s too bad, if it weren&#039;t for all those filthy scammers, we wouldn&#039;t have anything to worry about. They ruin it for the rest of us honest vendors.<br /><br />Yes, it is true that sometimes it is a scam and the seller/vendor will run away with your money. But one thing I&#039;ve noticed, and this holds true 95% of the time - when you&#039;ve really been scammed, all communication ceases. The fact that DPR is updating us every 5 hours is the best sign. If he wanted to run away with all of our money then he wouldn&#039;t be wasting his time updating us on the status of the site. In fact, after he emptied all the bitcoin into his own wallet, he would have probably just shut it all down and put the server offline, to cut any ties. He definitely would not be wasting his time updating us on the status, he&#039;d be on some tropical island sipping margaritas on a beach probably his own island as I&#039;m sure he has the money to afford that LOL. <br /><br />The fact is that SR makes a hell of a lot more money for DPR by being up. What is the point in scamming everyone? He sounds like a standup guy in my opinion, and besides the money he makes, what he&#039;s doing is more important than money. It is a freedom to put in your body what you choose, one step closer to defeating this insane war on drugs, which has cost more lives than it has saved and has cost the taxpayers in the United States a shit-ton of money by filling up our jails with low-level drug dealers or just users, creating ex-cons who don&#039;t have a chance to reintegrate into society when they get out of jail because of the ex-con stigma, essentially ruining their lives. 50 years from now, we&#039;ll look at this the same way we look at the freedom of speech, and wonder how crazy it was when the governments would put people in jail for smoking weed or sniffing a few lines of coke, or selling a couple ounces of pot. Thank god that Colorado and Washington have set the first precedents and have made marijuana completely legal for recreational use by those 21 or over, giving it the same status as alcohol. It&#039;s about time! <br /><br />Thanks DPR for all you are doing. I&#039;m sure you and your team are doing the best you can to bring SR back up and running. It&#039;s worth the wait to get it running faster and smoother.<br /><br />QualityMeds<br />&quot;QM&quot;<br /><br />

I&#039;m sure this news will scare some off, but should we win the fight, a new era will be born. Even if we lose, the genie is out of the bottle and they are fighting a losing War already.&quot;

				Alright, so I hope I&#039;m not being naive in my quick analysis here. Let&#039;s just think about law enforcement taking over. <br /><br />So we have three privacy mechanisms (granted, one of which some users don&#039;t always use...):<br />PGP<br />TOR<br />Bitcoin<br /><br />Using PGP, there is virtually no way for LE to get your information unless the vendor is compromised. Even so, because it is tor, they have almost no way of getting the information about the actual user, provided they are browsing carefully with no scripts enabled. <br /><br />Anyways, say they get this address. They can&#039;t do anything immediately. It is not illegal for drugs to be ordered to your address. Besides being backed by the law, this also makes sense...&nbsp; I could otherwise send drugs to a person I detest in order to get them arrested. The only way you can be arrested from this action is if upon arrival you either sign for the package OR it is found to be open (from a raid) without your calling the police. If you leave it unopened for ~8 hours afterwards, you are probably safe for the second part. Even so, this could only really happen if you didn&#039;t use PGP... If the vendor is compromised, they can&#039;t still send drugs your way just to get you arrested. I mean, LE can do some stupid shit, but that is clearly illegal.<br /><br />Well, not a thorough analysis, but I think I covered the major points.<br /><br />TL;DR Stfu you guys, we&#039;re fine.

				I&#039;m surprised no one has brought up a great reason why the 12,000 BTC (about $120,000USD) thing is bunk. It&#039;s very simple- That&#039;s a laughably small number of BTC compared to the commission made off the whole site&#039;s transactions in just one month.<br /><br />Even JUST using the USA domestic cannabis category for some simple calculations.... I estimate the top vendors move about $2000-5000 of product in a given week based on feedback frequency and checking the item descriptions for those feedback. NCK, Rook, Tweetb and many others crush $2000 a week bare minimum.. So that&#039;s an easy $10,000 a week for 5 top vendors, $40,000 in a month. There&#039;s dozens more active vendors in just Cannabis alone, I would say even $200,000 from all domestic cannabis vendors in a month is a very VERY low number. Commission is somewhere in between 6-10%, and 10% off that $200k is $20,000 in a month for commission.<br /><br />Then factor in that there&#039;s dozens of drug/other categories and vendors all over the world, custom and private listings, and people that don&#039;t leave feedback... that $20,000 from cannabis seems very small. Taking 12k BTC lump sum against a constant and cumulative commission rate like that is just financially retarded.<br /><br />edit- 120k to 12k BTC in the last line.

I estimate the top vendors move about $2000-5000 of product in a given week based on feedback frequency and checking the item descriptions for those feedback. NCK, Rook, Tweetb and many others crush $2000 a week bare minimum.. So that&#039;s an easy $10,000 a week for 5 top vendors, $40,000 in a month.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It is a freedom to put in your body what you choose, one step closer to defeating this insane war on drugs, which has cost more lives than it has saved and has cost the taxpayers in the United States a shit-ton of money by filling up our jails with low-level drug dealers or just users, creating ex-cons who don&#039;t have a chance to reintegrate into society when they get out of jail because of the ex-con stigma, essentially ruining their lives. 50 years from now, we&#039;ll look at this the same way we look at the freedom of speech, and wonder how crazy it was when the governments would put people!e in jail for smoking weed or sniffing a few lines of coke, or selling a couple ounces of pot. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Totally agree on that. Here in the Netherlands you can roll and smoke a ten inch joint at a public place in front of a police officer - me and my friends seriously done that multiple times back in the days when we where kids. Don&#039;t get me wrong I&#039;m not an advocate for kids using drugs! In the coffeshops here you definitely heard about they are really strict in not selling to kids under eighteen. But there&#039;s no way of stopping kids from getting there dope that&#039;s impossible in my opinion.. The only thing we can do about that is through prevention campaigns witch could be paid out of tax profits from drug sales if we would actually regulate drugs.. <br /><br />At a big dance party in case someone is careless and one holds xtc pills in his pocked instead of his boxer shorts and the security finds it you have to hand them in and they just let you join the party (in most cases). If you hold more than ten pills they consider you as a dealer and its possible that they make a case / process verbal of it witch could eventually result in a money penalty or at worst a work punishment. This means you have to clean the streets, washing dishes in a nursing home or guide traffic on a big event or something. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong but that &#039;work punishment&#039; is something that not exists in the States isn&#039;t it? If you are sentenced in this way (witch happened to me actually) you&#039;re not suffering much stigma here and you&#039;re still able to go to collage and acquire a proper job. We don&#039;t put people in jail and fucking there life&#039;s up for.. nothing. There are many test centers here where you can have your drugs tested so there&#039;s less contaminated drugs in circulation and if there is the institute that monitors the marked here send out warnings. If we look at the facts there are less hard drug users here, less problematic drug users and less drug related deaths..... <br /><br />Think and hope SR will be back soon.. I also lost quite a bit of money if it isn&#039;t but it isn&#039;t the end of the world if DPR or LE fucked us. Soon there will be better alternatives than the BMR don&#039;t ya think?<br /><br />

It&#039;s very simple- That&#039;s a laughably small number of BTC compared to the commission made off the whole site&#039;s transactions in just one month.<br /><br />Even JUST using the USA domestic cannabis category for some simple calculations.... I estimate the top vendors move about $2000-5000 of product in a given week based on feedback frequency and checking the item descriptions for those feedback. NCK, Rook, Tweetb and many others crush $2000 a week bare minimum.. So that&#039;s an easy $10,000 a week for 5 top vendors, $40,000 in a month. There&#039;s dozens more active vendors in just Cannabis alone, I would say even $200,000 from all domestic cannabis vendors in a month is a very VERY low number. Commission is somewhere in between 6-10%, and 10% off that $200k is $20,000 in a month for commission.<br /><br />Then factor in that there&#039;s dozens of drug/other categories and vendors all over the world, custom and private listings, and people that don&#039;t leave feedback... that $20,000 from cannabis seems very small. Taking 12k BTC lump sum against a constant and cumulative commission rate like that is just financially retarded.<br /><br />edit- 120k to 12k BTC in the last line.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />EVEN IF YOU ARE ONLY 50% CORRECT, AND THEIR INCOME FROM SR IS ONLY $10,000 per month.....THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR WEEKS OF A FUCKED UP SITE!!!!&nbsp; IF YOU HAVE CASH LIKE THAT, THIS SHIT SHOULD BE FIXED IN A DAY!!!&nbsp; AND DON&quot;T GIVE ME ANY OF THAT &quot;ITS SO COMPLICATED&quot; BULLSHIT.......SILK ROAD IS A TINY, BABY, PUSSY LITTLE WEBSITE IN INTERNET-LAND.....THESE FUCKERS ARE IDIOTS IF THEY HAVEN&quot;T GOT THE SITE UP YET.......AND........IF IT EVER DOES COME BACK UP&lt; IT BETTER BE LIGHTNING FUCKING FAST AND SUCKING OUR DICKS !&nbsp; &nbsp; I AM STILL TIRED OF THIS BULLSHIT!!!! <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Please kill yourself<br /><br /><br />

AGAIN I STRESS THIS IF I WERE DPR AND I WANTED TO<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; VANISH (YOU WOULD NOT BE READING THIS AND YOU DAMN SURE WOULDN&#039;T GET ANY UPDATES.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I know it&#039;s in our nature to wonder but I promise you it will not get the site up any faster to get yourselves all worked up<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope the site comes up soon as well but at the time all we should be doing is sitting here as a tight community and all I<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; see is a broken one. I have done my part today to give you a bit more info then you can find. Now figure something out<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to do your part as well (community) i.e START WITH THE HALT OF STUPID MESSAGES AND STORIES.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; U.G.S<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Calm down.&nbsp; &nbsp;All is well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes, a little &quot;push&quot; is required.&nbsp;

				So I think we need a more concrete time-frame as to when we can expect SR to be up and running again. It&#039;s been over 5 days and every update DPR says that there getting &quot;close&quot; to fixing the problem.&nbsp; ::)

				Hello Everyone!&nbsp; <br /><br />As a Vendor here who is hopeful all things return bigger and better, we must say we understand why certain members here are angry. <br />We believe the fearless leader DPR, whether that be a real person, or a group of people, are doing everyone a huge disservice with their<br />obviously vague &quot;updates&quot; that say nothing other than &quot;working on it&quot;......&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />As a vendor, we have not been able to effectively use SR for almost 2 weeks.....it has been down completely for more than 5 days.....<br />it has severely hampered our plans, our income, and our future prospects. <br />While we hope this issue will be resolved soon,&nbsp; &nbsp;we must implore those in control,&nbsp; please provide us with&nbsp; CONCRETE info as to WHATS wrong, <br />and WHEN SR will be up.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is really NO REASON that can&#039;t be done, and your refusal to do so is what&#039;s causing everyone to be spooked.&nbsp; <br />In the time that has passed already, a whole new SilkRoad could have been programmed and implemented!&nbsp; &nbsp; What are you doing????<br />If they truly are legit, and no shenanigans are taking place, there is no reason this site is still down.<br />While we appreciate the opportunity to even be here, this is getting over the top ridiculous by now.<br />

I consider it an important milestone in any SR users&#039; voyage to get chewed out by Lim, he doesn&#039;t just go after any asshole troll on here. I feel special now. &lt;3<br /><br />But, I&#039;m guessing that you also found it disrespectful to ask a vendor for a ballpark estimate on weekly sales, which is fine. I don&#039;t deny that it can be considered rude, but the context of my question has been left out. I made a hypothetical situation a few pages back to give people a scope on the ridiculous amount of commission SR makes to de-bunk the &#039;12k btc is gone omg dpr is stealing from us&#039; theory. I just was looking for an estimate to see if my numbers were close. Doesn&#039;t really matter either way, really; I still stand by my modest estimates in that post. NCK also replied with basically &quot;$0 this week&quot; to which I essentially said &quot;lol that&#039;s a good answer&quot; Don&#039;t worry guys, he can handle himself here!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s anyone&#039;s business to have any idea how much money someone makes, be it on SR or in real life. You can guesstimate based on prices and the product rotation how much money someone actually makes here. There&#039;s no need to ask. It was already stated earlier that for marijuana alone, monthly income is estimated around 100 or 200k or so. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you&#039;re a vendor or not, but if you are, would you feel comfortable talking about your earnings? I sure wouldn&#039;t.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, you&#039;re right, no one has the right to know how much a vendor makes. That&#039;s not what I asked, though. I politely asked if he would be comfortable giving an estimate, to see how close my estimates were. I used those exact criteria to make my estimations, which is also my post that you&#039;re referring to. People are missing the connection of the context beforehand and think I am blindly asking how much NCK profits. Which is completely fine given how much of a clusterfuck this thread is.<br /><br />I believe a fellow vendor asking that question would be more out of line, but I&#039;ve had dozens of people ask how much I make on eBay, mostly in disbelief that my entire income comes from there. Rude, yes,but I didn&#039;t have to answer. Neither did NCK.

				all these words of people griping and whining don&#039;t really matter. if this shit works for you - vendor or buyer - you keep on. all in. you can&#039;t build up some model SR in your head where everything works great, build your business model off that, and plod forward on the assumption that your imaginary SR will do exactly as you wish. there are unknowns. the unknowns over the course of a year have been, believe it or not, somewhat consistent. it&#039;s not all butter, there are some hairs in the food too. take that shit and add it to your conception of reality, and then base your plans and decisions off of it, all the while knowing that any fucking minute could throw you a new monkey wrench. if you try and model your imaginary universe off of this or that sliver of time and experience your imagination will fill in the void and take you places you never wanted to go. stick to the facts, stick to reality, quit making assumptions, and take it or leave it.

				I also have a 15+ years of software development, and agree that sometimes it takes far longer than you think to get software problems fixed. Especially when you&#039;re dealing with things like sudden, large, increases in user volume. Add on top of that the fact that your site needs to be iron-tight and completely anonymous, and it may take a while to fix problems. On normal websites if you mess up you get fired. Here if you mess up on security you get life in prison. So you have to be careful, and people should respect that!<br /><br />What gets me nervous is when the site is down this long they may be having other problems like data loss. Maybe they lost account data (ie. your bitcoins) or other transactional data. I really hope they didn&#039;t considering I have 40+ bc attached to my account at the moment....<br /><br />

				It is fairly easy to see what is happening. DPR decided, some time ago, that he made enough money (which he certainly has). So why take the risk of operating the site? Of course, he couldn&#039;t just shut down the Road because BTC prices would fall and LE would be tracking his endeavors of cashing out. Instead, he faked a &quot;server crash&quot; and &quot;maintenance mode&quot; so he could cash out the BTC in relaxation (just look at the huge movements of BTC documented in this thread). This process takes several days, if not weeks, and that is the cause why the Road is still in maintenance mode. You&#039;ll see that when DPR is finished getting his cash, SR and the forums will simply cease to exist.<br />You heard it here first.

				BMR isn&#039;t quite a SR copy, just of the same role of business. As expected they look alike.<br />I was remembering when I first saw backopy, was at bitcointalk, back on the early days of SR. He was selling some cracked games or shit like that, when the shit hit the fan at SR with the gawker article and, like now, it went down for quite sometime. I recall this guy, unknown to the community up to so far, just much later he said to be the TD creator as well, to say something like &quot;I&#039;ll see what I can do&quot; and overnight he came up with BM (at the time wasn&#039;t Reloaded). It surely missed many SR features, was miles away of a carbon copy, more like eBay, you could purchase now and pay after, I may say a total fiasco. With time however it came to be more close to SR business model and v3 was a major improvement.

				Holy fuck you are seriously lack an understanding of what the feds like to call op-sec.&nbsp; That stands for operation security.&nbsp; You CAN NOT and DO NOT EVER display/post/give out information that will give the enemy ideas of what your current plan of attack is.&nbsp; That means, no updates on why the server is down, no updates on what specifically is being done, no spot on ETA for the server to be up, etc.&nbsp; You cannot maintain operational security by giving the enemy information of your current whereabouts.&nbsp; Holy fucking beejesus this is op-sec 101.<br /><br />Considering how fucking ignorant so many people are to the ideas of security DESPITE USING A WEBSITE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO PURCHASE DRUGS ONLINE... I truly wonder... If SR does get popped how many of you fucking idiots are going down with it for complete and utter failure to understand basic security measures?&nbsp; I bet 95% of the users here participate in near zero security measures.&nbsp; I also bet that using even 25% of available security features would be enough to prevent the feds from doing any more than an initial questioning especially if one was to ask for a lawyer and answer nothing... but considering you&#039;re all fucking retarded when it comes to security measures... I hope you have fun being pounded by leeroy.<br /><br />BTW, I just checked the blockchain and my coin hasn&#039;t moved.

The damage done to the trust of users will be too great for any other site to operate the same in the near future. Un-fortunately large amounts of coin are being held ransom at the moment and each day is damaging users trust more and more. Whether or not the site is trusted IF it comes back online will really depend on how the admins handle things once its running. Lets hope this is sorted soon.

				back up, and for those who cant read previous posts, only vendors can login now, everyone else will be able to in a few hours....now that everyone can unwad their panties... i found this and it made me chuckle. &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; would love it.<br /><br />&quot;A pirate of near-mythical reputation, The Dread Pirate Roberts is feared across the seven seas for his ruthlessness and swordfighting prowess, and is well known for taking no prisoners.<br />It is revealed during the course of the story that Roberts is not one man, but a series of individuals who periodically pass the name and reputation to a chosen successor. Everyone except the successor and the former Roberts is then released at a convenient port, and a new crew is hired. The former Roberts stays aboard as first mate, referring to his successor as &quot;Captain Roberts&quot;, and thereby establishing the new Roberts&#039; persona. After the crew is convinced, the former Roberts leaves the ship and retires on his earnings.&quot;<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dread_Pirate_Roberts<br />(clearnet)

				It&#039;s pretty stellar to have watched the combination of anger, confusion, and paranoia build up over the past 5 days and 66 pages, followed by the collective catharsis that is currently taking place. I felt like I was part of a community despite never interacting. There are some ugly (on the inside) motherfuckers around here, but some rational personalities too. Stoked for SR, hope it&#039;s bigger, badder, and more secure. All great social movements face great turmoil time and time again, and it appears DPR rises to the occasion consistently.<br /><br />Bowls for everyone!<br /><br />LJ

				Beaner + Sprout, I would halt on any BTC movement until you can actually log into the site. - I&#039;m just as eager. - Also if you go to page 1 (Original Post), which kept getting updated, you will see there he states that any auto-finalize, auto-vacation (due to inactivity I presume), and the like &quot;clocks&quot; I believe he referred to them as, have been stopped. So it will be a gradual restore. - <br /><br />I&#039;m just as eager as you are Beaner. <br /><br />We can all breath a collective sigh of relief. <br /><br />You&#039;d also be a fool if you did not have thought there was at least a 1% chance of LE being involved or of some other skulduggery afoot!&nbsp; - Then again, paranoia is relative to an individuals experiences, or lack thereof.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just hope there is at least something in the mail today ! !&nbsp; 5:30am Wed where I am. - Oooh shit~! Gotta put the garbage pails down to the street! - Gotta kill time anyway! - Get the kid off to school, etc. <br /><br />Nice weathering the storm with you all! - I&#039;ve been through many hurricanes, and it&#039;s just like this.

				hi :) pretty new here so please dont bite me. i had been looking forward to when it was up gain<br /><br />i guess as with most new members you may think its a troll or spammer or some like it,&nbsp; till you see the person and their behavior and such, that is fair enough to<br />i have read the front page and see that its closed for new members to reg.<br /><br />i didnt seem to fully see&nbsp; if you would be closed permanent for new members like myself or if it was till everything was up and running again and things are sorted out?<br /><br />:thumbs up:&nbsp; great job to get up and running again it must have been really hard work and many hours to.

				I have watched this thread from the beginning. The whole time, full faith in DPR and his team.<br />The trolls have quietly exited. Thank fuck for that.<br /><br />The ship will soon be up and running for existing members. Perhaps it would be a good move to keep new accounts off for a fair while. <br />

				Being in this Thread over the last few days has been an interesting experience to say the least.<br />But I don’t think it’s as black an white as everyone makes it out to be, obviously cunts like TiredOf… are just straight up wankers… but on that same note I don’t think we can all say ‘Fuck The Haters, Long Live The Road’ etc.<br />Of course I will be extremely happy if/when I can log back on to buy goods.<br />But common sense is needed, let’s not forget this is a ‘underground’ website and anything is possible – and lessons of practice should be learned. I’m not trying to be negative, just saying anything is possible here… and if the shit did hit the fan don’t go crying to mommy. <br />

				Hey all.&nbsp; So I have been an SR member for over 8 months now. I don&#039;t really post that often on the forums but since SR went down I have been following this thread.&nbsp; First I am so happy to see that black login page (even if I can&#039;t get on right now) however I am wondering if anyone is nervous about doing business on SR since its been down so long.&nbsp; I know people with legal online businesses and if their server was down a 1/2 a day that is too long.&nbsp; I am not trying to start any conspiracy theory here but I am just wondering if we are walking into a trap and instead of receiving a package, I am getting a knock on the door from LE.&nbsp; Again, I am not trying to start anything, I am just wondering if anyone out there is a little nervous?

				yeah i think everyone is a bit nervous, but i think everything will return to normal. but it doesnt not help to be cautious.<br />im just stoked the actual server is back up, at least functioning for the vendors. i truely never doubted dpr, but i must say this is the longest extended period of downtown for maintenance that ive experienced in 1. 4 years. i consider it something minor, in concerns with the once possible notion that sr might have never come back up.&nbsp;

				LOL, I&#039;m not even worried about my coins being there, I have little doubt about that.&nbsp; I just wanna get on to get a tracking number for a package that should have been here by now.&nbsp; I was gonna log in to save the number right when the site went down.&nbsp; talk about bad timing!<br /><br /><br />@rfs78;&nbsp; I feel like there are just too many of us to get us one by one like that.&nbsp; I may be slightly concerned as a vendor, but even then, there will be no new info that wasn&#039;t on the site before.&nbsp; no worries.

				Fantastic work getting the site back up!!!<br /><br />I followed the forums this week, in part to snuff out my own anxiety, but also they have been a very interesting read and study of human nature!&nbsp; One thing for sure, there are very combustible ingredients here, both of which have been and can be a cause of duress.&nbsp; One is of course the reason we all are here, and the other is just plain money.&nbsp; Of course I can&#039;t propose a better system, I don&#039;t know of one.&nbsp; But addressing this problem alone, this quote from Romeo fits very well:&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;There is thy gold, worse poison to men&#039;s souls,<br />Doing more murders in this loathsome world,<br />Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.<br />I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.<br />Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.<br />Come, cordial and not poison, go with me<br />. . . for there must I use thee.<br /><br />Well, either one of these ingredients causes problems, at this point in time, but one matter remains obvious to me is that people need to learn and be patient and have little faith.&nbsp; There are going to be some losses, and some gains.&nbsp; Hopefully, on the timeline of infinity, this one instance will help.&nbsp; I respect DPR very much for the undertaking here!&nbsp; and for the patience and the wisdom and strength of character DPR continues to display.&nbsp; Thanks!!<br />

Many buyers also feel like they have to give a 5/5 and at the same time be thankful that you got the opportunity to buy it in the first place.&nbsp; I understand that many people thinks that it was worth it no matter what because its illegal and i agree that you can&#039;t expect the same from SR as from a legit shop but SR and the vendors are there for one reason - make money. <br /><br />A bit messy but i hope you get my point..<br /><br />All the best,<br />PERREY<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I take your point man for sure.<br /><br />I think the praise comes from a platform that takes out a lot of the shit that is involved with buying drug IRL.<br /><br />It all stems from that, I for one am&nbsp; grateful the platform exists and I don&#039;t have to put up with:<br />- Unreliable Dealers <br />- Absolute Dog Shit Product <br /><br />Sure you get the odd scammer here and there, but the difference of buying IRL and here is night and day...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^^^^^<br />This!&nbsp; I&#039;ve suffered droughts for way longer than 5 days IRL, and dealt with some of the sketchiest motherfuckers, only to end up with practically worthless product.&nbsp; Been scammed here once, and it was totally my fault for letting my soft side get the best of me with a pity FE.&nbsp; SR is 10x better than copping IRL, even with these glitches.&nbsp; We don&#039;t hafta kiss DPR&#039;s ass, but I appreciate what he does and what he has created!&nbsp; It&#039;s brilliant, in my feeble mind! :P

				Wow. I&#039;m not sure if the problem is withdrawals or all these people having this insane sense of self entitlement like Silk Road should just magically reopen again. Whether it was a DDoS attack, a server clean-up, a sever crash, etc at the end of the day nothing can be changed. Roberts said he and his team was in the process of preparing SR to reopen and several vendors say they have access. So...if vendors have access and a few people are getting some sort of login page, whether restricted or not, why would anyone NOT see this a positive step towards reopening? <br /><br />I&#039;m sure the Road will be back up in the next few days and once everyone logs in to make sure their BTC is or isn&#039;t there and does their casual window shopping it&#039;ll be easier to get back in. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if people should smoke more weed or less at this point. :D Either way maybe take a xanax and a VERY deep breath

				OH MY GAWD THE LOGIN SCREEN CAME UP! :O :O :O :O :O :O :O<br /><br />Seriously though I have a terrible internet connection and ALWAYS have a problem connecting to SR. If I can get to the login page everyone can. The SR team has obviously restricted access for a while b/c it says so on the login page and just refreshes when I try to get inside. So..we&#039;re close people. I mean I&#039;m sure this has been said but Roberts benefits financially to keep SR open. I guess he &quot;could&quot; run off with some BTC from each account but the amount he&#039;d make if he just kept it running has to be insanely more. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m a vendor and I was able to login once a few hours ago, easily could navigate to listings page and went to edit a listing, but when I went to upload a pic it timed out and I haven&#039;t been able to load a single page since then :(<br /><br />To try and get through I&#039;ve got about 100 tor instances running in VMs and everything refreshing the main page every 5 seconds seeing if one will load, but no luck yet.<br /><br /><br />....just kidding.<br />

				I know it&#039;s very hard to be patient in this situation, but it would probably be better for buyers to not keep hitting the login page so much just to keep getting the same message. This will only put more unneeded demand on the server while the vendors are trying to do their thing. I&#039;d say check once every couple hours or so and just keep looking here. Someone will surely alert everyone when it&#039;s open.

				I feel like everything is going to be up and running soon! I can tell they have been working on the site ALL DAY for the past couple of days at the least! It&#039;s obvious because it first said only sellers could login and now it times out on me (I&#039;m only a buyer) but I have been a member of the SR for quite a while now and they have been down before. Everyone always panics and freaks out each and every time there is an interruption in service, but in the end they always get it back up and running for us&nbsp; :) <br /><br />The only thing that is going to suck is that when it DOES start working again it&#039;s going to be&nbsp; S-L-O-W!!! because everyone who has an account will probably be logging in!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />As for sellers losing money, they didn&#039;t lose my money because I have been waiting for the site to get back up and running and I will place my order then. It&#039;s just that instead of getting 30 orders a day (or whatever they normally get) they will get more like 300 orders a day for a few days&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />******** :D :D :D I want to send a HUGE Thanks to all the folks that are working on the site to get it back up for us! Those guys deserve our support, not a bunch of bitching,whining, complaining etc.! So, thanks ALLOT guys and gals at Silk Road for all your hard work!!&nbsp; :) :) :) <br /><br />Peace!

				Halleluja brothers and sisters. I was so relieved this morning when I saw that little login screen. I was so worried about the site disapearing, I should never have doubted DPR and the SR team, I appreciate it all so much more now, this site is a miracle, no others compare.<br /><br />I thought there would be huge problems caused by the down time but there isnt, vendors are going on sorting all the orders out and it is just like the SR clock stopped Friday afternoon and started again now so there are not many problems or consequences. Its amazing. Im so happy. <br /><br />Long live The Silk Road and Dread Pirate Roberts.

				I just finally successfully listed an item after getting partially there a bunch of times and then getting timeouts over and over for an hour.&nbsp; Took most of the day to get ~6 page loads...<br /><br />Not to be the Negative Nancy in the room, but if this is JUST vendors hitting the site (and buyers hitting the main page like crazed maniacs, which isn&#039;t very bandwidth intensive anyway), then how&#039;s it going to be any better when all users are logged in loading pages / etc.?<br /><br />Or is it just me having this problem? haha.

I know what it takes to run a site, let alone one like SR,<br />and it is no fun when 1000&#039;s of people pounding on ya to get the site running! I hope all users take the events of the last few days<br />to really improve their selling and buying. I know it&#039;s a far fetched dream to see the scammers and bullshit artists to go away or<br />simply change their ways, but, there is always hope! I&#039;m not preaching but this is for everyone, and respect your fellow SR&#039;s!!!<br /><br />Rock on, peace, and keep it running, long n strong, all day long!!!!<br /><br />Great to be back!

				congrats SR-team for getting the site back online...!!! i&#039;m an IT-admin myself&nbsp; and i think i can imagine what you went through the last days. not sure, what infrastructure this whole thing is based on, but outages like this always remind you that in order to achieve a maximum availability you need redundancy pretty much on every level (storage, network, server (incl. web-server, database-server, etc.) , switches, routers, cabling, power). of course a professional provider can provide that, but this platform is not something you run with professional provider like amazon or google. ;)<br /><br />i guess you will have a proper analysis of the whole thing to be able to improve the potential weak spots in your infrastructure.<br /><br />talking about infrastructure, is there some information available about what your infrastructure looks like or is based on? just curious, comes with the job.<br /><br />about the bitcoins-transfers:<br />not sure, but since processing is currently halted, i would expect that any new incoming coins will just be queued and will be transferred, once the processing starts again. well, can&#039;t be sure though. i for myself will not transfer coins until tomorrow morning.<br /><br />again, THANKS SR-team for bringing the site back online. live long and prosper...

				Can I just congratulate us all for creating an 83 page topic? I wish the forum was always this active haha.<br />Glad SR is back up! If anybody&#039;s missing money that doesn&#039;t turn up in a few days they should contact DPR, I&#039;ve lost money in the previous downtime and got it all back from him. Do wait for a few days though, it might very well just be stuck in the server backlogs. Or in the blockchain which needs a while to process the money that&#039;s now all freed up on the servers. No need to ask for money if it&#039;s already on it&#039;s way.

Or does it simply mean that there will be a delay before the coins show up in my SR account?<br /><br />PLEASE somebody give me some insight, I&#039;m having a panic attack, all my money was in that one transfer I just made. :(<br /><br />(btw thank you DPR for the standup work, if I one day may shake your hand, I should be honored. you do a great service for humanity and ought to be acknowledged for it)

				Soooo.... when I noticed I could log in to SR, I didn&#039;t even read the forums (actually couldn&#039;t get them to load with the time I had)... So I planned out my order, did my BTC transaction, and just finished up the order no problem. About 45 mins for the [wallet] to SR account transaction.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />And it looks like I just had pretty awesome timing!

				jesus christ i just spent the last half hour just trying to log in.. i either a.) get the login screen but keep getting &#039;login failed, please try again&#039; or b.) connection has reset error<br /><br />so i can&#039;t tell if 1.) i just can&#039;t remember my password (or if my password got corrupted due to the downtime or something) or 2.) my account still even exists or 3.) if i locked my account for too many failed attempts (does the site do that?) or 4.) if only vendors are allowed to log in still ?? The first page UTC updates are nice but w/o a date to go along with the timestamps it&#039;s hard to tell which day which update is for.. <br /><br />and of course there&#039;s no &#039;forgot my password&#039; link so i don&#039;t know what i&#039;m supposed to do next, i got some bitcoinage on my account so i don&#039;t want to just create a new account (not to mention my account reputation is in damn good standing would be a shame to throw that away)<br /><br />halp?<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />of course as soon as i post this message, i finally am able to log in (with a password i swear it told me was invalid before, but maybe i just fsck&#039;d up the captcha that time?).&nbsp; Anyway still getting the intermittant &#039;Connection has been reset&#039; errors here and there but at least i am reunited at last with my precious bitcoinage!)

				I&#039;m having some trouble with my bitcoins. On the 9th, before the downtime, I deposited some money via a MoneyGram into my SR account. The blockchain site confirmed that it went, and I also received an email from ZipZap and bitinstant confirming the payment. However, very recently the blockchain site had an outgoing arrow (I assume this means the money was sent out of my account) to two other addresses. <br /><br />Does this mean my bitcoins were stolen somehow? They&#039;re still not in my account. I can provide SR support with the emails and the blockchain link if it&#039;d help. I sent in a support message.

				I&#039;m going to guess that at least some of the the movement on blockchain (bitcoins being transferred around) was due to DPR re-tumbling them.&nbsp; SR has a tumble mechanism built in, but if there was a suspected security breach-- something we will hopefully get more info on in the next few days-- then DPR might have felt it necessary to re-work the SR wallets.&nbsp; If you&#039;re missing coins just message support.

				i can definitely understand why people are upset - i was one of the lucky ones who not only got in and made an order, but made contingencies in case it goes down again for a while.<br /><br />but don&#039;t leave it down for 6 days saying the length of the delay is so this never happens again, only for it to happen again less than 24 hours later.<br /><br />if it has been deliberately taken down for more work, people should&#039;ve been told.<br /><br />i still refuse to believe that this is any sort of a scam - although it&#039;s a brilliant way to do it if it is. open it, take a shitload of deposits, then keep them all.<br /><br />the problem with it is that if we use the $50m estimate in a previous post, how would you offload the bitcoins? if you try and offload any reasonable percentage of that amount, the btc rate will nose dive.<br /><br />if he did do it, it would take him 10 years before he could cash it all out.

				I can just imagine DPR getting a kick out of all this. Imagine, you single-handedly have the power to make or break lives, uplift or ruin emotions, and make people go batshit crazy/paranoid. Not to mention the ability to run away with god-knows-how-much in coins. It&#039;s all too amusing to see even from my perspective. Do we really need a disclaimer to warn us?

				I just want to know where the missing 150 BTC&#039;s I sent while the outage happened are. I sent a miniscule payment to my SR wallet and that showed up, but my deposit of 150 BTC was removed yesterday according to the blockchain.<br /><br />SR support contacted me asking for the deposit address which is the same address in my account ATM, and I sent them all the necessary transaction ID&#039;s and they haven&#039;t yet got back to me.<br /><br />It feels very peculiar why they would message me asking for information and when I reply within ten minutes they&#039;ve forgotten all about it.

				Heres the lowdown. This guy is running out of options. Tried to blackmail DPR. DPR has rebuilt the site. He has no other exploitable vulnerabilities except for denial of service.<br /><br />Assuming DPR did his homework with regards to password security this ass clown has a fuckton of password hashes&nbsp; to crack offline. Worst case you should all be changing your password and removing all bitcoins from your accounts.<br /><br />Best case, DPR already found this shit out and fixed it, probably getting all vendors to change passwords immediately.<br /><br />Either way this guy is obviously out of options because he isn&#039;t doing shit except for posting random unverifiable shit on an anonymous forum and dossing. <br /><br />BTW ultra hacker your message doesnt pgp verify can you post it as an attachment or something? kthxbai!

				Wish I could help DPR and his small team, but my expertise is solely in Programming, not Networks or even Websites.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure he and the gang are giving it 110% and we just need to stand back, relax a little and watch.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Essentially it&#039;s about having faith - DPR is a very special person and the Silk Road is a very special place.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; Unfortunately its having difficulties coping with its popularity. I&#039;ve noticed the SR Forum&#039;s membership has recently grown from 27,000 back in June 2012 to 45,000 in Nov 2012 - this current rate of growth for an onion site is what is causing all the problems.<br /><br />Maybe SR will have to split into a small number of sites each containing different drugs, just to make the numbers manageable again - One for Lucy, one for Ganga, one for Heroin etc...&nbsp; :)

				lol u guys are smoking way to many drugs man.<br />the fact of the matter is SR has been flakey for months now and the rocks have finally caved in. it just cant deal with the amount of users it has at the moment along with the probable government attacks on it. The site owners need to come up with a serious brainy plan to take this project to the next level, i just only hope they they have people with the skills able to do so.<br /><br />

				I really think some issues on these forums needs to be solved to help things aswel.<br />Is there a way to implement a system on here where you can only post on the forums if you have a vendor or buyer account?<br />Theres so much trolling and newbies asking the sames questions without doing some research.<br />This is just causing mass panic and increasing the load on the site when it goes up.<br />Surely cleaning up here will have a good effect on the site aswel.<br />:)

				May be it would be a good idea to allow access only for vendors and buyers with purchases at the moment until the problem is solved? I think there are many people with 0 purchases only for strolling on the road.

				shook: those are false.<br /><br />DPR:&nbsp; IDEA!&nbsp; Have SR&#039;s onion address just access the login page, on a VM or server separate from the rest of the website but still with access.&nbsp; Upon login, check credentials, and see if the user is either a vendor or a buyer with outstanding orders, and if so, forward them off to a separate temporary server with different resources, that way people hammering the login page or who aren&#039;t qualified, or if someone is DDoS&#039;ing the site (over TOR? hmmm seems unlikely without us observing it in network traffic from key nodes!), well, then they wouldn&#039;t have the active / real url &#039;less they were one of the above user types.

				Remember when Dread said they had to sleep and would get back on it? Well they did, didn&#039;t they? and it worked, and they probably are just waking up to this now. <br /><br />Time will tell. <br /><br />Everything was back up for buyers, with outstanding, and finalization orders pending, I was able to leave feedback, release funds, even placed a new order. By the time Europe started falling asleep, it got super fast! I had 5-6 screens going in seperate windows, and under 5 second load times. Then around 3am NY time, so like UK, Germany, etc, that was your &quot;wake up&quot; time, and those in earlier time zones, India, etc, were getting on. It started to get real slow real fast, and then Kaput! - Overloaded servers. <br /><br />The conspiracy theorists came out of the woodwork with newbie accounts mostly, I mean you&#039;d be crazy not to have at least a 1% possiblity that it was something other than the &quot;rush hour&quot; effect. Too many cars, and not enough lanes to carry them all. Backups, gridlock (NYC term when the entire intersections lock up). <br /><br />Take a &quot;wait + see&quot; attitude. - Then again, I only stand to lose a few hundred. I don&#039;t have the luxury of knowing what it&#039;s like to have 500 btc&#039;s or more. That is a the gamble you take on here. Some are higher rollers than others. <br /><br />I have a gut feeling, it will come back. I mean last night (8 hours ago) - It was like the good old days, and I had forgotten all about the stoppage. You&#039;ll see, it will come back. Much more money to be made. <br /><br />&quot;You gotta know when to hold &#039;em. Know when to fold &#039;em&quot; - as the song goes. It is by far too early in this game for the casino to close. <br /><br />Lot&#039;s of servers used worldwide are centered in the financial district of NYC, some of which is still flooded from Hurricane Sandy, so there are a lot of things to take into account. DPR is not just going to come out and share that, I know, because I installed many of them after 9/11. Not an IT pro, just a technician, but I learned a lot that Fall+Winter of 2001, and how bandwith is sold, at night for instance when the NYSE is closed, those servers are humming away like it&#039;s opening bell and Apple just announced it&#039;s new flying car! <br /><br />Lot&#039;s of forces at work here people. Kind of have to look from &quot;outside of the box&quot; - to use an annoying corporate cliche. Keep the faith!

				An emergency mode where you could only withdraw funds and update existing order statuses and cancel existing orders would be ideal. Kinda unlikely though, either the servers are available and working or they aren&#039;t.<br /><br />I doubt it is impossible, but having a tor site with redundant hardware in separate physical locations sharing one set of data to offer virtually no down-time is clearly no easy task.

				kvalitetsbevisst - I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re not in the US. I think he gave us our time overnight last night, while most of Europe was sleeping, then the shit hit the fan when you all woke up, and we were didn&#039;t want to go to bed! LOL! - I mentioned that about 6-7 hours ago in this thread! Then I come on a little while ago, and people are saying, - those damn Americans are waking up, THATS what it is !!!<br /><br />Funny how we think the same way. <br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s working here, working there. I got my speed in the mail, so I don&#039;t care!!&nbsp; <br /><br />La di da, La di da.<br /><br />OK, I&#039;ll stop. <br /><br />There are other sites like this. Check out Blackmarket Reloaded. If I&#039;d found that before SR, I&#039;d be shopping there. A lot of vendors are on both sites. I made an account yesterday, and it&#039;s very close to this site, just looks a little older, software wise. Like before SR updated the site this summer with the smoother edges. <br /><br />Oh and karma you get to give or take away after like 100 posts or something. You could be a seller on here for a year, but your rating on the forums is just based on how many posts you make. Really makes no sense. There&#039;s like parts of this forum that discusses Dungeons and Dragons (I know, crazy, right?) - They go on and on. Other subjects too. Then they have HERO STATUS on the forums, because they simply cannot shut up!!! LOL!<br /><br />Taking a break. Later kiddies!

				Springseed23 - why the hostility? I already told the guy. You must be a blast to hang out with. We&#039;re all on edge, most of us because we&#039;re running low on what makes us feel good. Gotta be tough, but don&#039;t gotta be mean to someone newer than you. The whole Silk Road is fucked up. Who cares about forum rules at this point?? I mean besides you obviously.

				Server is still up and running, just really really really really hard to get a connection to.<br /><br />DPR should just disable CAPTCHA. With no new registrations, what good can someone do with a bot and an SR account other than spam a few messages (like they do on this forum, but unlike the forum they cant re-register after ban)? Waste of precious bandwidth and CPU resources if you ask me.

				bincofone, you have had a series of very useful posts that would probably help give DPR a new direction to try.&nbsp; <br />Your logic is sound.&nbsp; I encourage you to start a thread SPECIFICALLY design to security and networking.<br />Those who are especially savvy with the Tor network should due their duty to help put out this fire.<br /><br />There are probably a half million or more bitcoins in people&#039;s wallets.<br /><br />If this shit goes down badly, the price of bitcoin will drop significantly and we will see the market in general wane with bitcoin.<br />It will be great for some, and horrible for others.&nbsp; But it will shake the market is the worst part.&nbsp; It will discourage interaction with bitcoin.<br /><br />I think we need to keep bitcoin strong.&nbsp; Whether that means we create a new and improved alternative to SR and BMR.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or if we try to reach out to DPR and help him in what ever generic but hopefully useful ways that we can.<br /><br />This thread that you started is very valuable.&nbsp; HERE HERE!!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72574.0

				If there will be no update from the admins today, I think it could have two reasons. Either they feel embarrassed because they have temporally lost control (whatever the problem may be) or they have switched the sides and the restricted access was a big honey pot for the vendors. I hope I am wrong in both cases, so other suggestions are welcome.

				I just got the login screen for the first time since like 9 hours ago when we were getting 3 characters. This time no characters. I clicked on the reload image, but nothing. I right-clicked on the image space, and it (Firefox) gave me interesting info. I should&#039;ve screen shot it. Basically said I was accessing a non secure website, and that I had never visited this website before. <br /><br />Interesting. Of course I hit &quot;Go&#039; and back to &quot;problem loading page&quot;. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been out and about and only one other person I know who knows about and uses this site hasn&#039;t had much luck, not a vendor., just a buyer like me. <br /><br />That&#039;s my personal update.

				I&#039;ve been a member for a while but a first time poster on the forums. The site may be down again as of today the 15th. I have tried during different intervals all day&nbsp; to log on but to no avail. I think too many people trying to get on crashed the server or it could be any number of issues we just are not aware of. I would like to say this though......................<br /><br />Just give us an update and perhaps shut down to traffic for just vendors only so that all of the people who placed orders yesterday (for the brief period the SR was available!) can get those processed and shipped out before opening up the site for all users. I myself placed an order and was hoping it would be processed today, but i have no way to tell if the vendor has done that yet. But patience is a virtue and I have plenty. <br /><br />*******PS!!!!!!!!!! While typing this post i was able to log in and am currently on the SR...............PEOPLE PLEASE HEED THIS WARNING THOUGH.........PLEASE EVERYONE, TRY NOT TO JUMP ON ALL AT ONCE. GIVE THE VENDORS A CHANCE TO TAKE CARE OF SOME BACK ORDERS AND ALLOW BTC TO BE DEPOSITED FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM. THINK OF YOUR FELLOW SR COMMUNITY AND KARMA WILL BLESS YOU!

I&#039;ll let you know here if we do.&nbsp; A side note about withdrawals:&nbsp; There have been a ton of them (understandable), so we are getting through them as fast as possible.&nbsp; Please be patient if we haven&#039;t gotten to yours yet.<br /><br />UPDATE (2254 UTC 11/15/2012): The site went down again and there are people claiming to be responsible for it and making threats.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to take any chances, so the site is going to come down for a bit while we investigate what is going on.&nbsp; Hopefully this is short lived... what drama!&nbsp; Next update will come before 0600 UTC.<br /><br />UPDATE (2355 UTC): Deposits are working.&nbsp; All outstanding deposits have been processed, and future deposits will be processed as usual.&nbsp; If you sent a deposit before or during the outage and your account has not been credited, message support so we can investigate your issue.&nbsp; Some withdrawals have been processed, but there is still a queue we are working through.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update when withdrawals are back to normal.<br /><br />UPDATE (2052 UTC): Current members now have full access to Silk Road.&nbsp; Registrations are still closed until we are certain we can handle the additional traffic.&nbsp; We are still unable to process deposits and withdrawals, but are getting very close.&nbsp; I will start a new thread with some commentary on this whole situation once we are running 100%.<br /><br />UPDATE(0850 UTC): Silk Road is available once again, but on a limited basis.&nbsp; New user registrations are closed for the time being.&nbsp; Access is limited to vendors only.&nbsp; New deposits and withdrawals (and any that were sent just before or during the outage) will not be processed until some time in the next 24 hours.&nbsp; Assuming all goes well, access for all current members will be made available some time in the next 24 hours.<br /><br />UPDATE (0012 UTC):&nbsp; Sorry I&#039;m late on this update, won&#039;t happen again.&nbsp; We&#039;re pretty much polishing and going down the final check list at this point.&nbsp; I&#039;m confident we&#039;ll make our &quot;matter of days&quot; estimate and this won&#039;t be drawn out into week+ territory (assuming nothing goes wrong when we reopen).&nbsp; When we reopen, access will be limited to vendors only for a few hours so they can mark packages shipped that were sent but not marked before we went down.&nbsp; Also, auto-finalize and auto-vacation haven&#039;t been running since Sunday, and we won&#039;t fire those back up for a couple of days after we reopen so everyone can get square first.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait till this is behind us :)&nbsp; Next update before 1500 UTC Wednesday.<br /><br />UPDATE (1113 UTC): I and the team need sleep.&nbsp; Getting really close now, home stretch (hopefully).&nbsp; Next update will come before 2300 UTC, Tuesday.<br /><br />UPDATE (0924 UTC): I know you won&#039;t like hearing this, but we aren&#039;t quite there yet.&nbsp; We are working hard and getting closer though.&nbsp;

				Ya i&#039;m gettin the same. keep getting kicked back to the login. trying to see if any orders have got marked in transit so I can finalize. So hopefully that might ensure they will get sent if any vendors are nervous of the coins not reaching them if their stuck in escrow and the site goes down again. Then there&#039;s the chance i&#039;ll do that and the it will go down after and the vendor won&#039;t be able to get on for a day or 2. Hopefully they manage a proper fix soon.

Does anyone? Did it move somewhere else or is this useful function gone?<br /><br />It seems I typed it right in the time with OP updating. Nice.<br />The questions still stays for me.

				Thanks DPR looking through these posts over the last week i really dont understand what the fuck some of these clowns are even doing on SR totally ungrateful and clueless. They are the ones who give substance users a bad name. I am fully aware some need their meds but also they need to learn this is a cottage industry and things go wrong from time to time. It also don&#039;t help matters when you have morons moaning that despite retrying 30 times an hour for hours on end the sites still down. No shit! unless your in the middle of a transaction use your brains and stay away a few days until things are stable again. hitting reload constantly and moaning the sites down is like a gang kicking the fuck out of you whilst moaning that you wont stand on your feet. just chill out and everything will be good in a few days. much love and peace x

				Yeah the amount I deposited today was smaller than the initial amount, which was small enough to begin with.&nbsp; Anyway what I have confirmed is that my address does work, and that the btc that I sent on the 9th appears to be lost somewhere.&nbsp; I have no idea what happened to it, but I know that I am able to receive btc.<br /><br />Anyway I was just wondering if there is anyone out there that actually has gotten there btc from pre-sr crash.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing the answer is most if not all of us have not but it would be reassuring to know if someone actually has.

				<br />SAME THIng happening to me right now with my bitcoins showing now as SPENT and being relayed somewhere else.... do you think Support team is behind this? Maybe they&#039;re relaying it to one of their address and then will send it right back so their actual system will actually update our balance on the main system?

				Dear SR boys n girls,<br />Things are working their way out and thats great. Current members are slowly getting things going. Im waiting for a different kind of update: when can I sign up for a new account? Im not your normal situation. How many vendors are losing sales because new members who have been waiting to sign up are looking more and more at other options. Before anyone goes off on loyalty to SR I think judging by this last &quot;situation&quot; (what does your dealer usually tell you? A &quot;situation&quot; came up but I will come through) people behave as they do in the streets when it comes down to it. This is business and where as there are always going to be pros and cons (security included) there will (just like the street) always be those other guys you call when you cant reach your normal hookup. How many loyal SR users found themselves browsing other sites more during this time? How much more did business increase for other sites? DPR has been losing money during this &quot;situation&quot;. Im sure its alot so I know his best interest is in getting things going. Not to mention the stress has got to be just as bad as it is for some of the members on this board during this time. Just in a different way. Bravo on not getting caught up in it. So im not trying to be a hammer on anyone I just want to make it loud and clear that there are new users still waiting to sign up. My significant other gets the account we used together (I got the dog!) so before anyone makes too big of an assumption about me I have been here just like you. I didnt lose any BTC or anything but I have been waiting and reading just like the rest. Starting over has alot of complications for a buyer just think about it. I will NOT mention the other name either-to anyone. We are 2 seperate individuals with seperate habits and behaviors. I do not want to be associated with that account or person. So I figure now that I have addressed a larger scope of the &quot;situation&quot; and have brought perspectives to other users &quot;situations&quot; that maybe I can get DPR to notice my comment and mention whats up in an update (thats what IM waiting for) or maybe a fellow user has an idea im not aware of. I will NOT buy someone elses account. Im not going to even say anything about that.<br />Love and kisses.<br />-El Dopo the DwaRf with One eYe

Sure it was fun in the midst, but some of you keep railing on after it&#039;s been confirmed by many ACTUAL USERS that the site works fine and hell, vendors have been withdrawing huge amounts of BTC.

				@TheGoodSon<br /><br />Just because things are working for others and yourself does not mean it works for everybody. Needless to say we&#039;ve all sent the sr support team messages, but you can understand the frustration of missing money, no? Or are you a saintly person perhaps? Whatever the case is, we&#039;re complaining on the forums so that the issue is public. We&#039;ve all got proof too.

				Donnyberger-<br />Im just curious but why would DPR want to block new registrations? If even more people are trying to get on isnt that a good thing? Do we (you) not want anymore users in SR or is it full? So the vendors that are there can have the existing buyers only. As time goes on and vendors fade away does DPR open it up to just new vendors? As well as you are restricting vendors to the existing members only. Where will new registers go? Thats where the vendors will follow to and SR will lose out on all of that business. When you say &quot;a way to block all these morons&quot; I assume you are refering to all the current members who flipped out while SR was down? Both vendors and buyers. As well as you must be refering to the existing members that are trying to scam for BTCs. Has nothing to do with new registers. I think the bottom line is you have an account and its working and thats all you are thinking about. Also if you consider the site going down and having its members freaking out about being ripped off is limelight I question your thinking all together. If anything it made members pull their BTCs out and others steer clear but thats what you would have anyway. New registers they wernt here when you were so by seniority that makes you superior. I have met people like that. They usually wont help other users (definately not newbies) and look at themselves as privlidged for &quot;being there first&quot; although they are just another one of the masses. Its easy to call others behaviors obnoxious when you have no investment in the object that is at risk. I would like to see (although I can predict) how you would behave if the situation was different. If you had a large amount of BTC or maybe someone elses tied up. Maybe you can afford to juggle the money around but not everyone can. Im not saying everyones reactions were sensible but there is a justifiable reason to be worried and for that and combined with their different characters and the variables of their addiction as well as their financial state--I understand as I think DPR does. Thus the reason he has handled this professionaly and not got caught up in the commotion. Everyone understands the risk and I dont think there is anyone who doesnt thank DPR and everyone else that contributes to what makes this all work (its not just DPR) but at the same time these people are also contributing to the community that is at the heart of this. They pay their fees and follow the rules. These people make the system possible and in that respect and in this particular case forgiveness and understanding should be at the top of everyones list right now. Then there is the other foot that you can try my shoe on: im a SR member who split with their significant other. I need to start an account of my own now. I have been waiting just like you. Should I be &quot;halted&quot; from registering a new account? What if it was you that just found SR like some of the new registers have. You remember how excited you were to see it? Well you cant join because your new. Hopefully you can understand where im coming from and you take this the right way. Try not to have a &quot;spazathon&quot; over it. ;)

Too many abuse the system as it is, but never the less the registration is not closed forever so maybe your personal spazathon should relax down.<br /><br />These threads are pointless.

				Fat people...<br />I dont need to write anything over at BMR they arent having these issues. Also I was respoinding to a comment left by another user which was not you. You dont think but that also means you dont know if SR will be taking new registers or not. So again your just another member who has a working account. You have no new information to give it just adds another posting to your count.<br />&quot;What with spam accounts, dumbass teenagers, threat of undercover LE, overall traffic and scamsters&quot; is this something new? You make it sound like SR is comprised of a bunch of scammers and dumbass teenagers. Good thing im not a new user or a dumbass teenager or a teenager for that matter (I just need a new account) or you might have made me feel as if SR is run by a bunch of half asses which I know its not. Its funny how you are treated in this forum under a different name. I dont think a newbie like yourself would have even commented if I wasnt using this new name. I know your just playing up to the users in this forum that are higher up then you but they are just people. Its a forum and if you have alot of time and HELP people you too can become a hero member. That doesnt mean you are better or that what you say is law. People can be wrong even if they have posted 1000s of postings and are a hero member. Looking at what I said in that posting (and I really dont see where it had anything to do with you or how it even provoked you other then what I said above) I dont think I was offensive at all. I think I speak for others when I wrote that. I know im not alone-maybe in the particular details but thats it. I want to get on just like everyone else . Im not some punk kid who just found SR while taking a break from WOW. I put my time in. I paid my dues meaning I have been ripped off in the ever persuit of creating a safer environment on SR. I have contributed to the community by being honest and being a loyal and frequent user. I have been here the same as everyone else. Treat me with respect and I will do the same. Writing novels is easy when you know the words. Hope you understand. If you need more clearification I can write these novels all day n night for you.

The way I used it was in a sarcastic sense to imply that his reaction was of the same caliber. So I cant see it as being wrong in its use. You say vendor accounts are more dangerous then buyer accounts but based on what? What if im the president of the US? Do you think a vendor would face as much trouble as me? Also vendors have the ability to just drop off a package with no return address or a fake one if they like. Buyers have to recieve the items which is where it is usually caught at. So I think danger is a perspective. Do vendors risk more then buyers in transactions? Thats debateable and depends on different factors but I could see how that could be more dangerous. I got a divorce if you must know and it happens. Im not going to ask for the account from my lawyer. I use SR regularly so this has been a hard time especially for me--so thank you for saying your sorry although I feel it was sarcastic. I say significant other because I am not going to revel jack about myself anywhere if I dont have to. I dont care what anyone says if im vague I feel better. As far as looking for a sweet spot in the the staffs hearts that was never my intention. I am simply the voice that is asking when new registrations will be open and I explained my situation in case there was an alternative. I made sure that I made myself heard hoping that DPR might see it and throw out an update reguarding it. All of my posts have been calm. Never have I asked with pressure or impatience. Determination yes. The sad thing is do you know how many non-scammers contacted me asking if I wanted to buy an account? I say non-scammers because these are long standing members that have vendor accounts. So as far as im concerned this isnt always about community and safety its about money. Money always=greed. So while SR members may think theyre keeping the scammers out by not allowing new registers the members are selling accounts to anyone who will pay enough. Thats BS. No matter what you limit the members to you are going to have scammers its the nature of this business and in the online world. Limiting members isnt going to fix that something else has to be decided but I do understand and agree that something should be done. If there are more users then the system can handle then the thing to do would be expand to meet the market or put implements in place to weed out the scammers or else it will crash like it did/does. Otherwise other sites pop up offering the same things which is what is happening. Now I know that SR is great but other sites can reach this same height with work so its not as if SR will be the only option in years to come. There is a new site being built now that many members of this forum are assisting with so its not a matter of not being loyal to SR its just the way things go. People will always build bigger and bette/safer methods to the ones that are existing. Just to be clear I have not spazzed out or got angry irritated or frustrated at any point. Im able to exist without SR but who wants to do that? These threads have a way of going off on their own tangents so I know nothing is going to be solved here but I bet you DPR will see that new registers are in fact waiting now with these posts and make an announcement in the next update. Thanks for the banter back n forth I think this novel will be my last for today.

				Also I just want to bring one more thing up to everyone who has been reading these. I like everyone else have been waiting during the down time and I love seeing people sigh with relief seeing the site is back up but the whole time it was down I was here with you and I thought I would be able to get on when everyone else did. So it is hard seeing comments like its so nice....etc. knowing I have to still wait and judging by peoples attitudes I wouldnt get in at all if they had their way. I want to sigh with relief and get in touch with my favorite vendors. I have money but no outlet-yet. I am envious not jealous. I am no different then you. I only ask that you take one second to think about that. Apreciate what you have.

If even more people are trying to get on isnt that a good thing? Do we (you) not want anymore users in SR or is it full? So the vendors that are there can have the existing buyers only. As time goes on and vendors fade away does DPR open it up to just new vendors? As well as you are restricting vendors to the existing members only. Where will new registers go? Thats where the vendors will follow to and SR will lose out on all of that business. When you say &quot;a way to block all these morons&quot; I assume you are refering to all the current members who flipped out while SR was down? Both vendors and buyers. As well as you must be refering to the existing members that are trying to scam for BTCs. Has nothing to do with new registers. I think the bottom line is you have an account and its working and thats all you are thinking about. Also if you consider the site going down and having its members freaking out about being ripped off is limelight I question your thinking all together. If anything it made members pull their BTCs out and others steer clear but thats what you would have anyway. New registers they wernt here when you were so by seniority that makes you superior. I have met people like that. They usually wont help other users (definately not newbies) and look at themselves as privlidged for &quot;being there first&quot; although they are just another one of the masses. Its easy to call others behaviors obnoxious when you have no investment in the object that is at risk. I would like to see (although I can predict) how you would behave if the situation was different. If you had a large amount of BTC or maybe someone elses tied up. Maybe you can afford to juggle the money around but not everyone can. Im not saying everyones reactions were sensible but there is a justifiable reason to be worried and for that and combined with their different characters and the variables of their addiction as well as their financial state--I understand as I think DPR does. Thus the reason he has handled this professionaly and not got caught up in the commotion. Everyone understands the risk and I dont think there is anyone who doesnt thank DPR and everyone else that contributes to what makes this all work (its not just DPR) but at the same time these people are also contributing to the community that is at the heart of this. They pay their fees and follow the rules. These people make the system possible and in that respect and in this particular case forgiveness and understanding should be at the top of everyones list right now. Then there is the other foot that you can try my shoe on: im a SR member who split with their significant other. I need to start an account of my own now. I have been waiting just like you. Should I be &quot;halted&quot; from registering a new account? What if it was you that just found SR like some of the new registers have. You remember how excited you were to see it? Well you cant join because your new. Hopefully you can understand where im coming from and you take this the right way. Try not to have a &quot;spazathon&quot; over it. ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well for the time being the site has obvs been struggling so the obvious thing would be to do would be halt new users. Dpr has already commented on the &#039; explosive growth&#039;<br />I dont think at the moment SR will lose any buisness.<br />It was mostly newbies who flipped out but thats my opinion.<br /><br />Ive only just started as a vendor. after a week of it working out, it was down for a week so yes i can clearly see new ppl registering needs to be halted. I was also a buyer from near the start of SR so i can see how the issue has come about. Im thinking about all the decent vendors and buyers and future registrations. I would rather DPR took time to improve the site instead of allowing new accounts and crashing the site again. You will find the longer serving members didnt panic withdraw BTC&#039;s. Im not superior i just want the site to work. I understand there are decent sensible ppl who want to register an account. Im not saying they cant because they are new, im saying not having anyone new register is the sensible thing to do as the site cant handle it right. and a lot of the newbs comments on here arent going to help to persuade DPR to change his mind anytime soon.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is what im talking about. I agree with you in your clearified statement. I understand both sides but your original post came off in a different way or thats how I took it. I always say the problem with textsemails is there is no tone of voice. people shorten their thoughts and misunderstandings happen. Thanks for your professional response. I take back the points in which I thought you were presenting yourself as superior. ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is not a rant or dig at you two i just thought it was relevant to the conversation<br /><br />From all the retarded comments Ive been reading on this thread it seems that the ones who talk the most bollocks already have SR accounts, they are just new to the forum. I think its not so much about the quantity of customers but the quality of customers. There&#039;s been way too many ranting and raving because they might loose a couple of hundred quid. Boo hoo, these are the people who need to be ejected as they obviously have no idea about the drug trade. Id like to see them bitch and moan if they done a deal down a back alley and got a gun in their face and ripped off at the same time. Would they shout &quot;well i don&#039;t get treated like this in my local supermarket!&quot; The mugger would probably then shoot them for being so stupid. At least they don&#039;t have that fear here thats why they rant and moan and show themselves to be true morons. This is an illicit trade and sometimes shit happens. DON&#039;T TREAT IT LIKE AMAZON!!! SR could be gone at anytime and its forum,then where you gonna go to cry? If you don&#039;t have it to loose don&#039;t leave it lying around in your SR wallet for convenience ! deposit only when your buying that way if it was to vanish you at least have cut down the damage to you. Maybe a trusted invite system is whats required so only existing members can induct new members rather than just any tom dick or harry getting access. That way at least their is some way of vetting new members and ensuring they are up to speed with the drug trade. Geeze i don&#039;t believe Ive had to state the obvious. Some people if they had brains they would be deadly.<br /><br />Again lads this wasn&#039;t aimed at you but the &#039;community&#039; or lack there of as a whole. Peace and love x

				DPR,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for all your hard work. Like many others I took things for granted. It&#039;s true what hey say: &quot;You don&#039;t know what you&#039;ve got till it&#039;s gone&quot;. A couple of months ago I was googling around trying to find some place online for pain meds. I stumbled across the Road and thought I&#039;d found heaven. And when that heaven went away for a while I was lost and afraid. Thank you for keeping us updated via this thread. I hung on the edge of my seat for each update. I could tell that you were working very hard to get the Road back up and running. I think that a lot of things were said on the forum as a result of the fear and uncertainty people were feeling. Now I know just how much this place means to me. You are really making a difference in people&#039;s lives. Again, I sincerely thank you and your team for all your hard work and effort you put in.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Sincere Regards,<br />ph3n0m

I always sa&#039;y the problem with textsemails is there is no tone of voice. people shorten their thoughts and misunderstandings happen. Thanks for your professional response. I take back the points in which I thought you were presenting yourself as superior. ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is not a rant or dig at you two i just thought it was relevant to the conversation<br /><br />From all the retarded comments Ive been reading on this thread it seems that the ones who talk the most bollocks already have SR accounts, they are just new to the forum. I think its not so much about the quantity of customers but the quality of customers. There&#039;s been way too many ranting and raving because they might loose a couple of hundred quid. Boo hoo, these are the people who need to be ejected as they obviously have no idea about the drug trade. Id like to see them bitch and moan if they done a deal down a back alley and got a gun in their face and ripped off at the same time. Would they shout &quot;well i don&#039;t get treated like this in my local supermarket!&quot; The mugger would probably then shoot them for being so stupid. At least they don&#039;t have that fear here thats why they rant and moan and show themselves to be true morons. This is an illicit trade and sometimes shit happens. DON&#039;T TREAT IT LIKE AMAZON!!! SR could be gone at anytime and its forum,then where you gonna go to cry? If you don&#039;t have it to loose don&#039;t leave it lying around in your SR wallet for convenience ! deposit only when your buying that way if it was to vanish you at least have cut down the damage to you. Maybe a trusted invite system is whats required so only existing members can induct new members rather than just any tom dick or harry getting access. That way at least their is some way of vetting new members and ensuring they are up to speed with the drug trade. Geeze i don&#039;t believe Ive had to state the obvious. Some people if they had brains they would be deadly.<br /><br />Again lads this wasn&#039;t aimed at you but the &#039;community&#039; or lack there of as a whole. Peace and love x<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Some thoughts on what you said-not aimed at attacking you or anything. The people that have been making the most noise arent just new users to the forum. Its not a matter of how long you have been using the forums that determines behaviors especially when we could be talking about addicts. I just think some people reacted diffferently then others and depending on the feedback they recieved it could go one way or the other. Based on what I saw many other members didnt help the situation with their comments. Alot of people dont want to be told they are wrong for fearing their money is gone. They also dont want to be told that this is like a back alley dealer when before this the key focus has been on building a community that runs on trust. Speaking of the the back alley senerio isnt that why we are here anyway? To avoid that sort of situation. To act more as professionals. As far as the quality of the the members goes there will never be a way to get rid of scammers completely. The nature of the business and the online world makes it near impossible to run something like this without having troublemakers. Look at eBay no matter what they implement scammers get in and scam. The quality of user ranges on eBay just like it does here. Again I dont think limiting members will fix this. Membership fees might help weed out some but having invites by current members only means that the current members that are scammers can invite their scammer friends. Members will start selling accounts (like I have been offered) and then your right back where you started Its hard to have a site where you need to protect your identity but be able to verify members are not scammers. Even legit vendors turn into scammers sometimes so you cant be sure about anyone. Think about it.You say not to treat this like Amazon but why not? That is what we all would prefer isnt it? A site that is easy to use and you can buy what you want. Lots of options and lots of content. Maybe some buyer protection? I think you might have meant dont expect it to work like Amazon meaning there are scammers? Because there are scammers on Amazon too. I get the general point that SR is an underground operation and you cant expect it to have the same policys/behaviors that Amazon has but it could run with the same efficentcy (spelling?). The drug trade and back alley dealers are two different types of entities. In truth a professional in the drug trade runs things like a business and has many of the same practices that we use on SR. Where as a back alley dealer is someone who is usually an addict themselves who sells to support their own habit and that means your going to get screwed around. Many of us have been at this for MANY years working and suffering our way through these people to get to the professionals. We remember the back alley dealers though and that could be partially why some members flipped out. People have become acustomed to trusting SR not just their favorite vendors and when it looked like they wernt getting the response they wanted out of DPR it brought up old feelings of those past back alley dealers (B.A.D) not responding and robbing them. It makes a person feel like a fool when they get taken. Being experienced in this lifestyle makes you then kick yourself for thinking anything was different and you should have known better- until SR came back up. Then they realized they put their foot in their mouth. I have experienced this with my local vendors as well as in other situations in life where I jumped the gun and in those cases you have to be humble and just apologize and learn from the situation. True professionals will usually let it go--well I guess that depends on how bad you flip out and what you say/do. I think people understand its an illicit trade but that doesnt make it any better if you get ripped off. There are chances of bad things happening and people take them but its only human nature to complain or warn others to communicate the frustration/anger. If it did turn out that DPR split with the BTC would they have been morons then? Not just that but I think this is typical of a situation like this. A bunch of people get robbed-at first no one says anything because they think its just late. Then a few start to talk and gather information and worry. Then it starts one by one each person gives up on anything coming through at some point until everyone is talking about it and is in agreement. There are people like me that even though everyone has been ripped off and its clear I will still hold out doing anything besides talking about it until long after I should have. I wont jump the gun--learned from past mistakes. So everyone is different and I dont think anyone was wrong for worrying/being angry. Yes some of the comments were overboard but like I said everyone is different. SR could be gone at anytime its true but there are and will be others. Alot of people bad talk other sites (BMR) and wont accept anything other then SR in this business but alot more people including vendors use both sites. Where did alot of people go in the downtime do you think? I dont believe everyone just sat there or just used the forums to order. If you dont have local access and your connection is down what are you going to do? What do people do locally? Call someone you dont normally go see. Is that a lack of loyalty to your dealer? No its just business. With all the choices you have in your town to eat do you just visit the one? No you go where you are treated right where the food/prices are good and where it is convienient for you. You may have a favorite but that doesnt mean you wont go anywhere else. This is what would happen if SR was gone more sites would pop up and people would migrate over. So I agree people need to apreciate SR for the wonder that it is but to treat it as if it is the last of a dying breed is backwards.&nbsp; There are people with the mindset that it takes them the buyers/vendors to make the business a business. Alot of people dont look at it like they are fortunate to be there but that SR is fortunate to have them. Not that I think that is the correct way of viewing things but others do. Also alot of these people didnt have BTC just sitting in their accounts. Not everyone just deposits BTC only when they need a quick buy. Some have BTC going back and forth all the time. Maybe they did just deposit it like you suggest but the site went down or others that made purchases but the vendors couldnt see or do anything so they did what you suggest but the timing was bad. thats just the buyers. Vendors that were waiting for escrow to release for purcahses shipped and the purchaes that are new orders that are waiting to be shipped-do they ship them? So alot of different situations could be the motivating force behind the (now I am using your word:) &quot;spazathon&quot; that took place here. All Im really saying is I think everyone needs to cut everyone a break. Those that flipped and those that didnt. You can understand someones motivations without condoning them. I dont think it is a matter of new/old members not understanding the drug trade either I agree that maybe some sort of tutorial could be written that would address what to do in the event of another &quot;spazathon&quot; (theres that word again!) sort of an in case of emergency guide. You wouldnt want me to write it. My forum postings are novels. Im sorry but its how I talk and how I write. I cant be brief no matter how I try. I read someone say that DPR will regain his credit in time after this is all over but I see it differently. The site went down and with people flipping out and all the stress that guy must have if there was going to be an oppourtunity and a reason (Its hard to fix, feds, scammers,etc) to split with everyones BTC this would have been it. Instead the guy breaks his ass getting it back up he avoids the shit flinging in here and he produces a near-finished site that sounds like it is running better and he is still at work. I know customer support was lacking in some areas but considering the amount of people that tried to contact them I can understand why that might be a factor. I imagine that as time goes by he will find ways to improve on that as well. This was most definately a learning experience for DPR as well as for us the members. I dont know if it will even happen again once the dust settles on this but if it does everyone will behave differently as well as DPR I think.&nbsp; A positive thing has come out of this in my opinion and some will see it this way and some wont but I give MORE credit/trust to DPR now. His dedication and intentions seem clear to me if only for the time being although I dont think a time will come when his intentions change. These type of guys are in it to the end whatever that may be. This is his baby and he loves it. Makes me feel alot more confidence in SR. Wrote a novel here soaponarope but im just in a discussion with you not an arguement. :D

If even more people are trying to get on isnt that a good thing? Do we (you) not want anymore users in SR or is it full? So the vendors that are there can have the existing buyers only. As time goes on and vendors fade away does DPR open it up to just new vendors? As well as you are restricting vendors to the existing members only. Where will new registers go? Thats where the vendors will follow to and SR will lose out on all of that business. When you say &quot;a way to block all these morons&quot; I assume you are refering to all the current members who flipped out while SR was down? Both vendors and buyers. As well as you must be refering to the existing members that are trying to scam for BTCs. Has nothing to do with new registers. I think the bottom line is you have an account and its working and thats all you are thinking about. Also if you consider the site going down and having its members freaking out about being ripped off is limelight I question your thinking all together. If anything it made members pull their BTCs out and others steer clear but thats what you would have anyway. New registers they wernt here when you were so by seniority that makes you superior. I have met people like that. They usually wont help other users (definately not newbies) and look at themselves as privlidged for &quot;being there first&quot; although they are just another one of the masses. Its easy to call others behaviors obnoxious when you have no investment in the object that is at risk. I would like to see (although I can predict) how you would behave if the situation was different. If you had a large amount of BTC or maybe someone elses tied up. Maybe you can afford to juggle the money around but not everyone can. Im not saying everyones reactions were sensible but there is a justifiable reason to be worried and for that and combined with their different characters and the variables of their addiction as well as their financial state--I understand as I think DPR does. Thus the reason he has handled this professionaly and not got caught up in the commotion. Everyone understands the risk and I dont think there is anyone who doesnt thank DPR and everyone else that contributes to what makes this all work (its not just DPR) but at the same time these people are also contributing to the community that is at the heart of this. They pay their fees and follow the rules. These people make the system possible and in that respect and in this particular case forgiveness and understanding should be at the top of everyones list right now. Then there is the other foot that you can try my shoe on: im a SR member who split with their significant other. I need to start an account of my own now. I have been waiting just like you. Should I be &quot;halted&quot; from registering a new account? What if it was you that just found SR like some of the new registers have. You remember how excited you were to see it? Well you cant join because your new. Hopefully you can understand where im coming from and you take this the right way. Try not to have a &quot;spazathon&quot; over it. ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well for the time being the site has obvs been struggling so the obvious thing would be to do would be halt new users. Dpr has already commented on the &#039; explosive growth&#039;<br />I dont think at the moment SR will lose any buisness.<br />It was mostly newbies who flipped out but thats my opinion.<br /><br />Ive only just started as a vendor. after a week of it working out, it was down for a week so yes i can clearly see new ppl registering needs to be halted. I was also a buyer from near the start of SR so i can see how the issue has come about. Im thinking about all the decent vendors and buyers and future registrations. I would rather DPR took time to improve the site instead of allowing new accounts and crashing the site again. You will find the longer serving members didnt panic withdraw BTC&#039;s. Im not superior i just want the site to work. I understand there are decent sensible ppl who want to register an account. Im not saying they cant because they are new, im saying not having anyone new register is the sensible thing to do as the site cant handle it right. and a lot of the newbs comments on here arent going to help to persuade DPR to change his mind anytime soon.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is what im talking about.

The mods and DPR&#039;S writing style changed again to basically nothing but shit. Saying stuff like &quot;Our beloved DPR will be on in 12hrs to address the situation&quot; yet we appreciate the guy, the real DPR of old, but mods don&#039;t write that way and as for DPR&#039;s posts, they look more like a point form memo to a secretary to type up... any surprises there?<br /><br />Those of us who have been around for a while know THE ORIGINAL DPR&#039;s an awesome guy, who likes to hang out in the forums and always ran a &quot;tight ship&quot; but since he sold the boat, (for way more than it will prove to be worth because the new LEO team who intercepted it soon after can&#039;t manage it properly being &quot;white hats&quot; most fresh out of their five year college courses, don&#039;t know WTF they&#039;re doing with criminal minds systems) he&#039;s a happy man who&#039;s sailed off into the sunset. <br /><br />The team that took over gave it a pleasant new look, I&#039;ll give them that, but they weren&#039;t as tech savvy as THE DPR who oversaw everything, the system&#039;s security was shattered, (fucking spam bots could get in FFS) and people honestly think the NSA can&#039;t? LMFAO!<br /><br />The reason they put shit up not working properly is to quell suspicions but also because the LEO IT guys had to almost reverse engineer the system to figure it out, as well as re-activate well known vendors who have been absent for months OFFICIALLY, in order to get some people buying off them again to start tracking and tracing things and infiltrating some syndicates, even though to the trained eye the prices and accounts aren&#039;t the same people, almost like a BMR knock off.<br /><br />This new Govt support also explains the new blistering speed it&#039;s going at because after all, running off Pentagon supercomputers/servers it&#039;s going to be much quicker. <br /><br />Every time you place an order your details BTC, address and name etc as well as what you&#039;ve got will be recorded in their new automated system they would have put in there, and six to twelve months from now, Silk Road will make Farmers Market look like a street corner dime bag bust, as well as this they will have siphoned off and kept all BTC&#039;s they deem unnecessary to the operation and so at the end of all this shit they can say look how much we made for you the people from the &quot;bad guys&quot; and you can all rest easier now.<br /><br />Silk Road makes between 20 and 30 million a year in sales, the illicit drug war earns over 400Billion, yet busting SR will look better to them than killing Bin Laden, Pablo Escobar and the Ramirez Brothers all at once, even though there&#039;s more value in drugs sitting in one little favela in Peru than everything SR has to offer!<br /><br />I LOVED THIS PLACE AT THE START, NOW IT&#039;S ABOUT DRUGO&#039;S AND MONEY AND INSTEAD OF A FUNFAIR FEELS LIKE AN ARAB BAZAAR, NOT LOVE, LIBERTARIANISM FREE TRADE AND MUTUAL RESPECT... ESPECIALLY FROM THE SR &quot;SUPPORT TEAM&quot;, A FUCKING MISNOMER IF I&#039;VE HEARD ONE!!!<br /><br />It&#039;s hard for people who&#039;ve joined in the last 6-9 months to understand what we mean by how much it&#039;s changed and it&#039;s not the same place, but they&#039;ll learn, especially when LEO kicks in their doors to ruin their lives over some smack and a couple of grams of cocaine.<br /><br />C&#039;est la vi!<br /><br />Be smart folks, and use PGP to send your details NOT the SR checkout system, if you have to use it at all.

				jesuswasajerk-<br />I didnt realize we were being graded on punctuation and grammar. This is a forum filled with alot more obvious examples of ignorance as well as alot of broken English and alot more grammar and punctuation errors then I made. Are you right there telling them the same thing? Policing the forums for correct punctuation and grammar thats your job. Because I have an opinion and I am detailed im insulted? Did I say anything that would be an insult to anyone including yourself? Have I attacked anyone like I have been? Where was I such a horrible person that I deserve to be insulted? Did you even bother to read what I wrote? If its just that you cant understand the words are too big I can simplify it for you. I have to say im apalled at this point. I have had to start up new accounts here and over at BMR and every response I have recieved on this forum has been unfriendly and attacking. Over at BMR I havent been spoken to like this once. I had never been treated like this here before the site went down and I wasnt a &quot;newbie&quot;. I think some of you need a reality check here. Pretty sad the way some of you act so superior and better then everyone else. I know this isnt everyone and really consists of a just a handful of morons. This kind of business only comes back on itself. These things come out in the wash and if you are trying to keep people out of SR and kick everyone else out you can well then Jesus (ha talk about one STUPID name! How full of yourself are you?-Im shocked you would even mention mine) you must really think your are the son of God and that you can run SR as its only member or maybe just a small group of you and your &quot;friends&quot;&nbsp; can have it and meanwhile other sites will pop up (and are popping up as I type). That would be better for you wouldnt it? So now you can stop hitting refresh waiting for my reply like a dog. You can reply with more of your petty uneducated comments all you want. The GREAT thing about this place is I dont have to come back to this forum and I can still join when registration opens. On top of all that those of you that feel since you are a member so no one else should get in its not going to happen. Nothing can and nothing will change. DPR is running this game not a handful of people/kids that have nothing but time to camp out in forums all day posting comments making threads and blogs and polls and whatever else you time wasters do. All you want is a good ass kissing a day for writing in these forums and getting your posting count up. Dont say no because I know your kind. You dont go outside you live here. So say something smart for your &quot;friends&quot; and think you got me they will all kiss your ass good but really they know it and you know it. Cant lie to everyone the proof is evident. If I dont see your reply or any other comments from your shitmouth in this forum for that matter I dont think my life will be affected. Since you are so worried about punctuation and grammar even though you cant read go ahead and edit my posting. Someone will tell you &quot;good boy!&quot; +1 and you can do a spin on your fat ass in your computer chair. Something just occured to me. If I was a vendor I wouldnt go around pissing people off in forums. That could be bad for future business. Other members see it and act accordingly. Not just that but in this business you dont piss off addicts they are horribly vengeful. Well your lucky im not like that and im lucky im not a vendor but that is something for everyone to consider if your a vendor. Think about it all the problems it could cause. Well I dont want to piss off any vendors I might want to use so this is my last novel and my last visit to SR forums. Never needed them before anyway.

If even more people are trying to get on isnt that a good thing? Do we (you) not want anymore users in SR or is it full? So the vendors that are there can have the existing buyers only. As time goes on and vendors fade away does DPR open it up to just new vendors? As well as you are restricting vendors to the existing members only. Where will new registers go? Thats where the vendors will follow to and SR will lose out on all of that business. When you say &quot;a way to block all these morons&quot; I assume you are refering to all the current members who flipped out while SR was down? Both vendors and buyers. As well as you must be refering to the existing members that are trying to scam for BTCs. Has nothing to do with new registers. I think the bottom line is you have an account and its working and thats all you are thinking about. Also if you consider the site going down and having its members freaking out about being ripped off is limelight I question your thinking all together. If anything it made members pull their BTCs out and others steer clear but thats what you would have anyway. New registers they wernt here when you were so by seniority that makes you superior. I have met people like that. They usually wont help other users (definately not newbies) and look at themselves as privlidged for &quot;being there first&quot; although they are just another one of the masses. Its easy to call others behaviors obnoxious when you have no investment in the object that is at risk. I would like to see (although I can predict) how you would behave if the situation was different. If you had a large amount of BTC or maybe someone elses tied up. Maybe you can afford to juggle the money around but not everyone can. Im not saying everyones reactions were sensible but there is a justifiable reason to be worried and for that and combined with their different characters and the variables of their addiction as well as their financial state--I understand as I think DPR does. Thus the reason he has handled this professionaly and not got caught up in the commotion. Everyone understands the risk and I dont think there is anyone who doesnt thank DPR and everyone else that contributes to what makes this all work (its not just DPR) but at the same time these people are also contributing to the community that is at the heart of this. They pay their fees and follow the rules. These people make the system possible and in that respect and in this particular case forgiveness and understanding should be at the top of everyones list right now. Then there is the other foot that you can try my shoe on: im a SR member who split with their significant other. I need to start an account of my own now. I have been waiting just like you. Should I be &quot;halted&quot; from registering a new account? What if it was you that just found SR like some of the new registers have. You remember how excited you were to see it? Well you cant join because your new. Hopefully you can understand where im coming from and you take this the right way. Try not to have a &quot;spazathon&quot; over it. ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well for the time being the site has obvs been struggling so the obvious thing would be to do would be halt new users. Dpr has already commented on the &#039; explosive growth&#039;<br />I dont think at the moment SR will lose any buisness.<br />It was mostly newbies who flipped out but thats my opinion.<br /><br />Ive only just started as a vendor. after a week of it working out, it was down for a week so yes i can clearly see new ppl registering needs to be halted. I was also a buyer from near the start of SR so i can see how the issue has come about. Im thinking about all the decent vendors and buyers and future registrations. I would rather DPR took time to improve the site instead of allowing new accounts and crashing the site again. You will find the longer serving members didnt panic withdraw BTC&#039;s. Im not superior i just want the site to work. I understand there are decent sensible ppl who want to register an account. Im not saying they cant because they are new, im saying not having anyone new register is the sensible thing to do as the site cant handle it right. and a lot of the newbs comments on here arent going to help to persuade DPR to change his mind anytime soon.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is what im talking about. I agree with you in your clearified statement. I understand both sides but your original post came off in a different way or thats how I took it. I always sa&#039;y the problem with textsemails is there is no tone of voice. people shorten their thoughts and misunderstandings happen. Thanks for your professional response. I take back the points in which I thought you were presenting yourself as superior. ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is not a rant or dig at you two i just thought it was relevant to the conversation<br /><br />From all the retarded comments Ive been reading on this thread it seems that the ones who talk the most bollocks already have SR accounts, they are just new to the forum. I think its not so much about the quantity of customers but the quality of customers. There&#039;s been way too many ranting and raving because they might loose a couple of hundred quid. Boo hoo, these are the people who need to be ejected as they obviously have no idea about the drug trade. Id like to see them bitch and moan if they done a deal down a back alley and got a gun in their face and ripped off at the same time. Would they shout &quot;well i don&#039;t get treated like this in my local supermarket!&quot; The mugger would probably then shoot them for being so stupid. At least they don&#039;t have that fear here thats why they rant and moan and show themselves to be true morons. This is an illicit trade and sometimes shit happens. DON&#039;T TREAT IT LIKE AMAZON!!! SR could be gone at anytime and its forum,then where you gonna go to cry? If you don&#039;t have it to loose don&#039;t leave it lying around in your SR wallet for convenience ! deposit only when your buying that way if it was to vanish you at least have cut down the damage to you. Maybe a trusted invite system is whats required so only existing members can induct new members rather than just any tom dick or harry getting access. That way at least their is some way of vetting new members and ensuring they are up to speed with the drug trade. Geeze i don&#039;t believe Ive had to state the obvious. Some people if they had brains they would be deadly.<br /><br />Again lads this wasn&#039;t aimed at you but the &#039;community&#039; or lack there of as a whole. Peace and love x<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Some thoughts on what you said-not aimed at attacking you or anything. The people that have been making the most noise arent just new users to the forum. Its not a matter of how long you have been using the forums that determines behaviors especially when we could be talking about addicts. I just think some people reacted diffferently then others and depending on the feedback they recieved it could go one way or the other. Based on what I saw many other members didnt help the situation with their comments. Alot of people dont want to be told they are wrong for fearing their money is gone. They also dont want to be told that this is like a back alley dealer when before this the key focus has been on building a community that runs on trust. Speaking of the the back alley senerio isnt that why we are here anyway? To avoid that sort of situation. To act more as professionals. As far as the quality of the the members goes there will never be a way to get rid of scammers completely. The nature of the business and the online world makes it near impossible to run something like this without having troublemakers. Look at eBay no matter what they implement scammers get in and scam. The quality of user ranges on eBay just like it does here. Again I dont think limiting members will fix this. Membership fees might help weed out some but having invites by current members only means that the current members that are scammers can invite their scammer friends. Members will start selling accounts (like I have been offered) and then your right back where you started Its hard to have a site where you need to protect your identity but be able to verify members are not scammers. Even legit vendors turn into scammers sometimes so you cant be sure about anyone. Think about it.You say not to treat this like Amazon but why not? That is what we all would prefer isnt it? A site that is easy to use and you can buy what you want. Lots of options and lots of content. Maybe some buyer protection? I think you might have meant dont expect it to work like Amazon meaning there are scammers? Because there are scammers on Amazon too. I get the general point that SR is an underground operation and you cant expect it to have the same policys/behaviors that Amazon has but it could run with the same efficentcy (spelling?). The drug trade and back alley dealers are two different types of entities. In truth a professional in the drug trade runs things like a business and has many of the same practices that we use on SR. Where as a back alley dealer is someone who is usually an addict themselves who sells to support their own habit and that means your going to get screwed around. Many of us have been at this for MANY years working and suffering our way through these people to get to the professionals. We remember the back alley dealers though and that could be partially why some members flipped out. People have become acustomed to trusting SR not just their favorite vendors and when it looked like they wernt getting the response they wanted out of DPR it brought up old feelings of those past back alley dealers (B.A.D) not responding and robbing them. It makes a person feel like a fool when they get taken. Being experienced in this lifestyle makes you then kick yourself for thinking anything was different and you should have known better- until SR came back up. Then they realized they put their foot in their mouth. I have experienced this with my local vendors as well as in other situations in life where I jumped the gun and in those cases you have to be humble and just apologize and learn from the situation. True professionals will usually let it go--well I guess that depends on how bad you flip out and what you say/do. I think people understand its an illicit trade but that doesnt make it any better if you get ripped off. There are chances of bad things happening and people take them but its only human nature to complain or warn others to communicate the frustration/anger. If it did turn out that DPR split with the BTC would they have been morons then? Not just that but I think this is typical of a situation like this. A bunch of people get robbed-at first no one says anything because they think its just late. Then a few start to talk and gather information and worry. Then it starts one by one each person gives up on anything coming through at some point until everyone is talking about it and is in agreement. There are people like me that even though everyone has been ripped off and its clear I will still hold out doing anything besides talking about it until long after I should have. I wont jump the gun--learned from past mistakes. So everyone is different and I dont think anyone was wrong for worrying/being angry. Yes some of the comments were overboard but like I said everyone is different. SR could be gone at anytime its true but there are and will be others. Alot of people bad talk other sites (BMR) and wont accept anything other then SR in this business but alot more people including vendors use both sites. Where did alot of people go in the downtime do you think? I dont believe everyone just sat there or just used the forums to order. If you dont have local access and your connection is down what are you going to do? What do people do locally? Call someone you dont normally go see. Is that a lack of loyalty to your dealer? No its just business. With all the choices you have in your town to eat do you just visit the one? No you go where you are treated right where the food/prices are good and where it is convienient for you. You may have a favorite but that doesnt mean you wont go anywhere else. This is what would happen if SR was gone more sites would pop up and people would migrate over. So I agree people need to apreciate SR for the wonder that it is but to treat it as if it is the last of a dying breed is backwards.&nbsp; There are people with the mindset that it takes them the buyers/vendors to make the business a business. Alot of people dont look at it like they are fortunate to be there but that SR is fortunate to have them. Not that I think that is the correct way of viewing things but others do. Also alot of these people didnt have BTC just sitting in their accounts. Not everyone just deposits BTC only when they need a quick buy. Some have BTC going back and forth all the time. Maybe they did just deposit it like you suggest but the site went down or others that made purchases but the vendors couldnt see or do anything so they did what you suggest but the timing was bad. thats just the buyers. Vendors that were waiting for escrow to release for purcahses shipped and the purchaes that are new orders that are waiting to be shipped-do they ship them? So alot of different situations could be the motivating force behind the (now I am using your word:) &quot;spazathon&quot; that took place here. All Im really saying is I think everyone needs to cut everyone a break. Those that flipped and those that didnt. You can understand someones motivations without condoning them. I dont think it is a matter of new/old members not understanding the drug trade either I agree that maybe some sort of tutorial could be written that would address what to do in the event of another &quot;spazathon&quot; (theres that word again!) sort of an in case of emergency guide. You wouldnt want me to write it. My forum postings are novels. Im sorry but its how I talk and how I write. I cant be brief no matter how I try. I read someone say that DPR will regain his credit in time after this is all over but I see it differently. The site went down and with people flipping out and all the stress that guy must have if there was going to be an oppourtunity and a reason (Its hard to fix, feds, scammers,etc) to split with everyones BTC this would have been it. Instead the guy breaks his ass getting it back up he avoids the shit flinging in here and he produces a near-finished site that sounds like it is running better and he is still at work. I know customer support was lacking in some areas but considering the amount of people that tried to contact them I can understand why that might be a factor. I imagine that as time goes by he will find ways to improve on that as well. This was most definately a learning experience for DPR as well as for us the members. I dont know if it will even happen again once the dust settles on this but if it does everyone will behave differently as well as DPR I think.&nbsp; A positive thing has come out of this in my opinion and some will see it this way and some wont but I give MORE credit/trust to DPR now. His dedication and intentions seem clear to me if only for the time being although I dont think a time will come when his intentions change. These type of guys are in it to the end whatever that may be. This is his baby and he loves it. Makes me feel alot more confidence in SR. Wrote a novel here soaponarope but im just in a discussion with you not an arguement. :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I need someone to type my essay up you&#039;ve got the job&nbsp; ;)

				I got to the second sentence and couldn&#039;t be bothered trying to hurt my eyes keeping track of what line I&#039;m reading. Seriously dude, have some etiquette because like old mate said, nobodies going to read it bud... for the record! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70747.msg598980#msg598980">Quote from: dopey on November 16, 2012, 05:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">jesuswasajerk-<br />I didnt realize we were being graded on punctuation and grammar. This is a forum filled with alot more obvious examples of ignorance as well as alot of broken English and alot more grammar and punctuation errors then I made. Are you right there telling them the same thing? Policing the forums for correct punctuation and grammar thats your job. Because I have an opinion and I am detailed im insulted? Did I say anything that would be an insult to anyone including yourself? Have I attacked anyone like I have been? Where was I such a horrible person that I deserve to be insulted? Did you even bother to read what I wrote? If its just that you cant understand the words are too big I can simplify it for you. I have to say im apalled at this point. I have had to start up new accounts here and over at BMR and every response I have recieved on this forum has been unfriendly and attacking. Over at BMR I havent been spoken to like this once. I had never been treated like this here before the site went down and I wasnt a &quot;newbie&quot;. I think some of you need a reality check here. Pretty sad the way some of you act so superior and better then everyone else. I know this isnt everyone and really consists of a just a handful of morons. This kind of business only comes back on itself. These things come out in the wash and if you are trying to keep people out of SR and kick everyone else out you can well then Jesus (ha talk about one STUPID name! How full of yourself are you?-Im shocked you would even mention mine) you must really think your are the son of God and that you can run SR as its only member or maybe just a small group of you and your &quot;friends&quot;&nbsp; can have it and meanwhile other sites will pop up (and are popping up as I type). That would be better for you wouldnt it? So now you can stop hitting refresh waiting for my reply like a dog. You can reply with more of your petty uneducated comments all you want. The GREAT thing about this place is I dont have to come back to this forum and I can still join when registration opens. On top of all that those of you that feel since you are a member so no one else should get in its not going to happen. Nothing can and nothing will change. DPR is running this game not a handful of people/kids that have nothing but time to camp out in forums all day posting comments making threads and blogs and polls and whatever else you time wasters do. All you want is a good ass kissing a day for writing in these forums and getting your posting count up. Dont say no because I know your kind. You dont go outside you live here. So say something smart for your &quot;friends&quot; and think you got me they will all kiss your ass good but really they know it and you know it. Cant lie to everyone the proof is evident. If I dont see your reply or any other comments from your shitmouth in this forum for that matter I dont think my life will be affected. Since you are so worried about punctuation and grammar even though you cant read go ahead and edit my posting. Someone will tell you &quot;good boy!&quot; +1 and you can do a spin on your fat ass in your computer chair. Something just occured to me. If I was a vendor I wouldnt go around pissing people off in forums. That could be bad for future business. Other members see it and act accordingly. Not just that but in this business you dont piss off addicts they are horribly vengeful. Well your lucky im not like that and im lucky im not a vendor but that is something for everyone to consider if your a vendor. Think about it all the problems it could cause. Well I dont want to piss off any vendors I might want to use so this is my last novel and my last visit to SR forums. Never needed them before anyway.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thank you DPR and Team for all your hard work. <br /><br />I know it&#039;s a bastard when you&#039;re expecting free time and then have to deal with issues like these under continuous pressure. I hope you get the r&amp;r you need and deserve after all this.<br /><br />Thanks also to the rock solid Vendors who were patient throughout, kept their customers informed, and felt no need to participate in the spazathon. (And thanks Nomad Bloodbath for the terminology).<br /><br />My experiences of SR in the last 24 hours:<br />- Made a bitcoin deposit, coins landed within one hour.<br />- Exchanged messages with a vendor.<br />- Placed an order with said vendor.<br />- Still getting occasional logouts, but can work around for now.<br />- Otherwise, mostly finding the site to be at least as fast as before (and at the time of writing, very fast indeed).<br /><br />You&#039;ve all done a great job, and I for one will do my duty and continue to buy :-)<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />~ sm<br /><br />P.S. Nearly forgot, Ya Boo Sucks to the various incarnations of IHN and TOTBs and cohorts. You did not help.<br />

You guys have no idea, you act like I&#039;m saying this to be a cunt, when it&#039;s the fucking opposite you idiots there&#039;s people who know shit you don&#039;t and you guys don&#039;t think of it from all angles. WTF do you think I haven&#039;t been banned as you would love so much?<br /><br />You&#039;re like Creationists arguing with an Evolutionist! I&#039;m saying look at the facts and the bigger picture of things, as others have, and you&#039;re just going along with &quot;God&#039;s Word&quot; like it&#039;s gospel, and we all know the fucking bibles a myth of it&#039;s infallibility. For the hundredth time, I LOVE SILK ROAD, the REAL SILK ROAD I know without suspect shit and lies, dodgy support, zero addresses. Get off the meth and have a cone or two and really contemplate what&#039;s going on here. I WOULD LOVE TO BE WRONG, AND I HOPE I AM, I&#039;m just saying to people be fucking careful. It&#039;s obvious if run of the mill hackers and spammers can break into the system, there&#039;s nothing stopping the NSA.<br /><br />I read the book by the team who took out Pablo Escobar, and in the 80&#039;s they had a plane that could fly over Medellin, switch his phone on without him knowing and triangulate the position and switch it back off again. In the end they caught him in this manner over 20 years ago.<br /><br />Imagine what they would have now, in a network they built?<br /><br />You people to me seem a little bit relaxed about your lives and freedoms and I&#039;m being more concerned for you than you are!<br /><br />Remember it came out DPR sold the road in August I think it was, two weeks later they had that big upgrade but were obviously competent with the system and knew it in and out.<br /><br />This time it&#039;s completely different. We remember the OLD DPR, that was who we trusted and it was earned trust, now the DPR thing as far as an almost brand quality thing can&#039;t be applied to someone who&#039;s done nothing even close to DPR himself and therefore SR isn&#039;t the same because DPR WAS SR, and for all we know it could be a gang of people now running it employing outside IT workers to monitor it who don&#039;t get it quite yet OR the other gang or gangs, fucking governments of some sort. LEO is my gut feeling because a group interested in keeping the DPR quality up wouldn&#039;t be treating people the way they are, and it&#039;s not just me.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking you to take your drug hat off for a minute and put on your rationality one and think long and hard about the shit from all angles.<br /><br />If you had a consiglierie&nbsp; and he didn&#039;t give you impartial advice like this he wouldn&#039;t be doing his job, and I&#039;m actually trying to be a fucking helpful member of the &quot;community&quot; or what&#039;s left of it I&#039;m not here to have troll battles!<br /><br />Rational debates and discussion are what adults have, unless they&#039;re religious people, insults are for people with nothing constructive to say!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quote from a well known vendor on another forum... yes there&#039;s more SR ones than this!<br /><br />“Users of the site worship him.”..this is blatantly false. There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpol&#039;s World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian Assange revealed how much info governments share, freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking solar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison? SR had to be compromised sometime IMO!<br /><br />I HOPE I&#039;M WRONG, I REALLY DO BUT THE SR WE USED TO KNOW WOULDN&#039;T BE WITH HOLDING $2100 of someone&#039;s money after contacting them almost instantly then when provided evidence disappear and yet they were still online sending similar messages to other people. I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br />

There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpol&#039;s World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian Assange revealed how much info governments share, freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking solar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison?

I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Why are you still on the forums and why are you still going on about your 150BTC?

LEO is my gut feeling because a group interested in keeping the DPR quality up wouldn&#039;t be treating people the way they are, and it&#039;s not just me.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking you to take your drug hat off for a minute and put on your rationality one and think long and hard about the shit from all angles.<br /><br />If you had a consiglierie&nbsp; and he didn&#039;t give you impartial advice like this he wouldn&#039;t be doing his job, and I&#039;m actually trying to be a fucking helpful member of the &quot;community&quot; or what&#039;s left of it I&#039;m not here to have troll battles!<br /><br />Rational debates and discussion are what adults have, unless they&#039;re religious people, insults are for people with nothing constructive to say!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quote from a well known vendor on another forum... yes there&#039;s more SR ones than this!<br /><br />“Users of the site worship him.”..this is blatantly false. There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpol&#039;s World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian Assange revealed how much info governments share, freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking solar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison? SR had to be compromised sometime IMO!<br /><br />I HOPE I&#039;M WRONG, I REALLY DO BUT THE SR WE USED TO KNOW WOULDN&#039;T BE WITH HOLDING $2100 of someone&#039;s money after contacting them almost instantly then when provided evidence disappear and yet they were still online sending similar messages to other people. I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Why are you still on the forums and why are you still going on about your 150BTC?

You make me chuckle.<br /><br />You seem to be assuming im american and called me &#039;trailer park&#039; so now your offending americans now, well done for that

not trying to question this vendor, i could have easily missed seeing before, but i think i would have remember a vendor w/so many colorful pics. please advise if this is unfounded, and apology to TF if so.<br /><br />&nbsp; just my wondering, please reply with thoughts. crazy hate reply not needed, wont be read. thank you to others smart enough to know only one to depend on watching u ass is u.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I started a thread two days ago and there were no mods or anything and today about half an hour after posting this my thread was deleted and there was a new statement from &quot;DPR&quot; regarding the site etc.<br />I have been in discussion with one of the MOD&#039;s on here who said he&#039;d been in discussion with DPR daily and is a really good bloke IMO and has calmed my nerves a bit however I&#039;m still locked out of my account and I&#039;m also still out of pocket 150BTC that was never processed into my account although it shows clearly in the block chain then was slowly taken out in strange increments.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I posted...<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I posted on my thread about half an hour before it was deleted and this magical &quot;DPR&quot; post came along to counter it.<br /><br />Personally I think they saw us old hats pointing out too many things they didn&#039;t like, so I&#039;ll do it again and I SERIOUSLY suggest you and others read the whole thing as I know some people have attention spans of as long as it takes to read a TV timetable but it&#039;s important information people MUST consider in this place.<br /><br />from last nights thread that I didn&#039;t post before I fell asleep...<br /><br />You all say this while I&#039;ve been away having a private chat with a MAJOR VENDOR and he&#039;s worried about whether to pull his coins or if he&#039;ll even get them, or if he should just try one first and see how long that takes.

I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Why are you still on the forums and why are you still going on about your 150BTC?

I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Why are you still on the forums and why are you still going on about your 150BTC?

not trying to question this vendor, i could have easily missed seeing before, but i think i would have remember a vendor w/so many colorful pics. please advise if this is unfounded, and apology to TF if so.<br /><br />&nbsp; just my wondering, please reply with thoughts. crazy hate reply not needed, wont be read. thank you to others smart enough to know only one to depend on watching u ass is u.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I started a thread two days ago and there were no mods or anything and today about half an hour after posting this my thread was deleted and there was a new statement from &quot;DPR&quot; regarding the site etc.<br />I have been in discussion with one of the MOD&#039;s on here who said he&#039;d been in discussion with DPR daily and is a really good bloke IMO and has calmed my nerves a bit however I&#039;m still locked out of my account and I&#039;m also still out of pocket 150BTC that was never processed into my account although it shows clearly in the block chain then was slowly taken out in strange increments.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I posted...<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I posted on my thread about half an hour before it was deleted and this magical &quot;DPR&quot; post came along to counter it.<br /><br />Personally I think they saw us old hats pointing out too many things they didn&#039;t like, so I&#039;ll do it again and I SERIOUSLY suggest you and others read the whole thing as I know some people have attention spans of as long as it takes to read a TV timetable but it&#039;s important information people MUST consider in this place.<br /><br />from last nights thread that I didn&#039;t post before I fell asleep...<br /><br />You all say this while I&#039;ve been away having a private chat with a MAJOR VENDOR and he&#039;s worried about whether to pull his coins or if he&#039;ll even get them, or if he should just try one first and see how long that takes. You guys have no idea, you act like I&#039;m saying this to be a cunt, when it&#039;s the fucking opposite you idiots there&#039;s people who know shit you don&#039;t and you guys don&#039;t think of it from all angles. WTF do you think I haven&#039;t been banned as you would love so much?<br /><br />You&#039;re like Creationists arguing with an Evolutionist! I&#039;m saying look at the facts and the bigger picture of things, as others have, and you&#039;re just going along with &quot;God&#039;s Word&quot; like it&#039;s gospel, and we all know the fucking bibles a myth of it&#039;s infallibility. For the hundredth time, I LOVE SILK ROAD, the REAL SILK ROAD I know without suspect shit and lies, dodgy support, zero addresses. Get off the meth and have a cone or two and really contemplate what&#039;s going on here. I WOULD LOVE TO BE WRONG, AND I HOPE I AM, I&#039;m just saying to people be fucking careful. It&#039;s obvious if run of the mill hackers and spammers can break into the system, there&#039;s nothing stopping the NSA.<br /><br />I read the book by the team who took out Pablo Escobar, and in the 80&#039;s they had a plane that could fly over Medellin, switch his phone on without him knowing and triangulate the position and switch it back off again. In the end they caught him in this manner over 20 years ago.<br /><br />Imagine what they would have now, in a network they built?<br /><br />You people to me seem a little bit relaxed about your lives and freedoms and I&#039;m being more concerned for you than you are!<br /><br />Remember it came out DPR sold the road in August I think it was, two weeks later they had that big upgrade but were obviously competent with the system and knew it in and out.<br /><br />This time it&#039;s completely different. We remember the OLD DPR, that was who we trusted and it was earned trust, now the DPR thing as far as an almost brand quality thing can&#039;t be applied to someone who&#039;s done nothing even close to DPR himself and therefore SR isn&#039;t the same because DPR WAS SR, and for all we know it could be a gang of people now running it employing outside IT workers to monitor it who don&#039;t get it quite yet OR the other gang or gangs, fucking governments of some sort. LEO is my gut feeling because a group interested in keeping the DPR quality up wouldn&#039;t be treating people the way they are, and it&#039;s not just me.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking you to take your drug hat off for a minute and put on your rationality one and think long and hard about the shit from all angles.<br /><br />If you had a consiglierie&nbsp; and he didn&#039;t give you impartial advice like this he wouldn&#039;t be doing his job, and I&#039;m actually trying to be a fucking helpful member of the &quot;community&quot; or what&#039;s left of it I&#039;m not here to have troll battles!<br /><br />Rational debates and discussion are what adults have, unless they&#039;re religious people, insults are for people with nothing constructive to say!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quote from a well known vendor on another forum... yes there&#039;s more SR ones than this!<br /><br />“Users of the site worship him.”..this is blatantly false. There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpol&#039;s World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian Assange revealed how much info governments share, freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking solar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison?

You guys have no idea, you act like I&#039;m saying this to be a cunt, when it&#039;s the fucking opposite you idiots there&#039;s people who know shit you don&#039;t and you guys don&#039;t think of it from all angles. WTF do you think I haven&#039;t been banned as you would love so much?<br /><br />You&#039;re like Creationists arguing with an Evolutionist! I&#039;m saying look at the facts and the bigger picture of things, as others have, and you&#039;re just going along with &quot;God&#039;s Word&quot; like it&#039;s gospel, and we all know the fucking bibles a myth of it&#039;s infallibility. For the hundredth time, I LOVE SILK ROAD, the REAL SILK ROAD I know without suspect shit and lies, dodgy support, zero addresses. Get off the meth and have a cone or two and really contemplate what&#039;s going on here. I WOULD LOVE TO BE WRONG, AND I HOPE I AM, I&#039;m just saying to people be fucking careful. It&#039;s obvious if run of the mill hackers and spammers can break into the system, there&#039;s nothing stopping the NSA.<br /><br />I read the book by the team who took out Pablo Escobar, and in the 80&#039;s they had a plane that could fly over Medellin, switch his phone on without him knowing and triangulate the position and switch it back off again. In the end they caught him in this manner over 20 years ago.<br /><br />Imagine what they would have now, in a network they built?<br /><br />You people to me seem a little bit relaxed about your lives and freedoms and I&#039;m being more concerned for you than you are!<br /><br />Remember it came out DPR sold the road in August I think it was, two weeks later they had that big upgrade but were obviously competent with the system and knew it in and out.<br /><br />This time it&#039;s completely different. We remember the OLD DPR, that was who we trusted and it was earned trust, now the DPR thing as far as an almost brand quality thing can&#039;t be applied to someone who&#039;s done nothing even close to DPR himself and therefore SR isn&#039;t the same because DPR WAS SR, and for all we know it could be a gang of people now running it employing outside IT workers to monitor it who don&#039;t get it quite yet OR the other gang or gangs, fucking governments of some sort. LEO is my gut feeling because a group interested in keeping the DPR quality up wouldn&#039;t be treating people the way they are, and it&#039;s not just me.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking you to take your drug hat off for a minute and put on your rationality one and think long and hard about the shit from all angles.<br /><br />If you had a consiglierie&nbsp; and he didn&#039;t give you impartial advice like this he wouldn&#039;t be doing his job, and I&#039;m actually trying to be a fucking helpful member of the &quot;community&quot; or what&#039;s left of it I&#039;m not here to have troll battles!<br /><br />Rational debates and discussion are what adults have, unless they&#039;re religious people, insults are for people with nothing constructive to say!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quote from a well known vendor on another forum... yes there&#039;s more SR ones than this!<br /><br />“Users of the site worship him.”..this is blatantly false. There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpol&#039;s World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian Assange revealed how much info governments share, freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking solar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison? SR had to be compromised sometime IMO!<br /><br />I HOPE I&#039;M WRONG, I REALLY DO BUT THE SR WE USED TO KNOW WOULDN&#039;T BE WITH HOLDING $2100 of someone&#039;s money after contacting them almost instantly then when provided evidence disappear and yet they were still online sending similar messages to other people. I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Why are you still on the forums and why are you still going on about your 150BTC?

If you did you would say, as others have, you&#039;ve raised some very valid points and I hope others read your post in full if only for the consideration.<br /><br />I don&#039;t need to spend my time trying to point out things to brain dead cunts like yourself, I did it so hopefully some people can not end up fucked over or in prison, it&#039;s called common courtesy, something your inbred incestuous parents didn&#039;t teach you in the trailer park you grew up in!<br /><br />Seriously, and I mean this with all sincerity, I hope you&#039;re the only one on here who does go down in flames and perhaps when you go to prison they&#039;ll force you to learn to use your brain because thinking is all you&#039;re going to have time to do, and you need practice... lots of it! <br /><br />So why don&#039;t you do yourself a favour and neck up you illiterate cunt you&#039;re a parrot!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Cant find your exact comment as theres too many of your abusive comments slagging off the DPR team to sift through. So i doubt your mates with one of the Admins. But you called them &#039;&#039;robbing c**ts&#039;&#039; so no, its not friendly.<br /><br />Everything you say is balanced and logical lol. You make me chuckle.<br /><br />You seem to be assuming im american and called me &#039;trailer park&#039; so now your offending americans now, well done for that<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				You are the single most annoying cunt on here next to spammers, stop talking to me I won&#039;t acknowledge your feeble attempts to incite me to anger, I&#039;ll simply say you are a mental midget with evidently a drug problem based on your Franky Wilde wannabe avatar and your pathetic ruses to try and trick me. Actually ass fucker, I&#039;ve been awake over 25hrs, with nothing except 15mg of diazepam and 60mg of oxycontin and a bunch of cones, so when people are over tired, they aren&#039;t as sharp as normal but dude, unlike you I have better things to do than troll peoples shit trying to pick out inconsistencies and shit.

You guys have no idea, you act like I&#039;m saying this to be a cunt, when it&#039;s the fucking opposite you idiots there&#039;s people who know shit you don&#039;t and you guys don&#039;t think of it from all angles. WTF do you think I haven&#039;t been banned as you would love so much?<br /><br />You&#039;re like Creationists arguing with an Evolutionist! I&#039;m saying look at the facts and the bigger picture of things, as others have, and you&#039;re just going along with &quot;God&#039;s Word&quot; like it&#039;s gospel, and we all know the fucking bibles a myth of it&#039;s infallibility. For the hundredth time, I LOVE SILK ROAD, the REAL SILK ROAD I know without suspect shit and lies, dodgy support, zero addresses. Get off the meth and have a cone or two and really contemplate what&#039;s going on here. I WOULD LOVE TO BE WRONG, AND I HOPE I AM, I&#039;m just saying to people be fucking careful. It&#039;s obvious if run of the mill hackers and spammers can break into the system, there&#039;s nothing stopping the NSA.<br /><br />I read the book by the team who took out Pablo Escobar, and in the 80&#039;s they had a plane that could fly over Medellin, switch his phone on without him knowing and triangulate the position and switch it back off again. In the end they caught him in this manner over 20 years ago.<br /><br />Imagine what they would have now, in a network they built?<br /><br />You people to me seem a little bit relaxed about your lives and freedoms and I&#039;m being more concerned for you than you are!<br /><br />Remember it came out DPR sold the road in August I think it was, two weeks later they had that big upgrade but were obviously competent with the system and knew it in and out.<br /><br />This time it&#039;s completely different. We remember the OLD DPR, that was who we trusted and it was earned trust, now the DPR thing as far as an almost brand quality thing can&#039;t be applied to someone who&#039;s done nothing even close to DPR himself and therefore SR isn&#039;t the same because DPR WAS SR, and for all we know it could be a gang of people now running it employing outside IT workers to monitor it who don&#039;t get it quite yet OR the other gang or gangs, fucking governments of some sort. LEO is my gut feeling because a group interested in keeping the DPR quality up wouldn&#039;t be treating people the way they are, and it&#039;s not just me.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking you to take your drug hat off for a minute and put on your rationality one and think long and hard about the shit from all angles.<br /><br />If you had a consiglierie&nbsp; and he didn&#039;t give you impartial advice like this he wouldn&#039;t be doing his job, and I&#039;m actually trying to be a fucking helpful member of the &quot;community&quot; or what&#039;s left of it I&#039;m not here to have troll battles!<br /><br />Rational debates and discussion are what adults have, unless they&#039;re religious people, insults are for people with nothing constructive to say!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quote from a well known vendor on another forum... yes there&#039;s more SR ones than this!<br /><br />“Users of the site worship him.”..this is blatantly false. There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpol&#039;s World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian Assange revealed how much info governments share, freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking solar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison? SR had to be compromised sometime IMO!<br /><br />I HOPE I&#039;M WRONG, I REALLY DO BUT THE SR WE USED TO KNOW WOULDN&#039;T BE WITH HOLDING $2100 of someone&#039;s money after contacting them almost instantly then when provided evidence disappear and yet they were still online sending similar messages to other people. I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Why are you still on the forums and why are you still going on about your 150BTC?

				The thing about recognizing writing patterns is actually a very legitimate concern, anyone with 1000+ posts should be very weary of it. Even if you think you alternate in the way you write there are certain things that can still be compared that you don&#039;t even think about. Virtually everything can be analyzed, things like average sentence length, average number of of commas, common word combinations, use of specific vocabulary, common misspellings, there are literally hundreds of things which you would never really think about. For most of us its not really a problem, even for DPR its not a problem unless he has like a very popular blog on the open internet with his real identity, perhaps about internet anonymity, or security or programming. Anything that could connect the identities together. Someone like Limitless however with a shitload of posts (I mean seriously, the guy needs to get a hobby or something) should be very careful. These programs are no joke and its quite frightening what they&#039;re capable of. The only limetation (pun intended) is finding something to compare the users on here to, I mean, you can&#039;t compare users on here with the whole internet. It&#039;s not like the US governments has some sort of super computer that could even do this, and even if they did its not like they don&#039;t have more important things to worry about than locking up people who aren&#039;t hurting anyone but themselves, oh wait.<br /><br />Still, be careful guys.

It&#039;s obnoxious. At best, you&#039;re doing yourself a disservice, as you&#039;re giving people a bad impression of yourself. Just act like every other vendor, post a single thread for your deals in the &#039;Offers&#039; section, and let your product and service speak for itself.

So even though they might just have 10 of them per store you get 100&#039;s of people waiting and thinking they are going to get that sales item (needless to sayy after they are gone in 5minutes, everyone kind of goes ape shit)<br /><br />It is the absolute worst day to go shopping if you are just doing regular shopping, because it gets pretty sketchy in most shops.<br /><br />Hope this helps, and sorry for the bad punctuation and grammar, I&#039;m still half alseep (thought it was much later when I woke up)<br />-AA</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

No that is not normal. It takes about 10-20 seconds for me for 1, but initial synchronisation took around 70 hours (not minutes) as there were over 100, 000 blocks to synchronise. Alternatively you can get pre-synchronised blockchains but these are not recommended unless your computer is downright epic. To avoid future lag times with your BTC wallet I&#039;d recommend connecting daily when it is fully done, as it has to be synchronised on a pretty much constant basis. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70747.msg598851#msg598851">Quote from: h1n1z2 on November 16, 2012, 04:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fuck me Dopey, any chance of a paragraph or two??<br /><br />No one is going to read that massive block of text<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I just peed a little.<br /><br /><br />

You guys have no idea, you act like I&#039;m saying this to be a cunt, when it&#039;s the fucking opposite you idiots there&#039;s people who know shit you don&#039;t and you guys don&#039;t think of it from all angles. WTF do you think I haven&#039;t been banned as you would love so much?<br /><br />You&#039;re like Creationists arguing with an Evolutionist! I&#039;m saying look at the facts and the bigger picture of things, as others have, and you&#039;re just going along with &quot;God&#039;s Word&quot; like it&#039;s gospel, and we all know the fucking bibles a myth of it&#039;s infallibility. For the hundredth time, I LOVE SILK ROAD, the REAL SILK ROAD I know without suspect shit and lies, dodgy support, zero addresses. Get off the meth and have a cone or two and really contemplate what&#039;s going on here. I WOULD LOVE TO BE WRONG, AND I HOPE I AM, I&#039;m just saying to people be fucking careful. It&#039;s obvious if run of the mill hackers and spammers can break into the system, there&#039;s nothing stopping the NSA.<br /><br />I read the book by the team who took out Pablo Escobar, and in the 80&#039;s they had a plane that could fly over Medellin, switch his phone on without him knowing and triangulate the position and switch it back off again. In the end they caught him in this manner over 20 years ago.<br /><br />Imagine what they would have now, in a network they built?<br /><br />You people to me seem a little bit relaxed about your lives and freedoms and I&#039;m being more concerned for you than you are!<br /><br />Remember it came out DPR sold the road in August I think it was, two weeks later they had that big upgrade but were obviously competent with the system and knew it in and out.<br /><br />This time it&#039;s completely different. We remember the OLD DPR, that was who we trusted and it was earned trust, now the DPR thing as far as an almost brand quality thing can&#039;t be applied to someone who&#039;s done nothing even close to DPR himself and therefore SR isn&#039;t the same because DPR WAS SR, and for all we know it could be a gang of people now running it employing outside IT workers to monitor it who don&#039;t get it quite yet OR the other gang or gangs, fucking governments of some sort. LEO is my gut feeling because a group interested in keeping the DPR quality up wouldn&#039;t be treating people the way they are, and it&#039;s not just me.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking you to take your drug hat off for a minute and put on your rationality one and think long and hard about the shit from all angles.<br /><br />If you had a consiglierie&nbsp; and he didn&#039;t give you impartial advice like this he wouldn&#039;t be doing his job, and I&#039;m actually trying to be a fucking helpful member of the &quot;community&quot; or what&#039;s left of it I&#039;m not here to have troll battles!<br /><br />Rational debates and discussion are what adults have, unless they&#039;re religious people, insults are for people with nothing constructive to say!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quote from a well known vendor on another forum... yes there&#039;s more SR ones than this!<br /><br />“Users of the site worship him.”..this is blatantly false. There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpol&#039;s World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian Assange revealed how much info governments share, freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking solar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison? SR had to be compromised sometime IMO!<br /><br />I HOPE I&#039;M WRONG, I REALLY DO BUT THE SR WE USED TO KNOW WOULDN&#039;T BE WITH HOLDING $2100 of someone&#039;s money after contacting them almost instantly then when provided evidence disappear and yet they were still online sending similar messages to other people. I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Why are you still on the forums and why are you still going on about your 150BTC?

CUNT!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Well you ment either one of the last 2 and im sure they dont appreciate being called that.<br />Especaily when you said you were messaging them trying to resolve the issue.<br />Your clearly just a troll and you should count yourself lucky you can even post on these forums<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Okay it&#039;s spelled MEANT and ESPECIALLY... your lack of literacy and punctuation skills aside, you don&#039;t know who the fuck I was talking to and for the record NO it wasn&#039;t microRNA and furthermore said MOD and I get along famously, and yes dickweed I called him a sick cunt and he knew exactly what I meant without having to expand on it.<br /><br />Why I&#039;m justifying myself to an doss cunt with the coke badger as his avatar who thinks it&#039;s a privilege to post on a public forum is beyond me, and in case you can&#039;t see that unlike what you say everything I say is balanced and logical and I&#039;m always quick to say that I HOPE I&#039;M WRONG and also you clearly didn&#039;t read what I wrote which doesn&#039;t surprise me being that you border on the edge of retarded. If you did you would say, as others have, you&#039;ve raised some very valid points and I hope others read your post in full if only for the consideration.<br /><br />I don&#039;t need to spend my time trying to point out things to brain dead cunts like yourself, I did it so hopefully some people can not end up fucked over or in prison, it&#039;s called common courtesy, something your inbred incestuous parents didn&#039;t teach you in the trailer park you grew up in!<br /><br />Seriously, and I mean this with all sincerity, I hope you&#039;re the only one on here who does go down in flames and perhaps when you go to prison they&#039;ll force you to learn to use your brain because thinking is all you&#039;re going to have time to do, and you need practice... lots of it! <br /><br />So why don&#039;t you do yourself a favour and neck up you illiterate cunt you&#039;re a parrot!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Cant find your exact comment as theres too many of your abusive comments slagging off the DPR team to sift through. So i doubt your mates with one of the Admins. But you called them &#039;&#039;robbing c**ts&#039;&#039; so no, its not friendly.<br /><br />Everything you say is balanced and logical lol. You make me chuckle.<br /><br />You seem to be assuming im american and called me &#039;trailer park&#039; so now your offending americans now, well done for that<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Glad that&#039;s finally over. Took me a long time to find what I was looking for in the first place as a result of that.

I mean it was started by the DPR team to keep us abreast of the &quot;Great outtage of November 2012&quot;, It&#039;s almost Christmas~! <br /><br />Hope you all have a good one, and realize we&#039;re all human. With amazing talents, as well as failings. Somehow, we all get together and it&#039;s still working! <br /><br />A few bruises and skinned knees along the way, but we&#039;re all here, getting it done!<br /><br />May I be the first to wish all on this thread a better and happier new year than 2012 was~! <br /><br />May I also request that someone from team DPR just delete this whole thread. It outlived it&#039;s usefulness a month ago!<br /><br />See some of you around. I&#039;m a regular on the Speed Amph review page. <br /><br />Good Luck to you all!<br /><br />jagfug<br /><br />I also promise to come up with a better quote for the new year. That Abe Lincoln one has pretty much been played more than the Human League&#039;s &quot;Don&#039;t You Want Me Baby&quot; was in 1982 !!!
