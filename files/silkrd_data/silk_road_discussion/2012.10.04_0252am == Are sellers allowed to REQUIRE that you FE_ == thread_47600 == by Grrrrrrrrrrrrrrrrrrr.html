This is mainly due to the fact that (believe it or not) alot of people try to scam vendors. Which ofcourse shoud not be the case, as trust goes a long way. Decide yourself, do research on the vendors - follow their feedback for some days, and than pick the one which is suited best for you. Also you might consider ordering domestic over int. Ofcourse in some cases that depends on your geo. location.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				If they have been a vendor over a month(or around that...maybe 2 or 3 but I am pretty sure a month) and have 35+ feed backs then they can ask you to or even require you to. You don&#039;t have to of course but they also do not have to vend to you.<br /><br />As there are over a thousand post on here NOT to FE...There are some rare instances and some vendors that you have to if you want to do business. <br /><br />There is usually always an alternate vendor you can deal with. <br /><br />I would suggest you should never finalize early.<br /><br />Good luck

				The vendor must have over 35 transactions before being able to ask you to FE.<br /><br />After the 35 though they can choose not to sell any other way other then FE if they want to.<br /><br /><br />It is totally up to them. Who YOU shop with though is totally up to YOU!<br />

				Im a new vendor on SR, I&#039;ve been here 23 days and have 23 transactions with 100% feedback. I don&#039;t wan FE nor would I ask for it, totally defeats the point in having Escrow in the first place.<br /><br />My question is that I have had quite a few buyers who have received their order from me but written to me to tell me they cannot release the funds from Escrow straight away. It seems to be 3-5 days after people receive their order before I get paid. <br /><br />Can amybody tell me if their is a certain amount of time a new seller must wait for Escrow release after finalizing. I&#039;ve asked vendor support but they didn&#039;t even reply. <br /><br />Cheers CZ

				If you are a new vendor (&lt;35 transactions) the finalise button becomes only available for your customers - i think - 3 days after you put the order in transit.

So after you confirm the item in transit they will then be able to finalize 48 hours after. Once you surpass 35 transactions they will be able to finalize right away.

				To FE or not to FE that is the qustion I ask.<br /><br />Anyone who says never FE is just a loser...<br /><br />FE is there for a case by case basis and as such cant just be discounted!<br /><br />I required someone to FE just the other week.. It was an order for over 200$ going out of the country via regular mail...<br /><br />You think I want to sit and wait for it to get there, or even worse it never gets there due to customs or loss! Then it goes to resolution after 17 days and gets extended an other 10 days.. to finally have to explain that I don&#039;t offer any guarantee on regular mail options...<br /><br />Forget that headache..... FE is useful on a case by case basis and should never be written off!<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Yeah I agree. I&#039;d like to think I&#039;d never FE, but I have on 2 occasions. In both cases they were trusted vendors with feedback from senior or hero members and that gave me enough confidence to FE. You have to think of things from the vendor&#039;s perspective. They get scammed too.<br /><br />Having said that, I&#039;ve got some fucking amazing buyer stats, so I tend not to be asked to FE. Anyone who spends as much as me on fucking drugs deserves some respect. If SR was a pub, I&#039;d be the pissed regular in the corner with a huge red hooter propping up the bar.

				I ended up doing FE because they&#039;re the best seller for what I ordered. I got it today, but have yet to try it out. So yeah... I guess it just depends on the reviews, like you guys said. The vendor has over 300 transactions so at that point it think it&#039;s safe. But of course - read the reviews!

A completely free market is an idealized form of a market economy where buyers and sellers are allowed to transact freely (i.e. buy/sell/trade) based on a mutual agreement on price without state intervention in the form of taxes, subsidies or regulation.<br /><br />Investopedia explains &#039;Free Market&#039;:<br />In simple terms, a free market is a summary term for an array of exchanges that take place in society. Each exchange is a voluntary agreement between two parties who trade in the form of goods and services. In reality, this is the extent to which a free market exists since there will always be government intervention in the form of taxes, price controls and restrictions that prevent new competitors from entering a market. Just like supply-side economics, free market is a term used to describe a political or ideological viewpoint on policy and is not a field within economics.&quot;<br /><br />The fact that there is NO &quot;government intervention in the form of taxes, price controls and restrictions that prevent new competitors from entering a market&quot; means that yes, this is the dictionary definition of a free market.<br /><br />I&#039;m not entirely sure where you studied economics but you should probably look into some way of getting refunded for the substandard schooling you received.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />[SNIP]<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I would say never FE for a vendor who has any hint of inconsistencies, such as late shipping time or &quot;lost&quot; packages. I rarely FE and it is usually the case that some discount is given, not to mention the fact that the vendor is very well established and prior business has been conducted within escrow. A good example is PuffBuddy. <br /><br />But in general, you always want to minimize your risk. FE increases your risk, so be cautious.
