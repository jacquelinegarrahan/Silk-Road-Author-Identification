They also do not realize how many packages are mailed every day. <br /><br />Also do you notice how 99% of the time it is always members that weed is there drug of choice. Or should I say the drug they were on/ ordering when they came up with there theory.<br /><br />I have read where members believe that certain things bring more scrutiny to packages and it is just totally insane to believe that. Packages going to and from USA have a 99.9999999% chance of going through. And if the package is just pills then it is as close to 100% as you can get to being delivered. There really is little to no risk ordering off SR. I guess people just want to believe and talk about bad things.

				Well, If you consider that SR its a black market, it will be always under constant attacks since calling the authority is out of the question. It is simply an easy target. However, this does not looks like a big deal as long as you do not send any money to any of those funny addresses. <br />&nbsp;

				Only times there is really issues are on Mondays!! And its probley their weekly time their work on the place and try to do it without interruption.In nov i made 6 purchases ,this month just since last week iv got over 7 come in from USA ,netherlands and waiting on from EU..I have had no issues at all.. Other then the every monday BS.. I do believe this place could be shutdown and figured out in due time, im not saying its untoucable forever but it doesnt seem like its been fully compromised other than by some so called hackers trying their best to fuck something up. If it was law Well they would im sure do investigation for a good while or eaither shut it down.. Not sure which.. But me being just a small time buying, fuck it.. My drugs come i take them within a few days and its done.. Im not saying to be to relax cause what were all involved with is highly Illegal and Is pissing alot of Gov officials off cause of are brazingness as they say. But for fucks sake drugs have been sold on the net for years just not with a System such as this one thats actual like a business instead of a fly by night and u snooz u loose type deal.. And to the OP why is it always a newbie who has hardly ever said anything who points these issues out? R u actually another Long time user just doesnt wanna use his real name?

The site has not been compromised and your theory is based on speculation alone. Mrouid is a very professional vendor and certainly knows what he is doing. What has happened for you to suggest &quot;your supply line from mrouid has come under surveilance&quot; or are you speculating on what might have happened? Your freedom is reliant on your ability to remain anonymous and the use of some COMMON SENSE. If your not able to so, then by all means head back to IRL sellers.

				*Grabs Popcorn*<br /><br />I almost enjoy SR going down occasionally just to see the kooks that come out of the woodwork.&nbsp; Of course once SR is up again they&#039;ll all disappear again.<br /><br />And typically they start new accounts because having 1 post because they&#039;re actually embarrassed of what they&#039;re saying, even as they&#039;re typing it.&nbsp; Whoop dee doo SQL injection attack, the site will come back like it always does.&nbsp; Those of us who have experienced this before have planned ahead and already have enough supply to last us a good month.

Until DRR makes a statement, lay off champ and give him/her a go. If not, go elsewhere and post your dribble.

I mean, even if it was the pigs running the site now, what could they really do?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The problem with your scenario is that, according to multiple vendors who have posted about this, somewhere between 75 and 90% of buyers do NOT use PGP to encrypt even their shipping address information. I have seen multiple threads where vendors have lamented this fact, and wondered aloud why it is that so many people simply refuse to do the right thing, and use PGP? <br /><br />Some vendors on here just refuse to use PGP, and insist that their customers use dodgy sites like Privnote.com. <br /><br />A few months back, there was a post by an Aussie gent (Winters86) who made some interesting claims: <br /><br />- They claimed they were from a family with several members who are high-ranking officials within Australian law enforcement. <br /><br />- They claimed to have seen a confidential report discussing potential strategies for combatting sites that vend drugs through the mail, and that use Bitcoin. Silk Road was specifically mentioned. <br /><br />- The two most salient points they made were as follows: <br /><br />&nbsp; 1. PGP is terrifying them, every new user who learns it and helps others learn, closes a possible loophole they where planning to exploit.<br /><br />&nbsp; 2. User ignorance of the technology being used (Tor, PGP etc) is the their single best hope for any kind of serious action against the SR community. <br /><br />&nbsp; Security / Australian LE Report on BC/SR<br />&nbsp; « on: August 26, 2012, 01:11 AM »<br />&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38319.msg431562#msg431562<br />&nbsp; <br />I would have thought that the publication of this information would have led DPR to change their stance on PGP -- I had hoped that they might see fit to make its use mandatory. Unfortunately, that was not to be. Many people appear to view PGP as a nuisance, instead of the superb security tool that it is. Without direction coming from the top, it would appear that widespread adoption is simply not going to happen. <br /><br />As much as it pains me to say this, DPR&#039;s attitude is actually aiding and abetting law enforcement. <br /><br />The long and the short of it is, that people who have used their heads, and followed best practices, have relatively little to fear. Unfortunately, those people appear to be only a tiny minority. <br /><br />Although the instructions when signing up for a Forum account are quite explicit --warning people not to use a real email address -- nevertheless thousands of people on the site _have_ used real, traceable clearnet email addresses. <br /><br />If the Forum membership database is ever hacked/breached, it&#039;s gonna be a literal bonanza for law enforcement. <br /><br />NC<br />

Things like heavy and excessive amounts of tape, handwritten labels, return address that doesn&#039;t exist, return address that doesn&#039;t match the region package was mailed from. The USPS has drug package profiles, you can read about it online. Mailing packages that fit the profile increase the (very small) risk of a package being intercepted.<br /><br />But other than that you are 100% correct. The average number of mailpieces processed each DAY by the USPS is 563 MILLION. Items packaged correctly mailed within the USA&nbsp; have a 99.999% chance of not being intercepted.

				I was visited by law enforcement this week, and for the sake of the site I hope it was the result of errors by the relatively inexperienced seller I took a chance on, and nothing more than that. If a seller is busted and has your address lying around then it&#039;s your fault for putting faith in such a guy. A simple interception is very unlikely but not out of the question, but again it&#039;s on the seller and I don&#039;t doubt the trust generated by many sellers here. Like many I&#039;m complacent and didn&#039;t use PGP, obviously it could have reduced the chances of me being flagged and I&#039;ve taken responsibility for that, narrowly avoiding arrest. My fault, but with the strange happenings on SR and wider attention to the site you can&#039;t help but wonder what varied interests are coming into play here, and how they&#039;re doing it.
