				I&#039;ve always wondered what to do in this situation. I know the forum captchas blow but idk if the SR main site uses the same ones... could be one possibility

				Have you tried creating another account to see what happens. Might help you trouble shoot the problem more. <br /><br />If you can log in with a new account than you might have to reset your password.

				I&#039;ve been logging in and back out for the past 48 hours almost constantly while I putter around over here, and I haven&#039;t had a single problem.&nbsp; In fact it&#039;s been suspiciously fast the past 12-24 hours... with no failed connections.&nbsp; No TTL errors, so SOCKS errors, no timeout errors, no &quot;failed to login&quot; errors... it&#039;s almost like I&#039;m connecting to the site without Tor or something...<br /><br />... I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Just thought I&#039;d mention that I&#039;ve had plenty of chances to run into issues, and haven&#039;t hit a single one.&nbsp; Odd as it may be.<br />

				I think the problem is relegated to me and my accounts, for whatever reason.&nbsp; Just wasn&#039;t sure if anyone here managed to get back into their accounts after these problems or what.
