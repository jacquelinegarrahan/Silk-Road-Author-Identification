				Was pretty crap, wasn&#039;t exclusively about Silk Road but the dark net in general. I expect the Daily Mail will pick up the story later this week for a bit of extra sensationalism. Should be available as a podcast on the beebs website in an hour or so...

				The nation needs a new moral panic. We haven&#039;t really had one since the paedophiles which by co-incidence we were sort of discussing on another thread...!<br /><br />Although actually thinking about it, we did have a moral panic of sorts over mephedrone a few years back didn&#039;t we?

				Yeah but this time it&#039;s faceless gun-toting pedos pushing killer ecstasy on the scarily named &#039;dark net&#039;, the gutter press couldn&#039;t make up a more delicious story. Wait &#039;til the Sun gets onto it!

				I made the recent programme about Silk Road. A colleague in BBC World is also keen to people on this site. Here&#039;s a message from him below.<br />Thanks for all your help with the last programme. I didn&#039;t want to make it without having input from people who use Silk Road.<br />Kirsteen.<br /><br />Hello: I&#039;m a colleague of Kirsteen Knight&#039;s at the BBC in London - and I&#039;m making a radio documentary about internet governance and security - the series will air globally on BBC World Service.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m keen to talk to anyone who uses or has used sites like Silk Road - just to get a snip of personal testimony about how easy it is to use the &#039;dark web&#039;, and what can be bought, how effective it is etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s radio only - no pix - and of course we can guarantee anonymity. Kirsteen has kindly agreed to help me by posting this request - please can you contact me via her if you might be willing to help? Alternatively, I&#039;m at michael.gallagher@bbc.co.uk&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for considering this - MG.<br /><br />Michael Gallagher<br /><br />Producer: BBC World Service<br /><br />Bush House<br /><br />London WC2B 4PH&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />tel +44 (0)1763 246034<br /><br />mob +44 (0)7968 304588<br />

				why would anyone from this site want to help you guys after you air a bunch of propaganda bullshit? I thought reporters jobs were to inform the public, not to push government propaganda and scare tactics. Go fuck off.

				Please read the recently published article in Playboy Australia if you want an idea of what unbiased journalism looks like.&nbsp; It&#039;s the only piece that has presented the straight-forward facts on SR and taken the community itself into account (also I was quoted in it ;) )<br /><br />Is violence off the streets really scaring you moralists that badly you want to keep caging people when they aren&#039;t even leaving their fucking houses while claiming the right to their own bodies?&nbsp;

				Helping the BBC was a major dumbo move. The BBC and other MSM &quot;news&quot; outlets are notoriously infiltrated by intelligence agents. They will of course tell you you will remain anonymous but you very well could have just got yourself a DEA or NSA tail. ALL mainstream non-agorists should be off limits. I won&#039;t be sending you any canteen.<br />
