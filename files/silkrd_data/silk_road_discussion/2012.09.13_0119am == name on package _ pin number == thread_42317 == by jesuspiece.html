				I&#039;m wondering if its common procedure to put your real actual name on the package? Isn&#039;t that a risk factor if customs gets it. I also have a major problem. I don&#039;t remember what I made my pin number, is there any way i can recover it. I have 12 coins on this account, and I&#039;m going to be absolutely livid if I can&#039;t retrieve that pin number some how.

				My god bro, I saved it in my text document, I&#039;m such a STUD!!!!!<br /><br /><br />Now I read a buyer said if I hadn&#039;t ordered from him before he wants you to finalize early. What does that mean??? I&#039;m looking at the place it takes you after you order something, where it says verified orders. Will I have to wait to be able to finalize it???

				they want u to fork over the cash first.. since they want to lower costs and scam chances with new buyers..<br />apart from that.. u got to wait about 2 days to finalize early after the order is placed and checked out the cart&nbsp; with your payment<br /><br />DONT EVER FE ! well my opinion.. unless u know and trust the vendor

Look for forum reviews/people who have been on road a long time rather than only a month. Also start slow and low, don&#039;t go spending your 12BTC in the same place, spread it around :P<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Ive read that its more of a red flag to customs if they do stop something and the name doesnt match the address.( on whatever file they hold that on - I imagine UK would be electoral role, maybe council tax list?)<br />You should always use your real name - remember plausible deniability - should it be stopped there is no way of proving you ordered or <br />even knew about it - anyone can send anyone anything through the post.<br />Ive always used my real name and never had any problems, and although i got beaten up a lot at school I guess I should be thanking my<br />parents for naming me &#039;The Legal Occupier&#039;.haha<br /><br />Peace.

				pyslo is right - simply deny any knowledge of ordering something. <br /><br />And using your real name is fine, otherwise the post could send it anywhere: Murphy&#039;s Law would dictate that something you want (like SR orders) would get lost. It also implies that junk mail will always get to you &amp; never get lost. <br /><br />Again, if Customs comes a-knocking, play dumb.
