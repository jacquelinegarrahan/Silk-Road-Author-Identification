				I thought it would be interesting to share the latest new articles from around the world to get a better picture of what the outside media believes to be going on inside SR. Its good to know what the outside world thinks of us and how they portray TSR to the general public.<br /><br />Here is a recent one i just stumbled upon, its pretty clear we all know who the article is about but more interestingly is the comments below lots of people using normal usernames and quite probably without TOR behind them posting about SR, even more so journalists posting inside SR and lurking about then selling their stories to the press.<br />http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/willardfoxton2/100008731/crisis-on-the-silk-road-if-you-cant-trust-britains-biggest-online-drug-dealer-who-can-you-trust/<br /><br />So feel free to share other interesting articles you find.

				Already been up bud, think they all have to be honest out of all the articles I have read on SR the Telegraph is the least judgmental and seems like its been written by some who has either used or knows some one that has used the road I have a feeling that the road will eventually start getting good press (strange I know)

Yes you are right but it will take time and as shocking as it sounds the older generations (people in their 50&#039;s/60&#039;s/70&#039;s) just need to die off then we can make progress as they are the most brain washed out of the bunch its a shame a real shame that so many people believe the propaganda still but I myself fell for it as a teenager all we can do is educate and never be ashamed of smoking your herb!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
