				I ordered a gram from a very reliable vendor (or so i thought), and i had a couple issues with him already.

				I would talk to the vendor and see if they&#039;ll work it out with you. I wouldn&#039;t take it to resolution... If you have good credit/not on any blacklists, good vendors will try to work things out. If they short you and won&#039;t work it out or AT LEAST hear you out, I don&#039;t see why they should receive a 5/5. I have yet to deal with anyone like that. I guess I would probably make a forum post too. Nothing crusade-y. Just an appeal. Documenting your account as &quot;not a scammer&quot; and them as &quot;maybe with issues.&quot; And if they admit fault then you both appear reasonable!<br /><br /><br />

				If he doesn&#039;t try and make it fair I&#039;d just say fuck it and give him a 1/5, unless you think .2 of whatever you got is worth increasing your refund rate.

				Perhaps he thought he tared the scale.&nbsp; Prior to taking it to resolution, give him the benefit of the doubt and tell him.&nbsp; If it was an honest mistake he will more than likely try to make it right.

				I finalised on a gram of coke and a few days later weighed it and my scale showed .8 and doesn&#039;t show in between so could have been anywhere between .8 and .9. I tested my scales with a coin knowing it&#039;s weight and proved the scales was OK so I weighed the coke again a couple of times and still .8 so I sent the seller a message asking if they&#039;ll sort it with my next order and they apologized saying they would.<br /><br />One thing I&#039;ve noticed with my scales is to use a wafer thin film with no wait rested on the scales when pouring the coke onto it to judge the weight because I used heavier paper before and thought my order was well underweight but realized the scales needed a no wait holder if you like to be more accurate.<br /><br />A gram should be 1.0 or slightly over but NEVER under 1.0. Let them know<br /><br />

				This is a PERFECT example of what to do when there is a problem with a vendor. Be cool and inform them. Don&#039;t run to the principal right away.<br /><br />I am glad you did and it was/will be handled.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Though I think Vendors should not make mistakes the fact is we will. But I do not think ANY vendor or should I say any good vendor does it on purpose. It would be bad business. And like you said...I guess there is a reason he has a 100. If you choose a great vendor then you will get a great outcome.<br /><br />Glad your happy.

				Maybe my mind is just drained after a long night of partying, but, the OP updated with saying &quot;..the seller admitted it was a mistake.&quot;<br />I&#039;m curious though, how can he admit it was a mistake after having sent the package? For example, if he sent it out, we assume HE thought he was mailing 1gram. But the buyer received .81 grams (on his clock) of product. When bringing it up with the vendor, how can the vendor verify the buyer is right? And if he admits it was a simple mistake (which I&#039;m sure it was).. does that mean he has previously sent out .8 packages instead of 1G on more then one occasion, and thus when asked by the seller he agreed that could have been the case? <br />Am I even making sense? Fuck, I need sleep.&nbsp; :-X

				@ colorblack---- The only way he knows he made a mistake is because the buyer messaged him and said so. So lets say I shipped out 50 pills and the buyer says &quot; hey rx I got my package and I actually had 49 not 50&quot;<br /><br />I would respond&quot; Sorry about that...it was a mistake obv, I will send you another 1 or I will refund you...you tell me...sorry&quot;<br /><br />So I would say I made a mistake as would anyone else ..I think that is the correct lingo you would use if you were a vendor...Unless of course you knew for a fact it was not short...then you would send something like this<br /><br />&quot; Hey you lying fucking asshole. I know it had 50 in because it is counted by 3 people and checked off by each person BEFORE it is sent..so no mistakes are EVER made! So quit fucking lying and enjoy your package because that is the last one you will ever get from me...you lying fucking dirt ball loser!!&quot;<br /><br />:) or something like that ;) Never happened..and that&#039;s why.

I think that&#039;s the best policy anyway. I mean how can you complain about things like that? It&#039;s beyond me but the fact you still sorted it out even though it was over anyway just shows how dedicated you are. <br /><br />after reading this im actually considering doing some business with you. What sort of grade is your weed and do you have a link to a listing? <br />would you ship international? (im assuming you are in the states) And is your stealth up to scratch to get through customs? (no offense, Some people&#039;s aren&#039;t. ) <br />If so i would probably be willing to start off with a QP From you. <br />Cheers mate <br />Hff ;)

				That makes sense. And yep, I agree that with scales.. it&#039;s really a murky area because who&#039;s to say the buyers scale is calibrated right? Secondly, to play devils advocate, a less then honest buyer could say &quot;Hey XYZ vendor, I ordered and 8ball but you messed up and only sent me 2 grams.. please send me the remaining 1.5grams or else I&#039;ll leave negative feedback&quot; and essentially blackmail the vendor. Or in your case I can say &quot;King I ordered 50 pills and you must have made a mistake and only sent me 5.. and I&#039;m about to leave that in the feedback&quot;.. and yes you could (and will :)) tell the guy to go fuck himself and you would never make such a mistake or pull something like that, but then other buyers reading feedback would see something like that and hesitate to buy from a vendor. It seems that there is a slight unfair advantage against vendors when it comes to feedback. I am not saying the OP made up the .2gram discrepancy, (and by reading it sounds like the vendor just made an honest mistake).. but I wonder how vendors handle that fine line when their feedback/rating is on the line.

And now that you shot back the message you did I will address it.<br /><br />There is NOTHING worse then being a vendor and having someone say lies about you in your feedback and then try and blackmail you saying you will remove it if you get&nbsp; free drugs sent. I have heard this happening to MANY a vendor in the vendor only forum. So it is not talked about out here much though I have seen it. And the only thing that is actually worse then that...is when someone makes a post in a thread...a long one..and it comes off as if they never even read the thread! So they say all this shit and it is totally inaccurate...I mean way off base. They read the OP...but then go to the reply and say there shit without seeing that the OP could have made another post. We have all seen this many a time..<br /><br />&nbsp;It is terrible for the vendor in question because in 99% of the cases people only read the latest post(the bs one) and in this case it would be yours and if they did that ...they would believe something that is totally not true. Now the good news is there is no vendors name in here(i think)...and that is why I let it go and kind of brushed over it saying the last paragraph of yours is garbage basically ...while I still made a comment on you giving us a whole run down of what he *could be doing* if he was sending out .8 grams instead of 1 gram. Except by the time you wrote your post it had already been said that the vendor got back to them and made a mistake and will fix it. Also the poster said &quot; that is why he has a 100 feedback&quot; or something like that.<br />But your post was as if you never read anything but the OP. But you have good Karma and though it is fucking terrible when someone does not read the thread and makes a post up basicaly..in this case there is no vendor name and so you did no harm....but when you come back with this post and you do not aknowlesge you made a huge error and you do not fix your post by editing it..that is bullshit.And it is not like you said one this you said this----<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160790.msg1141522#msg1141522">Quote from: HeatFireFlame on May 18, 2013, 05:37 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />I think you did the right thing, maybe should have gave him a 4/5 but more or the less the right thing, Maybe message him and judge him by his response, if he hears you out and agrees some sort of deal great, no issues, if he hears you out but refuses then i defo dont think he deserved the 5.5 tell him he has lost a customer and explain why, if he doesn&#039;t even give you the time of day then i would maybe post in the rumor mill and let people know. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And since the OP said this-----<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160790.msg1139785#msg1139785">Quote from: sofish89 on May 18, 2013, 04:52 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">UPDATE<br />I spoke to seller and he was more than reasonable.

And you completely wrong. And you can fix it by editing your post and deleting the bullshit. <br /><br />So hopefully you can see how wrong your post was...because the vendor in fact did the right thing...and in the future BEFORE you post try reading the whole thread and be accurate in what you say. Again since there is no vendor name it is pretty harmless and no biggie...except for the fact you made a post in a thread that is wrong. But as I said before.. I think your a good guy and you just missed the post the OP made. And maybe you are saying you can only see the OP and nothing else.I have no clue...but you should delete your last paragraph.

I don&#039;t think you&nbsp; read the OP&#039;s full post..if you did you would read that the vendor got back to him and said he clearly made a mistake and he would fix it. So the last paragraph of your message doesn&#039;t really make sense...No biggie..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Had to laugh at the mr.conspirator remark. I just double checked now mate and this is still all im getting for some fucked up reason. So that&#039;s why i posted what i did. But still , You have to admit ,selling to newbies who cant take it to rumor mill, and making an extra 5.gs or so off an oz of coke if you were scraping 0.2 off each G is pretty damn profitable and a little dodgy but yeah fair enough. <br /><br />All the best Hff ;)<br /><br /><br />I ordered a gram from a very reliable vendor (or so i thought), and i had a couple issues with him already. Now finally my pack arrives and the scale says it weighs out to 0.81 G for a one gram order. Now with the bag (which weighed .25), it was over a gram, but plain powder was underweight.<br />I didnt want to make a big deal in resolution center over a one gram order that was a little short so i finalized and left him a 5/5 but mentioned it was underweight..<br />I&#039;m just curious what others would do,<br />how much is enough for it to be cinsidered underweight?<br />What would you do if you only got a 0.7 or 0.8 for a one gram order?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What does your first sentence mean when you say &quot;still this is all i&#039;m getting???&quot; The sentence that starts with &quot;had to laugh&quot;<br /><br />What are you only getting?? <br /><br />I call you Mr.conspirator because in your post&nbsp; you instantly start off with &quot;if he did it to 5 people&quot; and you go on to explain how that would be a gram and a gram is a lot of money...ect ect ect...and I was just being soft on you because I didn&#039;t want to really hammer you on what you said...THOUGH I did say your whole last paragraph means nothing and you should not have written it at all. And now that you shot back the message you did I will address it.<br /><br />There is NOTHING worse then being a vendor and having someone say lies about you in your feedback and then try and blackmail you saying you will remove it if you get&nbsp; free drugs sent. I have heard this happening to MANY a vendor in the vendor only forum. So it is not talked about out here much though I have seen it. And the only thing that is actually worse then that...is when someone makes a post in a thread...a long one..and it comes off as if they never even read the thread! So they say all this shit and it is totally inaccurate...I mean way off base. They read the OP...but then go to the reply and say there shit without seeing that the OP could have made another post. We have all seen this many a time..<br /><br />&nbsp;It is terrible for the vendor in question because in 99% of the cases people only read the latest post(the bs one) and in this case it would be yours and if they did that ...they would believe something that is totally not true. Now the good news is there is no vendors name in here(i think)...and that is why I let it go and kind of brushed over it saying the last paragraph of yours is garbage basically ...while I still made a comment on you giving us a whole run down of what he *could be doing* if he was sending out .8 grams instead of 1 gram. Except by the time you wrote your post it had already been said that the vendor got back to them and made a mistake and will fix it. Also the poster said &quot; that is why he has a 100 feedback&quot; or something like that.<br />But your post was as if you never read anything but the OP. But you have good Karma and though it is fucking terrible when someone does not read the thread and makes a post up basicaly..in this case there is no vendor name and so you did no harm....but when you come back with this post and you do not aknowlesge you made a huge error and you do not fix your post by editing it..that is bullshit.And it is not like you said one this you said this----<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160790.msg1141522#msg1141522">Quote from: HeatFireFlame on May 18, 2013, 05:37 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />I think you did the right thing, maybe should have gave him a 4/5 but more or the less the right thing, Maybe message him and judge him by his response, if he hears you out and agrees some sort of deal great, no issues, if he hears you out but refuses then i defo dont think he deserved the 5.5 tell him he has lost a customer and explain why, if he doesn&#039;t even give you the time of day then i would maybe post in the rumor mill and let people know. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And since the OP said this-----<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160790.msg1139785#msg1139785">Quote from: sofish89 on May 18, 2013, 04:52 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">UPDATE<br />I spoke to seller and he was more than reasonable.

Im in total agreement with you about the whole cunts blackmailing you for more drugs and threatening you with negative feedback, I did read the full fucking thread and it&#039;s assholes like you that try and act like they know everything that really get to me. <br />The reason that people haven&#039;t ranted about that stuff here is because it&#039;s obviously going to be vendors ranting about it, hence why it&#039;s in the vendor forums. <br /><br />There is absolutely no reason for youto start this full bullshit rant about things that are not even important. I was saying for the guy to try and resolve it with the vendor first of all befoe doing anything, And yes that was correct i could not see the update for some reason, so only had his original statement.<br /><br />I get your idea about the whole not reading posts and things, There is nothing more annoying than having to explain something to an idiot who did not read a post properly, but i did and the update was not showing up and the last paragraph made sense because i couldn&#039;t see it. hence why there was no reason for you to start ragging on me with a major speech.<br /><br />I actually cant still see the update fuck knows why. However i strive to be a good member of the community and appreciate my karma, You by the way do not have a very good rating,<br />But being honest i see why you posted that even if it was slightly eccentric because it must be showing up on your PC. <br /><br />i say lets let bygones be bygones and just let this slide. it was clearly a misunderstanding ; And one not worth arguing over. <br />Hff :)

Fuck yea I point out when someone is as wrong as you!<br /><br />BTW this is how you properly break down a thread with REAL QUOTES...not like you banter where you actually agree with every single thing I said..but you say it is a ago-rant way like you are correct...like a fucking cop would...when in fact you are dead fucking wrong...You actually break down and rant just like a pig. Thinking your smart calling me stupid and saying for me to calm down and blah blah blah.<br /><br />All I will admit to is I totally did not have to do this. Meaning the first post where I call you out for being dead wrong. I should just let the idiots post and not say a word. Because I should only be allowed to call one person out a week and I already reached that limit. And God knows that there are a bunch of morons in here...that hate to be called out...that hate guys that talk shit and are always right and they hate people that leave long messages...yes those people exist and to them I say I am sorry that you read everything I say and then bitch about it. I know you are forced to read it as there is NOTHING else interesting to read in these forums. And I&nbsp; know I should leave this poor guy alone because he is clearly an idiot. And I should not curse, I should not call people names, and I should just let people say stupid shit. Except for 1 thing. I am not sorry and I was 100% right AGAIN. And when I am wrong I will admit to it and I will fix my wrong. Not rant about it and throw up a smoke screen.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />

Im in total agreement with you about the whole cunts blackmailing you for more drugs and threatening you with negative feedback, I did read the full fucking thread and it&#039;s assholes like you that try and act like they know everything that really get to me.<br />The reason that people haven&#039;t ranted about that stuff here is because it&#039;s obviously going to be vendors ranting about it, hence why it&#039;s in the vendor forums. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Like after your last unreal stupid as shit post I should think you got my sarcasm??? I mean FUCK NO. I THINK YOU ARE DUMB AS A ROCK AT THIS POINT!! And so does everyone else that will read this perfect breakdown of your shit. Not YOUR rant that try&#039;s to hide all your bullshit and makes me out to be the asshole because I point all this out. Fuck yea I point out when someone is as wrong as you!<br /><br />BTW this is how you properly break down a thread with REAL QUOTES...not like you banter where you actually agree with every single thing I said..but you say it is a ago-rant way like you are correct...like a fucking cop would...when in fact you are dead fucking wrong...You actually break down and rant just like a pig. Thinking your smart calling me stupid and saying for me to calm down and blah blah blah.<br /><br />All I will admit to is I totally did not have to do this. Meaning the first post where I call you out for being dead wrong. I should just let the idiots post and not say a word. Because I should only be allowed to call one person out a week and I already reached that limit. And God knows that there are a bunch of morons in here...that hate to be called out...that hate guys that talk shit and are always right and they hate people that leave long messages...yes those people exist and to them I say I am sorry that you read everything I say and then bitch about it. I know you are forced to read it as there is NOTHING else interesting to read in these forums. And I&nbsp; know I should leave this poor guy alone because he is clearly an idiot. And I should not curse, I should not call people names, and I should just let people say stupid shit. Except for 1 thing. I am not sorry and I was 100% right AGAIN. And when I am wrong I will admit to it and I will fix my wrong. Not rant about it and throw up a smoke screen.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I thought you just misunderstood me, Now i think your a dick with nothing else to do, Why did you not just clearly state it was a different thread then? Not an update on the thread which i obviously thought you meant. <br /><br />you call me mr conspiracy theorist yet your the one trying to confuse everything. Can you not make things short and sweet instead of making posts that take 5 mins to read. <br />I think your dumb as a rock, With your stupid and unreasonable posts, And i have looked up your previous posts and thats why you have negative karma, because you are rude incoherent and unreasonable. Why cant you just admit it was all a misunderstanding like i am trying to say, You have to make it an arguent. people like you ruin the forums. <br /><br />i obviously went back to check the OP as i thought he would have updated it, Not made a new post and could not see anything so i blamed it on the PC, yet you want to make me out to be somebody who has been trying to hide behind some excuse which is clearly false. <br /><br />You want to try and call me &quot;smarty&quot; yet you post things like this, When im the one trying to say it was claerly a misunderstanding lets leave it at that, <br /><br />And then you say you don&#039;t want to argue??? An argument is when two people have a point and they are trying to get the other to see there side and take it. Not when someone is 100% correct (me) and you actually break down everything I said and AGREE with me!!!!<br /><br />But it upsets you &quot;it&#039;s assholes like you that try and act like they know everything that really get to me.&quot; So you agree that I am 100%. You agree that your post was just like I said &quot; 100%&quot; wrong. So in this case I did know everything about this post..and I knew everything about you being wrong..and I am the asshole...not you in any way??<br /><br />Though after your first post and I call you out you come back with this----<br /><br />You &quot;call me out&quot; , Seriously what is the need for that? CVall me out because i made a mistake in thinking he updated his original post instead of a new post. Ooohh that is a good reason. Look what you have actually done because of something so small, I can practically feel your little blood vessels bursting out your forehead as your typing that response, People like cause more arguments than it&#039;s worth, And i cant even be bothered wasting my time arguing with somebody who is 100% convinced they are right all the time.<br /><br />this guy is actually trying to say i rant &quot;like a cop&quot; <br />hahaha what a fucking loser. Go fuck yourself you asshole. nah better yet go pull your tiny 1 incher you fucking stupid cunt. <br /><br />I try and settle things and you try and keep them going. You wont get far in life. trust me. Your just a simpleton with way too much time on his hands. <br />I made a mistake yes, Which was thinking he had updated his post and it hadn&#039;t showed up on my computer, thats all. YOU MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT AND RANT IN CAPITALS BECAUSE YOU THINK IT MAKES YOU LOOK HARD.<br /><br />You want to just call me names through the whole post? Great go on it only makes you look childish and stupid.<br />Your full of it. I cant wait to hear your next Bs post, actually im going to wait for it, haha anybody actually reading this, chec out his other posts. This is the way he always is. such a jackass. <br /><br />You end with thank you? haha to who? everybody because you wasted 10 minutes of their life reading your shitty book you wrote. <br />Dont even bother replying, Your a loser and i wouldn&#039;t want everybody here to waste their time reading your incoherent shit. <br /><br />Sorry to anybody who had to read all this. <br /><br /><br /><br />To sum up this is what happened. <br /><br />I confused the fact that the OP did not update his original post and actually wrote another post to update it. Then this guy decides to make a full rant about it.. does anybody see the point? <br />he says im trying to confuse things and throw up smokescreens yet all he does it muddy the water when there&#039;s no need for it to be done. make it out as if im some sort of madman on the forums trying to confuse people, what would be the point? i was just adding my 2cents to the OP ,He sounds like the conspiracy theorist to me, making all these wild accusations and insinuations.&nbsp; (it&#039;s ok to use words like this because obviously hes to stupid to understand them)

				Guy let me help you...do not post anymore...let this go. You clearly have no clue what you are doing...you try and blame me&nbsp; in the first paragraph for not telling you exactly where his post is...but at least learn the difference between a post and a thread...this whole thing is a thread...he posted in this thread that the vendor contacted him. Jesus....even in the first paragraph your crying and whining and you just refuse to be honest. Typical of someone who gets called out and I of course quote you and repeat everything you said and tell you how stupid and wrong each thing you said is...and you refuse to be honest...just a liar....like a cop. And I do not in any way think you are a cop...you are just acting like one...fake tough guy...they are dead wrong and proven so but believe they are right..they get upset because they got called out..and they just don&#039;t like to be called out..in fact they will say shit like &quot; I don&#039;t like a cocky guy...I don&#039;t like to be called out ..that&#039;s bullshit I am going to get him&quot; And guess what...that is what you are doing...I just tried to help you and you start saying stupid shit..that is why I quoted you.. because I know your type..I have been exposing them for over a year in this forum...<br /><br />You say shit like &quot;nah better yet go pull your tiny 1 incher you fucking stupid cunt.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s your come back? I quote you and I show anyone that can read how stupid you are..and you say that? This is the perfect example that shows how childish you are and how you can not compete with facts...so you act like a 9th grader...like a little future cop would and say &quot;pull out your 1 incher and fuck your cunt?&quot; It is one thing to attack someone and call them stupid because they are(like yourself) really stupid.. but when you speak like this....this clearly means you have nothing to say....your desperate and your embarrassed...I feel bad for you. And when you start acting like this you show how ignorant you are and that is sad.<br /><br />To show you how much of an idiot you are..you just said that 9th grade pre cop &quot; pull out your 1incher and fuck your cunt&quot; then you say this a paragraph down----<br /><br />You want to just call me names through the whole post? Great go on it only makes you look childish and stupid.<br />Your full of it. I cant wait to hear your next Bs post, actually im going to wait for it, haha anybody actually reading this, chec out his other posts. This is the way he always is. such a jackass. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t call you names...I called you stupid in a&nbsp; bunch of different ways. You are the one with the name calling..CLEARLY. ...and of course you cant keep track on your own lies in your own post so a paragraph after you call names and act like a 15yo boy...you talk about name calling and how it is bad...yet you just did it!!!! And I just call you&nbsp; stupid...and that is like calling you by your first name.Also everyone has read my post before....this is NOTHING NEW...Youre just another liar I expose...I have been exposing Liars and Cheats for over a year..and you are just my latest...And some people love them, and most could care less...BUT every time I call one of you liars and losers out...you get your feelings hurt...you say all the stupid shit you are saying..I of course laugh as I exposed you...you of course try a spin job...but every single person that reads your post and mine will agree with me...though there will be some people that do not like how I call you out....trust me the truth is 99.5 could care less. They will read just because they are bored..but a smart person that is neutral will 100% agree with me..it is impossible not too!! <br /><br />Also can you do math? Look how many more positive Karma points I have vs Negative... Since you get off on that stuff. And then realize Karma doe snot matter...but if it did..mine is better then yours:) I just want you to say one smart accurate thing in your next stupid post...though I do not think you should make another post...you should quit posting in this thread...if you do...you will look better then you do now..though I know you cant help telling lies...so go ahead and lie away. Also I love how you are waiting for me...lol...I would not wait for what you have to say ever. Then again..I am telling the truth like 60min...and you are lying. People want to hear the truth like me....you on the other hand...not so much..

				I agree with other people. Confront the vendor about it first and try and come to a mutual resolution.<br />But beforehand, make sure your scales are accurate and have been checked.

				ok i didnt read the last cpl posts they were too long for me..<br />but to clear up any confusion the vendor had answered my message saying that I was not the only perrson to complain and in fact he had several ppl complain that day and he said it was something with his new scales. He was very professional and it was cleared up. Never had such good customer service while buying drugs before lol<br />Welcome to the future :)
