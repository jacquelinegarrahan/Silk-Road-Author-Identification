				..if SR releases the funds anyway and the seller has a great excuse as to why the can&#039;t show you the DCN? That&#039;s not right. <br /><br />The seller conveniently closed shop and over 10 days later no package domestically. He said he can&#039;t provide me with the DCN because he&#039;s out of town for an unknown period of time. So the clock is ticking, and once SR steps in my buyer stats are going to be adversely affected regardless of outcome right? <br /><br />All I&#039;m asking for is to see the DCN so I know it was truly sent and delivered somewhere. The Escrow+DCN is the only defense a buyer has against good dealers turned scammer. Does SR take the DCN into account before rendering their decision? If not then this system is flawed in favor of the seller. Also the buyer must have the right to see the DCN to make sure that the package was not confiscated, which is my concern more than the money.<br />

				True, it is aggravating not being presented the DCN, especially if you have a PO box and you have to keep coming and going because the package isn&#039;t there, but it also somewhat prevents your package from being intercepted.

				If it was shipped with DCN, then yes they take DCN into account. If the vendor cannot provide it, it is likely that they don&#039;t have it, and are waiting for autofinalize with their &quot;out of town&quot; story. submit for 2 options in resolution, one for 100% refund due to no DCN provided, and the other for an extension of, say 50 days to give him time to find the DCN. the long extension (if he agrees), ties his money up for a long time, so he will likely make you a counter offer that is reasonable. It is your choice to acept it thou if you wants to and then you should still see DCN. most vendors I deal with in private provide the DCN @t the time of shiping to my so I can track progress in the system. I aam not sure why vendors on SR wait to resolvuting to disclose the DCN. I mean amitures think it is safer to hol d it until to resolve and that opens up DNC scams where they ship to similar locations and give that DCN to the moderator to show that a blank package was delivered to your areas and they deserve getting paid. I never been threw one of this, but I want DCN (when I ask for it) @t the time of payment because thats how the real pros do it.<br /><br />wretched

Those are for us not you. They are not tracking.<br /><br />But this vendor is doing you wrong 100%. If he has the DCN then he should tell you he has it and provide it to you... not some bullshit excuse like the one you are telling us about.<br /><br />Who is this vendor? How long ago was your order purchased? How was it shipped? What was the item? All of this matters.<br /><br />Also don&#039;t let it auto finalize. And don&#039;t offer him 50 more days or anything like that. That is silly. Either he can prove it was delivered or you get a refund. Simple as that. All those questions matter and depending on those I could give you a better explanation.<br /><br />Bottom line is if he can provide SR a DCN then he wins the case. As it should be. If he can&#039;t...then you win. That is the point of the DCN. There is NO GOOD excuse. You either have it or you don&#039;t. The odds of him having another order in your zip code are about 100000 to1. So your safe there. It would have to be an order at the same time as your too.<br /><br />Please answer those questions and I can help you more.<br /><br />Sorry this is happening to you. It sucks that your with out BTC and product. And you contacted the vendor and basically got a nothing he can do response.

You can agree to disagree with me, but it has been my experience over these past 2 years.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />My definition is probably the same...<br /><br />My point is this...There is ZERO reason for you to ever need a DCN..... ZERO. <br /><br />It&#039;s not like tracking for FedEx where you can see where your package is every 5 minutes. The only reason it is good is for if a customer says he did not get the package then the vendor can prove he sent it and it was delivered. That&#039;s it. <br /><br />Why all the other stuff I asked you is important(and once again you answered none of it) is that if your order was a QP of weed versus 10 Xanax bars there is a big difference. If it was not sent from USA there is a big difference. If it was shipped Priority and it has been less then 7 days there is a big difference.<br /><br />We are getting off topic talking about what my definition vs. your is really does not matter. But since we are already here I will continue. As I said above there is NO REASON at all a buyer ever needs a DCN. NEVER. As for vendors that are here on SR that are USA vendors, none of them have shipped more then I have in the lat 10+ years. I know a lot about the USPS and I know it is 100% bullshit about checking your DCN is TOR. It makes ZERO difference. But the truth is there is never a need to check.<br /><br />Assuming you ordered from a USA vendor and you ordered Priority, and the vendor gave you the date it actually shipped. Then you should know the day it would be delivered. Now about 1 in 200 Priority packages take longer then the 3-5 days. And about the same number (1 in 200) get &quot;lost&quot; for a few days. But assuming your mail was not stolen from where you live then it will get to you for sure. We have not even established that it was in fact sent! Or how it was sent(Priority vs Express). But I have shipped over 10,000 packages and never lost 1. EVER. Yes I know it can happen, but it is really rare.<br /><br />If a vendor is a pro then they should give you the exact time your package was shipped and give you the day it will be at your house. They would not need to give you a DCN. When customers that are new ask me about them they always want it so they know what day it will be delivered. Either they have to beat their wife or their roommate to the mailbox or they do not want to make more trips to the PO then are necessary. I understand that and I give all my customers the day I believe it will be delivered. And I say that I am right about 98% <br /><br />On SOME not all( this is another reason DCN suck for tracking) the DCN will say &quot;out for delivery&quot;. This is great and if they always said that and were accurate.... I could make a case for giving out DCN&#039;s. But since they are not ( and the USPS defense they are not supposed to be...they are exactly what they say..Delivery confirmation) tracking numbers and in no way are close to what you get with a tracking number from FedEx, I don&#039;t give them out. I have about 10% of my customers ask me for them and in almost every case they come back and say &quot; oh my bad...the mail was late it is here). I have had about 4 Priority packages in 5 months take the full 5 days to get there. And I had 1 that took 8 days. But it was the customers fault as they put wrong zip..But even it got there.<br /><br />So all the info that we do not have on your package really matters.<br /><br />But putting that all aside for a sec...The answer you gave us in your OP that you got from the vendor is total bullshit. How many days since he &quot;shipped&quot; the package are you waiting on as of now? When you first asked him...what was his response? Is this a USA to USA package? Who is the vendor?&nbsp; Does the vendor have current listings? <br /><br />It does not prove it was sent to the right address. It does not prove there was something in the box....ect. That&#039;s why it is important to know the answers to the questions I asked.<br /><br />The title of your post and what your OP actually said were a bit different. It sounded like you were asking what is the point of a DCN as in.... for SR when a package go&#039;s missing and they need to step in and how it is used in determining the outcome of the case....One thing you said that can&#039;t happen is if the vendor can not give SR the DCN but has a &quot;great&quot; excuse...Tough shit! He loses. If he happened to have lost the DCN then tough shit..he loses. For SR they are the best and a MUST. for both the buyer and the sender.<br /><br />It proves that a package was sent. And it proves it was delivered. And that&#039;s it.&nbsp; IF the vendor can provide SR with that then HE wins. If he can&#039;t then YOU win. Sure there might be other circumstances that could affect the decision... Such as if the vendor really closed shop and there are other buyers that also did not get their package.<br /><br />In your case it sounds more like it was never sent since the vendors excuse is a shitty one. Also if he closed shop then that makes it even more likely he didn&#039;t send out your package IMO. <br /><br />Your other main question in your OP was your buyer stats. You asked if they will be affected &quot;either way&quot;.&nbsp; What are your stats now? That will make all the difference. You will get&nbsp; a refund stat if you are refunded. but not if the vendor refunds you because he never sent it. Again it is very hard to give you the correct answers since we have no real information.<br /><br />I hope you understand what I am saying and the point I am trying to make.<br /><br />

But they would have had to send the package the same day so that delivery was when the other package was supposed to be delivered. They couldn&#039;t do it now and claim it was his. The DCN does give a ship date and a delivered date. It would make no sense to do that. That is one of the reasons it is important to know what vendor and what was the drug.<br /><br />It would be easier for the vendor to ship an empty box if he was out to scam a customer. Then it would be his word vs the buyer. They take all this in to account...Its not cut and dry per say. But if the DCN say&#039;s delivered and the vendor has no history of packages not being delivered then he is going to win. <br /><br />The DCN protect the vendor more then the buyer. That is for sure.<br /><br />

				A DCN for buyers can come in handy for certain situations, for instance a buyer may be using a drop box for delivery and getting there package sent to an abandoned house or a letterbox of there choice, a DCN is very helpful as it prevents having to check the letterbox everyday hoping that your product has arrived (this is more for international orders that can take 14 days+). It may also be good for safety as if your DCN says that your item has been in customs for 3 days then all of a sudden gets shipped out (possible controlled delivery) you may have second thoughts about trying to pick that package up and should write that letterbox off and never use it again.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thanks for the info on DCN&#039;s and my rights as a buyer guys. <br />I have to let you all know that the post office messed up and sent my package to a wrong zip code, and eventually made it to me between 9 to 12 days later than it should have. This was domestic. From this vendor, it usually takes 2-4 days. Looks like the post office is really messing up due to their cutbacks.&nbsp; This had all the signs of a vendor out of town and couldn&#039;t check DCN&#039;s excuse, so of course I was suspicious and pissed.<br /><br />You mentioned that packages are lost 1 out of 200 times. I must be the unluckiest person in the world, because now this has happened to me more than once in the past 2 months. When this happens, tensions rise between customer and sellers where each side blames the other for scamming, and in reality it&#039;s just the post office fucking up.
