				Alright. So, I was browsing the LSD section and stumbled upon a seller misleadingly selling LSB within there, but I decided to purchase five tabs of it anyway. Then I get the following message-<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hello friend .<br />I receive data from my product. My supplier make a mistake and this products its not LSB but LSZ -&gt; there you have analysis http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2ufzsqb&amp;s=6 but dosage is for LSZ ( 50 ug - 300 ug) , its very rare lizergamide . I hope that you are not angry ;-) Its still good product<br />Cheers</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So they apparently sent me &#039;LSV&#039;. I have no idea if that&#039;s true or not, because from my research I&#039;ve found that LSV is an LSD analogue that&#039;s supposed to be more potent.<br /><br />If the drug worked I&#039;d&#039;ve still paid full money despite the deceit. Yet I took three tabs, and they tasted absolutely nasty- like the smell of acetone/nail polish remover. 45 minutes in, the trip started... I got ghost images when I moved my hands, some liquid-like distortion of words, but otherwise nothing and I didn&#039;t feel psychedelic. As it quickly wore off I redosed with two tabs which extended the trip an hour, but in the end all I got was a very boring trip from 11 to 2 (3 hours).<br /><br />I messaged the seller saying that no, I wasn&#039;t happy with their product and wanted a refund. On their profile they list 75%-100% refund for buyers in good standing; yet I get the following message–<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Because its lizergamide what did you say on 50 % refund? its not any dox and nbome.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/8cc892ce1a<br /><br />Which is fucking bullshit. I called the seller out and he said he&#039;d give a 75% refund.<br /><br />I feel I deserve my 100%. I don&#039;t think they purposefully scammed me, rather their dealer scammed them- but I paid a decent sum of money for a drug, and didn&#039;t receive that drug. Not only was the substitute not what I ordered but it was boring as fuck and left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been scammed too many times to accept a non-complete refund for a piss poor product. I ordered ecstasy pills for me and a friend in separate addresses, neither arrived, 50% refund on each. Ordered 3 LSD candies from another seller, never came, 50% refund. Was involved in the Lucydrop Finalize Early scam, did receive ten tabs but taking all ten at once only lead to a mild trip; was told I&#039;d receive more and didn&#039;t.<br /><br />If I file for 100% and he doesn&#039;t accept it, what do you think the SR admins will decide? Have you had similar experiences, and how did they go? Thank you very much for your advice.<br /><br />Edit: P.S.– another forum member with a post count not high enough to post outside of newbie messaged me, saying they&#039;d bought twenty from the same seller with the same experience and message. If they file, do you think the admins will look at the two cases and decide that the seller is at fault?

				I presume this&#039;ll be drowned by bitcoin crash posts.<br /><br />TL;DR edition:<br />Seller sent me wrong drug and admitted to it in SR messages. Drug sucked. I want 100% refund, seller will only give 75%. Will admins side with me for 100%?

				Only way to know is to put it into resolution. Selling the wrong drugs is pretty heavily frowned upon because it can be at best an unpleasant surprise and at worst dangerous. I&#039;d swing for 100% and see what they say, but be prepared to be very patient.

				Based on your post, I would probably have been happy with the 50% refund, def the 75%.<br />I say that only because in your op you said you thought it was dodgy, but went ahead anyway.<br />You identified the wrong product, used it anyway, and got something for the experience&nbsp; (albeit not what you wanted/paid for)<br /><br />I am not saying you did anything wrong, just that you did get some value from the initial screwed up deal.<br /><br />Sending the wrong product is obviously a huge mistake, but the vendor is trying to meet you somewhere north of middle.&nbsp; If it were me, I would take that.<br /><br />Then take it to another vendor.<br /><br />You may get 100% from SR because it was the wrong product, but you could get 75% right now with no wait, no hassle.&nbsp; <br />I am a bird in the hand kind of guy.

				Were you informed the drug was different before or after the transaction was finalised? I think there&#039;s a big difference between accepting it&#039;s different and having them sent anyway, and receiving drugs which you&#039;re then informed what you ordered. If the former, I&#039;d say 75% is a good deal. If the latter it&#039;s less clear cut, but you did take them all anyway, so even then 75% back probably isn&#039;t that bad. It was 50/50 upon being informed they were different whether they&#039;d be better or worse, you took the risk and it didn&#039;t pay off. I&#039;d liken it to receiving a different meal at a restaurant, being told it&#039;s different, eating the whole thing anyway and deciding once you&#039;d cleaned the plate that it was rubbish and you want your money back. <br /><br />Tl:dr - I&#039;d say 75% probably isn&#039;t a bad deal, take it.

Recently I&#039;ve also had a string of bad luck; two simultaneous orders of partyflock x pills never came (one to a friend&#039;s address) so 50% refund on each, two orders in the Lucydrop scam where we received ten tabs as strong as a single one and were promised a reship that never came, three LSD candies from a seller that never arrived and I was given a 50% refund for...<br /><br />And now this. I wasn&#039;t sent what I ordered and the sent material for all purposes didn&#039;t work.

				Nope. You knew what you were getting into. Technically, you shouldn&#039;t get any refund at all since you knew ahead of time that the product was &quot;dodgy.&quot; Own up to your risk taking. Don&#039;t transfer it to the vendor. Take responsibility for yourself. <br /><br />Click accept for the 75% refund and move on.&nbsp; It really is more than you deserve. <br /><br />Why am I harshing on you? Because it&#039;s buyers like you that are ruining this place for buyers like myself who take personal responsibility for our actions. <br /><br />Did the vendor fuck up? No, the vendor *is* a fuck up. You got into bed with a fucker and got fucked.&nbsp; Why the surprise? And you&#039;re going to turn around and double fuck him back by hoping he loses 100%+ on the transaction and dole out a 1/5 when you knew ahead of time that things wouldn&#039;t work out? That makes you more fucked up that the fucked up vendor.

				You ordered was told what the mix up was so you could&#039;ve stopped and made the vendor cancel from there but nope you went along with it used the drug then complained now should you get a refund definitely NO, as you knew what you was getting into from the off and could&#039;ve quite easily have stopped it but no you wanted this to happen knowing you could F, the vendor in the end if you even get 0.01% refund that&#039;s totally wrong and F, up cos I too had proof from do called messages between me snd a vendor I was 110% in the rite but SR admin still sided with the vendor at 0% for me and I got took for £130 even though I had proof there so like I said you knew from the off and your messages don&#039;t mean ish really if your being offered 75% and your here still trying boy your a good scam artist defo

Lucydrop seemed like a reputable vendor by all accounts- but I finalized when I received tabs and they ended up being bunk, no reship; and that was two orders- one for a friend. Once ordered Ecstasy pills from a 300+ seller, 98% positive, again one order to me and one to a friend (in a completely different part of the country)- never received either order, 50% refund on each. Ordered 3 LSD candies from a 99% positive seller, 300+ transacs, different country from non-arrived X pills; package never came, 50% refund.<br /><br />This time around I mistakenly ordered LSB (listed under the LSD section) as my eyes missed one letter. But then, after the item was shipped, the seller told me it&#039;s not LSB- it&#039;s LSV. Eventually we came to a refund agreement and the seller told me that they were retesting the tabs (I doubt it).<br /><br />Perhaps you still perceive this is all my fault, despite the double deception. Regardless, I&#039;ve decided to be more responsible with my bitcoin and just ordered some incredibly expensive tablets that are from a very well known, cleanest LSD, top-end seller- it cost an arm and a leg but I&#039;m dying for the real stuff.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You ordered was told what the mix up was so you could&#039;ve stopped and made the vendor cancel from there but nope you went along with it used the drug then complained now should you get a refund definitely NO</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Did you read?

				Damn bro, maybe you should just give up on SR for awhile, don&#039;t you think?<br /><br />Seems to me like you&#039;re ultimately paying a bunch of money to get your butt hurt and your jimmies rustled.<br /><br />You&#039;ve gotta decide where to draw the line and cut your losses.<br /><br />Sounds like now. Take that 75%, transfer it offsite, and sell the btc for cash. Go buy something IRL with the money. Don&#039;t forget to save your receipt.

				Sounds like you have had a run of bad luck, or selective scamming. <br /><br />Maybe create a new account, buy from really reputable sellers for a while, until your stats pack enough punch to be able to state your case in any future disputes.<br /><br />I have only had one exp of being sent the wrong drug (2cb instead of 4acodmt), I cant for the life of me remember the vendors name but he was a complete gent about it and then sent me the correct order.<br />

Take responsibility for yourself.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sorry to rain on your pretension (despite me thinking you mean well), but I&#039;ve been scammed many times in the past. Lucydrop seemed like a reputable vendor by all accounts- but I finalized when I received tabs and they ended up being bunk, no reship; and that was two orders- one for a friend. Once ordered Ecstasy pills from a 300+ seller, 98% positive, again one order to me and one to a friend (in a completely different part of the country)- never received either order, 50% refund on each. Ordered 3 LSD candies from a 99% positive seller, 300+ transacs, different country from non-arrived X pills; package never came, 50% refund.<br /><br />This time around I mistakenly ordered LSB (listed under the LSD section) as my eyes missed one letter. But then, after the item was shipped, the seller told me it&#039;s not LSB- it&#039;s LSV. Eventually we came to a refund agreement and the seller told me that they were retesting the tabs (I doubt it).<br /><br />Perhaps you still perceive this is all my fault, despite the double deception. Regardless, I&#039;ve decided to be more responsible with my bitcoin and just ordered some incredibly expensive tablets that are from a very well known, cleanest LSD, top-end seller- it cost an arm and a leg but I&#039;m dying for the real stuff.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">You ordered was told what the mix up was so you could&#039;ve stopped and made the vendor cancel from there but nope you went along with it used the drug then complained now should you get a refund definitely NO</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Did you read? The package was already sent before I was told it was LSV. There was literally nothing I could do until the resolution center came up.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Geez, I kinda wish you didn&#039;t go into detail because it makes you look even more like a fuck up than I thought. Own up to your dyslexia. <br /><br />You ordered LSB thinking the &quot;B&quot; was a &quot;D.&quot; OK. Honest mistake. But it&#039;s your mistake. <br /><br />Why punish the vendor for your error? 100% refund? Are you for real? <br /><br />You were looking to score LSD but chose the wrong listing (LSB). That the vendor didn&#039;t send you LSB which you mistook for LSD, but instead sent you LSV is almost immaterial since it was your original dyslexic fuck up that put you in the situation to begin with.<br /><br />You&#039;re both in the wrong. You fucked up picking the wrong listing. He fucked up by sending you other then what you wrongly picked.<br /><br />If I were SR staff and saw this thread I&#039;d rule 50% refund. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been here for almost 2 years and never once scammed and haven&#039;t lost money either. Well over 100 transactions. Spent 5 figures. What am I doing right?<br /><br />Like thagoat said, time for you to get off the road. You&#039;re doing it wrong. <br /><br />Seriously. <br /><br />I&#039;m being serious. This isn&#039;t Amazon or eBay. Vendors are risking their freedom selling things on here that you probably couldn&#039;t ever get your hands on IRL. You have to own up to your fuck ups. Stop the transference. <br /><br />And no, you didn&#039;t rain on my so called &quot;pretention.&quot;&nbsp; The way you keep getting scammed says you&#039;re bib dribbler who wets himself. Figured as much so I donned a HAZMAT suit and re-breather before entering the thread. ;)<br /><br />You kids... I swear to the gods below, you&#039;re going to be the death of this place with your feelings of self-entitlement.

				Too simple. (and it says you didn&#039;t read the OP carefully enough).<br /><br />Let&#039;s go with your paint example. Wife tells you to get indigo, but some how you order blue. But you come home with red. <br /><br />Who fucked up? <br /><br />You did and so did the merchant. <br /><br />So you both must take ownership of fuckupidness. You wife wanted indigo, you ordered blue but got red. Had you bought indigo like your wife said and that can was red inside, then your overly simplified example would have merit. <br /><br />I like a SR where everybody takes personal responsibility for themselves. Hence, he&#039;s entitled to no more than 50% since he too fucked up.

				Like BenJesuit says, they both fucked up and 50% should be a fair deal. 75% is a great deal.<br /><br />If he had ordered LSD, the item was shipped and the vendor then messaged him saying &quot;Sorry but this is LSV&quot;, a 100% refund would be fair because then it would have been the vendor&#039;s fuckup. In this case, the buyer was looking for LSD, thought he bought LSD where the listing said LSB. That&#039;s his fuckup. He&#039;s actually lucky the vendor then sent LSV instead, because that&#039;s the only reason he should get anything.<br /><br />If you are looking for heroin, you don&#039;t order from a cocaine listing. He was looking for LSD and ordered from an LSB listing. The fact that the vendor ended up sending him LSV is just an extra fuckup, but the buyer here obviously keeps the focus away from the fact that he is the one that fucked up first and that they both fucked up. Resolution staff would probably rule 50% taking everything into account.

There&#039;s something fishy here.

If you try the product to see what it does, you accept that product. If the product is something you don&#039;t want you have no reason to try it. When the vendor contacted you telling the product was something else you had two options: A) accept it (as you did) anyway or B) say to the vendor that it was not what you ordered. If you do A then you cannot blame the vendor the product is shit because you ACCEPTED that product and you practically then signed the acceptance by trying the product.<br /><br />To the TC: you have been given 75% refund that it&#039;s more than you deserve. Take responsibility of your actions instead of blaming others about them. IMO you would not deserve neither 50% but the vendor is kind enough to give you 75% and you even complain? For what? Because s/he did not send you LSD to begin with when YOU ordered something else for mistake without either do nothing about it? IMO you are playing the smart guy here.<br />
