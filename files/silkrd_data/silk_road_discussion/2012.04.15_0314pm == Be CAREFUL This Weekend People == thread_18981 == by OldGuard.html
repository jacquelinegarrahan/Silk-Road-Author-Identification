				With the start of the big sale only 5 days away I hope people will be careful when making their purchases since the last time we had a sale like this a number of scammers popped up and made away with a good chunk of money.<br /><br />Be VERY leery of sales from new vendors especially those who want you to finalize early as that is what helped fuel the last cash grab. Do not let greed over run your common sense as the old saying goes&nbsp; &quot;if it looks to good to be true it probably is&quot;&nbsp; especially in the middle of a big sale.<br /><br />And as always run if you see someone offering one of those lotto scams as they never seem to turn out good for those who participated except of course the seller.

				Good Advice.&nbsp; With all these sales going on it might make it harder to judge where the line of &quot;too good to be true is&quot; and where you really are just getting an amazing deal.&nbsp; Stay in escrow guys. <br />Peace

				Isn&#039;t this what the Escrow system was designed for? If things are stocked I dunno why people decide to jump out of it unless they want things like next day delivery or items are bespoke for the customer. <br /><br />All my magical powders are sold via Escrow and this shall be the same at 420 for my deals. :)

				totally agree with the two posts above mine.<br /><br />Never, Ever FE with a New seller. Let them work their way up through the ranks/stats like all the other Great Vendors have done in the past, tony76 for example.<br /><br />I could have been scammed badly by AgentMulder.... but because I refuse to FE accept for tony and perhaps a very small handful of long-timers, I got my BTC back.<br /><br />Buyers on SR NEED to READ the Forum. not every single post. but there is an on-going thread just for current scammers and Vendor&#039;s to watch out for (sketchy)&nbsp; -&nbsp; they need to do some reading/homework on the Vendor they want to place an order with. Read all their Feedback on their Vender page and read up on them on the Forum, either search their name or read whatever Thread their product is listed under. I&#039;d love to know how many lazy bastards don&#039;t even bother with these simple things. I don&#039;t know about you, but the work I do to make a living/money is not the kind I want stolen or scammed off me.<br /><br />

				yea be safe everyone. remember stay in escrow (form the looks of sales a lot of people are waiting for the sale to order). also dont order form too many vendor to same address. may set some flags off if out of the blue you get a ton of stuff sent to you.

				This is great advice. The only stress a buyer should suffer is the little bit of BTC they might lose because, while they STAYED IN ESCROW, BTC fluctuated against them between the time they ordered and had to get their money back through resolution. <br /><br />The only people who should lose money this sale weekend are the scammers who paid for a seller account to no avail.

				Sure - it would be unwise to push the boat out too much and always stay in Escrow unless a reputable seller states that he or she needs you to finalize early. (new customers may have to do that in some instances)<br /><br />To be honest getting 15% or even 25% off is great and I might stock up on some E as you tend you not be able to keep good MDMA away from people as you want to share! Coke on the other hand. Mine. All Mine! I might get a half gram just for a Friday night amusement session. Get drunk and use coke just before you feel like going home. Try for some consensual dirt. End up confined to the man room. Hate it when that happens. <br /><br />I am hoping to try out some new things at the sale and build up the festival kit so I can really let things go a little with a variety of things to help the ebb and flow of social gatherings and the odd little bit of one on one special time. A grope on the dance floor perhaps. <br /><br />LSD maybe. It comes to a time in your life when you might want to do it properly. aged 18 its fun but aged over 30 it can be more fun and you can play with it.<br /><br />Roll on the sale!<br /><br />Bitcoins on the way!<br /><br />I just want to win this special holiday.&nbsp; I could do with a sunset in paradise and a nice meal in a nice hotel by a nice blue sea shimmering in the sun. Of course an after dinner joint would be in order. I would savour it on the beach on some secluded spot. Or in the hotel room with the wet towels by the door. <br /><br />So let me win please and I will hug you big time. Me love you long time. Platonic-ally-ish. No way am I going to let you love me in a manly style akin to porno disco early 80s gay men on meth type of porn! Saw a documentary on meth in the gay scene. Gays always get the best drugs which is why I promote my women being friends with gay guys in work. Great parties. Get my bum pinched a few times but worth it for a snort of coke and half an E and weed and hash. I&#039;ll be stripping if the good coke comes out. Any port in a storm. Who would not get their bum pinched for a bit of free drugs? I guess people had a lot worse done and would look upon bum pinching as harmless fun. In the UK its sexual assault with malicious intent. Well - they should snort some E and STFU.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;m the victim but not complaining! wish it was women pinching it but sexual equality for all and (cough) any more of that coke left?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />&nbsp;;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ::)

				you should allways stay in escrow and not FE, even with reputable seller. There&#039;s Been many reputable sellers who started to scam: HM, GJ, CFMF, paythepiper are a few that come to mind. Odds are there a lot more i did not list. It just i dont follow a lot outside of the coke vendors just know about paythepiper b/c it just happen like 1 week ago or so and was post all over the forums.&nbsp;
