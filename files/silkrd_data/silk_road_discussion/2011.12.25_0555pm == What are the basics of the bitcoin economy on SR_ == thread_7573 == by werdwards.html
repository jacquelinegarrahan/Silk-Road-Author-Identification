				For example, let&#039;s say I buy 5 bitcoins when they were valued at 3.25. I now have 16.25 in bitcoins. The value of bitcoins go up to 4.00, so I have 20.00 in bitcoins. What difference does this actually make? When the value of a bitcoin increases, does the bitcoin price for a listing on SR decrease?

				Vendors can choose to tie their price to bitcoins (rare) in which case it will cost the same amount of bitcoins regardless of the exchange rate; or vendors can tie their price to the US dollar. In that case the price of the product is always the same in dollars but you have to spend different amounts of bitcoins to purchase. In your example, you would be able to buy more product with your bitcoins after a a rise in value.

				Firstly sellers can chose to tie products prices to USD or Bitcoins, in the former if the value of bitcoin changes then price (in BTC) will fall or rise but the USD price remains constant. Silk road do offer the ability to just set a certain cost in BTC and let it stay at that regardless of BTC changes, I can&#039;t see any reason for a seller to use though.<br /><br />So yes, for pretty much all items you are right, if the value of BTC in USD rises then the listing price will decrease, this can be good if you buy BTC then in the hours of transferring it to here and then it&#039;s worth more meaning you can either get more for your money or sell the left over.

				[quoteI buy 5 bitcoins when they were valued at 3.25. I now have 16.25 in bitcoins. The value of bitcoins go up to 4.00, so I have 20.00 in bitcoins.][/quote]<br /><br />werdwards...you&#039;re really close. The amount of Bitcoins never changes. In your example you will start off with 5 Bitcoins and even as they go up, you will still have 5 Bitcoins. It;s the Value of each Bitcoin that changes.<br /><br />Buy 5 originally@ 3.25= $16.25<br />The 5 go to 4= u will have a total vakue of $20<br /><br />If those BC went to 50.00, tiy would still have 5 BC&#039;s, but value would be $250

				This is a really interesting thread, especially for those of us that are quite new.<br /><br />I assume with BC at over $4 at the moment, they have gone up in value...I am just assuming that.<br /><br />So do people tend to get the BCs when needed, or buy a load as they may be going up in value?

				IMHO, If one was smart, You could send in a Money Order every month for X amount of dollars and gather BC&#039;s as though they were nuts. If you can be disciplined Not to spend too much, you can watch your nuts eventually grow to 6 -7 dollars per BC.

				Well..BC may seem Gay. But there are lots of potential dealing right Now trying to make BC very much involved involved with Credit Card Transactions. It&quot;s a waays away and CC Companies may Not want to deal in Bitcoins, but may eventually have to due to security and fraud. The 100+ BC I bought in early December I got for 2.33 a piece. Now at 4.20+...I gues I&#039;m happy with alll the Gayness of it

				It&#039;s from a Christmas carol. Don we now our gay apparel. Fa la la la la. They sure were happy back in the day. :P Is it wrong that btc turn me on? I feel so dirty.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe that anyone fully understands the btc economy or any other complex economy for that matter. People can make educated guesses and sometimes they&#039;re right, but there are just so may variables, interdependencies, and unknowns that even the smartest economists and fastest supercomputers can&#039;t accurately predict what will happen. It&#039;s kind of like predicting the weather. Unless you know the positions and energies of every molecule in the atmosphere, it&#039;s impossible to predict with 100% accuracy. A small updraft might become a tornado or just a big cloud.<br /><br />Our emotions play a big role too. So you can&#039;t just rely on some fancy equations to figure everything out. If people feel the economy is good it will tend to get better and the opposite is also true. It&#039;s almost like a living organism. Even the folks in government who are supposed to know what&#039;s going on don&#039;t have a clue most of the time and just try different things to fix the problem until one of them hopefully works.<br /><br />Someone said it&#039;s the volume of trading of btc or any currency that drives the value up. I said demand for btc was driving the prices up which is related to increased trading volume.&nbsp; The trading volume will likely go down this month after the holiday season so the value should also go down. That is my prediction which is probably as accurate as someone with a degree in economics. Because they don&#039;t know what the fuck is going on either, otherwise our economy would be fixed by now.
