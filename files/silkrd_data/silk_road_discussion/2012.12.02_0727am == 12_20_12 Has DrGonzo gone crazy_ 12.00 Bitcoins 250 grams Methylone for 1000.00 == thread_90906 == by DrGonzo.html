				anyone here get a China pack from DrGonzo (DRG0NZO) before?&nbsp; I&#039;m curious if there is any stealth or if they just seal it up and send it along.&nbsp; PM me you&#039;ve gotten one of his China packs if you don&#039;t mind. Very tempted to order the 250g of m1 even though I&#039;ve never used used m1 before.&nbsp; Thanks.

				I would love to hear from others that have bought bulk from him.&nbsp; Most of the feedback is that orders went bad but that it was probably due to a fuck up from the Chinese not him.&nbsp; All feedback was 5/5 that he rectified the situation but one of the 5/5 was that it never arrived and he got a 50% refund.&nbsp; Unless it got caught by customs I don&#039;t think a 50% refund is fair.<br /><br />I do have experience receiving packages from China.&nbsp; The size of your town doesn&#039;t matter in the US everything comes through one of the large customs centers.<br /><br />He seems like a great vendor and the sale price on the 250g looks very nice but the feedback is concerning.&nbsp; It also isn&#039;t routine for Chinese to use very good stealth and packages are more likely to get caught if you&#039;re on the west coast.

				The whole point to the name &quot;molly&quot; was that it was just the MDMA hcl molecule with minimal impurities.&nbsp; Really sad that bk-MDMA is getting sold as MDMA.&nbsp; I assume the synthesis is similar anyway so now that bk-MDMA is illegal it doesn&#039;t even make much sense.<br /><br />Selling one drug as another drug is a very not cool thing in my book.&nbsp; I love MDMA, but one person said that they were able to use methylone more frequently than MDMA without building up the same tolerance.&nbsp; For that reason I&#039;m interested in bk-MDMA aka methylone aka m1.

				He is around :) he is very busy! He takes weekends off (he should!) and he is a bulk vendor so he has lots of big orders to fill.<br /><br />If you&#039;re patient you will be very happy with DrG. And if you have to wait a little longer for coin he will make it worth your while!
