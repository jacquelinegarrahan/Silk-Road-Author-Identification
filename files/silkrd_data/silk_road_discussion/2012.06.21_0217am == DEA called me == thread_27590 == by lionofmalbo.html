				Ok so I bought some stuff off of silkroad obviously not legal. So, I get a call from the DEA and heads up from some close friends that they were coming. They started asking me questions about the my mail. For example why was you name misspelled? What was in the package? ect. So, he asked me if I could set up an appointment the next day I told him no, that i could do 2 days from now. So, what do I say what should I do. I am calm now but I know Im going to be shitting my pants when I go and actually stand in front of them. Should I lie, ask for a lawyer, tell them the truth???

				Tell them you have no knowledge of a package.<br />Stick with the story that you have not ordered anything and that you certainly could spell your own name right.<br /><br />If things get rough, ask if you are free to go. If they say no followed by anything, demand to speak to a lawyer and say nothing else.<br /><br />Keep in mind that they can lie to you and will try to catch you in a lie.<br /><br />Honestly, I&#039;d tell them that if they had any questions for me that they could speak with my lawyer.<br /><br />How large of an amount of &quot;x&quot; did you order?<br />What schedule drug was it?

Call back and tell them something has come up. Then ask what the meeting is about and ask if your lawyer should attend as you are being questioned by authorities. Tell them you do not wish to speak with them if possible and that if they have legal questions that they are to be handled by your lawyer. <br />2. Go to the appointment, deny knowledge of a package, request a lawyer if things get out of your control. Do NOT incriminate yourself.<br /><br />At least these are what I would do.<br />Whatever you choose to do, do not incriminate yourself, keep a lawyer in the back of your head.<br /><br />If we are talking about an oz of weed or anything I wouldn&#039;t worry. If you ordered a kilo of molly however... The drug/amount does have an impact.<br />PM me if you do not wish to say anything via the forums.

				You NEVER go to the police head quarters to answer questions without a lawyer PERIOD. If they had anything on you they would have kicked in your door by now with the warrant, its they&#039;re job and how they get they&#039;re rocks off. If this did happen and you go there, they&#039;re going to try and pin something else on you. If they call back, respectfully tell them that when they have a warrant for your arrest they can come and pick you up.

				The DEA does not make house calls on personal amounts and ask you when would be a good time to talk about a package that has your name misspelled. I would call psyops but srsly are the donuts that satisfying that they are worried about your little personal stash of narcotics and were wondering when is good for you to chit chat about the proper methods to smuggle your weekend supply?<br /><br /><br />:)<br />nomad

				Nomad is right, DEA don&#039;t call.. they will just break down your door and arrest you if they have enough evidence. I received a call someday from someone saying he was an investigator and wanted to talk to me.. he told to me he will recall for an appointment but he never did..

				Yeah it&#039;s really weird that you said they called. How did your close friends know they were coming?<br /><br />If they really want you to go in and chit chat then the whole point would be about trying to get you on their turf to intimidate you into singing. They love that shit. They&#039;ll make up all sorts of BS like how you&#039;ve been rolled on, they&#039;ve got the goods on you, you&#039;re going away on federal charges for X amount of years, if you tell them what you know the courts will be lenient, if you agree to play nark they&#039;ll let you skate, all sorts of fucking bullshit. in fact anything they can think of that they think will make you talk.<br /><br />Don&#039;t fall for any of it and you can start by blowing off your appointment. Meanwhile, I&#039;d be spending my time finding a decent lawyer to rep you.

				Buddy something about this post just does not add up and I often wonder just how many&nbsp; 15 16 yr old get on here making post just to read responses. At any rate I believe the best policy is to assume it is real than assume it is fake.<br /><br />First off the DEA or any other LEA picks and chooses very carefully who they approach. Once they approach someone&nbsp; then they have shown their hand&nbsp; and the&nbsp; suspect now knows he is being watched and then the suspect tells his friends and the house of cards goes in every direction.&nbsp; &nbsp;So like a poster asked how much and of what did you order&gt;?<br /><br />If you had a couple keys of number 4 Smack and some keys of fish scale&nbsp; sent to your door than maybe they might want to talk to you but I am guessing&nbsp; &nbsp;if they did approach you they have been tailing you and watching you for some time as&nbsp; the old&nbsp; lets sit down and talk jive only works when they have some kind of leverage&nbsp; and I can tell by your questions you are probably someone who would fold under pressure and&nbsp; that two is a reason why they&nbsp; approach&nbsp; certain people.<br /><br />For real just call and cancel your appointment and say you did so on advice of your&nbsp; lawyer. Make sure to call a lawyer and ask some questions in case they ask you who your lawyer is that base&nbsp; is covered. you do not want to get caught in lies .&nbsp; Be polite and respectful and explain you are not trying to be an ass hole or rude to them but you&nbsp; ar just following your legal counsels advice and let the machinery take over.<br /><br />if you follow any rule at all&nbsp; it is keep your&nbsp; mouth shut. With gilligan MUM was the word with you it needs to be ATTORNEY.&nbsp; anything they say to sscare you just let go in one ear and out the other. ok. for real.. <br />

				Just my opinion, but even if someone made a thread saying:<br /><br />&quot;DEA randomly came up to me on the street today and asked if I had heard of SR&quot;<br /><br />Or something ridiculous, we should take each thread here seriously to some aspect.<br />I&#039;ve seen numerous &quot;bust&quot; threads and all are attacked for being trolls.

Yes, some probably are, but the ones that aren&#039;t may be one the ones holding crucial information that we must know.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed.<br /><br />Most of the trolls here are just not very good at doing it, not even subtle sometimes. Don&#039;t they get that eveyone here is above average intelligence, that it&#039;s almost a pre-requisite to being able to use the Silk Road?<br /><br />To troll Silk Road effectively, you&#039;d have to build up the trust of everyone on the forum, over a long period of time. Then, you wait it out til the perfect issue comes up to try and discourage people from carrying on. You &quot;leave&quot; the Silk Road yourself to prove your point and hope that people who trust you (whose trust you&#039;ve abused) will follow you.<br /><br />Watch out for this brand of trolling, it will definitely be more effective than this current bout of transparent nonsense
