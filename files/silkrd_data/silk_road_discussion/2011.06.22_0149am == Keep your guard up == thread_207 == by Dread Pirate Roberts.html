				Hi everyone,<br />Things are going really well here.&nbsp; There are many new buyers and sellers working well together, our servers are secure and humming along, and you may even start to feel comfortable.&nbsp; DO NOT get comfortable!&nbsp; This is not wal-mart, or even amazon.com.&nbsp; It is the wild west and there are as many crooks as there are honest businessmen and women.&nbsp; Keep your guard up and be safe, even paranoid.&nbsp; If you buy from someone without reputation, get to know them really well through pm, and even then be suspicious.&nbsp; Unfortunately it only takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch, and there are bad apples out there.&nbsp; We&#039;ve received some threatening messages and just want everyone to stay alert and careful.

				Thanks for the heads up SR. Personally I don&#039;t do business with anyone without feedback, and even once feedback is established I&#039;m wary because there are people faking feedback. That&#039;s unfortunate that you&#039;ve been getting threatened though. Has it been LE or just angry sellers who want to be able to scam?(if you don&#039;t mind me asking, that is) Good luck and keep fighting!

				Im going to be a new vendor. How do I get positive feedback If no-one is supposed to order unless they have some? Its like the chicken and the egg.. AM I going to have to &quot;give&quot; something away first? I would think that by using escrow that everyone is somewhat protected. What do you suggest I do?

				@j789745: The whole site isn&#039;t a scam, but many of the users are. It doesn&#039;t offer an escrow service like SR does, so it&#039;s much easier to scam. There are also people using fake identities with the usernames of reputable sellers from SR (although these should be pretty easy to figure out via their public keys). I wouldn&#039;t write the site off completely, as they may expand their security/safety features, but be really careful. You&#039;re not just giving away your bitcoins. You&#039;re giving your address to a stranger!

				&quot;This ain&#039;t Amazon or EBay, this the wild wild west.&quot;<br /><br />I think this is a really good way to put it.&nbsp; While sitting in front of your computer at home, you can start to think you are safe.&nbsp; But you are buying illegal things on SR.&nbsp; So it&#039;s probably very healthy to be a little paranoid when doing business on here.<br />
