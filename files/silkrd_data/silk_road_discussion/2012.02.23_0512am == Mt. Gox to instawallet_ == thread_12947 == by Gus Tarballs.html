				Hello all I am new and have been lurking the forums for a while. I have researched much but had a question about instawallet and BTC. I plan to do the Chase cash deposit from buybitcoins but was not sure about how Mt. Gox fits into all of this as I have seen others mention here. Can I not simply have buybitcoins trasnfer the converted bitcoins directly into a instawallet and skip Mt. Gox altogether? <br /><br />Also, the only websites I am supposed to use Tor on are this one as well as instawallet, is this correct? I understand using Tor on Mt. Gox, Dwolla and getbtc is a mistake?<br /><br />Thank you in advance kind sirs.&nbsp; :)

				I used bitinstant and that gave me a mtgox code, which i redeemed and then I had to buy the bitcoins.&nbsp; Be VERY careful using instawallet.&nbsp; Bookmark the wallet with your BTC in it, and make sure you dont click on ANYTHING before doing so.&nbsp; I clicked the FAQ and before I knew it I had a newly generated blank wallet.&nbsp; I had to dig through my history to find the account with the BTC in it, so thankfully I wasn&#039;t using tor at the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />So pretty much the flow is like cash -&gt; mtgox credit -&gt; BTC -&gt; instawallet -&gt; SR<br />Not sure how buybitcoins operates, but if they themselves are a wallet and give you credit in BTC instead of dollars/mt gox coupon codes you shouldn&#039;t HAVE to use mtgox.

				There is no need to go through MT Gox if you have already obtained btc, but for many MT gox is the way they obtain them.&nbsp; As for Instawallet, it works fine when transferring from MT. Gox, as some have said they have had problems with Mt gox --&gt; SR. A better step may be to go through a mixing service such as bitfog to better obscure your btc.
