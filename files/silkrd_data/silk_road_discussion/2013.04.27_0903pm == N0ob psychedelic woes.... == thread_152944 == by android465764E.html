				I&#039;d be grateful if someone could offer a bellend&#039;s walkthru on a couple of points..<br /><br />As a reference point, I&#039;ve tried LSD a few times and I rather enjoyed it.<br />I&#039;ve also tried DMT and I absolutely hated it. <br /><br />I was browsing the psychedelic category on SR and tbh, I&#039;ve not even heard of about half of the items listed.<br />I&#039;m keen to try new things though, and after reading some reports on 25i-NBOMe, I&#039;m eager to try this next.<br /><br />But, can someone please explain how it differs from LSD? <br /><br />Furthermore, what&#039;s the difference between 25B-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe, 25D-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe? (ÅŒ_o) <br />Presumably these are all branches from the same tree, as it were? <br /><br />Then there&#039;s the &quot;2C family&quot; and the others below - 5-MeO and 4-AcO, with different letters after.<br /><br />As you can tell, I&#039;m a bit lost. lol Are some of these RCs? *clueless* <br /><br />In the first instance, I wanna try 25i-NBOMe because I&#039;ve read a lot of reports that mostly seem to be very favourable, and it&#039;s much cheaper than LSD.&nbsp;

				I know very little about the 2cs and DOs etc but I know some people seek them out instead of LSD, either because they like it or it&#039;s cheaper.&nbsp; On the other hand, dealers may sell it and call it &quot;acid&quot; so they can make 10$ a hit on it.&nbsp; The effects feel different, and in some cases the trip can last much longer.&nbsp; I know this has happened to me once or twice, and the only &quot;test chemical&quot; I perfer is LSD.&nbsp; The fact that it&#039;s available on here, from my point of view, eliminates the need to fuck with any other chemicals.&nbsp; Again, I have little experience with this except for the times an unidentified chemical was sold to me as fake acid.

				All these 2-CE and 2Cis and NBOME-whatever the hell&#039; and about 100 more really wasnt around when I was a teenager. I do remember them being called research chemicals back in the day by but never had the urge to try them to be honest. I mean WTF is it? Ive heard good things and Ive heard some not so good things on them potency wise. I know there are alot of different families and they all seem to have very different effects on people. Ill stick to my tried and true girl lucy anyday of the week... Gotta get at least one good trip in a year just to clear me out.... Just buy quality LSD period

				i would recommend trying 2c-b instead of 25i. 25s are very similar to 2cs, but the negative physical effects seem to be amplified in the 25s. 25i is cheaper than lsd for good reason. i took a strong dose and it just felt like &quot;knockoff&quot; lsd to me, very uncomfortable and &quot;plastic&quot; feeling. i pretty much just felt like my visual cortex was frying. it&#039;s kind of like lsd, but without any real depth. it&#039;s a purely recreational drug, but wasn&#039;t fun for me at all!
