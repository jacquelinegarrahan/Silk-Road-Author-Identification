				Ahoy,<br /><br />I have spent the past few days working nearly around the clock to create a new forum and website to replace SR.&nbsp; The forum is up now, at http://blackiiw5nozs6i5.onion<br /><br />The new Silk Road is in open beta.<br /><br />About security:<br /><br />The site is being programmed completely from scratch, with a completely new frame work not based on any potentially bugged code.&nbsp; Security is the number one goal, and as such I will most likely release the source code and offer prizes for hacking the beta site.&nbsp; The servers that run both the forum and site are encrypted and inaccessible without a key that is stored solely in my head.<br /><br />I have addressed the &quot;honey pot&quot; problem on the forum.&nbsp; There is also a section for site suggestions.&nbsp; I am designing to site to match the style of the previous SR.<br /><br />Lets get back to ship shape.<br /><br />-MDPR

				Why do you have to register just to read the forum? Harvesting much?<br />The site is being programmed? You mean coded? <br />Bragging about forum members. Wow. Fuck off dude. Show us your sites source code or fuck off. Why not use BitWasp?<br /><br />

				Ahoy,<br /><br />I am very pleased to announce the open beta has officially started.&nbsp; Here is what to expect; only a few vendors are registered right now.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry, many more will be adding items over the next few days.&nbsp; There are most likely some bugs still in the code.&nbsp; I have done my best to squish all of them, but I can&#039;t promise I have gotten the all.&nbsp; The website is not as refined as it will be, and I am still adding features.&nbsp; In other words, this is not a final website, and you should not expect everything to work perfectly.&nbsp; There is a section of the forum where you can post bug reports and feature requests.&nbsp; Use it.&nbsp; Only message me if you have found a bug related to site security.&nbsp; If you wish to apply as a vendor you can submit an application here: http://blackiiw5nozs6i5.onion/index.php?topic=103.0<br /><br />And now, what everyone has been waiting for, the link to the new Silk Road: http://ajd4yqq7ngzmqo3p.onion<br /><br />We have lowered our sails and turned our backs to the wind.&nbsp; This is the beginning of the next great voyage.<br /><br />I want to personally thank all the closed beta testers.<br /><br />-DPR
