				Dear All:<br /><br />I do love MDMA for its loving empathic qualities (best empathagen), that heart-to-heart, caressing verbally and physically, just-have-to-kiss-you, I love you, you-are-such-a-beautiful-being, effect. <br /><br />Is there anything else out there like it? Any other empathagens? Please share your experience with any. Thanks to all in advance.&nbsp; :)

				Thanks. I heard that 2cb is Shulgin&#039;s favorite. <br /><br />I suspect that MDMA is one of kind, so I hate to go bumbling about trying to find a substitute.

				I find Foxy (5-MeO-DIPT) pretty sensual and sexual at the same time on a pretty unexplainable level if you take a proper dose. 2c-b can be sexual but I find sex on 2c-i/e much more fun and engaging. I find myself tripping to hard on 2c-b to really get into anything and the body load is a huge turn off. Give Foxy a try with someone and I can tell you the conversations are endless especially if there is physical contact then it becomes an unexplainable experience.

				There are many, one I want to mention is MDAI because it&#039;s still available legally in many places. You get a bit of a mood lift, feel more relaxed and emphatic, and this without stimulant effects so your head remains clear. Pleasant little substance, doesn&#039;t feel &#039;narcotic&#039; if you know what I mean.

				After hearing you, I&#039;m interested in 2cb, LSD and Foxy (which I&#039;ve never even heard of). Thanks. I will try to find more information about them. I&#039;ll be especially interested in information like cross-tolerance with MDMA as I plan on trying to maintain the magic for as long as possible by using it no more than every four months (takes some will!). <br /><br />BTW: Slicksuit that&#039;s some impressive good Karma you have!<br /><br />

				5-MeO-MIPT is much smoother than 5-MeO-DIPT.<br /><br />2C-B is also good, as if GHB.<br /><br />Mescaline (low dose) + GHB goes into a delightful empathic space...<br /><br />BG

				lol well, in my opinion, the closest substance ive found to mdma is 4-fa.<br />it requires a slightly higher dose, but is very empathogenic and euphoric. more so than the cathinones thaat are around in my opinion.<br /><br />*EDIT*<br />and not to be an asshole or discount any of the other posts, but a lot of the other substances mentioned are quite a bit more &quot;serious&quot; than mdma....<br /><br />for example the 2cs, or the doxs, or lsd, etc.<br />thats all a little bit beyond empathogenic and more leaning towards entactogenic(reaching the god within)<br /><br />the 5-meo-mipt is decent in the empathogenic area, quite a gentle substance.<br /><br /><br />4-ho-mipt was both empathogenic and entactogenic for me.<br />it was highly spiritual, AND very loving and social at the same time.<br /><br />but with all of the more serious stuff considered, i still highly recommend 4-fa as an mdma replacement.<br />its the closest thing to it that ive seen listed on here.

				My favorite quote about 5-MeO-DIPT by dkmonk. I love readng this. Id imagine 5-MeO-MIPT is even better&nbsp; ::)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=33008.msg404079#msg404079">Quote from: dkmonk on August 12, 2012, 05:50 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">OMFG Foxy (5-MEO-DiPT) is the best shit I have ever had that went with sex. Not only does it make you feel like your body is going to orgasm from every touch, but when you thrust it sends tingles all over your body like you just shot up some good meth. It makes your partner look like they are glowing with beauty. The girl I was with was already good looking but this intensified to where she looked like a Greek Goddess, and when I say glowing I mean it literally it looked like she had this unwordly glow of absolute perfection. I fucked the whole night long, and it made me such an animal! I was doing and saying things I never thought I would say, it totally unleashed any inhibition I had in me. I probably got off in her at least 5 or 6 times and the orgasm is so powerful you feel like it can&#039;t get any better or you might just pass out.<br /><br />To anyone who thinks I am exaggerating I am not at all if anything this is an understatement. I don&#039;t exaggerate you can look at my reviews I give on here. Hands down the best sexual experience and 2nd best experience of my life! It makes the elixir of sex meth look like a boner pill. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=33008.855&nbsp; :)

No, thx...for now.

Thanks. Good Karma on you. -- mmm, karma.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Regarding 4-FA there&#039;s a page with some info about it (maybe more than 1, but I know of this one) - <br />you might wanna check it out: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7350.msg65874#msg65874<br /><br />also the link down that page to a clearnet website can give you lots of info...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I will check out the links, thanks. Have you tried it? <br /><br />Anyone else had experience with 4-FA?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was looking @ it... but then I did some more research...<br />since I tried a lot of RC many years ago and almost none of them really had a &quot;waow-effect&quot; I&#039;m not really fond of trying another one, especially when such &quot;!!!****!!!&quot; are being posted about it...<br /><br />Is it information or desinformation, I don&#039;t know - but there are enough products out there that will do (approximately) the same to you and where the effects on the human body are much better known and understood. Personally, I&#039;d rather stick to those than try some more RC&#039;s... but, to be honest, my mind could change if I find some more research on it/info on it... <br /><br />It&#039;s all about: &quot;how much damage are you willing to endure because of the experiences you want to have&quot;... and then: &quot;what experiences do you really wanna have?&quot;... Psychedelics are great and most of them have been used for ages (mescaline, ayahuasca, iboga, &#039;shrooms) those products are worth my time, effort and &quot;damage&quot;... but an RC (4-FMA in this case)...? No, thx...for now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />4-fa and 4-fma are two different substances friend. might want to make sure you are looking into the right substance before you bash it.<br /><br /><br />***AND 4-fa was shown to NOT destroy serotonin in the brain in rats. although its rats, the information usually translates.<br /><br />in 6 hours, the rats brains had returned to normal levels.<br />sounds much more safe than mdma to me in theory, even though its not as well known.<br />
