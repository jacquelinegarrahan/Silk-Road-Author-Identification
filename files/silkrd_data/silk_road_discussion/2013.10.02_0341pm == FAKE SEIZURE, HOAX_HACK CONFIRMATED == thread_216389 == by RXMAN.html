				Just called and got some information, this is not anything the US Government is doing, when i read the seizure notice they critiqued the US Legal Code, 18 983 J is for protective order of intellectual rights seizure, not 18 us 982 which is for criminal seizure. <br /><br />after looking at the image closer too it appears they stole part of the logo from the bitcoin exchange seizure notice <br /><br />http://forexmagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lr-website1.png

				It is NOT fake or hoax.<br /><br />They were able to have foreign govt do a live image of the (or one of the) running SR web-servers including all PM&#039;s, listings and transaction records. They do not need to keep site running. <br /><br />Ross was arrested YESTERDAY. Kept site running another day after arrest.<br /><br />Forums might be LE run right now, yes.

				Well from my knowledge the site does not appear to be taken down by DPR, or the Feds. But possibly by someone who collaborated with the Feds, whoever made the graphic spent hours making/Photoshopping it and was waiting to post this image up right after DPR&#039;s arrest was made public. Also from what i can tell they raided him last night. also from what i can tell the servers are still running.
