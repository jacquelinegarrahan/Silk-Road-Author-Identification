				Just curious what everyone&#039;s take is on this.&nbsp; I &quot;think&quot; the way the &quot;best selling&quot; sort feature works is if a vendor (let&#039;s use Vicodin as an example) has been selling for a year here, there product is bumped as the best selling, even though it isn&#039;t currently what the best selling product is (just has more sales due to the length of time the listing has been open).&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the best selling product should be what is selling hot now, not what has the longest history.&nbsp; I know there is no way in hell Vicodin is at the top of every product he sells, but he is always listed as the &quot;best selling&quot; or one of on all lists he has products listed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Am I wrong in thinking it works this way?&nbsp; I&#039;m not bashing Vicodin, just using him as an example.&nbsp; If tetravort were to come back, without any sales, would he be the &quot;best selling&quot; coke vendor immediately?&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t make sense to me.&nbsp;

				The sort by bestselling option has been broken since the upgrade in a lot of sections, if you click on the items and look at the feedback you&#039;ll see that items with zero sales are showing as bestselling items.

				Yep, I sent a note to vendor support about it the day of the upgrade and they said they knew about it and were looking into it.<br /><br />Not sure what is causing it, in the shrooms--&gt;spores section it is sorting from oldest vendor to youngest vendor.<br /><br />I wish they would get it fixed but I really don&#039;t know the back end so I am not sure how hard it is to fix. Seems if it is php with a back end sql database it should be as simple as a <br /><br />SELECT column <br />FROM table <br />WHERE var&gt;X<br />ORDERED BY var<br /><br />However that statement would be for a very simple sql database and something as complex as SR would more than likely require a much more complex query.<br /><br /><br />You also have to think that they have had their hands full the last couple of days with the whole BTC exchange problem.

				Also, anyone notice the &quot;domestic only&quot; option not staying selected?&nbsp; Everytime I click a new category, it goes to international vendors, and the domestic button is unclicked.&nbsp; Frustrating considering how slow SR loads.<br /><br />
