				I&#039;ll start by saying I&#039;m pretty new to Silk Road, only have a few transactions under my belt, and really just looking for thoughts on how to handle one transaction. <br /><br />I placed an order last week from a vendor here with an impressive rating, sent details via PGP, as far as I could see everything was as it should be. The problem is, the order is still showing as processing and is now only hours away from the cancellation option being available, and I&#039;m not sure why. <br /><br />A couple of days after I ordered, a dropped the vendor a friendly line to see if they got my order okay as it still hadn&#039;t been marked as shipped, but am still yet to get get a reply. I understand sellers here must have a heavy workload, so I&#039;ve only sent that one message since placing the order, but not really sure where to go from here, any ideas?<br /><br />Being new I&#039;m keen to build my rep so don&#039;t really want a refund/cancellation showing on my stats, especially as I&#039;m still good for the order and&nbsp; would like to prove myself as a long term trustworthy buyer. <br /><br />tl;dr&nbsp; I understand the whole being my a new buyer means the seller might be wary or whatever, but does zero response yet no cancellation from a seller seem out of the ordinary?<br />

				This has been a difficult month for myself and several other quality vendors I know...&nbsp; &nbsp;seems like the shit just hit the fan for the past few weeks for almost everyone I know really so for me its been a month of playing catch up all along... I have alot of unanwswered PM&#039;s and I worked filling orders this weekend just to try to get caught up and Im still packing orders right now at 9pm at my office.<br /><br />See, us vendors dont have a crew of people working on your orders, its just typically one person...&nbsp; I just cant justify turning over anyones personal shipping information to anyone else to help process the orders, even though I know plenty of very trustworthy people that could do it.&nbsp; So, its a trade off of security and piece of mind for a time delay inconvenience at times.<br /><br />Next is the question:&nbsp; to pack orders *or* answer PM&#039;s?&nbsp; Well, since its just me I have to pick one or the other, I cant do the two things at once.. So I pick getting peoples orders out then dealing with whatever pm&#039;s I can get to later...&nbsp; its not a perfect system... thats just how it is.<br /><br />So, if your order is with a well known reputable vendor and in escrow you have nothing to worry about, Im sure youll be taken care of as soon as possible...&nbsp; If you cant wait any longer, cancel the order or if the cancel button is not available yet pm the vendor with the subject &quot;CANCEL MY ORDER PLEASE&quot; and Im sure they will take care of that for you...&nbsp; you can also catch some vendors live on SILC (see instructions in the off topic forum area)<br /><br />Paperchasing

				I am in exactly the same situation right now brother - I had just placed an order with some other vendor and because they were out of the product they cancelled my order which I know looks bad (i would like to strangle this vendor - all i got was - sorry haha oopsie my bad :(<br /><br />The vendor I have placed the order with maintains that they never go beyond 24 - 48 hrs to ship and its been 3 days so Im starting to get a bit pissed off. If I have to cancel this order as well its going to look terrible - There should be stricter regulations on vendors to prevent this kind of thing - Ill keep watching this thread so let us know how youre going : )

				As far as I know, cancellation of an order during the processing process, either on your side or theirs, does nothing to your stats. It&#039;s only when you hit resolve while your order is in transit will it potentially look sketchy and ding your stats.<br /><br />This is how scam buyers work, they just claim their order never arrived when it actually did and ask for their money back.<br /><br />If you constantly kept cancelling orders you might be perceived as indecisive and maybe a pain-in-the-neck but how would a vendor know you kept cancelling unless you kept ordering from the same vendor over and over?<br /><br />If your order is taking too long, cancel it, send them a nice message as to why you&#039;re cancelling and place another order with someone else.
