				Hello ,<br />I have been open on SR for nearly a month now , as i cannot FE until i have 35 transactions, I have been refusing to sell to any one who does not have perfect transaction history.<br /><br />&nbsp;It feels a bit tight saying no and refusing&nbsp; to process their orders , but i am a business .<br /><br />&nbsp;I am right in thinking once i have done 35 transactions for customers like these i can ask them to FE ?<br /><br />Is it normal to get messages promising big buys if i send them a sample?<br /><br />&nbsp;I sent out samples at the start just to verify my products, now i have 12 completed orders with 100%&nbsp; score<br /><br />So surely if they were unsure about my integrity they would read my feedback.<br />&nbsp;Anyway thank you for taking the time to read this .

				No you are not wrong if you decide to to work with problem buyers, unfortunately there are a number of less then desirable people on SR and we have all read about them on here. You have to do what you feel most comfortable when it comes to your business and cash flow, for every problem buyer you reject there is another decent buyer who will come along.<br /><br />The single biggest scam on SR today is &quot;Give me a free sample and I will buy more&quot; as they never come back with money. If someone actually had money to place a big order they would not think twice about making a small purchase to check out your product, service and stealth shipping methods before making a big buy. If someone says gimmie gimmie gimmie they will NEVER make a buy from you.

				Thank you guys ,<br /><br />I get a lot of &quot; I am the biggest buyer on SR so send me a sample &quot; messages and a lot of&nbsp; customers with less than perfect stats. As a new business starting out I have to be extra careful who i serve. Just feels harsh turning an order down . <br /><br />&nbsp;I have already lost 2 oxy 80 mg to this guy who said he would sample and review , this was before i was open on SR, sent one said he never got so gave him benefit of doubt and sent another one , never again , <br />I have sent over 20 packages and not one has gone missing and that was to the tougher countries , so i think he is just a sample scammer which is a shame as he was very pleasant in PM . It does not surpise me though . <br /><br />Is it true that some people just go on here to beg for samples ? with no intention of buying anything. <br /><br />On the other hand there are a lot of wonderful caring buyers out there and I&nbsp; have made many good contacts.<br /><br />&nbsp;Long live SR .<br /><br />Kind regards <br />RP

				I understand the dilema of free samples new customers and FE.&nbsp; &nbsp; Just recently made my first purchase and had to finalize early for 3 grams of H&nbsp; . I went of the forum and seller reviews&nbsp; to try and minimize a chance of problems .&nbsp; &nbsp;So now i just have to sit back and wait for my product with one&nbsp; order from asia&nbsp; &nbsp;and the tracking number im still waiting on with the other which is on the way from the netherlands&nbsp; i guess.

				It is your fundamental right as a seller to be able to refuse to sell to anyone you do not wish to sell to no matter what their sales stats. It may be silly to exorcise this in the extreme but in the context you are giving you are being wise.

				You shouldn&#039;t take any less precautions selling here than if you were street huslin&#039; . Even in real life there would be customers that you wouldn&#039;t want to sell to because they seemed sketchy or something just wasn&#039;t right. Eventually you might have to loosen up a little to help grow your business, but for a new vendor, caution is a key aspect of success. You don&#039;t want your vendor ratings being trolled by people leaving bullshit feedback. Requiring all to finalize early though may cost you some legitimate customers over time as a lot of us who have been here a while, and have establish buyer credibility, just refuse to deal with anyone requiring FE. Too many scammers in the past, too many &quot;trusted&quot; vendors going rogue, and no one likes floating money to strangers with no way to get it back if it ends up falling through.<br /><br />The best way I can sum it up is like this. As you vend, work on building up a web of trust between yourself and solid customers. Once you do you will have more leeway in requiring finalization but you will also find yourself being more willing to cut some slack to your best customers as you see them throwing steady streams of cash at you on a regular basis.

				RP<br />I did the FE for newbies after I got to 35 sales but stopped cos a guy gave me a 1/5 review.<br />He/She had terrible stats so I politely asked them to FE before I sent.<br />They agreed but not politely and then left a bad review and a 1/5, could be a coincidence I guess (not).<br /><br />Bottom line is unscrupulous buyers can find a way to screw you FE or not.<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t ask for FE and to be honest have had very few problems.<br />There&#039;s a few dicks out there but by and large people are very cool.&nbsp;

Please, for the love of all that is holy, don&#039;t get yourself tied into the FE trap. I state in my policy that buyers with little history or negative history to please contact me first. I sate I will ask for FE from newbs but I rarely actually do. I get their packs ready like I would for anyone else and then inform them of such and that they have the option to FE. Their responses give them away pretty quick if they are trying to pull something. But in general asking for FE makes the whole escrow system we have here for both parties&#039; protection rather useless and will leave a bad taste in the mouth of any legit buyers who get caught in the FE trap. On my buyer account I am 2 packages received out of 7 ordered where I had to FE when I was still new. And these were from buyers who had decent &gt;95% feedback. Of course their feedback was full of FE, with no updates...<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35703.msg407720#msg407720">Quote from: real pharmaceuticals on August 14, 2012, 12:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is it normal to get messages promising big buys if i send them a sample?<br /><br />I sent out samples at the start just to verify my products, now i have 12 completed orders with 100%&nbsp; score<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>As others have pointed out &#039;sample beggars&#039; are not uncommon.

				Hey everyone,<br />Thank you for our all kind advice , All i want to do is a provide a professional service with an emphasis on quick dispatch.But in the same vein I am a business not a charity and want do everything through escrow as i feel that is what makes SR so successful . <br /><br />&nbsp;I think i will just avoid new customers and bad stats , is that ok to do ? even after 35 transaction . <br /><br />There are plenty of good buyers out there , never before have i been made to feel so welcomed into a community such as this&nbsp; and&nbsp; i look forward to getting many more people , not just buyers . <br /><br />&nbsp;I seem to be getting begging emails on a daily basis . Sometimes think if i refuse they may go bad mouth on forums somewhere and put other customers off, but that just me thinking overtime.<br /><br />Thank you everyone&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;:D

				I hear you. It really is tough knowing what to do. I take most orders because I think the majority are good on here. Maybe that newb will become a great relationship down the line. The price of that is not filtering out the person who causes you grief. The sample beggars must be asking many many vendors for samples. I imagine it would be hard to single out one vendor to trash on the forums. The crowd here gets the perils and knows how it is. If someone trashed me because I wouldn&#039;t offer a free sample or if I were being feedback blackmailed I believe customers who have dealt with me would say, &quot;hey, that&#039;s not how this vendor treated me!&quot;

				real pharmaceuticals,<br /><br />You are the seller and can say no to anyone you want. Tell everyone to fuck off if that is what you want! <br /><br />As far as people asking for samples, forget it I say.<br /><br />If they are the biggest buyer on SR then one tiny purchase is nothing to them. If you want you could take that first purchase price and add it as a credit when they buy a huge order.<br /><br />Bottom line is you do what you want. This is not walmart or ebay. <br /><br />Rock on.

You have the personal right to refuse service to anyone for any reason with or with out explanation. <br /><br />Simple as that.<br /><br />Now as a vendor I am here to sell. I process more transactions then I deny. that is the point, but I refuse orders. I refused a guys order one time because I DIDN&#039;T LIKE HIS NAME. Hows that for some shit? Once I decrypted his info - I didn&#039;t like like the look of his name. I really do not recall it, but it just didn&#039;t feel right. I canceled him.<br /><br />I DO however deal with new people every now and again. Everyone has to start at the beginning right?<br /><br />And finally as far as the &quot;send me a sample I want to try and then I will buy 100000000 pounds if it is good!??!&quot;<br /><br />Obvious scam is obvious.<br /><br />I handed out samples when I started vending. I will do a sample give away again someday, just to give back to the community, but I&#039;ll be damned if someone is gonna talk me out of one red cent and then disappear into the night. Deny all these requests, as politely (or not) as possible. <br /><br />I told one guy &quot;no&quot; to free samples and then he mailed me 3 more times after that....all but begging.<br /><br />Fuck that.<br /><br />We will see if any of those &quot;Sample Beggars&quot; read the forums ....... I said in another thread the next time someone starts trying to beg samples off me. I&#039;ll be polite and honest and tell them &quot;no&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they ask a 2nd time I&#039;ll act like I changed my mind (I&#039;ll even pay for shipping) and then mail them dog shit. Literally. Dog shit. <br /><br />Now that would be awesome.<br /><br />I digress.

				Hello everyone,<br />I do not want to be mega big and regularly turn away orders for 20 plus tablets. AT the moment i am trying my best to establish myself as first class vendor on SR, thinking about doing some bud as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;So far my customers what i have served have been good buyers. But for everyone 3 i process i turn away 1 . <br /><br />I think just like when dealing on the street , instinct is a big influence on my decisions to sell to someone.<br /><br />So if i have a bad feeling about something is always pays to be cautious , but like mentioned above am i turning away potentially good customers ? everyone got to start somewhere.<br /><br />&nbsp;I think i will be less cautious once i have reached those stripes at 35 trans.<br /><br />Thank you for all your advice. Have nice day <br />Kind regards <br />RP

Be honest and offer any constructive criticism you may have.&nbsp; Keep in mind that samples are generally coming from new vendors who are learning their craft.

I gave away 10 samples. I even included shipping. Priority shipping. I didn&#039;t really know WTF I was saying.... I mean I had my security all down, but I was not thinking &quot;You just gave away 1oz+ of mushrooms....and now you have to spend $62.50 out of pocket..just to ship!&quot;<br /><br /><br />Plus all my packaging materials - which if you have ever seen one of my orders...they aren&#039;t that cheap. And also the $150 out of pocket to become a vendor. <br /><br />Point is I was hundreads of dollars in the hole and giving away good product in hopes that 10 people I have known for all of 2 sentences would give me the feedback I needed to get started. <br /><br />I figured even if 50% (5 people) never said another word to me - then I would still have 5 feedbacks. MOST (like 7 or 8) of those people were TOTALLY awesome! some were betters expressing themselves then others, but I got positive reviews. In the end all 10 hooked me up, but I had to wait (what felt like way too long) for like 1-2 of them.<br /><br />I had created a listing just to gain feedback. I charged these guys like .25 cents. (because I thought I had to charge something for the feedback to stick)<br /><br />....the 1 or 2 I am talking about.... it took them like a week to finalize! I was like LOL WTF!<br /><br />I wouldnt mind if it happened tomorrow, but being brand new on here as a vendor EVERY feedback counts!!<br /><br />Point is - do your part (like I am sure you will) If it is a new vendor that is doing samples - get him his feedback QUICK! Even if you start by only rating his packaging and a &quot;look&quot; of the product. If you can&#039;t try whatever it is for a couple days....say that in the review or feedback...and then once you DO the sample......SAY IT!!! <br /><br />lol<br /><br />you see the other thread about peoples feedback being &quot;5/5&nbsp; FE - will update&quot; and then they never do? Yeah - dont be that guy.<br /><br /><br />This has become more a public service announcement then just a reply to TFB!

				As a relatively new user, thank you for the advice ShroomMeister.<br /><br />Just hanging around forums I have learned several things over and over. <br /><br />1. Never FE for any reason.<br /><br />2. PGP any and all private info.<br /><br />3. Read feedback and consider when it is &quot;5/5 FE&quot; over and over again. (If I were going to FE, why not 1/5 until transaction works out and update later? Not only would that encourage vendors to stop requiring FE it would also not require an update if product never comes. Honestly until product arrives any transaction should effectively be 1/5 anyway! Also if a vendor requires FE that should knock a point off the review anyway in my book. (FE = 4/5 max in other words.)<br /><br />4. The resolve process is robust and fair.<br /><br />5. As intimidating as all this seems at first, with a little patience, time, and positivity there is nothing to it.

I actually trust them a bit more tbh.<br />just ignore the hate and do your thing.

				Hey what&#039;s up guys, i was just handling a fuck ton of resolutions and went through a whole lot of attempt scams. But because I used to ship with tracking you could clearly see the item had been delivered.<br /><br />Is there any scammer list somewhere? I cant even keep track of the attempted scammers anymore. <br /><br />Also; don&#039;t these fuckers know i&#039;ve got their address? Why would you attempt to scam a drugdealer who&#039;s got your goddamn address. I&#039;m just pissed off because I recently started shipping untracked from Germany, and i know im going to lose a whole lot of turnover because of obliged policy refunds. <br /><br />Im just thinking of like; becoming a stealth seller or something with a small bulk clientele. Over 85% of my profits is from bulk, small listings are just intended for users to have a good time and enjoy themselves with quality product, but all you get is headaches and a bad temper. And believe me, I have the temper of a saint when answering 200+ pm&#039;s a day, but jesus christ does it run out sometimes. Time is as a valuable commodity as money, and I got bitcoins and money coming out of my ass with 0 time in the week to enjoy it. If i would stop doing small orders I would spend 60-75% less time on orders every single day. Which is hours and hours. These people really encourage me.

				Your not wrong, I agree w/u ST. I&#039;m pretty new but from what i see about your profile your a popular mofo, I can imagine the frustration of not not to be able to enjoy RL all the time. I&#039;d just go stealth and do 1000+ orders. I ordered from you 8 days ago and was wondering about that &gt;&quot;how can you offer refund/re-ship with no tracking to confirm?&quot; Very noble but dangerous. GL man!
