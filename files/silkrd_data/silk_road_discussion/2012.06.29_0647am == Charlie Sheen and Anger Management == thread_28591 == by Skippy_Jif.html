				This show just doesn&#039;t match up to 2-1/2 Men. I like my Charlie Sheen as a drunken playboy with no significant understanding of the value of a dollar(excluding hookers, drugs and booze) that gets into inescapable shenanigans only to come out cleaner than a freshly baptized alter boy after being sodomized by a priest.<br /><br />I guess the actor is only as good as the writer. If this show doesn&#039;t drastically picks up some sleuthing whore mongering material it will fail. Call me old fashioned, but I like my Sheen as a rich-predictable drunken asshole than a guy who is a shrink coaching others through their dilemmas while learning a valuable lesson on the side. That&#039;s SUBJECTIVE!!! <br /><br />HOW IN THE HELL CAN THIS SHOW ESCALATE TO SHEENS POTENTIAL IF HE IS CONSTANTLY IN CONTROL OF HIS ANGER ISSUES?!<br /><br />Charlie Sheen needs to fire his publicist and get back on coke! He probably has list his connection when he bad mouthed the creator of 2-1/2 Men. <br /><br />Suggestion for Sheen:<br />Scroll on down to my sig and check out my vendor page. I have enough good blow to get you back to your &quot;Winning&quot; persona. Then you will eventually go broke and end up sucking the executive dicks over at the 2-1/2 Men set to get back to where you belong!! I&#039;ll be rich and you can continue making me laugh as before.<br /><br />And that is what really Grinds My Gears.

My friends use the word Sheen as a code word for Coke round their Mrs because they have all clocked on to what I&#039;m talking about when I say Bing. I feel that him playing someone normal is just making this word kinda false now tbh. Sheen.....you let me down son.....get back on the CRACK!

				I&#039;m going to email him an invite to the Road and suggest he buy from me. <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry guys, I&#039;ll have him back to normal by the 4th holiday. Or dead. Either way I&#039;m sure a marathon of 2-1/2 Men will be in the near future.
