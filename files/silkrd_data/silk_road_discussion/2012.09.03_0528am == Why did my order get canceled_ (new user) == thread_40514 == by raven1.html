				I have no idea why my order was canceled by the seller (painrelief). I live in Canada. He&#039;s in Canada and ships to Canada or USA. I wrote my address properly. Do I need to PGP my address? I just wrote my address in the address box. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m a new user. I don&#039;t have a history yet. I sent him a message asking him why he canceled, but i haven&#039;t heard a response yet. <br /><br />Any insight would be helpful.<br /><br />PS. This was for Percocet.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				You should always GPG your address in the address box when placing an order, o my !<br /><br />Most vendor&#039;s will ship to ppl who put their address in plaintext, but that&#039;s because it&#039;s no risk to the vendor, the buyer is the one who just put his ass on the line writing his address in plaintext&nbsp; ???<br /><br />You&#039;re best bet is to send him a PM and if he doesn&#039;t reply then just chalk it up to a loss because he clearly doesn&#039;t want to do business with you (and that&#039;s his right, with or without logic).

				My bad. I didn&#039;t realize that was the protocol. I&#039;ll send him a PM and see if he responds. Thanks.<br /><br />Everyone was a newbie at one point in time.

				Sounds like he may have either run out of the product and couldn&#039;t forfill your order or he just thought your purchase stats weren&#039;t high enough for his liking and wasn&#039;t prepared to risk you being a possible scammer (I&#039;m not saying you are&nbsp; :))

				Relax on the guy...no need to make him panic..no pgp is just fine. How many did you order?<br /><br />I think that the best thing to do if you are new is to contact the vendor BEFORE you place an order to him explaining that you have read his vendor page and you understand his rules and that you would like to order X. Also explain that you will finalize the order as soon as you receive it.<br /><br />And more important then PGP is FE(finalize early). DO NOT FE....NO MATTER WHAT. That is the only way you can get screwed. If you do not do that you can not lose your money.<br /><br />The vendor id busy this weekend and I am sure he will get back to you. But if he does not then just move on.<br /><br />But try what I told you earlier with the next vendor it should work.<br /><br />Good luck
