				I am not one to come to the forums to ever knock a vendor, EVER. I felt it necessary. I understand Afterhour has always had his policies FE or track your shipment. I chose not to tract and he sent me a message 4 after my package was marked in transit. Said that I needed to FE because I didnt want to track it. I agreed and said his policies were silly.<br /><br />It has not been 12 days from germany and his listings are down. I have never lost a package in 63 tries from reputable vendors. So afterhour are you this mad at me or are you using your way out cause I didnt FE early. <br /><br />man up and get me my good brother<br /><br />you know my stats... im an HONEST man

				to me it seems as if he was doing to much of his own coke...<br /><br />&nbsp;he made a mistake on one of my first orders and told me he would add some pills the next order. the next order i remembered him about that but he didn&#039;t send them and told me he hadn&#039;t read that.<br /><br />next order i write him again he tells me that he never had said that to me and deletet his pm in which he wrote that to me.<br /><br />after that i wrote him what his problem was, it would have been just pills worth maybe 20 dollar. <br />the next message was i should fuck myself and never order from him again...<br /><br />funny thing is that i have read quite similar story now a few times about him.
