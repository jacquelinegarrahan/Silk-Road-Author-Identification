Go from Bitinstant to MtGox and then exchange your dollar for BTC there. Then transfer your BTC to SR. That way you know exactly how much BTC you are getting.<br /><br />And the OP is right, the exchange rate is 122 when all the major exchanges are around 125-126 right now. It should be updated.<br /><br />Also I wonder what method DPR even uses to calculate the actual USD value of BTC. Weighted averages from a couple exchanges? He should let us know how it works.

				You will ONLY see the exchange rate if your account is set to Dollars. So I would assume member above is set in BTC still..<br /><br />A live rate on SR would be a TOTAL NIGHTMARE! Just ask anyone that has been here over 1.5 years..<br /><br />Also I know that 122 has been there for a while...don&#039;t forget it is a 24hr weighted average... and in the last 24 hours it has been under 122. And it has been at 125 for only a few hours...<br /><br />Of course there is always a chance something is broke.. BUT just like the 4,778 post before this on the EXACT SAME THING....everything will be working fine.<br /><br />Also OP... I know unlike most of the post before you....you were noticing it has been at 122.15 for a long time yet btc has moved..<br /><br />Anyone that is reading this thread...please check out Wiki about the BTC rate and do even more homework to try and understand the btc and the rate on SR vs Mt.Gox.&nbsp; When you do....you will soon realize this is the BEST option as of now. And it actually works great!<br /><br />Good Luck!

				MtGox uses a 1 day average. From my observations it seems like SR does it&#039;s averages based on a longer time frame. My guess is it is to combat fluctuations even more.

				@ moon...I assume you don&#039;t need the micro loan anymore? I messaged you back to see if you still needed something and I didnt get a message back so I assume no ;) (i&#039;m pretty smart ;) )&nbsp; But I also wanted to publicly say thanks for the return of micro loan..I DID get the .02 back or whatever it was... You are right I sent you the wrong amount .003 instead of .03 and then after I realized I was wrong you sent it back to me! I think even more though it was so small I could not see it.. So again I am sorry I sent you wrong amount and thanks for sending it back. Your &quot;credit&quot; is good with me anytime and I promise next time to actually give you what you ask for!
