				I posted this over in Tech Support but I figure I would get a much faster response here....<br /><br /><br />More details here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=33219.0<br /><br /><br />To sum it up.<br /><br />Paid 354 Bitcoins for an order, had about 16 remaining in my account<br /><br />Vendor realized he had more than he thought(I wanted more than he thought he had at the time), so he canceled the order and relisted me a new one. <br /><br />I notice my money is incredbly off so I look at my transactions, and I was only refunded 339 Bitcoins by SR. This left me with 355 bitcoins in my account, when the refund should have left me with around 370BTC. I am missing around $130 worth of bitcoins!.<br /><br />Where did they go?<br /><br />Does anyone have an idea of what happened? Just have a looksie yourself!@ The order was never marked in transit to my knowledge, and it still says my refund rate is 0%<br /><br />refund&nbsp; &nbsp; transaction #cc5525a7e7&nbsp; &nbsp; ฿339.16&nbsp; &nbsp; ฿355.92&nbsp; &nbsp; July 30, 2012, 8:21 pm UTC<br />purchase&nbsp; &nbsp; transaction #cc5525a7e7&nbsp; &nbsp; ฿-354.34&nbsp; &nbsp; ฿16.76&nbsp; &nbsp; July 30, 2012, 5:23 pm UTC<br />

				The order was hedged. Basically the value of Bitcoins went up while the order was on hold, so when you get a refund you get less back, because if they give you the exact same amount back you would end up with more money.<br /><br />It does make sense, don&#039;t worry, you haven&#039;t been robbed. Your bitcoins should be able to buy you the exact same amount of product as before, assuming their value hasn&#039;t changed again.<br /><br />Think about it like this, if you had $100 and bought some Bitcoins, and got 10 Bitcoins, then bought some drugs, but the order cancelled. Now after waiting 4 days for it to cancel $100 will now buy you 5 Bitcoins, meaning each bitcoin is worth more, you wouldn&#039;t expect to get the same amount of Bitcoins back would you? Otherwise you would be getting free value. You could scam the website if they did this.

				If the refund was hedged correctly, then I should have recieved even MORE bitcoins in the refund considering their value depreciated. Yet, I recieved even LESS than I paid, inspite of the DROP in BTC Value? <br /><br />That is not how hedging works

Sucks
