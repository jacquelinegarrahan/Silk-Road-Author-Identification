				Hi Roader´s!!<br /><br />Just back from vacation I used my last C (after a break of a week) to estimate the real &quot;value&quot;. Than I wanted to update my feedback - it´s not possible anymore!!<br /><br />Vendors now got what they already wanted for a long time, we buyers CANNOT CHANGE OUR FEEDBACK ANYMORE!!!<br /><br />In this case I wanted to add a very positive feedback, but there were already opposite situations when I wanted to change feedback to negative!<br /><br />How the hell could our &quot;new Dpr&quot; do that!?<br /><br />It seems, the highest value for &quot;new Dpr&quot; and co. is NOW only MONEY, no more ethic!!<br /><br />The buyer´s interests aren´t important anymore, only the (fee-paying)-vendor´s interests are&nbsp; in their sights!<br /><br />We buyers on SR need to be more careful than ever before!<br />We have been disarmed recently!!<br /><br />If you finalize at the moment you get your stuff (as the vendors request), you don´t have the time to test the material some time later (working people need to wait til weekend and longer st).<br />...and most important you can´t change your feedback, if it is not as expected!!!<br /><br />So, how should other buyers know the truth about feedback, if you cannot write the truth, Dpr?!<br /><br />When the changes were made, the only voice that was heard was the vendors voice, very poor and very sad!<br /><br />&quot;New Dpr&quot;, what do you plan next, FE for all?? No more refund?? When you get a package your order is fulfilled, no matter what´s inside??<br /><br />SHAME ON YOU &quot;new Dpr&quot;, what you made of this place is like the world-economy handles:<br />The only thing that counts are $$$!!!<br />...and don´t come along with the phrase &quot;you´re responsible for your actions&quot;.<br />I´m really pissed!!<br /><br />&quot;OLD DPR, WHERE ARE YOU, WE NEED YOU BACK ON THE ROAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				Why would you order drugs if you were not to try them until much later? Also depending on the drug you have reagent tests. The vendor should have his money released as soon as you have your package. He has succeed in deliviring it to you, and is not his fault that you have to take a long time to test it, why would he have to wait for his money to be released, because you cant test it right away?

				Wow, the OP seems to be having a bit of an aneurism over a rather trivial change to the rating system. So now you can&#039;t change feedback after, boo hoo - fact is that is fairly neutral as (like you said) it means they can&#039;t be updated positively as well as negatively.&nbsp; You can still leave a rant on the forums if you feel you were scammed after you&#039;ve left feedback, and the fact is that there are probably far more, and much better obfuscated, scammer-buyers than scammer-sellers, as there are far more buyers and opening a buyer account is easy and free.<br /><br />Calm down and smoke a bowl. We are all still free to express ourselves here, so scammers will still be exposed. I do not see this as any great tragedy...

				the feedback system needs to be overhauled....i wish they would make the ratings in .1 increments so sellers only received a 5/5 for perfection but still could get a 4.6-4.9 for a wonderful transaction which still makes them look really good, as well as i think the feedback should be able to be changed for up to 72 hours after the transaction has been finalized, yes i know for some products you cant do right away but you should be able to find time if you ordering this shit to use it or test it out within 3 days, i understand some scum bag buyers will go back in time and used to change feedbacks from months ago to try and score free product so i know why the change was made but we need some sort of grace period cause sometimes i do leave the feedback and i try everything and i want to change and make the feedback more positive cause everything exceeded my potency expectations, i dk i doubt it will ever come to that but it would be nice , and i swear this is like the 10 thread i have seen today about feedback issues and wondering what the SR staff is doing, im sure there working hard at it, or maybe smoking some ganja idk but either way im hoping in a week or so this all goes away

				Like someone else said before, you didn&#039;t get how it works the rating/feedback system.<br /><br />You can finalize as soon you receive your package, and than when you tried it, rate and review the products. It&#039;s not bad at all.

				just because you finalized doesn&#039;t mean you have to give your feedback rating or review right away.&nbsp; that option will stay in your order page until you hit submit feedback.

				Is it just me or does anyone else get annoyed when people try to say that DPR&#039;s motivation is only money?<br />&nbsp;He has done so much for this community that doesnt help out his wallet in the least bit. Do you know how much he makes or had made already without any of the modifications he made? Me either, but its a boatload of BTC. He is probably set, he just wants to better this project and make the community an all around smoother and fair experience for both vendors and customers.

Buyer stats have been around for pretty much the whole time SR has. They have weight to them. It seems that you just want someone to argue with.
