				Clearnet::<br /><br />http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/10/08/did-the-nsa-help-with-the-silk-road-investigation/<br /><br /><br />The NSA could possibly have played a crucial part in this investigation and it simply didnt wind up in the official crimanal complaint.&nbsp; Its called parallel construction of evidence hiding more grey area data with semingly concrete detective work which just so happens would not have been possible without help of the grey area eveidence. These include project XKeyscore and their invesigations into tor. There must have been a dialoge between the deptartments that is not completely in the light. <br /><br />Clearnet:<br />http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document

				Anyone who thinks this case was &quot;good old fashioned detective work&quot; and that the NSA was NOT behind the SR bust is living in a dream world. The NSA feeds information to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies, but those agencies never report the NSA as the source due to the classification of the programs that produce the data for the NSA.<br /><br />Tor hidden services are traceable. People here don&#039;t want to believe it, but until we see a compelling reason how the FBI located SR servers and the Freedom Hosting Servers, everyone should assume that a .onion site can and will be traced by U.S. agencies.

				Isn&#039;t it hilarious how most of the US still believes that the NSA is only spying on everyone for reasons of national security? The DPR story is so incredibly unbelievable that it just might be true, but that&#039;s not to say they aren&#039;t using these techniques to locate other people that are of no threat to national security whatsoever.<br /><br />As technology continues to evolve, surveillance like this is only going to increase. Even if the the NSA locates &quot;common criminals&quot; passively, it&#039;s still a frightening prospect when you consider just how flexible the definition of a criminal can be. Just look at how many individuals or groups inexplicably fall under the classification of &quot;nation security threat&quot;.

				George Orwell will soon ne rising from the dead to start the zombie apocalypse. Fuck the U.S. I LOVE my country and would fight and die to protect my freedom and that of others worldwide. But that is not what the U.S. is about anymore. All they want is to suck every dollar they can from the least fortunate to give to the rich one percent even with some that some even say &quot;I don&#039;t/want need a tax break.&quot; Our Congress and (not just Presdent Barak Osama, not a typo) care more about how they look on C-SPAN and at their fundraisers then they ever will about those that need help the most.

				dont start on those taxes, being somebody who makes income from capital gains, it is necessary because of the money put in, they pay the same as anybody else but working is taxed higher than money from assets, because assets involve a large investment and if the govt taxed capital gains the same, nobody would invest. most people pay a few hundred to a few thousand in taxes, people with more money would be paying millions, including the millions in investment. People who work do not give anything but time in most cases, so taxes are higher.
