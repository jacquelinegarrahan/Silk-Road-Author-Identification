				Hey everyone, so sometimes when I try to access the roads main site silkroadvb5piz3r.onion&nbsp; it&#039;s unable to connect. So what I did was use the SP search engine in the top right hand corner of my browser and search for the site. I clicked on the first link that said silk road login and the url is silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to .&nbsp; It connects every time without any problems. Does anybody know if this is a fishing site? The only difference in the URL is the &quot;.to&quot;. I&#039;ve logged in multiple times and I&#039;m kinda paranoid!

Similarly, if you access onion.to with TorBrowser then they won&#039;t know your real IP address either. It just means you&#039;re being routed through two different Tor nodes, the one your TorBrowser is currently using and the one the onion.to site runs you through.<br /><br />Sorry if that&#039;s a bit unclear, I&#039;m severely sleep deprived at the minute!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />- grahamgreene
