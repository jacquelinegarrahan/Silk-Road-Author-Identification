				Sad day. Not a hoax or BS.&nbsp; (Ongoing updates made to end of this post)<br /><br />****<br />ASSUME they have control and have imaged Forum server also. Forum is still up to gather intel, see reactions, and follow chain to backup plans. Possibly. Sort out your business ASAP. Assume will go down at any time. If you send any clear PM&#039;s on main site or here with sensitive info it in hands of US FEDS and by proxy foreign services. <br />****<br /><br />WE NEED ASAP:<br /><br />Place we can goto to discuss or for update if/when this forum goes down.<br />(Temporarily added forum section at BMR if needed: http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewforum.php?id=29 )<br />Archive to be made of this forum ASAP if anyone have access so the knowledge can be brought back later if taken down.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />Like we say many time, they investigate for many months/year before action taken. Investigation seem to lead up to finally get live-image of server on July 23. <br /><br />July 23,2013 - SR Main servers (or live load balance of) was live-imaged by foreign gov&#039;t and given to FBI.<br /><br />May 24,2013 - July 23,2013 - 1.2 Million PM&#039;s were sent and feds have them all in clear text. That is only the period they analyzed for the indictment.<br /><br />DPR tried to setup murder for hire for the guy threatening to divulge names/addresses awhile back. (FriendlyChemist)<br /><br />DPR was identified by posting to a clearnet forum in 2011 with his gmail address that was linked to his google+ account with picture and favorite you tube videos that he has posted about here before. Picture matched his linked in profile and included references to SR that be apparent to somebody investigating him. <br /><br />His posts about economics and links he posted were all included in his google+ profile etc. <br /><br />It is that simple. <br /><br />Also in June 2013 seem somebody clearnet signed into SR server from hotspot in San Francisco, CA, USA. <br /><br />He used his gmail address which was firstrealnamelastrealname@gmail.com to signup at shroomery, <br />Used his real e-mail to&nbsp; post on stack overflow asking for coding help with PHP and tor. <br />Had his real picture on all of the profiles connected to gmail, used clearnet IPs to login to google services which they obtained form google.<br />Posted you tube videos of himself and his friend with plans to move to CA, USA. <br />Ordered fake ID&#039;s which were seized by customs with his real picture. Mentioned SR during 1st contact with border protection re the fake ID&#039;s. <br /><br />Just. WOW.&nbsp; :(<br />------------<br />**UPDATE**<br /><br />CA Case # 3:13-mj-71218-JCS Filed 10/02/13<br />Current Attorney : Brandon Michael LeBlanc (Public Defender)<br /><br />Next Action: 10/04/2013 09:30am (PST) in Courtroom G 15th Floor, San Francisco, CA USA<br /><br />Bail hearing, lawyer update.<br />(CLEAR) http://i.imgur.com/IzwO0Xu.png<br />***************<br />Reddit member claiming their BACKUP BTC ADDRESS WORKED JUST NOW.

Summarize and update info in 1st post from others also.<br /><br />KEEP THREAD TO INFO ONLY. Utopian discussion about how they should not do this and other topic not clutter THIS thread please!<br />

				Shroomery.com gave out IP of DPR&#039;s post there back in 2011. Either compromised or by request. It was a TOR ip, but if any of you think is smart to post on shroomrey via clearnet.<br /><br />Notice the important information how they discover servers is not in document. Only the how identify him police work stuff is.

If vendor was LE then that is different problem.

Ulbricht has been charged with engaging in a money laundering and narcotics trafficking conspiracy as well as computer hacking.
