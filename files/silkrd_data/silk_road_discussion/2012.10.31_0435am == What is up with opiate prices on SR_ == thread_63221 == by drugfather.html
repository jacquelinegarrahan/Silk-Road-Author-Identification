				Seriously, the opiate prices on silk road are almost FORTY TIMES of that paid on the street and damn near ONE HUNDRED times the ACTUAL cost of the pills (even without insurance!)<br /><br />Why is this so?<br /><br />Why are people so greedy? <br /><br />And why in the hell do you people pay these sorts of prices for them?

				&nbsp; &nbsp; Its a market just waiting for a king pin to show up and make everyone else lower their prices. Its a free market and if people will pay outragous prices, than sellers wont lower them. The only thing that will change the prices is more sellers showing up and offering lower prices and pretty soon it will look like the mdma market is on here now!

If you can get them for a lot cheaper and you can devote your time to it (as in you are able to it) why not do it? I&#039;m a full time student in post-grad school so it&#039;s extremely hard for me to do it.... If I had the free time, there&#039;s no doubt that I wouldn&#039;t make people pay super premium prices especially when $12 profit per pill would be MORE THAN PLENTY. (Asking any more than $15/ per pill profit is ridiculous)

Honestly,&nbsp; this site used to have good intentions but now it&#039;s just turned into a market monopoly for those who have decided to become vendors in the opiate game.<br /><br />Prices are god damn outrageous and no one can sit here and try to justify $0.25/mg of heroin and $1.00/mg of oxycodone!<br /><br />DOWN RIGHT RIDICULOUS! The people who can actually afford it, who knows how you do but you&#039;re really hurting the silk road experience for the normal user. :/

				this thread comes around all the time. it&#039;s ironic you talk about overpriced goods then go on to say you would sell dilaudid 8mgs that you paid 3 dollars for 15. <br /><br />sad fact is, opiates are expensive, especially Rx opiates, and the market is there. you can call it vendors taking advantage of addicts, or vendors following market trends, but either way the Rx dope on here will always probably be overpriced. <br /><br />hopefully a decent H vendor will come along and run the trap, bring the prices down. because the H prices are just silly. i mean oxycodone is about the same on here as the streets in some places, but it&#039;s a whole different story with heroin.

				The best opiate deal on here right now is pure fentanyl powder from a dutch vendor. he offers HCL salt form (dissolve in water, snort, etc) and freebase (my favorite) which you can smoke! it goes waaaay further than anything else for your money.

Like I said in my first post in this thread YOU ANSWERED IT! <br /><br />The truth is we/I could charge more! It is not just supply and demand..that is the main thing of course..but demand for opiates will always be bigger then the supply. Plus they pay for reliability. There are vendors with lower prices that do less business then a vendor with higher prices. This has been addressed many a time...but you must not have read those.<br /><br />YOU think the price is high..A lot of others do not. EVERY single person of course wants to pay less. Who wouldn&#039;t. But many are happy with the price. And have no problems with it. It is always the ones who can&#039;t afford the prices that complain. And I understand that. But opiates are hard to get in numbers. And the fact is the demand is huge. If there was a drug that should be lower it is weed. But that&#039;s not the case. Again for 1 reason...demand. Quality weed will always bring a premium because there will always be a demand. And the demand will come from people with money to spend. Just like there are people who buy BMW&#039;s and people that buy fords. Both get you from A to B. But the fact is people will pay for quality...nothing wrong with Ford...and some like them better then BMW...and if you need a truck..BMW is not even an option..but the fact is people will pay for something even if others say is over priced because they can afford it.Others complain how expensive something is and other say how happy they are with the price.<br /><br /><br />Not only once..but 2 times in your own thread you admit you would charge a lot for pills if you were to sell and you list the reason why...then you complain about the prices..Well the reasons you list factor in to the prices. But the truth is all of us vendors could charge more for opiates. With out question. <br /><br />Vendors are in no way taking advantage of addicts..as most of my clients are not addicts. Though some will argue we all are. If we wanted to we could all get together and list everything at $1.50 a mg and it would sell. There are not a lot of Rx vendors. And the demand is unreal. I sell the most Rx opiates a month and I sell out. I give a ton of business to other vendors. They sell out. I agree we need more vendors. But when they come they to will sell out.<br /><br />No offense but your 120 script...would not even register.<br /><br /><br />I think $1 mg is a fair price. And it seems the buyers do to. As you sad we risk A LOT. And we spend a lot of time. And we have something that others simply can not get. Where as weed,H and coke...anyone can get. What everyone wants is someone that is reliable and delivers when they say they will. PERIOD. They pay a premium for that. As that is what is the most important factor.<br /><br /><br />

				To repeat an earlier poster for me the key is reliability. I am more than happy to know that my vender will come through for me no matter the cost. Yes it hurts the pocket but the peace of mind and relief from suffering is well worth it. In my part of the universe you can&#039;t get pain relief from the medical prof without the stigma and lack of privacy that can/will destroy your career.

				did you read my last post?&nbsp; two separate statements... <br /><br />FIRST<br />as this is a thread about the opioid prices - I mentioned i am unwilling to pay one dollar per mg for oxy, so i refuse to buy them... but in response to drugfather saying he can get them for ten cents/mg others commented they would buy it at ten cents, so i replied that if could even find oxy for just 50 cents a mg i would start to buy it again <br /><br /><br />SECOND - &quot;you could make a killing&quot; (directed at the OP, not you, and not having anything to do with the first comment)<br />If drugfather can get oxy for ten cents a mg and he sold them here on SR as someone suggested for the current price at one dollar per mg then he would have a potential for a huge amount of profit... thats 27 dollars per roxy

				SECOND - &quot;you could make a killing&quot; (directed at the OP, not you, and not having anything to do with the first comment)<br />If drugfather can get oxy for ten cents a mg and he sold them here on SR as someone suggested for the current price at one dollar per mg then he would have a potential for a huge amount of profit... thats 27 dollars per roxy <br /><br /><br />So that&#039;s what you meant?...ok<br /><br />So what people were sayin..not you..people that if he sold at the current price he would&nbsp; make a killing...so basically against everything the OP stated in this thread. And proves that if people were in the position of HAVING the goods they would get the paper. Plain and simple. Doesn&#039;t make them greedy,bad,nothing but smart! They would sell for the current market rate and make a killing...not sell for .50mg and be 50% less then everyone else. That would be bad business and stupid.<br /><br /><br />I just wanted to point out that the people that complain...if they could would do the same thing if not worse. I am 100% I can raise up my prices and still sell out. Yes they are paying for the drug...but they are paying for the service..and a few bucks to them is no big deal. To each his own.<br /><br /><br />Feel bad when people can afford things..but some like micro just refuses to spend his money on pill opiads and instead went to H..smart man..more bang for your buck.<br /><br />What really killed the market is the new anti tamper pills. It raised Roxi 10 fold..also they are getting harder and harder to get. And the demand is through the roof. <br /><br />

				I would like to add my 2 cents if I may... Just like I tell my customers who asks about bulk and when I tell them my price they always reply &quot; I can get it on the street for 15 dollars&quot; Which is a LIE! Pharmacy companies even went up on the prices of within the last year also the the street price is $1 per MG!! If you can get these for cheap by all means come sell... Otherwise don&#039;t complain if you don&#039;t know the ends and outs of the business<br /><br />This is why I never cared for the Forums... Its filled with Scammers and Haters

				Although I agree with the general sentiment against high prices, I feel like a lot of what we pay for as Buyers is the anonymity of an online transaction.&nbsp; While vendors increase risk by mailing, we decrease ours, especially when it comes to the purchase of &#039;harder&#039; or scarcer drugs.&nbsp; Funneling Bitcoins is a risk of course, but one that is easier to analyze and quantify.&nbsp;

I am a vendor telling non vendors how it actually is! This is a typical case of someone that can&#039;t afford a certain drug(in this case an opiate) saying that they can get it IRL for 10 cents and would sell on here for 2 bucks....yet if you keep reading he actually say&#039;s he would sell for 15 bucks(the current price)!!! He even gives the reason being all the time,shipping supplies ect... It is all there in writing. <br /><br />I love how people come into a topic and don&#039;t read every post...yet take the time to give their opinion and it is of course not based on any facts..or what has been written before..it is just stuff they made up to sound good to themselves<br /><br />Earlier in the thread someone said they would not pay $37.50 for a 30mg...I agree..It is $29.88&nbsp; for a 30mg. Would you pay that?<br />&nbsp;Is that a big enough difference?<br /><br />And every single person that actually purchases them is happy with the price....and many would actually pay more. As is always the case with the actual buyers. Of course everyone that is on the buyer side would want lower...no matter how low it is...but the real facts are the people that actually buy the Roxies are very happy with the prices. And we happen to sell the most in demand drug with the lowest availability on here. And all of the Rx vendors are really good guys. <br /><br />When vendors leave our &quot;department&quot; for lack of a better word..they tell everyone they are leaving and give big discounts to get rid of inventory. They don&#039;t hold a sale, require everyone to FE and burn people. Not to many other drugs can say that. Take Vicodin for example. HE is retiring after being here 1 year+ he has perfect feedback and the number 1 complaint was price..yet he was the only guy! And his actual buyers didn&#039;t have a problem.Of course you are never going to make everyone happy. And for some people $29.88 for 1 pill is expensive..for others...they buy 300 at a time. TO EAT!!!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;So instead of thinking I am a vendor trying to defend my prices...actually read the post and you will see I am the ONLY vendor in this thread actually telling you how it really is from this side.<br /><br />I in no way need to defend my prices since I am the lowest priced vendor on here in Rx for opiates. Yes there are others too. I am not the only one. But I have zero complaints about price and I could raise my prices and still sell out.<br /><br />Also I am only talking about USA Rx Vendors.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for reading!

				I was pretty surprised by the opiate prices on here when I first joined too but I&#039;m actually content with them now because even though the prices are kinda high...I no longer have to cop my stuff in really bad areas and can avoid getting arrested. That was always my main worry when copping dope in the city, getting pulled over and having yet another conviction added to my record...so I&#039;m willing to pay the premium to have my stuff sent through the mail.

				RK im confused, you talk about him getting them for ten cents and selling at 2 dollars, or fiteen dollars? i think you mixed up the oxy and dilly or what did you mean?<br /><br />and just for the record - i refused to buy from vicodin as well because of the prices, but thats just my decision... i am not on here trying to complain of prices and V obviously had enough constant business <br /><br />(i did post in this thread but i was just taking part in the conversation... its your decision to list them at $1/mg and its my free decision not to buy them) <br /><br />i understand for the service provided i think it is reasonable too, especially considering some of the prices on the street before i moved and lost my connects. i just cant afford it honestly

More buyers then sellers. But they have come way down. And at the price they are as of the last 2 months(talking about roxies at $1mg) are fair. And for the most part people are happy.<br /><br />These post come up about every 4 days....along with the &quot;I need BULK ROXIES...SOMEONE PLEASE HELP&quot; post. Then 2 days later the &quot;WHY ARE THERE NO ROXIES IN HERE&quot; then 1 day later &quot; HAS LEO GOT THE ROXIE VENDORS...I&#039;M WORRIED ...I MESSAGED MY VENDOR 2 HOURS AGO AND HE HAS NOT MESSAGED ME BACK...I THINK LEO GOT HIM...I AM IN THE PROCESS OF BURNING MY GARAGE&quot; Only to find out that the guy who made the post for bulk cheap Roxies...wants them for 20 so he can sell for $35 back home. The guy who says he can get 120 for $9 just fades away as realizes there is so much more to vending then just selling the pills for X amount..And&nbsp; if he was ever going to sell ....would sell for the market price..not the $3 he told everyone. The guy who panicked and burned his garage( I swear I read that and was like WTF..your garage???) because the vendor didn&#039;t contact him for 3 hours...well his high wore off and he realized the vendor he was trying to contact was a vendor in vacation mode.<br /><br /><br />It is very simple..the market sets the price..and when you are the lone ranger with product as VICODIN was for a while after pharmville left..he could charge whatever he wanted because there are enough people here with money to spend. And there are others like yourself that choose not to. Maybe money was the factor maybe it wasn&#039;t. Maybe you found better value in something else. I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />What I do know is you were here when I started. And when I did..I promised to offer lower priced pain pills and USA made Xanax bars. When I got here Bars were $12 each. Roxie were $48 Norco 10/325 were $15.Opana 40mg were $75<br /><br />&nbsp;Now I am talking USA made and USA shipping. I said I would change that. I also said I would not raise my prices. I would not cheat people. I would ship the fastest.&nbsp; I would charge the actual shipping cost. And I would not let an order sit there for a day. If you ordered before 10pm EST. Your order went out! And if you ordered before 7pm EST you got it the next day.<br /><br />Well Vicodin kept his business and his prices. I learned that people will pay as long as they get treated right, you ship fast as fuck...did I mention ship fast as fuck? and you answered messages. <br /><br />I have done all that. My feedback proves I am a man of my word. There are now about 10 solid Rx USA vendors. All of them cool as shit. All of them great in the categories that matter. And I think if you are a USA customer looking for USA Opiads then you have 10 guys that who ever is in stock..you are going to get your meds. And that is pretty fucking cool.<br /><br />I have talked to all of them. And everyone is here to make money yet they all are not here to charge the max. They actually care about what they ship. They all want 5/5. and they all do everything to earn it. When shit hits the fan in here...It is never about a USA Rx vendor. And in truth the one complaint was VICODINS prices...but he had a product no one else did. HE took the risk. And he told you &quot;I don&#039;t care if you don&#039;t like my prices...go to someone else&quot; And those that did use him..AND A LOT DID!! Got there product fast as fuck. Perfect every time. And had no complaints. SO much so that when a new vendor came along and offered his exact pill at $5 cheaper...they stayed with him!! Like I said ....for a lot of the actual buyers..it is not always about the price. And the beauty of this place is that you have a choice. And if you have a favorite vendor then stick with them! But in our game..when one of us is out...another one will step right in. That being said...I know there are a lot of great vendors in the weed,H,coke and x game too. I just can&#039;t speak for them..because I don&#039;t vend that.<br /><br />Those are the actual facts. SR is fucking awesome if you actually take the time to learn how to use it.<br /><br />And another thing..there are a lot of people that I am sure don&#039;t like me and vice versa...but as a whole..you will be hard pressed to find a group that knows more shit then us. There are guys I fucking hate their threads...yet I would go to them in a heartbeat for an answer because they know their shit. And there are vendors that will bend over backwards for you if you really need it and you are not a dick. Pretty fucking cool. Especially for a bunch of drug dealers and addicts.<br /><br /><br />Happy Halloween<br />

				he way saying he could get dillys for 3 each and then with markup would charge 15 on here. somewhat self&#039;d himself, answered his own question. OP also said he could get oxy for .10/1mg. i mean, everyone hears talk like that all the time, IRL and on here, especially about opiates. i&#039;m not holding my breath anyways, i&#039;m no dope fiend, seen too many friends go down that road<br /><br />i&#039;m not saying there&#039;s anything wrong with following the market prices, ra ra free markets and all that, but when you consider how addiction to and demand for Rx opiates, specifically oxycodone and hydrocodone, have crazily inflated the price for those drugs in America, the least Rx vendors could do is admit that they do indeed make a hefty profit because of a very specific addiction. i mean christ think about how much a heavy daily roxi 30 habit can run a month. who can afford that?<br /><br />college kids, middle aged rich housewives, fraternity members, teenagers with wealthy/upper class parents, the sort of people who would thumb their nose in disgust at heroin and needles (generalizations yes, but not by a lot), are fueling the Rx dope craze here in the states like nowhere else on earth. and eventually a lot of those same people can&#039;t afford it anymore, should use the money for things like bills and rent and their children, burned all their bridges, but still put getting those little blue pills first. and the dealers, both here and IRL, like to act as if they are best buds with their customers, because they &quot;help them out&quot;, and desperate buyers are are all too happy to eat up the bullshit and most even do think they are being &quot;helped out&quot;, because (to dopesick pillheads who don&#039;t know better) supply can seem so strained and limited; when in fact they, the customers, are the ones forking over thousands of dollars to their dealers who get mad profits- and believe me, i&#039;ve seen that game, i know the profit margins, i knew people going to fla clinics a decade ago, when .5/1mg on oxy was considered steep, and they made bank then, just like these days. while some things have changed but that fact sure hasn&#039;t<br /><br />that&#039;s why a lot of newbies come on here, and make threads about opiate prices. they love the idea of SR for the same reasons we all do, they are tired of messing with dodgy dealers, getting ripped off, bad product, etc... they have high hopes for the SR in the opiate department, they see great deals for semi-bulk in lots of other categories, and are soon bummed to realize it hasn&#039;t changed all that much from the way it was IRL. i think if people want good deals on opes, they have to look around, for instance the powder fentanyl guy. or some of the deals on hydromorphone. really popular opiates like hydros and oxies are gonna stay pricey for the above reasons...<br /><br />i&#039;m being a little unfair, i know, i&#039;ve got some bitterness, but i think there&#039;s some truth up there.. and lol modziw... i &lt;3 blade runner<br /><br />

				Wow...well said. I liked the way you wrote it. I can tell you didn&#039;t even try and you wrote it fast but really well. And I read it fast. Good read! I agree with everything you said. And I would have quoted it but it was long and I figure if you are going to write something that dead on and ...well that good that the least I could do is answer the 1 question you asked. Even though you didn&#039;t specifically ask me, you asked all Rx dealers.....here it is for those that don&#039;t know what I am talking about-----<br /><br />the least Rx vendors could do is admit that they do indeed make a hefty profit because of a very specific addiction <br /><br /><br />I didn&#039;t know Rx vendors had a rep for not admitting that...nor did I know that people thought any different. I am also not sure if you want me to admit I make a hefty profit(I do) or if you want me to admit I make one because of an addiction? Meaning that somehow I would not admit that...I guess the answer is of course I do. But I must tell you I never think in those terms. When I got about 3/4 a way through your post..I was bummed.. Just kind of a downer when you look at it that way you wrote that. Don&#039;t get me wrong...I believe everything you said is 100% true ....though I am sure someone on here would disagree. I just never think of those things. I actually am an optimist and always think of the good. And I mean always.. I am a very positive thinker. The good being how great you feel when you are on pain meds and your not fucked up on them. How great I feel when I sell out. How happy people are when they get the package and they message me. I like the money I make selling them. I actually like the feedback when people are happy getting what they ordered.<br /><br />But I will share this. Last week I messaged a customer who also happens to be a vendor on here. I told him that my Roxie are back in. I would like to share the message he responded back to me------- First I am going to give you my message to him. A little back ground..I have been selling to him every week sometimes twice a week ...either Roxie or Opana. He would order 20 of either one. At first it was only Roxie...He is actually the person who made the write up for the dremel technique for the Opana 40. He always left the best feedback...and he always sent me great long messages on just random things. And never came across anything other then a good guy to me. Someone I liked and would chat with from time to time. So here is my message to him------<br /><br />Just wanted to let you know I have Roxie back in...<br /><br />Hope your doing good :)<br /><br />RxKing<br /><br /><br />This was his message to me 1 hour later--------<br /><br />Yeah man, Im done with opiates...I had a near death experience; ended up on narcan thanks to a friend who found me passed out and purple....from there to detox...and now in a sober house with 30 days (off opiates) still on addies and benzoes but those I need :)<br />I did find that package by the way, and its been a pleasure doing buisness with you, it was a fun run homes. stay safe and keep doin your thang.<br /><br />Much Respect,<br />C<br /><br /><br />And after I got that...I just sat back and kind of starred into my screen and thought about what would happen if someone I sold pills to actually died. And as I was just starring at the computer and thinking about this guy...my &quot;friend/customer&quot; in here and where he was at that moment...I was refreshing the inbox and every time or about every other time a new message was coming in and all I can see is the from who and the title and most just said &quot;subject&quot; but there were a few that read &quot;Love you king! Roxies are back!&quot; things like that..all I remember is me sitting there for about 45 min just thinking about what if &quot;my friend&quot; had died.<br /><br />Again realize I had messaged with him for 5 months..and he sent me sometimes 5 page long messages of the funniest, crazy stories. I mean the guy was a vendor and a buyer and gave me his address. I say he trusted me.. And he ALWAYS made me laugh..and if you read my feedback and you laugh....it was from him.. Anyways he lives back east and when I first heard of the storm I actually thought about him...I have no family back there but I do have IRL friends and I wondered about him..Was weird actually.<br /><br />But what I thought was the most amazing thing about him..... was&nbsp; his response to me. When I first read it..I was just in shock that happened to him. Then it hit me that this kind of shit happens and I was the one who gave it to him. Then I thought about all the others I have sold to and what has happened to them. And now all I think about is how great a guy he is to write me that message with no hate directed at me . You guys have read it... I just can&#039;t get over that. And I wondered if I was in his shoes... if I could write that.<br /><br />&nbsp;He said many times. I was HIS #1 guy. Yes there were others...but I was his go to vendor. I would actually send him 2 orders and he would &quot;buy&quot; the other order when he got the BTC the&nbsp; next week and i just would not send it. Not that it was much money ...but he sure thought it was...and said many a time after 3 or 4 months of maybe doing it 5 times how generous it was of me and how much he liked that I trusted him. Because he said IRL no one trusted him. <br /><br />I did. And he never once didn&#039;t do what he said he would. He really was my &quot;best&quot; customer. And after what he told me... it really made me think of what I really do.<br /><br />I know I vend to people that have no control and are in serious trouble. I also vend to others that have their life in control and just like to take meds(smallest group) I also vend to others that resell. And I vend to those that have not yet had a problem that will 100% for sure have one based on what I give them. And it makes me think how many people fucking hate me. Mothers, wife&#039;s, sisters,brothers,perky, And when I think like that it makes me want to quit.<br /><br />Yes I also vend to some that have cancer or some other health problem that give me long messages on how much they thank me and how I &quot;save&quot; their life&#039;s. I am not dumb. I realize that those people do exist but more then likely it is a &quot;sick&quot; person that is just addicted to pain killers. Even Perky told me he wont fuck with pain killers as they fucked him up before.<br /><br />A vendor on here recently told me they are stopping. And the first reason they said is they used to be addicted to pain meds and are not now..But they are sick of being the person that supplies that person that was them. It really made me think.<br /><br />It has been 2 weeks since my friend sent me that message. And I sent him back a long message thanking him for not blaming me. And I ended it with &quot;I hope you never read this&quot;&nbsp; meaning I hope he does not log onto SR.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t like to think about that truth. I know it exist. I am not stupid. But I also believe that there is another side that is not such a downer. And that is the side I think about. I don&#039;t just do it with SR. I do it in every aspect of my life. I always find the good in something. Other then animal abusers and child molesters. I think BOTH should be killed.&nbsp; <br /><br />So you ask me if I will admit I make a huge profit selling something that is highly addict-able. YES. And yes I think about all the bad it causes. Just like I think about the bad Mc Donald&#039;s causes or alcohol sales cause. So in truth if all I did was think about the bad. I would quit. And one day I will. But for now I sell Rx to anyone that has the BTC for it. And I don&#039;t think about how or where they got it. I don&#039;t think about how they are going to use it. I just do not think like that. But just being honest....in all aspects of my life I don&#039;t think about the negative. But when my friend sent me that message..... All I thought about is how he is ok. And how he didn&#039;t blame me. How if I didn&#039;t vend to him...someone else would have.<br /><br /><br />And I am just happy he didn&#039;t die.<br /><br /><br /><br />

That being said I think the buyers should use discretion when dealing with customers who are clearly irresponsible, young or immature. But that goes with every other vendor too, wHEN SoME1 talks LIke tihs,,,, then don&#039;t sell to them. In my opinion anyways.

				RxKing, first congrats on recently being made a mod - if you have any questions let me know and i will try to help you. hope you can help remove the spam and keep things running smoothly. i love the community because of how so many different individuals come together with similar interests and it can be an amazing opportunity to share and learn as well <br /><br />i too get very tried of all these posts about the prices, like i said i think given the service people are receiving its is very reasonable so they should just be grateful or shut up and dont buy them <br /><br />thanks for not quoting the long posts as you mentioned too :) that just annoys me, especially people quoting huge amounts of text then leaving a couple word response lol<br /><br />i also think it is interesting to see the market forces at work here, especially as member numbers have increased so does the demand. even though the number of vendors, and thus supply, has increased the prices continued to go up from where they were when i initially began traveling down the Road. i used to be able to get roxy on SR from GF for about 22 dollars. then slowly the prices increased more with each order and now its around or over 30 a piece. i actually use opiates for a GI medical condition, which opiates work amazingly well for but doctors are unwilling to prescribe (i will admit i am also psychologically addicted too though because i used them for my depression and anxiety as well and now im fucked). it eventually got to where i could no longer get the same amount that i was used to because of the increased price unfortunately. therefore i switched to H which provided an increased relief to cost ratio for the funds i have available each month

				If you read the UNODC report 2012 it highlights &#039; <br /><br />Afghanistan and Myanmar where, despite&nbsp; an increase in opium production, farm-gate prices continued to rise in 2010 and 2011. The latter may imply that illicit demand for opium and&nbsp; its derivatives is continuing to increase in spite of the recent&nbsp; recovery of opium production. While it is difficult to identify one specific reason for this, it could be an underestimation of global heroin consumption, especially in countries in Asia that are major markets and countries in&nbsp; Africa that are possible emerging markets, or to an expansion in the market for raw opium (not processed into heroin), which could feed increased opium consumption and, perhaps, a parallel illicit market for opiates such as morphine. High prices at source could also be explained&nbsp; by speculation in the local market<br /><br />The price of H has increased and there is also a greater world demand for it , interestingly I am doing some research among SR buyers at the moment and none of them have been Oxy or H buyers , if you want to know more about the research DM me

				The whining about prices kind of blows my mind. If you can sell for cheaper, do it. If you can get your shit locally for cheaper, do it. The prices are the way they are for a reason.<br /><br />Whoever said that people like me (buyers who happily pay the current opiate prices) are &quot;hurting the experience&quot; or whatever for the normal SR user.... The &quot;normal SR users&quot; are the people paying these prices. They&#039;re the majority. I&#039;m not going to boycott marked up drugs on principle just because my poorer brethren can&#039;t afford them. These prices are more than fair in my eyes.

				Yeah, that prices for opiates are ridiculous anymore. I thought they were starting to get high on the streets and I come to SR hoping for lower prices and I get the opposite.<br /><br />Basically, unless you have a VERY LOW TOLERANCE or are injecting, buying your opiates from SR isn&#039;t a good idea.<br /><br />And RxKing, I don&#039;t know about your prices on vicodin, but anything over $5 for 10mg of hydrocodone is just flat out money grubbing. Honestly, I quit buying them on the street once they hit $3 in my area. It takes me AT LEAST 80mg of hydrocodone to even begin to feel anything. With the avg price of a 10 on SR being $7-$8, that&#039;s $56-$64 for a buzz that will only last me about 2 hrs. Far from worth it.<br /><br />As for the other, stronger opiates, it&#039;s not even economical to SNORT them at these prices! These people aren&#039;t outright telling you to start using a needle, but the implication is staring dead at you.<br /><br />But, the bottom line is THEY CAN charge these prices so THEY ARE. I don&#039;t necessarily like it, but then again I refuse to pay these greedy bastards what they are asking for such small amounts of opiates, so it&#039;s not my problem. <br /><br />Would I like to buy some opiates off SR? No doubt, but I simply will not unless I stumble across something lower than street prices because I have to pay commission fees to get my money onto SR before even spending any real money.<br /><br />But, there are obviously idiots out there paying their prices, so they don&#039;t need to lower their prices to accommodate for people who are smart with their money. Unfortunately, though, the people paying these prices probably NEED the stuff, and are taken advantage of by these greedy vendors because they know the situation. It&#039;s pretty demented and evil, if you think about it.<br /><br />As I said, though- as long as people are paying these prices, they will not be lowered. I mean- would YOU lower your prices if you weren&#039;t having issues with sales? So, until you can find a way to get junkies to put economics before their addiction, they will continue to be preyed upon by industrious pushers.<br /><br />Give me a fuckin break- $10 for a god damned Norco 10/350? Why not just go straight for the needle? Same goes for oxycodone, people seem to think it&#039;s gold these days. Just because it has &quot;oxy&quot; in its name doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s worth double the money- it isn&#039;t that much more potent than hydrocodone... You can just inject it, and not everyone wants to go down that path.<br />

				Only read the first and current page of this thread, so pardon any redundancy in my 2 cents:<br /><br />I notice the meth market prices have dropped significantly over the past year as the number of vendors grew. Average price has dropped by nearly 50% over the 6 months as the number of vendors grew. Obviously the invisible hand at work there. It&#039;s puzzles me why the same hasn&#039;t happened with opiates, which collectively seem far more abundant both globally and internationally, not to mention a demand equal to or (far) greater. Maybe the later is precisely the reason. <br /><br />I&#039;m no economist, or expert on global drug markets, nor do I regularly peruse the opiate listings (because of the outrageous prices)...but I fail to see how the &quot;hard work, effort, and risk&quot; card to justify prices holds up compared to the above example. <br /><br />I&#039;d love to grab the occasional OC for myself and constantly get inquiries on norco, percs, and vics, but their reaction and mine is always the same- &quot;Seriously? Fuck that! I&#039;d never pay that much!&quot;. So it&#039;s never happened, never will... maybe one day when that aforementioned kingpen(s) enters the scene...or more likely, terminal saturation of of &quot;minipens&quot;.<br /><br />I know for certain that unconnected nobodies IRL (in terms of drugs/Rx) are 100% capable of vending Rx at 1/2 the average price (or less) and making a worthy profit. And even more certain of well connected individuals doing the same. Where are they then? Trickling slowly but surely, as they have in other areas of the market.&nbsp; I believe many of them are either unaware of digital marketplaces or lack the proficiency required to access and successfully operate on them. There is a sharp generational gap in computer literacy across the globe coupled to ever growing incentives (ie- poverty, unemployment, and limited opportunity). <br /><br />I hope those vendors enjoying the current complimentary tug job from the free market enjoy it while it lasts. She&#039;ll soon be busy with a generation of computer literate would-be corner boys, and countless Asians.<br /><br />

I will try one last tine.<br /><br />The prices for anything on SR could be complained about. I understand that. But I think what you point out and what drugfather has said that us vendors are greedy is simply not true. Again you can have your opinion and you have stated it. But I don&#039;t think you know all the FACTS. I will try and give them to you and drugfather.<br /><br />I have sold n her for 7 months. And in that time I have sold the 30mg at$19 each $22 and now for the last 5 months $29.88. Lets say I sell 1k Roxicodone 30mg a month. If I were to raise my prices by $5 a pill you are talking about me grossing 5 thousand dollars more a month. $5000.00 more a month. I would say that is more money then a&nbsp; lot of people make&nbsp; a month IRL. Now lets take the average order of 20 pills. And lets say I just went&nbsp; $2 bucks more a pill. That would raise the average order just $40 bucks. They would not care. Trust me they would still order 20 pills and I would still sell out. And that would make me two thousand more dollars!! The $5 bucks they would notice...but the 2 bucks they would not and on that 1 pill alone I would make $2,000.00 more!!! <br /><br />Why should I not do it?????? <br /><br />In fact in writing this ...it&nbsp; makes me think how I should do it. My customers would still by them. I would still sell out. I am not being greedy as I could go for $5 bucks and I am only doing 2. I still would not be the highest price per pill. So there is absolutely no down side at all! Just more money for me!!!!! Would take me less then 30 seconds. That is it. I am 30 seconds away from making TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS every 4 weeks!!! Don&#039;t read further. Put yourself in my shoes and ask your self what you would do. Think about your life right now. And think that if you just spent 30 seconds that you could then make $500 more per week. You don&#039;t have to do anything else.<br /><br />Well YOU tell me you wouldn&#039;t want an extra 2 thousand dollars every month?? You tell me if your boss came to you and offered you 2 thousand dollars and you don&#039;t have to do anything you are not already doing you would say no. If you did would you be greedy?<br /><br />Well the reason I have not is .....I said I wouldn&#039;t 5 months ago. That&#039;s it! Pretty stupid huh? I didn&#039;t sign anything, if I did no one would get mad really and if they did it would not affect me at all IRL. By doing so would not cost me anything at all. It would just take 30 seconds to change the price. Again the more and more I type it makes me think how I should do it. I could use the extra two thousand dollars every 4 weeks ;)<br /><br />But I won&#039;t. And I can tell you that not only me but the vendors Peels4u,Costco,OxyFlight,Hatter26, Modziw,freetodecide and Dannybrown all are in the EXACT same position as me and as they too could have higher prices and are not just trying to get the highest price they can. Again we are all here to make money. PERIOD. We risk a lot. But to say that we are greedy is flat out wrong. Not only that ...but I and those other vendors actually go out of our way to help the customers we have. And I would say that the customers we deal with don&#039;t think of price as the #1 reason to buy our pills&nbsp; from us. <br /><br />All of us have different prices but not by much at all. And&nbsp; all of us get are pills different ways and have different cost in doing so.&nbsp; But unlike other drugs sold on here ...we actually all vend the EXACT same pill. And all of us have great feedback and if you got all of us to respond in here they would tell you that the prices we charge are not the highest we cold. That OUR customers are happy about the prices we all have. And that we all sell out every month and we still would if we raised are per pill price by 2 bucks each. Even 5 bucks each. So the one thing we are not is greedy.<br /><br />No matter the price...people are going to want lower. And as you have proved...you can&#039;t make everyone happy and some are flat out angry. I am sorry for that. I understand that for you ...the pills are to expensive. And in fact drugfather has said he cant afford the prices.&nbsp; And I think that is the biggest reason he is complaining IMO. BMW&#039;s, bottle service at clubs, $2500 blow jobs from playmates are examples of things IRL that you could have wrote this post about. And truth is... for you... you would be telling your truth. <br /><br />I took the time to respond to you in this post so you would understand this side of it. If you read your own post you actually say that you too would sell pills for the most you can and that you understand. Well I have pointed out that we don&#039;t sell for the most we can. That I sell out every month and so do the other vendors. <br /><br />The price of the pills is made by YOU the buyer. The market is what makes the price. PERIOD. And the market for us made Rx is a great one. We sell something that is very hard to get. You can&#039;t go to Mexico or any other country and buy them. And getting a hold of more then a personal size script is almost impossible ;) for most people. You can&#039;t grow it. Nothing. And there is not another place to go online and buy Roxicodone. And yes I know that you can bring up some other place..I realize SR is not the only place but it is the only one that matters. The place you can go and for sure 100% get what you ordered and not get ripped off. <br /><br />There is a lot that go&#039;s into being a vendor. I won&#039;t go into it as you can find that info in other threads. But I will address another thing you bring up. The cost it is for YOU to get the btc. Well there is a cost for us too ... to get cash from the btc you give us. So lets just call that a wash. <br /><br />I read your post and I can tell that you are mad/frustrated with the prices for everything on here(especially pain meds) And I understand. Well SR is not for everyone. Just like BMW&#039;s and bottle service are not either. If you were to go to every USA Rx vendors and read are feedback you would see that our customers are very happy and your view along with the OP&#039;s (drugfather) is in the minority. And I think that it is coming from your frustration that you can&#039;t afford what you want and not so much based on the facts. I am sorry for that. But I wrote this response to give you some of the facts. And to let you know that us Rx vendors are in no way charging the most money we can. But realize this is a market place and we are only here at the end of the day to make money. And after writing this I realize that we should actually raise are prices. But I know we won&#039;t. Because we aren&#039;t that greedy I guess :)<br /><br />

				I have to agree with RxKing^.&nbsp; SR is a marketplace.&nbsp; With the exception of some psychedelic vendors who seem to have unlimited supply and sell for outragously higher prices than other vendors with comparable products, most vendors set their prices at a.) what makes them a profit, and b.) what their customers willingly pay.&nbsp; If you think they are higher than your local prices, get them locally.&nbsp; If you think they are higher than they should be, start vending and undercutting the other vendors.&nbsp; Otherwise, you think they are higher than you&#039;d like, which means nothing here.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t know about most buyers of opiates here, but personally, I only buy opiates on SR like 2 or 3 times a year, and usually a small supply for 2 or 3 highs between me and some friends.&nbsp; Since I&#039;m not constantly supporting a habit, paying the SR premium (including commissions, shipping, security in addition to profit for vendors) isn&#039;t a big deal for me.&nbsp; Hell, it might even be that since I don&#039;t have a habit, I do have the money for that premium so it&#039;s not a big deal.&nbsp; Yet another thing is I move around a lot for my job, so it&#039;s rarely convienient for me to make my way back to the one place in the world where I know I can score locally, just so I can score.&nbsp; To do so would cost me round trip plane tickets, place to stay, meals not paid for by work...etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s SO MUCH EASIER to log on, pay a little extra, and have it delivered to me anywhere I am.&nbsp; But like I said, my days of wanting it all the time are many years in the past.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe that everyone who buys opiates on SR is supporting a habit.&nbsp; Can any vendors shed some light on what they perceive their customers habits to be, based on quantity/frequency of orders among their customers?&nbsp; I&#039;d be interested to know the breakdown...

				10 cents/mg, fuck dude you live in mother fucking ultra wonder/candy land, I hate you :P<br /><br />I guess that&#039;s what privatized health care leads to.&nbsp; Street prices of Rx opiates around here are about the same as they are on SR. <br /><br />Guess what i&#039;m saying is not all countries&#039; blackmarket&#039;s can operate so cheaply.&nbsp; No such thing as doctor shopping in many countries :(<br /><br />It&#039;s a free market anyways, you don&#039;t like the price here then don&#039;t come here, seems pretty simple to me.

				RxKing, I totally understand where you&#039;re coming from, don&#039;t get me wrong. I definitely acknowledge the fact that you could raise the prices to whatever the hell you want to and desperate junkies would still buy them.<br /><br />But, put yourself in my shoes. I can understand the higher prices on roxies a LITTLE BIT MORE than those of hydrocodone, so let&#039;s consider roxies for the sake of argument. Being that I swore off of the needle a couple years ago, I would likely snort them. I would need to snort 60mg of roxy to even begin to feel a buzz. At you&#039;re prices combined with the BTC- I&#039;m not calling that a wash because it isn&#039;t, but I will leave shipping out of the equation. Even without considering shipping, I&#039;m looking at over $60 for a 4 hour buzz.<br /><br />It may be worth it to some people, but it&#039;s not worth it to me. I refuse to pay $60 for a 4 hour buzz. Now, I may bitch about it on the forums, but I will never PM you such complaints because I do understand the situation and I do respect what you&#039;re doing to a certain degree. I believe sending you a PM saying such things would be flat out disrespectful, counter-productive, and a waste of time.<br /><br />Honestly, oxycodone is barely worth $.50/mg to me, so I will not pay more than that.<br /><br />However, although I do understand you&#039;re position: that &quot;you COULD charge more&quot;... That argument goes both ways: you COULD charge less. But, you because you know you do not need to because you are enjoying enough sales at current prices. This is where motive comes into play, you ARE here to make money, and I don&#039;t blame you, I wouldn&#039;t do it for free either. And you proved my point in your last post, in my opinion- that you ARE falling victim to greed:<br /><br />&quot;I have sold n her for 7 months. And in that time I have sold the 30mg at$19 each $22 and now for the last 5 months $29.88. Lets say I sell 1k Roxicodone 30mg a month. If I were to raise my prices by $5 a pill you are talking about me grossing 5 thousand dollars more a month. $5000.00 more a month. I would say that is more money then a&nbsp; lot of people make&nbsp; a month IRL. Now lets take the average order of 20 pills. And lets say I just went&nbsp; $2 bucks more a pill. That would raise the average order just $40 bucks. They would not care. Trust me they would still order 20 pills and I would still sell out. And that would make me two thousand more dollars!! The $5 bucks they would notice...but the 2 bucks they would not and on that 1 pill alone I would make $2,000.00 more!!! <br /><br />Why should I not do it??&quot;<br /><br />There is no reason you should not do it, if you want to be greedy, and the fact that you have already raised them from $19 to $30 is an obvious manifestation of greed.<br /><br />Now, all these vendors on here justify their high prices with the same old argument &quot;You do not understand everything we do... There is a lot of cost... There is a lot of risk...&quot; This argument falls short in my opinion.<br /><br />I understand&nbsp; that you must sit behind the computer to process orders. I understand you must assume risk via shipping drugs through the mail. <br /><br />But, in most cases, the consumer eats the extra costs incurred by shipping. And, in most cases, vendors will be paying bills for internet service and will have already had bought a computer anyways. So, if you don&#039;t mind explaining where all these extra costs are coming from- now&#039;s your chance. I assure you that I will not reject your arguments before even typing them, I will actually consider them.<br /><br />Now onto time processing orders. How are you spending any more time slanging pills than street dealers? Hell, if you&#039;re doing things right (and I bet you are), you should be filling MORE orders in a SHORTER amount of time than if you were slanging on the street. Seriously, you&#039;re only wasting gas money driving to the post office, and you&#039;re likely making multiple drops in one trip. So, you should HAVE less costs and LESS time spent making runs by selling on SR, not more- unless you have no clue how to plan trips and make the most of your time. And, I highly doubt that you&#039;re too stupid to be able to perform competently =).<br /><br />How about risk? Sure, there is the element of shipping through the mail. That would for sure be a huge charge if you ever got caught. But, how is it any more risk than making multiple runs in a day as a street dealer? You&#039;re not driving back and forth to pick up and drop off. In fact, you SHOULD be spending less time riding dirty than if you were a street dealer. So, as long as you&#039;re smart- using PGP, not shipping from the same post office/area every time, and not ordering drugs from your vendor account... THe risk should be LESS than that of a street dealer.<br />With that said, as you said- you COULD charge more. And, I CAN refuse to buy from you until you lower prices to something I see economically wise. Realistically, though, you do not need to accommodate to people like me, and I understand that =). Do your thing, bro!<br />However, don&#039;t lie to yourself and tell yourself that you&#039;re not being greedy. We&#039;re all anarcho-capitalists here, driven by profits or pleasure! We should all embrace what we are! Just don&#039;t kid yourself as to what your motives are.<br />And, the prices that most vendors offer opiates for on SR are a clear manifestation of that desire for profit. Sure, you COULD raise tour prices, but you COULD lower them just the same ;).<br /><br />As for reasons why? <br />Why should you raise prices? Obviously, to get more money. More money is always nice. And, as you said, you most likely would not have a problem with sales.<br />Why should you lower prices? It all comes down to your morals and motives. If you care about being a decent person and hooking people up- lower your prices. You will lose profits that you have already demonstrated you&#039;re capable of earning, but you will make a lot more people satisfied with the prices they&#039;re getting. And, people like me will actually considering buying off of SR. I also like to believe that karma will pay you back in the long run.<br /><br />Maybe you don&#039;t believe in karma. Maybe you are just in it for the money. Fine. But I do know that a lot more people would buy off of you if you did lower prices, yes- I realize customer base is not an issue, but it just comes down to if you want to be a good dude or not and give people (at least) SOMEWHAT fair prices on their opiates. <br /><br />But, if you do not want to give people fair prices, fine. But... Please don&#039;t lie to yourself and tell yourself you aren&#039;t being greedy! And please don&#039;t hold a grandiose self-image and assume you&#039;re risking more and incurring more costs than a street dealer. Yes, there are differences than selling on the street, but in my opinion the differences cancel out into a wash... &quot;Tit 4 Tat.&quot; And they surely don&#039;t justify the inflated prices seen on SR, IMO, either.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong- I may be willing to pay a premium for the convenience of having it shipped to my door. But, $1+/mg oxycodone, and ESPECIALLY $1+/mg hydrocodone is FAR MORE than a premium to me. It&#039;s price-gouging, no way around it. <br /><br />But again, it&#039;s your business so do what you want, and I will do the same by not buying opiates of SR until they are what I see as reasonable. Will they ever get there? Who knows... But I do realize you don&#039;t need my business, and I&#039;m fine with that. Because, luckily, I have treated people right in my past, so I have a pretty large network of people that give me fair prices in return so I don&#039;t need your business, either. However, I must admit, it would be Fn AWESOME if prices were closer to actual value on SR =).<br /><br />Good luck, and be safe!

				Nellion I am just responding to your post .. I did not quote it as it is to long.<br /><br />First you are coming from the spot where YOU can&#039;t afford it. I said that I understand that ....for you and others price are to high...Just like not everyone gets bottle service in a nite club. You seem to totally understand what I wrote..then you just fall off and act as if you didn&#039;t even read what I said.<br /><br />Here is one of the things you said-----<br /><br />Now, all these vendors on here justify their high prices with the same old argument &quot;You do not understand everything we do... There is a lot of cost... There is a lot of risk...&quot; This argument falls short in my opinion<br /><br />First I don&#039;t even agree with that. I do not believe the prices are to high! I know they are for YOU but they are not for most of the people. I have explained this a lot. I don&#039;t think a vendor has to ever defend their prices. They make them and you either buy them or not. And I was never doing that. I was just explaining to you my business. I thought I made that clear. This is a market place. You come in here and you buy or you don&#039;t. We as vendors list things to sell. As I have explained in great detail I sell out every single month. So price is not an issue at all. YOU simply can&#039;t afford it. That&#039;s it. I don&#039;t think you go out and pay for a first class ticket when you fly. Other do.<br /><br />Again let me make it clear that I know some people are going to always say prices are to high. What I don&#039;t understand it how anyone would say that when if they had it....they would want the highest price they could get for it. I have read where some have said &quot; making X amount is enough...vendors should not be greedy&quot;. It is always someone who does not have something and really wants it but can&#039;t afford it.Just like it is the guy with the small dick saying girls don&#039;t care about size.<br /><br />You said this----<br /><br />There is no reason you should not do it, if you want to be greedy, and the fact that you have already raised them from $19 to $30 is an obvious manifestation of greed.<br /><br />Again you are just wrong. The reason I raised it from $19 to $30 is that the first time I sold at $19 they were purchased and resold on here for $30!!!! The market say&#039;s the lowest for 30mg Roxicodone is around $25 to $34. I have 20 messages a week from other vendors wanting to buy 500 for $23 so they can then sell from $30 to$ 40 IRL. For some reason they believe that selling 400 at once would be a good thing for me. You use the word greed. LOL that word never even enters my head. Though making money does. I sell my pills to make money. Not to help others. This is a business about profit. You should understand that. And you should realize if you could afford it you would not have the co0mplaints you do. Though people that can afford something still complain. People are always going to complain. I don&#039;t think you are. But I think you need to recognize that you are in the minority.<br /><br />You said this----<br /><br />But, in most cases, the consumer eats the extra costs incurred by shipping. And, in most cases, vendors will be paying bills for internet service and will have already had bought a computer anyways. So, if you don&#039;t mind explaining where all these extra costs are coming from- now&#039;s your chance. I assure you that I will not reject your arguments before even typing them, I will actually consider them.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t even consider those things like internet or shipping as an extra cost. I was just saying in my post that I was not going to break down every little thing. I was just trying to say that we have cost and if you search the forums you can find out all those. But the number one thing is I am selling drugs and no matter how much money I make it is not worth my freedom. And I know you may think you have the same risk buying them...it is not even close. So if I am going to do this then I am going to make it worth my time. It really is that simple..it is not like I factor in every little thing. I don&#039;t.<br /><br />You said this---<br /><br />Now onto time processing orders. How are you spending any more time slanging pills than street dealers? Hell, if you&#039;re doing things right (and I bet you are), you should be filling MORE orders in a SHORTER amount of time than if you were slanging on the street. Seriously, you&#039;re only wasting gas money driving to the post office, and you&#039;re likely making multiple drops in one trip. So, you should HAVE less costs and LESS time spent making runs by selling on SR, not more- unless you have no clue how to plan trips and make the most of your time. And, I highly doubt that you&#039;re too stupid to be able to perform competently =).<br /><br />Why in the world do you even compare this to what IRL drug dealers do? There is very little comparison. I know I have never made one. I don&#039;t even consider us close to the same thing. I have never done what you say..I know other vendors have...I have not. And so I don&#039;t have anything to say about this other then it does not apply to anything I have said.<br /><br />You say this-------------------<br /><br /><br />It may be worth it to some people, but it&#039;s not worth it to me. I refuse to pay $60 for a 4 hour buzz. Now, I may bitch about it on the forums, but I will never PM you such complaints because I do understand the situation and I do respect what you&#039;re doing to a certain degree. I believe sending you a PM saying such things would be flat out disrespectful, counter-productive, and a waste of time.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is the most important thing you say. It clearly says that YOU don&#039;t think so and YOU can&#039;t afford it. Well you are in the minority of my buyers. I think you should realize that your whole post is coming from someone who cant afford the prices now. That&#039;s it. And I have said I understand your position. But I would not think it is disrespectful of you to send a message to a vendor asking for a better price. Why would it be??? Worst case is they say no :) so you have nothing to lose..<br /><br />A lot of your other points are comparing me to a street vendor. And I have already said that there is no comparison. And I have never even said there was. Yet in your message you act as if I did and I used them as reason for my prices. Did you even read my message???(lol) I clearly said I was not defending anything as I don&#039;t feel I have to. That your opinion is not the one everyone has. And that you clearly come from a point of you can&#039;t afford what you actually like and want. I even said..I am sorry for that...as you don&#039;t make enough money...but there is nothing I can do about that. I was giving you information and telling you my position. Not trying to defend it. I made it clear I sell out. I made it clear I would sell out if I raised my prices.<br /><br />You said this----<br /><br />Why should you raise prices? Obviously, to get more money. More money is always nice. And, as you said, you most likely would not have a problem with sales.<br />Why should you lower prices? It all comes down to your morals and motives. If you care about being a decent person and hooking people up- lower your prices. You will lose profits that you have already demonstrated you&#039;re capable of earning, but you will make a lot more people satisfied with the prices they&#039;re getting. And, people like me will actually considering buying off of SR. I also like to believe that karma will pay you back in the long run.<br /><br />How you even say morals and motives makes me think that you simply mistyped or you didn&#039;t read what I wrote. I said I WAS NOT GOING TO raise my prices. I told you why. BUT morals has nothing to do with it at all. Do you not understand when you are selling something you are doing it to make money? Raising my prices has nothing to do with my morals. In fact if I were to in the future to&nbsp; raise my price for the pills it would be because I wanted to make more money. Maybe it cost me more to get them..maybe I just wanted more money..either way it has nothing at all to do with my morals. The you say that if I cared about hooking people up I would lower my prices??????? WTF.. I hook people up all the time..but even those vendors that don&#039;t..do you not realize that how I feel about someone has nothing to do with my business. You do realize this is a business and I am in business to make money. I wrote a whole post how I could make more and why I don&#039;t. The more you write the more it is clear you simply can&#039;t afford what you really want. You either need to make more money or go shop somewhere else. Should BMW lower there prices so someone that makes 35k a year can buy an M5? Should Louis Vuitton lower there price?? The answer is of course not!&nbsp; Don&#039;t miss the message in my message. I was just posting to explain my situation ...to give you a behind the scenes. That&#039;s it. <br /><br />Another poster said &quot; if the prices are not too high....why are people complaining?&nbsp; That is such a stupid post. But let me again state some FACTS. Look at the bottom of the home page in the forums. The most people there ever is in here is 150. These forums in no way represent the market place! And even in here ...very very few actually complain. In fact in this thread more buyers are telling you and the others how you are in fact wrong and they are fine with the prices. Again I state that every person would want lower.....but MOST...yes MOST are just fine. Less then 5% of my buyers even come to the forums.<br /><br /><br />Also someone else posted about &quot;junkies&quot; and how they will always pay whatever. Well I will address that. First what is a junky? Yes I know..but some will say we all are. So using the word how you meant it.. I would say less then 20% of my customers fall in that category. I will also tell you that most of my customers have money. They make more then 100K a year. They can afford it. And a lot of them just like to sometimes get high. I do feel bad for those addicted and understand that sucks. But nothing I can do. I sell drugs!! I am not a hospital or a doctor or a rehab clinic. Buyers come to me. I don&#039;t go to them. And lowering my prices sure in not the answer to help them.<br /><br />So let me say this...I understand where you are coming from. I hope you can read this and understand where I am. I think you sent your message not being mean or a dick or anything like that. Just giving your opinion. I hope you see that all I am doing is responding and giving you my facts. I am in no way trying to make you feel bad or call you anything. But I think you need to realize that your position is not the same as everyone else. And I think the best analogy is IRL shopping at Wallmart vs shopping at Neiman Marcus. Not everyone can do both. And others ...that can&#039;t.... would not even if they could. I understand that. But the fact is Neiman Marcus has a market and that market is not for everyone. And they realize that. <br /><br /><br />I do too.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I like how we established during the course of the thread that the prices are indeed that high because vendors are &quot;greedy&quot; and not necessarily because the global price has gone up that much. I&#039;m alright with the market regulating the prices but it&#039;s really a moral balancing act to charge addicts these prices.<br /><br />I also posted earlier that the increased anonymity and shipping costs are no valid reason to raise the prices above street prices because the vendor also profits from the anonymity and the shipping costs are usually paid separately by the buyer.

				We didn&#039;t establish that the prices have gone up because of vendor greed. As to talking about global index...lol..that has ZERO to do with how vendors price things.<br /><br />I do not know why it is so hard for some of you to understand this. ...We set our prices based on the market for them! That is it. It has NOTHING to do with IRL prices. I believe that I get more per pill on SR then I do IRL. But there is a ton more work and a lot more overhead.<br /><br />Also something that you(plecks) and the rest of the complaining buyers in this post have failed to address and is a fact ....that is more important then everything I have said............THE PRICES FOR OPIATES HAVE GONE DOWN ON SR IN THE LAST 6 MO!!!!! There has been more suppliers. When I first started vending 7 mo ago..Roxicodone was $60 each for a 30mg.<br /><br />The market dictates the price. Period. And the market for Rx opiates is bigger then the availability. It is the hottest market on SR. I think weed is the biggest and the easiest thing to get. On here and real life. But hands down Rx opiates are the hottest item for USA buyers.There are vendors&nbsp; across the pond that don&#039;t even know what Roxicodone is.They had to be explained what they are in the vendor forum. They had no clue.It is a great thing to be vending Rx. I am very lucky to have the access I do.<br /><br />Again I understand supply and demand, it seems though no one wants to talk about that. The few people that have posted in this thread have yet to admit that in fact vendors could charge more. That the demand is that high. That they themselves can&#039;t afford a drug they desperately want. And that other can. And it is not just &quot;junky&#039;s&quot;. And even if it is just junky&#039;s...who cares..Their btc is the exact same.<br /><br />Another person posted how he is addicted and he can&#039;t stop. He has a problem. But the answer is not for us to lower prices. Again since some of you reading this have not read everything...I am in no way defending anything. I am just a vendor giving you MY reasons and telling you that I could charge more. I think that is a great thing!<br /><br />I understand these post and I have no problems telling the truth..That I make a lot of profit on these pills. If there was one drug that should be lower it is weed. It is strange to me how high prices still are. With all the legalization for medical weed. I thought prices would go down. And in here it seems quality weed is high for a 1/4. So is coke. So is heroin. And there is good reason for it. You can come in here and click a few buttons and have a stealth package arrive at your door in less then 24 hours! That is awesome!!! If you really think about it prices are really low. It should not even be compared to IRL. What I find strange also is how people bring up how cheep things are IRL. If that is the case....by them there!!! Of course I know that is not the case. And I know most people simply don&#039;t even know where to get Rx IRL. They can get weed. They can&#039;t get Rx. And if they do...it is a few pills. You can come in here and order 300 Roxicodone and have them tomorrow!!! You can&#039;t do that IRL.<br /><br />When this thread started out, I thought the OP just wanted to hear the real answer from an actual vendor. That they were not angry. That they were just frustrated they could not afford something they wanted. And they wanted to know how we got our prices. I think I have been more transparent in this then any other vendor I have seen in a thread. I make no apologies for having a hot item. And having a drug that is very hard to get.<br /><br /><br /><br />Silk Road is awesome! Bit coin is awesome. I love this place. You should too.<br />

				I said &quot;greed&quot; not greed and I&#039;m aware of the fact that prices here aren&#039;t dictated by real life value. You gave the best example yourself by saying that you charge 2 bucks more here and there not because you have to but because it&#039;ll give you a significant increase in revenue at the end of the day while still pushing all your stock.<br /><br />The fact that you are always giving such lengthy responses shows that people commenting about you guys selling to addicts and upping the prices simultaneously hits a nerve though.

				I love SR and it has provided me with opportunities to try certain substances I would either have to put myself into uncomfortable situations to procure or things I may never have access to IRL and I appreciate that....However the cost of most drugs on this site, for me personally, are too high to be worth buying them.&nbsp; I need about 60mg of oxy to get high but I usually like to snort somewhere in the 90-120mg range and it isn&#039;t worth it for me to pay over 100 dollars to be high for a few hours. I luckily get the 30&#039;s IRL for 10 a piece but there is a limit on how many I can get so, I will admit I have bought opiates on SR twice in my 9 months here because I couldn&#039;t find any IRL and felt like getting under that big fuzzy blanket for a few hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sure the prices could be lower but as along as the demand is there the prices will stay about the same..The vendors are risking their freedom and people will pay the prices so I don&#039;t see why they would lower the price if they already get as much business as they can handle and have supply for at over a dollar a mg..Honestly the people who buy the opiates on here must either; make a lot of money, be on the verge of going through withdraws and can&#039;t find anything IRL, or have very low tolerances.&nbsp; I don&#039;t consider myself to have a high tolerance but I am certainly no longer opiate naive.&nbsp; Shit, maybe I&#039;m lucky, the street price for oxy around me has never been close to 1.00/mg.. The only drugs on here that are cheaper than IRL for me are the various mdma products from europe and the different benzo powders...so that&#039;s all I buy unless I have some extra money and want to try something new.

				I find it hard to complain about prices on the silk road. Certainly some things are a lot cheaper in the real world, however in many categories I see a medium price range considerably lower than the prices I was raised on. All of this is absolutely beside the point though, as the silk road is more than just a dealer, but a delivery service. I expect to pay more for someone to procure/ clandestinely manufacture drugs and deliver them to my doorstep, sparing the buyer all the bullshit, deception, and obvious drawbacks of having a dealer in the real world; not to mention finding one that have what you want. Sure you can find the bread and butter of the &quot;free world&quot; in the majority of places if you know the right people, but the silk road not only gives you the staples and the otherwise inaccessible drugs. It also gives you a wide range of products and prices. Rather than having three numbers for cocaine connections in your city where one is decent, but never answers his phone, and the other two have the same source, you have lists of sellers from around the world

I wish that the vendors would stop charging $15.00 for priority shipping using very minimal techniques.&nbsp; If they want to be paid more for the time they put into their work they should put that in the product pricing.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; I think it is fair to hope that increased supply can drive the market down to a slightly more reasonable rate, but not so low that it drives the reliable and reputable vendors away.&nbsp; I am definitely happy to pay extra for the security and anonymity that SR provides.&nbsp;

				Just plain old supply and demand at it&#039;s purest.&nbsp; &nbsp;Works for me...&nbsp; Any vendor with good product can sell for whatever suits them, and I&#039;m free to buy...or not, as it suits me.&nbsp; We&#039;ve all seen how good &#039;controlling the markets&#039; works at a country-wide level...lets not fuck it up on here....<br /><br />I&#039;m a buyer, not a vendor, but I&#039;ve been on here long enough to know the headaches the vendors go through dealing with us, and they up prices or leave, as they get sick of the bullshit....so I&#039;m just glad a few of them stick around and provide me what I need..cuz otherwise it&#039;s the streets, dude, and I&#039;m sick of them, and the consequences of playing on them....

Since we pay that separately and up to 10 bucks for a vacuum sealed bubble envelop I don&#039;t think this argument can hold any kind of ground. The increased &quot;coordination&quot; is also bs because street vendors have to be just as careful with prepaid phones and stuff if they&#039;re trying to push these kinds of volumes and they run a way higher risk of getting their asses busted. <br /><br />Being a vendor here is way more convenient than selling on the street and I just disagree with the sentiment of vendors being some kind of good guys that fight for the man. I don&#039;t even buy any kind of opiates but I just wanted to point out that some of the arguments made in this thread are just not true. The price might be alright but coordination and shipping are shitty arguments and it&#039;s obvious that the decks are stacked against the consumers on SR because of the overlapping interests of SR and vendors. This is also the reason why people are still allowed to ask for FE in the way it&#039;s still done.<br /><br />Everyone who is a buyer should be a bit more responsible and not bow down to your vendor overlords just because they act like the saviours they simply aren&#039;t.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been reading this post since it started since I happen to be a customer of both RxKing and OxyFlight. <br /><br />The OP sentiment pretty much embodies what is going wrong in America right now. I live here, so I know. I have one question:<br /><br />Since when the FUCK did making a profit on your business make you a greedy, disgusting, horrible, dishonest person?? <br /><br />I don&#039;t see you up in arms over LeBron James and Nike&#039;s new shoes. So it&#039;s okay to pay $200 - $300 for a fucking pair of sneakers that cost $3 to make....but it&#039;s not okay to pay a premium for illegal drugs??? <br /><br />Capitalism is being beat to death....<br /><br />
