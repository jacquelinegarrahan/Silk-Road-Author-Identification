				I wonder why they decide to do maintenance during the peak traffic times in the U.S.&nbsp; I am no network engineer, but one would think they would wait until the middle of the night U.S time or early in the morning to do their maintenance.&nbsp; Maybe the server is being so overloaded that it is easier to shut down the site until the traffic dies down.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				While it can be annoying most of the downtime recently has been due to intermitent tor issues due to the botnet that moved to the tor network recently, so SR isn&#039;t to blame for that.&nbsp; Of course, at the moment it was intentionally taken down for some reason, but over the past several days I think it was all tor outages.

I haven&#039;t been on SR for a while now, but I run a few relays and visit a number of hidden sites regularly and can definitely say tor is creaking under the pressure of the botnet. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Might be the guy behind Skynet, or just someone massively emulating the idea. Tor is a convenient shortcut for lazy exploiters to ante-up security for their scams. With some effort, though, a network like this could have been turned into a very secure, resource rich p2p ecosystem.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Just have to wait and see how/if the tor project deals with this. Until then SR &amp; every other hidden service is probably going to continue running sub-par, unfortunately. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;\
