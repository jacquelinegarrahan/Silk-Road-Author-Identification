				Dear all,<br /><br />I don&#039;t often weigh in on the drugs side of things but I thought I&#039;d post about this new wonder drug which came up in discussion yesterday in a thread about Adderall:<br /><br />I can strongly recommend the new wonder drug &quot;Reveeson&quot;. <br /><br />You don&#039;t even need to buy this on Silk Road, you can make this yourself using common materials found only in your own home, all you need is :<br /><br />- A functioning brain<br />- Your textbooks and course work<br />- A pen and note paper<br />- A quiet room<br />- A chair and table or desk<br /><br />Mix these in equal amounts.<br /><br />Make sure you apply Reveeson liberally at least once a day. You&#039;ll find Reveeson is most beneficial when applied for longer periods just before bed (2-3 hours).<br /><br />Side effects include:<br /><br />Increased grades<br />Better work life balance<br />Heightened numbers of qualifications<br />Elevated career prospects<br /><br />Sorry, I can&#039;t help being a bit naughty sometimes! :-D<br /><br />V.

The potential uses are near infinite- for instance if that Saudi exchange student decides to borrow that book on aeroplanes (WHAM! In the clink with them and throw away the key!) Oh you want to be a Pilot do you? How would you like a one way ticket to having some Redneck&#039;s tubestick up you in Sing Sing instead? <br /><br />Other potential uses include looking further into people borrowing Hitler&#039;s Mein Kampf -&nbsp; are all these Aryan skinheads with &quot;88&quot; tattoos on the back of their neck REALLY White Supremacists or perhaps they&#039;re faking it? The Library Card never lies!<br /><br />Anyway you had a question... if you cannot lay your hands on paper textbooks safely you can use a digital substitute though I find it&#039;s not as easy to choke down. <br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

If only(!)<br /><br />Your reaction is pretty much par for the course when I try to tell jokes (especially to women!) and so I apologise for the confusion! :-D<br /><br />V.
