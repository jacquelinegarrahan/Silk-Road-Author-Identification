				I really hope to see more gun vendors on Silk Road. I would love to have more of a selection. I also have many friends that are interested in buying guns on Silk Road. I am confident that if more guns were listed they would be sold. Alot of people want guns and many are willing to pay prices higher than retail. <br /><br />So for all you sellers out there if you have a good connection for guns try selling on Silk Road. You may find that guns can bring very high profits and low risk if you are very skilled. But just like drugs, if you are not skilled the risk is not worth the rewards.

				Guns don&#039;t kill people, other people kill people. In places where guns are banned for civilians, most homicides is done with axe, kitchen knife or bare hands. Banning guns does not prevent killing, it just makes it more bloody and violent.<br /><br />Guns might be good profit for skilled sellers. If they will be sold on Silk Road I will buy a gun sometimes later.

				Goodness people. Really now. <br /><br />Do as I do. Ready?<br /><br />I have no intention of ever buying a gun on SR. But I absolutely support the right of someone to sell arms on SR.<br /><br />See? Easy.<br /><br />You don&#039;t get to pick and choose what can and can&#039;t be sold on SR. Don&#039;t be stupid and self serving. There are those that don&#039;t want you buying illicit drugs on SR. But I&#039;m sure you&#039;re all the more willing to defend someone&#039;s right to sell drugs. <br /><br />And this notion that gun sales will bring down the heat down on SR... possibly. But so will a kid who buys drugs on SR and overdoses on it and dies. <br /><br />Be smart. Get with the program. Don&#039;t be a hypocrite. SR is about freedom for all. Which means everyone. Not just the things you personally like. Let the market dictate what will and what will not sell on SR. <br /><br />Or go start your own personal exchange where you can dictate to your heart&#039;s content. <br /><br />And as for the poster who wishes a slow and painful death on someone who may sell or advocate the sale of guns on SR; think about what you posted. Think deeply about it and see it for the true ugliness that it is.&nbsp;

The SR have enough enemies, weapons does not matter so much in my opinion.<br /><br />For people who can spend 200$ and legally buy weapon in a store this is no big deal. For someone who will never be able to legally buy a gun in his country this is big difference. Buying gun on street is even more dangerous than buying drugs on street, you might get robbed from your cash and catch the bullet from the gun you intended to buy.<br /><br />Please keep the guns on SR for a while!<br /><br />I like guns because they are marvelous pieces of engineering (well, most of them are), I don&#039;t intend to use them for killing.

				While I am 100% fine with every single person on earth owning a gun, I don&#039;t think they should be here. For the most part drug sales on this site are victimless. Imagine a murder happening and the guy saying he bought the unregistered gun here. There would be a shit storm. Keeping counterfeits/CP/guns off of here will help this site stay around much longer.

				I think anything should be allowed to be traded on SR. Guns,Drugs,Tools,Books,Apparel,ECT ECT Even more like.. Alcoholic beverages and explosives. The latter via dropspot. This market should be seen as an open commerce for people to come and sell their goods.&nbsp; 8)

That&#039;s pure speculation. Some of the drugs sold on here may have a high probability that their production directly or indirectly harmed someone. Take cocaine for instance. Somewhere along the path of its creation, someone may have been exploited, bribed, tricked, or worse, killed. Those that produce it are notorious for the crimes they commit in establishing and maintaining their hold on their interest in the market for it.

Honestly, it looks like nothing more than a straw man argument for the purpose of forwarding one&#039;s sensibility towards guns. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">*Guns create more heat than drugs because someone taking drugs is making a choice.

Or we can stick to the creed and purpose of SR to be a free market. Key word is &quot;free.&quot; <br /><br />And if you can &quot;get drugs off the street&quot; as you say, why are you so worried about LEO coming down hard on here because of gun sales? Go get your drugs off the street and be done with this place since it doesn&#039;t at all seem as if you understand or support the purpose of SR.&nbsp; It appears that all you care about is maintaining your convenient access to your illicit drug(s) of choice. <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to harsh on you in particular, but I have yet to see a valid argument against gun sales here other than straw man argumentation used for the purpose of forwarding one&#039;s self serving interests and worldview, hypothetical scenarios with nothing to truly substantiate them and good old fashion fear mongering.

				People who want guns banned on here are just hypocrites, drugs have potential to destroy your own life and harm a lot of other people just as well. We can start banning anything on here that has the potential to hurt and there wouldn&#039;t be any trade going on here left.

Neither would I trade in child pornography which I personally find to be one of most deplorable things. But, I know full well that there are many who think that my trading in illicit drugs is evil and perpetuates evils of all sorts. So rather than be a pathetic hypocrite that I could be, I subscribe to the spirit of SR&#039;s free market principles which let market forces dictate what will or won&#039;t be sold. <br /><br />It&#039;s great to see posters who truly understand what Silk Road is about. While I understand and perhaps even share the fears of others, I set those fears aside for the greater good of the movement that SR is.

				Would be nice if you would site the source.<br /><br />In any event, yes, that is the case. But then the UK has its issues with a very high rate of fatal stabbings. Look at any statistic to derive actual numbers. Worse still is that while fatal stabbings are horrific, there are a lot more UK citizens who didn&#039;t die from the stabbing events and live to suffer the after effects of the event. Sure they are still alive but their quality of life in many instances is severely degraded. <br /><br />I noticed that for a long time, SR sold all sorts of stabbing weapons and knives. Switchblades especially. A favorite of the shadowy UK slasher-type. And this is even though the seller&#039;s page politely asks that items that can cause harm not be sold. (They are obviously not banned). <br /><br />Why bring this up? Because we can always find some stat or figure or study that highlights violence or some particular type of violence. But the fact remains that humans everywhere have a high propensity for violence. So we don&#039;t want to run around banning everything that may cause harm since of course we&#039;d ultimately have to ban humans. <br /><br />Remember, it all started with kicks and punches, sticks and stones.&nbsp; We&#039;re a bad lot, we humans.

				my point is you got bunch of sheep grazing in the grass doing fine and then you want to put a pit bull in the mix. why? why do we have to have this argument? Dont we have enough to deal with already? isnt there other places to buy guns?you dont see bombs or kiddy porn here so there is a line drawn here. its just out of place.&nbsp; theres a much more clear and imo better place to draw it which is obvious by all this controversy. put another site up if you feel that strong about it. i know thats a big order just making a point.

				Consider SR as living entity, sum of parts, parts being are all those people involved in its existence. You have to give it some independence now, when it is no longer dependent on one persons decision (yes, I am sure, that there is no such thing as single SR Admin). If SR is mature and strong enough it will survive all the heat you can possibly throw at from press, LE or GOV. If it is not strong enough, then sooner we all know that, better for our safety and peace of mind.
