				Could be a good idea that we all head to the same place instead of splitting up. Voting will be up for 2 weeks - please motivate your choice.<br /><br />LATEST EDIT: Added a third poll and reset the vote counts, wouldn&#039;t be fair otherwise. Was roughly 55-45 in BMR&#039;s favour earlier.<br />

				I agree about Not us not Spliting up as one post said..<br /><br />Now as far as sheep im just making another account there, i checked it out when it first started and wasnt much.. Looks really good so far. But BMR has been around A good while and i feel was the only contender with SR.. I just hate the Way its setup the whole Face of it.. But fuck its got escrow and all.. But it just seems more un clear about ratings and all..<br /><br />Sucks this has happen.. I planned on making a order with SUBS soon.. Im hoping someone vendor will buy debt prepaid cards and let us known respect buyers that had gotton to know, let us send them the RELOADIT an then the dope, but i would only do that for subs.. Any other vendor all bets are gone now that escrow is out the window.. <br />

				sheep came up YESTERDAY. there were people there but could be feds, nobody is known there. stay away, we must stick together.

				Oh i see, i knew it was out before yesterday but was not sure how long or if any known people were there or they tried pushing it prior to SR&#039;s closure. we try and stay up to date on whats going on but have never heard of it. Just seems fishy. BMR is no golden goose but its a good alternative. Time is everything, they have had time to find the bugs, security flaws, etc... i just wish they would raise the seller fees at some point, maybe not just yet as people have lost a ton of coin, but soon.

				I have not tried BMR as the registration form is disabled. So I don&#039;t know what the layout inside is like other than the forums.<br />I would also like a new SR, but will use BMR for now since that is what the community seems to recommend.<br />Sheep not having escrow seems like a major minus.<br />Above all, the lesson from yesterday must be that 1 site is not enough. This leaves us too vulnerable.<br />Also 2-3 competing sites may motivate development of useful features.<br />For example, does BMR have a bitcoin tumbler like SR had?

				Sheep&#039;s listings increased 3 fold in 24 hrs. The site is blazing fast, has a great layout but a weird ratings system (1-100). I&#039;m not aware of any escrow control.

Lol, and it&#039;s kind of funny how they all opened their accounts 2 days ago. So they all flocked there. But sheep seems to run better and it could grow into something great.

				I understand that BMR has been around a lot longer, but I just simply hate that site for several reasons I&#039;m not going to name here. I tried Sheep, and I actually like it there it&#039;s not SR, but it&#039;s a hell of a lot better thanb BMR I can tell that much, at least.. Regardless, we all need to stick together until something better comes along, but that also leaves LEO time to make a site that could bust us all.. It&#039;s quite the conundrum.. For now, anyways. I nominate Sheep, but like Sheep I will follow the herd. :) All I ask is that people actually try both sites before you vote for BMR just, because it&#039;s older, and you&#039;ve used it before. It&#039;s also slower, too, so keep that in mind. DPR we miss you dude!

				I don&#039;t know about Sheep marketplace. There is a good chance it could be run by the Feds. I came out just recently. Now they seized SR servers. They created sheep marketplace to lour vendor here so they would create the same Username they did on SR and probably use the same password. Now they got the vendors password. And use that to get into vendor account on the SR servers. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re going to be alot more raids. coming. I&#039;m just going to sit back and see what happens. There is a reason they are leaving the forums up. To further there investigations.

				I thought sheep marketplace was actually around before Atlantis? I could be wrong, but I just thought it wasn&#039;t as popular and now of course everyones jumping ship and looking to go where they can. Either way I agree, it&#039;d definitely be wise to lay low and see what happens. Sheep def does have the nicer layout, but I&#039;m not sure if that means its better?

Next week they&#039;re each going to be very different. And again so the week after. And the week after. One of them went from 2000 to 4000 cannabis listings in a single day (and the 2000 was massively up from when SR was still up).<br /><br />For this reason I think it&#039;s worth keeping an eye on BOTH sites and not to make any hasty decisions. The SM/BMR of Oct X 2013 will be VERY different to the SM/BMR sites available in November and December, etc.<br />

				I voted Sheep Market.<br /><br />I only heard about the demise of SR yesterday. What a stab in the digital e-guts out of nowhere. I&#039;d only really heard of BMR other than SR, so assumed that would be the go-to place for most people. But since checking them both out, I&#039;m swaying towards Sheep. Mainly because my current most-trusted vendor TheHerbalist has already been there for a decent 5 months... I&#039;m certainly happy to trust their opinion. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re on BMR too, but for the sake of holding SR in our hearts, and for DPR... BMR are still the enemy!&nbsp; :P Nah... the website is nicer n easier to use. Could be a trap, could not... I&#039;ll just go with Herbalist.<br /><br />The only problem with a &quot;new SR&quot; to me is, how could that be any more trustworthy than Sheep and the other new-er sites? Unless it was created by DPR (yes, okay...) or a proven DPR friend/affiliate... Anybody could whack together &quot;the official SR2 - now even safer!&quot;. In the mean time, I&#039;m running low on weed. Herbalist on Sheep it is.

				I have been using both sites for the past few days and Sheep is faster, looks better,&nbsp; and just got updated so has a LOT of the features it has been missing. Already placed two orders with one completed. I&#039;m glad it&#039;s growing, but all the vendors split up to BMR and/or Sheep so there still needs to be some cross-reference to get all the deals.

				I&#039;m going to both... but then I&#039;m only here for research anyway and not purchases. <br /><br />A few people have suggested that it would be better for most people to go to the same marketplace. I would have thought the recent troubles with SR suggests the opposite, and that it&#039;s good to have a bit of diversity and healthy competition between marketplaces. Indeed, only having two options seems like too few.

				I had a few chats with BMR concerning the 33 symbol deposit address. I was trying ti send btc directly from my btc exchange, The exchange kept telling me 33 was not good. BMR suggested I send btc to a wallet first and then to BMR, I did that with 33 characters and it worked BMR deposit address has now changed to normal 34. Why all that I do not know.

Registered at Sheep, had a look around and then for some bizarre reason all of the screens have gone blank, anyone else had that?

The Feds are nowhere near close to defeating the TOR network. They can only unmask individual users, and even then not with anywhere near 100% effectiveness. They used a zero-day in Firefox that has since been patched to infect PCs with malware that &quot;phoned home&quot; with the real IP and OS version (you know like hosting a .onion site with CP--since that&#039;s what they were after--and having users downloading files?). That&#039;s how they got Freedom Hosting. They took down SR because the site administrator was careless. He made it easy for them because he was using a VPN WITHOUT TOR. He logged into the SR server and his personal Gmail account from the same public WiFi (from the exact same IP -- SR was set up initially to only accept admin log-ins from one, specific IP, meaning that using TOR was impossible because a static IP was needed). That had nothing to do with TOR. And they arrested him in a library while logged into his laptop (and as SR admin *I believe*).<br /><br />So yeah, if they can exploit another zero-day in FF, they can distribute malware again; but they have to actually infect your machine for that to work (which is almost impossible running TAILS on a live DVD). And yes, they run exit nodes and can spy on clearnet traffic/analyze browsing patterns, but they can&#039;t run enough to unmask most TOR users. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216461.msg1595833#msg1595833">Quote from: HassleHoff on October 08, 2013, 06:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> There is no guarantee that they did not put some code on SR - or on this forum to try to get the real IP of users (Sup FBI :).

Also, if you have JavaScript (and Java which is disabled by default) disabled and don&#039;t download anything, don&#039;t run any applets, don&#039;t connect any external drives from other sources don&#039;t open any attachments, etc. this is not likely. You can have security through obscurity if you only use TOR in a VPN for .onion related business and use a separate browser for clearnet browsing. But you should do all of those if you&#039;re vending (VPN+TOR especially).<br /><br />If you&#039;re a small-time buyer, what does it matter? That&#039;s not what they&#039;re focused on/interested in. If you read the actual complaint, they pretty much give away how they got him.<br /><br />They took down the site and arrested the person running it and a handful of vendors, but most of us are still here.&nbsp; :D<br />

				I would once again like to stress my distrust in SM; BMR has had to shut down inactive customers/non vendor accounts while SM still run at full capacity. Something is up here, why would they have the server capacity for 1000 times the user amount they previously had? Afaik SM has been running smoothly 24/7 since the raid happend - that shouldn&#039;t be remotely possible!

The Feds are nowhere near close to defeating the TOR network. They can only unmask individual users, and even then not with anywhere near 100% effectiveness. They used a zero-day in Firefox that has since been patched to infect PCs with malware that &quot;phoned home&quot; with the real IP and OS version (you know like hosting a .onion site with CP--since that&#039;s what they were after--and having users downloading files?). That&#039;s how they got Freedom Hosting. They took down SR because the site administrator was careless. He made it easy for them because he was using a VPN WITHOUT TOR. He logged into the SR server and his personal Gmail account from the same public WiFi (from the exact same IP -- SR was set up initially to only accept admin log-ins from one, specific IP, meaning that using TOR was impossible because a static IP was needed). That had nothing to do with TOR. And they arrested him in a library while logged into his laptop (and as SR admin *I believe*).<br /><br />So yeah, if they can exploit another zero-day in FF, they can distribute malware again; but they have to actually infect your machine for that to work (which is almost impossible running TAILS on a live DVD). And yes, they run exit nodes and can spy on clearnet traffic/analyze browsing patterns, but they can&#039;t run enough to unmask most TOR users. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re wrong about Tor hidden services being safe. Read the arrest affidavit for DPR. The FBI identified the SR servers before DPR was arrested. In the FreedomHosting case, the one piece of information that is missing is how they found Eric. The Tor exploit was injected into FH sites AFTER they took control of FH. How did they find Eric&#039;s servers?<br /><br />And how did the FBI locate the SR servers? How did they locate the initial server in another country that they took an image of back in July? <br /><br />Read the government information on these two cases and you&#039;ll see the one piece of information that is absent is how the U.S. government was able to locate the servers hosting the hidden services.<br /><br />Tor may is ok for surfing forums, but I would not trust it to host a hidden service. Not until further information has been revealed.

They are being deliberately vague on the methods they used to locate the SR servers. Ive seen speculation that the DDOS attack last spring (which DPR described as very sophisticated)&nbsp; was related. If Ross Ubrecht does not go to trial (plea bargain) - which is very likely , they will never have to disclose any information about their methods.&nbsp; There is good reason to believe Tor hidden services are *not* safe , at least for the people hosting and administering them.&nbsp; <br /><br />As of yet there have been no reports of mass arrests of vendors or users from the SR site. Only a handful of arrests of vendors have occurred. But we know that the FBI has ALL the PMs and unencrypted orders from July 2013 onward. The US govt has admitted that they store digital images of *every* piece of mail sent in the US. With this info they could work backwards and examine images of all the incoming mail to each buyer who was dumb enough not to encrypt his/her address. This might give them enough info to track down some of the vendors. I know that evidence that A sent a package to B would not prove anything in a court. But it might be enough to start an investigation. For an example of how these postal investigations&nbsp; go - just look at the Sadler - White complaint. Even though all the mail was sent with fake return addresses , they still managed to track down the vendor. <br /><br /><br />
