				Preface:<br />I&#039;m posting this up on the forums cause at the moment i&#039;m unable to access<br />my account to contact admins privately. Also i recognize this is type of query is more suited<br />for the &quot;Technical support&quot; section but I&#039;m unable to get any replies there and i&#039;m getting desperate :(.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping an admin or moderator can help me out here.<br />My username is Jesusjoints.. I&#039;ve been a member on silk road for over a year now.<br />In that year I&#039;ve done dozens of successful transactions and put a lot of money through silk road<br />but most of all i made a lot of valued connections and relationships with<br />many many of the vendors on silk road. I&#039;ve also tried to remain very active on the forums.<br /><br />As of recently I&#039;ve been unable to access my account.<br />Supposedly it is suspended. This has caused me a lot of stress considering<br />i&#039;ve worked for over a year to build up an extremely successful reputation on silk road..<br /><br />I&#039;d just like some information..<br />If a silkroad admin wants to discuss what&#039;s going on with me i&#039;m more than happy to chat.<br /><br />I just NEED to know how long this suspension is going to be for? Is it permanent??<br />I was about to make a number of orders and have money currently held in mtgox.<br />This supposed suspension has really set me back a lot and i just want to get things sorted<br />and know that my account in good standing. Anyways i don&#039;t know what else to say.<br />The account is independent and only run by one person. If someone (moderator/admin) could help me<br />out right now I&#039;d really appreciate it.. cause in all honesty i&#039;m stressed about<br />my future with silk road :/.<br /><br />Peace.<br />-JJ

				Does it actually say your account was suspended, or can you simply not get in? If you lost your password, I dunno what to tell you.

				Why would they suspend your account?<br /><br />Either it&#039;s been done by accident, or you&#039;re a known scammer&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Hopefully they might see this and get the situation sorted out.....

				I can&#039;t get in however <br />i can prove to an admin the account is mine.<br />due to the fact i have the history of every password ever used on the account.<br />i have history of every PIN set on the account.<br />i have lots of history of past transactions and amounts of BTC put through to the account on certain dates. etc..<br /><br />Also i&#039;m not a scammer for the record. <br />That&#039;s one of the main reasons i want the account back.<br />cause people know i&#039;m not a scammer, i have a really good reputation on it.<br />If i was scamming people and got suspended because of it that&#039;d mean the account <br />would have a pretty bad rep.. and why would i want the account back then?<br /><br />And yeah, hopefully admins will see this so i can sort it out ASAP.<br />I&#039;ve just private messaged all the admins and mods on this forum in the hope of getting some sort of response.

				There was no message that actually said suspended?&nbsp; <br /><br />It sounds like you&#039;re guessing what happened when actually all you know is that your password stopped working.<br /><br />1)&nbsp; How do you choose your passwords?&nbsp; <br />2)&nbsp; Do you know what a strong password is?<br />3)&nbsp; Where do you keep it written down?<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53355.msg521906#msg521906">Quote from: BlarghRawr on October 14, 2012, 06:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Does it actually say your account was suspended, or can you simply not get in?

				not sure what SR is like.<br /><br />but normally passwords are hashed and passed passwords discarded, so knowing the history of your passwords probably wouldnt help prove anything.<br /><br />
