				Hi,only joined this site a few day ago and before that i&#039;d never heard of Bitcoins,anything to do with them or even Tor for that matter,im getting to grips with everything,got my ewallet set up etc but im finding getting the actually Bitcoins in the UK to be a real pain and very lengthy wait.I&#039;ve noticed people in the US have loads of options to use to get them from pre-paid cards to the Dwholla (?) checks or whatever,they only thing i can seem to do in the UK is either an International wire or a bank deposit for use with Britcoin but not sure how it works?<br />&nbsp;Can someone direct me to a reliable exchange or whatever with a few different options to pay like paypall,WU or even Ukash etc,somewhere where i can get my Britcoins pretty quick instead of having to wait till next week,i wanna place a bloody order lol&nbsp; :-\<br />Cheers

				get ukash.&nbsp; Exchange to Liberty Reserve with ukashexchange.eu.&nbsp; Liberty Reserve is accepted at both Mt Gox and Tradehill.&nbsp; The only issue you have is that this could cost you about 15% in exchange fees.&nbsp;

				Thanks to you both...I have managed to get some now through bitmarket.eu which was pretty easy once i got the hang of it,except i keep email from them saying iv&#039;e&nbsp; bought some when i didn&#039;t think i have lol but i think that&#039;s because i put an offer on the board for a certain amount for a certain payment?But i thought that after i&#039;d been offered them and payed it would stop,obviously not.I also got an email not even through Bitmarket,just direct to me with someone&#039;s bank details saying pay &quot;amount&quot; No actual figure just said &quot;Amount&quot; so whoever that is can do one lol.<br />&nbsp;Britcoin is ok but i think you have to deposit money into the bank in person rather than online don&#039;t you? I made a small purchase just to try it out anyway.<br />&nbsp;Thanks again

				Having similar problem - tried bitmarket.eu but I can&#039;t get account verified (think that is new due to scams).&nbsp; Tried getting BTC for ukash on SR and they are either not operating at the mo or no feedback or big price.<br /><br />Will try liberty reserve thing with ukash. <br /><br />I thought I could just go to an exchange and give my card details (yea I know its not secure) and get a load of bitcoins....I got that wrong.<br /><br />Is there nowhere I can just buy these things with paypal or something..easily?
