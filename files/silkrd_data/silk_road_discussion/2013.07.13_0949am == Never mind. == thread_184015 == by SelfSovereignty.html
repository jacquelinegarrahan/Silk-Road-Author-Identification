				So I just noticed that purchase stats now include a time frame.&nbsp; Great, that&#039;ll be useful for vendors I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; So here&#039;s my question: how exactly was it determined what I have purchased within the last month, 3 months, 1 year, and longer than 1 year... if records of purchases are only kept for 3 months?&nbsp; Am I mistaken in that they&#039;re supposed to be purged at most every 3 months...?<br /><br />This detailed information shouldn&#039;t be possible unless the records are kept for at least one year and include, at minimum, the BTC value at the time of purchase.&nbsp; Am I missing something?<br /><br />Admin comment plz?&nbsp; :)

				That&#039;s a valid point you make, so i&#039;m interested to see what admins have to say.<br /><br />My gripe with the new system is that my refund rate has gone up x100 times since they took away the decimal place.<br />Before the change, it was 0.01%. Now it is 1%. Not a huge deal, but it doesn&#039;t reflect the correct amount I have been refunded, which was very little.<br /><br />Sorry for being so pedantic! :)

				Okay, people don&#039;t seem to be following me here.&nbsp; Someone is lying.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; The reason follows.<br /><br />There&#039;s multiple categories.&nbsp; There&#039;s always been a running total of autofinalizes, refunds, amount spent, and number of transactions.&nbsp; That&#039;s fine, we all knew that information was kept.&nbsp; I swear I also read somewhere that the actual records of the purchases were purged after 3 months.&nbsp; They certainly drop off the account history after that amount of time.<br /><br />So here&#039;s the problem: in order to calculate what purchases took place between 3 months and 1 year, and which ones took place longer than 1 year ago... you cannot just keep a running total.&nbsp; The fact that this information was able to be calculated at all means that it is a LIE that purchase records are purged after 3 months.&nbsp; It is a logical contradiction.<br /><br />I want an admin comment on this, or someone to point out how I&#039;m being retarded and am wrong.

It&#039;s been stated that purchase records are not kept for more than 3-4 months (I remember 3, Astor says 4).<br />2. In order to be able to distinguish which specific orders were made more than 3-4 months ago, but less than a year ago, you HAVE to know which orders were made more than a year ago.<br />3. If you know which orders were made more than a year ago, you&#039;re keeping the records.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.:.&nbsp; Either the data was 100% made up and complete bullshit (I doubt it), or one of these assumptions is false.&nbsp; Presumably it&#039;s 1.&nbsp; That&#039;s basically a lie.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of a big one, too, since it&#039;s a lie about what details are kept regarding orders.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if it&#039;s never said anywhere that records aren&#039;t kept for more than 3-4 months... well then there&#039;s no lie, and apparently we all got the wrong idea via some sort of dark net osmosis (or something...).<br /><br />When did I last see it?&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; It was there this evening.&nbsp; I can&#039;t give you an exact time.&nbsp; Awfully curious that it&#039;s gone now, though... mm?&nbsp; Thanks DPR.&nbsp; At least the illusion that you guys give a fuck is now no longer a direct contradiction... :D

				If you are worried about your old info being saved, I strongly suggest you create a new account every once in a while. It&#039;s the only way to be sure.<br /><br />Yeah, it sucks having to start over with fewer than 10 purchases and many vendors requiring FE, but if you have purchased multiple times from some trusted vendors, you can send them an encrypted messaging, telling them you are going to start buying from a new account, and let them know which one. If they&#039;re cool, they will waive the FE requirement.<br />

				It&#039;s been brought to my attention that just because purchase information that would be helpful for balancing books and keeping track of profit margins and tracking scammers all that is kept, does not mean that anything we should really, really care about is kept.&nbsp; I feel that my initial reaction was too aggressive: I think that&#039;s perfectly reasonable for DPR or whomever else to keep.<br /><br />My objection, should I even have any, is solely to being told the records aren&#039;t kept when they are.&nbsp; Now to be fair I don&#039;t even remember where I read that and don&#039;t want to go digging through everything ever released by the Silk Road folks to find it, but I thought it was the buyer&#039;s guide... if that makes no mention of it, then I have no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />Just in the interest of being fair and rational and reasonable and all that boring, level headed stuff... :)

But in order to be in our position genghar (the position that your stats are dropping off because they&#039;re older than a year), you have to have been here for more than 1 year. And that tends to count for a lot when doing business. <br /><br />Most vendors ask for 5 transactions and a history of more than 3 months on the road before they&#039;ll accept escrow, or something along those lines. I won&#039;t fall foul of that, and neither will you I highly doubt. And if you do, buy an e-book or something!

				I have to agree, I don&#039;t see how it could be that much trouble to keep one last data set for total purchases and how long the buyer has been on SR. I deal with accounting systems all the time and if I was to tell a client they could no longer see total sales, only the last year, the best I could expect was to be shown the door.<br /><br />

				So there&#039;s a new row in the buyer stats that lists &quot;total vendors&quot;.<br /><br />How does SR know how many unique vendors someone purchased from more than a year ago if they delete or anonymize the individual transaction data after several months?<br /><br />In order to show this number, SR must save the buyers and vendors involved in each transaction, which along with the price (and thus probably product), means they have been saving all the info about every transaction, since the beginning of the market.<br /><br />Unless DPR has been aggregating this info on a monthly basis because he predicted more than a year ago that he would add this feature?
