				I ask this because sometimes i see review where the guy says it took too long however he still gave a 5 out of 5 review. I find this puzzling. Also i find it a pain in the arse because as a newbie Im still skeptical about putting my money in BTC and buying drugs over the internet. So i rely heavily upon review to guide my decisions however when all i see is 5 out of 5 reviews all the time i found this pointless. I mean could a guy bump up his reviews somehow? What do you guys think?S

				Its worth more finding the vendors thread on this forum for reviews then on their vendor page<br /><br />alot people just instantly 5/5 as long as it arrives and its what they ask for.<br /><br />always check the forum thread in regards to quality. more times its more reliable source

				Forum reviews are definitely more informative than feedback on the market. After a while you will start to recognizing people on the forum, and you will get a sense for who the informed reviewers are. I&#039;ve gotten to know people in the community than I can ask directly about vendors of specific drugs, and I know I can trust their reviews. That saves a lot of time in the long run.

				Reviews are not as reliable when there&#039;s no good info about the item they bought. Otherwise people rave about their order. I&#039;m personally tired of reading feedback about how fast the order arrived or how the order was super stealthy. I&#039;m only interested in feedback about the product that was ordered.

Market feedback is good for a day to day reading of how the vendor is shifting packages....you don&#039;t want to see&nbsp; too many complaints or &#039;FE will update&#039;. Read back a couple of pages too. Good feedback doesn&#039;t totally mean a good vendor, but bad feedback does give a clear warning.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then the forums will have more detailed discussion of what has been happening, who has got best quality, who has best comma, who will attend to your order quickly. Once you have been here a while you get a feel for it.

But it sounds like you are referring to vendors feedback. The reason you see a lot of 5/5&#039;s is because a lot of people are very happy and received their drugs. I can tell already that you do not want to believe this. As you are still puzzled that someone said it took too long and you do not understand why that buyer didn&#039;t leave a 1/5. I will help you solve the puzzle...that guy left the 5/5 probably because he was very happy with his drugs and he realizes that sometimes things in the mail take time. Maybe he lives in Argentina and he ordered weed from Germany. In that case it could have taken 10 days and that is a &quot;long time&quot; to wait, but in reality... that is just the standard time for an order. So though he hated to wait, he got his drugs and he is not a dick or an idiot so he left the 5/5.<br /><br />Or maybe it was a buyer of mine that ordered from me at 6pm EST and he received it the next day at 11am. And because he has a sense of humor, he put &quot; took to long&quot;. As 17 hours coast to coast in America is a &quot;long time&quot;. ;)<br /><br />Astor said this<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=199506.msg1432284#msg1432284">Quote from: astor on August 09, 2013, 07:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Forum reviews are definitely more informative than feedback on the market.

As the only thing he says that is accurate is his first sentence. As Hungry Ghost CORRECTLY pointed out...forum reviews are spotty at best and should be taken with a grain of salt. As a lot of them are coming from a shill account or from someone that was given a freebee to write a review. In fact there are &quot;hero&quot; members in this forum that only get their drugs this way. As they are broke dick losers. &quot;Paging......&quot; just playin..<br /><br />But of course the OP never asked that. He did of course ask----<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=199506.msg1432220#msg1432220">Quote from: Nemesis0914 on August 09, 2013, 06:33 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I mean could a guy bump up his reviews somehow?

In fact what he does do is ignore your question and instead tells you how you should go to the forums and read them and find a &quot;trusted reviewer&quot; (that is like saying an honest politician or a smart girl). The very thing you ask &quot;if it can be bumped up&quot;...so to speak. <br /><br />What you should do is read all the feedback on the vendors page. And then find the exact drug you want and read the vendors feedback for that item. Make sure they have them!( feedback) Also since you are so paranoid and a skeptic, I would suggest you choose a vendor that has been here over a year and has a perfect feedback rating(100), has over 300 transactions, and happens to be in your home country. And most importantly....uses PGP! <br /><br />FUCK NO! ;D I was kidding about the pgp...the most important thing is NEVER FINALIZE EARLY! And as long as you follow that simple rule. You can not lose your money. And if you stick with a vendor that has been here over a year, with a 100 feedback and has over 300 transactions and you stay in escrow(meaning do not FE) then you will 100% get the drug you ordered.

Leaving bad reviews hurts their reputation, and typically vendors prize their positive feedback percentage and are more than willing to make up for their mistakes in most cases. If an order doesn&#039;t go as planned, send a PM to negotiate and let the vendor know what happened.

				Product feedback on SR can&#039;t be trusted much, several people have told me they tested some of the best rated hashes on SR and most of it was decent at best. I&#039;d say the feedback is mostly a pointer on whether people get their product at all or not. This obviously has to do with how anything under a 5/5 rating is considered bad, and a lot of vendors would even blacklist you for a 4/5.

				On Amazon we call these &quot;false positives,&quot; i.e. the feedback is numerically positive but the content describes problems or complaints about the order. This keeps the seller&#039;s stats from suffering, but also lets him or her (and other prospective buyers) know that you had some issues. It&#039;s helpful, I suppose. So of course it&#039;s a good idea to actually read feedback comments, rather than just look at the numbers, but as others have said, feedback is rarely all that helpful.<br /><br />Whenever I buy on SR, I address three things in my feedback: stealth, shipping speed, and product quality. This is the information I want when choosing a vendor, so I suppose (perhaps wrongly) that this is what other people want as well. I see lots of feedback along the lines of &quot;Dayum! Booyah! Some shit right here!!!&quot; While this seems more positive than negative, it doesn&#039;t really communicate any useful information.<br /><br />We&#039;ve probably all known people (perhaps including ourselves) who are surly and unhappy while waiting for drugs, but as soon as the drugs arrive, they&#039;re happy, happy, happy! Never mind that it&#039;s not the product or the amount that we were supposed to get. Never mind that we&#039;ve been sitting at this picnic table in the park for the past two and a half hours. The drugs are here! The whole world is beautiful! This experience probably translates to online sales as well.<br /><br />Ultimately, listen to all the people who have mentioned the most important thing. Don&#039;t finalize early! Your money might be trapped in SR limbo land for a while, but at least it won&#039;t be gone forever.

				a 5/5 on a street deal is: I didn&#039;t get shot or robbed and I got what I purchased even thou it was under weight. <br /><br />So, I&#039;ll take a shipping delay any day and give a 5/5 as long as it&#039;s at weight and what I ordered. <br /><br />
