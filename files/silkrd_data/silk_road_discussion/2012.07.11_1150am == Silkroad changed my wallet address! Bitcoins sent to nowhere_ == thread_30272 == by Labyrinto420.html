				So for some reason my SilkRoad bitcoin address changed? I never changed it, do they change by themself?<br /><br />I sent $200 to the address I had saved in my address book, then went on to SR to check for funds when I noticed the address looked different.<br /><br />Is there any way SR backs up old address or something? I hope I didn&#039;t just send $200 to nowhere.<br /><br />I&#039;ve contacted SR Support via the SR messaging system but I&#039;m just looking for some answers now, because SR is so god damn slow with getting back to me through messages.

				How long ago did you send it ? <br />It should show up after a few hours or so I&#039;m sure.

				I sent it around 1.5 hours ago.<br /><br />That&#039;s not the problem though, if you read my thread. The problem is that SR changed my wallet address (I have NEVER clicked &quot;get new address&quot;), so now I have sent funds to my old SR wallet.<br /><br />The address I sent the funds to was different to the address which appears in &quot;Account&quot; on Silkroad. I repeat, I have NEVER changed my SR wallet address so I have no idea why these addresses are different. I have sent funds successfully using the old address several times, and only weeks ago.

				Your bitcoin address changes after every transaction, though the old one is still connected to your account :) Nothing to worry about mate.

				Thankyou so much! Appreciate the help man, I had no idea they changed, never noticed that.<br /><br />I&#039;ll post back here if I don&#039;t see the funds in a few hours.<br /><br />Thanks :)

				I did read it :P . And I&#039;m still sure it will show up after a while. I think all of the addresses changed automatically but the old ones are still valid. It happened to me :)

				hey I didn&#039;t want to make a thread cause it&#039;s prolly been made plenty of times here and it seems this is an appropiate to post this. what&#039;s the longest you guy have had to wait for the funds to be added? It&#039;s been pretty much 3 hrs and i&#039;m getting kind of concerned. Any input is appreciated, thanks.

				SR takes so goddamn long to respond because a bunch of noobs send them stupid messages like these, instead of being patient and waiting a few hours you flip out. Just chill and hit a bong while you wait for the coins to show up, its all good ;) For future reference its a good idea to change your address after every transaction anyway, i hope you haven&#039;t been sending the coins to the same wallet the whole time...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30272.msg338360#msg338360">Quote from: turqiun on July 11, 2012, 05:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">hey I didn&#039;t want to make a thread cause it&#039;s prolly been made plenty of times here and it seems this is an appropiate to post this. what&#039;s the longest you guy have had to wait for the funds to be added?

Try to occupy your time and check back in an hour or two. It&#039;s really frustrating when you get the coins and the order you we going to place is gone because there was only one more left =D

				Bitcoin works by writing all of the transactions into the block chain. To avoid double spending, the standard is to wait for 6 blocks to get written to make sure that the transaction is valid and the coins have only been spent once.&nbsp; SR waits for these 6 confirmations. How quickly blocks are written depends on a lot of things. Blocks that include a transaction fee (some fraction of a BTC, usually around .01) are picked up quicker than those without, and get written faster. If you&#039;re using a bitcoin client, try including a transaction fee to have your block picked up faster. I&#039;m not sure about the transaction fees with online wallets. It usually takes about an hour for my transactions to get picked up, and i include a fee of .001BTC<br /><br />tl;dr SR waits from BTC transaction confirmation from the network. Include a transaction fee to speed things up.
