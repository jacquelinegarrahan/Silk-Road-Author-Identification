				UPDATE:&nbsp; Thank you everyone for making the sale a HUGE success!&nbsp; I want to give a warm and special thank you to all of the vendors who pulled together at the last minute to offer up their sales.&nbsp; My apologies to those that ran sales but didn&#039;t make it on the list, hopefully the word got out anyway.&nbsp; Next time we&#039;ll give more notice for vendors to get deals together, and customers to get bitcoins.&nbsp; We love you guys!&nbsp; See you around the site&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />ATTENTION:&nbsp; Please do not message vendors asking for their free samples.&nbsp; They will list their samples in the market for 0 btc when they are ready to :)<br /><br />Let&#039;s face it, the Silk Road vendors and staff are here for the customers.&nbsp; Without you, we&#039;d be out of business :(&nbsp; Each and every person that takes the plunge and makes a purchase is standing up for themselves and setting an example for their fellow man.&nbsp; The commerce that happens here is out of the reach of the oppressors and control freaks of this world.&nbsp; The bigger our world gets, the smaller theirs gets, and YOU are making that possible.<br /><br />To show our love and gratitude for you, we are discounting every item on the site by up to 10%.&nbsp; On top of that, many vendors are running special deals for the weekend:<br /><br />3Jane&nbsp;

				Silk, do you think the timing on this is going to work? I mean we already have a pretty big influx of traffic from the gawker/forbes articles (I presume that was why the server was struggling today). Won&#039;t this compound with the huge spike in regular users for the weekend sale, thus probably lead to server outage or at the very least a lot of slowdowns. Not getting in up your grill about it, just curious as to how you&#039;re preparing.

				I think I just shat myself&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Good thing I just made a Dwolla transfer so I&#039;ll have some funds available for this. While true that the influx could likely slow the servers down substantially, I think this is a great promotional idea. I love how SR is so open yet so untouchable. The gov&#039;t can&#039;t win. EVEN IF they eventually do win this battle, the war that has been started against the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; will inevitably be victorious. SR, know that I consider you a true pioneer in the fight for 21st century freedom. &lt;3

				Unfortunately, I won&#039;t have my stock until the following week. I will, however, offer a deal as well. The only bad part is that the buyer wont be able to get the free &quot;Tax&quot; so, I will deduct the sr tax from my listings. so, if i offer 5 percent off, you will really get 15 percent. I will pay sr&#039;s fee for you...<br /><br />This will also help those that are having issues getting their pin reset and bitcoins into their accounts..

				Wow this is great. Any way a mod could make the first page a little more user friendly? Like a blank line between sellers? Another idea would be to list what categories the sellers are selling goods in? That&#039;d be very useful I think, especially as the number of participating vendors is increasing as the date grows near.<br /><br />Thank you to SR and the participating vendors. I may begin my selling career this weekend, as soon as I figure out a secure shipping method for pills (generic adderall 20mg IR).<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)<br />Comment: GPGTools - http://gpgtools.org<br /><br />mQENBE8ngYoBCADA4i9uxVG4p9ki7XX7w0ZUHlFzARW5x4W3ljGiUiLs1jd26qP1<br />YJlS5u7OkeaiQurBh8PDMlk/y7Wu7Njg7krFJRB7RbIn7lb2Fof50+NTMrhm6/fn<br />KaDOrS7bj4fZedp/i55mXzV0gLFkVCH91ALVndmLVu2u5k5DDQJzVETEVcAUpN7y<br />7jUlD1iHITQAlmKsYNTBTlkWAhl661FKQxkBkfBeYC3Yt+826Si2Eb1yS7x8/oVY<br />Da0sFQDvTk5EuU+0Rj6Bu8V9MTett513+QofD/hqul73JKUYc29l3w5aRkbAcJp4<br />k2dyYlzQ8B0jsfDSHIIHwsGiaCeJsLUY1eLJABEBAAG0HFNSa3ZhbCA8bm90aGlu<br />Z0Bub3RoaW5nLmNvbT6JAT4EEwECACgFAk8ngYoCGy8FCQeGH4AGCwkIBwMCBhUI<br />AgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJEDVa4mma0Q1Udz4IAKzNs9jwy+//ezDYbKM7fCmJ<br />uieTIAw7cSao3aTU9rhRk0uhljrk1PVDr0dSfIaca9DZsxIWK5Z8H0aWOgE/4e/8<br />849w8479349dHAOd3FTQJ0wi6SyoSInOGBrreKLGsF7DJrs/aI392p2xilDQ5jmb<br />FnGIcUXwE23dNV9ulMsoaI+l4JPdjAJNpaOEu1Z3dFbX2Ngm+eeidNePdNMYtK77<br />UVhONL87Vbse1EDFPYVximlvUw2BNE86Go/9gVDGrL67vhs/ARPM6rhN9mCHobyl<br />lPdYxw2DKAHfDO4/kFDJNVOAkV/qwpoxAmadBhqsadMQDKbAfyXKZfR6IzxQHiO5<br />AQ0ETyeBigEIAPNy8b20FSHB3O/mwq3iIaAYQkEC9Fcxtww+cKwtwEF76OMle4mo<br />IV4/TgB8uFP7S/c98+1N3efFUrfjQAozC9sws1ld5DHPJgxmEIaa03Vy1icbB00G<br />zt69T+Ar1r2aqOE6h221fdb9dLIKrzNLo139iaLgGDWdeO06l2Aa6ZFOPb/10Pf5<br />TOUrsCtyiSXAJxL7aSgVQoJc+HFUpV1CkTvxnjkPKmlWIlOSvetlbuv9RU5RqDDG<br />JkcddsVGbjAdhw+l1eSsdApu6jLn4JEHtq/YVmRddBcSyEa/hkcbrMcAv6zZ2P3b<br />eP8FmGfUtbgj/53KQHR3V2YgbFQw7L5NJ3cAEQEAAYkCRAQYAQIADwUCTyeBigIb<br />LgUJB4YfgAEpCRA1WuJpmtENVMBdIAQZAQIABgUCTyeBigAKCRBDUFoIOddYq9Oh<br />B/oCRePaeInSThElp6nD1YpoGnOi+Skuzh5AINMeTf71hXPn9PZyOZEoMX9QvhZY<br />u7KHE/A2ovtgf3d5/4e34Gb5n/XabKrq6Iv5JdkeGEE6KIUFVP3yhPQuSkF+Ui+4<br />L9oE1ZiXCJrzLFdy/yDovuHskEoM+mEgE0TKse06cJkG12VLp7EpSiPPMu95+Ie1<br />c8xjK6stqEYANhHUGL9oDRMLTL9/QRyaKGy6cQZwadKdVJDG1EcEknZwif+xwzEI<br />3b3UDzBwRVyymRtPTHNcdOMrynn0aGfjzCLYCwBMeaW9nYtpiZtnHYh2l9v/w9eR<br />q747xLYpH2fzqHCOZKltT4zFdU0IAMCwUzxp92SvlMMXznsm69ZQT2b5lPL105Dk<br />p6/2JrkgNpa0Z4o5kRGFE1fNQ/+TnSOr24f3JdQHFJxdTh8+AWI509rhNRgAU7S4<br />/Af0MpQR0Fcn0vzIpCWzJ2lJ/tAzysKQY7SRKz8yxBVYrOY09lH/tVTWcH9R40Cz<br />Hbvv1znRAe5YjmeHdpHYxq8S5MQjXQ6af1SnJc4Z+xW9ZBOMzLcw4rZqDa3tFodl<br />SPJxeYUeXucTJLhH5LNYjKwcOxPesgfd7pYrUzpWyCiuzc0Wo7GFRLZkp6KUknSR<br />OKWchB7uxptHCMk3RHzNh0PptL19mzPgXdIpE4UHHuxhwkhABEA=<br />=+8rb<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

				I&#039;m not sure I understand. So Silk Road is paying out of their own pocket, 10 percent of each listing that I might buy? Couldn&#039;t this be abused by a person with a seller and buyer account running a large amount of BTC from the buyer account to the seller? The buyer pays 90 bitcoins for a 100 bitcoin listing(and SR pays the other 10btc) and the seller(same person) receives 100 bitcoins for the 90 they originally started with?

				I haven&#039;t really sent out anything other than samples in my short time on SR, but for the sale I&#039;m going to add a listing for 4 grams of cubensis; Aussie or Mazatapec strains.&nbsp; $25 a pop with free priority shipping.<br /><br />I will also look into putting up a listing for an Indica strain called Granddaddy Purp for $50 an eighth with free priority shipping as well.<br /><br />Hope the site can handle the load this weekend ;)

				This is incredible!&nbsp; I&#039;m so psyched that my bitcoins came in last night and I&#039;m all ready for this weekend.&nbsp; Thank you SR and all the vendors who are participating in the sale this weekend.&nbsp; <br /><br />And might I add how excited I was to finally log onto the main Silk Road discussion forum and not see the conversation dominated by numerous redundant Guns vs Drugs threads.&nbsp; Cheers to unifying the community!<br /><br />

				Hi SR members!<br /><br />Actually we wanted to give a freebee to your 300th customer, but we will also drop prices by &gt;=10% for the weekend! But your stocks are already low, because we sell only our own bio Weed and home made Hash.<br />Oil is sold out.<br />Outdoor weed is sold out.<br />Be early! (America/Australia) has a advantage - do not wait until Sunday, because most&nbsp; stuff will be gone.<br />We promise to send all orders on Monday.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />Our Customer Appreciation specials are now listed!<br /><br />Ben and I had a discussion and over the past 6 months the one question that was asked more frequently than any other was &quot;how many valium do I have to buy to get them for $1.00?&quot;&nbsp; Well, with the Customer Appreciation weekend that answer is now here: 50.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are two listings, one for 50pcs and one for 100pcs.&nbsp; We have made all the prepacks so they are ready to ship on a moments notice.&nbsp; <br /><br />As you many know, we did not have a lot of time to prepare for this weekend but it just so happened that we had gotten a big shipment of valium in so we have a very large inventory to work with.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are offering ALL OF IT on the special, except for a small holdback to hold us over until the next shipment arrives.&nbsp; <br /><br />So...you asked for it, you got it!&nbsp; $1.00 valium all weekend or until they run out, whichever comes first!<br /><br />And we love giving good deals so we&#039;re very happy to work with SR to bring you this fantastic deal.&nbsp; And these are not some special Pakistani knock-off nonsense brought in for the low price, these are the same original Roche 10mg valium we always sell...just at a much cheaper price.<br /><br />We are still listing the 10 and 20 packs at the regular prices if there is someone who really just simply doesn&#039;t want 50 pieces but I can&#039;t imagine why anyone wouldn&#039;t take them.&nbsp; Heck, if you don&#039;t want them all, give them to a friend, they only cost a buck! :)<br /><br />Happy shopping everybody!&nbsp; We hope you all save a ton of money this weekend.<br /><br />&gt;Alex &amp; Ben&lt;

				Sadly none of the advertised free samples are really there. I was online last night at the beginning of the sale and there was nothing, so I thought they may need time, but still nothing there now. Petty disappointed :(<br /><br />As I need some new acid in the coming month and I&#039;m not sure yet where to buy from (GammaGoblin is my Nr. 1 right now), I wanted to try some of the samples TheEmporium said he would give out. He had them listed on Friday so I wrote him if the sale is already on or if I should wait until Saturday. No response and no samples till now. Well, case closed, I think GammaGoblin gets the order.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like false promises.

				A lot of the sales are still running. I&#039;m keeping my prices the same until the stock I had set aside for the weekend is gone, which will probably be quite some time.

				Customer appreciation weekend was very good to me...2k :D<br /><br />I upgraded all the packaging BTW. They are now all shipped in padded envelopes with DCN. Even if you paid the old $1.20 rate you still get the upgraded packaging.<br /><br />Also 3 hits will be included with every order as I promised. I am working on getting all the packages out but I have 50 orders total. I spent all afternoon prepping the envelopes, buying stamps, wiping everything down w/ alcohol to prevent any inadvertent fingerprints, inputting all the addys into P-Touch, and I just made all te smarties. The AMT smarties are kind of bitchy as AMT doesn&#039;t like to dissolve as well as 2cs...so I had to use 4 times as much alcohol and put it on the smarties in stages. <br /><br /><br />CHEERS :D<br /><br />PS: These nitrile gloves really are awesome...feels like I&#039;m wearing nothing at all.

				Hah, now does anyone want to do a Canada appreciation day :D<br /><br />All my orders except one were cancelled (even though the vendors said they were making an exception to their regular international shipping policy) and I only ended up being able to spend maybe 1/10th of the BTC I worked the week before to get into my SR account.<br /><br />I love my country, hate shipping, hate Americans more.<br /><br />But fuck, I am not one happy camper right now grrrr

I&#039;m not in Canada but I&#039;m on the same boat as you, down to the details - like a vendor saying they&#039;d make an exception from domestic-only and then going back.<br /><br />Still, I did get two good orders going at a good price, so I guess we take what we can get.

				I am always down to ship to Canada. Only costs a couple extra stamps. In fact I charge the same for Canada shipping as I do for USA shipping as there is no DCN on Canadian Orders.<br /><br />Stop right in, your welcome here :D
