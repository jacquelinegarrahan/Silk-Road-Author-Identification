				I&#039;ve been lurking around for a couple of weeks, and I have noticed an influx of new members recently. Things have gotten out of hand when SR is discussed on fucking reddit and mainstream news sites. Does anybody else feel there needs to be a change of name and address. <br /><br />I mean this is tactics employed by military contractors like Blackwater. They change names on a regular basis from Blackwater to Xe Services and these days these vultures call themselves Academi. Imagine that. <br /><br />It is a very simple yet profound tactic. What are you thoughts on this? Any insights, comments, thoughts?<br /><br />Peace,

				As a buyer I agree but as a vendor I would disagree&nbsp; &nbsp;We need new customers to feed the new vendors nDPR needs more people to keep coming if he is going to keep selling vendor accounts.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree .&nbsp; There are over 20,000 vendors here now. Yes more than that. It&#039;s true.&nbsp; &nbsp;Almost everyone is a vendor now.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />A private site is a dream come true.<br /><br />BIT SADLY.&nbsp; I think the solution and inevitable future is to divide this community up into smaller groups at many different sites run by vendors themselves.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Each vendor could easy run their own site on the dark net.&nbsp; It would<br />Be harder to attack each of them, but they could hire &#039;pushers&#039; to troll the forums and clear net sites for customers to invite people back to the site and get free drugs for doing that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then it wouldn&#039;t be possible to attack everyone.&nbsp; Safety in numbers.&nbsp; People don&#039;t see it that way though.&nbsp; I think a private site could be even safer as it could<br />Be other technologies instead.&nbsp; <br /><br />DPR and Silk Road could then focus on laundering services and bitcoin banking.&nbsp; Move on to bigger things

So what point was there in changing? Its certainly not secret...<br /><br />SR has been discussed in the news media going on a while now. The original Gawker article was in June, 2011. Almost two years ago. This media attention might seem new to you, but it is nothing new.<br /><br />Changing names would not solve anything. It will still be found, else how is it going to continue being a business? Or is it that you want this change to be secret to all but a select few? I suppose you want to be one of those few, right?<br /><br />Mainstream attention is good for SR, tor, and BTC. I mean, would you trust a site that has had no pressure from LE and nobody has ever heard of? It shows that the site can be trusted. It can survive even in the glaring light of constant attention from the man. That should give people confidence in it.<br /><br />The cat is long out of the bag. Who cares if reddit talks about it? So what? LE is not just hearing about it from some subreddit. The only downside to widespread attention I can think of is that newbs who have just found it might get themselves scammed, since the barrier to entry is much lower with illustrated how to guides, etc. <br /><br />

				Things like this tend to be victims of their own success.<br /><br />There&#039;s one thing I&#039;m certain of, and that&#039;s that the SPIRIT of the silk road will live on long after this specific site is gone.<br />Already new markets are springing up, but one way or another DPR will get this straightened out, even if it involves changing to a semi-private site for a time as he suggested it might come down to.

So that was definitely not what I was thinking. <br /><br />Simply changing the name and address every few months could have a great potential to divert the attention of mainstream media. Hell this tactic has worked flawlessly for BlackWater and the likes for years and decades.<br /><br />I am not certain how easy this would be to do in technical terms though.<br /><br />Your idea about splitting the site is a very good one indeed. It would divert attention and make this type of attacks redundant. How would we still stay under the same umbrella?<br /><br />Peace,

				SR being discussed on giant public internet mediums doesn&#039;t bother me, it&#039;s the fact that fucking kids and young adults are openly admitting, on fucking open internet blogs/forums, that they buy illegal shit off SR and it&#039;s &quot;amazing and so cool&quot;, also a fucking felony everywhere.<br /><br />It boggles the mind that people are able to find the means to join Silk Road and have active transactions on it, yet still lack possession of half the mind it takes to know you keep your stupid-ass mouth shut about it.<br /><br />Goddamn.

				I think 1. People need to be descrete about their membership to sr outside of tor and 2. Maybe make sr an invite only site or something? What do you guys think?

				LE has known about this site for a while but all this talk of it is rubbing their faces in it.&nbsp; Simply it makes them look bad and insults their authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;The easiest way to piss of a cop is to make them feel that somehow they are not the one in total control, at least in the USA,<br />&nbsp;I have found cops in other places to be a little more rational.&nbsp; But the American cop, they have this job because A. They were bullied or B. They were the bully.&nbsp; We need to worry about the American police most because groups like the DEA pressure other governments to follow their policy even though they have no jurisdiction in that country. <br /><br />But there really is nothing they can do, the technology SR runs on was meant to be used during a war to transmit troop movements.<br /><br />Anything made with a computer can be broken with a computer and a smart enough hacker but it will not be easy.

				I totally agree with the invite idea, Torrent Trackers, the good ones use it. Invites should be give by purchase stats, and activity, The reddit, needs to go. Invites screening process should be on a tor like irc, tested on dosage knowledge, PGP, and should be given sparingly. Invite screening should cost amount of btc. This would make sure that the new member understand how to get btc, how to use pgp, and is not going to over dosage and die. All noob friendly tuts need to be locked down and removed. Sorry guys, we need smart people here that are technology inclined.&nbsp; We need people that learn by research, not by getting there handheld. This is just fine tuning this machine. Cutting out the fat.

				Invite only would be great but in the end less sales mean less SR fees. It&#039;s not going to happen. I really suggest befriending your favorite vendors and getting their tormail/torchat information.
