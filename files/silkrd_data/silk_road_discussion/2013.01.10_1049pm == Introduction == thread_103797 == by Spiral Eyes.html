				Hey peeps. First off, I apologize if there is some stickied thread somewhere for newb introductions. I did a search for it and couldn&#039;t find anything. I&#039;m new to this forum, but not to forums. I&#039;m aware of search functions and all that, so hopefully you won&#039;t find me creating too many redundant threads. I&#039;m balls deep in research and forum reading, and am hoping to be ready to roll here very soon. I&#039;m looking forward to chit chatting with yall here and there, and thanks in advance for answering any stupid questions I will inevitably ask in the future. It&#039;s always a little overwhelming joining a new situation like this, trying to weed through old posts and new posts to get to current and accepted methods and solutions,etc. There are always conflicting viewpoints on any given idea and often more than one way to fry a cat. So I&#039;m digging in...<br />&nbsp; In the meantime, however, I do have a question:&nbsp; Since yesterday, my browser has said that silk road is down&nbsp; for maintenance for 6-8 hours. Obviously, it&#039;s been well over that. Is this something with my browser, or is the site down for everyone? I was curious as to why the forum is still accessible. <br />&nbsp; Also, i kinda figured that I should focus my business domestically ( USA ) and stay away from international orders. But today I read a thread review on Albionessentials that indicated it&#039;s perfectly safe to order overseas. Is that a generally accepted practice. Is it smart to avoid over seas transactions? <br />&nbsp; Ok, thanks guys and gals. See you around !&nbsp; :D

				Welcome !<br />I haven&#039;t noticed any down times recently with SR. And I m in right now. Just keep trying. I suppose you have the right address : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br />If I lived in US I don&#039;t think I would ever buy overseas, as long as I can find what I want. If you can avoid customs why not? I haven&#039;t read that post from Albionessentials (link?) but I m sure domestic is far less dangerous than Intl.

				Hey spiral, welcome to the silk road. I&#039;m pretty new too, but here on the forums we all try to take care of eachother and make sure we are safe and secure in our dealings. I hope to see you active and around.<br /><br />As for international orders, I personally stay away from them. I don&#039;t want to risk my order going thru customs, plus the shipping prices are higher and the shipping time is longer. I think staying domestic is for the best. Tho it appears that people have had success ordering internationally. It is a throw of the dice, however, and I think we are taking enough chances in the first place. But to each his own. The only question you gotta ask yourself is: is it worth it?<br /><br />Cheers, new friend!

				Yea, that first order is a leap of faith, always a little nerve wracking. I don&#039;t know what you have heard or what you plan to do, but even though it sounds risky your best bet is to ship to YOUR address with YOUR name, because if the name is fake it could attract suspicion, and if it is not being shipped to your address, well then you are just bringing more people or things into the mix that are unnecessary. Plus unless you have a friend to ship it to, whatever name you use on a package not being shipped to your own place of residence won&#039;t match to the occupants registered there. Remember, as long as you are not shipping to a PO box, you always have plausible deniability that you know what is in that box or that you ordered it or anything. In most cases the worst that will happen is your package will be seized, and a lot of vendors will work it out with you if that happens to get you some money back, or to reship your goods. Crazy cool, huh?<br /><br />Just make sure you order from an established vendor with a lot of positive reviews. And you can vet your prospective vendor further by checking his reviews out on the forums. All the best vendors will usually have a review thread in the &quot;Rumors&quot; section of the forums, so search there. If you are smart and do your homework, your first order will be smooth and easy, and you will be able to enjoy your new freedom to get your hands on whatever it is that makes you happy. We are not all worthless drug addicts here, we are intelligent, hardworking people who are not satisfied with government approved alcohol as our only form of intoxication. Make sure to use responsibly!<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what kind of drugs are you into?

I don&#039;t know what you have heard or what you plan to do, but even though it sounds risky your best bet is to ship to YOUR address with YOUR name, because if the name is fake it could attract suspicion, and if it is not being shipped to your address, well then you are just bringing more people or things into the mix that are unnecessary. Plus unless you have a friend to ship it to, whatever name you use on a package not being shipped to your own place of residence won&#039;t match to the occupants registered there. Remember, as long as you are not shipping to a PO box, you always have plausible deniability that you know what is in that box or that you ordered it or anything. In most cases the worst that will happen is your package will be seized, and a lot of vendors will work it out with you if that happens to get you some money back, or to reship your goods. Crazy cool, huh?<br /><br />Just make sure you order from an established vendor with a lot of positive reviews. And you can vet your prospective vendor further by checking his reviews out on the forums. All the best vendors will usually have a review thread in the &quot;Rumors&quot; section of the forums, so search there. If you are smart and do your homework, your first order will be smooth and easy, and you will be able to enjoy your new freedom to get your hands on whatever it is that makes you happy. We are not all worthless drug addicts here, we are intelligent, hardworking people who are not satisfied with government approved alcohol as our only form of intoxication. Make sure to use responsibly!<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what kind of drugs are you into?<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I HAD planned to have the packages sent to a girlfriends house, to her real name. But if you are telling me it&#039;s safe to have them sent to my own house, I&#039;d rather do that. <br /><br />I have been reading a lot on venders that I&#039;m interested in. I have already found the reviews in the forums etc, and am using it. <br /><br />As for my drugs of choice, I&#039;m not into anything self destructive really. I stick mostly to consciousness expanded material.&nbsp; I&#039;m mostly into hallucinogens. I make my own DMT, mushrooms, Salvia... I&#039;m mostly here for weed, and am interested in MDma, since I don&#039;t know anyone around my area with it. Also, I have a really bad back, and was hoping to find cheap vicodin or equivalent... but seems to be more expensive here than I can get on my own. I&#039;m really surprised at that. So anyway... I&#039;m just a mid- 30&#039;s guy loving the idea of mail order drugs&nbsp; ;D I appreciate the info. <br />&nbsp;
