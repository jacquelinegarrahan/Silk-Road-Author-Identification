				I ordered 5gs from the vendor Mindguru. I only received about ~1.5 grams (1.4). It was in a vacuum seal and there was nothing else in the box he sent me except for a little wooden statue. I thought, clearly there must be some mistake. He must have just sent me one gram (gave extra because i was a new customer maybe?) and forgot that I had ordered 5gs or misplaced my order to another buyer. I teared through the box multiple times after being told that there were 2 more vacuum sealed bags... I felt truly perplexed. I looked again, and again, and still have the packaging. Finally I decided to enter the resolution center. I went into resolution and described thoroughly and accurately exactly what had happened. After about a week in resolution center, and being called a &quot;bullshit artist&quot;, with basically zero end of Mindgurus side of the story, I received a message informing me that I am to receive a zero percent refund. Zero.<br /><br />Right now I feel sick to my stomach. I lost out about 80% of what I spent. About five hundred dollars... How is this possible? I feel literally sick to my stomach. How is this possible? The vendor has 100% positive feedback. I can&#039;t believe it..<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m just venting, I feel so bad... I just wanted the money back..

				It doesn&#039;t really help that you have +1/-6 karma with only 17 posts. If what you&#039;re saying is true, I feel for you man. I&#039;ve lost 500 bucks because I was stupid enough to finalize early for fucking YKKZipper, and I didn&#039;t even get a gram of what I wanted from that. So at least feel lucky you got some product.

				That sucks.&nbsp; Makes you wonder what the whole point of escrow is, if you still have very little protection.&nbsp; Of course this is assuming you&#039;re telling the truth.<br /><br />You should have asked him how much, to the closest hundredth, each of the three vacuum-sealed bags were and see if he slips up or something.

				Damn that sucks for you bud. A vendor shouldn&#039;t be sending multiple small vac sealed bags either as it&#039;s fuck all you ordered.<br /><br />I would have brought this point up with SR staff, but then if I have a financial issue that needs serious attention, I PM DPR since he&#039;s the money juggler anyway and at the end of the day makes the calls on serious issues like this. $500 is peanuts to some and a weeks wage to others, and if you have a H problem then I suspect that was your monthly rations and therefore hit you hard. <br /><br />DPR&#039;s incognito and obviously doesn&#039;t want n00bs bothering him so I can&#039;t give you his direct account link, but you can PM him here too and he will always do his best to help you out as he does for everyone when you&#039;re talking over $500 but it&#039;s too late now to do anything so put this down to a learning experience.<br /><br />duderugs took me for over $600 on my first buy, so you can appreciate I nearly stopped using SR right then and there, until I put it down to a learning experience and now FE for FrankMathews and Asylum only.<br /><br />If you buy smack, coke or MDMA or from anyone other than FrankMathews you&#039;re wasting your time, money and vein capacity.<br /><br />If you are truly ill, take a mixture of Fentanyl and OC if you can get a Dr to prescribe them for you and join a health fund. There&#039;s also a compound you may want to look into called Bromadol that&#039;s 10,000 times the potency of morphine and legal in most countries esp those without an analogues act, Heroins&#039;s only 3X. Fentanyl is 100X the potency of morphine to give you some perspective on it&#039;s potency.<br /><br />There&#039;s always another way, and if you&#039;re going to get Bromadol be extremely careful when 1g of this compound can make you 10kg of morph.<br /><br />You can thank me later...<br /><br />Merry Christmas yo! :)

Good thing he&#039;s got absolute SHIT feedback now, I wouldn&#039;t want anyone buying from him. I should have realize he sounded sketch when I first was messaging him about ordering.

I cannot send the crysals/rocks as it is, for the sake of stealth i have to crush them.<br /><br />2. This person is lying - he has changed his version of the quantity 3 times - first he said &quot;under two grams&quot;. then he said &quot;1 gram&quot; and now he is stuck on 1.4 grams<br /><br />3. I never even made a package that was 1.4g, it is not my standard size listing and i never pack such odd quantities<br /><br />4. in SR feedback, he says he was scammed for 1000$. his total transaction was about 750+shipping. here he says he was scammed for 500$.<br /><br />5. When he ordered, at first he wanted me to send him the product &quot;without tracked shipping&quot; while being allowed to stay in escrow.&nbsp; I refused, since I would have NO PROOF OF PRODUCT BEING DELIVERED. He kept on insisting that i send it without tracking, when i was firm with my answer, he VERY RELUCTANTLY agreed for tracked shipping. HE IS STILL TO PAY ME 30$ for tracked shipping, which he has YET NOT PAID.<br /><br />6. It was on this guy&#039;s mind to scam me from day one, which is why he wanted me to send such a large order untracked, so I would have no proof of the item getting delivered or not. would be very easy for him to raise a dispute if I had no proof of the item getting delivered.<br /><br />7. Now he could not claim that the item was undelivered, so he went ahead and raised a dispute of the quantity being not proper. This is just bullshit.<br /><br />8. I have close to 120 transactions, I can challenenge this guy, call even ONE OTHER customer of mine who can say what this guy is saying - that i selectively scammed him - or i sent the wrong quantity.<br /><br />10. Read my feedback, read my forum feedback, you will find numerous instances where people have said that they received OVER their ordered quanity, I ALWAYS PACK A LITTLE EXTRA....ALWAYS!!!!<br /><br />11. If someone is ordereing 5g from me, and tells me he will order more regularly, WHY THE HELL WILL I SCAM HIM?? I am here to do business, most of my customers are regular customers, that is because I DO NOT SCAM PEOPLE.<br /><br />12. even when I offered 50% refunds for undelivered packages, I ALWAYS REFUNDED 100% to any customer who had a genuine issue. If you are a genuine person, I will go above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied.<br /><br />13. THIS GUY IS A BULLSHIT ARTIST! UNBELIEVABLE!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />MindGuru, I apologize.&nbsp; I should know better than to be getting involved in stuff like this &amp; defending somebody I don&#039;t know.

				It took a customer of Mindguru&#039;s 2 days to find his order.&nbsp; That taught me 2 things: The stealth is awesome &amp; some people are wicked fucking patient. 2 days ? I would have gone bananas. <br /><br />Mentioning anything about the shipping should be edited, no ? <br /><br />Drugs make people lie &amp; think of nothing else. Always keep that in mind, its why I could never vend without looking my custie in the eye so I can see if they are lying or not. Keep up the good work MG, you know you are respected by many around here.

				I dunno man, blacklist the dude till he changes his feedback ? Do you think that a lower feedback rating is going to scare custies away ? I know that I&#039;ve ordered from vendors that had one bad feedback but all the rest were fine. <br /><br />Then again my only resolution case was with a 99 rated vendor who I had done a previous transaction with &amp; absolutely refused to answer my messages &amp; marked my order as &#039;in transit&#039; a couple days after ordering so I couldn&#039;t cancel.

I was messaging him once every day trying to annoy him into giving me my refund, and he just jerked me around.
