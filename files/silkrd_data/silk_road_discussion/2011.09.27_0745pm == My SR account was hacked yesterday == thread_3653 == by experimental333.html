				Someone withdrew the BTC from my account without my consent.<br />I am certain it wasn&#039;t a phishing attack, I always use a bookmark.<br />My password was some other site&#039;s onion address, so it could have been broken by a dictionary attack, although I doubt it... (the adress has been inactive for some time)<br />Fortunately I had less than 2 BTC in the account.<br />The admins should look into this issue, I can give you details if you need them.<br /><br />Lesson learned: never keep your BTC in SR wallet, and always encrypt your messages!

				Same thing happened to me, yet I was stupid enough to go through a &quot;legit&quot; Silk Road that was posted on the Hidden Wiki. Like you, I had less than 2BTC left, so it wasn&#039;t a huge loss, and you can&#039;t really buy anything good with that anyway. Password changed, lesson learned.

				I&#039;m not claiming my account was hacked but I had something strange happen to my account yesterday. I had a PM in my inbox that was marked as read although I couldn&#039;t possibly have read it - I was fast asleep at the time. I didn&#039;t have any BTC in my account so no harm done. I changed my password so I hope this is the end of that.<br /><br />I only access SR through a bookmark and am careful about keeping my computer clean so... I have no idea.

				Probably a good idea to change you password a couple times a month even if you take all precautions. Also, I never, ever, keep more than 1 or 2 bitcoins in my account. If I have 1 bitcoin, thats too much. Doesn&#039;t take too much time to transfer it to your wallet. But for those that keep hundreds of bitcoins in their account are just asking for trouble.
