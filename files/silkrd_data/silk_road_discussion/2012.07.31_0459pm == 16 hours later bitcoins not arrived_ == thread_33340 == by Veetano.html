				I sent some(about 42) bitcoins over to my SR account last night, after those $1million worth of bitcoins got sent through the network. <br /><br />The coins have not arrived in my SR account nor have they been returned to my original address. Are they probably still being transfered in the network and just really delayed due to the huge transaction last night?<br /><br />I&#039;ve read bitcoins cannot actually be lost. Also, if anyone can give me any pointers on how to use the blockexplorer.com then please say so. I searched my BTC address and it didn&#039;t show any sign of my BTC amount.

				I am in the same spot. I sent some BTC to SR hours before the btc-e hack. Coins were received by SR wallet but they have not been credited to my account. I contacted support, no reply yet. I think we must be patient. Situation fixed soon, hopefully.<br /><br />To check that coins were received by SR do this link<br /><br />[clearnet:] http://blockchain.info/address/YOURADDRESSHERE<br /><br />***<br /><br />EDIT: The coins have now appeared in my account. I bet yours will soon too.&nbsp; Thank you DPR!

				Thing is, I sent about 200 coins to my wallet while the hack was happening, and they arrived within the next 30 minutes..... but after that 64k coins got sent through the network, my 42 coin transaction has not gone through nor has it been registered in the blockchain.<br /><br />Neither of the associated addresses in the transaction have showed up... so if it doesn&#039;t show up soon then I&#039;m going to be contacting my exchange(which isnt btc-e).<br /><br />I also havent been able to access SR in a few hours so i&#039;ll just wait it out and see
