				Just signed up at SR with a new buyer account, got a welcome message, expected it to be by SR, but no some stupid messaage from &quot;Welcome Wagon&quot;, what is ths all about<br /><br />firstly its meant to assist new buyers, but it heavily pushes a few select sellers only, completely unfair to the other 226 sellers out there.<br /><br />Secondly, athough not nice to be a new buyer, we shouldnt encourage them to buy shite for 0.01 btc to build up threre buyer stats, this is actually fucking bad for sellers who get a false stat, as anyone could get high stats overnight buy buying torrent invites etc<br /><br /><br />I thinks this need rewritten urgently, SR please advise this crap, hey sellers you aware of this crap??!! How come i get spam the moment i join SR now with a new account, shady,<br /><br />i would post it here, but i would have to edit it first to make it fiar.<br /><br />

				welcome wagon is weird. It would also be safe to assume that welcome wagon is run by someone who has some type of authority on this website and that that person has some connection to each of the accounts that welcome wagon pushes. Therefore all LE can assume that if they were to bust any account featured on the welcome wagon letters that the person behind that account is close to the top of the SR pyramid. <br /><br />Welcome wagon is just like joe smo or w/e who is actually a top vendor who uses his position to get more business. Its some bullshit but SR is just like the real world where the Status Quo set the rules and influence others to do things that would help them.

				LMAO The replies to this thread are funny as shit considering none of you have any idea what the fuck you are talking about hahaha. Here are some actual facts instead of the bullshit you guys are making up.<br />- Welcome wagon is not connected to SR administration and is not in an &#039;authority&#039; position lol.<br />- Welcome wagon is just a BOT that was made by a member to welcome new members to the site and to recommend vendors that have good feedback.<br />- The vendors that are recommended are mostly ones that the bot creator knew or ones that were in the SILC chat when the bot was created.<br /><br />This thread was a good read though lol.

				I believe the bot gets sr usernames by registration date/time. If you go to the memberlist and organize by date registered you can see the newest members, which is how is believe he gets the names.<br /><br />On to getting scammed, has sugar mama contacted you at all? Or have you posted a scam report or anything here on the forums?

				You cry unfair now but what if you decided to use a less credible vendor? Then you would be in here crying out scam. Welcome Wagon recommends some highly respected members of the community, nobody says you have to use them but those are the ones you can count on to come through and maintain a solid reputation on there.

				:)&nbsp; Life isn&#039;t fair feel free to create your own bot *ANY* time you want :) and recommend whom ever you want but people on there have met my criteria and frankly they have given no reason to for me to *believe* they would be scammers :) and if they are i can just as easily send a message out saying that they are and remove them from a list <br /><br />also i can&#039;t very well explain how the bot works but it really really simple there is just a million bugs that had to be worked out prior to deploying <br /><br />as of current the bot has sent 21,962 messages to new users only 57%&nbsp; read the message or at least open the message and as far as my sales go only 4.9%&nbsp; of those have purchased from me which is actually fairly high considering <br /><br />not going to lie i like making money like the next but i also do have good intentions to welcome people to the site and just explain some basics :) I also reply to *every* single person whom messages me back which is roughly about 200 people a day .. so if you don&#039;t like it gtfo :)<br /><br />thank you,<br />-warweed<br /><br /><br />BTW the welcome wagon bot is being restructured :)<br /><br />as per the WW bot I also have a bot that handles and processes all my orders automatically and stream lines the the buy and deliver process

				Oh and I have every right to make money like the next person obviously im going to educate and make it a *bit* in my favor frankly bitcoins are going to pay for my wedding so I do what i have to do <br /><br />The message will be changing soon as per a *new* welcome wagon bot deployment <br /><br />the current message is<br /><br /><br /><br />Dear $User,<br /><br /><br />Welcome to Silk Road! Please take the time to review this message as it contains some important information for first time users.<br /><br />Silk Road is an anonymous marketplace where you can buy and sell products anonymously.<br /><br />To purchase items on Silk Road you will need to acquire a new currency called Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses encryption and no personal information to make anonymous transactions over the internet.<br /><br />You can obtain bitcoins through a variety of ways. You could register with an exchange site like Mt. Gox , Tradehill.com, Cavirtex.com (Canadian Market) or Get-Bitcoin.com and use one of their many funding options.&nbsp; Or you can buy a money pak at Walgreens or Walmart (United States) and sell that to a MP-&gt;BTC vendor on SR and receive your bitcoins directly into your Silk Road account.<br /><br />When you attempt to buy something from SR there is one ***VERY** important thing you need to know. The vendors here on SR like the buyers to have some sort of Transaction history. Alot of vendors require a minimum three transactions. Which means you have to have at least three successful Transactions or else they want you to finalize early. This is because of the fear of buyer scams<br /><br />*****Finalize early is very high risk***** and also against the site guidelines this means you have to release the bitcoins out of SR&#039;s escrow (by finalizing) to the vendor before you get your product. If you attempt to place an order to such a vendor that has a 3 transaction min. they will cancel the order immediately.<br /><br />Catch 22. I have bitcoins and I want to buy drugs but cannot buy drugs because I have to buy something to build a Buyer History.<br /><br /><br /><br />***************************************<br />*********There is a Solution! *********<br />***************************************<br />Buy digital goods! There are some great digital goods vendors on SR one such is Warweed. Warweed sell&#039;s books on all sorts of controversial topics for VERY cheap and also sells various software. He also has a script that fills your orders almost automatically giving you an *almost* instant delivery (within two min). To receive your buyer history, you have to finalize your order after it has been received by going to your orders page and clicking Finalize.<br />To have a look and to start getting a Buyer History check Warweed&#039;s profile page for multiple pages of GREAT Item&#039;s and other Digital Goods to Increase your Buyer History Now!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/13555<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Preferred trusted Drug Vendors<br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />PaperChasing - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/60105<br />Paperchasing Is a preferred vendor and normally stocks VERY high quality Coke, Heroin, Weed, and a variety of other products<br />Paperchasing is well regarded because he only stocks the HIGHEST quality products<br /><br />godofall - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/37638/220<br />Godofall provides very high quality Coke and is a very fast shipper He is new and he has something to prove<br />Give him a chance and he shall not disappoint<br /><br />Ivory - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/1473<br />Ivory is the BEST MDMA distributor in the UK (ships worldwide) he has the highest quality of MDMA most on sr have EVER seen<br />Ivory also usually stocks 2C-I<br /><br />Pharmville - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/36712<br />Sells Oxycotons, Valium, and Percocet VERY trusted vendor<br /><br />RapidImprovement - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/4320<br />offers medicinal lines of MXE to those in need.

				Does SR have any problem with this? Does it violate any site rules? <br /><br />Some self-advertising along with some useful information isn&#039;t bad. Do the recommended vendors pay you to list them? If they do, then your choices are certainly biased and may not represent the best vendors for new members.

				Good, it just takes away business from other members as far as I see it, nobody has the technical skill to create their own bots and at the end of the day ONE PERSON/VENDOR has control over a list of &quot;reputable&quot; vendor which is not only dangerous, corrupt and unfair.<br /><br />r.e &quot;Oh and I have every right to make money like the next person obviously im going to educate and make it a *bit* in my favor frankly bitcoins are going to pay for my wedding so I do what i have to do &quot;<br /><br />Just makes you sound like a dick, New members should rather be encouraged to use the forums + use feedback systems to make up their own mind, plus a lot of &quot;legit&quot; vendors can turn scammers, so if your pumping reccomendations to someone and they fuck over a customer for whatever reason (finalise early/out of escrow) that&#039;s blood on your hands...<br /><br />...not to mention you not listing any other DECENT/REPUTABLE vendors&nbsp; for whatever reason you want be it: ignorance, forgetfulness or because the vendor has pissed you off in the past. Plus vendors trying to get on this list will have to bug/appease you.<br /><br />on the plus side I like the warnings r.e finalising early and going out of escrow but other then that there&#039;s too much room for corruption/bias and turning away business from other legitimate vendors, I&#039;m glad SR stepped in and hopefully they do their own version of the Welcome message.

				Indeed it is true I hadn&#039;t thought about it that way and you are right I actually spoke with SR in length about this <br />The info was helpful and I had alot of praise from alot of users in regards to this anyways to give you a break down of Welcome Wagon in the time that it ran it determined there were on average 437 new user registrations a day or roughly 19 new users a hour :) of those users 34% of them actually read the message within 20 min 67 within 24 hours and 73% within 72 hours with the remaining going unread of those users in the duration of running 32,342 Users were sent private messages of those 73% of the 32,342 users only 19% replied to the message of those 19% of users whom replied 98% of them were positive and asked for help or just wanted to thank me 2 % were already users i suspect and were just lik omg wtf ect ect <br /><br />of those 73% of users in comparison to my personal sales only about 1% give or take were customers <br /><br />and based of some other stats only about 6% of the users who were sent pm&#039;s were return visitors <br /><br />Now this may be confusing for some of you but all this information is very freely available to *ANY* user im not some mystical magical person or anything and I had implementations in the script that slowed the script down so it was about as fast as the average user on silk road so that it didn&#039;t bog the site what so ever <br /><br />Now with that said the vendors that were on that list were more or less filler I only has 2 requests from other vendors to be put on the list on of which was declined because he didn&#039;t meet my criteria of a reputable vendor and the other wasn&#039;t until today the vendors that were included on the list were vendors that were in the SILC chat now if more of the vendors would communicate in the SILC chat they would have the opportunity and Lastly <br /><br />All respect intended dave I am kinda a dick but i have respect for SR <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...not to mention you not listing any other DECENT/REPUTABLE vendors&nbsp; for whatever reason you want be it: ignorance, forgetfulness or because the vendor has pissed you off in the past.

				I feel it is only fair if you are going to be advertising yourself that you state YOU created the bot.<br />I still think using the excuse of building a reputation with digital purchases to advertise for yourself is misleading and sneaky, but as you said it is up to the owners to decide that.
