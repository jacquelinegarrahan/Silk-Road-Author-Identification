				Seems like a period after the image verification was put in place the spam about bitcoins were lessened, and now its back up as if the whole process doesn&#039;t exist at all? it&#039;s pretty damn annoying having to scroll through multiple pages of &quot;Official BTC Shop 10 bitcoin=$89.44 www.bitcointalks.com 1 bitcoin=$11.99 5 bitc New&quot;, I&#039;m not really complaining, just pointing it out and maybe it&#039;s time again for another brainstorm of effective ways to curb it?

				There are lots of effective ways to fix it, policy wise. Admins could rate limit accounts with fewer than 100 posts to one new thread every hour. Admins could create a Newbie section where accounts with fewer than 100 posts (or some amount of time on the forum) could exclusively post. That&#039;s how bitcointalk.org does it.<br /><br />Our problem is that nobody is watching the asylum and nobody cares. It took forever just to get the captchas.

				It does seem to be low on the priorities list of SR staff to rectify the problem. As astor points out, there are ways of minimizing the spam here on the forum. The problem is not how to do it, the problem is no one will do it.&nbsp;

				yeah fair enough then I guess as astor pointed out the captcha took forever to implement guess it would be good though to get periodic updates from mods / DPR as to which direction they&#039;ll be steering the site to

The scam is still successful. You don&#039;t antagonize a hornets nest unless you are getting a LOT of something really wonderful... SR is a hornets nest, everyone has come out to play. So they either come with a very big shield or they take the risk for a very big reward, that&#039;s how it tumbles.
