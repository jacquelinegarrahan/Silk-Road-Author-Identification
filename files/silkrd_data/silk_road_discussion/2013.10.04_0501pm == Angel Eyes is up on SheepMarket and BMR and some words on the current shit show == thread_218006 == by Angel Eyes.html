				To all of our former customers and anyone interested in sampling our smokable delights for the first time, we are up on SheepMarket (we haven&#039;t been sheared yet ;) and BMR.&nbsp; On SheepMarket we are &quot;AngelEyes&quot; with no space, and on BMR we are &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; with a space.&nbsp; We are also now on reddit under the the name &quot;AngelOjos&quot; and at angelojos@safe-mail.net.&nbsp; Our original public key is still working so that&#039;s how you can be sure its us.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to add that I am simply amazed at the way this community is coming together to fight the fascists who really don&#039;t give a damn whether we live healthy lives or die on the streets, and who use Orwell-speak blind denial of reality to convince themselves (fewer and fewer believe anything they say anymore) they are doing something positive for the world.<br /><br />Its clear now that its POSSIBLE hidden services have been hacked (though it seems his payment mechanism may have given him away -- is there really no server firm that accepts bitcoin?), but that does not end the story regardless.&nbsp; Just like all of us vendors (with a few exceptions having nothing to do with the Tor technology) are still safe, if DPR had kept a lower profile and not gotten ahead of himself he&#039;d probably be out there right now and SR would be running again.&nbsp; I&#039;m not impugning his character, and I firmly believe he&#039;s innocent until proven guilty by MY court of law in MY head (you can&#039;t trust a fucking thing LE says anytime anywhere, and most juries just lap up whatever garbage they are fed by their &quot;trusted men in blue&quot; -- fucking frightened weaklings), its just apparent that he didn&#039;t follow proper opsec procedures and apparently got caught up in extortion rackets directed towards him from LE cutouts.&nbsp; Could any of us have done better?&nbsp; With so much pressure on him to keep this magic working for all of us, who of us could honestly say we might not have made some serious errors.&nbsp; However, lets all remember Gus Fring&#039;s immortal words on how to live long and prosper in illegal business from Breaking Bad -- &quot;don&#039;t ever make the same mistake twice&quot;.&nbsp; If the &quot;two hits&quot; allegations are true, DPR did make the same mistake twice.&nbsp; His error (one of them) was not seeing the first time as a mistake.&nbsp; When we started vending here on SR we watched a long video from Grugq describing how these operations get taken down.&nbsp; I wish DPR had lived and breathed that video.&nbsp; He&#039;d be smiling and sticking a big middle finger in the FBI&#039;s dumb fucking eyehole right now.&nbsp; <br /><br />In solidarity with DPR, the Silk Road, but especially the ongoing project that is liberty and freedom, I doff my proverbial cap to all of you.&nbsp; Live long and prosper.
