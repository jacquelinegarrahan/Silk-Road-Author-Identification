				I am so sorry to leave you guys hanging for so long wondering what is going on with the site today. Let me just make everything clear and reassure you all that Silk Road has NOT been compromised, DPR has NOT been busted, and EVERYTHING IS OKAY! <br /><br />Yes, we are having some technical difficulties. We have been making some serious overhauls and changes to the system, server, and website. While I cannot tell you exactly what is wrong today, I can assure you that we will fix it and have it back up soon. By soon, I mean I would be shocked if we didn&#039;t have it back up by Monday.<br /><br />Please, I beg of you, don&#039;t start spreading any unnecessary rumors that will surely stir up chaos, fear, and confusion amongst out community.<br /><br />To quote DPR himself, &quot;We are in uncharted waters&quot;, and it appears that we have grown a little bit faster then we had anticipated. As a consequence, we are being plagued with all kinds of technical difficulties and poorly timed problems. <br /><br />Our beloved captain Roberts will be online and addressing you guys sometime in the next 48 hours to explain whats been going on and what has and is being done to fix it. Please be patient and rest assured that all will be well soon. <br /><br />Thank you for your understanding,<br />-Inigo

				I, like everyone else, appreciate the update. I do agree with another poster that a message signed by DPR would do wonders to stop all the fear and speculation but I guess that will come in due time. Hopefully OUR home will be up by the end of the weekend and thank you again for squashing some rumors, hopefully DPR will have some words for us soon when time permits but in the interim, thanks.

				I would hum on your ballsack for you after hearing this.... and I&#039;m hetero, that&#039;s how happy I am to hear this status update. Shit, you almost made me cum on the spot!!!<br /><br />A sleepless night was had by all last night me thinks. To hear something yesterday might have been nice though guys because we love this place and to lose it would be saddening and down right silly after so much work and effort has been put into the recent upgrades etc. That was what I thought this morning is why would you guys be working so hard at upgrading the site a month or two ago as well as other bits and pieces if you were just going to close it on us. This place for us is as good as the gun markets of Pakistan for a gun nut!

				I would like to take the time to ask DPR and the Admin Crew to please post a sticky thread whenever foreseeable, extended downtime occurs. Although this is the longest downtime I&#039;ve witnessed in 8+ months, it is evident that people jump to conclusions way too quickly and get scared and paranoid.<br /><br />If you could just make standard an announcement for any downtime that may occur for longer than a few hours, I&#039;m sue it would help a lot of people relax.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Whatever the cause [for SR&#039;s blackout], it&#039;s a timely example of what could happen if some of an authoritarian bent - be it the state, federal or others - get their way.

				Good news. Downtime is extremely frustrating, especially for those waiting on the shipping status of their orders, and those waiting to finalize, and so much more problems... <br />Been trying to get on there for 2 days with no luck at all, forums didn&#039;t work for me for a while either, but that was probably natural. Hope to see SR back up soon, we all have stuff to do. /:

				DPR has my full support to take as much time as necessary to fix the problem. Days, weeks, months even.<br /><br />It is important to get the fundamentals right. <br /><br />Everybody has got to realize the fact that running SR is stressful, stress can make technical obstacles seem insurmountable, your skills, whatever level they are at, inadequate, so it is important to take a break, relax completely, even when you&#039;ve got the urge to keep on going. One must always be wary of the dangers of burning out, pine has been there before, it&#039;s a distinctly unpleasant experience. We are human, not machines, there are limits to what our willpower and work ethic can accomplish, so it&#039;s taking time out is very important, it is a feature of all the world&#039;s major religions, Islam, Judaism and Christianity, they all have special days e.g. the institution of the Sabbath for a time of rest and for good reason too.<br /><br />If DPR cannot give specific dates, times, &#039;heads-up&#039; posts etc, then there is good reason for it. We are being watched by the Adversary. That is more than good enough.<br /><br />As consumers it is better to be patient than to make mistakes. It is at times like these that the Adversary will seek to take advantage using psychological methods, to spread malcontent, to persuade people to give up good security practices for the illusion of progress or an easy way out. If the Adversary does indeed use technical means to disrupt our territory, then it follows that they will also simultaneously use psychological attacks to maximize their impact. So keep your guard up and be ultra skeptical of what you&#039;re reading on this forum.<br /><br />

I would actually love to know how many users total there are vs. number of accounts with at least 1 transaction.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So what? I&#039;ve been here 2 months, I have over 100 sales I have about 30 in transit or need to go in transit, and about 10k in my account...<br /><br />Do you think I believe that you shouldn&#039;t be spared? hell no... I could care less about new accounts when i cant even deal with old ones!<br /><br />Should all the vendors suffer because you want an account??? <br /><br />I dont think so my friend.. We need to take care if the vendors... you see people will always be willing to come online to buy drugs.. and there will always be a site like this offering a service... but the dealers are what makes it all work... no vendors no nothing......<br /><br /><br />VENDORS ARE NUMBER ONE ON THIS SITE.. they are the bread and butter, and without vendors you would not be able to come here and make 2 transactions in a month.<br /><br />I do agree tho that any accounts not used (spent money) in a month should be deleted and that would stop the window shoppers from slowing down the site... but still, I would offer your account and 500 more like it in a second to get back up and running!!

Given your neg karma rate and the fact I am yet to read a positive reaction to a single one of your posts I can only conclude this is your strategy, like one of those really fucking annoying TV ads that irritates the shtt out of people but gets people talking about it. It would seem ANY attention is good attention in your book, why anyone would want to do business with someone like you after reading your posts astounds me.

				I would agree, something is being with held from the community. Maybe internal personal issues or black balling by hacktivist group. A single event knocked the servers off line and kept them off. Something is up and it is not user demand. In any case hopefully they get it sorted, if not well there are other markets. I&#039;ve made enough contacts here that I would be fine with or without the road.

				Nan i don&#039;t call myself an expert but i sure as hell would, with the budget SR had, organized things rather differently. |First fform the network operations centre in budapest, where the ISP or wherever you host this thing, have a dedicated vpn open to another server on another location that is mirroring constantly, and can take over with a different address at a moments notice. this kind of failover should be normal for a site pulling in that kind of cash. <br />then een moreso, another anonymous market has three addresses, might not help him much, but i acually looked into the development of Tor and hidden servicesare not developed yet to deal with laarge traffic. I don;t think th eoutage woould be so much, but tor has no bandwidth throttling or other management possibilities, it will grind to a halt, its amazing it took so long. The hidden services are underdevelloped and indeed ised for the first time. <br /><br />But there is also i2p, at least it would have taken 30 minutes to make the site accessible on i2p, so what we have to install another fucking free anynmuzation kit, who cares, we could have been working on the site... <br /><br />i mean what happened, is there still a button that says send, itll better be a big pastic one, on top of the server rack... <br /><br />i2p can be insalled (and is as secure as Tor serving in a manner very comparable, except optimized for serving sites, and we can all switch to i2p and continue business. Yet they are worknig on something that should just have been fied already... there is unforunately no way to do failover of any kind with requests that are routed towards hidden servers, it&#039;s a known problem but it hasnever ever been an issue as Tor was mainly sed by people to emaail relatives in dictatorships, but even before, the tor development team was aware of the issues because the Hidden Wiki was not reachable when it was busy on the network. So live and learn, take the only option you got if this is tor AND GET THE SITE UP ON I2P!

				Good god reading this thread hurts my brain. SR is now a website with thousands of users, and millions in annual sales, I am sure it has grown larger than DPR imagined it would. When sites have huge traffic like this, they can go down. You are not &quot;owed&quot; anything, so the people who are acting like they are can go fuck off, its a website for buying drugs for fucks sake.<br /><br />And in regards to coins stuck in limbo, this does suck, but you should always keep BTC in your SR wallet for as little time as possible.

				good to hear something at last! i&#039;ll stick to paranoia till the site is up though; i deal with live applications regularly and never had a need to bring a site down for maintenance or upgrades for more than a few minutes; there are plenty of no downtime release management methodologies out there.<br /><br />the only thing that would make sense is that you guys found a security hole, either by yourselves or through an attack so can&#039;t bring the site back up till you find a solution. if that hole is a fundamental one (i.e. part of the tor/hidden service mechanism, it might even turn out to be a insurmountable problem&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />that would also explain the secrecy, broadcasting information about a security problem would be stupid!<br /><br />can&#039;t believe my luck though, the last thing i was able to do with SR was withdraw all my funds&nbsp; 8) still doesn&#039;t change the fact i got nothing to smoke now&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />well, here&#039;s hoping the hole is just in your software&nbsp; :-\ i have faith in SR, they&#039;ve managed to build and protect something that rubs every law enforcement agency on the planet the wrong way; just hope the hole is fixable

				I don&#039;t know much about networking or servers or anything like that but I do know comparing the brain base and IT professionals of a major website like yahoo or google and saying they are never down more than an hour then saying why is SR still down is pretty fucking stupid.. You really think that a site mainly dedicated to supplying illegal drugs all over the world has a super large group of top IT guys/gals to just jump right in and get on the problem.. I highly doubt it and would bet there &quot;employee&quot; count to be less than 50.. Use your fucking brains and let the few people they have that can actually work on the problem, work on the fucking problem.. Oh and the site owes no one anything.. Its illegally operated and runs illegal substances to every corner of the planet, if anything you owe them for offering a place you can do that at.. be smart and read all the txts and rules and suggestions they offer and when the site goes down, you wont have a damn thing to worry about..

				will you people get over the ethnicity crap, we&#039;re a community ;) as for the threat, makes perfect sense to do it publicly, puts more pressure on the person getting blackmailed. you guys are right, this might be just some idiot trying to incite panic but equally could be true; if someone got to the DB and it wasn&#039;t designed well enough, this would put DPR in a tight spot; very much doubt he&#039;d give in but he&#039;ll have to find this guy and break his kneecaps in an anonymous network - not an easy task

				I appreciate that SR is open to all, and that sort of stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />But maybe it&#039;s time to close down registrations for a little while?&nbsp; Not forever...&nbsp; But either switch to an invite-only system, or close new invitations completely for a little while (a week, a month, a few months, whatever), to let things cool off.&nbsp; Things were working pretty well.&nbsp; When news stuff pops up (and dumb Australian detectives run their mouths), it has to bring some bad with it.<br /><br />Popular drug sites (e.g., opiophile.org and bluelight, both opiate user sites) do combinations of the aforementioned things.&nbsp; Granted I know SR depends on vendor fees and all to stay in business, but they must be making decent profits as well...&nbsp; &nbsp;Keeping things wide open all the time risks additional revenues at the cost of potentially too many bad folks coming around (and vendors losing access to their wallets, and people risking auto-finalize, etc).&nbsp; Just a thought.

				can you people please keep the childish personal fights elsewhere? i keep coming here for updates on SR status and have to wade through pages of you people bickering&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />also, even though it might simply be a hoax, there&#039;s an open blackmail suggesting the DB has been compromised and no SR response saying it hasn&#039;t. i&#039;m just a buyer so i don&#039;t really care as long as SR comes back but i would&#039;ve though the vendors would be freaking out about this instead of lack of access

				I can handle SR being down for few days.<br /><br />I&#039;m just glad that we have this forum to keep us updated on what happens about SR. Very Important for things like updates, crashes, and new URL&#039;s. <br /><br />This is alright, just give it some time guys.<br /><br />SR is the best thing to happened to Internet, drugs, and the world. We gotta appreciate what we have.<br /><br />It sucks though for &quot;New&quot; people trying to get on, thinking SilkRoad &quot;Doesn&#039;t&quot; exist, and never get back on.

				I&#039;m glad this update is here, but DPR / the Admins should probably just put the updates in a sticky that can&#039;t be replied to by so many people. It IS rough not hearing communication from the SR staff about the situation, but there is likely a good reason for it. They need to watch their own asses, and the less they give away, the more difficult it is for authorities (or anyone else) to figure out anything about them, which is fine by me.<br /><br />Staying anonymous isn&#039;t easy.

				I think the idea of putting vendors at top priority in the current situation is to allow them to accept the orders that have already been made. SWIM has no idea if his orders have already been shipped, but he would rather they be shipped than be able to buy more/check on their status (of course, I know SWIM doesn&#039;t represent everyone here)

				And to everyone freaking out about the time ticking on autofinalizes or whatever else, it&#039;s pretty likely that they will adjust for that (add the down-time back in). If they don&#039;t, it&#039;s probably not the end of the world and it will at least be sorted out in the resolution center. I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll just let shit get completely finalized for customers that haven&#039;t received their items.

				I certainly hope the last 15 pages and countless other threads uselessly speculating on something no one here knows about nor can actually do anything to help/prevent/damage further is putting additional strain on SR.. Although I&#039;m pretty sure the site and the forums are not linked in any way in terms of hardware/DB.<br /><br />Since I already started this post though, I might as well add my 2cents in to the coin jar all the other &quot;IT&quot; experts have contributed to recently...<br /><br />Depending on how the SR database has been set up, it&#039;s possible that for every member of the site, there exist a record against every product listing and/or vendor. Yes this is extreme, but I have seen this first hand in commercial client-facing databases in an industry used by every one of us IRL. Perhaps there is only 1 record for the buyers per every favourited vendor and bookmarked listing. Of course maybe none of the above...<br /><br />My point is that NONE of us know exactly how the back end of this site works, what may have been set up initially to make it faster for us but is now doing the opposite, the technical hardware constraints, environmental factors (power stations at multiple locations around the world, that happen to be the homes of SR&#039;s multiple? servers, down simultaneously for example), or any other million things that can happen. Just because an event has a minuscule chance of occurring, doesn&#039;t mean it never will. Every person on this site, indeed the world currently, had a 1 in 7Billion chance of being born exactly the way they are etc, and yet that event occurred and continues to occur for others.

				Can we get some guarantee that resolutions that are due to autofinalise during the downtime will not be already autofinalised when it comes back up?<br /><br />I am FUCKED out of a couple of grand if that happens, it will be a fucking nightmare trying to reason with the vendor and SR admins

Although I&#039;m pretty sure the site and the forums are not linked in any way in terms of hardware/DB.<br /><br />Since I already started this post though, I might as well add my 2cents in to the coin jar all the other &quot;IT&quot; experts have contributed to recently...<br /><br />Depending on how the SR database has been set up, it&#039;s possible that for every member of the site, there exist a record against every product listing and/or vendor. Yes this is extreme, but I have seen this first hand in commercial client-facing databases in an industry used by every one of us IRL. Perhaps there is only 1 record for the buyers per every favourited vendor and bookmarked listing. Of course maybe none of the above...<br /><br />My point is that NONE of us know exactly how the back end of this site works, what may have been set up initially to make it faster for us but is now doing the opposite, the technical hardware constraints, environmental factors (power stations at multiple locations around the world, that happen to be the homes of SR&#039;s multiple? servers, down simultaneously for example), or any other million things that can happen. Just because an event has a minuscule chance of occurring, doesn&#039;t mean it never will. Every person on this site, indeed the world currently, had a 1 in 7Billion chance of being born exactly the way they are etc, and yet that event occurred and continues to occur for others.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I loved that last bit. :) if i can figure out how to +rep/+karma i will do so&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />---<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70572.msg580319#msg580319">Quote from: mtljohn on November 10, 2012, 11:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70572.msg580304#msg580304">Quote from: danknugsdun on November 10, 2012, 11:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70572.msg580294#msg580294">Quote from: mtljohn on November 10, 2012, 11:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">WTF.. this is bull shit...<br /><br />&quot;To quote DPR himself, &quot;We are in uncharted waters&quot;, and it appears that we have grown a little bit faster then we had anticipated.

				@liesistruth<br /><br />The thing is tho... 2 weeks ago we had this problem, DPR closed registrations and I assume did some cleaning and we were back up 12 hours later and even then some people were able to get on from time to time during the downtime... anyways.. whichever they did worked... now here we are 2 weeks later they re open the registrations and the same story only longer downtime...

				OK maybe some ideas.....<br /><br />DPR has an open access philosophy towards new users but this could allow underage kids who gained their BTC,s via game sites. Not much you can do about that but how about a membership fee of, say 1 bitcoin? That might put the oiks off.&nbsp; Now these bitcoiins go into a pot &amp; are used to:<br /><br />1. Expand the SR service - a backup/mirror would be great.<br />2. Refund buyers who have been ripped off by (proven) turnscam sellers. And vise-versa. <br /><br />It&#039;ll stop the chancers trying to get a 50/50/scam buyers making new account after new account etc.<br /><br />Why should vendors be the only ones paying? I think it&#039;ll bring a more sensible buyer to SR.

Suspending all registrations indefinitely is a short term fix. SR admins might as well take their time to solve the current issues and get the site functioning as per usual. Every business has its problems, SR was never going to run 100% smooth from start to finish, I dare say nothing does. If you have the funds to purchase 150 pounds of weed, then I&#039;m sure you will have the money to survive whilst SR is down.&nbsp; Furthermore, you previously stated that your IRL customer base is sufficient and that you don&#039;t even need to be on SR, you just do it for fun, so there shouldn&#039;t be any hurry. I&#039;ve been around longer than you have, and I don&#039;t feel I have anymore right to be here than someone who joined up today. Wait patiently like the rest of us and you&#039;ll be just fine.

				I am not sure what is causing the holdup and really do hope it is just an influx of new registrations, but it seems to me that would be an easy fix as SR was operating before the influx and could just expand the current programs and servers to keep the anonymity status quo.&nbsp; I do hope things return soon, but do admit a post from DPR would be great to shine a light on what has been occuring.&nbsp; Long Live the Road!

We all learn patients on this website and this is no different<br />. If a weekend or a week is required to keep this site safe and running then so be it.

I mean, everyone has some degree of trust in the SR or we wouldn&#039;t take the risks that we do here.

				Unless the database was terribly constructed, an influx of users will not cause this kind of outage. I&#039;d guess hardware failure before database error, unless it really was hacked.

				First of all I have to agree (limited) with Limitless. The man himself should have posted something as soon as we went down and simply said &quot;We are down. We will return in hours or days.&quot; But don&#039;t expect much more than a notice in the way of updates or communication. And do expect that this is more than a hardware outage. DPR polled everyone as to whether the changes she had made were working. The resounding answer was &quot;No!&quot;<br /><br />Most likely a new set of servers with better load balancing and separate databases are in order, hopefully along with a redundant system for compromise or failure. If that kind of build-out is taking place, DPR couldn&#039;t telegraph it because the activity in the physical world and the Internet routing world could tip off LE or at least give clues or leave traces to be followed.<br /><br />I think another slowdown occurred and DPR said enough is enough and pulled the plug to move over to a new setup that had been in the works for some time. Now when you undertake such a thing, coordinating the combination of facility, IP, hardware, software and data ain&#039;t no small thing. Add to that secrecy&#039;s need for minimization of hands on deck, uncharted territories of equipment and controls, and Murphy&#039;s Law (things WILL go wrong), and you have a VERY busy DPR who knows that once everything is back up and running, hopefully smoother than before, he will be a hero again and any rumblings of mutiny will be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />All I have to say to DPR and the mods, admins and other assorted angels is:&nbsp; Go get &#039;em tigers!<br /><br />&nbsp;(:<br /><br />Modzi

				Sometimes I wonder if DPR lets this type of thing happen once every few months just to laugh his ass off at the reaction. Seriously, the site is down for a few days and everyone immediately assumes the worst. The amount of work DPR has put into this site is outstanding. He has created a paradise, and it seems to me like most people here have no appreciation for that whatsoever. You&#039;re taking for granted this amazing thing that he created. And that pisses me off. You don&#039;t even realize that you&#039;re part of the new revolution. You&#039;re too busy crying about a week-long server issue. I mean Jesus fucking Christ people, you really think this is still a scam or hacker or whatever? You think DPR is done? If he was done, he wouldn&#039;t have made the fix to the initial problem that happened last week. Yes the site is down right now, but CALM THE FUCK DOWN. Realistically, vendors are the only people that honestly have a right to complain. They&#039;re the ones that stand to lose money here, and I totally understand their concerns. At the same time, you wouldn&#039;t have made all your money in the first place if DPR hadn&#039;t set this place up. After several years of running a fucking paradise, I think the guy deserves a little more trust and respect. Everyone is making drug users look like the whiny, needy addicts that the media paints us out to be. We don&#039;t have to be that. We can treat this unfortunate situation with some class and dignity, or we can go apeshit and run around screaming about the end of days. This is a drug site. Smoke a fucking bowl and RELAX.<br /><br />Thanks for the update admins. I know SR will be back at full speed any day now. In the meantime, I&#039;m remembering and honoring the amazing work that has been done here.

				First of all, thanks for the update, Inigo!&nbsp; Also, I have only 10 fingers and did not kill your father.&nbsp; Besides, the RSI in my right hand makes fencing rather painful after only a single bout.<br /><br />I was remiss to create an account on the forums here and to make a post, but I&#039;ve read every word that&#039;s been written in this thread and felt that I may be able add my own insight and to reiterate that which has already been answered.<br /><br />In general, I believe that forums frequently tend to bring out the worst in people--but also the best.&nbsp; All in all, the majority of the posts here have been very positive and gracious--which I really shouldn&#039;t be that surprised by, but I have seen far worse things posted about things that are far more inconsequential than this downtime.&nbsp; Though, there are some that have understandably strong feelings about these recent events.&nbsp; To those few, I would merely suggest that they go back and read Inigo&#039;s post again closely.<br /><br />We&#039;re all here because we have strong feelings about Silk Road.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just so that you can get your fix easily without having to deal with some of the most shady and unreliable people there are, because you truly believe in the ideology behind the site, or if you just find yourself somewhere in the middle.&nbsp; For myself, SR has been a godsend--I would have never imagined that something so amazing could exist and continue to subsist like this.&nbsp; I think the words from the good Dread Pirate Roberts were more prescient and insightful than anyone gave him or her credit for.<br /><br />&quot;We are in uncharted waters.&quot;<br /><br />You don&#039;t say!&nbsp; Never has there existed anything like Silk Road in the history of the Internet!&nbsp; These have always been uncharted waters, so forget about your background in administrating normal websites--as trafficked as they may be--and your idle and uninformed speculations.&nbsp; SR represents a technological, economic, legal, and sociological challenge unlike anything that has come before.&nbsp; So we can all stop pretending that we know anything about it or that any technical issues can be fixed with a few console commands.&nbsp; If they could have been, it would have been done already.<br /><br />Moreover, there&#039;s no need to demand an appearance from The Captain; Inigo already informed us that we would receive an appearance and statement within 48 hours.&nbsp; Which--by my count--is far from having come close to elapsed yet.<br /><br />And yes, I know that a lot of people are feeling anxious and/or need their fix.&nbsp; Personally, I have been dry for about three weeks.&nbsp; But the last time I was able load the website, I was able to see that my order was marked as shipped and all I have to do is wait until the next time my favorite letter-carrier stops by.&nbsp; Though, I sincerely sympathize with those who may not have been lucky to get their order in or to finish up whatever business they had on the site.&nbsp; But I also sincerely believe that no one has anything to worry about as far as the specifics of their transactions--be it worrying about auto-finalizing or receiving negative feedback because you were unable to fill your orders due to the outage.&nbsp; Inigo said that everything is okay, and that&#039;s enough for me.&nbsp; Worrying about a theoretical scenario for which you have no logical basis for believing in is just silly.&nbsp; And I&#039;m an expert on that at least!<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe that The Dread Pirate Roberts chose their monicker without thought.&nbsp; So instead of just waiting or causing uproar and unrest within the community, I would highly recommend that everyone just take a little time to watch &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.

				I&#039;m only a buyer, but I agree it&#039;s shitty to not update or notify the community beforehand, for vendors&#039; sake. Some vendors have so much money tied up in this system that SR being down for a few days is going to really hurt them. With timely information, they would have been able to better prepare.<br /><br />I love SR and I&#039;m very grateful for the experience. I&#039;d follow DPR off the edge of a cliff. Gonna stop bitching now, just had to give that 2 cents, cause I feel it&#039;s important. Vendors give a decent chunk of money to SR, they deserve to know (even in vague terms) what is going on and how it will affect their business.

				Pretty clear that SR has been compromised imo. The reference to &quot;our beloved dpr&quot; smacks of something a federal agent would write gloating about busting whoever was running the site when it was busted, and the post early in this thread from some noob about how the OP should alleviate everyone&#039;s concerns is an obvious attempt to get people to put down their guard and continue as if nothing has changed when the site comes back online, which it will, it&#039;ll just be run be the feds.

Seriously, the site is down for a few days and everyone immediately assumes the worst. The amount of work DPR has put into this site is outstanding. He has created a paradise, and it seems to me like most people here have no appreciation for that whatsoever. You&#039;re taking for granted this amazing thing that he created. And that pisses me off. You don&#039;t even realize that you&#039;re part of the new revolution. You&#039;re too busy crying about a week-long server issue. I mean Jesus fucking Christ people, you really think this is still a scam or hacker or whatever? You think DPR is done? If he was done, he wouldn&#039;t have made the fix to the initial problem that happened last week. Yes the site is down right now, but CALM THE FUCK DOWN. Realistically, vendors are the only people that honestly have a right to complain. They&#039;re the ones that stand to lose money here, and I totally understand their concerns. At the same time, you wouldn&#039;t have made all your money in the first place if DPR hadn&#039;t set this place up. After several years of running a fucking paradise, I think the guy deserves a little more trust and respect. Everyone is making drug users look like the whiny, needy addicts that the media paints us out to be. We don&#039;t have to be that. We can treat this unfortunate situation with some class and dignity, or we can go apeshit and run around screaming about the end of days. This is a drug site. Smoke a fucking bowl and RELAX.<br /><br />Thanks for the update admins. I know SR will be back at full speed any day now. In the meantime, I&#039;m remembering and honoring the amazing work that has been done here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Amen.

				Pretty sure DPR went on vacation on Friday, leaving the side under control of other admins.&nbsp; Site went down due to some technical reason (the symptoms don&#039;t seem consistent with too much load) and the admins couldn&#039;t fix it.&nbsp; DPR was off wanking it on the beach somewhere without his computer and other admins couldn&#039;t get in contact with him.&nbsp; He&#039;s probably due back today.&nbsp; I bet he doesn&#039;t even know the site is down until he gets back and logs on.&nbsp; Probably just needs to reset a server or something.

				I don&#039;t know if its of any relevance, but I&#039;m from midwest usa and I generally couldn&#039;t get on in the last month during the Netherlands peak hours anyway.. I buy that it&#039;s from users entirely I couldn&#039;t get on until like 10 pm anyway. Well if you&#039;re shook then I guess you&#039;re free to take your business elsewhere.. anyone buying for personal use has nothing to fear anyway.

				Just to be a bit negative... why would SR staff not send all coins to emergency wallets when the site goes down? Members, if you want to keep your hopes up, keep your hopes up but it&#039;s not looking good. The reason to say the site will be up soon is to buy time to sell the coins in DPR&#039;s possession without the BTC price dropping from a scare. Saying the site will be up soon gives DPR time to unload &quot;your&quot; coins without a large drop in btc worth while still giving time to do it in a secure/anonymous way... can&#039;t take one whole large sum to exchange... you have to do it piecemeal. The blockchain does not lie. Also, no message from DPR himself/herself keeps DPR&#039;s credentials intact for support of a new site blaming this on some kind of &quot;hack&quot; or &quot;system failure.&quot; <br /><br />DPR needs to give an explanation and release to funds to emergency wallets as a sign of being trustworthy. I don&#039;t know, just my most negative thoughts that seem to make a lot of sense at this moment. I still hold out some hope but each day that goes by without any answers or actions just confirms these fears, as well as the recent bitcoin activity.<br /><br />I hope I am wrong, I really do.

				no matter what the situation it is very difficult not to think the worst possibilities without any word from DPR, nothing suggested so far seems at all likely as a reason DPR would not take two minutes to post if there was a positive outcome in site. my sympathies to those with sizable amounts of BC tied up in this fiasco. and even if all turns up sunny and happy in ten minutes, i still maintain that in a situation like this a quick post from the man himself is the least we can expect.

By soon, I mean I would be shocked if we didn&#039;t have it back up by Monday.<br /><br />Please, I beg of you, don&#039;t start spreading any unnecessary rumors that will surely stir up chaos, fear, and confusion amongst out community.<br /><br />To quote DPR himself, &quot;We are in uncharted waters&quot;, and it appears that we have grown a little bit faster then we had anticipated. As a consequence, we are being plagued with all kinds of technical difficulties and poorly timed problems. <br /><br />Our beloved captain Roberts will be online and addressing you guys sometime in the next 48 hours to explain whats been going on and what has and is being done to fix it. Please be patient and rest assured that all will be well soon. <br /><br />Thank you for your understanding,<br />-Inigo<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Dealing with SR downtime - A Tutorial by Phlex<br />Efficiency = 100%<br /><br />1. Take a Xanax<br />2. Go OUTSIDE and get some Fresh Air<br />3. Get Laid<br />4. Use the drugs from your stash (remember where they came from?)<br />5. Make a list of what you&#039;ll buy when SR is back online<br />6. Gather some BTC for a binge when SR comes back online <br />7. Read the starting post of this topic (&quot;Silk Road has NOT been compromised&quot;)<br /><br />Not in any particular order.<br />Some steps may be negated or chosen for you liking.<br /><br />There is obviously a concern to speculate and fill in the gaps we do not know.

You are all in on the ground floor of a great experiment to mass market anonymous drugs on the internet. You can not expect or even reasonably hope for up-times equivalent to Amazon or Ebay. You would be crazy to. With the nature of this market, we are lucky that things have gone so smoothly. It is nothing short of a miracle that silk road runs as smooth as it does with as many people as it serves. Chill and wait it out. None of us are entitled to bitch

Although I&#039;m pretty sure the site and the forums are not linked in any way in terms of hardware/DB.<br /><br />Since I already started this post though, I might as well add my 2cents in to the coin jar all the other &quot;IT&quot; experts have contributed to recently...<br /><br />Depending on how the SR database has been set up, it&#039;s possible that for every member of the site, there exist a record against every product listing and/or vendor. Yes this is extreme, but I have seen this first hand in commercial client-facing databases in an industry used by every one of us IRL. Perhaps there is only 1 record for the buyers per every favourited vendor and bookmarked listing. Of course maybe none of the above...<br /><br />My point is that NONE of us know exactly how the back end of this site works, what may have been set up initially to make it faster for us but is now doing the opposite, the technical hardware constraints, environmental factors (power stations at multiple locations around the world, that happen to be the homes of SR&#039;s multiple? servers, down simultaneously for example), or any other million things that can happen. Just because an event has a minuscule chance of occurring, doesn&#039;t mean it never will. Every person on this site, indeed the world currently, had a 1 in 7Billion chance of being born exactly the way they are etc, and yet that event occurred and continues to occur for others.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hot damn. I don&#039;t post on these forums much but I definitely lurk extensively. However, this post is the post I&#039;ve been waiting for and thank you SO MUCH for bringing some sense into the swarm of retarded posts in this thread saying stuff like &quot;I could host this on my dial-up with a 285 processor&quot;. People are so ignorant to the fact that Silk Road isn&#039;t just a bunch of static pages. Every single page that every user looks at was generated dynamically JUST for them. Do people really think that index.php (the one link on the entire site) is the same file for everyone!? It&#039;s just dumb.<br /><br />Silk Road is custom written software. It&#039;s not just a static website. That software is obviously complex with probably many custom implementations like its handling of its escrow system, bitcoin transactions, integration with tor, and a host of other things that are unique to Silk Road. When a site grows so quickly, things you could have never anticipated start going wrong with a quickness. To add, I seriously doubt that SR has a squad of support staff to handle these issues and it&#039;s not like they can easily post online with their issues without a significant plan for cover.<br /><br />This ended up being much longer than the thank you I wanted to start with, but still, thanks for bringing some common sense into this.

				The levels of idiocy, mud slinging, bad vibes, ignorance and short sightedness on this thread are really quite astonishing! <br /><br />DPR, whoever he she or they maybe, sets up a pretty fucking slick, untraceable, easy to use and totally accountable open market place from which subversives, misfits, rebels, losers, loners and freaks like ourselves can finally buy and sell illegal drugs in a monitored, friendly and reasonably trustworthy environment for the first time in our dull as fuck restricted bullshit fucking micro existences - despite the oppressive laws for narcotics remaining exactly the same as they always have been around the world. And what happens? At the first blip of technical teething problems caused in part due to the success and huge levels of traffic on the site a collection of users are now biting the very hand that has been feeding them all this time to bandy about unfounded conspiracy theories and paranoid bullshit without a shred of compelling evidence to support these spurious claims.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seriously folks, cut DPR and the admin some slack! Try to be patient and intelligent before you get your mouth on about some fucking illuminati lizard people conspiracy mass theft bullshit!&nbsp; :P&nbsp; Familiarity breeds contempt so perhaps we all need to remember back to as little as two years ago when the majority of us were still having to buy our drugs of choice mouth-to-fucking-mouth off unreliable criminals in housing estate stairwells who were all about the Benjamins and couldn&#039;t give a fuck what they were selling and who they were selling to. <br /><br />Seriously. Remember those days? <br /><br />Brrrrrr. Not cool.<br /><br />We are living at the dawn of a truly global narcotics market which, through example and harmony by us the early settlers of this drug market virtual new world, will hopefully trigger the immovable moral monoliths of government to seriously consider the legislation of all drugs for both social and economic reasons. We have to lead by example as we are the founding fathers of this virtual arcadia of patience and enlightenment!&nbsp; So let&#039;s quit with all the finger pointing and have faith that as soon as sometime next week we will all be back on the road and collectively traveling towards a better society. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Oh and if we&#039;re still debating why SR is still down in about two weeks time - then, yeah, we need to regroup and collectively consider where to go next because I for one am never NEVER going back to the housing estate stairwells to score my substances of paranoid criminals and kids. Strength in numbers. We need to remain united and move as one mass of unstoppable energy! SR forever baby! etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;:D ;)

				I&#039;ve been frustrated through all of this. I would love to be able to get on the road and make the purchases I want to make or at least to hear more about what is going wrong. These things are not happening. That&#039;s okay shit happens and I&#039;m taking a deep breath and just relaxing through it all, because whatever will be will be. We don&#039;t really know what the situation is with DPR and the others. For all we know DPR was in a serious accident and the rest of the SR team are trying to piece things together. Maybe DPR is sitting in a hospital somewhere holding that hand of a dying loved one and something went wrong with the system and everyone is trying to correct it, while giving him the space he needs to grieve. Maybe he&#039;s on vacation. Maybe he&#039;s in jail. We don&#039;t know, but I think we should all try and keep some perspective that one of those circumstances, or any number of other circumstances, could be happening that affect this situation. <br /><br />Even though I am new, I love SR. I think it is a brilliant idea and it seems like there is a great community here. I know most everyone else also feels attached to SR. In this thread I&#039;ve seen a lot of people bickering, predicting the end of times, and putting up numerous conspiracy theories, while others tell everyone to just relax and take a deep breath. What I&#039;m wondering is what can we, the SR community-vendors &amp; buyers, do to help? Is there anything that the admins or mods need from us that would help alleviate this problem?<br /><br />Just my two cents.<br /><br />PS. Just got to a page saying the SR is down for maintenance. So things are getting better.

				The original admin post in this thread said DPR would make an official statement in 48 hours or so.&nbsp; Its been just over 24 hours.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t freak out yet, there&#039;s been system outages before without any statement from DPR, and the site comes back.<br /><br />As far as the theory of bitcoins being sold off being a sign that DPR is making a run for it....it&#039;s probably more likely that some users here have large amounts of BTC purchased to use for purchases here....and are selling them off to be cautious in case the site doesn&#039;t come back, and the value goes down.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nothing to do but hope for the best, and keeping waiting another 24 hours for an official statement.

				Just throwing this out there for you to make of it what you will. Prior to knowing about the current situation I loaded 150 BTC into my account already containing 40 BTC, which has been confirmed received through the block chain. So, what I can personally deduce from this, is that the SR wallet is still functioning, the forums are still functioning, so therefore the site is under some sort of upgrade. I just find it odd that the BTC network can get to our accounts but we can&#039;t. I stand to lose about 2K if shit hits the fan, but I have faith in my ships captain, and you should to.

As I posted before (and a few others mentioned), if the SR team was making off with our BC, the forums wouldn&#039;t still be here. Further, if that HAD been the case, what can bitching here about it really do?<br /><br />What are your other options? Report it to the police? lol<br />Sit back. Relax. Have a drink/smoke/whatever.

				If the site was programmed to send coins to emergency wallets whenever it went down, then the block chain would indicate which addresses were affiliated with SR. Huge security risk. If you want to have a more sound mind when things like this happen, read up on the cryptography behind bitcoin. In fact, do it regardless - it will help you stay safer online.<br /><br />Bitcoin is a trustless cryptoscheme - you send BTC to addresses without being able to verify to whom you are sending it and without being able to revoke transactions. You can only bank on the security you place on your own wallet. There is no web of trust. If you don&#039;t want your BTC in other people&#039;s hands, leave your BTC in your own wallets and only transfer it to the site when you need to place an order. I have like 0.10 BTC in my SR wallet right now, thank goodness. (I understand that some of you may have sent BTC over right before the outage, and my heart goes out to you.)<br /><br />I hope what I&#039;m saying helps you all feel a little more secure/prepared/educated. Please relax. This has happened a lot before!

You can send to a wallet in cold storage (as previously mentioned) and it&#039;ll get confirmed. There is no way to know if the address that received the coins is &quot;connected&quot; as you put it. It isn&#039;t like it sends out a message to the network saying &quot;Oh yeah, I see you sent me those coins.&quot; It just downloads the blockchain and will eventually see &quot;This public address/key attached to my wallet/private key had coins sent there.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yep, this is how it works.

				Hey guys, let&#039;s try something. Before posting, look at your karma. If you have something like +1/-15 or +0/-9 etc, refrain from posting in this thread! :) <br /><br />Also, just as a note: if you try to go to http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/, you get the &quot;The Silk Road is down for maintenance. We will get the site back up asap. Thank you for your patience.&quot;. If you go to index.php, you get a 404. I noticed someone said they got the 404, so I figured I could help.

				It&#039;s good to finally receive an &#039;official&#039; update regarding the matter rather than just people speculating over a situation that nobody can neither prove nor disprove. I am in no hurry to access SR other than for the fact I would like to release funds to a couple of sellers I have had successful transactions with.<br /><br />My only question would be whether our funds in escrow which are due to auto-finalise will still auto finalise at the appropriate date or whether they will be postponed until we have SR back up.
