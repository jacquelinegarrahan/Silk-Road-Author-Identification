				Wanted to introduce myself. Can&#039;t believe that this site exists! I&#039;m basically looking to get safe products at around the half oz mark (depending on the product) plus some smaller, specialty orders :p. This site is amazing and living proof that prohibition is a waste of time and money, not to mention the negative effects it has on harm reduction, which is the only workable policy I can see for drugs.<br /><br />Anyway, my main question is regarding buying sizes. If someone is selling say, 100g of whatever, is it possible to buy half of it or&nbsp; smaller portion of it? Or are you just paying for what&#039;s posted? Could you do personal deals with a seller? Hope this makes sense, I only registered on the site yesterday so still learning the ropes.

				If you message a vendor they might be willing but I wouldn&#039;t ask for custom orders first time. Also start out small... You may well be asked to FE at first, everyone advises not to but it&#039;s difficult at first. Just choose a respected established vendor and make a 2-3 BTC order that you can afford to lose. Itll prob babe fine but I wouldn&#039;t recommend spending £80 or whatever on first go.<br />The BTC exchange rate can be found at Intersango. If you want to buy BTC totally anonymously tho, a user called Vlad1m1r offers a cash in mail service in UK. He is totally reliable many of us use him, you get then in a few days for 12% I think. It&#039;s currently about £7.50-1BTC.

				Okay, thanks. I know that the Armory is closed but is there any other way to deal in firearms securely online?
