				Hi fellow SR members...............To say i&#039;m confused is an understatement as I am about to make my first purchase on SR.<br />Common sense tells me to use the escrow system ?&nbsp; Yet it seems that most newbies are asked to finalise early and I can also understand why a seller would want you to, But we all have to start somewhere !!<br />Some SR members quote &quot;Don&#039;t buy from anyone with less than 500 sales...Don&#039;t finalise early&quot; &amp; Yet nearly all the feedback that I&#039;ve read says Finalised early to show support or Finalised early new buyer ???<br /><br />What shall I do ?? any feedback would be very much appreciated <br />Regards Sickofbash

				It&#039;s not just noobs, I&#039;ve been using silkroad for over a year now, sellers can see my buyer stats, never had to go to resolution but yet, if I am ordering off someone I have not dealt with before I have to finalise early and it&#039;s really fucking me off. Especially since my order of last week has not turned up, seller appears to be in stealth and I only just learned about stealth so I can&#039;t check their profile (warweeds&#039; bot page doesn&#039;t load for me) to see when they logged in last cos I did not become a fan when I ordered and they have not answered my message.<br /><br />I would tell you to have a good look at their feedback but you can only see the last 20 feedbacks now, I can only suggest what others have and have a good search of the forums for info on the seller, try buy a small purchase first so if you do get stung you&#039;re not loosing loads.<br /><br />If this finalise early shit continues I might have to drop back to trying to source locally which will suck ass.

				Don&#039;t finalize early!&nbsp; And if you absolutely refuse to take this advice, then when you do, leave the comments blank.&nbsp; You do not have to make a comment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t give good feedback until you get the product and try it out.&nbsp; Then log back in and leave your feed back.&nbsp; Just because you finalize early doesn&#039;t mean you have to leave feedback. <br /><br />There are Vendors out there that will not require you to finalize early.&nbsp; Buy from them until you build up a good rep.

But it is really a mistake to finalize early. It&#039;s not only risky to you personally, but caving in and finalizing early just because a given vendor asks you to legitimizes the practice and makes it all the more likely that more and more vendors will begin insisting on it.<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of institutional memory on these forums and a fair number of decent folks who&#039;ll take a bit of time to give you advice/recommendations if you ask. Good luck.

				all good advice in here so far.&nbsp; I never have finalized early and do not plan to at any point.&nbsp; Like others have said, there are a lot of reputable vendors who will never ask for buyers to finalize early, regardless of their purchasing stats.&nbsp; Just keep an eye out for these vendors, and once you&#039;ve got a few purchases under your belt, then you can move on to other vendors if you so choose.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid to PM the seller either.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good way to introduce yourself and state your intentions and to ask specific questions as to how the vendor operates and if they&#039;d be a good fit for what you want; kind of like a cover letter almost!<br /><br />Utilize the forums too.&nbsp; If you&#039;re active, people can get an idea of the kind of person you are and what you&#039;re about.&nbsp; Granted, a scammer could also utilize the forums or send sincere PM&#039;s only to screw a vendor/buyer over, but hey, you got to make due with what you have.<br /><br />Lastly, be patient.&nbsp; It takes some time to figure out exactly how Silk Road works.&nbsp; Once most people figure it out, they&#039;re anxious to make a purchase.&nbsp; I think there are two phases to getting accustomed to this site: Figuring out how it works, and then finding a buyer whose business model fits your needs.&nbsp; Many new users get screwed because they&#039;re very impatient.&nbsp; Take your time and do your homework!! Don&#039;t finalize early either!

As boringflooring points out, it will only create more Vendors requiring early finalization with the possibility of it becoming the norm.&nbsp; This would be a magnet for scammers. <br /><br />It should only be ok to finalize early if it&#039;s voluntary and the seller wants to help out his Vendor (maybe in the hopes of getting a little extra next time).&nbsp; The Vendor could explain on his page the problem with cash flow when working with Bitcoins and any early finalization would be appreciated with a little gratuity added in the shipment.&nbsp; <br /><br />But generally speaking, I think early finalization is an extremely bad practice.&nbsp;

				Make smaller purchases to begin with.&nbsp; I can understand a vendor not wanting to send 2 oz of weed to a first time buyer.&nbsp; A small order is best for you too.&nbsp; It lets you inspect the stealth of the vendor to determine if you want to order again.<br />The first time I ordered weed (NOT through SR) it arrived in a us mailer.&nbsp; Inside was a clear baggie with the weed in it.&nbsp; Not only was it not vacume sealed but if the package had ripped the weed was clearly visible.<br /><br />My advice is to start with some smaller orders and you will quicklly build a reputation as a reputable buyer<br /><br />

				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^+1<br /><br />I never finalized early even on my first couple of orders but as said above I always bought about the smallest amount they sold just to test the waters. And that works both ways as sellers are less nervous about selling to newbies if the order is small where the risk is minimal for both parties.

				Thanks for all the great advice fellow SR members and the product I was referring to was H, But in the end I decided to use my common sense and to bite the bullet buy starting with a small order, If things went tits up then so be it.<br />Things are so bad in the UK regarding H and when you have dealers saying that what they have is of good quality but consequently fuck you over after you&#039;ve paid your hard earned cash then the risk involved is about the same.<br />The reasons given by said sellers were Newbies must Finalise early &quot;To Many Dishonest People out there&quot; and tbh I can see the point of both sides as quoted by Locrian &amp; WaterTiger,,,But it was the Escrow system that gave me some confidence despite my close mates saying &quot; Forget it you&#039;ll be Scammed &quot; Well I&#039;m pleased to say that so far I haven&#039;t because there are some decent people left in this Shity world.<br /><br />IMHO..

				I am a vendor now for more than 5 month with 100% satisfied customer with more than 80 transactions and even more than 100 shipments. <br />To me new customers have to finalize early.<br />Because of this decision I have NO DOUBT that scammers&nbsp; have been mostly stayed away.<br />I am honest, trustable, reliable and fast and there is no reason why I should not been paid when I ship the order!<br />In Germany it is the only way to buy something on the internet. You always have to pay forwarding your shipment.<br />I do not understand the problems some people seems to have with it.<br /><br />The buyer has to take some risk, too. I am not responsible for seizures from your customs or the postman who takes your order for himself.<br />I have to pay for stamps, envelopes, printing labels, items and so on. <br />I spent the whole day by answering to sometimes ridiculous questions and annoying people.<br /><br />If you are a new customer it is no problem for you to get into business but you have to finalize your order.<br /><br />I am very successful by doing so and as I consider no problems by this way of payment I will keep on doing so!<br /><br />By the way:<br />I absolutely have no comprehension for people which place their order and refuse to finalize then.<br />If you are ordering you agree to all terms. No doubt about that.<br /><br />So if you do not agree to finalize early as a new customer or a returning customer outside germany than pleace do not place your order.<br /><br />Hope I can get some LIGHT into this discussion and this helps you to understand both sides.<br /><br />Greets JD

				A vendor may be the nicest most stand up person ever but they can still get busted. Just because you send out packages on time doesn&#039;t mean that you won&#039;t screw (and I use that for a lack of a better term because it&#039;s not intentional) however many people you have yet to ship to if you get taken down. This can happen at any given time and all those people are out money because they finalized early. <br /><br />@dank, I hope you have some decent prices because DMT on here now is either non-existant, only sold in quantities way too much for me, or a stupid high price.
