				SMH. I just spent the last week and a half preparing myself (getting supplies, deleting EFIX data from pictures, learning about packaging, Bitcoins &amp; GPG) in order to become a coca vendor on SR and as soon as I had the $150 deposited into my account to open a seller account, this message pops up:<br /><br />&quot;Seller registration is closed at the moment. Please check back in a few days.&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;m offering a free 0.5 gram sample to the first 4 &quot;power&quot; users, i.e. someone that has more than 20+ successful transactions as a buyer and is pretty active on the forums so they can review my product. However, that&#039;ll have to wait until this problem is resolved.<br /><br />What do you guys think I should do with the Bitcoins? Should I keep it in SR, thereby risking the price of Bitcoins to drop, or should I convert it back to USD? <br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help. <br />&nbsp;<br />

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;re at too much risk of the btc price dropping significantly, but you&#039;ll have to ask others.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t store btc on SR so if it goes down (as it often does) you still have access to your coins.

				I&#039;m in the same boat as you. I have a bunch of people expecting samples but what am i supposed to do? Send out samples for free when i can&#039;t even get a sellers account now? I&#039;ve also spent a lot of time preparing for this, and am going to bring a lot of different products to the table but the whole point in offering samples was to build up a reputation as a seller. Now it would just be sending out free stuff for no reason.<br /><br />Can a mod or SR chime in and let us know what&#039;s going on?

				I think your BTC value should be safe (or go up a bit) at least until the 15th. The Jan 15th episode of &#039;The Good Wife&#039; is going to be about (fictional) Bitcoin creator being hauled up in court. This kind of run up in value happens every time a &#039;media event&#039; in approaching.<br /><br />In the week after it&#039;s either going to go way up or way down. The general pattern is that it will tank, but only time will tell.<br />

				Zillagod, that is nuts that they&#039;re making a show about Bitcoins on a major TV network. I might have to watch &quot;The Good Wife&quot; for the first time!<br /><br />Does anyone know why SR would disable new Seller registration?

				I can make a listing for you what you purchase (its hedged) and when you want your coins back I refund you let say 95%.<br />That is just an idea and maybe is too expensive with SR fee.

				If SR ever closes seller registration for good or for a prolonged period of time it is a huge flag to jump ship because if LE ever take over SR they may do the same thing to try to tilt the vendor/fed ratio to their favor. I don&#039;t say SR did this but just keep it in mind.

				in the past i have been burnt holding onto bitcoins, so now i never hold them unless i intend to spend them immediately. learned the hard way.&nbsp; however prices do seem to be on the rise, so you may potentially make a profit by holding on to them.&nbsp; you can go ahead and call me &quot;captain obvious&quot; now.
