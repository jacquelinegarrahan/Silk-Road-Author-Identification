				Vendors can peg their prices to the US dollar which will automatically adjust the BTC amount. It&#039;s at the Vendors discretion whether they peg the price or not.

				I was wondering this myself, and it does appear most vendors automatically have their BTC prices adjusted based on the exchange rate.&nbsp; The question is which exchange rate do they use, I thought different bitcoin exchangers had slightly different exchange rates or methods for determining exactly what exchange rate they offer?&nbsp; And do they use the most recent value of the exchange rate, an average over some time interval, or what?

And right now a Btc is worth $10 bucks.... then the bag cost 1 Btc. Well if the Btc go&#039;s to being worth $20 do we still ask 1 Btc that is now worth $20 so we are selling the same bag for $20 instead of $10...or do we sell for .5 Btc making it still $10?<br /><br />This example should make it clear to everyone... 99.999% of us base our prices on the dollar not the Btc.. So it makes no difference what the Btc is..You will always pay the same. Yes you can find one vendor that just charges 5 Btc regardless of the value of it..But that vendor is usually a moron and just does not understand the Btc.<br /><br />But all of the solid vendors price our items in dollars..So you never have to worry.<br /><br />Silk Road takes a 24 hour waited average from Mt.Gox for the value of a Btc. I would suggest you selling Btc charge SR value not the Mt.Gox price. Your customers will be happier and it will be a lot faster and easier for you to get the Btc to your customer as you can just send it to them from your SR account to theirs. That way you are not having to wait for any confirmations. On top of that your exchange rate will be a lot easier and clear to your customer.<br /><br />To get that price at the time of your &quot;deal&quot; just put an item into your cart and you will get SR current value for Btc..Then go from there.<br /><br />Good luck

It&#039;s not a dollar, euro, pound, or any other national currency. It&#039;s like a bar of gold. If you go check the value of gold, you&#039;ll see it&#039;s worth 1764 USD. Tomorrow it might drop and be worth 1760 USD. It might increase in value and hit 1770. We don&#039;t know. Right now, the Bitcoin&#039;s worth is 11.77 USD.<br /><br />Vendors usually set their prices to change based on the Bitcoin&#039;s worth, so they don&#039;t have to check every hour, delist the item, and relist it. So if they want something to sell for 100 USD, they would set it at 8.4 BTC, because 8.4 BTC * 11.77 USD/BTC is 100 USD. If the price of BTC goes down tomorrow to 10 USD/BTC, then their listing would change to say that 10 BTC are required instead of 8.4, because 10 BTC * 10 USD/BTC is 100 USD. <br /><br />The BTC in your account will never change, but their values will. And if their value goes up, they&#039;re worth more and you can use them to buy more things. If their value drops, you&#039;ll need more to buy the same things. Think of it like gold.<br /><br />Just be glad the BTC has been fairly constant. Outside of a strange recent 2-ish day fluctuation where it dropped to nearly 10, it&#039;s been on a very slow but steady climb in value for a while now.

				So when a vendor sets up their account they have the option of having prices automatically adjust based on the Mt Gox weighted average, thanks for clearing that up RX&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; Vendors can choose to have their prices as fixed BTC prices also (don&#039;t know why anyone would do this), can vendors also choose to pin their prices to other exchange rates, like the most recent instant Mt Gox rate?
