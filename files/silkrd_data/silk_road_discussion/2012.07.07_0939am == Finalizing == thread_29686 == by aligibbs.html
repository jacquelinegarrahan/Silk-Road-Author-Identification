				So, I haven&#039;t placed an order in a couple of weeks. I placed one yesterday, it arrived today but there seems to be a 2 day wait on the finalize button. Is this a new feature that&#039;s been implemented? (Not sure how I&#039;ve missed an announcement on this if it is! Oops!).<br /><br />Anyone know of a way to get around it? I&#039;ve messaged the vendor but it feels pretty shitty that he can&#039;t get his money when I&#039;ve got my product. <br /><br />Cheers guys!

				This feature was implemented to prevent new vendors from having people finalize early. The only way around it is to wait til the vendor has more than 35 orders. Too many new vendor were popping up and asking their &quot;customers&quot; to Finalize early&nbsp; and then running off with the money. I think it was a good idea, even if it has that protect people from themselves feel.

Admittedly this would be rather dishonest! I&#039;ve never known which camp to fall into when it comes to this kind of thing as there seems to be a huge conflict of interest between buyers not wanting to pay good money for non existent products and sellers not wanting to sell quality products only for their payment to be snatched away by malicious buyers who claim they didn&#039;t receive it...<br /><br />V.

				Ahh, thanks guys! Yes, I had read about that. Doh! I&#039;ve never ordered from a vendor that wasn&#039;t established before and don&#039;t usually go out of Escrow anyway which is why I like to finalize as soon as I get it (I think the system works if we work it correctly!).<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit conflicted about the new vendor rule though. I understand the reasoning for it from the buyer&#039;s POV but on the flip side the vendor I ordered from is presumably waiting to get his x-amount of purchases etc. that he needs so people can release funds when they receive their package. It&#039;d be easier for him to get more purchases if people could at least post feedback (i.e. I&#039;ve got this guys product now and will be using it from the moment I&#039;m done with work for the 2 days until I can give him his money so can easily post some feedback for other buyers to see so they can decide whether to use him and thus increase his business flow, etc!) Oh well, food for thought - maybe a feature request in the future?<br /><br />God, now I&#039;m just going on! Thanks again!<br /><br />
