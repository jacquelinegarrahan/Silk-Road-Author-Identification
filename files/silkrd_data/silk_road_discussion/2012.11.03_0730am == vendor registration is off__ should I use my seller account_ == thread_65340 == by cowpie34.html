				That is a good question, i now understand your issue - thank you for clarifying<br /><br />First i would try closing out of the tor browser and re-opening it to see if the link to register a new acct reappears on the login page if youve been on since the connection problems were occurring (unless you just opened it since SR came back online)<br /><br />I am not sure if new member registration was closed due to the connectivity issues actually. If they were you might consider waiting a couple days and they might reappear once the issue has been completely solved. Or you could possibly message SR support and ask about this problem because if they closed registration for new members they may have a special way to allow people to still open new vendor accts potentially<br /><br />just keep in mind support has been behind on messages and may take a few days to get back to you so please be patient

				its best to keep your buying acct separate from you vending acct<br /><br />i recommend you just wait until you can register a new acct and then become a vendor

				i have no clue, i dont think they will delete the account,&nbsp; they suggest that because it is not safe <br /><br />just suggesting you consider waiting for your own security<br /><br />i dont know anyone who sold from their buyer acct so who could answer your question. dont see why it would delete your acct or buyer stats just because you can vend though too <br /><br />you might want to contact sr support and ask them about it for sure

Some of use want to cash out and we use BTC vendors and not our real account names for very obvious reasons..... Every transaction is a new account never to be used again.....
