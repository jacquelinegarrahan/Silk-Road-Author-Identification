				I think theres a link at the bottom of the page like &quot;become a vendor&quot; then you have to agree to something and then you gotta pay SR, dont know how much though, anyone know?<br /><br />u cash out by using btc-&gt;cash/gold if you want to be anon, otherwise funnel it into your bank account and tell the feds u got it from btc speculation (and pay capital gains tax on it).

				You can deposit BTC into a bitfloor account, use it to buy USD, and withdraw into a checking account.&nbsp; You lose anonymity when you do that, obviously.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If we&#039;re talking many thousands of dollars, I&#039;d go through a vendor and buy anonymous VCCs.&nbsp; Usually, they can be loaded with up to around $4k US, and a good vendor can get you as many as you want.&nbsp; For a fee, he can pre-load them.&nbsp; That&#039;s untraceable, and very spendable.

Use a few btc exhanges(don&#039;t cash out all through one, that&#039;s retarded), sell coins to people locally through websites that help you find interested buyers using something like localbitcoins.com, or find methods of getting cash with btc prepaid credit cards, or moneypaks. You can even exchange it for other online currencies and cash out through those. It&#039;s money/stock man, just barter.

This is literally digital money laundering, the whole goal is obfuscation. If it looks like it&#039;s coming from multiple places you have deniability

				Buy gold with BTCs, sell the gold for cash.<br /><br />Use a local exchange such as localbitcoins<br /><br />Nobdy here is going to give up there exact method for cashing out, Each vendor uses a slightly different method.<br /><br /><br />Start selling and making some coins, then worry about this. <br />
