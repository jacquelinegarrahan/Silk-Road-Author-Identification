				Hi! <br />I want to create a new thread that records busts on Vendors. There are a lot of substantiated rumors going around that vendors are getting busted / that the site is compromised. <br />I would really like to be able to keep an eye on weather the number of busts is increasing. After all it is our freedom at stake. <br /><br />Please comment with the name of the vendor and any evidence you have to point to the conclusion. <br /><br />I remember a thread not long ago with a Vendor being busted, he got his mate to comment in his vendor account that it had happened. <br /><br />Everyone please chip in, it will be a really useful thread to put peoples minds at ease and as an early warning system if the site is compromised. <br /><br />ACE

				Instead of just talking about people that wernt good at thier jobs or for whatever other reason got busted I think the focus should be on ways to prevent a similar fate. I know people get arrested each day, I dont need the details Ive heard alot of stories. What I care about is how to keep my ass out of trouble.

The report spoke of SR down time for over 2 weeks and we were all speaking of possible LE breach then on to hackers etc..

				Why the hell would they be giving their address in phone # for something that is Electronic? I understand if there going to buy coins from bitinstant or whatever but what a bunch of MORONS.. Damn well i&#039;ll admitt iv used a Vendor for Xanax bars that has been here over 3 months and still has no pgp, but i highly doubt i will use him again until he does.. Iv msg him telling him i will make him to most easy dummmies guide to PGP someone can get, and i dont get a reply so i guess thats his way of saying &#039;fuck off&#039; &#039; .. Encryption is not hard AT ALL and should be a must..Well at least for buyers, I understand a Vendor will not say &#039;HEY U DID NOT ENCRYPT!!! NO DRUGS!!&quot; cause i dont really think a seller not encrypting will hurt a vendor, Could it? Whats a Vendors POV on PGP? Im curious.. Btw im not trying to change the subject of this thread, but i saw where one person said they wanted to know how to keep their ass out of jail, and the last few posts are 1 good way..

				There was a member of the forums I was in the process of negotiating bulk orders of weed with and about a month ago he dropped off the face of the earth. I did some research on him and he was all over the forums making deals left and right for all sorts of drugs, not just bud. Not sure if he got busted so I&#039;m not gonna put the username out there and start a rumor if it&#039;s not true.. but ultimately everyone should be very careful. Unfortunately a lot of the younger generation has gotten so comfortable with social networking/the internet that they don&#039;t associate danger with technology as much as they should. Just because this website functions like a regular e-commerce website does not make it safe!&nbsp;

				Well if a Vendor or buyer give up their password to decrypt the msgs.. But Once u Encrypt something and put it into SR once done it gone for good, unless the vendor is keping the info there should be nothing to get.. If i was a vendor, i would take in the orders as they came and write down the name and address on the shipping pack and nothing else, U have to have a password and Keys to decrypt msgs..

If anything, and trust me on this, it makes it less safe. Because it is a false sense of security, buyers will put their plain-text addresses in knowing it will arrive to the vendor encrypted... after going to the server in plaintext. Yeah, they can keep logs of that REALLY easily.<br /><br />And now... I still think BMR is most likely a honeypot from the Feds.

				I&#039;m a new tor user. I&#039;ve dabbled with Tor for the last year and just recently I&#039;ve installed tails onto a flash drive and I&#039;m really looking through Tor sites like the silk road. So far the most useful websites I&#039;ve found are torgle and onionbookmark, these were relatively easy to find, I used the packaged &quot;start page&quot; search to find torgle and torgle to find onionbookmark, then I simply clicked on the biggest link &quot;forums&quot; and the first result was this site.<br /><br />This is great for getting new members to find out about Tor sites, but it also means anyone can find these sites. I believe that because I found this site so easy, anyone trying to track vendors would also find it easy to get to this site and everything you post here is being read by the fbi or whoever is trying to find these vendors.<br /><br />I feel like everyone here has already thought of this so my question is, how do you deal with this? If all your information on this site is monitored how do you expect to continue to operate and how do you expect these threads to help you if the people you&#039;re planning against can read it?<br /><br />I understand that this information may be confidential and I don&#039;t expect a response if you can&#039;t, I&#039;m simply curious.

I&#039;d love it if more were encrypted for their own safety but I simply don&#039;t have the time to educate people, I&#039;ve aided a couple whom have sent wrongly encrypted PGP info and that was hard enough - at the end of the day it&#039;s their risk and we as vendors can only look to minimise our own and in the same breath I could never afford to say &quot;no PGP no product&quot; as the economics don&#039;t work for that. <br /><br />As for vendors being busted - I dare say many do but I&#039;d also say many of those busts will have nothing to do with their online activities, after all vendors oft sell offline and they often buy their product in bulk offline and maybe involved in all other kinds of activities that may lead to them being busted. A lot of the time I&#039;d hedge that LE only find out they were on SR after a bust for something else.

				Public arrest records show that with exception to a large bust on April 17th 2012 of what the Feds called a LSD ring, they are currently averaging one arrest per month from the site in general. I found this information on Google through the clear-net. I am very cautious about diving into this community, so I have been following that fairly closely. So far this community seems to be safe when used properly. Reports on the arrest show that they are made do to careless mistakes. There is some controversy regarding the safety of TOR, but I have friends on Wall Street that are very proficient in computers / hacking and they claim that TOR is practically iron clad when used in combination with encryption and common sense safety measures. This is only there opinion of course, but the statistics on arrests were pulled from the internet like I said. Senator Joe Manchin is doing everything he can to stop it.

My memory isn&#039;t eidetic so I don&#039;t remember everything said but the impression I got is that he thinks making child-porn is wrong but that owning, &quot;using&quot;, or seeking child porn is not wrong.<br /><br />My personal feelings are based on the fact that the production of child porn largely requires a child to be raped. Thus, the images/videos are a record of that rape and anyone who seeks such content is, more or less, in support of children getting raped(in that they consume the media of such an event).<br /><br />So it is a difference in opinion that makes me view him in a negative light. Oh, also the fact that he posted a thread asking why people don&#039;t send mail-bombs to LE, and then went on to encourage the practice of trying to mailbomb LE.<br /><br />But no, I&#039;m sure he might understand tor quite well... Given his apparent character however, I&#039;m not interested in that knowledge.

				We all have to remember that the ones are open to being busted are the ones RECEIVING...there are only a couple ways for a vendor to get busted and its just more easier to bust the people grabbing the product then sending the product. But precautions have to be made by both.&nbsp; &nbsp;

But I believe the safety of the silk road in relation to the amount of arrest has stayed pretty stable. Proper Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance.

				SR automatically encrypts information in the checkout section an everywhere else I&#039;m reasonably sure. You only have to worry if the site or your vendor is compromised which as we have seen recently is possible. <br /><br />Anyone talking about &quot;exit nodes getting tapped&quot; have no idea about how TOR works though.<br /><br /><br />There is an excellent video on YouTube by two of the TOR team called How The Governments Have Tried To Stop TOR which explains how the system works. Even if they got part of the message that is all they would get, maybe a few disjointed letters and numbers. Think Nazi German Enigma machine on future tech steroids and you have TOR&#039;s system.<br /><br />Use PGP for the safety if you know how, but anyone ordering a few grams here and there ought not to worry too much, especially if it isn&#039;t even their address but a random drop site.<br /><br />Even Hotmail is encrypted FFS so do yourself that favor peeps and use tools that are available. <br /><br />You might not need safety glasses %99.9 of the time, but it will be the only time you don&#039;t need when you chip the blade and it lands in your eye blinding you.

				Actually yeah, the safest way to secure the SR server would be to colocate and supply your own hardware rather than renting a dedicated server. Install the OS at home, set up ssh access, then rig the chassis so if it&#039;s opened or tampered, it triggers an emergency shut down procedure that scrambles RAM. Then ship that to the data center.

				In practice, modern DDR-based RAM does not retain a useable amount of stable data longer than a minute or so. Gluing in the RAM sticks, disabling the unlock safety switch after installing, etc will likely delay LE long enough to make cold boot useless, assuming you shut the computer down as soon as they&#039;re at the door.<br /><br />Most of the time they don&#039;t even remove the RAM, they try to boot from a removable device instead. Setting a BIOS password and enabling the full POST will take care of that. Make sure you enable any startup logo that obscures the boot process, that way they won&#039;t see the RAM being cleared.<br /><br />EDIT: None of these security measures are worth a damn if you tell people about them. Once LE finds out about your setup (they will if you talk about it), you&#039;re fucked because they&#039;ll simply come prepared.

I understand if there going to buy coins from bitinstant or whatever but what a bunch of MORONS.. Damn well i&#039;ll admitt iv used a Vendor for Xanax bars that has been here over 3 months and still has no pgp, but i highly doubt i will use him again until he does.. Iv msg him telling him i will make him to most easy dummmies guide to PGP someone can get, and i dont get a reply so i guess thats his way of saying &#039;fuck off&#039; &#039; .. Encryption is not hard AT ALL and should be a must..Well at least for buyers, I understand a Vendor will not say &#039;HEY U DID NOT ENCRYPT!!! NO DRUGS!!&quot; cause i dont really think a seller not encrypting will hurt a vendor, Could it? Whats a Vendors POV on PGP? Im curious.. Btw im not trying to change the subject of this thread, but i saw where one person said they wanted to know how to keep their ass out of jail, and the last few posts are 1 good way..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey bro this dummies guide to pgp that a retard could understand. Any chance you could describe where to get it? Of course im fantastically proficient in pgp its not for me like, ... its for a friend... yea definately for a friend... ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Go to the Security section bro.. In my Post i was speaking of something i said i would make for a vendor so it would be as simple as possible.. Even though it pretty much is on the forums as well but it seems some dont bother to come here.. You cant miss the thread for it in the security forums. After you download it and give it a little read and wanna test it let me know and id be glade to do that for you..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Honestly, if they made the link to the forums at the top of the main page of SR instead of at the bottom, more people would be on the forums.

You&#039;re better off storing the bootloader on a CD or flash drive, that way the encrypted partition just looks like random data. Keep the bootloader disk on you at all times, that way if you get a knock at the door, you can crush the CD inside of a garbage can and pretend it &quot;broke&quot; the day before.

He was jailed under a new law that came into effect 2006 in Britain that waived somebody&#039;s right to be tried beyond reasonable doubt regarding the release of encryption keys. He was sentenced for something ASSUMED on his computer. Also, in U.S., the FBI set up a &quot;honeypot&quot; composed of false links that suggested underage material. The link, once clicked, lead to an error page, but police arrested him (under pretense of inquiring about his car while undercover) and charged him with intent, not possession, of downloading something even though no illegal material ever reached his PC. Don&#039;t know of outcome as fairly recent. People were outraged the FBI could charge someone without &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; standard of law, or even committing a crime. The U.K. and U.S. in these situations both disregarded this requirement.<br /><br />But you&#039;re right on when you say <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95761.msg685042#msg685042">Quote from: astor on December 27, 2012, 09:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The 5th Amendment is an awesomely antiquated tool, in that, unlike ECPA, it provides more protection than modern government and LE would allow. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />........ and that if postmodern lawmakers had their way, they wouldn&#039;t even allow us to have that.

				I don&#039;t think there is any way to find out how many vendors are arrested and how many have gone private or are on vacation other than reading through court cases or something like that. Even then there is going to be a ton of lag time between the arrest and the information becoming available.

				when busted... never say anything to the police... even if you are innocent. if you are innocent, eventually cops will figure that out. But talking to the cops, expecially when you are innocent is bad, because before they even approach you, they have their entire case, and list of charges and story ready, they just try to give you a line of questioning that will prove their case. EVEN if you are innocent. <br /><br />coz one thing is for sure, remember, what ever you say, its going to be your word against theirs....<br /><br />they can say, &quot;i asked the defendant if he had drugs on him during our conversation and he replied yes, and he said distributed it on a daily basis&quot;<br /><br />sure you can say you didn&#039;t say that or whatever, but when its a drug dealers word against a cops, cops always win. But if you didnt say anything at all, then yeah thats going to be hard coz no one heard you talk one word.<br /><br />so if you get busted, just stfu and let the nice policeman do his job, don&#039;t go doing his job for him by talking. You aint gonna talk your way out of anything. If you have a big sob story, save it for the judge during sentencing.<br />

				I&#039;ve been looking into Tails a bit and apparently it&#039;s not as secure as it could be for your particular use.<br /><br />The developers of tails have it setup out of the box to work well for people who are more benifited by having a a larger likelyhood that some but never all of their internet traffic is intercepted where a vendor needs 100% anonimity.<br /><br />The flaw with tails, for you, is that Tails uses a lot of entry gaurds. This increases the chance that LE controls both the entry and exit node you are using and at particular time.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read so far, and I am not an expert by any means, you would want to limit the number of entry gaurds you use by either messing around in Tails or by using Liberte.<br /><br />Liberte has a setup that&#039;s more condusive to vending as you are much more likely to have 100% anonimity, however, if you were pwned then the atacker would see a much higher percentage of your traffic.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;d say that while your setup is OK, it&#039;s entirely possible LE in your country or another can potentially figure out who you are by running a number of entry gaurds and as you cycle through those quickly in Tails your risk of getting identified increases.<br /><br />If you are going to continue running Tails with no modifications I think something that may help is using a computer specifically for vending and only using it on public or anon wifi in random places.<br /><br />Would be nice to hear someone who knows more about this stuff rambple for a while.

It really all depends on how strong your passwords are. Remember, the security of a 256 bit AES encryption key depends on the bit strength of the password used to encrypt it.

				Bad Idea, hidemyass.com was recently found to have handed over logs of its users to law enforcement despite claiming it keeps no logs.<br /><br />You can Google it or even look on their own website where they try to defend having done it. In the &#039;privacy policy&#039; section I think.

				.........&nbsp; ^^^ I think they are a cop people... shhhhhhh<br /><br />seriously though<br /><br />&quot;This is a war on drugs and the people behind it are the users creating demand. Alongside the pushers all too ready to supply that demand at the expense of our society. Killing users as well as neighborhoods to line their own pockets.&quot;<br /><br />where to start? so by the logic you have used there the users are the front line of soldiers in this war? kinda like if there wasn&#039;t any fences (sellers of stolen goods) and buyers there would be no thieves huh? And pushers? interesting choice of language used there. Facilitators would be the other end of that scale and both are gross generalizations and well in line with someone indoctrinated in the propaganda regarding prohibition and the inherent evil of drugs and the people who are involved in them. That last line is just pathetic. So you would be a believer in &quot;the problems of society are there because of drugs&quot; I&#039;m thinking? A more accurate mindset would be &quot;the drugs are there because of the problems&nbsp; of society&quot; Not all dealers &#039;push&#039; their wares on people, in fact I don&#039;t know of any dealer that actively pushes drugs but rather sells drugs to those that seek them out, so this is just plain old offensive and dangerous ignorance. <br /><br />The people behind the war on drugs are the world governments and law enforcement. They started it, they continue it and they justify its costs in human terms and all others through puppets like yourself dribbling shit like this.. The reason law enforcement often target the last rung on the ladder, the users, is because they are the soft targets and they are too incompetent or dirty to go after the big timers. They, the users, are the ones that feed the statistics that they use to justify their jobs and to feel powerful from. They have made no impact on drugs in the real world beyond moving the cartels out of Columbia and into Mexico, from Coke to Meth as the &#039;cream&#039; product, removing the small amount of restraint the big boys had by hunting them down and killing or incarcerating them leaving situations like the Mexico situation which is such that the death squads or enforcement gangs that once did as they where told are now in charge and killing as they see fit and entrenching big pharma as the only real pushers left in the world so its unlikely that they will be able to stop in in the cyber world They are idiots, thugs and dirty and are only saved by the disgusting amount of money and resources they have. <br /><br />I really want to go on and on but honestly know I&#039;ll just be trying to teach a tree to swim or or dirt to fly...&nbsp; PGP will save those who can back it up with silence and a request for a lawyer if ever targeted by these letches.<br /><br />Fuck it, its not finished but....<br /><br />&#039;Enjoy these times we are part of as free and alive people, truly masters of our universe.. Celebrate this miracle and evolution; the globalization and digitization of the civil disobedience against the draconian and oppressive war on drugs and the world wide prohibition that&#039;s been in place for just too long. This is the new age that we are the pioneers and architects of… this is our counter war against misinformation and oppression or as I like to call our online nation and we its members; the Peoples Freedom Fighters for The Republic Of Why The Fuck Can&#039;t I have Safe and Clean Drugs Island (or PFFFTROWTFCIHSACD for short). Finally we are able to wind back the damage done by the hypocritical generation that had its cake and ate it too and now has the Gaul to say we can&#039;t do the same all while lamenting at us that the universe would tear apart and we would all be raging psychotic loons if we were let to take these toxic poisons made from demons souls and peddled by sub human animals.. Forget that their generation literally got fucked up for weeks at a time on LSD, Coke and every other substance they could and they survived along with the fabric of time/space and the universe at large…. because it was different then... It just was OK? I heard that the &#039;DEA&#039; big guns have now found that it was the war on drugs that saved the world on 21/12/2012.. True story... ;-)<br /><br />So eat, drink and smell the bounty of sustenance at our disposal and while you’re at it have a feed, a drink and share good words with those of a like mind and marvel at the possibilities that we are creating for our children&#039;s children. By their time we will surely have realized the error and re-educated the masses striking aside the false and dangerous propaganda that&#039;s been indoctrinated so deeply in even the minds of even the most sane and intelligent members of our civilisation and they, our ancestors, will truly live in an enlightened age filled with exploration of the evolution of our minds and bodies into more than just living, working, breading and dying drones. No they will be unlocking the universe by unlocking our own inner universe of power, understanding and compassion. Make the most of these days of holidays and rest because there is much work to be done to see this happen and it’s on people like you, me and the ones out there that are respectable, productive and civilized souls that live their double lives, working and paying taxes and being perfect imitation automatons while supplementing and enhancing their existence with the medicines and tonics considered &#039;illicit&#039;, too afraid to be unashamedly true to their own self and beliefs just yet. If only they understood they are the majority and not the evil dilettantes as claimed by the puppets of big Pharma and those that would see the world run as a giant farm of docile and compliant &#039;worker&#039; humans and they will one day, if we are able to be a cohesive resistance movement that is organized and driven to quantified goals, be shown this as fact.. Like they; the misguided DEA agents, law enforcement officers and health workers, are a tool of suppression that is organized and driven to quantified goals with money and resources directed towards achieving these goals while undermining and fracturing our effort in same, only once we too have moved from the stockpiling of money by a few and put it to use by tooling and educating the ones that would be able to counter and conquer these oppressors, that&#039;s us all, we can also mold the world to the paradise we know it could be by freeing the truth and taking the worlds single biggest industry,&nbsp; &nbsp;which is a generator of money and work on a scale like no other, out from the darkness and into place where we have it working for us and financing the medical research, the study of Maths and Physics and Chemistry, The building of our Schools and roads and libraries, the feeding and housing and clothing of all peoples of this species. How could it not be so that if we took the combined sum of moneys and resources expended on enforcing the status quo and punishing the crimes of substance abuse, most of which are a direct result of the forcing underground and dehumanizing of recreational drug takers to ensure the continued committing of petty crimes as their options are slowly taken from them and their minds poisoned by tainting the substances with heavy metals and free radicals as is achieved by withholding the clean ingredients so easily and cheaply produced but leaving access to industrial products and adapted alternatives, and the other side which is the spastic amount of money spent worldwide on these drugs together? It is almost impossible to know exactly what this combined total would come to but it is easy to understand that there is a domino effect in terms of the costs and effects of this system we have in place. To paraphrase a US Police Officer filmed in a processing center in Las Vegas, which unlike the jails which are Corrections jurisdiction are run by the police force themselves, on the popular US reality show called Cops “we see some of these people very often and even some on a daily basis for public intoxication, usually on drugs, and other misdemeanors like public nuisance and resist etc. They keep us busy so much so that a lot of us wouldn’t have anything to do without them. We would more than likely not have these jobs” which on the face sounds like a good thing right? Jobs for cops, those with records and addictions need not apply, and the jobs for the builders of the centers and jails right through to the workers at the electricity plant that powers the Tasers being charged, doors being locked and lights being on 24/7. If we look at it again though we can ask things like;<br /><br />&nbsp;‘What else could these people be doing? Why couldn’t the cops be doing other mindless tasks? With the enforcing of these laws through physical and mental force being the ultimate of these ‘don’t question why or think about it just do it’ jobs is (again to quote “we don’t make the laws we just enforce them” and “that’s for the Judge to decide” this tells you just how the loyalty and dedication in these people has been manipulated into them being basically armed thugs with a list of what’s OK and what’s not as outlined by legislation often 30 or more years old) Perhaps tasks like quality control on assembly lines is something they are well suited to? <br />Why couldn’t the builders have been building a school or hospital or road? <br />Why can’t that power be used to run the super computers which can model and solve the mysteries of the world and universe or any number of other things such as providing warmth, cooking or refrigeration? <br />Surely if the drugs are taken from the organized crime gangs and developed to improve our civilization and people rather than gain the highest profit and be the most addictive, as is the case today for the vast majority of what’s out there today, we could see a world where people can improve their performance, improve their relationships and enjoy peaceful rest every night without the risk of incarceration and without being ‘recorded’ as a lower class of citizen? <br />Isn’t that what our military, elite athletes and others in ‘approved’ roles are given access to in some cases? Are they not also the elite top performers of their industry, perhaps due to rather than in spite of, the ‘medicating’ schedules that include the very same drugs that are denied the average citizen?’<br />These Jet Pilots, Special Forces and medical professionals (Politician like John Kennedy who took daily injections of various amphetamines could also be counted here) are considered the top 2-5% of our species… but how can this be if drugs are evil and they the reason for all the breakdowns in civilization the world over? The other 98% are left to their own devices and restricted in their access to any of the ‘Pharmaceutical grades’ of these substances while also being denied the guidance and support from the Doctors and medical technologies available and with adulterants (often the harmful thing to the health of the taker) added in, the combination of which simply makes it an almost certainty that they will use dirty substances and what’s available to them rather than what’s best for them which again just herds them down the path to mental illness and criminal behavior.&nbsp; When they are taking these substances they are called illicit drug users or ‘Junkies’, amongst other things, and the question is asked of them “are you clean?” as if there is a stain on them, their soul and character, and they are an unclean person. A stain that these elite military and other ‘approved’ subsets of our societies are immune to it seems. They are taking a ‘prescription medication’ under the guidance of health professional though and the meth/amphet/opiate/benzo they are given is a clean medication, not a dirty illicit drug you see...&#039;<br /><br />Just a few thoughts I put to document the other day.....<br /><br />

				Took me a while to figure out what you meant, En See. DeePeeAh’s sig has indeed changed, just not the one I was thinking of. Between November 12 – 17 PGP key changed to reflect a different PGP. Went from GNU/Linex to MingW32. I presume W is Windows. 32 is 32bit. Does that actually matter? Not everyone is at your technical level En See. Maybe astor and a few others.

				I have had a buyer&#039;s account for some time, but recently I&#039;ve noticed a lot of vendors missing form the psychedelic and ecstasy sections. Is this related to busts, are there already threads about this that people could link me? There used to be a lot of LSD and MDMA vendors and within around a two month span the number dropped to nearly none. I really don&#039;t want to use bmr because the prices aren&#039;t very competitive, especially price per mic of LSD, but SR is worrying me now.

Most issues you have can most likely be solved by downloading specific nightly builds from https://nightly.gpgtools.org/.
