				Ok Ive tried to purchase bitcoins from 5 seperate vendors and not one had any. Why the fuck have a listing and say &quot;we have plenty&quot; and you add to cart and then its cancelled because theyre out. What the fuck do I have to do to get Bitcoins. As a Vendor, if I was out of inventory I would take down my listing. I wouldnt leave it up for people to think they&#039;re getting my product and 2 days later I cancel the order. There should be some sort of quality control. I guess because Bitcoins have tanked they dont wanna sell til the price goes up. Thats fine just dont list your fuckin product til your ready to sell.<br /><br />Ok Rant Over

				here you go brotha: https://get-bitcoin.com/<br /><br />that&#039;s how I get all my btcs. and specifically...CASH deposits at bank of america OR chase. no need for an ID. all anonymous. just fill out the first page of that site (you can use fake names, whatever) just make sure the email is real. once you fill it out, they send you an email with an account number and their business name and your order #. write down everything. go to chase or boa with yo cash, fill out a deposit slip. write their business under &quot;account holder&quot;. write the account number they gave you under &#039;account number&#039;. get the cash right. wait in line. wait till your called. hit on the bank teller. tell that sexy beeotch that you are making a sexy deposit into a business account that isn&#039;t yours. they will take that sexy deposit slip and ask absolutely no questions. hit on the teller a little more. and she (or he...whatevs) hands you a receipt. keep that sucka and take a picture of it. and email that receipt to getbitcoins along with your order #(the address is in the email they sent you). btcs will be in your account in 12 hours. maybe less. maybe more. but no more than 22 hours.

				and I would recommend setting up a btc account somewhere else outside of SR for them to send them too.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; then from that account, send them to your sr account. of course, this method is a little longer than buying them from here - but it guarantees that btcs will always be available for you

Why not just go to mtgox and buy directly from the primary marketplace and get the best possible market rates? It&#039;s not difficult to get an account and get it funded. <br /><br />
