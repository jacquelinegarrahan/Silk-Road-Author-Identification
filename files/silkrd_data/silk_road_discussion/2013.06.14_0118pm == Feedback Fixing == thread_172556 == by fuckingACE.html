				So most of you probably don´t give to much of a fuck as buyers, but those who are more integrated into the community might want to shed some light on weather you think it correct that admin is able to remove or modify feedback in certain cases. <br /><br />Today we encountered our first instance of feedback fixing. <br /><br />Logged onto the site only to find that someone had left a 1/5 not arrived dont trust this saler...<br /><br />Now the purchase looked odd from the beginning. came from same country, was a single order for our cheapest item, hardly any stats.&nbsp; I´m kicking myself for not having cancelled it but then I want to give as many of you a fair chance to order from us as possible, I don´t want to have to turn people away, cause it really sucks. We sell items that other people don´t stock so often people sign up to the site just to make a purchase from us, and I would feel so shitty to have to tell them no, you have to go buy 3 items you don´t want first and then you can buy from me. <br /><br />Well basically this guy buys 1 of our cheapest item, leaves that feedback before the resolution center option comes up, just finalizes, makes no attempt to contact us and leaves not arrived dont trust this saler... Now this order comes from the same country as my main competitor, and the spelling of saler is typically the same mistake made by the nationality of my main competition, purchase was made a day after we put up all our listings that affect my main competitions market..... Putting two and two together I think its pretty obvious this was left specifically to harm our reputation. <br /><br />Admin´s policy is to not remove or alter feedback unless it contains identifying info or can do someone harm, well I think in this case it does, it does us harm, they don´t realize how much a 1/5 affects our stats and if vendors with that kind of mentality see its tolerated they´ll all be creating free accounts and placing shitty 12$ orders with their competition and writing shit like SCAMMER stay away. <br />How many people would order from someone seeing that that was their latest feedback?<br /><br />If they don´t protect us against shit like that I´ll be the first to start implementing FE for anyone who hasn´t ordered from me before. <br /><br />ACE

				How will your act of implementing FE for anyone who hasn´t ordered from you before protect you from competitors who buy cheap stuff from you only to destroy your feedback?

				Hi Ace (or maybe i should say hola Ace)<br /><br />Sorry to here people fucking with your business, but i just wanted to say i have had a look at your vendor page and would consider myself a potential customer, i have made 2 transactions both of which were very small totaling maybe 40 euro(both arrived). However because i am new to this i refuse to buy large amounts, and when i do buy i stay in escrow, i think you need to think about this as the feedback that was left would deter newer customers experienced SR users will check more than one page of reviews before buying.<br /><br />So i guess my message is please think threw before requiring newb&#039;s to FE. Otherwise it will be a while before i can try your fantastically priced outdoor Weed.

				Yes, cheap tricks like will have a negative impact on this beautiful market which Silkroad is. If you have enough evidence to be sure and convince people that your competitor is the one who is responsible for screwing your stats show this and this will reduce the trust the buyers have toward your competitor which again will discourage this kind of behavior.

				Sadly I don&#039;t think there&#039;s really any way to shield yourself from that kind of trouble; the only thing one can do is having an admin check the feedback and change it accordingly (as you have done). Maybe however you can go on the offensive yourself and let users know who the vendor that does this is; I for one would never do business with someone like that since I cannot tolerate lack of dignity (you don&#039;t certainly need to bring a competitor down; if you have the need to do so it means your products by themselves don&#039;t warrant you competing, but that&#039;s not the problem of the other vendor but of yourself).<br /><br />Asking to FE will change nothing; a competitor vendor having so little dignity as to do something like that really cannot care less about creating multiple new accounts for small items and FE them all giving bad feedback.<br /><br />Sadly there are many great, respectful and beautiful people in the SR but (luckily in the minority) there are also imbeciles, stupid and totally irrespectful individuals around, and you cannot do much to shield yourself from these people given that this system is based on absolute freedom of speech and anonymity (as it should be).

				As a buyer i find it&#039;s shit knowing there is a small minority of people on the road doing this,<br />also it scares me as a buyer that Vendors are also scamming,<br />so what would they be like with customers??<br />dont think they will last long though eh i think<br />&nbsp;its just one of those hazards as a S.R vendor<br />just hope they can do away wi all these folk.

				Thanks for all your great responses. Yeah, I see what you mean, I like to think that one of the things that makes us special is that we will never ever ask a buyer to FE. So i would like to keep it that way. Just wishing there was some just way we could appeal feedback <br />ACE

				A couple things are on your side. Ratings from new accounts with little or no purchase history are weighted less. Also, the feedback is weighted by half each month, so in the long term it is worth zero as long as you keep vending and your recent ratings are good.

				You can only keep on keepin&#039; on and hope that you have a solid customer base from those you have delivered countless 5/5 experiences.&nbsp; SR Support will do absolutely nothing to help, although I suppose they are limited by the process...&nbsp; Best of luck overcoming the scammer, it is not a fun time.

				Hi Ace - as a new vendor I totally see where you&#039;re coming from...<br /><br />I&#039;ve not had same (YET) but fully expect similar - and where is our recourse? I think the ability to simply respond (like one might on ebay etc) with our side of the coin, might at least allow a more fair view to be taken.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Doc<br />
