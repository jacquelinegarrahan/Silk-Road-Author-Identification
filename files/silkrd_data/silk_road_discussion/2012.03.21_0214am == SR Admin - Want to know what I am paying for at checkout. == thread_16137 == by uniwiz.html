				I agree. If SR/DPR feel that the fees are fair then they should be easy to see. Yes, they are in the silk road address, but it&#039;s x% on a amount and y% on b amount etc. Just make it simple.<br /><br />Price of item = x<br />SR fees = y<br />Total cost = z<br /><br />Every receipt has the taxes on it, why not here?

				+1<br /><br />I do think this would serve as a useful feature. I think automatically publishing that information in an easy to read format (for all orders) would actually encourage growth of the site. <br /><br />But<br /><br />Some people could get upset if it ends up sounding like SR is making a lot of money. I&#039;m sure most everyone here thinks that SR should be rewarded for all it takes to run this place, not to mention many of the new useful feature developments. One aspect to consider could be that SR may not want to make it easier to quantify the amount of money he&#039;s making, simply so the figure&#039;s not out there to spark outrage among politicians or other&#039;s who are haters. He&#039;s risking his freedom in a huge way to put this site up and I hope he&#039;s making plenty. Either way, he&#039;s published his commission percentages.<br /><br />I&#039;ve encountered many buyers unfamiliar with the fee rate so towards the bottom I have a breakdown in terms that I find are easy to understand.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the format for the fee structure which some of you may find helpful to demystify the formula as it isn&#039;t a flat rate, I realized it is published in a few other places but here goes:<br /><br />For any item sold SR taxes:<br /><br />- The first $50 of pre-commission value&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@ 10%<br />- The next $100 of pre-commission value&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@ 8.5%<br />- The next $150 of pre-commission value&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@ 6%<br />- The next $200 of pre-commission value&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@ 3%<br />- The next $500 of pre-commission value&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@ 2%<br />- Any amount exceeding $1000 of pre-commission value&nbsp; @ 1.5%<br /><br />It&#039;s based on dollar amount, not BTC be aware.<br /><br />If the feature someday comes, cool. But until then a little math with help you estimate pretty accurately if it&#039;s something you really want to know. I don&#039;t think new features can just be pumped out like an assembly line.<br /><br />Rocker

				Good point.<br /><br />Steps have been taken recently to obfuscate the amount that sellers make from here, it would seem counterintuitive for DPR to publish the same data relating to his profits.

I&#039;ve gotten tax back on stranger things.<br /><br />I would also like to see a breakdown of the fees at checkout- It can be especially frustrating when checking out listed deals only to find the total price in BTC disproportionate to the expected rate after exchange...<br /><br />Just something like &quot;TOTAL: XX.xx BTC including XX.xx BTC in SR Fees&quot; would be fine.

				From a vendor&#039;s perspective, some more details on orders would be helpful.&nbsp; Specifically what the btc rate was when the order was calculated.&nbsp; I stay exposed in escrow so the btc price swings.&nbsp; I like to keep good books, but without some of the order details it&#039;s only a vague calculation.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />-TB

				Thanks guys for your support.<br />I am not knocking the SR Admin, and they shouldn&#039;t be afraid to show they make some money.<br />What I&#039;m stupid, nobody is making any money?<br />That wasn&#039;t my point.<br />The numbers at times don&#039;t add up.<br />Simple constructive thing, that isn&#039;t that hard to code.<br />Thanks for the math, but I want it at checkout :&#039;(<br /><br /><br />

				I noticed SR has a time lapse for prices to be updated to current BTC exchange rate. Might that be the reason why the BTC rate feature is removed? It&#039;s to prevent further misunderstanding.

				I don&#039;t need a receipt, but knowing the current value of a BTC on SR would be great.&nbsp; I hate paying X.XX amount of dollars, only to transfer them here and find out that they are worth less on SR.&nbsp; I understand hedged escrow everything, but just knowing what a BTC is worth on here would help everyone figure out how much we are are really spending after we pay the fees for USD deposits and then pay for the BTC with that money.<br /><br />People like me who use bitinstant also have an almost 5% direct deposit fee, so that shit adds up too.

				To know the current value of BTC on SR you can keep Exactly 1 BTC in your account and then just change it to &quot;display prices in Dollars&quot; in your settings.&nbsp; This of course is only convenient if you don&#039;t normally keep money on SR

				I think some obfuscation is intentional here.<br /><br />Specifically, the btc/usd exchange related to hedging.<br /><br />When you place your order, your BTC get exchanged for USD on a market.<br />Then when you press &quot;finalize&quot; those USD are exchanged for BTC again, and a released to the vendor.<br /><br />These exchanges are not done immediately, and not for the whole amount at one time; <br />this is done to prevent identification of the SR market(s) account(s) based on timing.<br /><br /><br />I think the hedging-related fee could still be displayed at the end, but I can understand why DPR may want<br />to keep it obfuscated as it is - to prevent identification of his account(s) based on rates.<br /><br />&nbsp;The hedging fee is on the vendor side though, so there&#039;s nothing preventing SR to display <br />the price breakdown to the buyer, as far as I can see.<br />

				The hedging fee is approximately 4% and that info has not been hidden, as far as I know. Vendors are able to see how much they get from each transaction in USD (or, btc*(SRs BTCUSD ticker)). It may go only slightly above 4% as well as under 4% (it has to do whether the price is on a downslope or going up), I have checked for a good amount of transactions and can confidently say that the hedging mechanism is fair play on SRs part.

If it&#039;s 4% then item $100 + $4 (herge fee) + etc.<br />I guess the vendors enjoy explaining the SR fee structure, over, and over.<br /><br />It seems using E-bay, and Amazon, as examples only when it suits your agenda. :P<br /><br />

				from the buyer&#039;s guide:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Escrow hedge<br />Unfortunately, the Bitcoin exchange rate isn&#039;t as stable as we would all like it to be, and can fluctuate wildly in a matter of hours, let alone the days or weeks it takes for a package to arrive. Because of this, there is a real danger that the Bitcoins being held in your escrow account will lose value by the time your vendor gets paid or you are refunded. So, we&#039;ve given the option to vendors to hedge the future payments they are expecting from escrow such that the dollar value of the payment doesn&#039;t change as the Bitcoin exchange rate changes.<br /><br />For example, a seller is hedging the escrow for a 10 btc order you place with them, and the dollar value of your order when you purchase it is $100. Now, let&#039;s say your order never arrives and your vendor agrees to a full refund, but those 10 btc are no longer worth $100, they&#039;re worth $50! Because your vendor hedged the escrow, you won&#039;t get a refund of 10 btc, you&#039;ll get 20 btc equaling the original value of $100. Of course, the opposite is also true. If Bitcoins appreciate in value while your order is in escrow, your refund will be fewer Bitcoins, but still equaling the original dollar value.<br /><br />When checking out, you will see which orders will be hedged and which won&#039;t. After the order is placed, your escrow balance will reflect the dollar value of your hedged orders and the Bitcoin value of your unhedged orders. All hedged orders are hedged as soon as the order is placed. So when getting a refund for hedged items, don&#039;t be surprised if the number of Bitcoins you get back is not the same as the amount you paid.<br /><br />If you need the most up-to-date USD/BTC exchange rate, we recommend mtgoxlive.com. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />from the seller&#039;s guide:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You may also choose whether to set your price before or after commission is added. If you choose &quot;pre-commission pricing&quot;, the price you set will be the amount of money you are paid when a transaction is complete, but your customers will see a higher price that includes the commission. If you choose &quot;post-commission pricing&quot;, you set the price that your customers pay. When you get paid, the amount you receive will be less than this by the amount of the commission. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />The commission is between the site and the vendors.&nbsp; The price you pay at checkout is the price you pay.&nbsp; The costs that go into that price are irrelevant to the checkout process.&nbsp; Whether they are currency&nbsp; exchange costs, labor costs, materials, cost from suppliers, or the commission.&nbsp; If it&#039;s too high, don&#039;t buy.&nbsp; the only thing you have to worry about is the part in the buyer&#039;s guide about the escrow hedge.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t buy from sellers who hedge.&nbsp; And no, amazon doesn&#039;t display their commission at checkout for the same reasons.

				Good explanation.<br />Even explains why it&#039;s so confusing.<br />So I have to know if the seller has hedging turned on, and how they set some kind of cost option, that seems silly to me.<br /><br />Got me on Amazon reference. Here&#039;s the problem, both Amazon, and E-bay hide costs in shipping, and handling.<br />Too much, don&#039;t buy, like you said. They don&#039;t charge when a vendor cancels an order.<br />Now if I&#039;m forced to FE, why should I need hedging? That cost should be the vendor&#039;s.<br /><br />At least I see the BTC, that was a plus.<br /><br />I tried&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are more important issues.<br />Until there is competition, which doesn&#039;t seem imminent.<br />The buyer&#039;s only choice is as you said.<br /><br />

				I would like to see this as well.<br /><br />My main concern with it being shown for buyers, which anyone can sign up for, is that an LEO will come to the site, put an item in cart and see the itemized total with how much goes towards SR, the vendor and the product. This is WAY too much information for them to find readily. This would allow them to total up numbers REALLY fast, right now I am assuming they are merely guessing that the amount of money obtained by SR is very small and thus not worth their time. Along with the amount of product. <br /><br />Let&#039;s keep it that way.

				Sorry, felt I had to chime in since I saw DPR in this thread.&nbsp; I know you (he, her, they, them) try your best to run this site with fees that are necessary for uptime costs, extreme risks, etc, and (somewhat) understand the fees.&nbsp; <br /><br />But what about those who pay the fees and have been scammed?&nbsp; Sorry to beat an old fish to death but SR gets a commission on the scams just the same as a legitimate sale.&nbsp; Maybe it should be a new thread, but shouldn&#039;t buyers who fall to scammers at least get the SR commission back? And possibly vice versa? <br /><br />Just a thought and maybe new a new thread would be justified for this matter as it is a somewhat different topic.&nbsp; Just putting in my thoughts.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks to uniwiz who always brings thoughtful topics to the table!

Scammers are already crafty as hell, they don&#039;t need a way to literally take money from SR. Perhaps the funds would be better served towards better prevention methods.
