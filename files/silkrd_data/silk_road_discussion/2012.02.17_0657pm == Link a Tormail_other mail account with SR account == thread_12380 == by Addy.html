				Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love the idea of needing nothing more than a username/password to join a site- no tedious e-mail checking for confirmation numbers, linking CC numbers, etc. And we walk a thin line between security and site functionality; that is, there will never be an option for a thumbs up next to products you&#039;ve purchased that will then send a message to your Facebook account that you &quot;like&quot;d a particular vendor or product, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />All that being said, I think the option of linking a Tormail (or other mail associated with the deep web) account to your SR account could be beneficial in a few ways. A group e-mail whenever the site is down, special offers from vendors you frequently use, etc. In particular I thought of this idea when I could not access SR for a few days for whatever reason (site was down or just loaded too slowly), and a couple vendors I purchased product from had to wait the extra couple days to receive their BTC. I&#039;m sorry that had to happen, and perhaps if I was in communication with DPR via e-mail, he could have finalized my orders by request.<br /><br />Anyway, just a thought- give people the option of linking their SR account to an e-mail account so they can be in the loop whenever SR and its forums are down, let them know about special offers from vendors, etc.<br /><br />I welcome all suggestions and critiques.
