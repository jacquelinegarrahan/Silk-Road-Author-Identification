				Do you think it&#039;s worth investing in the current rate (around â‚¬110) or wait for it to fall a bit first? I guess the question is will it fall first before it rises again

				There&#039;s an eerie faith in Bitcoin at the moment. Reading the reddit board is starting to feel more like a cult than a currency system.

If you spend $140 and it crashes to $30 just keep hold of it.

				One would think it&#039;s too late but then people go on putting millions into bitcoin and the price shoots up. So just bank on people throwing millions into bitcoin. Until that stops the price will keep going up and if the price keeps going up people will throw million in to make money. It&#039;ll never end. I heard Mitt Romney is gonna unload his retirement fund into bitcoins thanks to Obama.

				Definatley still worth investing, just theres not as much possibility to gain as much as a profit as if you bought them a couple months back obviously.<br /><br />I see them rising steadily with the occasional drops here and there, we will have to wait for when all the bitcoins have been mined to get a good idea of its final price

In order&nbsp; for me to break even I need to sell at $85. If I buy more bitcoins that number will go up. Of course at first you will have to expect dips so I wouldn&#039;t sell right away. Over the last 30 days it went from $45 to $155. Look for more of the same this month.

				It&#039;s not too late. Believe me. I&#039;ve made thousands and thousands of dollars. In fact, I laughed this morning because I just placed an order yesterday, and the BTC was taken out of my account and put in escrow. I was out partying last night and didn&#039;t check the btc rate. I woke up this morning and checked my SR account and had MORE money then I had BEFORE I placed the order. Yes, you read that right. The BTC value is going up faster then you can spent it drugs as crazy as that sounds. I put in 5k or so when it was at like 32 USD.... it&#039;s 5 times that now. Even with the fact that I&#039;ve been buying some of the most expensive drugs on the road I STILL have over $20k just sitting there smiling at me.&nbsp; The value has shot up 1400% in ONE YEAR. If it keeps going at this rate, we will hit $1,000/BTC by December and I will be a quarter millionaire! Christ. Ok.. time to be realistic. It will keep going up for sure, but not forever.&nbsp; Right now there is a frenzy. There&#039;s something like 60,000 people waiting to be verified on MTGOX. With all the shit in Cyrprus and EU, people are turning towards btc. Now, it cant KEEP going up forever and will eventually correct itself at some point, That point may be $250, $500, $1k or even $3k/btc. The trick is you have to go with your gut and when it starts falling dramatically either get out or wait it out. I&#039;m gonna wait it out past the correction. When BIG money invests in BTC, it will sky rocket. The bad news is that BIG MONEY are very cautious and not into taking risk. The good news is, it will just take 1 of the BIG MONEY and the others will follow suit.<br /><br />Long story short, its not too late, its never too late. Invest in BTC. The more people invest the better for everyone holding BTC in general including the investor, and including me :)<br /><br />I&#039;m feeling generous. If you&#039;re short a bit on your order pm me and I&#039;ll chuck some coin your way in the next 10 mins.

				WHOOOOOSH<br /><br />It&#039;s never too late if you have an entry and exit strategy <br /><br />When you have bought your coins, try your best not to look at prices. Invest with fear and you will lose money, the moment you see the price fall other investors will be there waiting to take your cheap coins from you

This was because of FAKE FIAT FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES BEING PRINTED LIKE THE DAILY NEWSPAPER AND AN OVER-INVESTMENT OF THEM.<br />&nbsp;<br />Compare to the Bitcoin which is also Fiat but cannot be printed endlessly! The value of the Bitcoin will rise like Gold has throughout history, only today would be compared to somewhere around the start of the great gold rush in California! we&#039;re all heading west for the &quot;BITCOIN RUSH OF THE EARLY 21st CENTURY&quot;<br /><br />ONLY 21 MILLION BITCOINS TO BE INVESTED IN, LIMITED SUPPLY, ALMOST LIKE A PRECIOUS METAL IN MY OPINION!<br /><br />I amongst others here believe we&#039;re almost like revolutionaries and we&#039;re almost sure of it! &#039;&#039; GOOGLE/YOUTUBE PETER SCHIFF, JEFF BERWICK (BITCOIN), RON PAUL!! Folks the dollar is going to collapse and many of us and our families are going to go bankrupt overnight through hyperinflation of the dollar. And if we do, we were foolish because we weren&#039;t informed and aware. I think most have been and some now are Informed. <br /><br />Could the Bitcoin save us from financial ruin? Save us from the FEDERAL RESERVE at least until they shut down the internet in America?<br /><br />And no we&#039;re not &quot;just too high&quot; as i heard mentioned earlier, though sadly&nbsp; :o Without my medicine (Cannabis) I&#039;m OK but go to other drugs not as &quot;natural&quot;&nbsp; to alter my consciousness :&#039;(&nbsp; and end up ranting&nbsp; :o<br /><br />And I&#039;m a broke 19 yrs. old student who only has about a grand invested in due to studying over wage labour, who&#039;s not gonna ask for any tiny donations for his research and input from all you rich investors *wink*&nbsp; :D&nbsp; In all actuality in case one older gent is kind enough,&nbsp; personal message for address!

				Great comments here guys. Lots of laughs to be had.&nbsp; ;D Personally, I&#039;m thinking the price is only going to keep rising as a lot of older members than me have stated. I recently emailed with MtGox support and they told me they were trying to at least double in staff in the next 3 weeks for what they expect with be an exponential growth in the market. As some of you have already stated, they certainly feel this rise in price is just the tip of a profitable, virtual iceberg. <br /><br />Not sure if this has been posted yet but for those of you who read, an interesting article done by the New York Times. Clearnet: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/business/media/bubble-or-no-virtual-bitcoins-show-real-worth.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0<br /><br />I&#039;m excited to see what comes of the 2013 Bitcoin conference. The idea of a virtual, nontaxed currency is &quot;too good to be true&quot; in a lot of aspects, I think it baffles both investors and us on the Road alike. Whether or not we are talking about a bubble here, I don&#039;t see the price of Bitcoin falling any time soon. And I&#039;m hanging on to mine, spending the profits here on the Road, and enjoying riding the wave that is BTC.&nbsp; 8)

				Right on dude. We HAVE to spend it at least somewhat to keep it healthy. If its just being hoarded eventually people will lose confidence and bail the fuck out of dodge. If you spend, not only do you get your awesome drugs from this awesome site, but you keep the flow of BTC moving instead of standstill. Also, at the rate this badboy is rising, even if you bought the more expensive items on SR, you would STILL gain every day. It&#039;s gaining faster then we can get high with it.&nbsp; :o

Day trading is no good for your health, and if Bitcoin is going to take off nearly half as well as people think it is you&#039;ll get plenty back on even your $140 risk now. If you spend $140 and it crashes to $30 just keep hold of it.

The answer is YES! There is presently a reflexive pattern of folks buying because prices are rising, and prices rising because folks are buying. The myopic are extrapolating the price trend of the last four months, which they deem as normal, and in so doing, they exacerbate it to the upside, thus attracting even greater fools. The inflection point will come when the continuity of bullish thought is broken. One thing is for sure....the amount of suckers left who are willing to jump on the moving and ever accelerating TRAIN is drawing thin....and so are their pockets.

				This conversation is being mentioned on several different forums (eg BitCoinTalk.org and /r/BitCoin) and based on what I&#039;ve read I&#039;m not too worried about a bubble.&nbsp; Even if there were a market correction I doubt it&#039;d go back under 120 at this point.&nbsp; Supply has limited growth but undoubtedly the demand for BTC is increasing rapidly (some would say exponentially).&nbsp; I think these are the biggest factors affecting the price right now.&nbsp; What people forget is that demand is still relatively low (although growing) compared to the overall size of the world economy, and as people learn about BTC they become more and more interested.<br /><br />I&#039;d be more worried of a crash from a cracked alogirthm or something in the vain, personally.&nbsp; Don&#039;t invest your retirement fund or your child&#039;s education savings, only spend what you&#039;re willing to lose and enjoy the ride.&nbsp; Some people will wait for a large crash before buying up and they may be waiting for quite a while....

				Since you&#039;re particularly talking about timing, I&#039;ll repeat what I just said in another btc thread: the risk/reward profile keeps changing (specifically, more risk for less reward as btc climb). When btc were $5, if you put in $1000 and sold when it got to $10/coin, you&#039;d have just made $1000. btc are now... $218 and change. If you put in $1000 and sold when btc rise to $223 (that same $5 hike) you&#039;d have... Just under $1005. Less transaction fees. To get that same $1000 profit, you&#039;d have to sell at $446. Or a tenth that rise but 10x the investment/risk.<br /><br />So yeah. An interested person is in one of three boats: 1) you invested early and are just waiting to see when to jump off this train (and then retire comfortably or at least enjoy a significant expansion of life options), 2) you&#039;re already filthy fucking rich and you can throw $10k in to make $1000 profit (like in the last scenario subsequent paragraph), or any multiple thereof, or 3) you missed the boat, either by a little or a lot and you&#039;re wondering if it&#039;s too late to get any kind of reasonable reward for risk buying in now. In which case, no, you&#039;re waiting for a significant crash so that you can buy in for a reasonable risk/reward ratio.<br /><br />

				Exactly right. There is diminishing returns as well. If you had put in 10k when it was at even at $118 last week, you&#039;d have doubled your money and have $20k. BUT, if you put in $10k today @ 233...you&#039;ll have to wait till it&#039;s at 466 (if/when/ever) to have doubled your money.

				Looks like it&#039;s time for our weekly panic / sell off. The price just dropped $50, although that&#039;s 20% of the peak value, so by relative magnitude it&#039;s not the biggest drop we&#039;ve experienced. Then again, it may not be over yet.

				I think it has become clear that perhaps the weakest link in the currency at this point is the inability for the exchanges to keep up with order demand during these panics (for lack of a better term).&nbsp; What are the other exchanges other than MtGox?<br /><br />We need to have a serious conversation on here, or /r/bitcoin, or bitcointalk.org (they&#039;ve probably already had this convo somewhere but I hate the design of that site) about what needs to be done to make sure these lags don&#039;t occur and what opportunities this may present to experienced web developers.

				It went from $266 to $156. Hell of a sell off, even in relative terms.<br /><br />The market is fucking whacked right now. $36 bid-ask spread, usually it&#039;s less than a dollar. Price is jumping all around. This will take a while to get settled.<br />

The bots are programmed to sell if the lag gets too long, because without information on the current price, that&#039;s considered the safe thing to do. So when MtGox gets a huge lag because of high trade volume, or in this case because of a DDOS attack, that triggers the bots to sell. Of course, that doesn&#039;t explain all of it, but when people see the price dropping, then they panic and sell too.<br /><br />Supposedly that&#039;s what happened during one of the other sell offs back in March. Not the one that went from $48 to $33, that was caused by the block chain hard fork. There was one before that which was also triggered by MtGox lag.<br />

				Here&#039;s another theory about this sell off that I came across:<br /><br />An insider email was leaked onto r/bitcoin a couple weeks ago. Basically a group of rogue traders on Tor organizes a planned DDOS of MtGox at a specific date and time - thus locking out everyone from creating new trades - while simultaneously creating a sell off over 4 hours. The fact that no new trades can be created combined with the price dropping precipitously causes a panic, which grows. At the height of the panic, they buy back in (because they are the ones controlling the DDOS, so they get to make the profitable trades). Everyone else loses their ass who reads the price manipulation as true market price and panics. More people need to understand this because no one is actually panicking at first; it&#039;s price manipulation through the DDOS dropping the price, not actual mass sell off. Still people just blindly look at the price of MtGox and don&#039;t consider this as a possibility even though it&#039;s happened frequently over the last few months. Information is power.<br />

				Didn&#039;t BTC go through a similar &quot;crash&quot; around 2 years ago? <br /><br />I remember reading that at one point BTC were going for about $35, when I joined SR 17 months ago, I was paying a around $1.75 a BTC, so it has lost a considerable amount of value before.

				It sounds like half the people here know what direction the BtC will take. My question is &#039;What are you doing here? You should be at the stock exchange. <br />The fact is no one knows where it will be tomorrow or next week. So the only real answer to this entire thread is - No it&#039;s not to late to invest but just be damned sure you don&#039;t invest anything you can&#039;t afford to lose

				Well, it&#039;s been fascinating.<br /><br />I have what I consider a small stash of BTC. Went to bed and it was 230. Next I set eyes on it it&#039;s in free fall in the 150&#039;s. Well, I&#039;ll be damned if I&#039;m gonna sell at the bottom of a spike, but how low can it go? Pretty low as it turns out. Gox freezes at 120 and announces when they&#039;ll be back up, and I had to wonder what was gonna happen when that market re-opened. My own bet (with no $ behind it - I have nothing but BTC in my account and so wasn&#039;t in a position to buy) was that it would be a case of instant rebound as people rush in to capitalize on the 120. And... nope. <br /><br />Last I checked coins were selling for 102 and standing orders for purchase were about 98, so at least it&#039;s a sane spread at this point. <br /><br />Course, I couldn&#039;t have sold during the fall if I tried, given the lag, but I knew nothing of this. I do remember some *4 thousand people* on standby for purchase orders at 200 the day before. I wonder how many of those people woke up to find out they had at that price purchased BTC in free fall. Maybe the lag saved some of them, long enough to cancel those purchase orders.

				There is no way to tell what direction BTC would be heading next week or even tomorrow.&nbsp; I do know that there is a way to manipulate the market though!&nbsp; <br /><br />I do believe as fucked up as banks are they are the cause of the spike and crash.&nbsp; There was an article about how the banks in Cyprus charged everyone 5-10% of whatever their account balance was causing everyone to withdraw all their money out and buying bitcoin.&nbsp; <br /><br />So what the banks probably did was invest millions and millions into btc causing the price to go up...causing everyone to invest.. and then the banks just dumped all of their coin at once causing price to go down and so then nobody would have any trust in bitcoin. Then people started &quot;panic selling&quot; making the situation even worse. <br /><br />There was over 1 billion dollars lost in the crash.&nbsp; I was watching the market at least 15x an hour. I remember right before the crash the weighted avg was $238 and the last price was then $105.&nbsp; Why on earth would anybody sell coin for half it&#039;s value? It had to be someone deliberately wanting to fuck up the market! <br /><br />I know I&#039;m not no do damn stock brocker but I do love to gamble!! ;)&nbsp; I kinda had fun during its rise.&nbsp; At one point I had made over $6k in profit.&nbsp; I was pissed off&nbsp; cuz I made an order worth $8k while it was at $40 and it took the vendor over 14 days to &quot;prepare&quot; my package and at that time it had already climbed to about $80 or so. If I woulda held on to the coin and never made that purchase, sold at $220 I would&#039;ve made over $40k!! That&#039;s a lot of loot in a short period of time!!!<br /><br />I don&#039;t care what anybody says, as soon as I get more money I&#039;m going to invest more.&nbsp; This has been an experience for me and now I know what to expect during a major crash.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like it crashed in two minutes. If you were watching it, you had a few hours to be able to tell that it was indeed crashing.<br /><br />

				It was definitely a coordinated attack to crash bitcoin: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c3uqd/this_is_a_fucking_disgrace/<br /><br />I can&#039;t find it now, but there was a blog post that talked about a whole bunch of $106 sell orders that were coming in when BTC was at $170 or something like that. So it was a combination of lag (which my or may not have involved a DDOS attack) and coordinated buy/sell orders to influence the price.<br /><br />It was certainly not the bitcoin community suddenly losing confidence in bitcoin en masse -- well, they did, because of the shenanigans, but not spontaneously.<br /><br />However, I&#039;ve seen no evidence that central banks were involved. I think people are having a hard time accepting that random market manipulators could have done this. There&#039;s certainly financial incentive for virtually anyone to do this, not just banks.<br />

				Who knows what was that main cause of the drop.&nbsp; I just know that with more demand, trading, and purchases made with bitcoin (not just SR related) the price will one day MIGHT be worth $500, $1000, or even $10,000 a coin.&nbsp; More and more merchants are accepting BTC as payments. Hopefully more people start actually using them. <br /><br />And just like what has happened in the past, there will be another inflation in the future.&nbsp; It just won&#039;t take as long as it did last time now that more people know about it.<br /><br />I think what I might end up doing is buying a vendors account once I have a bunch of coin I&#039;ve invested. So right when the market is crashing I will create a custom listing for myself and keep my funds in escrow (USD) until the market cools down and prices are stable then cancel the order, giving me more BTC ;) ;);) ;);) ;);) ;);) ;);) ;)<br /><br />Ya some people might call me greedy, I call myself money hungry. ;D I see it as if it makes money it makes sense. And I love making money. I&#039;m damn good at it too!! ;)<br />

				It&#039;s pretty difficult to say what the future for Bitcoin will be.&nbsp; I thought that forsure by now we would be at ~$150 and growing, but instead were down to ~$70 and still going down.

				i really thought the bit would be back at $150 by tomorrow also. it seems like a good amount of investors are getting out... im only going to buy coins as needed until they drop to single digit USD per coin. i would love to have the chance to load up for $7 a coin and forget about it for a year or so... maybe catch the market when it gets high again, just think buying for $7 a coin...... when it gets to $14 you double whatever you put in, $21 is triple, and so on!
