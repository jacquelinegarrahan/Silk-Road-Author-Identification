				Greets all!&nbsp; I&#039;m mostly a lurker here, but have run into a situation that I&#039;m unfamiliar with -- hoping one of ya&#039;ll might be able to clarify.<br /><br />I placed an order with a very trusted vendor last Friday.&nbsp; I&#039;m positive this will work out, but started thinking about what would happen if it didn&#039;t.&nbsp; I now have the option to &#039;cancel&#039; from the orders page.&nbsp; Obviously I want to be judicious about using this feature, so how long do you usually allow something to sit in the &#039;processing&#039; state before you cancel?&nbsp; Are there any negative repercussions for the buyer aside from the potential negative impact to the buyer/seller relationship (e.g. will this affect my buyer stats)?<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, the seller hasn&#039;t been seen on the road in a couple of days, so I&#039;m pretty sure this will get cleared up whenever they return.

				It won&#039;t affect your buyer stats. I&#039;ve only cancelled once. I had some coins which weren&#039;t doing anything much, so I placed an order. The vendor was away for the weekend, so after I had thought about whether I really wanted the product, I cancelled. I&#039;m sure the vendor wouldn&#039;t give a shit, and I may be wrong but the they may not even know you&#039;ve cancelled, if they haven&#039;t got around to doing anything with your order yet.<br /><br />I believe you may get back fewer coins than you paid. Something to do with the fee for a hedged amount, or something.<br /><br />I would say, if there&#039;s anything at all that&#039;s making you feel uncomfortable, cancel.
