				So I made an order for a small sample of a domestic product on sunday night. It didn&#039;t get processed for 3 days and I sent 2 messages asking whether it would be sent out and then if I could change the details of the order.<br />Late tonight I get a message from the vendor saying he took on some partner who he said he had to get with of because he was untrustworthy. The guy had kept all the addresses on a spreadsheet. No word yet if the information is destroyed. Also the listing I ordered from had a PGP code which I noticed it different from the current pgp on the vendors webpage suggesting that this other guy still has my address on record.<br /><br />Basically his messages were saying &quot;please tell mewhat did this guy say to you, he deleted all the messages he sent&quot;<br /><br />Its a very sensitive address because I have never had any issues whatsoever ordering domestic and it all seemed fine (also the amount was a small sampler). <br /><br />Now I&#039;m not sure what I should do in this situation. I&#039;ll wait until I get another reply from the real vendor. This guy has perfect ratings except for one where he is accused of not replying for weeks (so it could have been other guy causing some problems).<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty pissed off at the situation and am considering lodging a complaint to SR staff.

				Well the guy replied and said the untrustworthy guy won&#039;t have any details and that he doesn&#039;t know how to use PGP. That&#039;s all he said and cancelled the order and is no longer offering that product.<br /><br />I would have excepted something like an offer of a free reship of the sample if it becomes available again, or some offer of a little extra on a new order I would do from him..<br /><br />Taking on someone who fucks up your service and means I have bitcoins not available to me while I&#039;m wasting time expecting this product puts me off the domestic service which I haven&#039;t had any problems with before (or at least the vendor makes some effort to rectify the situation)

You could call a buyers mother a dirty whore who sucks cocks on sunday, but if you offer them free drugs, all is forgiven. <br /><br />You should take your address and run far far away.

				Get out of a bad situation if you believe it is. You do not want to be ordering from someone that apparantly has untrustworthy lackys storing your information. I do not know if it is actually true, but, if you believe you security to be paramount to your well being then do what you think is right.

				what make you think most selllers arent saving addresses? look at it this way if you went back and changed your feedback to extort them then they would want some insurance no? maybe with the perma feedback rules in place this isnt so much a problem but if a buyer gives you shit on the forums or wherever then the vendors will share nfo with eachother so you cant use another account to fuck them

Tracking numbers is what needs to be saved. Then if a buyer extorts you, you make them verify their zip, locate the tracking # associated with the zip and presto. Even then, you cannot tell what the address of the destination is as long as you didn&#039;t save the address originally. If a vendor is known to save addresses they get banned. So, if you are certain that is the case, report the vendor that you are suspecting.
