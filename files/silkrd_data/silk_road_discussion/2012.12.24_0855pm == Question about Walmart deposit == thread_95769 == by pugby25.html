				So recently I used Bitinstant&#039;s new service where you can deposit cash directly to a Walmart/CVS. Instead of sending the money to an E wallet however,<br />I sent it directly to my SR address. Its been over 2 days, and my bitcoins still haven&#039;t show up on my SR account, so i think I messed up along the way somewhere.<br />Do you guys know if its absolutely necessary to first deposit money to a wallet, then transfer the coins to your SR address. Or can you deposit directly from Walmart<br />to the SR and im just being an impatient and paranoid fuck???

No, it can, but usually doesn&#039;t take this long for the coins to arrive. You need to look up the transaction id on blockchain, and depending on what you find either contact SR support or Bitinstant about the delay.

				Alright thanks alot. I have looked up the id on block chain and it does say the transaction was completed. <br />Im in the process of talking to bitinstant support now but they are of little help. I will contact SR support soon,<br />thanks again for being supportive.

				OK,&nbsp; since the transaction showed up as completed, with I&#039;m sure a good number of confirmations, you&#039;ll want to contact SR support as soon as you can to get the process started. My coins have always gotten through without issue, but I&#039;ve read where people&#039;s coins haven&#039;t showed up in their SR wallet after a few days, and by contacting SR support they&#039;ll look into it and fix the issue. It can just take a few days depending on backlog.<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely annoying to have to wait for your coins this long, but you can at least put the panic button back in its drawer. :)

				Just make sure when you type the fake info, that fake info has to be the same info you put on the MoneyGram slip, otherwise its gonna say transaction fail at Walmart.<br /><br />So match the Fake Info. No Id required btw.
