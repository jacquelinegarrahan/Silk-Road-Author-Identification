				Wow this has been a perfect storm for me. Tried to get bitcoins through bitinstant on saturday and after contacting their support my coins finally hit my instawallet this morning. Then I send the coins to my sr account and now I have to wait for them to show up once again. Heres to hoping that the coins show up sometime today.

				I was definitely a little worried myself until I started seeing that it&#039;s affecting so many others, but this update made my evening and now the whole thing was fortunately no big deal.&nbsp; Never thought of it as the end of the road myself, I was more worried it might have been a mistake which resulted in some people losing out.&nbsp; I can accept taking risks when it comes to ordering and having things shipped, but if my money ever gets permanently lost somehow on its way to SR then I don&#039;t think I could bear having to worry about that every time also.&nbsp; At that point street buying and using other services would become the more desirable option for my needs.
