				I&#039;ve found far too many people leaving 5 out of 5 and finalizing early. Do people not realize that this skews the ratings? Yesterday I saw someone who had left 5 out of 5 despite saying that the quality was shit. <br />RATINGS SHOULD BE USED, AS WELL AS RESPECTED.<br />1 star for non-delivery and extremely bad customer service.<br />2 stars for delivery but very bad product (ie that doesn&#039;t do what it&#039;s supposed to do). <br />3 stars for an okay but generally disappointing (vis a vis the description) product.<br />4 stars for a good-very good product but perhaps lacking customer service, proper packing etc.<br />5 stars brilliant product and service all round.<br />Do forum members agree with my ratings? Please everyone can we all be a bit more discriminate with our ratings. After all, bad or moderate ratings make vendors improve and good ratings ensure that everything is as it should be. By the way, I also think the forum should be used for reviews etc.<br /><br />On a slightly different note, silk road says they will &#039;resolve&#039; a dispute if the &#039;condition&#039; is not good enough, what does &#039;condition&#039; mean because it&#039;s quite ambiguous. Does it mean, or include, the quality of the product? I assume they&#039;re not just talking about the quality of the packaging. I&#039;m a bit confused.<br />

				I think you might be under estimating the amount of transactions that go perfectly.&nbsp; I have done 19 transactions and I have left a 5 on all of them because the product has arrived in a reasonable time, the communication was adequate, the product is what i expected (often times better!), and never had an issue with packaging.<br /><br />I believe that if you receive your product in a fair time and it is in good shape with acceptable quality, you should leave a 5.&nbsp; All of my 19 transactions have been fine.&nbsp; I have yet to find a vendor to upset me.&nbsp; I think a lot of that has to do with doing my research before so I know what to expect.<br /><br />I don&#039;t FE and if I ever had an issue with a purchase I would go to the vendor before I left a bad rating.&nbsp; If we couldn&#039;t come to an agreement I would change my feedback to reflect the transaction.

				With somewhere north of 50 transactions I&#039;ve found if you stick with reputable and veteran vendors you always get consistent high quality and good delivery times. The vendors still here for ~8+months are here to stay and have this down to a science and you can always expect quality service from them.

But also, doing repeat business with some vendors is one way to get above average service.

People have to start using the feedback system the way it have to be, when a seller is unprofessional like this he is not supposed to be at 98 good feedback rating, people give 5/5 just because they receive their drugs in the mail..

				not going to get into the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of the rating system listed by the poster but I will say this, if you have or had a problem with an order you NEED to contact the vendor BEFORE leaving feedback. Buyers who leave bad feedback without contacting the vendor will undoubtedly end up on the bad buyer list on the vendor forum.<br />I had a buyer contact me about a problem, something I couldn&#039;t fix at the time but I agreed I made a mistake and I agreed I deserved the 4/5 he left me. We make mistakes and if we really care about our business we will do all we can to fix it... with that said there are A LOT of scam buyers out there... you know who you are!!! and we are tracking you, so STOP IT!!<br /><br />Thanks!<br />TJ

				If it is a new vendor and everything but the packaging was okay, I leave them a 5. I then message them with what I think was the problem and give them a chance to fix it. If I see a vendor who has been around for a while with good product, but he has complaints about his packaging, I won&#039;t ever order from him. Why ask for trouble.

				Have you ever thought maybe the reason why everyone&#039;s leaving 5/5, is because we&#039;re all really happy with our orders!<br />Maybe Silk Road really does have lot&#039;s of excellent vendor&#039;s and some well informed and picky customers.<br />On the other hand, FE should not be happening as much as it is.

				This debate is almost as old as the internet. 1 to 5 scales don&#039;t really work when you&#039;re rating something subjectively, you&#039;ll 5 it when it&#039;s acceptable and 1 it when it&#039;s not your taste. And there&#039;s the sympathy part: many people just like to be nice. Or are scared for any kind of retaliation. A vendor can usually cause more harm to a buyer (reputation wise) than vice versa, judging from what I&#039;ve seen so far. Some vendors even threaten to report/blacklist you if you leave any rating below 5/5 without a very, VERY urgent reason.<br /><br />Given that, what&#039;s left of your definition of that scale? You&#039;re trying to make it objective, but there&#039;s no such thing when it comes to rating something. There are too many factors.<br /><br />Leave it be.

				The clearnet keeps calling this place the amazon of Drugs :D<br /><br />We should have a rating system similar to the one amazon uses. 1-4 or 5 stars in different categories.<br /><br />Customer Service<br />Packaging<br />Shipping time<br />Product Quality<br /><br />Just a thought.

				I find that people consistently overate dealers. What&#039;s wrong with giving a 3 or 4 if the service or quality was just OK and nothing special? I think a 5 rating should denote something notable and well above average.<br /><br />And if anyone ever asks you to finalize early then give them a zero rating till the stuff arrives then change the feedback. If everyone did this for dealers who insist on FE it would soon put a stop to it.

And then after finely went to the forum and started a tread about the situation the vendor posted his name and address Limitless had the shut the thread down. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28278.0 after looking at the vendors profile page it looks like all his listings are gone.http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2cd7b36b76<br /><br />I would hope after pulling shit like that he would be gone. i would rather have someone try to extort me over feedback than dox me on an illegal site for purchasing drugs.
