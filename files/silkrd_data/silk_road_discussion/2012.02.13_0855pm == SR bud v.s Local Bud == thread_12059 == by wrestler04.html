				K I know this really depends on where you are but what do most of you think about the bud on SR and the bud you get locally? I get some pretty dank stuff but I figured that bud from california is way better than the bud I get here in MD. So I was wondering if you guys think its worth risking purchasing from here when I can get decent bud locally. But one thing thats really tempting about buying from SR are the variety of strains. I love trying different strains but Im sure that when I buy from my dealer its not actually the strain that he says it is. What do you guys think based on quality, The Bud on SR or the bud you get locally? Which is better?

				I was pretty sure that the SR bud I recently bought was the best bud I had ever come in contact with, and I have been buying locally for about a year or two from many different sources. With local small time dealers, you can be pretty sure (in my experience, at least) that the strain they says it is will most likely be made up but in someway related (e.g. &#039;grandaddy purp&#039; for a strain that had about 1 dot of purple per large bud).<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m sure its all about who you know locally and not where you are, but SR enables you to get good shit at good prices.

				The bud that I have purchased on Silk Road has been great. It&#039;s better than I can personally acquire in my home town. Not that comparable bud isn&#039;t available here - it most certainly is - but I prefer the convenience and safety of purchasing it online.<br /><br /><br />

				Locally, brick weed is just fading out the last couple of years. The &#039;nugget&#039; market is a mix of homegrown no name weed, rejected dispensary weed from other regions,etc. The weed I&#039;ve gotten from SR has on average been better. I&#039;m picky,most weed I will pick something I dont like about it, but there are a few guys on SR who distribute flawless weed. Not the strongest, or most potently grown necessarily, but the best grown/harvested,etc. I&#039;ve got some that wasnt flushed right,but thats a 90% chance locally.&nbsp; <br /><br />The best weed I&#039;ve ever had WAS mail-order weed,though he&#039;s not on SR.

				Nor cal is where you wanna be. I&#039;m never going to try sr bud cause we supply dat shit! Haha. The price of weed has gone down like crazy and the price here is pretty much how it used to be almost. Fuck that. Maybe when i get rich. I always rather have street dealers cause if you find a good person, oh man do you get some bomb shit for cheap. 25 a eighth for top quality AAAA. And obviously pills on the street and sometimes bomb coke for half the price or more if you find good people. If ppl just put time in looking and shit instead of being on the comp i think ppl would be happy with the ppl they find. Unfortuanatey I&#039;ve never had ppl like that for more than 2 months because they move around but all i care about is that i used that time wisely and got fucked up lol.<br /><br />Hail SR though! Now when I can&#039;t get cheap good product, I can get high quality shit for some decent prices. <br /><br />Now time to smoke some bomb #3 from psi. along with some bomb humboldt goodness.<br /><br />Peace and love<br /><br />PB

				I just got some of muskabuzz&#039;s &quot;Fleetwood&quot; OG Kush and I can honestly say it&#039;s some of the best bud I have ever smoked.<br /><br />The only thing that even compares locally is sold in ~2g $50 pieces that come vacuum sealed and labeled with the strain. I am almost positive that it all comes to this certain big city in the Northeast US direct from the Cali co-ops, hence the exorbitant prices. I know my weed, and this shit is always the strain it&#039;s claimed to be on the label. Since it&#039;s A++ bud, to say something is actually better means it&#039;s serious business lol.<br /><br />I actually picked up some of that local bud the other day and it ended up being &quot;regular&quot; OG Kush (as opposed to muskabuzz&#039;s proprietary strain). The shit gets me wrecked and the smell is amazing, but it&#039;s not quite as potent or well cured as the Fleetwood OG, which is also way cheaper. The dealers of the &quot;super high ends&quot; aren&#039;t exactly reliable either, so I think I&#039;m going to stick to SR and muskabuzz&#039;s straight fucking solar plasma weed. I just hope he has enough 3.5g pieces left to go around.. I want a zip of this stuff ASAP and need 2 more small orders from him to qualify.

				I used to live in a non-medical college town that was one the of the biggest party schools in the country at the time and the dank was overflowing. I know most of the stuff was being grown in the fertile regions of NC or locally, and the rest shipped from Col and Cal. Some of the beautiful medicine I found there actually is as good as silk roads best and was about the same prices. Most was just decent outdoor, but I was extremely fortunate to know some amazing friends who procured bud that absolutely blew my mind. I would say that is as good as it gets outside a med state though. In a medium sized southern city before that was really mostly only mids that could be found. Though I know from visits things have improved some and there is good bud around now.<br /><br />Hands down though some of the very best nugs I have ever had in years and years of daily smoking have definitely come from the Road. The prices are nearly equivalent esp before fees, and I am extremely grateful for the selection and wide variety of various types of medicine. At the best I would have three or four choices before, and now there is an entire crazy list of potential options with generally legit info about the product which I appreciate. My favorite vendor LexiSadie alone has had seven amazingly potent and delicious strains Ive tried, all of which have been incredible and among the best nugs I have ever been fortunate enough to try. Plus I generally walk from my safe address, so I like not having to drive with goods much anymore. Thats why the additional costs at times are certainly worth it.

Clean and strong highs are where it&#039;s at!<br /><br />I&#039;ll know for sure some day if SR bud is better than Nor cal F2F hookup&#039;s. Like BOMB OG Kush for 58 a quarter is amazing! 8)<br /><br />There might be some deals like that before fee&#039;s...but I&#039;m not looking for 58+fee&#039;s but 58$ and thats it lol.<br /><br />One day I&#039;ll know though cause the fire on here is fire FORSURE

				I sadly wasted a good chunk of coin on SR trying some of it&#039;s weeds.&nbsp; They are good quality for sure, but none of them got me any higher or were in any way better then any of the weed i&#039;ve smoked since I was a teenager. <br /><br />Perhaps it has to do with where you live, so for some it might be hard to say that&nbsp; SR weed is better or not, to some its the best shit they&#039;ve ever had, and to others ... they are still VERY FUCKING PISSED at wasting $160 on a 1/2oz of what I could have walked out my door and got the same quality weed for $80 lol.<br /><br />Only way to know is to try and know already if the area you live in actually has good weed in it to begin with.

				I have gotten some of the best bud I have ever tried on here. Much more variety than what I can find in my area, and prices are the same, if not better than street prices for me. Not to mention I have no access to hash in my area at all, so being able to get it is already a huge plus.

				It&#039;s 50-50 some bud I get on the streets is WAY better then half the green on SR and other times there&#039;s weed on here that blows you away (the more pricy stuff)<br /><br />when you first register though you don&#039;t really know, when I first joined I ordered 1g x 6 strains (from 6 different vendors), only 2/6 was better then what I get on the street.<br /><br />hash on the other hand...there&#039;s some hash on SR that&#039;s near impossible to find nowadays, i&#039;m talking about DutchShop&#039;s zero zero hash and SpanishFly&#039;s pakistani vanilla, both of insane quality compared to street stuff..

				Street bud around here is pretty varied. You never know what you&#039;re going to get, and the prices are pretty high 100-120q. Sometimes it will knock your fucking socks off, and sometimes you&#039;ll come out of it disappointed. Variety is minimal, definitely not many strains, but I&#039;ve had some killer no-name in the past. As someone else mentioned, hash, or at least good hash around my area is non-existent. People just smoke greens. I&#039;m able to do my own BHO runs, but aside from that, no one around here appreciates good concentrates. With that said, I&#039;d rather purchase from SR because I know what I&#039;m going to get everytime by looking at pictures, and generally at the same prices or sometimes even cheaper if you can believe it. The downside is the wait, but I&#039;d rather wait for some bomb than splurge on some decent.

				It really depends on where you live and who you know.&nbsp; When I lived in Cali, I know two growers, and had a card. The quality was impeccable, and the selection was really unbelievable. You could smoke a different strain of medical grade bud everyday and still not smoke them all.<br /><br />Now that I live here, I can get dro, but it isn&#039;t spectacular, and is rather overpriced. SR beats anything I can&#039;t get my hands on where I am.

				I&#039;d say the stuff on SR is probably better. When I was in London, I could get nice stuff, but the prices were pretty high. Now I&#039;m not in London, all I seem to be able to get is homegrown rubbish. £20 for 2.5 of wet stuff that smells kinda like chlorine? No thanks!<br />What I like about Silk Road is that the strains are what people say they are, and you get the weight they state. No wet stuff either, just nicely cured dry weed. The consistency and reliability are way above street level.

				Odds are that any good Cali bud you get off here is going to be AT LEAST as good as the best shit you can find on the east coast commercially, only cheaper. I&#039;m not too sure about MD, but anything on silk road is likely going to be better than the bud in and around NJ.<br /><br />I can buy exotics in the Tri-State area, but most of the shit is grown by people who rush the process and produce harsh ass weed that wasn&#039;t flushed and may have been harvested early. It really seems like the local growers started switching to CFLs and fucked up. All their bud has been airy, stringy crap with tiny bitch stems that probably went herm and was pulled early. I&#039;m like, you want $400/oz for THIS??? FUCK THAT!! <br /><br />You can get actual Cali bud around the big cities, but it&#039;s just not worth it. $50 for 2g of vacuum sealed Sour Deez? No thank you. That&#039;s just absurd. Why not buy a 50 bag of fucking coke for that price LOL??? I just ordered 2g of bud off SR for under $30 and not only is it better quality, but it comes straight to my fucking door. I can literally buy a hundred pre-sealed 2g bags and immediately flip them for $60 a pop, just like the dude who sells the 2g 50 pieces around here. And as verbalkint said, you simply cannot find any concentrates around here unless you get lucky and have some ethnic connections or something. I have some serious connects, but all I can get regularly is hash, and only around summertime at that.

And I&#039;m fucked up most of time so If i can get good connect anyone else can(especially on west coast),but if I lived on east coast It would probably take longer to find good priced fire but I&#039;m all about staying high while on earth so yeeeeee.

				I have bought weed from quite a few vendors on SR.&nbsp; Compared to the bud around here even the cheaper stuff is better then the &quot;goodie&quot; around here.&nbsp; Most people in my area just get some shit that looks good but doesn&#039;t really get you high.&nbsp; Most of the vendors on here are reputable some much more friendly than others!&nbsp; Hell sometimes that in itself is enough of a reason to stick around.

				I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s really cheaper it&#039;s maybe even more expensive but when you weigh up the odds your usually better paying top dollar for some decent bud from SR then your average no name street bud,<br /><br />I even purchased some cheap hash from Germany and it was the standard hash and that was even better than the street stuff so it&#039;s all good I think.

				Silk Road is definitely a much more better source of bud for me. All the dealers in my area either rip you off, give you some rock-hard compressed dirt for $20/gram claiming it&#039;s &quot;dank shit brah,&quot; are complete dimwitted douchebags that you would never want to associate with, or just scumbags that run away with your money if they get the chance. I&#039;m sure there are some honest dealers out there but SR is a much more better place for a grungy looking white male as myself.

				I haven&#039;t gotten to try anything from SR yet, but it sounds like people know what they&#039;re doing to say the least. Central FL is okay for weed. Plenty to go around of course, a decent amount of growers, but people don&#039;t usually seem to know what they&#039;re smoking. I know one guy that tells you the name of everything and they are all real names at least, but it all sort of looks the same to me.
