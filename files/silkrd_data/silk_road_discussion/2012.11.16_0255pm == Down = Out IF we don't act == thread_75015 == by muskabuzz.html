				I think we all should do a self review. I learned a lesson. Some of the behavior was uncalled for, but typical for the masses in panic mode.<br />Some of the things we did in mass, most certainly help delay the final solution. Was I the only one who felt that DPR warned me in public, shit was going down?<br />Have a backup plan, if you cut off your IRL sources. Some of you need to stay on your meds, and seeing that tomorrow&#039;s mail isn&#039;t going to deliver any really pisses you off. <br />Have a backup plan;)<br />Vendors, and buyers with funds tied up? Not sure what to do about that.<br />I think I&#039;ll start recording tor addresses, but do you think tor mail is all that safe? I know use PGP.

				Good opening post - the thing that concerns me is that if LE ever did start taking things down this place would collapse under itself. The paranoia on here reaches critical levels if everything is not running smoothly. A few points <br /><br />- I think DPR should be PGP signing all his important update posts<br />- There has to be something done about forum in terms of the spam and all the 1 post paranoia frenzy bullshitters<br />- Agree that vendors should have a plan B for secure communication if shit starts hitting the fan.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure exactly what you&#039;re saying (a lot of text and not much cohesion, plus why are you referring to yourself in third person?) but SR is not headed out the door. There hasn&#039;t been a shred of evidence to suggest otherwise. <br /><br />Myself and every other reasonably intelligent person made their plans. We gathered our vendors&#039; contact info, we learned where the SR community would be meeting if the forums went down, and we discussed other black market options.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not going to sit and reflect on how we acted as a community. Pointless. Our writings here had no impact on the downtime of the market, and everyone is free to act as batshit as they want. The freedoms are actually why I&#039;m so enamored with this place. ;)

				This is a quaint little thread you&#039;ve started, too bad it&#039;s BULLSH!T because Silk Road has ripped off many of it&#039;s most loyal patrons who deposited on the 9th and 10th and have proven all their transactions with still no money in accounts, DPR and his ADMIN team have done nothing new and the constant avalanche of bullshit about what was going on while they had other peoples money was a joke. I&#039;ve had 150 BTC stolen and I wonder to myself why the FUCK we have emergency release addresses saved if they don&#039;t use them when shit goes wrong or is looking to. Finally, I can&#039;t even get into my account 35hrs after replying to SR Support within ten minutes of their request with all relevant information. Not only have they not had the decency to reply, but they haven&#039;t even looked at it. Now, if it was 50 or 100 bucks I wouldn&#039;t care but $1700 is a different story. We, the buyers, pay the extra money on our goods to support this shitty excuse for a marketplace, the least we could do is be treated with the respect we&#039;ve earned as it is with vendors. Some of us have been here a long time and watched this place go from a Libertarian experiment in social consciousness, enlightenment and a form of non-violent protest to the war on drugs to a crack den of selfish pricks looking to make a buck and treating some of their most patient, and formerly most trusting, site customers like absolute shit while accommodating n00bs nobodies ever heard of. EVer since it&#039;s come back up there&#039;s vendors profiles active that simply shouldn&#039;t be (I know because some are my go to guys) and others you know just by broswing and making mental notes over time. I&#039;ve had vendors inbox me on here saying we all think this place has turned into a honeypot for the DEA, sort of what Facebook is to the CIA. People are kidding themselves if they think one man and his little team that can&#039;t even respond to messages about peoples money they have, process week old payments properly or keep out spambots on a Deepnet site, are able to match it with the NSA, MI-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 &amp; 9, DEA, FBI, Russian Spetznatz Cybercrime Division (they would be the most likely to take them out IMO), Interpol, the Australian Federal Police, Scotland Yard who all contributed to build the TOR network for themselves to use, not some junkie site, are fucking delusional! <br /><br />Does anyone wonder why China keeps out TOR? By controlling the exit nodes! All the Jew-SA Govt has to do is setup a bunch of really high bandwidth nodes then the TOR program will automatically funnel everything through the higher access server like it&#039;s supposed to, then you monitor the network and trace it back. People are honestly stupid to think if they built it they can&#039;t control it and if DPR was as good as his groupies like to think he would be on millions a year legit cracking into Chinese systems and exciting stuff like networking satellites and what not, not commissioning money from drug users.<br /><br />Think about it, I heard someone say &quot;we&#039;re the biggest drug market in the world bar none&quot; showing the sheer ignorance and stupidity of people on here who have no idea. The illicit drugs trade is 400Billion a year, second only to arms trading, and there&#039;s bigger drug markets in the golden triangle to South America.<br /><br />Imagine someone like DPR comparing themselves to Khun Sa (don&#039;t know who he is Google it) and furthermore it&#039;s clear the site was compromised BIG TIME, money&#039;s stolen and all the while we were told the opposite was the case. <br /><br />Whoever is pretending to be DPR now is doing a particularly poor job, they would at least try and imitate his writing style and character etc, instead they assume (correctly) that people will accept unencrypted statements of one sentence meaning nothing at all and show the pirate picture and everyone&#039;s cool with that as a progress report with contradictions everytime.<br /><br />I was optimistic, if only to get my coins back (which never happened anyway), but anyone who&#039;s been here long enough knows we ain&#039;t in Kansas (Pickard pun intended) and whoever&#039;s guiding the ship is going to lead everyone heavily involved to Worlds End by following the stars (probably the constellation LEO), the REAL DPR is still at Port Royal attached to an opium pipe in a harem while some hookers polishing his knob after selling the &quot;boat&quot; to another incompetent fool for probably more than it was worth and is laughing his arse off, he probably kept the system codes and then turned around and either cleaned out the wallets as I and others have had done or was the hacker extorting the site for more lol. <br /><br />Smart move IMO! <br /><br />It&#039;s most likely the government though... I laugh when people wonder why they let vendors in first to &quot;process (monitor) orders&quot; then they let buyers come in and deposit after having Bitinstant working with the FBI since around exactly the same time as the outage (coincidence?) and follow the yellow brick road. They wouldn&#039;t by law be allowed to let more keep joining and proliferating crime activity, but they are allowed to monitor and track already existing operations. This explains all the dodgy new vendors etc with stats they couldn&#039;t have achieved, old ones reappearing but they fucked up those vendors prices and people are wowed by the speed of it now, remember what I said about high speed nodes?<br /><br />I just want my money that&#039;s been stolen but since even by the SR Support etc, the strange n00b questions they asked when they shouldn&#039;t have had to along with no mods or DPR giving us State Of The Road Addresses or anything makes this place smell like Mum&#039;s cooking a pork roast!<br /><br />Finally, if you weren&#039;t intuitive enough to go through and get everyone&#039;s PGP&#039;s when you first became a member you have no forsight, and unless you can now verufy an alleged (especially new) vendor PGP you&#039;ll need to cross reference it to know they aren&#039;t LEO.<br /><br />You people are too relaxed and used to this that when it comes back half arsed and retardede you applaud. If this was named anything other than Silk Road, basically the brand, you would NOT have anywhere near the confidence in it based on it&#039;s competence and conduct lately.<br /><br />You get better service on fucking free porn sites FFS!<br /><br />WAKE UP PEOPLE I DON&#039;T WANT YOU ALL TO END UP IN PRISON, anyone who&#039;s been here for a while knows what&#039;s up that&#039;s why you here the real guys talking about REAL possibilities and then you have other dickheads going, &quot;it was probably just one of DPR&#039;s minions tripped over a power cord and pulled it out of the wall, it happens to all of us at times.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s exactly that kind of asinine mentality that will land that dickhead in prison! Who here has ever knocked a socket out of a wall and taken down a multimillion dollar business that&#039;s completely fucked everything causing over a week to fix and who would have &quot;minions&quot; that dumb???<br /><br />Exactly!!!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=75015.msg598760#msg598760">Quote from: muskabuzz on November 16, 2012, 02:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">in terms of significance we have now experienced SRs greatest outage. going forward the Muskabuzz wish to pose a question: <br /><br />what do you think we showed about ourselves during this period? <br /><br />the forums were open during most of the downtime giving everyone a chance to express themselves - potentially for the last time. with initially sparse updates an unusually sober paranoia immediately formed.&nbsp; there were frequent goodbyes - jaded as well as sincere and much whinging: lost orders, payments and opportunities for both buyer and seller. some immediately said their loss was foul play from those they trusted the day before. fortunately there were also plenty of old soldiers around, reminding us that the situation was not without precedent and that this was no time for fear.<br /><br />they were right of course, this was not the big one and we are all here to live on and learn from it but had this been the real end of Silk Road did we act the way we should have?<br /><br />if circumstance left us with a brief and final access to the forums would we know how to make proper use of them? it was striking: with limited time and so much critical information to exchange we were basically arguing amongst ourselves. even attempts at collecting contact information degraded into squabbles. <br /><br />having the great good fortune of working with so many of you the Muskabuzz know just what this community is capable of - changing the world of everyone in it. and we know that we are all certainly capable of much more than this.&nbsp; if one wants to argue or lament please save it for the refugee camp, not the field. identities and reputations are what will allow us to regroup. the communications tools of the forums are limited enough for exchanging this information safely; no one is aided by accusation nor complaint at this critical time. <br /><br />if there&#039;s a lesson that comes from disaster its a universal one: be prepared. whatever your security standards are there are backup communications available if we simply know where to find you.<br /><br />for our part the Muskabuzz is adding a tormail address to all correspondence<br /><br />muskabuzz@tormail.org<br /><br />for we intend to be here with you not just until the end but after, so that there never need be an end. this is neither our right nor privilege but rather our duty.<br /><br />for those that feel the same please use the comments to add your own backup contact information.<br /><br />thank you, we look forward to sharing a very long ride.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I&#039;ve had 150 BTC stolen and I wonder to myself why the FUCK we have emergency release addresses saved if they don&#039;t use them when shit goes wrong or is looking to. Finally, I can&#039;t even get into my account 35hrs after replying to SR Support within ten minutes of their request with all relevant information. Not only have they not had the decency to reply, but they haven&#039;t even looked at it. Now, if it was 50 or 100 bucks I wouldn&#039;t care but $1700 is a different story. We, the buyers, pay the extra money on our goods to support this shitty excuse for a marketplace, the least we could do is be treated with the respect we&#039;ve earned as it is with vendors. Some of us have been here a long time and watched this place go from a Libertarian experiment in social consciousness, enlightenment and a form of non-violent protest to the war on drugs to a crack den of selfish pricks looking to make a buck and treating some of their most patient, and formerly most trusting, site customers like absolute shit while accommodating n00bs nobodies ever heard of. EVer since it&#039;s come back up there&#039;s vendors profiles active that simply shouldn&#039;t be (I know because some are my go to guys) and others you know just by broswing and making mental notes over time. I&#039;ve had vendors inbox me on here saying we all think this place has turned into a honeypot for the DEA, sort of what Facebook is to the CIA. People are kidding themselves if they think one man and his little team that can&#039;t even respond to messages about peoples money they have, process week old payments properly or keep out spambots on a Deepnet site, are able to match it with the NSA, MI-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 &amp; 9, DEA, FBI, Russian Spetznatz Cybercrime Division (they would be the most likely to take them out IMO), Interpol, the Australian Federal Police, Scotland Yard who all contributed to build the TOR network for themselves to use, not some junkie site, are fucking delusional! <br /><br />Does anyone wonder why China keeps out TOR? By controlling the exit nodes! All the Jew-SA Govt has to do is setup a bunch of really high bandwidth nodes then the TOR program will automatically funnel everything through the higher access server like it&#039;s supposed to, then you monitor the network and trace it back.

				w/r/t:<br />your contact information: thank you - that is indeed the point here.<br />tormail safety: we recommend adding another layer of security such as pgp or at least a destruction service like privnote.<br />complaints and conspiracy theories: certainly there is a better place than here and now, we can however spare 3 words: quod erat demonstrandum<br />

				I&#039;d just like to remind folks that not everybody has their money. There is a contingent of folks who made deposits on 11/9 that have yet to see credit to their accounts. I for one am out about $160 USD. So I for one am not ready quite yet to start congratulating everybody on a job well done.

				kind thanks, confused souls, for the stream of limited consciousness. however it was unnecessary to prove the point so directly in this very thread. <br /><br />for those that can see the importance of helping each other defend the very splendid thing we have here, we applaud you; please use the comments to post your backup contact info.&nbsp;
