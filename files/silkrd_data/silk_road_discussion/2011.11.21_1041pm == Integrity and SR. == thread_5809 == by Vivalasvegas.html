				I always read the various posts on the forums and often PM certain members if I have a need to educate myself on a topic or a vendor experience and I thought that perhaps I would start a topic on who I feel has personal integrity in a historically shady and underground world of drug dealing. <br />This subject covers everything from forum members taking the time out to answer PM`s to delivering quality product.<br /><br /><br />I personally appreciate Freedome (UK) for his professionalism and Ivory (UK) for the same and quality of products ordered.<br />Also Richie Rich (RR), Mr Ribena, Priscilla Marie and Larson 72 for helping educate me.<br /><br />Nothing negative here just good people!

				<br />I&#039;m pleased to say that every single vendor purchase or simple communication that I have had with them, they have all gone above and beyond. Every one. I have had zero bad vibes or attitude, all were fun, considerate, and very professional. I have read crazy stuff on the forums of drama going down. Some vendors seem immature so I just do not deal with them not even once. So be choosey and be kind when you choose. I feel it is that simple. Also remember that this is the drug trade and not walmart. STILL I have had better service here than at walmart, lol. Just saying. This place is great. Just stay away from the shady sellers. Read the forums and educate yourself.

				All vendors were very helpful although I did not had many questions. <br />Its more the attitude that makes it nice. Often, as was said before, you are served better then in your local supermarket :-)<br />One not so nice experience though, want to buy mushrooms and that UK vendor kept trying that I pay before shipping or in moneypacks or something like that.<br />I have a good record 21,&nbsp; 0 refund 0 AF so why would he want that?<br />He was a bit strange though....talking about tribesman and kings and queens.&nbsp; <br />Talking how we have to serve the tribe?<br />I will order from another vendor to make sure all is really okay.&nbsp; <br />

				In my experience there&#039;s a lot of integrity going on here. All of the vendors I use + those I contacted have all (no exceptions!) delivered service with a smile - literally, lots of times I get smileys.&nbsp; The folks I buy from are polite, courteous &amp; knowledgeable. They ship like lightening &amp; answer messages almost as fast.&nbsp; They are good, solid&nbsp; businesspeople with good business sense.&nbsp; I applaud them, they are brave pioneers.<br /><br />I could list a 100 members here who have helped me out - doesn&#039;t seem fair to list only a few names but I am especially grateful to Nightcrawler for pgp4usb &amp; to astor for posting news from the other arenas that impact SR. <br /><br />Can&#039;t forget nomad for the reality checks and belly laughs + all the crazyass comedians &amp; lovable hugable gangsters who make me laugh so hard whenever I come here<br /><br />Last but certainly not least, there are ALL those hero members and the ones DPR calls the &quot;old hats&quot;.&nbsp; More pioneers *ting &amp; a toast* thank you all [insert hug]<br /><br />Cheers to all - Long live SR!<br /><br />Happy Christmas too&nbsp; :)

Your grammar and demeanor are similar and that is the only conclusion I could come to as to why you would hassle me without prior communication.

				if everyone quit doing FE it wouldn&#039;t be here.<br />i know this is simplistic especially for new vendors but we have <br />most all done it when we started. i have never asked anyone to <br />Fe except for one guy who was outside the continental U.S. and he turned out to be<br />a great customer - hiya Doc and Merry Christmas.
