				What is the proper way to handle this?<br />I received 60 light blue football shaped pills but with NO markings or scores anywhere. Everything I&#039;ve read said these would have to be fake. <br /><br />The money is still in escrow. The listing/ad aid they were Mylan, but Mylan brand have markings.

				Well you did get it so you have to think about how much the brand matters to you?&nbsp; Have you tried them?&nbsp; You should message the vendor and ask for a certain amount back and state your case.&nbsp; If he disagrees and you are certain the brand matters, you can dispute it.

				Its not anything to do with the brand, but 100% to do with no markings. In the US, all prescription pills must have some sort of marking on it.<br />Since they were loose, not in foil or bottle, I have no way of knowing.

				OK, here&#039;s what I think happened. You saw the price of xanax here, and saw that it&#039;s high as fuck. 13 bitcoins for 20 MG of xanax?! Then you keep scrolling, looking at the listings, and you see one that&#039;s surprisingly cheap. The seller is likely from India or China, or has connections to someone from there, and his profile page is in broken English. I bet the listing for the item didn&#039;t even have any pictures of the item. The person you bought from likely has under 50 feedback. <br /><br />The pills you got, even though have no marking, could be legit. Pills made from upcoming industrial powerhouse countries range from fake, to even more potent than the brand name ones. What I would do, is accept that I made a mistake not ordering from a well known vendor, and then finalize the order with honest feedback. I&#039;d leave a 4/5, saying that I got the product, but it didn&#039;t come as advertised, since the listing said it was a certain brand. On your feedback, be sure to say that the pills had no markings, as to warn other buyers. I would then try a couple of the pills, and if they get me fucked up, I&#039;d be happy I got a legit product. If they didn&#039;t, I&#039;d just flush them and chalk it up to a learning experience.

				I think I have received the same xanaxes as you, they were perfect as fuck. Did have to take a tab or two more than needed but it was very legit. So, either test it out or just attempt for a refund, up to you.

				try them before you claim fake. Counterfeit is not the same as fake and not having any markings but contain the chemical they are supposed to is counterfeit. So try them and if they work, give the man his money and rating. Dont be a baby because they dont have numbers and letters. If they are fake, meaning they dont work at all, then you have a legit bitch. have at it. <br />let us know how it goes. <br /><br />thormax

				I wouldn&#039;t dispute anything until you try it. If it&#039;s bunk, you can dispute the whole transaction. If not you can dispute it isn&#039;t advertised correctly.<br />To me there is a huge difference between those claims but the first thing to do it try them.

				I seems to me testing xanax is pretty easy, just take a few (depending on the strongness) wash them down with some beers and see what happens&nbsp; :o

				Seriously, just eat one or two.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like you have set a whole day aside to test some benzos unlike psychedelics.&nbsp; Eat em an hour or so before you go to sleep if need be, if they&#039;re legit, who cares about the goddam brand name and numbers?

				Here&#039;s what I would do: if they were sold as genuine Xanax and you&#039;ve got generic, you&#039;ve simply received the wrong product. I&#039;d take it up with the seller and see what happened. Maybe he made a mistake (he&#039;s selling genuine and generic and mixed up your order), maybe he&#039;s willing to take some of the price or maybe you can get a full return. In the end the seller made the mistake and I think you should figure out with him how to fix it, before using the escrow-service or the rating system.<br /><br />Now, I assume they&#039;re just generic. From my experience with prescription meds the generic is just as good as the real one. Xanax is just alprazolam + some binding agents to make it into a pill. However, if it is fake (not the real product) I&#039;d immediately use the escrow system to get a return (I&#039;m not sure if you can rate afterwards, but if you can, also leave a minimal rating). Sending fake pills is simply scamming.

				If they are pk&#039;s they are real (in terms of strength if not name). Take 2, you&#039;ll see.&nbsp; His V&#039;s were sub-par, but this discussion really belongs in the rumor mill.

				in my personal experience the generic or overseas Xanax is weaker / less potent than the US made stuff.&nbsp; You could try to take a couple and see what happens, but i would advise against this. I got some overseas opiates one time and they where advertised as hydrocodone, yet they had no effect on me other than a weird skin irritation/rash that caused the skin on my face to start melting off. so take caution with unmarked pills. overseas manufacturers arent held to the same standards as US produced pharmaceuticals, so who knows what you may be ingesting when you take unmarked pills from overseas.
