				The Muskabuzz recently offered a bounty for suggestions to eliminate spam in these forums.&nbsp; Yet as the ideas (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110439.msg952687#msg952687) and a poll (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110439.msg952687#msg952687)&nbsp; progressed something else happened: the forums dramatically cleaned up.&nbsp; <br /><br />The day we announced the bounty, as well as nearly every day someone posted in it, the SR discussion first page was dominated by spam. This is most certainly not the case today, nor any recent day.&nbsp; And instead of becoming a den of accusation and paranoia during the outage these forums were precisely what SR needed, regular updates and a vital means of communications between members.&nbsp; The calm wisdom prevailing within these boards not only made each of us prouder to be part of SR, it showed our foul attackers what we are made of. <br /><br />Whether or not anyone&#039;s specific suggestions were heeded one thing is very clear, the admins are working harder and its making a tremendous difference.&nbsp; We want to show thanks (and follow a suggestion by BlarghRawr) by awarding the bounty to the SR admins. And since they have not only suggested a solution, but also implemented it we are doubling the original bounty to a full 1 oz of Fleetwood&nbsp; (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ccd46e0fa5) to share amongst themselves.&nbsp; Enjoy. <br /><br />Of course there is a new problem now, we don&#039;t want to know the Admins&#039; shipping addresses and are quite sure they feel the same.&nbsp; Perhaps we could put our heads together again to solve this one too, any suggestions friends? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				After reading your reviews Muska, I&#039;m afraid you can&#039;t do this...<br /><br /><br />... See it looks like you have some fantastic weed and that would mean our lovely SR admins will smoke a bunch and then decide they need to sleep for a change&nbsp; :o<br /><br />We don&#039;t want anymore down time&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br />Lovely offer though mate, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll appreciate it! If you do find a way to do this, let me know! I&#039;ll happy chip in some MDMA for them&nbsp; :)

				I don&#039;t think there is any way of sending them without giving up their info....So I can take it on their behalf, thanks. Lol<br /><br />Nice gesture indeed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Only way I can think of is give them coins instead of their shares of the lovely buds, So that they can purchase or keep..Or maybe gift codes,...Not sure if those get reported back to the original creator with the name of the buyer who used them...

				When my constant nagging in DPR&#039;s ear to give the mods some admin privileges to delete the scammer/spammer accounts it became a million times easier to erase all their hard work in two clicks of the mouse.<br /><br />I&#039;m not after the reward by the way, shipping weed INTO Australia would be quite problematic, unfortunately.

You could then either send the BTC amount to me and I will distribute it, providing transaction IDs in the main thread as proof of sending, or I could send it from my own Bitcoin holdings and then you can then reimburse me.<br /><br />Let me know what you think! :)<br /><br />Libertas

				Libertas: btc is not out of the question, but we&#039;d rather have a stab at some answers first.&nbsp; Anonymity and liquidity of the bounty seem to go hand in hand so it&#039;s quite likely we could solve your dilemma of non-partaking with the same stroke. <br /><br />We do wish to take up your kind offer with distribution help, thank you.<br /><br />Should anyone come up with a solution for anonymous delivery to the admins we shall give them a share of the distribution which will be raised to an ounce and a half now. In the event of multiple collaborators the oldest (1st post) shall determine if additional shares should be issued.<br /><br />Thanks very much for your time,<br /><br /><br />Muskabuzz<br /><br />

I just personally do not see the point in holding a poll when you are not going to stick to it anyway or honor the agreement set forth when it was created. That to me is completely outrageous and if i were to ever do it my reputation would be completely tarnished. <br />I fully emplore them for providing the bounty in the first place and even more so i emplore the community we have here , It&#039;s one of the best i have ever seen if not the best on the web let alone the deepnet.<br /><br />The reason i was asking you was because you were a moderator and it would influence people, Seeing as it&#039;s a public market surely this would be beneficial. <br />Muska if you are reading this the fact that a mod wishes to withhold his statement as it would influence the decision doesn&#039;t look good. But thats not too say he agrees with me it could be the complete opposite. However i would ask you to honor our agreement even partially so i can get to try this bud i have wanted so badly to try for some time now and honor the agreement you made when you created the poll. If not then can you give me a reason other than &quot;it was widely ignored &quot;please. Because i dont recall anything stating how much interest their had to be in order for the bounty to be won. But i do remember 20 or 30 people involved so it seems substantial to me. <br /><br />I would expect this from a lower ranked vendor, But not a top rated one such as yourself. It really is disappointing. I hope you do not think i am some idiot just trying to get free bud, Of course i really want to try your product, But if it is as good as people are saying i would take Oz&#039;s regularly. And im here stating it now so you could hold me to this. It&#039;s more the point that you have decided not to stick to it and then suddenly start a new thread. Completely ignore the original poll and&nbsp; issue a new winner. Regardless of how much brilliant and outstanding work the admins have done. <br />I eagerly await your reply.<br />Thanks for your time <br />Hff

				That&#039;s a nice gesture, but it would be impossible to ship them weed. It could expose their location which I&#039;m sure LE would be interest in. Admins on Silk Road would be a target nearly as much as vendors I would say. They are the ones who allow the open forum discussion.<br /><br />Scout, Libertas &amp; SSBD all do a great job on here. Nearly every thread I read has at least one post by at least of of the mods. And free speech is promoted, with the exception of spam!<br />Thanks mods!

Either way, I think we&#039;re all very happy with the situation as it currently stands. :)<br /><br />Libertas
