				Hi,<br /><br />I confess to being a newb.... albeit one who has tried to read all the FAQs first. :P<br /><br />Twice now, I&#039;ve tried to order a small amount of psychedelics, and both times I got an automated message telling me the order had been cancelled by the seller.<br /><br />Why?&nbsp; I encrypted my mailing address using the seller&#039;s public key.&nbsp; And I had enough B$ in my account.&nbsp; Is there something I could be missing?<br /><br />In both cases, after the seller has cancelled the transaction, I am no longer able to find any of their items in the search results.&nbsp; Does that mean they have blocked me, somehow?&nbsp; Or have they just happened to withdraw all their items right as I tried to order them?<br /><br />Would appreciate some pointers.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to try ordering anything more until I have figured out what&#039;s going on.<br />Thanks in advance! :)

				It sounds like it could be 2 things:<br /><br />1)The seller doesn&#039;t want to sell to you because you are new (very common)<br /><br />2) The seller over sold a listing and canceled the over sold orders. then marked the listing to 0. Effectively delisting the item.<br /><br />No one is blocking you from seeing listings.<br /><br /><br />Good luck!

				Have you made transactions in the past and requested/received a refund? if so than that is shown and if you have bad statistics (lots of refunds) than no seller will work with you because it looks like you are a scammer.

				Have you considered mesg. the vendor and asking why your order was canceled? <br />I&#039;ve done that before and the vender told me why it was canceled.<br />Also did you go back to the vendor&#039;s profile and see if they updated their status.&nbsp;

It could be simply that you&#039;re too new so too much of a risk for the vendor, and may need to find someone else until you have some history built up to show your &#039;cred&#039;.

				Thanks, folks, for your replies.&nbsp; I am now trying to message prospective sellers beforehand, to ask whether they&#039;d be willing to sell a newb something.<br /><br />As for the sellers who cancelled orders: I can&#039;t seem to find their details any more, is there a way I can search for sellers by name?<br /><br />Lastly, is there a way I can view my own profile (feedback etc.)?<br /><br />Thanks again for your help! :D

				You can view your buyer stats by going to your account and clicking on &quot;Purchasing Stats&quot; on the right-hand side.&nbsp; If you have made no purchases though, this will be blank..<br /><br />As a buyer, you don&#039;t get &quot;feedback&quot; per se, just stats on auto-finalized purchases, refund percentage, amount of BTC spent, number of transactions.... You&#039;ll see by following the link.

				I understand you being new, and maybe that&#039;s it. Not having a lot of feedback or transactions. BUT...I know vendors can sometimes be leery too of someone buying a very small amount. I&#039;ve seen threads on here before questioning the authenticity of a buyer who orders something that&#039;s really small, so the price of shipping is more than or close to the cost of the item. Your best bet would be to contact the vendor first, and explain the situation to them. Most every single vendor on here is pretty helpful. At least the ones I&#039;ve dealt with are.

				It&#039;s possible that the orders were cancelled because the vendors were removed by SR for scamming or similar, especially if they can no longer be found :)

The vendor was kind of a dick too. At first he said I had to FE, so I said ok and hours later he cancelled my order. Well he went on vacation mode for a day or two, then when he was back I messaged him again to make sure everything was ok which he said it was. Day one my order is processing and the next day it&#039;s cancelled. Then I couldn&#039;t find any of his listings anywhere. Luckily I had a message from him still and clicked on his name. It said he was in &quot;stealth mode&quot;. When vendors are in stealth mode only their fans can see their listings. It&#039;s possible he went into stealth mode.

				Thanks folks for all the replies.&nbsp; I managed to find links to both the vendors in the end, and both of them had announcements about having run into issues recently... so maybe it wasn&#039;t me after all. :P&nbsp; However I&#039;ve also been messaging vendors in advance, checking whether they&#039;d be willing to sell to me.<br /><br />Thanks again for all your help!<br /><br />One final question, is a vendor expected to leave feedback for the buyer too on SR?<br /><br />Cheers.

I do not deal with people a 2nd time after they allow their purchase to auto-finalize with me. Making me wait 17 days when I hooked you up in 3. that pisses me off.<br /><br />1 question to YOU.

				I&#039;ll tell you why I would never sell to you again. You waited 6 DAYS after delivery to finalize my order. That&#039;s not cool to any Vendor and definately wasn&#039;t to me. It pisses Vendors off that they trust you and&nbsp; then you take your sweet time and finalize on your own schedule. Your name can get around Vendor circles VERY easy. Read the rules of the road. You finalize no more than 24 hours after delivery. That&#039;s just common sense. It&#039;s also a big possibility of where you live - Insider info.

				Message the seller. It at lets them know you&#039;re interested, maybe explain why you want to buy a small amount. The may agree to sell to you if you buy a quantity large enough to make it worth shipping. Establishing some sort of rapport before ordering is always a good idea. It&#039;s not like Amazon or Ebay, where an order shows up in their box and off they ship....<br /><br />I generally deal with opiates, but as you&#039;ve read on the forums: Don&#039;t FE! There are more than enough vendors on the road, one will sell to you without requiring FE. I found several, and I&#039;m a consistent, repeat customer. I&#039;ve only FE&#039;d once and, naturally, the transaction went south. So if you choose to FE, make sure it&#039;s money you&#039;re willing to lose.<br /><br />And as the other poster said, don&#039;t let your order auto-finalize. It&#039;s just plain wrong. Since I usually use the same vendors, I know the quality and can finalize the minute it&#039;s in the mailbox. For a new vendor, I try it, wait an hour or so, make sure it works, and finalize.
