				I actually was thinking about building the backup network on pigeons. The advantage is that they both provide communication (with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers protocol) and you can also use them to carry packages to the customers.<br /><br />We can probably also develop some &quot;pigeon mixer&quot; so that no pigeon ever knows both endpoints of its package.
