				Since the FDA let polymer get put into the new &quot;OP&quot; OC&#039;s imo illegally without testing, why in the fuck would ANYBODY who IV&#039;s spend stupid prices on these things when they were cheaper with the old formula? Not just IVers either. Seems if you IV make the jump and get some good #4 gear. I still like the Rox but jesus $40-50 per pill with my high tolly isn&#039;t a dilema at all.&nbsp; Just wondering is all. I like to keep some around for travel or emergencies. If you happened to live where gear was plenty could get old 80&#039;s for $30-45 easy, not anymore lol.

				I didn&#039;t know the &quot;gel&quot; was unapproved by the FDA. I used to take 3x30 and then 3x20 but the polymer (as you put it) secretes out of my eyeballs and I can&#039;t see shit so I had to step down and eventually quit taking them totally. I went down to 10mg and it was the same. I never had this issue with the old formula, strange eyeball glue. Good thing they &quot;fixed it for us&quot;. Oxy 15/ 30s and morphones just increased. Big ass waste of time and resources to glue my eyes shut.

				Actually they only &quot;changed&quot; it to keep the patent from going generic. Was nothing to do with abuse. The FDA DID approve it with NO testing. People who have been on them for years starting getting WD&#039;s from the same dose because the body couldn&#039;t break it down. So alot of doctors switched patients to something else as they saw the bigger problems happening.

It comes out in strings (convenient eh?) is the best way I can describe it.<br />I went to the eye doctor because I didn&#039;t put 2+2 together when it first started and they asked if I took any medications because some medicines can cause eye floaters I guess and I still didn&#039;t put 2+2 together.<br />I noticed one day I just took 1 20mg instead of the normal 3 and I had much less goo glue. The next day I took 4 as a test and I had much more goo glue. I did a series of tests to confirm and it appears that&#039;s what was going on.<br /><br />It would also come out in my mouth, upper gums and it was very much more than my eyes. It was pretty gross because it coated my mouth and when I woke up, I&#039;d have to jam a shirt in my gums to remove the &quot;strings&quot;. I was really disappointed because I battled the addiction phase for about a year and was able to get everything under control very well but now there&#039;s no good substitute for me. I don&#039;t want instant release, I want small amounts of pain relief for long periods of time to remain functional. I have been considering going to pain management and explaining the situation and heading into opana ER land for the slow release but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll be battling the addiction side again for about another year.<br /><br />The whole generic patent thing was presented to me by my pharmacist, but he didn&#039;t put it as bluntly as you did. They said they were having problems with orders and co-pays (name brand cost $$) because Purdue was going to make a change to retain control of the drug. Not so cool but not surprising at all. I am surprised about the FDA thing, I believe it but it sucks. This whole time I figured &quot;they must have tested this on thousands of people and I just happen to be one rare case.&quot; But now that I believe the story set-forth, there&#039;s probably a bunch of other people dealing with new side-effects, some probably haven&#039;t put 2+2 together yet either. Thanks Pharma.<br /><br />To add, when I take a new formula (OP) OC with diphenhydramine, the goo-content in my mouth and eyes at least doubles when I wake up. I&#039;m not sure how or why but it&#039;s very consistent in my personal testing.<br /><br />

				Be careful with the diphenhydramine!! I know this is going to sound like BS but it is 100% true.&nbsp; And I have reservations about saying anything at all because people will try anything with that whole&quot;Not gonna happen to me&quot; attitude.<br /><br />When I am on my MDone maintaining my all consuming disease. I take almost 100 diphenhydramine tablets a day. Almost died about a year ago from it. I go dose at the clinic and when I get in the car to leave I swallow 20-35 right then. 45 minutes later I can&#039;t tell you my name. It is the ultimate &quot;nod&quot; Its horrible but can&#039;t stop it. I have walked into walls,fell broke my wrist, started house fires, almost drank spider pesticide, pushed a wheel barrel around a mile away from my house, eaten cigerettes etc etc..........One night I felt weird and knew something was off. 2 minutes later i fell down stairs to the basement and went into unstoppable convulsions of all places for that it was my parents house. Enough of that I think I will post more in harm reduction. Its effects are and possibly deadly.<br /><br />Its all about the money. I keep telling people our goverment is the biggest drug cartel in the world. They let it come across borders and arrest us when we use it. Another thing I tell them is where and what do you thinks OC&#039;s and company are made and made from. Thats right poppy plants from same fields where heroin starts its process. Polymer in pills to me=heroin is prolly safer now in some parts or regions

I can&#039;t stand diphenhydramine though. It makes me feel like shit the day of and day after. I take a good amount of carisoprodol and do funny things but never pushed a wheelbarrow around. Taking 100 diphenhydramine tablets a day seems awful. I can&#039;t stand the feeling from 4 or 5 at once.
