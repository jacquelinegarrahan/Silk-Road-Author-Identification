				your SR account is in BTC, not USD. That is why i always spend the bitcoin i have because you never know what the exchange rate is going to be. you still have the same amount of btc, just the dollar value is less

				Unfortunately the BTC market has been extremely volatile recently and there are no measures in place to ensure the security of the buyers and vendors on SR. If you had a large quantity of BTC before the crash, you would have lost a lot of money.<br />

				Yeah if you have it set to $ then your account fluctuates.&nbsp; If you have it in BTC then the drug prices fluctuate.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad you have dreams of making $80,000 right out of school.&nbsp; I&#039;ll add my donation address to my signature soon:)
