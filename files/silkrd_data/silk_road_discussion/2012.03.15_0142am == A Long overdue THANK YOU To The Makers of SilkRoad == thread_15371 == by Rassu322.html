				SilkRoad is, in an essence, astounding, its like a beautiful manifestation of the will and desire of us the people, as a pose to the usual routine of the powers that be, telling us what we should want, or worse still, representing us falsely.<br /><br />To me it represents freedom.<br /><br />If you click on my profile, there is a thread I started telling a story about how I used SilkRoad to give weed to a recovering alcoholic with a lot of health problems, living on her own in solitude with no access to cannabis, and since this cannabis has helped her leaps and bounds both physically, mentally and sleep (with imo effects both mental and physical health) <br /><br />But apart from that, I was stuck in a shitty shitty situation<br /><br />A lot of people have great hookups in life, not just for basic stuff like weed but for all manner of drugs<br /><br />But for a LOT of people, the drug scene is shitty, not because of the substances, no no, but the people who control those in certain areas.<br /><br />I was in situation, where I would have to wait hours to hear back from a shitty dealer, who would sell me 1g of improperly dried bud (added fake weight, harsh smoke, lost potency potential) for Â£10, the worst part? it usually weighed 0.7/0.8g, now its easy to say, get a new dealer, but for a lot of people especially those who suffer even a little bit of social anxiety, or are scared the wrong people will find out (I believe everyone should be able to enjoy any substance they want privately if they so choose) <br /><br />SilkRoad has given me CHOICE, oh god, so much choice, it has given me access to drugs I could never have gotten (LSD etc. later down the line want to try DMT)<br /><br />And even if you could, there&#039;s no guarantee its going to be good or the real stuff, where as SilkRoad gives a platform for vendors to get ratings and reputations, as well as forums to keep open dialogues.<br /><br />I mean lets be honest here, the people who are smart and dedicated enough to get on SilkRoad (dedicated because it does require some investment and patience what with Bitcoins and the waiting, especially international) are the intellectual cream of the crop when it comes to drug users, well, I&#039;d say most of us are, this place is of course sadly riddled with scammers and such.<br /><br />I fucking love the fact that I&#039;ve smoked weed from almost every continent on earth except Asia and Antarctica<br /><br />I love that I can choose from the dankest of dank hydro medical AAA+ Cannabis, to naturally grown weed in long fields grown with nothing but the sun, and hell this is just the Cannabis<br /><br />It&#039;s also as a rule generally cheaper than in the streets.<br /><br />Just, thank you, the mainstream media and plenty of cynics would love to label this place as a bad twisted place, but you know what? most vendors here have shown me more respect, have thrown in more freebies etc. than ANY legit real life (i.e. ebay or small store w.e) vendors of any kind EVER have.<br /><br />I&#039;ve lost significant amounts of money to scammers (I do think SR Staff need to address this culture of Finalizing Early, maybe even make it mandatory and a rule not to make anybody with say 5 or more successful buys)<br />and I&#039;ve been screwed by the BTC fluctuations, I bet we all have.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve also gotten heavy orders on pretty much every order I&#039;ve ever made (weed), I&#039;ve been given half grams of budder free, grams of hashish free, free 2CB and a bunch of free valiums, and astounding deals compared to RL.

				Yep: 2 thumbs way up for the SR gurus. I so appreciate what appears to be ongoing attention to our security as well as attention to making the buying and ingestion of product one of high q!uality, if not, incredulity.<br /><br />I have been frequenting the security forums less of late because much of it is only partially comprehensible to me as a non-programmer/hacker/IT guy. But, I am so greatful that some of these guys like Kmfkewm are on our side. <br /><br />I am somewhat disturbed by the gun stuff on SR because those things are DESIGNED to allow the user to maim and kill things . I understand that to be a real egalitarian free market, devoid of subjective judgement about what is good/bad, a really free market should allow for buying virtually anything.&nbsp; I just with that a market for the guns would be completely separate. I guess the SR guys have done their level best to separate it as much as possible, so I know they are listening and trying to do the right thing vis-a-vis their customers. And, at least they stop at gun/ammo and don&#039;t allow for the sale of WMD or assassin offers.

				I have wanted a thread like this for a long time. I can not underexpress the beautiful and deep experiences I have had with the set up here. God, this forum will be the only way I can personally thank our respected vendors and creators, but god, the whole system is perfect for what we are looking for and hoping to achieve. Thank you to those are providing a new frontier. Deep in the akashic realms and deep within our freedom.

				Kudos to the Silk Road team. This is amazing, and I hope some day in the future this creation shall be accorded the same status as the first corporation or the first assembly line!<br /><br />Respect!!<br /><br />By the way, is there a way to figure out how well Silk Road is doing? For ex, calculating the number of transactions, percentage with satisfied customers, total bit coin exchange volume etc.? Has anyone defined something like Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Silk Road?<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;d also like to add that this place lets you CHOOSE weaker products if that&#039;s what you want. Not a luxury you can always make use of if buying street drugs (and definitely never the huge variety available from across all SR vendors)

				Like said above, SR has given me the freedom to choose not only from all the drugs and weapons I could ever want...but also the quality of the substances I want to purchase. The anonymity factor is perhaps the strongest feature of the Road.<br /><br />Over time, given that it doesn&#039;t get shut down somehow, it will become a haven for both drug user and vendor alike to find and sell the wares they want completely securely. At least almost completely.<br /><br />Thank you, creators of SR.<br /><br />

				This site started out good, but now I think its a limited hangout for LE. Why?<br /><br />1. Its gotten a lot of media. If TPTB didn&#039;t want a site like this around, you&#039;d have never heard of it.<br /><br />2. It has trolls that deny these kinds of things a little too much. Normal people would just take it into consideration, not accuse me of being &quot;paranoid&quot; ~&quot;Thou dost protest too much!&quot;<br /><br />3. Too many troll buyers and SR refuses to add buyer feedback to protect real vendors from LE buyers. Which makes sense because:<br /><br />4. Scammer buyers seem to be selective about who they scam...seems some vendors never get scam buyers ordering from them.<br /><br />BlackMarket Reloaded hasn&#039;t been around as long and has buyer feedback, what&#039;s the deal SR???<br /><br />

				Good Vibes Gentlemen! Men united are much stronger then divided!<br /><br />Back on topic, The Silk Road is bigger than if the moon landing had a bastard child with 9/11. Ok thats a little far, but it is the future. I am based in the IT industry and, like, this is genius. The site is not perfect, but the progress from this time last year to today, are you kidding me. The gentlemen who wrote this, If I were a betting man, played a part in shaping the future. <br /><br />THANK YOU! Whoever you are, the fruits of you labor will forever be winning in my book :)<br />&nbsp;:D
