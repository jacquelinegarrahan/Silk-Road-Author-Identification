				When looking at vendors, I like to see what people have to say about them. I like seeing if people were pleased with the stealth, if everything went smoothly, ect. Also, not being able to edit a feedback when you FE for someone does neither party any good!<br />Is there something that I am missing? Why can&#039;t we see feedback at the bottom of a vendor&#039;s profile? I&#039;ve clicked on the feedback bar graph box, and it looks like it should all be visible, but its just blank headings...<br />-tastylures

				Ya, I have not been able to find my customer&#039;s feedback on my vendor page either. Hopefully they will fix that with the current &quot;upgrade&quot; they are rolling out. I may just be missing a link to it? I&#039;ll try the widget after SR comes back online.

				Nice! It looks like they rolled out an update overnight! I can now see them all just as I expected by clicking on the widget. I think this whole process might actually streamline the site!

				hi hi<br /><br />yea. what a great update. EXCEPT the exact dollar amount and quantity is now listed on each and every feedback ---- for ALL vendors. how nice for law enforcement, ya know?&nbsp; maybe we should also order a whole bunch of doughnuts to the various DEA field offices too, since we&#039;re being so considerate for the cops......&nbsp; <br /><br />ugh.<br />i&#039;ve gone stealth mode until this gets sorted out, as it is the only way to hide that VERY sensitive information now... it&#039;s not even generalized! precise to the cent!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb
