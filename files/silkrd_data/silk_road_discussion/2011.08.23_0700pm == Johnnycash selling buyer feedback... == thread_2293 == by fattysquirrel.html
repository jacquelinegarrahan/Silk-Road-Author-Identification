				Well it certainly didn&#039;t take long for someone to try and screw the system, while at the same time profiting.<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/7269<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/2290<br /><br />He has these posted all over SR in different categories.&nbsp; I know this newly implemented system isn&#039;t perfect.&nbsp; A person could go and purchase a bunch of very low cost items/services to boost their buyer stats up.&nbsp; Making it look like they have had many successful transactions without any refunds or auto finalizes.&nbsp; Maybe the buyer stats should only track transactions that are over a certain value? 1 bitcoin, 2 maybe?&nbsp; possibly a USD value would be better since the bitcoin can fluctuate quite a bit at times.&nbsp; &nbsp;But something like Johnnycash is doing is just ridiculous.&nbsp; Seems ban worthy to me.<br /><br />Take care,<br />fattysquirrel

				Yup. Looks like we need more stats. May be BTC amount debited from buyer (not the actual amount, but something rounded to certain figures, for example &lt;1BTC, 1..5 BTC, 5..20 and so on)<br />That man of course will have his ban, but we still have some ebooks and site invites which new buyers (and even more possibly scammers) will use for the same thing: to bump up their stats. Though may be it is all much less drammatic than it seems.

				Ban his account.&nbsp; Or make it a prohibited listing category and tell the seller if they list this they will be banned, to at least give a chance to wise up. At 10btc to set the thing up he will have to sell 40 of those just to break even.<br /><br />We need 0 tolerance on this one, ban if they get one warning or complete one sale of this product. - they will keep losing money and give up.&nbsp; Bullshit like this must not be tolerated.<br /><br />Good job bringing this to the forums right away.

				i knew there would be an uproar about my listings, but the only thing I want to say is that my listings are no different than the demonoid invites... porno pictures....secret recipes... keezy donations...and other nonsense items that are overlooked here. I was at least being honest about what I was selling... just stats...and I only would have sold 1 stat per user who had zero... just so they would have 1 in their history...seems to me like there is more outrage about selling a simple stat than selling weapons that were supposedly not allowed from the begining!<br />

				one more note would be if Silk added &quot;last item purchased&quot; to buyer stats, then a listing like what I had could be used to scam &quot;would-be&quot; scammers, by exposing them as buying stats directly.<br /><br />the listings have been removed by silk, and I have no problem with that.

I just thought I should ask your thoughts, as you seem to be the authority on right and wrong on a drug forum. Scam buyers are always going to buy whatever cheap nonsense is available to get their stats.

				&quot;Keasy&quot; and johnnycash both took down those listings yesterday.<br />They are no longer an issue at the moment so let&#039;s try to not get to uptight about this.<br />They both took a chance that an approach might work in their favor and the community has spoken against both of their attempts. <br />So for at the moment I consider it a dead issue.<br />Nice try guys but the majority is gonna rule this type of community.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				I think he offered a pretty good solution with his &quot;last item purchased&quot; idea.&nbsp; Maybe it could just be &quot;Value of last item purchased&quot; or something like that.
