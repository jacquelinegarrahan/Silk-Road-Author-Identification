				It&#039;s great. I don&#039;t have to walk away and come back in 5 minutes to wait for the page to load. It&#039;s like being on the web or something. I love it.<br /><br />The forums, by contrast, slow as balls lately. I feel like all the speed of the forums has gone to the road. It&#039;s a fair trade.

				Exactly my experience on both counts... I think &#039;that which doesn&#039;t kill us&#039; has made SR much better and faster, and now the forums are undergoing similar upgrades and getting alternate addressing features.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that pretty soon both will be smokin&#039; fast.<br /><br />:)

				Yah it&#039;s lot faster consistently lately.<br /><br />I wonder how many more posts till we get a conspiracy theory about it being faster because LE took over? <br /><br />There&#039;s always a conspiracy theory when anything is different around here!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				I think what&#039;s more likely is that DPR just had a massive overhaul on security and put a fuckload of cash into upgrading his infrastructure.<br />
