				Nah just kidding lol, just realized I can finally give karma out so anyone can have some free karma if they wish!<br />This is particularly useful if you are a douche bag due to the high negative ratio you will have- so feel free to post here and get free positive karma even if you are a douche bag.<br />Lets face it guys, douche bags need karma too and it keeps the place entertaining when there are some real pissy fuckers lurking around boards just ready to represent the assholes perspective. Keeps things realistic too because alot of dick headery goes on IRL too.<br />To those who think offering free karma to douche bags is vilifying their narrow minded opinions, yes, you are correct but they say the first step to change is accepting and confessing to your vices. So i&#039;m hoping to see a few posts along the lines of:<br />&quot;I have finally built up the courage to admit I am a douche bag&quot; or<br />&quot;I have been a closet dick head for a number of years, but my shitty wit and assholiness is really starting to annoy me&quot;<br />But this is also for the good guys too! Have some karma on me, as I know first hand how difficult it can be being a good guy, eventually your goodness and al round empathetic heart starts to take its tole.<br />So hit me up guys- I will start out like a NA/CA/AA meeting.<br />&quot;Hey, i&#039;m Lifeis420 and im actually a comparatively good guy and as such want to help all the struggling douche bags with Karma. I realized my goodness was getting out of control after I began stealing to fund my charity donation addiction. At my worst I was donating over £50 a day to various good causes but thanks to the support from the group I have not donated to any charity for over one month! I intend to maintain this for as long as I can and im pleased to say that just for today, I can honestly say I have not given anything to any charity.&quot;

				I just noticed the paradox in this...<br />Even though i&#039;ve been clean from donating to good causes for over a month now, I am still compelled to give away financially worthless things.<br />But then again I think total abstinence based recovery is too extreme; dont tell the dope shooting junkie that he cant even have a spliff to chill the fuck out from the nasty WD&#039;s.<br />Update: Also, if you are so incredibly awesome and everything you say comes over as endearing I can also offer some negative karma on request to help with the bad ass image you crave. Hell I can give you as much as you like and you will appear controversial as fuck!<br />Just my way of giving back to the community that gets me high every day.<br />-Life

				Im getting the feeling that some of our fellow douche bags as well as the minority good guys are still holding back- just open up guys!<br />We are all in this together and everyone is welcome no matter how much of an asshole you are.<br />I know some people are reading this considering whether to post or not thinking &quot;I shou..Nah, im way to big an asshole. Im such a fucking dick head I am beyond help&quot; - thats the kind of negative thinking that makes you take out your personal insecurities on innocent good guys!!<br />Maybe once you feel the buzz of some positive karma you will see the world in a new light and can achieve some kind of douchbaggery/awesomeness balance.<br />Please share and at the end we issue &quot;Just for Today&quot; keyrings that you will probably never use as doing so is akin to telling everyone who see&#039;s your car keys &quot;Hey, I get fucked up on drink and drugs so often that me being straight for a day is such a rare occurance and so fucking difficult that I am worthy of a medal&quot;.<br />But they key ring goes further than that, not only does it show the world that you have serious personal issues but it also shows that you have far from gotten over those issues- you are still as fucked up as ever and just struggling through each day!!<br />Now thats awesome.
