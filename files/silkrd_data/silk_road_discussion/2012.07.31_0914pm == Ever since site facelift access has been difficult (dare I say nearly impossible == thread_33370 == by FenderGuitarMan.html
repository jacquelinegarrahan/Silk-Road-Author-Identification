				Hi, I&#039;ve seen threads talking about the site appearing to be down or slow... Ever since the day of the UI upgrade I can no longer log in reliably. It takes 4 or 5 tries to get in. When it fails it with the Problem loading page &quot;Unable to connect&quot;. Sometimes I connect and get to front page but attempts to navigate fail. Perhaps the UI upgrade changed the number of connections the server(s) can handle? I&#039;m having this problem both from a regular high speed cable model ISP and a network with more serious bandwidth, so I don&#039;t think the problem is on my end. At first I found this a minor annoyance but now it is limiting my ability to purchase or finalize!<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for either suggestions on a solution or others to chime in with similar experiences so the mods know this is a real problem. Thanks for listening!

				Yea we can just get a T3 line setup @ your house with 10 servers, and run SR from there.

				I am experiencing some weirdness as well. It says to log on again every time i click to reply on certain messages. First time the letters are missing from the capcha, the next time i can can successfully log on and get sent to home screen. The rest looks fine though. Haven&#039;t experienced this issue before. Same thing after rebooting.<br />Update: Now getting &quot;You do not have rights to access this resource&quot; message about every minute. I doubt this is a &quot;facelift issue&quot;.

Doubt when they put all that work into making the site more presentable they wanna hear that shit. I do have to agree tho that connecting was a bit of a bitch today but it seems all right now. Maybe it has something to do with traffic I got no idea.

				Slow access has nothing to do with the sites physical size, which if you bothered to read DPR&#039;s thread about the redesign he stated quite clearly that the size is only slightly larger and should not affect performance. The reason its slow as you can tell from teh rize in BTC is more people are using it and their infrastructure cant handle it well. That or you keep getting connected to some shit relays.

				masterblaster I did read DRP&#039;s thread. I am not necessarily asserting that the UI upgrade is the cause of the bad connections. I can say that almost since posting that message my ability to log on has increased. So I am having less difficulty. I don&#039;t have a long history with tor or SR, but access it enough to know that something was off whether server side or network. I can totally buy that more people are using it and as we all know any single server or small cluster has some finite number of supported connections. <br /><br />Also FTR, I don&#039;t necessarily feel the upgrade was a bad idea. I do question the need, but the look is certainly better and there a few functionality improvements that do make the flow through the system more productive. If my pet monkey were a professional in the web industry he might challenge the assertion that the UI upgrade would only have a tiny impact on the server if one were to do simple math on the number of bits flowing through the system for the old text-ish yahoo-ish style interface to the new fancy smancy one. But let&#039;s just say my monkey agrees that it is not likely responsible for a dramatic difference in number of supported connections but would change certain dynamics of the network traffic consumption. My point to the monkey was simply that there appeared to be a correlation between the day of the upgrade and the difficulty in access. The monkey just wants a banana.<br /><br />My main intention of the OP was to see if others had the same problem. I&#039;ve seen the problem where the captcha screen had numbers only and was missing letters, but only once or twice since the upgrade and once or twice before. So that is a push. Also one seller I deal with has claimed an inability to log in as his reason for being behind on orders. So apparently I am not alone!
