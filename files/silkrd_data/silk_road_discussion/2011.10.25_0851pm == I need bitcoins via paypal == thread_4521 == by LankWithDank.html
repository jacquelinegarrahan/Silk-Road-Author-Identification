				This is really a dangerous avenue to pursue, man.&nbsp; I mean, way too much info can be obtained doing this, since u both will know what/where it is for.&nbsp; If you use get-bitcoin.com, thru the cash deposit, nobody asks for any i.d.&nbsp; Not the bank, not get-btc...while paypal you are revealing a lot.&nbsp; Age doesn&#039;t have anything to do with it...I&#039;m not trying to discourage you, just sayin&#039;&nbsp; There&#039;s usually btc for sale on paypal anyway, and many have bought them, in a pinch, but they cost a lot more than the going rate...but that&#039;s supply and demand for you...using paypal with somebody u&#039;ve met on here is sure giving a whole lot of *traceable* info out...<br /><br />If I absolutely *had* to use Paypal, I&#039;d rather buy from some stranger with a good feedback than somebody from SR who could be &#039;u know who&#039;...

				btc for paypal is dangerous.<br /><br />First off you&#039;re putting all your info out there for the seller to see.&nbsp; So if you do it here, you could be opening yourself up to major problems.<br /><br />IF you have no other choice, do it via another site...put them through a tumble or two and then use them here would be my suggestion.

				Try virwox.com.&nbsp; You can deposit with PayPal, buy Linden$ (SecondLife currency), then use the Linden$ to buy BTC.<br /><br />There is a daily limit for PayPal transactions, $60/day initially then $85 a few days later.&nbsp; It&#039;ll take you a few days to get 30BTC but it&#039;s the only 100% safe way I know of given your situation.<br /><br />You _may_ have to download the SecondLife client, log in and find a VirWox station to verify your virwox account. Not sure if this is required to get BTC.<br /><br />Also note that&nbsp; you will lose a little bit of money at every step.&nbsp; PayPal will charge you a fee and VirWox will charge you two: once when you go $-&gt;Linden$ and again when you go Linden$-&gt;BTC.<br /><br />Hope that helps!

				Virwox Only allows you to buy/sell even numbers. Get-bitcoin.com cash deposit is easier and likely cheaper (5% fee). http://exchangezone.com just started offering BTC but there aren&#039;t many people buying/selling them since they fluctuate so much. It may be worth a try however.

				to use get-bitcoin.com all u really need is an email addy.&nbsp; no other info is really needed, and no i.d. either...not at bank to deposit cash, and certainly not online to do transaction...it&#039;s even better than exchangebitcoin was, since you don&#039;t need to join, either....friendly, too, with emails...<br /><br />
