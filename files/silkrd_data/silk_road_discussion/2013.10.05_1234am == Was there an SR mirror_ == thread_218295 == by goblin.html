				I posted this in another thread, but I think it&#039;s important enough to have one of its own to try to get an answer:<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t the SR main site have been mirrored entirely somewhere else physically? You&#039;d think that would be a no-brainer. And the mirror could have been updated with all the transactions from the database, if not on a daily basis, at least weekly.<br /><br />How hard would it be to install some kind of &quot;wake-up&quot; switch (either physical or software) that would make the site resurrect after a certain number of hours or days without contact from the main server?<br /><br />I realize I&#039;m talking here without the benefit of solid computer knowledge, but it seems to me this could have been doable. The only thing is that if the mirror wakes up and goes live, what would be the onion address of it? One of those that DPR published some time back?<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />goblin

				If they took the coins out of the market, even if we had a mirror, the coins would be gone....right/wrong?!

				Yes the escrow and account balances would be gone. everything else could be there. the btc are the loses for the risks and everything else go on like business as usual except people don keep $50k in SR wallet anymore?

				In theory the btc could be recovered.... even if the fbi have it, it does not mean tehy have every COPY of it, and then its a race to crack the encryption. If the wallet was encrypted and could not be brute forced (assuming DPR did not give up the password) it would have been backed up all over the place. He made mistakes but was not an idiot. If there was a full system backup, all we would need is the wallet password and the coins the FBI have would be useless. They could be useless regardless of any backup existing as it could take up to 2 billion years to crack a secure enough password.

				the money is gone. its not coming back, there is no magic switch, there is no savior. nothing.&nbsp; this was our Pearle harbor.&nbsp; <br /><br />maybe we wouldnt have such a huge deficit and a government shutdown if the government was taxing it. george washington grew hemp. franklin did dope. <br /><br />If the founding father were around today they would be labeled extremists and criminals. Shame on you LE!! You took an Oath! To protect the constitution. Not control us like sheep and a nanny state.
