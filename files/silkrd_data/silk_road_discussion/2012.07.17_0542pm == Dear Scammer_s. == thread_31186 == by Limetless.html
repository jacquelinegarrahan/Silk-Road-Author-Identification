				If you think that I am that much a pussy that I will fall for you silly little tricks of saying I supplied a product that didn&#039;t work then I will not fall for it then you are sadly mistaken.

				Basically the guy is saying that my JWH-018 was stamped with Caffeine which I know for certain it isn&#039;t. He bought 5g from me and wants a refund. I have already put him on the suspicious cunt thread in the vendor forum but this attempt to rip me off is so unbelievably blatant I decided to rip him apart on here publicly as well to punish them. <br /><br />I get really pissed when people insinuate/try to suggest I have bad/cut product because that is something that I make certain never happens. I take quality control very seriously so although yes, sometimes peoples order can get lost in transit (shit happens, we are shipping about is drugs, it&#039;s inevitable) when it leaves my hand it&#039;s never shit. <br /><br />Guy is called DigitalOrgasmica.....here is some bullshit to put on your roses (read from top downwards) - <br /><br />Dear Lim<br />It was with regret that I was forced to order my 018 from my previous supplier , as I had to spend well over 2 weeks smoking budget on street produce and low grade offerings from here , as I spent over my monthly budget for smoking on the order I made with you .<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sure it was just an honest mistake and are busy like myself and this matter may have slipped your attention , but I must request a refund A.S.A.P as my family finances can not afford to to lose this kind of money - the reason I switched to synthetics was my family&#039;s finances are very tight indeed and my on vice is cb1 and cb2 activation .<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sure you can understand I must put my family first ( my use of these substances is to treat adhd and depression , while my wife has ongoing back pain she must have relief from ) and being a man of integrity I don&#039;t doubt for a minute you will do the just thing here .<br /><br />Best wishes<br /><br />My response - <br /><br />I checked this out and I know that I definitely sent you JWH-018 and if you check my feedback for this product it has been spot on and nobody has complained about it, actually quite the reverse, they all commented on how high the quality was.<br /><br />Are you certain you use it correctly?<br /><br />Lim<br /><br />Their response - <br /><br />I am certain , it has some minute amount of the compound mixed with what I suspect may be caffeine ,<br />I&#039;M studding for my o chem degree and can therefore perform a chromatography analysis if It comes down to it ( although I put myself at risk by doing so ) .<br />But if that&#039;s what it takes to prove the product i received was cut to ribbons ( I&#039;m note saying by you ), but someone stamped HARD on this - it worthless to me .<br /><br />Taz<br /><br />My response - <br /><br />Now I know you are talking shit. It&#039;s in no way cut with caffeine as I get it tested.<br /><br />No dice prick, take your bullshit elsewhere.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Cunt must think I was born yesterday! <br /><br />To all you cunts out there that think this will work, it will not. &quot;I won&#039;t tire when I&#039;m on the wire&quot; PRICKS.

				LOL yeah, especially after this gem - <br /><br />I said I suspected it was caffeine not that it was , this whole transaction has been nothing but theft , why did it take you nearly 2 weeks to ship a product you had in stock with an extortionate next day delivery option ?<br /><br />Why is your 018 priced at around half that of your competitors , why are you ripping me of when I have been so patient .<br /><br />And then you lie to me saying you will ship 019 - rest assured I Will do my uptmost to make sure the community is aware you are a selective scam merchant , so you can&#039;t rip off other honest people .<br /><br />That is not a reprisal but a service I owe this community , thanks for making my familys month hell .<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how you sleep at night , karma is obviously no friend of yours .<br /><br />If you had it tested , witch I don&#039;t believe , why would you sell it so cheap and not post the purity results ?<br /><br />Any answers ?

				You know it is complete bullshit when they try to tug on your heart strings by saying their family is effected.<br /><br />If they&#039;re that heavily effected, don&#039;t be leaving your family go hungry on account of your drug habit...simple as! :)

				Yeah I know, I made it clear it didn&#039;t work by responding with this - <br /><br />Lol yeah it has worked out as theft, because YOU are a thieving cunt. Only thing is you haven&#039;t gotten away with it kid. Sucks to be you. <br /><br />Also I couldn&#039;t give a flying fuck about your family. If you can&#039;t feed them you should probably take them out to a field and shoot the cunts, will reduce the surplus population. <br /><br />Now here is what I suggest you do, end this conversation now and fuck off because we are done here. <br /><br />Tara! <br /><br />Says it all. :P
