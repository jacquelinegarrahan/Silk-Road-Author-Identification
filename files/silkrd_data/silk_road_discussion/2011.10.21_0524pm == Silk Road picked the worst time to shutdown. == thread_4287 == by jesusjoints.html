				Sent 100 BTC through which may now be lost.<br />(which is stuck in internet-limbo while the value decreases.)<br /><br />paid for half of 100 tabs to freedompeople <br />(which is caught in escrow while the value decreases.)<br /><br />Order from Walter in escrow still has not arrived and is going to auto-finalize in 3days<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Schizofreen&#039;s product did not come through and he promised me <br />a refund only a day or 2 before silkroad crashed.<br /><br />AND!!!&nbsp; i have an order with Dimitrispice i made before he <br />disappeared which he promised to refund before silkroad crashed.<br /><br />So as you can see i have a lot of money caught in limbo<br />and I&#039;m not quite sure what to do about it.<br /><br />I have hopes that silkroad will figure shit out and these issues will be fixed<br />but i honestly think this is the end of the road for silkroad (for me at least).<br /><br />(sorry if this came off as some bitchy rant... but this is so fucked up for me and many others.)

				Does SR use Freedom Hosting? Hopefully not because at least they&#039;ve been targeted by hysterical kids who want to cleanse the world from crime through denial of service attacks.

				Pretty sure this isn&#039;t SR&#039;s fault here from everything I&#039;ve read. <br />If it&#039;s any consolation though, I was able to briefly log into my account very early yesterday morning. I had sent some BTC to my account on an old address and I did see they did go through. Also noticed this morning the BTC are slowly starting to rise again in value.<br /><br />I have a feeling SR when it does come back up will make everything alright and everyone&#039;s Chi will fall back into place where it was before the outages.

				The timing of course was not &quot;picked&quot; by anyone here, I know its just a way of being frustrated at what happened.<br /><br />Everyone involved knows what went down with the timings of everything and I&#039;d expect there to be a high percentage of the SR population caught in a similar situations (myself included, but to a much lesser degree than you). If anyone is outraged at your delays (that were obviously well out of your control), they&#039;re insane anyway and you&#039;re better off not doing business with them to start with. The SR members with integrity will be working every angle to make sure we all recover from this in as fair a manner as possible. Anyone acting otherwise is showing their true colors and I&#039;d take it as a very red flag for any continued business.<br /><br />Lastly, if this is what it takes for it to be the end of the SR for you, that&#039;s probably for the best as what happened this week is just part of the nature of internet dealings. Sites come and go, are up and down and will always have a glitch in them somewhere. <br /><br />What will keep me here is the competence and integrity of SilkRoad the admin and the level of professionalism exhibited by the vendors I choose to interact with.<br />

				This was addressed in the original update thread, which is oddly gone now. But they saw the server crash the second time, i did to, because of impatient people trying to figure this out before the people that made the sight could get it working properly. They said they would do everything they could to fix the limbo-coin situation, and I&#039;m sure they will, not sure how, but these guys are a hell of a lot smarter than I am so I bet all these issues will be fixed. We just have to have patience. Go outside guys, smell some flowers, watch some birds, life is beautiful with or without the drugs we choose to ingest, so, like i&#039;ve said on several posts all over these forums, calm down and be patient. You aren&#039;t achieving anything by constantly worrying about your coin. Here&#039;s one of my favorite quote&#039;s that express this idea with the beautiful simplicity that only the Buddha could coin<br /><br />&quot;The secret of health for both mind and body <br />is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future,<br />or anticipate troubles, but to<br />LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WISELY AND EARNESTLY&quot;<br /><br />namaste

				Re: Torn&#039;s post<br /><br />I have not ever been on this forum but was directed over here when I could not log in the last couple of days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you Torn, well said my friend.&nbsp; You say &quot;internet sites come and go...&quot;&nbsp; and that is very true.&nbsp; I have been buying drugs off and on via the web for 8 years and frankly I must stand in SR&#039;s defense here as I have had great luck as a customer here and am 23/23 with purchase delivered.&nbsp; Believe me this is far above the industry norm.&nbsp; I have absolutely no reason to doubt that SR will be back if they it is in their power.&nbsp; For the most part this has been very well run.<br /><br />Granted, there are other means to buy drugs but to do one stop shopping and get top grade smoke from Lexi, speedy ephedrine pills in powderable form from ficus 2 or 3 hundred pills at a time,&nbsp; pretty decent cocaine (which is getting harder and harder to find that is not cut) and of course round my order out with a few roxis from the &quot;pharmsville&quot; boys is like putting a kid in a candy store.&nbsp; <br /><br />If SR is gone for good I a will be greatly saddened.&nbsp; I pray for them and the recovery of their site.&nbsp; Frankly, I am a kid in a candy store here and compared to other candy stores out there this is by far the best of the bunch!<br /><br />SR - keep up the good work, we are behind you 100% !!<br /><br />C.
