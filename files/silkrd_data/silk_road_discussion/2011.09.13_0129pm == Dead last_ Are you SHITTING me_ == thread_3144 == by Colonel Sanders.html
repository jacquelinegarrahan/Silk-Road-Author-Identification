				Goddamn, I hate to be complaining about something yet again after complaining about the new buyer feedback on cancelled orders (because I LOVE Silk Road), but this one is almost as bad and needs to be mentioned.<br /><br />I have a perfect 100 percent rating as a seller with about thirty feedbacks.&nbsp; Almost all my orders are from unique buyers as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m a small seller.&nbsp; I get a little in stock, I sell, and I&#039;m out for a week or two.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been off a bit longer than normal (three weeks), but my last feedback was only 2 weeks ago.<br /><br />I listed some more stock the other day and noticed it wasn&#039;t showing up in my category on the first page.&nbsp; So I check my profile page and guess what I find?<br /><br />I&#039;M DEAD FUCKING LAST.&nbsp; All 170-ish sellers or however, and I&#039;m dead fucking last.&nbsp; 100 percent rating, 30-ish sales, last feedback only a couple weeks ago, and that equates me to being shown as in last place, shown in the spot of what SHOULD BE the worst seller on Silk Road?<br /><br />Are you fucking kidding me?&nbsp; Does that seem pretty fucked up to anyone else?<br /><br />And I&#039;ve had a sale since then finalize so I am no longer dead last, but I am still retardedly low-ranked.<br /><br />This new ranking system is broken as fuck.&nbsp; Seriously.<br /><br />Smaller sellers, take note of my post.&nbsp; This is your future under the forward-weighted, backward-ass rating system.

				i have found that there are several vendors with the same rank... like there may be 10 dead last. its based on many factors, like login frequency, transactions, rating, time you have been a member.. and i am sure others too.<br /><br />just keep up the good work and you will go up quickly

				bro chillax, pop a benzo or something, everything is all cool. you just came back from vacation and it takes an hour or two for the system to refresh your status. same thing happened to me yesterday and it happens to all vendors after they come back from vacation <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:)

How about a nice full bar of Xanax? I can help you out there... <br /><br />But seriously, this happened to me when I went on vacation for a few days I came back and I was at the bottom. The algoritym soon corrected itself and put me back near the top where I have worked hard to belong!<br /><br />Don&#039;t lose hope, pop a benzo and slow the fuck down :)<br /><br />EnterTheMatrix

				Okay, so it&#039;s a bug with coming out of vacation mode.&nbsp; That makes me feel better.<br /><br />Still, that tells me the length of time till you get thrown into vacation mode needs to be lengthened, because I log in every few days even when I don&#039;t have product.&nbsp; When I have product listed, I log in at least once a day and usually multiple times because I always sell out fast.<br /><br />And I&#039;m not popping a blood vessel here whatever you guys think :P<br /><br />It&#039;s a big WTF moment when you&#039;ve been a good vendor with no black marks on your record and you look and it&#039;s showing you in the spot for the worst vendor on the site.

				Na, makes sense your reaction. If I came back and was like lets see the damage while I was away and I was dead last I would shit a brick. Deff would have to smoke a&nbsp; bowl. But luckily it&#039;s just a bug : ) <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

Smoke a fat bowl and eat yourself some benzo cereal; guys lets pour him a bowl of klonopin,xanax,valium,ativan, and liquid flunitrazepam :) <br /><br />Anyway, it does indeed take time to refresh.
