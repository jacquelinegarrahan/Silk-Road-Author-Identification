				money is money doesn&#039;t matter how big or tall the person is but the thing that caught me was you said older too so you must be a teen or something around there so yeah you are a major target watch yourself maybe look into packing some heat just in case

				Does this new customer have anything to do with the dude who threatened you? If you&#039;ve got a decent clientelle base I would lay low for a little bit, not take on new customers, especially if you get a shady feeling about them.

				Don&#039;t keep huge stacks of cash in the house maybe?<br /><br />Or invest in a safe?<br /><br />Seems like the more logical steps rather than buying a gun.

				Okay , so I should not deal with him on fb just by phone and semi public places to make some deals . It&#039;s unbelivable how easely 25i nbome sells i bought 250 @ .65$ each and sold 183 for 620$ in the last 3 days the profit opportunity is huge ! Also, I am thinking of moving into hash , less trouble with safety but way less profit margin. I did get a guy that told me his friend din&#039;t feel good at all after taking nbome&#039;s with alcohol. I told him not to take alcohol with these things.

At least create a new FB Profile with fakename?(Anonymously through tor) But even that wouldn&#039;t be a good idea. Maybe give him your tormail address?<br /><br />Don&#039;t use your parents home either. You don&#039;t know how trustworthy this guy is. If this guy makes any trouble the last thing you want is to get your parents involved. <br /><br />If you meet him outdoors, ask one or more friends to come with you, just in case something go wrong. Some Badass looking ones would be preferable. <br /><br />For your stash. Best to not keep it in your parents house. Is it possible for you to bury it somewhere nearby? (of course after you made sure nobody followed you or can spot what you are about to do)&nbsp; Just have the amount on yourself which you need to sell that day and leave the rest buried(in a mason jar to prevent moisture from destroying your tabs) <br /><br />Last but not least, trust your gut feeling! If you get a bad feeling as you approach the meeting, just leave. Better safe than sorry. Especially if you don&#039;t depend on the money from this guy.<br /><br />Stay safe!

				Passing on advice to be as safe as possible:<br /><br />As others have said - No FB, not ever!! Also use a no contract phone for all deals obv (am only suggesting this as you are thinking of using FB and your own address, so assuming you&#039;re very new to the game unless you&#039;re having a complete laugh at everyone lol). <br /><br />Never deal at your house!!! BUT do go somewhere on your terms.<br /><br />2nd - start small if you&#039;re taking on new customers and build trust. Don&#039;t brag and let ANYONE know how much you have. It&#039;s only gonna get you jacked regardless of how big you are.<br /><br />To answer your question I&#039;d say something along the lines of:<br /><br />&quot;A friend gave me a few blotters and am only selling small. I can do you max 5-10 to start for X amount..(since they so cheap anyways but depends on price)...If you like them, I&#039;ll see if can find more but no promises...&quot;<br /><br />If all ok, arrange a meet - If he likes them, he&#039;ll call u again regardless so wouldn&#039;t worry about having to big up your new business. Let your product speak...unless it&#039;s shit ;)<br /><br />Dont talk too much on phone or deals - talking too much, reveals too much and you&#039;ll only end up looking fresh. Personally imo, would advise you just to enjoy your stash with friends and not get involved in dealing so young - unless you have/need to. It&#039;s a mugs game and you gotta be smart. Trust me, you don;t wanna be responsible for anything that goes wrong, specially with newer chemicals to the market like nbome. imo, I&#039;d rather be shotting lsd as at least I know it&#039;s history and can advise on best way to take, plus no deaths from overdose etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Never accept new customers unless properly vouched for by friends and never carry amounts to a deal. <br /><br />If you know all this and are having a laugh then fine. If not - Just trying to give safe advise. Whatever you decide - good luck.

Hope it goes well<br /><br />Also, you could use a friend that holds the blotters whilst you take the cash for this new guy. Then signal to friend to bring over once received cash. Same way as it works on road...

				Ahh, the anxieties of dealing ...<br /><br />Just wanted to bring up some quick food for thought regarding firearms.&nbsp; Although we at the ILF believe that every soul has the right to self-defense, those of us who live in the USA have to consider the really draconian federal laws regarding so-called *possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime*.&nbsp; There&#039;s a five-year mandatory minimum for the first count, and for each additional count they hit you with 25.&nbsp; As in years, not 25I.&nbsp; It seems like the US Attorney has been known to have pretty broad ideas about what this offense constitutes and what the definition of furtherance is, as well.&nbsp; (The legislators went really crazy talking about use, carrying, possession, and the enhanced penalties for brandishing, discharging, etc. in 18 USC 924 if anybody is interested).<br /><br />OP&#039;s 25I isn&#039;t federally scheduled yet, and it doesn&#039;t sound like he&#039;s cruising for a federal case anyway, but we bring it up simply as a general point.<br /><br />The laws on this are, in our opinion, particularly outrageous and ridiculous, since once again, the amount of time they&#039;re talking about is devastating, and they punish possibilities rather than actual actions.

				DO NOT &quot;PACK HEAT.&quot; ...unless that heat consists of a few of your friends and their fists.<br /><br />Like has already been stated, not only will that massively increase your penalties if you get caught, but you also don&#039;t sound too experienced and I doubt you&#039;d be able to pull the trigger if the situation escalates. Although I guess the situation already HAS escalated if you feel the need to pull a gun.<br /><br />A friend and I were walking through New Orleans once at like 4:00 AM, and I went inside a store to get some cigs.&nbsp; When I came out, I noticed him near an alley, and when I walked up I saw a guy in the alley had a gun on him. The guy with the gun glanced my way for about two seconds and my friend did something I&#039;d probably never have the balls to do: He hit that mother in his face and proceeded to give him one of the worst beatings I&#039;ve witnessed.<br /><br />Moral of that little story: Pulling a gun will only piss someone off, and if that person is bigger/stronger/older then he&#039;ll probably just whoop your ass and STILL take all your drugs/money.

				Also, sniperguy, as a general rule, remember to think things through before you do anything, answering the what-ifs as best you can.&nbsp; But don&#039;t go crazy worrying too much about the what-ifs, because if you stress about all the possibilities that are almost impossible, you&#039;ll never take any action.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s a fine line to walk between paranoia and prudence.<br /><br />As far as 25I being passed off as acid, we would really hope OP is not doing this.&nbsp; It would be a real shame for someone to think she was getting LSD when she&#039;s getting something that just plain isn&#039;t that experience, especially considering that preliminary information indicates that there&#039;s a considerably greater likelihood that someone would react badly, and in rare and extreme cases, even fatally, to it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want to turn people off from acid before they&#039;ve even had it.

				That is true , I say it is 25i nbome and not acid. I stress that it is not as safe as acid too.

				You sound like a kid. You are committing a serious crime by selling this to minors and will go to prison for manslaughter if you are caught. You need to grow up, get a real job, you&#039;ll make more &quot;stach&quot; then from selling a small amount of huge riskl.

				If people you don&#039;t know at ALL are coming up to you asking you for drugs, or know anything that they shouldn&#039;t know, then you&#039;ve already failed. <br />The MOST important aspect of dealing is KEEP YOUR FUCKING MOUTH SHUT. Don&#039;t tell everyone you meet at a party, don&#039;t go around flashing your profits, just don&#039;t be stupid and keep your head low. You want to keep making money, don&#039;t you? Then lay low and do business the smart way. <br /><br />Don&#039;t text drug-dealing or buying related stuff on your phone, BUY A PREPAID phone for this and replace it every few months with a new one. It&#039;s pretty simple for the police to get a hold of some nice, juicy phone records, especially with smart phones. Also, I hope I don&#039;t have to mention that this rule applies even moreso to Facebook and other social networks. Believe it or not, facebook gets a raging hard-on for divulging information to LEO. They absolutely love that shit..So don&#039;t be an idiot.<br /><br />As far as storing your stash.. the worst place to keep it is in your house, in a drawer in your room or something. Always try to keep it away from your house, even buried in your neighbors yard is good enough. Try and find a nice place in the woods (or desert) and bury it a foot deep in a waterproof container, and make sure noone is watching you digging, obviously. <br />And noone can know about this stash, obviously. Don&#039;t go bragging to your friends that you have the coolest stash spot evar, guiz. A stash spot is meant to be a secret, don&#039;t go divulging its location.
