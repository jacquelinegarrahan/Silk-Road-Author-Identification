				I&#039;m having troubles connecting to SR as well. It may just be overloaded with users right now. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it at this point.

				It may have as much to do with Tor as it does with anything else . . . being a holiday for USA &amp; all,&nbsp; been getting real dumb questions from n00bs as well so may have a lot of congestion on Tor overall.&nbsp; &nbsp;Found that opening 5 or 6 tabs &amp; trying to load SR usually finally works!<br /><br />NCK

				Thanks for the replies, so can I get a confirmation off anyone that they are on SR ok? Trying to figure out if it is a problem with Tor in general, or just SR.

				Keep refreshing your identity by clicking the &#039;Use new identity&#039; button on the &#039;Vidalia Control Panel&#039; you may need to do this multiple times but you&#039;ll be&nbsp; connected eventually. I&#039;ve had connection problems all weekend, other .onions have also been down for me (like Tormail) so I think it&#039;s more of a Tor connectivity problem than a SilkRoad problem, hope Tor releases another &#039;security update&#039; soon as that normally speeds things up :)
