				Here&#039;s my slogan idea:<br /><br />Silk Road : The Best Illegal Drugz you can get from the InterWebz..........&nbsp; Before the multinational, facist LEO&#039;s Black - Ops come and take you away into the night..... Smoke, snort, inject, swallow, and plug (eww) &#039;em while you can!<br /><br />EDIT: here&#039;s another slogan:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Silk Road :&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;ve got camel mail!<br /><br /><br /><br />What&#039;s your new slogan for Silk Road like? Post em here if you want.

				I seriously think we need some advertisements for the Silk Road. Maybe a flash video which anthropomorphizes the Silk Road, or a metaphorical story of how it works using stock footage, and the link at the end. Reddit and /b/ would do the heavy lifting by distributing it far and wide.<br /><br />Idea 1: <br /><br />Footage of some newb using Amazon for the first time. We edit the footage so that the camera for a moment pans over &quot;People who bought X, also bought Cocaine, Weed and LSD!&quot;, the Amazon advert continues for a moment on, and then suddenly rewinds back with a jarring mock record rewind sound to the &#039;Recommended for you&#039; section the camera initially glossed over and sharpens/enhances it.<br /><br />Then we have the Beetlejuice juice soundtrack (it&#039;s zany) playing in the background over stock footage of a package going through the mail system from one machine to the next etc. Finally it arrives, and again, we have stock footage, everybody in the family is happy and dancing etc that they got their package (that&#039;s what normally happens when MDMA is delivered anyway), I&#039;m sure we can abuse a USPS or FedEx advert like this. We then blur out the dancing people, and the SR URL appears superimposed on the screen.<br /><br />Idea 2:<br /><br />Alternatively, you could use clips from dozens of popular movies and insert Silk Road references/URL. That would be cheap and easy. e.g. the ending of the first Matrix film would appropriate as an introduction, with Rage Against The Machine playing &quot;Wake Up&quot; in the background and the dramatically sideway sweeping credits placed with SR references/URL.<br /><br />It&#039;d also be great if we used a mnemonic so it was possible to remember the URL without memorizing it. Then you could do some sneaky shit in mainstream media...<br /><br />Also! It would be trivial to edit a few MasterCard advertisements. Cost of doing business: getting bitcoin, waiting for package etc, and then &#039;Getting drugs delivered in the post by USPS? : Priceless!&#039;<br />

				I heard a guy say this on here and I cant find the post.<br /><br />You know how your grandpa bitched that he had to walk 5 miles in the snow both ways ect. When im a granpa am I goign to be bitching at my grand kids &quot;I had download a special browser, anonomys, have a vacume bagged substance sent from another country while I shit my pants for 12 days. Are they gonna say that&#039;s stupid grandpa we just order form Amazon/Walmart and our it is delivered in 20 minutes. <br /><br />I wish I could give credit to the guy who wrote this as it was written alot better and funny as hell.<br /><br />But yea that would make an awsome video the grandpa lecturing the kids and it doing like pine said but its like a flashback him ordering it, going through processing at the mail , being shipped, shows the guy&nbsp; like geeking out paranoid checking the mail box looking around at like 2 am. Then when all the flash abck ends a knock at the door &quot;Delivery from walmart got you COCAINE!&quot;. Have like logos and some kind of saying how everyone says, how this is the future or this is the game changer ect.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Silk Road Anonymous Market<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(in creepy drug dealer voice)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It started here but it wont end here&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Idea 2 this one is all mine.<br /><br />Do something like have a gangster ass dude with gold teeth on the corner trying to sling. His buddy comes up and is like you dawg has ya doin on the benjis today. Dealer says &quot; Not good dawg I used ta be able to cut this shiz all day and the jits come running with them hanz out. What happened dawg? Dealer &quot;Some punk mutherfucka name The Silk Road came int twon and he runnin a legit biz motherfucker&#039;. Uncut good reviews all that shit, my babies be starving cause of this nigga, I say we put a cap in ass dawg.<br /><br /><br />Im not going to go to much more into detail on this but it would be funny as hell.<br /><br />Idea 3<br /><br />Or do some celebrities impersonations like have lady gaga fake in one of her retarted outfits sitting on a bicycle in her living room doing lines.<br />Talking about I dont need my assistant to score for me anymore silk road blah blah blah. Or Beiber and Selina ordering mdma and grinding and shit haha.<br /><br />Makes me wonder also if there are celebrities that order from this site. Its gotta be known in hollywood and shit. I imagine if your famous its not to easy to score&nbsp; heroin and coke or what not without it ending in the tabloids or if you get caught ect. I know it runs rampant in parties ect charlie sheen but shit there is gotta be someone like mandy moore banging lines try to keep it down low. <br /><br />Justin Beibers on this shit orderin MDMA for him and Selina(Sp).<br /><br />Now that I think of it these are maybe more comedy than actually getting a good intro or video but hey that my ideas.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />But yea I agree if crazy shit like these videos go down and they go viral, this place is gonna blow up with people then get blown the fuck up by the government.

				I like what Buster was talking about, the whole, &quot;When I was your age, I had to go through all this shit to get my drugs.&quot;&nbsp; Then showing a bunch of grandkids being all incredulous, &quot;That&#039;s stupid grandpa, why didn&#039;t you just go to the drug section at Walmart?&quot;&nbsp; I think ads that make people compare drug prohibition to things they already consider acceptable is a good direction.

				Yeah, you know it seems kinda funny that some people have this attitude towards Silk Road being &#039;too&quot; well known. Like its your favorite music band about to break big, and they might get too famous and mainstream soon. That kind of secret club, lets keep it to ourselves, and only let &quot;the cool kids&quot; in, heh.<br /><br />Boy, Silk Road is going to continue to spread word of mouth anyways at the very least so. Maybe it needs a costume accessory, like Anon&#039;s have their&nbsp; V masks?&nbsp; Green Bandanas, or green armbands maybe? Staffs, robes, and camel props for everyone! Camel masks!<br /><br />No, wait, keep it hidden, someone might find my drug stash. Shhh, keep it down, put on your tin foil hats, they are out there...... listening.........&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lol.

				I&#039;m not sure having waves of 4CHAN retards, and making it so easy your mom can do it is the best of ideas. Growth is good, but sustainable, and the right growth. It&#039;s great that its already almost too easy to access, that is a good thing and a bad thing. But there is still some trickery involved, and some basic computer knowledge needed. <br /><br />Honestly anyone who at this point cant figure out how to get on TOR/SR probably shouldn&#039;t be here for our own safety. Buyers are the most vulnerable but vendors aren&#039;t in the clear either. Taking a guess at how I know most vendors ship I could get pretty damn close pin on their address within a few weeks time. <br /><br />We need good word of mouth to people that are felt trust-able/not retarded/not rats. I&#039;m guessing 99% of the 4chan users would spill anything and everything they could possibly to LEO the second the LEO showed up at the door. Even if he was just there to ask them to move their car.<br /><br />IMO better to get the ball rolling and slowly then to hurl it down the hill and hope just because its going fast it makes it.<br /><br />I&#039;m just rambling at this point :/

				Silk Road will become mainstream acceptable over time the way marijuana is becoming.&nbsp; It is no longer confined to the dark image in your mind of a dirty man shooting weed in his vein in a back-alley. Now it&#039;s your friend, nephew, or even the friendly mailman.&nbsp; IMO word-of-mouth is the best way to keep SR functioning well with responsible growth unless you have shitty friends.

Deep shit.<br /><br />Hm let me try a serious one, ahem,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road: Let the drugs flow free, the way they were meant to be.<br /><br /><br />Of course by &#039;free&#039;, I mean more like a freedom from oppression thing, not price wise, heh. Cause let&#039;s face it, the drugs cost bit coin around here. lol.

				Well, I hope dread pirate roberts has read the thread and written down copious notes. <br /><br />Ahh... he&#039;s too busy working on the Slik Road site, and by working I mean he&#039;s doing rails off the plump back side of some high priced ukranian escort in&nbsp; a limo somewhere.<br /><br />But I hate to speak ill of DPR cause you will suddenly find all the drugs you ordered will be spiked with Iocane powder. It is orderless, tasteless, and.......you know the rest if you have ever seen the princess bride. <br /><br />lol.<br /><br /><br /><br />
