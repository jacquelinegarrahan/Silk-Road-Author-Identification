				I am seriously considering becoming a vendor, but have noticed there seems to be a fear of &quot;unproven&quot; vendors. So my question to you is, how do you establish credibility?<br /><br />I want to be known for having a good product, and handling business with the utmost professionalism. How do I go about that as a new vendor? Are there review services, that are trusted and will review your product for a wide audience?<br /><br />I would be selling cannabis, from the east coast (US). <br /><br />Any help is appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />-OysterCult

				Honestly.. sending samples to reputable buyers is the best way to gain quick credibility... just a gram of green to some established forum members and make them purchase from Market and have them show you stats so that you are not sending to noobs or someone who will not take the time to review your product.. This is the best way I have seen on the road, not trying to say this to get one myself, there are many more members who have been here much longer than myself, just a suggestion to your problem..

				When you start out as a vendor sell at discount prices, The lower the better.<br />Everyone loves a bargain. Then once you have become established as a good vendor set your prices to what ever you were planning.<br /><br />But be very clear that the prices are lowed due to the fact that your just stating up or people could wonder why the sudden increase.<br /><br />Samples are all ways a good idea too.

				Like you make a name for any business..<br /><br />Get people talking about you - low prices, free gifts, packaging that is sweet, high-quality product - Just get every part of the game down to a T and people will recognize you and your product.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Sending out samples is a sure way to start off. <br /><br />But here&#039;s the bets way to do it:<br /><br />Start a stealth link with the sample priced a minimum of .01BTC or whatever price you want. You can ship free or charge for shipping. <br />You limit the quantity to the number of samples you wish to send out. .01BTC is best of course but many are willing to pay shipping. Your call. <br /><br />Then you start a thread in the product offer section titled appropriately asking who would like to sample. <br />Pick established posters as their opinion carries a little more clout than a noob and they won&#039;t appear as shills.<br /><br />By making the stealth link for samples, when the recipient receives the sample , they will finalize and give feedback. When 5 of them do that, provided that they each give you 5/5, you&#039;ll have a 100% rating plus a review of your product on the forum. <br />

				it addition to what people have said about samples, a good forum presence, with you being active would help. i also highly recommend having good communication. one of the current best LSD vendors has only been on the road for around 2-3 months, but has amazing communication, true product, and does not require FE. good communication is key to being a good vendor. good luck, and hope you do well :)

				deff samples, also make sure to require DCN shipping on anyone with less then 15 feedback and what not, basically you need to try your best to avoid scammers because they are the ones who will shoot down your chance to become a reputable vendor. Other then that, ship in a timely manner and don&#039;t bite off more then you can chew. I noticed as a new vendor myself that plenty of people tried to order and say they never got it so i took a few hits until i required DCN for new buyers and most of the bad buyers went away, dont get me wrong there are a lot of new people on the road trying to establish there own buyer stats and not screw u over, but cover your own ass!

				I&#039;m looking for an East coast cannabis vendor just to have packages delivered from places other than CA so it&#039;s likely I would respond to a Rumor Mill post for your samples. <br /><br />Also, I have no problem being the first customer if you&#039;re using PGP and your profile page is written as well and as clearly as the OP.&nbsp; PM me if you get up and running ... cheers&nbsp; :-*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				If you aren&#039;t in a hurry, then just offer a quality product at a good price and eventually a few people will buy and provide feedback which will help convince others to buy.<br /><br />I do recommend only shipping things tracked or with delivery confirmation.&nbsp; As a new vendor you aren&#039;t allowed to require people to FE until you hit something like 30 transactions.&nbsp; Without proof of delivery it is the word of others vs your word.<br /><br />If you&#039;re unable to ship with proof of delivery then absolutely don&#039;t sell to anyone that isn&#039;t established with good stats.<br /><br />PS I&#039;m not actually experienced with this stuff so I might be full of shit.
