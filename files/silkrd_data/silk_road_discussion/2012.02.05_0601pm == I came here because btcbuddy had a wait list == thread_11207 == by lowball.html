				For small and few transactions... then MP are worth it. but i think you can only reload 1 or 2 cards per day... after a few days of doing that... they lock down your card! I don&#039;t know all the details maybe. maybe there is another way to cash them and turn them back in to cold hard cash. I&#039;d be more interested in them if there was a way. but i don&#039;t think so.
