				Seriously, all this gun/gawker drama is pissing me off. I&#039;m just trying to get some bud, but I can&#039;t because there&#039;s a shit storm that I don&#039;t care about brewing.<br />

				Oh you poor poor people! <br /><br />1. You are getting high quality marijuana delivered to your fucking door.<br />2. It&#039;s much safer than getting it on the street. (not to mention the quality is better and you get it overweight) <br />3. Oh the article is pissing you off is it? Don&#039;t buy a gun? You think they give a shit about you and your 1g of weed? <br />4. Instead of bitching about it on a forum go outside and get your own.<br /><br />Don&#039;t mean to rage but complaining isn&#039;t going to do anything, never has and it never will.

OP&#039;s point is the guns are bringing in a shitstorm that we don&#039;t want. Gun buyers/sellers represent less than 1% of silk road. You aren&#039;t important.

Also the gawker article is good for the site, more people joining the site = more demand for drugs so more people are going to start selling which will force vendors to price their items competitively, i wasn&#039;t raging at you, i&#039;m just sick of people complaining about the site when we are so lucky to have it.
