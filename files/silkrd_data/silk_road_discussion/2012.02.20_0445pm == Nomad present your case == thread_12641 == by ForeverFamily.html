				What right do you have to lock my thread, call me a scammer and effect my sales with no proof of anything? You said in my thread everyone was scammed. What proof do you have of this? I ask over and over again for somebody to test but nobody seems to be able to. Then you just pop in and lock my thread because you&#039;re buddy buddy with some pissed off competition of mine. You are abusing your powers as moderator. Please present any proof of your claim. Or you can avoid answering in front of everyone and just lock the thread like a pussyas you did in the other one.<br /><br />I&#039;m waiting ;D<br /><br />--FF

				Fell alseep on your claimed LSD last night.&nbsp; Ending up eating another 6 tabs with no effects.&nbsp; Luckily for me I still have 15 tabs left I&#039;m willing to send to any moderator to &#039;test&#039;, which I&#039;m sure they will get the same results.&nbsp; Re-dosed everyone that I&#039;ve dosed in the last week from this batch, with a massive increase in dosage, and no effects.&nbsp; Call me a liar or whatever, I&#039;ll stand by this and still label it as &#039;Unknown Obscure Psychadelic.&#039;&nbsp; Either refund me for what you made me finalize early for cause I will never ever in my life say this is LSD after what happened last night.<br /><br />PS:&nbsp; Why is it that some people experienced NO taste, some people experiencing bitterness but no numbing, and some people experiencing bitter + massive numbing?<br /><br />My batch that was sent was indeed, not lysergic acid.

				Ah, good ole&#039; board drama.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had the luxury of reading much of this.&nbsp; Mostly, it seems people watch each others back and give kudos where kudos are deserved.&nbsp; I know nothing of your product, but know a lot about LSD in general.&nbsp; I&#039;d have to say, if 5 hits didn&#039;t get you off.&nbsp; It&#039;s bunk ass &#039;cid.&nbsp; Just a personal opinion.&nbsp; If people are saying your acid sucks, it prolly sucks.&nbsp; Like I said, there will always be the occasional troll/flamer, but if the consensus is that it&#039;s bunk, it&#039;s prolly bunk.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get on the board and call the admins out for siding with the general population of the boards.&nbsp; It&#039;s their job...

				FF, you have 3 threads full of his case. His case is the case of the community, and he is right! You shouldn&#039;t need lab tests to prove your acid is acid. first, you had delivery problems, then weak product, then delivery problems again, then your acid numbs the tongue, throw in a couple early finalize request claims, and feedback loaded with non-delivery, even with refund, you have the track record of a scam.<br />You should be glad he left the thread open as long as he did. <br />He also left your other 2 threads open.

				holly ,<br />didnt you once vouch for FF?&nbsp; maybe I am just confused and am just wondering if maybe they once had good product?:o&nbsp; Anyways there is no way I would order from you FF, any half legit vendor would have at least decent reviews, yours are terrible

				You expect nomad to answer in this thread...Lol. Your issuing a challenge to the wrong guy.<br /><br />Your trash, your gig is up, and the way you word &quot;the calling out of a mod&quot; is a dead give away through immature whining and calling him a pussy is the icing on the cake..<br />O yea and your recent reviews! Durrr I almost forgot! Your just trying to squeeze another day of scamming, another penny from us good folks on Silk Road.<br />And you probably will accomplish this, but you too will burn out soon and I am glad.
