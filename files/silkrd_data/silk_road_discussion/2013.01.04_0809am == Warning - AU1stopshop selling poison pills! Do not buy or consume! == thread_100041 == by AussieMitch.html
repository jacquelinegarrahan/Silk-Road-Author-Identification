				DO NOT BUY THE BLUE LOUIS VUITTON&#039;S THAT AU1STOPSHOP IS SELLING.<br /><br />They went around my area and I personally knew two people who died consuming these pills. A close friend of mine died after consuming 2 tablets, and many people were hospitalized after consuming only 1 pill. Several people I didn&#039;t know where also killed as well, and a girl I knew was hospitalized after consuming only half a tablet with alcohol. These pills shut you down, make you pass out, and can kill you. They are cheap pieces of shit the Nomads pressed and sold for under $10 to make a quick dollar at the expense of peoples lives.<br /><br />http://www.news.com.au/national/louis-vuitton-designer-death-drug-hits-the-streets/story-fndo4ckr-1226463080805<br /><br />Even though he has labelled them PMA he is still giving the impression that one pill is safe to take. IT IS NOT SAFE TO CONSUME EVEN ONE OF THESE PILLS. This is in my opinion a disgusting thing for a vendor to do, and everything this site is against.<br /><br />Just needed to put this up so no-one takes the gamble with their lives.

Why would you trust an anonymous drug dealer sending you powders through the mail. A test kit only cost about $30 and can save your life. If it doesn&#039;t test positive throw the shit away. At least the guy selling the PMA is being honest about it, but anyone would want to take that is beyond me.

				Good point re tester kits.<br /><br />In a perfect world, vendors would only sell safe products.&nbsp; However, this isn&#039;t your local pharmacy, and even most pharm products can screw the wrong person the wrong way.<br /><br />So research what you are going to take, buy tester kits and use your scabby flatmate as a lab rat.<br /><br />Remember that lots of sellers are just Re-Sellers and being a re-seller doesn&#039;t require a degree, they may not know PMA is bad.&nbsp; And at least 1Stop advised it had PMA (if above reports are correct).<br /><br />Again, like I said, perfect world, we wouldn&#039;t have vendors selling PMA and they would know exactly what each chemical in their products do/ risks etc.<br /><br />But we don&#039;t, you have to use pill reports, buy tester machines (still avail in chemists)&nbsp; and research what each test result means. <br /><br />It took weeks for this report on news.com.au to surface and at least a couple of deaths.&nbsp; Be safe, research the product, buy the tested kit and know if you have any adverse reactions to certain substances, health conditions etc.<br /><br />

				i think your thread title is a little misleading and facetious. &quot;poison pills&quot; sounds like he&#039;s selling cyanide or something. he openly advices that they are para-methoxyamphetamine, not ecstasy. he also warns people to be careful and start with half<br /><br />most people would agree that PMA is not a recreational drug, yes,&nbsp; and it can potentially be dangerous for sure, but that goes for lots of chemicals sold here; the pure scopolamine that recently appeared on here comes to mind. let&#039;s be honest, not many people like the drug, and it seems to be only borderline recreational, but some people might enjoy it.&nbsp; this stuff isn&#039;t arsenic, or even 4-MTA- but like 4-MTA, its most severe danger and most of the deaths associated with it come from it being misrepresented as MDMA, and people taking double or triple doses because it has a much longer onset time than E. it&#039;s not even really similar to mdma, it&#039;s a strange SSRA with all sorts of weird effects. not for me<br /><br />however, this website is about freedom, and while i am personally conflicted about the sale of poisons like cyanide that have potential chemistry uses, stuff like PMA is undeniably a drug, and a rather rare one at that. it can be used safely and responsibly. if scopolamine powder and ibogaine have a place on here, so does PMA. my only complaint is that the vendor doesn&#039;t indicate actual dosage in any way, which is troubling. specificity is key to safe drug use. <br />anyways, playing mommy and daddy to keep people safe is how we got in the current mess we are in now. let&#039;s not go down the slippery slope<br /><br />

				I just read the article. This is the most troubling thing I read:<br /><br />&quot;Police, the health department, the ambulance service and the coroner were all alerted to overdoses or a potential bad batch before the death but there has been no public warning.&quot;

I&#039;ve only bought 2C-B from them which was a first time thing, and it was good, i wont do it again, its not really my thing, but yeah it was very clean. But i love my MDMA and i would have been pissed also. <br />Did you send them a message and complain?<br /><br />I checked out that listing, did anyone report it? I did, damn if people are dying from these pills then they must be removed for peoples safety.<br />

				There have been a number of deaths caused by PMA the latest were two people in Cork Ireland that died.

PMA itself has a place on the SR. however, i think the admins may consider removing this specific listing unless more specific dosage is detailed. safety is key after all

				If he has listed them as PMA i don&#039;t see a problem he also has a disclaimer right there. If you think thats dangerous someone has a listing up for POTASSIUM CYANIDE or they did recently.<br /><br />

All we know is that people have been hurt by taking one tablet, and that these pills have killed people. To sell them on SR like that, even though it says they contain PMA, implies that they are safe to eat as long as they are used responsibility. That might be true if we knew that they do contain PMA and if we knew the dosage, but that is not the case with these tablets. It is not necessarily safe to consume even ONE of these, and people have been hospitalized off a half.<br /><br />I think the listing should be removed, people dying from shit they brought online is definitely publicity we don&#039;t need.
