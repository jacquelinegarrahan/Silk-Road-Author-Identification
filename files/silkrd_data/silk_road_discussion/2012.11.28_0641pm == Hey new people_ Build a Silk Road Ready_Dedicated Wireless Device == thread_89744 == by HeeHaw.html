				Hey folks it&#039;s HeeHaw here with some good advice to help keep you safe and make things easier and smoother.<br />&nbsp;Wow where to start? <br /><br />This is not a game. This is a black market website that is being monitored by some government agencies. I have no physical evidence of this except to tell you how you can find this evidence for yourself which leads me to a good rule to always follow.<br /><br />NEVER use the TOR browser for any other site except for onion sites. If you don&#039;t already know TOR stands for The Onion Relay and most legit clearnet public sites will not allow you access if you are using a proxy ip address which is what TOR does. It mask your ip address with a proxy ip. Going outside the onion relay with TOR is risky business. <br /><br />Read the latest news about Silk Road&#039;s investigations by going to a search engine and type &quot;latest news about silk road&quot; into the search box and click search. I use google and it shows up with in the first 5 results. Not the promoted results either ok?<br /><br />Really the best thing is to get a wireless device such as a laptop and dedicate it for Silk Road only and use it at wi-fi hot spots. You need 2 wireless connection cards for it. One that you use when surfing the silk road and the other to leave in your laptop when your not on the road. It&#039;s cool to do the old switch out and keep your silk road wireless connection card hidden til time to surf the road.<br /><br />On this laptop you will need to have an encrypted Operating system like Liberte. If you are going to use windows then use a prated copy that is already activated and when you install it use a fake name and info. Your better off using an encrypted OS in case the feds find you and take your laptop. This is something else that you need to research and do what&#039;s best for you. You could just seperate the wi-fi card from the laptop but that may draw suspicion. It may be a good idea to make an encrypted flash drive to hold some programs. <br /><br />There are several ways to get coin. last time i got coin I used bitinstant.com with the moneygram option at walmart. Just go thru the process and then write all your fake info down and take it with you so you can fill out the blue sheet and hand it to the teller. It&#039;s really that easy and the teller never ask for an ID. I sent it straight to my SR bit coin address. It took maybe an hour to be able to buy drugs after handing that paper to the teller along with the cash. <br /><br />Guys I just buy shit for my own personal needs. I am not buying pounds or kilos of anything and the FEDS are mostly looking for big buyers or people importing.<br /><br />My advice is to only stay on this site long enough to do what you need to do and then get the fuck off it. <br /><br />I&#039;ll probably add more to this at another time. My paranoia is kicking in and I gotta go. People be sure that when you are browsing here in the forums to never be allowing scripts. Look up to the left side of your browser beside the picture of an onion there is an S. go click on it and pick the option that never allows scripts. I know that smiley faces are fun but there is a good reason to do with out them.<br /><br />All opinions and replies are welcome from every member of Silk Road. This is meant to be a general discussion to help inform others about security issues. <br /><br />Anyone want to talk about stealthed portable hard drives?&nbsp; <br />

The more layers you have the harder it will be to get to the source.<br /><br />Coming from an online vendor and a longtime upper level street vendor, you have to go in spurts, or the law of averages will catch up to you. When we start seeing large sums of cash it is easy to get greedy, but stockpiling a bit and then removing yourself for a while will keep you out of trouble.

It&#039;ll take me too long to go point by point over everything, but here&#039;s some highlights:<br /><br />1) TOR was designed for use over the clearweb. Hidden Services came later. There is no danger in browsing the clearweb over TOR. That being said, it is apparent that you are using TOR if the site cares to know.<br /><br />2) If you&#039;re using TOR, you don&#039;t need to be hiding in the bushes stealing your neighbors wifi. <br /><br />3) Two network cards? I assume you mean for MAC address correleation. But you can change the MAC address in software (yes, you really can) I use a script that sets a random MAC on login. Anyway this is only an issue on a local network. MAC addresses aren&#039;t transmitted over the web. Google: OSI Model. <br /><br />4) Encryption is useful, but for god sakes don&#039;t use a pirated cracked windows version. Have you never heard of a rootkit? All your silly security will be rendered moot when you start using that pirated windows copy.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My advice is to only stay on this site long enough to do what you need to do and then get the fuck off it. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That one I agree with. Y&#039;all are slowing down the pipes and I have orders to fill. Fucking window shoppers.

				Hey oso thanks for the reply. Yes I would use pgp to encrypt the info and I would use a password protected rar file.<br /><br />Hey eddie thanks to you also. As I stated everyone is welcome to join the discussion with their experiences and opinions. I didn&#039;t say anything about stealing my neighbors wireless connection. I said use a hot spot. There&#039;s a difference. When I was talking about using a cracked version of windows I meant it would be better then using a legit copy for buying drugs online as long as you have fake information. I am not convinced that it&#039;s safer to just buy drugs online using your own home network but everybody is different.<br /><br />With the network cards I mean you can use one for when you are on the black market sites then replace it with the one that you would use for regular browsing. It&#039;s just a thought but I guess it could prove to be tedious to be changing network cards all the time. <br /><br />A person could create a bootible flash drive with Liberte. Liberte is an encrypted OS and I think it comes with TOR as it&#039;s default browser. While installing, Liberte will take a 10 minute pause and then ask if you are ready to generate a passphrase. You will need this pass phrase each time you boot up with liberte or else it wont boot up.<br /><br />Hey Eddie I&#039;m sorry but TOR wasn&#039;t designed for the clearweb. It was designed by Naval intelligence for communication among operatives to be encrypted. <br /><br />Thanks for the reply you guys<br /><br /><br />

				I must say I also am slightly wary of this advice. 2 WiFi Cards is well overkill and highly unnecessary. <br />Liberte Linux generates a new MAC address upon startup. One of it&#039;s many awesome security features.&nbsp;

This is meant to be a general discussion to help inform others about security issues. <br /><br />Anyone want to talk about stealthed portable hard drives? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think that the advice you offer is good but there are plenty of simpler ways to attain your goals and further protect your identity without going through the process you mentioned. <br /><br />The changing network cards is not necessary, the only identifiable part of it that is encoded in the TCP header is the hardware address, there are plenty of programs to change your MAC address. without the need of changing the actual adapter.. In fact you can go 1 better still. If you use Liberte or Tails linux distros, it will automatically assign a random MAC address every time you start up. This means that you will never browse TOR with the same MAC on 2 different occasions. If you would like to test my theory download wireshark, in the TCP header you will see your mac address, if you use linux run WLAN CONF command&nbsp; to change the MAC and observe all your traffic originating from a different address! The part that should cause most concern is a non proxied IP address, with one call to the ISP you can find out its exact physical location. This is why it is infact better to visit clearnet or onion sites through a TOR exit node, they will either load or display a message saying that its not supported through proxy, the important thing is to always remain anonymous! always browse through a torified connection unless the website you are trying to reach specifically will not allow it (MTGOX, certain banks etc..)<br /><br />As for the dedicated machine, your right, you should keep normal browsing and TOR browsing separate. But you don´t need separate hardware to do this. Buy yourself a 8 or 16Gb thumb drive, the tiny ones the same size as a fingernail. wear it on a chain around your neck. Copy the contents of the Liberté ISO to it and every time you want to connect to TOR out comes the thumb drive into the PC and reboot. This is good for 2 reasons 1. Liberté runs on an encrypted volume, so even if it does fall into the wrong hands you will stand a better chance than if they get your unencrypted hard drive (make sure you use a long passphrase to encrypt) 2. it being always on your person and small at the slightest hint of trouble swallow it. If you really are that paranoid, and then absolutely all trace of your online activities has dissapeared. <br /><br />And of course scrub the shit out of your coins as the poster above me mentioned.. <br /><br />SO all in all, it is not necessary to browse from locations that are not your home if you dont want to because all your traffic is torified. It is not necessary to fuck around with another machine, just put in your thumb drive and reboot. Don&#039;t change network cards and always use PGP for messages and files. <br /><br />Be sensible, scrub your coins, don&#039;t click on links that redirect to clearnet. Darknet was made possible because of TOR, not the other way arouns. <br /><br />ACE
