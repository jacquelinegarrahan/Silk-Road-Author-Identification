				I orderd bitcoin off a genuine site and i went to with draw it to my account and it all says its been confirmed. But my bitcoin balance is still 0.00? I use the bitcoin client that you download on the official bitcoin website. Nothing has come up only on the bottom right hand corner it says - 8 Connections, 129853 blocks , 0 transactions. Can anyone help? Much appreciated.

				I had a similar problem a few days ago.<br /><br />I think it was because I forgot to run TOR and my bitcoin client is set to proxy.<br />I rebooted, ran the TOR bundle, then started bitcoin and went out for a while. By the time I was back everything was in a confirmed.<br /><br />Running it without tor all night before that did nothing. Not even the transactions showed up, confirmed or not.

				Your bitcoin client has to catch up on all the blocks before it can even read any transactions. You don&#039;t need tor on, as of writing this, we&#039;re on block 140711. Google block explorer.

				No, you don&#039;t need tor to do this, but if you have set up to do go thru the proxy, then you need tor running in order for it to see all the blocks. If you aren&#039;t using the socks node through tor, you wont need tor running. It all depends on how its set up.. I need tor running in order for my chain to complete. I think everyone should be using tor with their bitcoin wallet.. one more layer of security..
