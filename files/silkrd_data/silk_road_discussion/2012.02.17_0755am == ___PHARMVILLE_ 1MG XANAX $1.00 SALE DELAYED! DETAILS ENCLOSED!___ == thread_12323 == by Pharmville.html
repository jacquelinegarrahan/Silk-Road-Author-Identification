				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />We are delaying this sale for two reasons: 1. the brand of xanax we bought is from the Eastern Bloc and has no markings so to prevent the &quot;they&#039;re all fake!&quot; crowd from taking their usual potshots, we are going to have 10 people get some free samples and post their reviews on a thread so everyone can know they are good, strong 1mg xanax that are perfectly fine BEFORE we offer them for sale and avoid all that hassle and the deluge of pm&#039;s concerning it.<br /><br />Secondly, the order volume has stayed very high ever since the Customer Appreciation sale (and we are very happy about that, thank you all our regular buyers!) and we are shipping all the orders every day (we shipped every order that was in house up to 12:40pm today) but we need to do some house cleaning before we get swamped with another ton of orders and we are going to do that before we have the xanax sale.<br /><br />Lastly, I have about 115 pm&#039;s that are not answered as of 2:42am tonight, even though the oldest one is only one day old and I want to get all of them answered properly before starting the sale.&nbsp; So probably we will start it on Sunday or Monday, but I&#039;m not guaranteeing anything as I have several appointments Friday for my legit businesses and I don&#039;t know how fast all of this can be taken care of yet.<br /><br />Simply put: we want to get our house totally in order, ready for a deluge of orders and have everyone answered that needs an answer before we start another sale.&nbsp; This seems only prudent.&nbsp; Ben and I have been doing this for 7 months now without a day off and we&#039;ve got to schedule some days off as well in the near future so we have to plan that as well.<br /><br />Thanks for your patience and it WILL be rewarded with $1.00 for 1mg good xanax. :)<br /><br />have a good evening,<br />Alex &amp; Ben

				As king asshat of the last Pharmville xanax scandal (that being me) I would be happy to pay for a sample pack and write a review letting people know if they are legit or not, but I&#039;m sure I will be posting happily that they are legit. If Alex and Ben say something is real, I believe them.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Oxyhoot
