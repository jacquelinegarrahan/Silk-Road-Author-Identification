				Are we able to get more moderators? Possibly from different regions of the world, due to time differences<br /><br />The spam threads from the free bitcoins etc is getting quite excessive,along with the spam private messages.

				To be honest, I haven&#039;t been getting any spam at all. (some threads maybe, but that&#039;s it) - maybe they&#039;re targeting diff regions of the world (target markets?)

				It would be awesome if the moderators that were running things before the meltdown were re-modded and could resume helping the community, since that is our only desire in the first place.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				I was browsing the past few days and saw there was quite a people spamming threads that you just know are a scam. Maybe hire a few more moderators and give them some sort of benefits to the actual market such as a discounts on fee&#039;s to give them more of an incentive to stay active :)

				I thought there were two new moderators appointed once the spam started to get heavy.<br />Constantly adding more mods doesn&#039;t really solve the problem. It would probably be more effective to implement some sort of captcha system based on certain phrases (btkoin for example).
