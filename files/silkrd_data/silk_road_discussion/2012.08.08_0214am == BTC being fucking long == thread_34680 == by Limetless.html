				Yes, I have 7 transfers that have between 6 and 28 confirmations and only the oldest one is showing up in my SR account.&nbsp; I made my first deposit the other day then I saw tons of users were complaining about delays, and it took over 30 hours for the BTC to hit my account here.&nbsp; This is getting disconcerting, but I guess it&#039;s the nature of the beast.<br /><br />I have no idea about the blockchain being fucked with, though.<br /><br />TGM

MBMC<br /><br />PS not as high as the other night but a wee bit high right now. hope this made sense. nodded a couple times during writing this. ; ) cheers n bears!!<br />
