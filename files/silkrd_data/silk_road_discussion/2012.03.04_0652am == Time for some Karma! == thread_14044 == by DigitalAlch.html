				Hey folks! <br /><br />As the forum has grown larger and, admittedly, a bit unruly, it seems high time to help people know who our best contributors are.Many of you will no doubt be familiar with the Karma feature found on many forums these days, and will be happy to see its implementation here on Silk Road Forums.<br />For those of you who don&#039;t know what it is, you now have the ability to &#039;Thank&#039; someone for a post should you find it particularly informative, well written, and all around helpful. You also now have the ability to &#039;discourage&#039; someone should you find their behavior inappropriate. All of this translates into a Karma Rating, seen beneath the avatar on your post. If someone has a particularly high karma rating, you know they are helpful, more likely to be a trustworthy member to ask help from, or to take advice from. On the other hand if they have a negative karma scoring, you know not to take much stock in their advice!<br /><br />The amount of positive / negative karma you can give is very limited, so use it wisely! Thank you guys for continuing to make this a shining community, hopefully, this will help shine a light on some of our wonderful members. Only members with over 100 post can distribute karma, and only one point every 3 days.<br /><br />Lots of love,<br />DigitalAlch

				I think this is a pretty good idea. There&#039;s a lot of people here willing to share their advice and experience and it&#039;s great to able to commend them on their efforts. In fact, SR is the only place I feel comfortable in both RL and on the web talking to people about serious adult topics.

				I think it would be better if forum members were judged on the merits of their posts rather than a somewhat nebulous ratings/popularity system.&nbsp; That being said, I&#039;ll reserve judgment--I just hope we don&#039;t end up with people making posts blatantly seeking karma.&nbsp; I definitely wouldn&#039;t mind lowering moonbear&#039;s karma score a bit though...

				In a perfect world... I love the idea. I like the fact that your points are limited and earned after 100 posts.<br /><br />What I dont like about the feature is most will only say what people want to hear. Not many will stand up and say what they truly believe if it goes against the general consensus at that point in time. <br /><br />I like the fact that I can bring up an argument I see perfectly logical and have it smashed by someone, thus changing my point of view. I think myself and others will get penalized or discouraged for this.<br /><br />So its a post it note over the karma score for me ;)<br /><br />There is nothing you can say to me that I will give you a discouragement point for. Please be kind my brothers and sisters ;D

				After some thought, now I&#039;m seeing why Mods aren&#039;t allowing to see what posts generated good/bad karma<br /><br />You do what you do and that is either a contribution or a detriment to SR....<br /><br />knowing when people giving you thumbs up or thumbs down would potentially alter what you bring to the community (ie you make a lot of dick-sucking posts to get a lot of +1 karma, when you dont truly mean it).<br /><br />So the current karma system gives you a pat on the back/kick in the crotch for acting how you normally act, but you cant karma-chameleon to get +1&#039;s you dont truly earn (or change -1 posts to seem like less a douchetill)<br /><br />Anyways, Mods - you guys are geniuses. +1,000karma points to Nomad, DigitalAlch,ChroniPain, DreadPirate,etc

				Just wanted to weigh in on this publicly - as those of you who are familiar with the system will vouch, the karma system is unreliable right now. It&#039;s only been a few days! People will give you a -1 karma for the Lulz, strictly. In fact, saying &quot;OMG I HAVE -1 KARMA&quot; on the forums is almost certain to garner you at least one more -1 (bet I get one from this post too;))<br /><br />Point is that you have to think long-term : eventually the karma points will stretch into tens/hundreds/more. At that point they will be extremely useful. <br /><br />To those of you (like me) who have gotten a few minus or a few plus - recognize that all that means is one or two people (out of about 13,500 registered users) clicked the &quot;wahhhh&quot; button under your name (or the &quot;yayyy&quot; button, as the case may be). <br /><br />In other words, don&#039;t worry about it! The karma system *is* all but worthless right now. A person with -0/+2 karma is the same as a person with no rating whatsoever.<br /><br />However, when you see someone with -2,928/+12, you know that you probably shouldn&#039;t trust that person that you should inject a quad of cocaine into your johnson. And *that* is the idea. Savvy?

				@SpeedCrunch:<br /><br />I can’t believe I’m posting this, but since you are so upset about it, I thought I should come clean and tell you IT WAS ME who gave you the -1 karma. I did this because I was really irritated by a post of yours in which you more or less claimed that bad acid trips do not exist. I argued against this in the original thread, and also gave bad karma to another poster in the same thread who made the same claim. Your post is here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13376.msg130779#msg130779<br /><br />As far as I know, at the time of posting this comment, you were still quite new to LSD, and had publicly stated in other forum posts that you had only tripped about 3-4 times on low to medium doses. I felt that you were spreading an opinion that was uninformed and unhelpful.<br /><br />As someone who has suffered from several bad trips on acid, one of them being quite recent and psychologically distressing, I really resented reading your post. Bad trips are very real and very serious, and not something to be taken lightly or dismissed altogether.<br /><br />Other than this, I find your trip reports and general posts to be quite interesting, and I have responded to them with thanks. I appreciate your overall contribution to the forums, and I’m sure I will give you positive karma in the future, but the bad trip comment seriously pissed me off. <br /><br />In my opinion, this was not abuse of the karma system. Is the karma system not more or less the same as a “Like” or “Dislike” button? I strongly disliked your post and felt entitled to leave you negative karma on that basis.<br /><br />I feel kind of bad now, knowing that you discovered the -1 karma while you were tripping on acid yourself. Given my reasons, it is strangely ironic that you found out whilst tripping. I sincerely hope that it didn’t cause you to have a bad trip, as I would not wish that upon anyone. <br /><br />I’m shocked that it made you feel so stressed that you had to dose yourself with Diazepam, geez. I’m genuinely sorry for hurting your feelings, but I must say that I honestly don’t think you should care so much what other people think, especially when it’s people on an anonymous drug forum. No one here is a huge or significant part of your life and their opinions shouldn’t matter so much.<br /><br />Feel free to leave me -1 karma in retaliation for causing you that amount of stress. I’m sure others will do the same, but I don’t particularly care. As far as I’m concerned, this forum is for exchanging intel regarding security issues, vendors, drug information, and harm minimisation – it’s not supposed to be a circle jerk where everybody just plays nice with each other.

				BRB, that certainly was not something trivial, and I dont really think you should need to apologize. I honestly disagree with SC about how there arent really bad trips. In my opinion this is incorrect and from a lack of experience... I can see if you had horrible experiences in the past you would be pretty adamant regarding the fact and if she dismissed your personal experiences I understand how one would likely consider discouraging the user for making such erroneous claims. <br /><br />There are definitely such things as bad trips SC, some people are able to work through them and they end up being positive, but psychedelics possess the potential for emotionally unsettling experiences that can have serious long term implications on ones psyche. For someone to dismiss such experiences could potentially lead others to lose their respect for the chemicals and promote irresponsible use which should be discouraged.<br /><br />Nice of you to respond and let SC know why since she was curious. I am glad I was wrong about the SWIM thing and it was something reasonable. Kinda ironic regarding how the karma caused so much stress and what some may consider a bad trip really since SC needed to take diazepam. It is unfortunate SC was in a sensitive position due to tripping, and therefore got a little upset, but her karma has certainly improved so this probably isnt much of an issue now. I hope no one gives you negative karma for just using the system as it was intended imo

				I&#039;d like to post my agreement with the many suggestions that we be able to see the specific posts that we have received karma for. <br /><br />I think everyone should be able to see the karma posts in a person&#039;s profile). Having the karma posts displayed would significantly decrease the amount of unwarranted petty karma. Even if you couldn&#039;t necessarily see who doled out the karma, people would be more conscientious about it to who and for what they are giving it for. <br /><br />As TravellingWithoutMoving pretty much said, I don&#039;t think people really take into consideration the purpose of the karma system when they are handing it out. Especially when it comes to negative karma. Often times people use it as an anonymous means to &quot;get back&quot; at someone. Getting even with someone and discouraging behavior are two separate ideas with two separate motives. There&#039;s really not much you can do to get rid of your negative karma unless the person who gave it decides to take it away. And after some time, that&#039;s simply just not likely to happen.<br /><br />Lastly, karma is the one definitive &quot;weapon&quot; trolls have to use against other members, and they obviously don&#039;t hesitate to use it. So I think adding a feature or two that could deter people from abusing the system is good for the community.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s my 0.02 BTC.
