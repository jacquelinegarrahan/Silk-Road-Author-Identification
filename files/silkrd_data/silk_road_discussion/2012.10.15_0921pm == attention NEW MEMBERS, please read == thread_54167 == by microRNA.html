				welcome to the Road. First, see the thread up top that says &quot;read this before posting&quot; - PLEASE go read that!&nbsp; i will make it even easier for you actually, go here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=42090.0<br /><br />but because no one ever does: :)<br /><br />Every five threads is a new member posting an introduction and/or asking questions that have been answered a thousand times. please STOP. before posting go read the thread mentioned above^^^ <br /><br />if you have questions, read the SR wiki before posting simple questions especially regarding bitcoins, pgp, ordering - you can find all that here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />depending on the topic of your post, there is an appropriate place to make the thread. please post your thread where it belongs. <br />for example, this category is NOT for introductions. if you want to introduce yourself, please do so here: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7427.0<br /><br />if you are having trouble connecting to SR or the forums, try clicking &quot;use new identity&quot; on the tor control panel and reloading the page<br /><br />finally, unless you have a vendor account - you are NOT allowed to post offers on the forum: no business is allowed to be conducted on the forum, only on the market site. nearly everyone making offers on the forum without linking to their SR vendor page is trying to scam you, be careful please <br />(this especially includes offers to buy/sell bitcoins, including the current btkoin.com spam)<br /><br />PGP walk through: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br /><br />ESCROW: SR protects the buyer by holding funds until the order arrives, immediately after it arrives you should finalize to release the funds to the vendor! if you finalize early which some vendors require of new buyers - please be aware you are NOT protected and may risk losing your money.&nbsp; should your order not arrive, a link to &quot;resolve&quot; will appear and you should use it to prevent auto-finalization where your funds are automatically given to the vendor after a certain amount of time (dont allow it to A-F ever, it ruins your buyer stats and can get you blacklisted, not to mention enabling scammers to use the excuse they need people to FE because of A-F)<br /><br />SR BTC addy: its best to click &quot;get new address&quot; each time you make a new deposit to avoid issues, like deposits taking forever<br /><br />if you actually read this, thank you very much<br /><br />edit: more info about becoming a vendor, karma, SR pin, contacting SR support, and forum search function below

				Becoming a VENDOR: if you want to become a seller it will cost 150 usd (i think, unless it changed)&nbsp; - register a new username, one that you have not used to buy from, then go to &quot;account&quot; where on the right side is the link to &quot;become a seller&quot; - make sure you read the sellers guide which a link will appear for as well <br /><br />KARMA:&nbsp; once you reach 100 posts you will be able to give other members karma, links to &quot;thank&quot; or &quot;discourage&quot; will appear under the members karma score. imo i recommend you try to give out positives to thank others frequently - whenever you appreciate a members post, such as a review you found helpful, especially if they took time to answer your question, or even if you just thought their comment was funny. for me, negatives are best reserved for those seldom individuals who really deserve them - when they are clearly disrespecting other members, trolling, breaking SR guidelines, etc but imo not intended just because they have a different opinion or viewpoint then you, you dont agree, or even if they make a mistake while posting... we all should show respect and understanding to our fellow members of this revolutionary community <br /><br />SEARCH: sometimes the search will give an error about your last search being less than 5 seconds - just try your search again. i am pretty sure if you are in a sub-forum and use the search function it will only search that category. to search the entire forum use the search box on the home page<br /><br />PIN information can be found in this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22136.0<br /><br />to Contact SR SUPPORT: there is a link at the bottom right of SR which says &quot;contact us&quot; <br /><br />if you have used all the resources mentioned and still have questions, please feel free to post them and i will do my best to answer. but if you ask something like what are bitcoins and how do i get them, dont expect much assistance

				did you read the first part of my signature - where i say to do research on any chem you decide to ingest? <br /><br />well if everyone did 10 seconds of research they would know it will cause parkinsons disease like symptoms or death. <br /><br />its there to prove a point - to help teach an important lesson, and partly for my amusement as well when people message me asking for it... then i ask them if they researched it and they say yes of course, that they know how much to take safely... then i tell them not to lie to me :) <br /><br />im not actually giving out samples of a neurotoxin prodrug... i love every member of this community far too much<br /><br />plus i dont have a vendor acct and am not allowed to give out samples anyway, nor do i provide a public key for address encryption

				I think the best newbie advice I&#039;ve seen is to just slow down.<br /><br />Yes, the &quot;Welcome to Silk Road&quot; page is like the big-boy Santa came early.&nbsp; Yes, my saliva glands started working overtime too.&nbsp; Yes, I have never ever heard of that one either, I wonder what it&#039;s like?<br /><br />However, slow down.&nbsp; Take your time.&nbsp; Read.&nbsp; Explain to yourself why Bitcoins are a considered &quot;pseudo-anonymous&quot; currency.&nbsp; Find a way to purchase Bitcoins for less than an 8% charge.&nbsp; Determine your risk acceptance -- are you going to send coins directly to the Silk Road?&nbsp; Are you going to use a laundry service?&nbsp; Which one, and why do you trust them?&nbsp; What drop are you going to use?&nbsp; Should you send your orders to a PO box?&nbsp; Which vendors for your DoC have good reviews?&nbsp; Which are scammers?&nbsp; Should you ever FE?&nbsp; Why bother with this complicated PGP thing?<br /><br />All these questions are answered here, multiple times.&nbsp; Come, join the community, we&#039;re glad you&#039;re here!&nbsp; Just, keep yourself safe.<br />

				Hi Garnet, you specify the name no one perfect way you shop!<br />First of all you need to stock up on Bitcoin wallet.<br />I do not know if you know the basics, but you can not pay his country&#039;s currency USD.<br />Read and understand Garnet - buyer&#039;s guide and forums.<br />Greetings.<br />PS. You do not want to judge, but I do not know if your age will allow you to comprehend.<br />Sorry for my bad English.

				After bumbling &amp; fumbling my way thru SR - I finally decided to start reading these forums. Now most of my questions are easily answered simply by searching the threads. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Newbies like me - READ THESE THREADS!!!

				I made one order on SR before discovering the forums, however given what gets posted in the forums it is quite clear many people make zero effort to educate themselves on the basics on how to stay safe even though all the information is right there in front of their faces if they only took the time to do some reading, it is disconcerting to say the least! I just hope as more people discover SR they will be guided to threads like this before making any orders.<br /><br />

				Thank you for the very imformative post! I have my 50 posts. Thought I already made them the other day, guess I was high. But I could have sworn I posted in the PGP club practice thread not in the noobie section. Somehow lost a post or something ridiculous.
