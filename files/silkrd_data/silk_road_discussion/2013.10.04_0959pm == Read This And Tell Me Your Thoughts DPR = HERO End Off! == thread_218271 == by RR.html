				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Silk road was amazing because it made drugs safer and diminished violence down to zero. The buyer had a feedback mechanism which a buyer on the street doesn&#039;t get and so if a seller delivers a bad or dangerous product then they get bad feedback and have to lower their price or take ages building up their reputation again. Because drugs are illegal traders on the streets resort to violence to settle disputes because they are not aloud to use a 3rd party arbitrator. SR gave the market that. I don&#039;t use drugs and don&#039;t like to see what they can do to some people but it is interesting to see how a proper de-regulated market place can bring safety, quality and price competition to something as Dangerous, notoriously low quality, high priced and un competitive as the illegal street drug scene. If the War on drugs is there to keep people safe then they have just shot them selves in the foot by bringing down SR<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just read this online and i couldnt have said it better myself

				It really saddens me reading this, its all still sinking in, I keep thinking I can log inn now and then. I know things in my life wont ever be quite the same, sr allowed me to use cannabis safely, its all I ever purchased from sr, I have no desire to take hard drugs, I am quite happy just to use cannabis responsibly and not even daily, its just nice to know its there.<br /><br />Some of the vendors on here have been an absolute pleasure to talk to, I will miss chatting about different strains and sharing knowledge etc, <br />one vendor in particular I will miss is Doctornoname, such a caring guy, would often go out of his way to help you out, I know he helped others out by giving them free root balm cream which was made out of cannabis leaf trim and the seconds but it was very helpful and effective, I used it for all sorts of ailments and it treated them better than any modern day pharmaceuticals could, this is just an example of many great guys and girls on sr doing the best they could, even the idiots eventually started learning how to be civil, some vendors that were once a bit cocky or shady turned in to helpful people, realizing that the drugs world does not have to be dark and seedy.<br /><br />I have sr to thank for helping me recover from a bad illness, if it were not for the quality cannabis I consumed from here I know I would not of recovered as quick maybe not at all. The sooner people realize that just because someone uses cannabis to heal themselves rather than using a bunch of dangerous/additive pills that this does not make them a bad person and certainly not one to be punished. In years to come we will look back at how we used to punish those that wanted to heal themselves or feel different and cry tears of shame, this world is still very barbaric in many senses and these ridiculous drug laws are a fine example of how unevolved the human race can be at times.<br /><br />I only intended on posting a sentance or two just now but who knows how long the forums will be up, I would just like to thank all the vendors and all of the community for helping me and many others get back their lives, we all worked together, we rarely argued, we werent doing anybody any harm. We can only move forward from this situation, I have a feeling Silk Road will be a part of many peoples story of when they turned their lives around, <br />all we can do is learn and move on.<br /><br />RIP Silk Road, its been life changing and a pleasure.<br /><br />
