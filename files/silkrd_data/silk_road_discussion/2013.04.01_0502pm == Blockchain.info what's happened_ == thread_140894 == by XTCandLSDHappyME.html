				Hello everyone. I am in the UK and have always used blockchain.info to purchase my bitcoins. Just recently there has been a change and when using sorfort banking it says to pay in € not £ and there are several European countries listed but not the UK. Also pingit and bank transfer say currently disabled.. Does anybody know what is going on?

				:( it&#039;s pretty shit. i don&#039;t think anyone knows exactly what&#039;s going on but don&#039;t expect it to come back anytime soon. british banks hate bitcoins. i&#039;m not sure if its due to anti money laundering laws or if they just see it as a threat or are getting pressured by govt but the same thing has happened in the past with mt gox and intersango getting their british accounts shut down. i don&#039;t think any big exchanges have uk bank transfer options anymore. you might want to start looking into other options.

				The say on twitter &quot;UK deposits ceased indefinitely. Apologies for any inconvenience.&quot;<br />https://twitter.com/blockchain/status/317390709026066434<br /><br />I saw on Reddit that someone saw the person behind blockchain.info&#039;s twitter account replied to another person asking why with simply &quot;VAT, fraud, banks&quot;, but they then deleted it. Sounds entirely plausible though.

				Oh well that sucks!! Does anybody know if there are any other big exchanges that deal with UK customers? Also can anybody suggest another safe and easy alternative?
