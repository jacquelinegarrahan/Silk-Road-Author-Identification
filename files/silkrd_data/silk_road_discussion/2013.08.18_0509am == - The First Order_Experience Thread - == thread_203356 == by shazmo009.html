				This thread is just for people to share their experience about when they &#039;first&#039; ordered anything from SR. How did you find SR, what was the order and any others details you would like to share about the experience!<br /><br />My first order was only a 0.25 of ice. I had been lurking and browsing for a fair while before I decided to buy some btc and give it a shot. I only ordered the ice domestic as I wanted to get a feel for the site and how it all works. To be honest I had butterflies when the mail was delivered that day and in a way I felt liberated. I could not believe I had bought product on the internet and had it delivered to me through the mail. Amazing experience really. I have made a couple more domestic since then and im now waiting on my first packages to be shipped internationally. Hopefully they make them through ok :)<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if many people will join the thread and im sorry if this sounds cheesy but I felt so proud to be a part of this that I want to know how others felt when they popped their silk cherry. It truly was an amazing experience for me and at the end of the day it wasn&#039;t just about getting drugs...Its more than that...
