				Some people don&#039;t like the &quot;lend me a few BTC&quot; threads, some people don&#039;t mind them and a few people have said they shouldn&#039;t be allowed. <br /><br />What do you think?

				I don&#039;t care and understand sometimes you come up a few bucks short. I asked for two bucks on here once, but I have given out over 20 to people in need.<br /><br />The only times it bothers me when a person has only a few posts and is begging. I think someone should at least provide something for the forum by making some good posts and becoming familiar with the other users before going around and begging. I wouldn&#039;t ask a stranger for change, but I would and acquaintance or friend.<br /><br />

				Negotiating is part of drugs transaction, and think it always should be, but there is a right of passage that you should follow first. You should spend money and prove to be loyal before trying a negotiation.<br /><br />I have negotiated with many vendors on here.

				They don&#039;t bug me but thats because it&#039;s fun to talk shit to these guys with one post.&nbsp; Although I don&#039;t really want a beggers forum with the wide amount of beggers we might just need one.&nbsp; To keep the main forum area clear since you can always hide the sub forum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another idea could be we have a forum section for it but you can only post in it if you have enough post so it keeps newbs out and helps out veterans. <br /><br />Just my 2cents

				Mr. Smith would get a better deal if he is a hassle free customer, polite, spends well, and gains you business. I am not saying this should be what every vendor does, but this is why some people decide to hook up certain customers of theirs. <br /><br />Every transaction doesn&#039;t need to be negotiated I have definitely bought way more listings for regular listing price than anything, but if I am doing steady business and have helped gain customer basis for someone it is nice to get some appreciation every once in awhile. I would never demand anything, it is just something that is usually offered to me as a token of appreciation. <br /><br />

				A lot of times businesses do give discounts to good customer&#039;s. There is a restaurant I go to all the time and I receive 10% off my bill. I used to buy cannabis seeds and would get a deal if certain amount of cash is spent.<br /><br />Maybe our difference in location breeds different business attitudes. I thought this was common business practices. I am unaware how business is done in the U.K. I know in the middle east it is almost exclusively done by bartering though.<br /><br />This is an interesting thread. I like learning of different cultural practices.

They expand to quickly without the correct infrastructure in place to deal with an ever-increasing volume of orders. If you look at Tony76, this is probably why he decided to pull that shit and disappear over the rainbow because he was selling too many products and could not cope with the shear volume of sales. Most recently we have seen Pfand has been a victim of this too when he expanded into the Blow market. The problem is to do with mentality where Vendors naturally (and quite understandably) feel they need to move as much product as possible before their supply dries or they get caught whereas in actuality so long as your security is maintained and you have all the time in the world and being selective with your customers actually adds longevity to&nbsp; your business because it decreases the chances you are selling to A. Kids and B. Cops. Growth is important to every business but managing that growth and maintaining full control at all times is the only way to reach the real goal that is sustainability. So not allowing customers to duck what may only be a few pounds is just what I see as a vital tool for cutting the wheat from the chaff when it comes to my customer list because the ones that don&#039;t ask will by default always be the more reliable and stable customer. <br /><br />Logic my friends, it&#039;s what separates us from the animals. :)

Anything more than 0.3btc is taking the piss but it would be nice to have a thread or forum dedicated to these requests and get rid of all the threads in SR discussion and off-topic.

				Yeah basically, I have decided to be more strict on this shit. Like if it&#039;s like under 1BTC, then I&#039;ll let it go. If it&#039;s over that it&#039;s getting locked down. People are asking for $20-50 today and it&#039;s taking the Swedish and then they have the gall to get lemon about it after someone calls them out. Beggers are one thing, cheeky beggers are quite another.

				Hi, just a side note:<br /><br />Someone made a prediction that adding some price break features to listings could cut down on the begging posts (it would definitely cut down on the number of repeat listings on the road). If someone accidentally gets 1% short for their qty. 100 order, they could still order qty. 98 and get almost as good a price (assuming the vendor has well-chosen price breaks), instead of having to order like 9 sets of 10 for 1.25x the price or whatever. <br /><br />I think credit goes to a customer in a PM.<br /><br />Peace

				They really rub me the wrong fucking way to be honest. It&#039;s so simple, just buy an extra 1 BTC to transfer to your SR wallet and always deposit some extra money in your mtgox account or whatever exchange you use. That way, if you&#039;re short, you can buy more BTC in an instant.<br /><br />So no, I&#039;m not lending you 0.3 BTC. Learn to plan ahead or learn to wait a few more days.

				I think the amount of posts the user has under their belt also come into play. It seems someone who has 250 posts and asks for 2 BC is probably more legit than someone who has 2 posts asking for it. Just my opinion. Either way, I support the subforum option.

				Silkroad should offer a lend us a coin service to it&#039;s customers or something, just if they are short they can get a loan of 1BTC. obviously this would only be available to buyers with a certain number of transactions and $ spent and of course SR can charge a small % and the debt will automatically be repaid next time you top up your account.

				vendors are no better then buyers. Who cares if somebody ask for a favor? Is it hurting you or your family? People with money have no idea how it is, well some do but some just think it&#039;s funny to call other people names. If you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth then that&#039;s great for you but why make it harder on those less fortunate? If somebody wants to help out others then why stick your nose in it?&nbsp; If someone wants to try to borrow money then why stick your nose in it? So all the people who go borrow money from banks or whatever, they are all beggers. Just because somebody starts a thread asking to borrow bit coin does not mean that they are not hard working individuals who has respect for other people.

				I lent less than 1 BTC to a random user who was asking for it on the forum, he had some posts and seemed legit, I didn&#039;t really care if the money was lost, he paid it back to me plus a few % interest<br /><br />It so happened that later I made the mistake of ordering close to the exact amount of BTC for a transaction, not considering BTC fluctuation, ofcourse it did fluctuate - I didn&#039;t want to inconvenience the vendor (especially as a new buyer) and ask for a discount, so I went on the forum and the above-mentioned user lent me some money<br /><br />I can see how as a vendor the constant begging for samples and then people begging for BTC on the forum could get annoying

				I have not looked at this thread before now. I just voted and replied, so bear with me.<br /><br />I know it has been said a 10000x and I know it is even one of the voting options (I just picked it)<br /><br />Create a damn &quot;Skid Row/Beggars Corner&quot; forum and be done with it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t want to see beg threads. Don&#039;t look in that forum.<br /><br />Someone posts a beg thread outside of there. Warn them and move it.<br /><br />Feeling generous with your .43322933 BTC. Go donate it to the begs!<br /><br />I think this will solve the problem 2 ways.<br /><br />1) I (we) wont have to see beg threads out in the open all day long.<br />2) with beg threads getting less exposure (from the forum as a whole) then there is the possibility that they will stop being effective hence people will stop posting beg threads!!<br /><br />I personally do not care if they are effective or not. Throw them in Skid Row and let them fend for themselves.<br /><br />PS - I am not as heartless as I may seem. I can imagine what it is TRULY like to have everything &quot;planned&quot; and then come up short by .05BTC Im sure it sucks. I am also sure this has happened to legit people that have borrowed and paid back as promised. One good turn deserves another, but if I was on the street I would expect to see pan-handling in the subway. Not in my Living Room! <br />

				Create a stickied thread for begging/giving. Sample posts:<br /><br />&quot;Hey, .25 BTC short, could someone lend a hand? Pay back after Dwolla/whatever clears. Thanks much.
