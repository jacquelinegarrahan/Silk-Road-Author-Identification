				From a business point of view, that&#039;s the SAFEST way you could ever get away with doing something like that.&nbsp; Less chance to slip up.&nbsp; Less chance to get addicted to whatever you&#039;re selling.. it just seems like what I would do if I ever wanted to get in this game.&nbsp; <br /><br />One fuck up and you&#039;re done.&nbsp; There&#039;s like.. no room to even get fucked up in that equation.&nbsp;

				Well, if it&#039;s meth or similarly powerful stims you&#039;re talking about... I dunno.&nbsp; You can get a lot of shit done on meth if you&#039;re used to it.&nbsp; You always end up pushing it too far and fucking up though eventually, it seems.&nbsp; Anything else you at least have to sleep eventually no matter how much of it you&#039;re on.<br /><br />Honestly man, the way business is done here is so mechanical people could have machine lines doing the job for them basically.&nbsp; I mean seriously, one piece of software and the mechanical assembly to package things up and voila, there you go, you&#039;re gonna be the biggest goddamn vendor SR&#039;s ever seen because you can fill orders w/o almost any effort no matter how fast they come in.&nbsp; Fucked up or not, something that mechanical or repetitive isn&#039;t really hard to do.<br /><br />If you mean the whole RL connections side, that&#039;s not really an SR issue, more of a constant thing that drugs will definitely fuck up if you let them, sure.&nbsp; For my part, I think drugs are almost never beneficial to one&#039;s life in any way other than adding pleasure or with very well controlled use, possibly productivity.&nbsp; Generally they&#039;ll fuck you and your activities up pretty easily though.&nbsp; I know we love drugs around here and all, but really, don&#039;t we all know that&#039;s pretty true in the end?

				When the Silk Road site was down I recall reading a post from an admin that said DPR, runner of the Silk Road was drinking only coffee, working his ass off to get everything online. <br /><br />So you might have a thesis in some cases.<br /><br />Although I&#039;m not a top vendor, and I do many, many drugs.

				I only really take MDMA and smoke the occasional bit of weed.<br /><br />While I&#039;m not officially a top-vendor, or even a vendor yet, when I do open my account - people will be blown away by my MDMA, it&#039;s the shit!<br /><br />Even with the huge amounts I have sitting around, it&#039;s just not the kind of high I would want to feel everyday.<br /><br />Such a beautiful drug when used properly.

There are definitely people that can handle taking their own shit while still keeping it professional and not fuck up, but I feel they are kind of few and far between. When I see a vendor that that has a million sales and people raving about how great a seller they are, I kind of picture a fairly normal, get up and go business oriented individual with a slightly different lifestyle/moral compass than most people who are motivated by the same enterprising mentality.<br /><br />A good rule to remember, though, is &quot;If you&#039;re a crackhead, sell dope. If you&#039;re a dopehead, sell crack.&quot; Because if you already are kind of a junkie and want to be a dealer, you sure as hell shouldn&#039;t sell your drug of choice.

				I don&#039;t know about on SR but I know a few IRL dealers that sell just so they can consume their profits. What I mean by that is someone will buy an oz(28g) for £150, sell 15g for £10 a gram and keep the 13g for themselves.<br /><br />I take a 2-3 grams out of all my batches to test quality.<br /><br />Dank

				You think the big time dealers here need to sell to do drugs?<br /><br />The fact is they&#039;re getting that shit for dirt cheap if they can offer us what they do at those prices..<br /><br />Example: all the MDMA dealers, they sell it for almost dirt cheap and still make a profit obviously because they keep doing it.&nbsp; they&#039;re probably THE source or one away from it

				It takes a lot of self control.<br />Once upon a time I decided to start selling ounces of cocaine, (my recreational drug of choice)<br />basically start and end of story is I got incredibly high as fuck off my own supply and within a week I made no money off of it and gave most of it away (while high). <br />Lol.<br /><br />Basically, sell what you aren&#039;t in to. If you love mdma don&#039;t sell it, hence I sell mdma, and it is not my drug of choice. Some people just have better self control than others though.

The vendors that are seriously connected IRL in the drug scene. These are the people that can afford to let a brick(kg) of MDMA go for $13,000, or sheets of cleaan high quality LSD at $550 a sheet, &amp; so on and so forth.<br /><br />Theres also alot of small time guys that pretty much just nickle and dime stuff that they get from the big time vendors that are infact most probably the first step down from a serious connect, if not the manufacturer them selves.

				No, I see what you&#039;re getting at.&nbsp; I&#039;m just thinking from the perspective that money -- and I mean I like it just as much as the next guy, don&#039;t get me wrong -- has no use except to spend.&nbsp; So it&#039;s value is basically nothing more than what you can trade it for.<br /><br />It does kind of have its own little... appeal though, doesn&#039;t it, lol.

When a dealer gets raided, ALL of said person&#039;s finances will be frozen. ALL cash will be seized, Cars forfeited, even the house you own could be taken from you if you do not have Tax documents proving you didn&#039;t pay for the home with drug money. So yeah..... selling to support habit is the same as selling to make stacks of cash. Either way, if you get busted you&#039;re prolly gonna be broke. (unless most of your money was in Bitcoin and not findable by the law. Even then, by the time you get out of prison, bitcoin may not exist. &lt;shrugs&gt;

				Seems some of the heroin/meth vendors in the past may have been using their supply. Either that or they are unstable characters generally&nbsp; ;).&nbsp; Why cloud your judgement when doing a job that already attracts a lot of paranoia.&nbsp; If you start using an addictive drug you offer in almost endless supply, unless you have extreme willpower it will harm business.
