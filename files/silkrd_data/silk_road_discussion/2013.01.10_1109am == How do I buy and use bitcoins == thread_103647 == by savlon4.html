				For goodness sake, don&#039;t take any &#039;helpful&#039; advice concerning bitcoins you see on this forum.<br /><br />That said, I will give you some non-scam advice that will serve you well.<br /><br />For your bitcoin wallet, use &#039;electrum&#039;. Many people new to bitcoin lose all their bitcoins when they forget their password. Use electrum. It has a method of recovery.<br /><br />http://electrum.org/<br /><br />Do not purchase bitcoins on SR. There might be some legitimate merchants (I don&#039;t know), but the number of BTC related scams here is staggering. Buying bitcoins is not illegal. There is no reason to go some crazy circuitous route to buy them. Do you live in the USA? The use bitinstant.com or mtgox.com. Under no circumstances use moneypak to buy bitcoins.
