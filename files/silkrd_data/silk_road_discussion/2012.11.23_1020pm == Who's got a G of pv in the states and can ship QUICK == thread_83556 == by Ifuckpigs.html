				I would help you out if I had a seller account. I ordered a gram from QD/chembros, got it, used some but as it turns out it&#039;s not for me. She also sent two more bags, if I pulled out my scale and weighed it all I&#039;m sure I&#039;d have at least a gram altogether.

No, I&#039;ve binged on it a number of times and have never felt any kind of psychosis, let alone wanting to eat someone&#039;s face. Maybe I&#039;ve just been lucky? Or maybe I&#039;m just someone that the drug just agrees with&nbsp; chemically?<br /><br /><br />Only negative effect I&#039;ve ever had was inability to sleep. Maybe that&#039;s what led the dude to eat face. No sleep for too long will fuck you UP. I&#039;m always fine cause I keep a few trams/benzos on hand.<br /><br /><br /><br />ugh, no other vendors, seriously??? :(<br /><br /><br />

Then again speedy things have never been for me. I really prefer opiates, but of course the price for those here on SR is way too much for me to afford. Although I did recently order MrDutchGuy&#039;s fentanyl nasal spray...so excited for that to arrive :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83556.msg621728#msg621728">Quote from: shitwassocash on November 24, 2012, 07:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if it wasn&#039;t against rules, I&#039;d totally be willing to buy it off you. it&#039;s a small amount of money, and I&#039;m going on like 2 months without any fun MDPV times. &gt;:I<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I knooooow.&nbsp; I bought it to try and figured it might not be for me, so I thought I&#039;d deal it amongst my friends. Unfortunately my friends aren&#039;t very smart so I&#039;m afraid to deal in amounts larger than 100mgs at a time, and it looks like such a small amount that people are put off to pay what I&#039;m asking for it (which is a fair price in my opinion, but I understand, 100mgs doesn&#039;t look like much). So now I&#039;ve got all this PV, and all I want is to break even at this point.
