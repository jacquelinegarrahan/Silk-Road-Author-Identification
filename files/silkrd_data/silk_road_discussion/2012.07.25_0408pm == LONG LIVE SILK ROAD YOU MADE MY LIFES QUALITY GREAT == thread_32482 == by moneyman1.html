				And i wanna add that this place is not what i expected. Much more helpful and plain cool people than i thought. What i red on the surface web implied that theres a child molester or mass murderer behind every second guy here. Not something a peaceful pothead like me looks forward to.<br />But my business deals here were a pure joy. Good communication and customer service, better than most i encounter IRL. Maybe i just got lucky with my new online retailer but the bad PR is really unjustified :)<br />
