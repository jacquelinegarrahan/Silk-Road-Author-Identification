				So Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak have a podcast they do a couple of times a week called No Agenda. <br />It goes over all kinds of topics, and it pretty interesting in itself, but on the episode from Sunday the 18th, Adam talks quite a bit about the Road. He goes into a good amount of detail, more so than I have read from other journalists. <br />From the sound of it, I don&#039;t doubt at all he is part of our community. I just thought it was interesting to hear, and thought I would pass it on.

Nice find, I&#039;ll be listening to it later.<br /><br />He may just be experienced through investigation... though that is passing an opinion before listening to how he talks about it. From my knowledge of the duo, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised though to find out they are.<br /><br />Honestly, I bet we have some very interesting people that linger around the place, either by proxy of others... or as themselves... especially for figures who may find/believe its more secure/anonymous than the other route (see also: Rob Ford, Toronto&#039;s Mayor...).

				John C. Dvorak is also certainly no friend of the government so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if his commentary were pretty empathetic to SR users maybe mixed in with some &quot;kids these days&quot; old-timer talk.<br /><br />Thanks for the heads up, I might check it out.
