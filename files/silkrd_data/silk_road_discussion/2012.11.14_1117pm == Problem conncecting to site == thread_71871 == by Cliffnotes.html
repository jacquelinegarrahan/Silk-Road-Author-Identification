				I can not seem to even be able to connect to silk road. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m using the wrong website or if Silk Road doesnt like me. It keeps taking too long for me to connect and then it says that there was a problem loading the page. I made sure to check around the forums before posting this question but it doesn&#039;t seem like anyone else is having this problem. Can anyone help me?

				Make sure you are using:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/<br /><br />If you can&#039;t connect, try changing TOR Identities. If it still fails, hit refresh until it works. It&#039;s working great for me, and I have a feeling their servers are getting HAMMERED right now.

				Been attempting to connect for about 3 or 4 hours now, I can get to maybe 1 page before it stops loading. So basically I can log in and thats about it.<br /><br />I am getting increasingly annoyed with this. Stop giving me that &quot;LOVE YOU SR DANKS FOR ALL YOUR HARDWORK&quot; bullshit. I thought they were FIXING these problems. I mean seriously you guys aren&#039;t google and you should stop acting like that. I don&#039;t doubt that maybe several thousand people are attempting to connect at most, are your servers really that shitty?

				look guy, you&#039;re right this isn&#039;t google, or any .com clearnet operation.&nbsp; Their servers exist on the Tor network, which simply doesn&#039;t have the reliability that traditional clearnet sites have.<br /><br />I have been using a single identity since the site came back up and it is flying for me.&nbsp; I mean this identity is like magic--I wish I didn&#039;t have to give it up when I reboot.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been logged in for a few hours with this identity and its going faster than the forums.&nbsp; It all depends on your *TOR* connection--it&#039;s not their servers.&nbsp; The whole reason for the downtime was so they could upgrade their servers, and they did (so DPR can get paid without his own servers bottlenecking his rate).&nbsp; But these guys can&#039;t upgrade the entire Tor network.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s like trying to connect to the site on a 9600bps modem and then blaming SR that their servers aren&#039;t fast enough.&nbsp; There&#039;s a point where it&#039;s out of SR&#039;s control.&nbsp; Also try rebooting your computer.&nbsp; That seems to work when switching identities doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; It might be all in my head, but it&#039;s worth a shot if you&#039;re that unable to connect.
