				Weren&#039;t there supposed to be sales on SR as this attack was going on, with DPR charging zero admin costs and asking vendors to amend their prices accordingly?<br />Just wondered if that was still the case after all the attacks. Though it&#039;s not looking good right now, connection is pretty weak but I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s probably a genuine massive inflow of traffic now that the sites working(ish) again

				I hadn&#039;t seen any listing affected by the sale to be honest... I don&#039;t know why but it didn&#039;t seem to work. I checked out 10 vendors and their prices were unchanged. I didn&#039;t really understand what was up with this &quot;sale&quot;..

				Whether you saw a difference in prices on vendor sites depends on their account settings.&nbsp; Those vendors who list their items with &quot;post commission&quot; pricing would have no change in the price of their listings.&nbsp; Those who list with &quot;pre commission&quot; pricing would have shown a decrease in the price of their listings that was their asking price only.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how most vendors choose to set up their listings, so I can&#039;t provide as much insight as I would like.&nbsp; I do know that my listing prices were lower during the sale because the SR fees were not added for that time period.&nbsp; Between the volatility of the bitcoin and the fairly nominal fees (some complex structure I would have to look up to tell you), the prices of listings didn&#039;t seem that different.&nbsp; But DPR was true to his word and suspended fees for those few days.

				When the site came back last weekend there was no Silk Road fees for vendors, therefore vendors were encouraged to lower their prices.<br />I would have lowered my prices a bit for the duration of the fee-free period, but like many other vendors I have been unable to login for long enough to change settings and listing prices.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping the issue is fixed once an for all in the next few days and they have another fee-free period then too.

				Yeah, it would be nice. Shame it happened around the time of these attacks.<br />Speaking of which, are we off again? SR pages haven&#039;t loaded in about an hour for me

				The if Atlantis is responsible it is working for them. I&#039;ve barely left SR&#039;s side in the last few days, just hoping for a breakthrough, we&#039;re getting there by the looks of it.<br />Much love to DPR and his team.<br /><br />PS. SR just briefly loaded for me

				After all the time and effort I wouldnt trip on a sale, he prob had to spend some money to fix this, or just in general took a loss, im sure I&#039;m not the only one that can see this.

				Yeah it isn&#039;t the biggest of issues right now jailbirdslanger, I&#039;m with you on that. Was just curious if it even happened with the site going down. I personally didn&#039;t see it, just the forum thread but someone did mention there being a banner at one point. But no I&#039;m not bitching over this :)

I didn&#039;t doubt DPR waived the commission but thought vendors readjusted their prices to make more profit or something similar. It made me not wanna order because I thought they manually readjusted their prices! Too bad I guess..
