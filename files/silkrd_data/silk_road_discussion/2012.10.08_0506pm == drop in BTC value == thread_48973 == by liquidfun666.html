				Bitcoin values fluctuate just like the stock market. Their values are constantly changing. You can view a history of their fluctuations at Mt Gox. They&#039;ll prolly return to their $12 value within a few weeks but again, sudden current events (authorizes shutting down sites, passing laws against virtual currency ect) can all change the price. Your best bet is try and buy the coins as close to purchase time as possible. Ive so far been able to buy all my coins and have my purchases made same day to avoid any sudden losses :)
