				I bought an assload of bitcoins, placed an order with (&quot;vicodin&quot;), a reputable seller with constant good feedback. <br /><br />He actually helped direct me where and how to buy bitcoins. Now he has disappeared. He hasnt responded to emails and doesnt looks like he&#039;s touched my order.<br /><br />My issue is: All my coins are tied up in this transaction. I can;t seem to cancel this for 4 days.<br /><br />What else can I do?

				i&#039;m new here also, i couldn&#039;t cancel mine until they did something with the transaction, but i think it means your money isn&#039;t gone yet, just a pain in the ass. the dude i&#039;m buying from hasn&#039;t responded to my messages, after finalizing, so he has my money. he comes up with excuses on his profile, says he took all his postings down due to a family problem, but then put some up and checks his SR account everyday. i&#039;m a bit pissed because my money is gone, and theres not much i can do, but don&#039;t worry, i don&#039;t think yours is, theres a way to cancel it when he does something with the transaction, or you could click contact us on the bottom of SR, i just ranted to them tonight

				If your order is in escrow you have no problem. When the vendor mails it, your order will appear as &quot;in transit&quot; and you will have to release your BTCs, if he doesn&#039;t within 4 days you can cancel your order.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t worry Vicodin has almost 100% with tons of orders, all you can do is wait a few days.<br /><br /><br />Good Luck.

				Everybody was a newbie.(so Uniwiz will be kind)&nbsp; Please you found the forum spend a few hours reading, and save some $$$.<br />Your vendor is highly rated, and possibly busy handling orders instead of worry PM&#039;s.<br />Learn to be patient, and find a few vendors you can trust.<br />Start small.<br /><br />If you go 5-7 days in processing, then worry.<br />A week is nothing really.<br />Our great 2 day vendors do put the rest to shame, but it&#039;s busy season.<br />You need much more patience for this game.

				Don&#039;t forget it s the holidays too, I&#039;ve received every order I&#039;ve place so far, some take longer than others, it might be coming from overseas, i was like that to my first couple of shipments. This isn&#039;t Amazon, that being said i bet they would love to get a piece of the action:) I&#039;ve had to contact&nbsp; SR and it took awhile but they fixed my concern, always try to find out as much as you can about a seller before buying.....peace......:L

				Just relax - 2 days is nothing. Start thinking in weeks: week 1, week 2, Problem!<br /><br />In the last 2 weeks, there have been 10k orders on SR, by 200 Vendors = about 50 orders per vendor. Each order has about 2 msg, that&#039;s 100 msgs. The pre Xmas/NY time is very busy.<br /><br />Even if you are worried about your order:<br />&nbsp;keep the msg polite,<br />&nbsp;sending 99 msg/day does not help<br /><br />merry Xmas!

				Ok, so I wait a bit.<br /><br />Next question. I paid for 2 day shipping on two orders from the same guy. I bought from this seller as the feedback was always described as same day turnaround and fast/accurate. <br />Thats about an extra 2 bitcoins per prder or 16 bucks.<br />How do I get a refund on that?

				just placed an order myself with express shipping to canada. i messaged him once last night asking a question before i ordered and then again this morning just after i ordered and have received no reply yet. im sure he is swamped with the holidays and orders but a little confirmation would be nice especially since it was not hedged and i have ordered the express shipping. not loosing faith though, i realize im impatient and that very little time has passed. ; ) looking forward to hearing back from vicodin and receiving my order. i&#039;ll be back for more if everything goes well!! : )&nbsp; i just had my first order from Pharmville refunded 2 days after it should have been shipped because they decided to stop shipping outside of USA. : ( i hope i have some christmas luck with my order from vicodin! i&#039;ll keep you guys posted and if vicodin sees this please give me a shout back to confirm my order. <br /><br />thanks. rasspects<br />

(2 day shipping is usual 2 working days, not counting the day it was shipped and not the day you received it)<br />4) If you are <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;a) happy, give him 5/5 and say what was good<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;b) not happy, send him a msg (polite, only facts, tell him why you are not happy - plz, read it a second time before you send it)<br /><br />There are 1000s of postman doing there best to deliver our stuff in rain, snow and cold weather, but there will be delays everywhere. Even if your vendor pays for the quickest service possible, it could be out of his scope.<br /><br />If your vendor is cooperative, he will find a way to make you happy. Do not forget, this is not amazon or ebay. Only if Buyer and Seller are working as a team this is working out.

				yea, i was definitely swamped. i went a whole day without logging on and this is what happens.&nbsp; orders / messages pile up and then it takes me an half hour to connect to TOR / SR sometimes and if i do connect, its slow as fuck and takes 15 minutes just to check a single message.&nbsp; although tonight the site and tor are going at full speed so now i am entirely caught up. this shit is a lot more work than most people think it is. We sellers are risking our freedoms to do this for users we dont even know. I have extreme anxiety about being involved with this, and sometimes wonder if there are secret agents who would assassinate me like pablo escobar for doing this shit.

				To Vicodin:<br /><br />You were awesome and the stuff is great!! I never mentioned you by name here, so you really didnt nd to answer here. Since we had conversed so freely and you had helped me get bitcoins, then I lost touch completely, it kinda freaked me out. AND it was my first buy. Now I have 5-6 transactions and am getting the hang of it.<br /><br />To all you newbies looking for great opiods at a great price,&nbsp; &quot;Vicodin&quot; is your guy!! Fast shipping too. I got my stuff on Friday after pre-finalizing it Wed afternoon. Simply Awesome.<br />And I gave him 5 stars on both transactions<br /><br />
