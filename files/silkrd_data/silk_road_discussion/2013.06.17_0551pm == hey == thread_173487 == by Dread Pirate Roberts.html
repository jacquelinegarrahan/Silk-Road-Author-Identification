				It seems like I only ever post on the forums when there is something wrong that needs to be addressed.&nbsp; Today, I&#039;m just happy to be here and wanted to let you all know that.&nbsp; I sincerely hope, wherever you are and whatever your current circumstances, you can join me in taking a deep breath, relaxing a little, and taking stock of our blessings.&nbsp; Just being alive and free is such a gift.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been an enemy of the biggest and most dangerous organizations in the world for some time now.&nbsp; At this point I&#039;m truly amazed and delighted to still be free and alive!<br /><br />Whatever amount of health each of us have, we can be grateful for that.&nbsp; Every person in our lives we hold dear, we can be grateful for them.&nbsp; I am grateful for each and every one of you in this community.&nbsp; Whether you found this place just yesterday, or have been here for years, I respect you for thinking for yourself and acting in your own best interest, despite what others would try to force on you.&nbsp; And I honor you as my fellow traveler as we walk this path together.<br /><br />So, to all the players in this crazy game we&#039;re playing: buyers, vendors, financiers, the leaders in the community, the mods and admins, the arguers and skeptics, the evangelists, the tech gurus, the post office, the open source developers and communities, all of the giants who&#039;s shoulders we stand on, the scammers, and even... no especially law enforcement and law makers...&nbsp; I love you all!<br /><br />I know the feeling isn&#039;t mutual in all cases, but still my love for you persists.&nbsp; It does because it comes from a deep respect for human life and for you as an individual.<br /><br />As always, it&#039;s an honor to serve you.&nbsp; See you down the road...

				It amazes me how capable, trustworthy, and principled our leader is. Qualities that are lost on 100% of people. Truly a man or woman that is one in a trillion. I could not have asked for better, Mr. Roberts. And it confounds me that, in my daily life, I might have passed, or will pass, you on the street as a stranger without a second glance. A testament to your facelessness; you represent an idea, not yourself or your own image. And so I&#039;d be perfectly content to walk past your physical form unnoticed, because your movement&#039;s effect on this world can not be credited to any one person. It can only be felt by everyone who perceives it.

One of the worst things about drugs being illegal is having to hide our identities, would love nothing more than to be able to catch up with some of you guys for a beer or a spliff, it&#039;s lonely being an honorable man sometimes. But with the help of you DPR, it&#039;s becoming more profitable&nbsp; ;)

I was upset at the fact when I hustled I had the best gear. At that time I was barely making ends meet, and hated paying top dollar for ok gear. I have built my network on the road, and my vendors all love me. The amazing vendors who also take care of my needs big Hug from me. The reason I quit is the reason I started all over again with SR.

				&nbsp;&quot;Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one&#039;s favor all manner of unforeseen incidents, meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now.&quot;<br />Goethe J.W. <br />....a Big thank you to DPR and the SR Community.... |Long Live SilkRoad|&nbsp; ;)

				Hey DPR,<br /><br />A few weeks ago, shortly after the DDoS bullshit you had to deal with, I and a few of my associates actually made a proper, real-life toast to the group of people involved in keeping SR alive (both the marketplace and the idea), and we toasted you personally as well.&nbsp; We were happily celebrating a large successful purchase through the Road, and the toast just necessary for us to put our gratitude where it was due.&nbsp; I never thought you would know, and you might not even read this post, but felt it was worth mentioning in this thread of yours.&nbsp; <br /><br />It makes me feel extremely comforted by the fact that you feel the way you do at this point in the lifetime of SR.&nbsp; Freedom Isn&#039;t Free, but you&#039;re the guy who paid the price for all of the rest of us--with all of your efforts, hard work, risks, problems, danger, whatever--you&#039;re the guy we all have to thank for the freedom we are allowed through the Silk Road marketplace.<br /><br />Your ambition, your vision, and your ideas have made their mark on countless thousands (or perhaps, millions?).&nbsp; For that alone, you should be absolutely satisfied.&nbsp; Add to that the gratitude of myself and everyone else who is a part of this community.<br /><br />Well done, sir!

Great concept and great people pulling it off and making it work, you will always get people trying to spoil it but it&#039;s much more then just a place to buy drugs it all depends on what you want out of the experience and there&#039;s a wealth of knowledge to educate people too which is always a good thing.<br /><br />LONG LIVE SILK ROAD !

				This community has extended my views on life. It provides sellers a great and safe way to start their businesses and enhance their opportunities to work in something they like following the fair rules of SR, and buyers to enjoy what they receive in the comodity of their homes. So I want to thank you for creating a friendly space for buying and selling products anonymously like marijuana and for being awesome, and to everybody for being great too (except the cops and scammers).<br /><br />Sadly I cannot meet you to give you a hug and share a beer wity you, but you will be loved and remembered forever.

				it&#039;s glorious to be alive, and free, to live in a world where we can still shape the future. thank you DPR for giving the gift of the silkroad to the world, taking violence out of a section of the drug trade and showing that the majority of us can be civilized human beings. finally my technical prowess can obtain me one of my great loves in life, psychoactive substances, in a day and age where society frowns upon them. I learned about SR way back, but never really believed it until I finally tried it. no longer do I need to ask around town and hope to find a legitimate connection, thanks to you and your crew. you&#039;re doing the world a great service, may god bless you and the silkroad.

You have our love and you know it, even though sometimes we are tough on you, judging and demanding all sort of stuff.<br /><br />You are a true hero for us, not because we can find all the substances in the world but because you made this community work, come together and cooperate as a family. <br /><br />I want to wish you personally all the best, a long and happy life and why not, a permanent place in the history books of modern age.<br /><br />Massive love and respect,<br /><br />Your faithful believer<br /><br />Adamiz

				My first, last, and only login to the forums since the seizure... +1 to DPR seems on the one hand grossly inadequate, though on the other hand perhaps the most fitting thing one could do as a farewell gesture.<br /><br />Most excellent DPR: though you will almost certainly never read these words, one hopes you can feel the outpouring of gratitude, support, affection, and deep respect directed toward you from all parts of the world. You are a modern-day folk hero, if ever there was one, in a world where heroes are no longer easy to find. May you be safe and well and confident that your efforts were not in vain.<br /><br />To every vendor, buyer, forum participant, moderator, administrator, and everyone else who participated, however briefly, in this strange and wonderful experiment: thank you and congratulations. We are all a part of history, and all players upon the stage of a world in revolution. When our children and grandchildren are learning about the unique role of Silk Road as they study the history of the Internet, of commerce, of the drug &quot;subculture,&quot; you will all be able to smile to yourselves and remember that you were there, that you helped make it happen. Be assured that the contribution of SR will continue to resonate for many years to come.<br /><br />It has been a pleasure and an honor and an absolute goddamn THRILL to have been a part of this thing! I can&#039;t wait to see what happens next! May we all land safely, and live to fight another day. Peace and God bless,<br /><br />-PtC
