				I am trying to find a better way to fund my SR operations than moneygram. I am considering using my bank account with dwolla but dwolla requires me to enter my social security number and other sensitive information. Can anyone give me some advice on the easiest, cheapest, most secure--or some combination of those--method for funding my account? is dwolla the best way to go given their required information?

				Localbitcoins.com. It is very handy if there are people near you selling bitcoins. :)

They offer an option for anonymous cash deposits through most bank branches.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only done this for smaller deposits, but i doubt larger ones would raise too many eyebrows. You do have to generate an account with them that is semi-legit (I believe a valid email is all that is required but I&#039;ve seen rumours about them flagging tormail accounts). So simply tumble your coins a bit from that account for the extra security and you&#039;re done.&nbsp; The only downfall of this method is the fees: $3 flat rate for the deposit from the bank, then a small percentage from cavirtex. Even so, not a bad deal.<br />

				Thanks for the suggestions guys, I still go through Gox but I might decide to change exchanges, anybody want to recommend an exchange, it looks like I&#039;m just going to have to bite the bullet and give out my social and name and a ton of other identifying info to dwolla, it isn&#039;t that big of a deal to me but I&#039;d like to know what you guys find most convenient. Is there a way to use one of the moneygram cards to fund directly to bitinstant online and not have to clear it at walmart. Basically go in load money unto a card come home and do everything from the computer instead of having to use that goddamn red phone. I think I hate that red phone as much as HST hated the mojo-wire and since bitinstant just changed all of this recently and I have never used moneygram before so I could use some advice on obtaining BTC now.<br /><br />
