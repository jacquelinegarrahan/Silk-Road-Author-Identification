				Sorry for the noob type post, but my mind is blown right now. I learned about the Silk Road several months ago, but never thought I&#039;d actually make a purchase here someday. I always thought it could never work. Well thanks to Ivory and a wonderful gram of molly that just appeared in my mailbox, my faith in the Silk Road is at 100% right now. Thanks so much to this awesome community, especially everyone on the forums where I basically lurked for a month to figure out how to make a purchase and who I could trust. So pumped right now! Definitely will be a repeat customer, everyone I know is really excited about the &quot;new dealer&quot; I met.

				AHHHHH the post buy bliss of your first SR transaction......you never forget your first time.&nbsp; Have a smoke and try it again.<br /><br />and you bought from a VERY reputable vendor so kudos to you for doing it right and lurking on the forums for some intel.

				I know what you mean. When my first bit came through I couldn&#039;t believe it! So nice, and cheaper than on the street! Long may SR continue!<br /><br />P.S. JackStraw, I love your username!

				Congrats, all the way!<br /><br />I am waiting to post a story similar to yours: my first successful transaction.<br /><br />Once I get my PIN reset, it&#039;s a wrap for these local cats.

				YES! Fellow newb here, and I have a similar story! ;D<br /><br />When I first heard about the SR, i thought it was too good to be true.&nbsp; <br />Even after countless hours spent researching its legitimacy, then even more time spent setting up an account and arranging the purchase of Bitcoins and learning encryption techniques, then even MORE time spent poring through the forums reading up on individual vendors&#039; reputations... I still had my apprehensions.<br /><br />But I finally placed several small orders with a few highly-regarded vendors and crossed my fingers.&nbsp; Today, when I opened the mailbox to find my first package from Dolfan, I couldn&#039;t believe it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The SR is fucking LEGIT.&nbsp; This community (and that&#039;s really what it is, a tight-knit community of like-minded souls) really truly is a dream come true for me, and it&#039;s all thanks to you guys!

				Just completed my first transaction, too...&nbsp; And it was perfect in every way.<br /><br />It&#039;s funny- logically, I knew that it should work, based on the research I&#039;d done on both the seller (Dolfan- thanks, buddy!), and on the mechanics of Silk Road itself...&nbsp; But on an emotional level, I&#039;m still in a state of disbelief.<br /><br />Just fucking amazing!

				I&#039;m still looking forward to my first successful buy.&nbsp; Hopefully within the next ten days or so.&nbsp; These Bitcoin accounts are a real pain in the ass to set up but, hopefully well worth it.

				After many successful deliveries.......I still can not believe my eyes (And senses from the quality) every time I see that package.<br />Just stay paranoid, and always be working to make yourself stronger/safer.&nbsp;
