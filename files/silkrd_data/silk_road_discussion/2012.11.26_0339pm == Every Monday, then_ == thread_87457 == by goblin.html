				Let&#039;s see, maybe it is unanounced scheduled maintenance. If it makes things better in the end, I guess I&#039;m for it, just as long as it doesn&#039;t take all day, what?

We have been living a life of relative luxury, if 15% downtime is the cost of that, then that isn&#039;t such a damn bad deal.<br />And I haven&#039;t seen any load problems as of late either, actually they all resolved during the last total blackout, at least for me.<br /><br />Perhaps you should find other deepweb drug markets to bother, oh wait...

That&#039;s good to know, right, your perception of SR&#039;s problem is then greatly exaggerated.<br /><br />Comes no good out of your aggression. I&#039;d even suspect you of being LE or a competitor. You&#039;re not very friendly or constructive in any of what you post. If you&#039;re neither, I simply feel sorry for you and hope you too come to realize this soon and strive for change as I&#039;m sure would be a great improvement for your life in general and relationship to those around you.<br /><br />I&#039;m on pretty much all day every day past month(s) now and often notice on the minute when downtime like this happens, it&#039;s not very often and not a big problem to me. I&#039;m ok to pay with some slow connection and occasional tech issues for added security. You too should try see more of the positive and try deal with the situation, or go elsewhere.<br /><br />I suspect LE/competitor or such..

BUT, someone out there can and if they see DPR isn&#039;t able to provide consistent service, they will. IF the problem continues I think we&#039;ll begin to see new TOR sites pop up to take SR&#039;s place.&nbsp; I love SR and I&#039;d hate to use anything else, but I&#039;ve already found myself ordering from BMR. Currently it&#039;s only during SR&#039;s downtime, but if SR continues to remain unreliable then who knows.
