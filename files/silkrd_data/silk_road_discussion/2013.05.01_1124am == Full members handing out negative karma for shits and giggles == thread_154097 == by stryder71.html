				I used to think the karma idea on this site was a good idea but now I&#039;ve received -5 karma because I wrote a post about staying loyal to silk road I think it&#039;s ridiculous. I got one person give me -karma because she &quot;had to read that long winded piece of shit&quot; and personally I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a good enough reason to hand out -karma. Clearly others read her comment and followed suit for a laugh.<br />This does not reflect my posting attitude at all, especially as my post was talking about checking out the other black market sites while SR has been down and how dedicated I feel to SR. It&#039;s quite disappointing when you pledge your allegiance to the website and as a result get -karma.<br />It&#039;s a bit of a bitch really.<br />So yeah, I hope people don&#039;t really pay attention to the karma cuz I don&#039;t want people not taking me seriously or thinking \i&#039;m a troll or something just because someone didn&#039;t want to do a bit of reading...it wasn&#039;t even that long anyway so I don;t know what her problem was.<br /><br />I&#039;m just saying look out for these stuck up, arrogant full members who think they can do whatever they like because they&#039;ve earned the right to...<br />They should be stuck back in the newbie section!

				That&#039;s kinda my point. I know this is getting me loads of negative. I just want to see how pathetic people are on here, genuinely thought we were living in a world of adults but the people that just want to click negative simply because they think it&#039;s hilarious that someone is wound up by it, they clearly need to get back on their meds.<br />But it seems I probably deserve it anyway because even though I feel a lot of validity in what I say and I try not to be offensive, I always get someone who is willing to have a go at me or tell me I&#039;m doing something wrong. <br />People on this forum can be pretty much up their own asshole.<br />Just trying to use this forum for its intended purposes but it seems some of the children on here just can&#039;t handle it

				Well people give out -karma because they don&#039;t agree with what you&#039;re saying, fin you annoying, don&#039;t like your avatar, think you don&#039;t say revelant stuff, etc. The most common reasons for negging though is when someone is advocating bad security measures or spamming and trolling, or saying something offensive.. <br />I also find it annoying to be negged when you didn&#039;t say anything offensive or something like that... Obviously when you make a thread like &quot;Why are africans legally retarded?&quot; you can expect a lot of flak :P (this thread actually exists).<br />Here&#039;s a +1 to make you feel better ;) not all full members are dicks.

				it seems to be a bit wonky, probably because everyone is trying to login.&nbsp; the americans are awake now.<br /><br />My first -ve karma was from a post I made in a scammer thread, someone went down the thread giving everyone bad karma.&nbsp; I was a bit surprised until someone explained that that&#039;s not unusual.&nbsp; Since then they&#039;ve just accrued and there&#039;s not much that can be done.&nbsp; Just think of it as a way to keep you well balanced (or something ;) )

				Regarding negative karma... Who gives a fuck? Internet points don&#039;t really affect me, I use the forums to post once or twice here and there and to see if any vendors are up to anything new or if there is any drama, like what happened with coachella420.

				Negative karma really isn&#039;t a big deal on here mintsmoothie. I thought it was at first, then I just mentioned it out of curiosity and merely mentioning it got me more negatives, then I decided to test the water. Now I couldn&#039;t give a fuck, it&#039;s just funny

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve received about minus 10 or 15 karma points in the last two days alone, and I always suddenly get a big jump in negative karma whenever I appear and start posting useful information. This pine can only attribute to LE or their hysterical supporters who imagine themselves very clever people. Keyword here is *imagine*.<br /><br />Some of my negative karma is indeed because some people don&#039;t like me. But that is ok. I have also noticed platypuses traditionally appear to be bizarre and are frequently just misunderstood, as befits creatures that are clearly from another world that have (organic) quantum computers for noses. When you get to know them, they are amicable and wonderful companions!<br /><br />At least half of it comes from the fact I post information that seriously damages law enforcement practices and better yet, their conception of the world. I am quite sure LE supporters or LE agents experience psychological trauma and start kvetching madly about SR when they understood how easy it is for us to run rings about them. They have so much egg on their face right now they look like bacon omelettes.<br /><br />So be proud of your negative karma! Sometimes it means the opposite of what you think. Bacon omelettes! Mmmmmmm, now pine is hungry.

				You will notice that in general people seem more than ready to dish out the negative points but stingey on the positive points.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t let it get to you too much.&nbsp; Also I take some of my negative points as a badge of honor because I know many of them have come from calling someone out on their bullshit.<br /><br />And Stryder I just gave you a +1 to mess with your plan (and for unfairly calling out your karma stats out in another thread).<br /><br />Edit: nevermind you&#039;ll have to wait 72 hours apparently I&#039;ve been giving out too much karma lately.

				I make all my decisions on SR based on someones Karma, if their neg is really high then I dont deal with them, this Karma means everything, its very important you keep your negs low, any one with high low negs or low high negs or medium low low high negs then its an automatic block, if you press F2 twice you will see that.......<br /><br />of course I&#039;m being smartastic !<br /><br /><br />Fuck the haters, live life, chew chewing gum :)

Don&#039;t feed the trolls.<br /><br />I give little credit to people who disregard things like grammar, spelling, coherent arguments, half-decent content or just having positive attitudes. But I won&#039;t &quot;discourage&quot; them. It makes me feel bad :(<br /><br />I&#039;ve made a lot of posts on this forum that are quite long-winded, but I try to keep every piece of information interesting and sometimes controversial, to keep attention on the topic full-winded, rather than just idle conversation with no direction. Even though a lot of my posts have been &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;controversial&quot;, I like to think I&#039;ve put a lot of smiles on peoples faces and gotten a few good yucks, hence the positive karma balance.<br /><br />But, I fucking love this place for it&#039;s very VERY welcoming atmosphere, friendly people, and most importantly, rules and protocols of the board that insist on being FRIENDLY and EMPATHETIC to every person, regardless of their obvious misunderstood approaches or incoherent blatherings. I like to know that I can say something stupid, but then apologise without fear of judgement or ridicule.<br /><br />I love this forum, you guys are really fucking nice. Just for that, +1 for everyone on this page.<br /><br />I&#039;m not even on drugs. Weird, right?

				I like to look at Karma as your K\D ratio in COD. Even the best players die sometimes, but generally most good players keep positive K/D ratios. <br /><br />And some players are simply n00bs getting pwned all day. <br /><br />Do they stop? No. Does it change how they play? Occasionally. Do n00bs get pwned all day? Absolutely.&nbsp; 8)

				Also, I just want to say (as I feel that was directed at me as well as other high karma members here), no I do not regularly post on the +KARMA thread, I all but abandoned it until recently. My +Karma has come from my posts, and what I presume from the fact that unlike a lot of members here I choose to F1 people rather than sling shit and troll. Also, I try to correct the disinformation that I find here to F1 build a more resilient, savvy forum base. The biggest threat to this forum has never been the police, it has been police masquerading as forum members, and us ourselves with our stupid, juvenile, in-fighting. I have merely chosen to be a tad more productive with my time here. Have a look at some of the members with a high neg/low applaud ration and you will find many of them are trolls. Masterblaster, phoboss, the list goes on.<br /><br />As to my negs, well, I&#039;ll thank Masterblaster who does everybody on +KARMA thread, Newbie section, and other places, as well as the dicks who go around negging the good ones around here. Yeah, the Karma .SYS is vital to have if it is used correctly, but there are many people who are just dicks. <br /><br />But to clear it up, not everyone with high Karma gets it from the +KARMA thread. I posted today and I posted about 3 days ago, and I received 2 + on each occasion as many do not give it out even they they post there. Apart from that, I can&#039;t even remember the last time and the time before that, I abandoned it a while ago for reasons that are irrelevant.

				haha im no doubt going to get smashed for this, but as my profile quote says..... ;)<br /><br />i am clearly living rent free in someones head. and i love it. means i really got to them... yes...... i got into their head on an anonymous drug forum / IRC (where im sure my troll began to obsess over me... )&nbsp; &nbsp;10 shill accounts to log in and out of to give me -10 every 72 hours... now thats dedication.. i cant even begin to wonder how someone can justify wasting that amount of time... lulz<br /><br />the rest of us bros and bro&#039;ettes are out getting our mack on, enjoying life..... while the trolls are making numerous shill accounts, wasting all that time posting useless crap to get to 100 posts, writing in captchas, all for the purpose of giving negative karma or shit stirring..<br /><br />karma does not mean anything unless you can see who gave it to you. and since they can stay anonymous, they will continue to dish out negs in order to boost their self esteem because they were bullied at school and have no friends...sitting in their room, while mommy tells them to get out of the house more hahaha.<br />or worse off, they are an adult, living alone, and spend that amount of time on the computer because they are to scared to go out and talk to people in person..<br /><br />i think deep down, all they want is some attention and maybe a cuddle. we should start cuddle a troll day ;D<br /><br /><br />/psychology 101 rant.<br /><br /><br /><br />big ups to the mods. keep on chugging :P

There is a shill who posted page or two back on this thread who is one of the ones going around negging people. No, I won&#039;t name her. She has had a problem with the Karma system since December and is trying to fuck it up by negging everyone. She is not my problem but I do not agree with what she is doing. As for YOUR negs scout, while not all have come from a single source ( ::) think about it for a second) and some of the people who have given you negs have had legitimate issues with you, yes, I am aware that someone has been giving you some every three days since about -5. I am not going to investigate it. There are others on single accounts who neg every 3 days certain people on a never ending cycle. And yes, of course I know who they are. And no, of course I am ot revealing them. It is not my problem. (I myself am targeted every 3 days by multiple accounts and so are others. Only on Silk Road forums....) <br /><br />As for Libertas... well... I hate for someone to discredit them (inadvertently or not, I don&#039;t know). Lib has received a shit load of +Karma because they deserve it. Pure and simple. Okay? And consequently, no negs yet from people who go around targeting people every 3 days as they never got a chance to finish schooling so they would learn how to deal with their problems rather than let it boil up. I pity these people. I feel like giving them a sandwich or hug or grenade or something. I tend to +K a lot of people in newbies as they are targeted the worst. But... the people who ae negging the newbies are not the same ones as the ones negging selected people every 72 hours. (And don&#039;t ask me to list them.)<br /><br />Anyway. This is one of those threads which you look at think, nope, not going to contribute. But in the end you do anyway. It&#039;s a car-wreck, you just can&#039;t stay away.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I&#039;m very new to SR and the forums. When I got my first neg, I was like wtf? Then I realized that not everyone has the same sarcastic sense of humor that I have. Then I realized that this is a 100% anonymous forum and it doesn&#039;t matter. Scout has helped me more than anyone else on SR, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not alone here. <br /><br />What I think speaks volumes about the integrity of this forum is the fact that the mods DO HAVE NEG karma. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s deserved, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a way for them to either change their karma stats (or have it changed thru an admin). This is in line with everything I&#039;ve seen so far on SR. Posts that are critical of SR are not edited or deleted from what I&#039;ve seen.<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys because in the end, the dedicated users of the forum KNOW who is helpful and who are TROLLS.

				Yeah, when astor and pine and SSBD are getting a huge influx of negative karma, it pretty much proves that something has seriously changed around here.&nbsp; One thing I&#039;ve learned though is that we seem to have seasons here at SR.&nbsp; This one will pass too and give way into another.&nbsp; Maybe that one will involve less craziness.

				I find it quite odd that some people operate a number of shills, I know most of us have done it at one time or another to troll someone or whatever but to actively operate several accounts as full members posting across the forums just seems a bit weird to me. I know multiple accounts are used to manipulate feedback in certain threads, those are normally quite easy to spot, the 3 post wonders chiming in with the glowing review after the previous 2 pages have been from very unhappy people. <br /><br />It is also interesting to hear that some people claim to know who is up to what, negging etc because I&#039;d be amazed to hear how they got that info when not even the admins or DPR can see who gives who karma, SMF does not support that feature. That would make those claims either total BS or perhaps their powers of perception are infinitely greater than mine, my tin foil suit protects me from the hidden agendas on here though so luckily I am safe.<br />

When you click thank/discourage on a post, the forum software knows which link you clicked. It lodges the karma but discards the info about the link/post. SMF is open source and could be modified to save that info. So someone could write a plugin that lists everyone who thanks or discourages a post, right next to the post. I suspect that kind of transparency would radically change the current ethos around karma, since it would quickly expose the shill hater accounts.<br />

Scout has been demolished with neg karma, that is a concerted campaign and nothing else. Interesting to see some people blowing smoke up the arse of Libertas saying they are not getting negged because they are earning their karma, well fuck me I must have strong armed mine then. <br /><br />There is some shonky business going down on here and I&#039;m getting a pretty good idea who is fucking with the system and yes I agree if it&#039;s being abused then it should be done away with along with all the shills.

It is if you don&#039;t mind me saying rather disingenuous of you to assert that certain opinions are conspiracy theories when you yourself claim to know who is running shill accounts and going around dishing out the negs every 72 hours, which if you read my posts is precisely what I have said. <br /><br />How about we leave it there&nbsp; ;)

I also noticed that back in January, that samesame &quot;forgot&quot; to get back to someone about a&nbsp; request to take down rape material. Initially, I thought that secretly someone approved of this -- let&#039;s not say who -- and wanted it left up. It was left to nomad to fix handle it.<br /><br />I feel sad that a representative of Silk Road, and one whom I at one time spent much time defending, has made an issue where there was none, I have no idea why they harness such hatred to a longtime member who has spent their time helping others, but hey, I guess people change and I while I cannot force people to do the right thing, I can fortunately decide who I spend time assisting. <br /><br />I also feel it downgrades the image of Silk Road for people to sling at a forum member behind the hat of a moderator, and aggressively and persistently provoke this member by choosing to gossip on this thread when they don&#039;t know the subject matter -- believe me, you are not even close -- at the expense of tending to more pertinent areas and helping people in need of attention -- that really is the role of a mod and something that I feel is basic.<br /><br />Best wishes for your health scout and hope that this issue, which I feel has been antagonized over the last several pages, will not further denigrate Silk Road further than it has today.<br /><br />As for samesame, I am sorry you have taken an issue with me, whatever it is, it is unfounded, but at the same time I have absolutely no intention of enlightening someone who told me I was a bullshit artist and manipulative to boot. I am sure you understand.<br /><br />Raz

The longer you&#039;re here the less you have to check posts, you get to know who&#039;s a troll, who&#039;s confused, and who really is in the wrong, a mod for doing their job or a troll who may be pretending to be slow n order to troll a mod and take up their time, and from what I see, possibly from a shill. If this was the first post of mine you read, you&#039;d prolly think I&#039;m a troll. In reality I&#039;m nice and supre friendly, but not to dicks who come here to cause trouble. He is not &#039;promoting awareness on a board&#039; he is promoting awareness of the fact he has a bit too much time on his hands and likes to twist things, thus actually contributing to spam by taking up time from those who delete it while they argue over this silly little issue of his, while at the same time provoking and antagonizing that mod. You choose who to put your support behind. But I see where you are coming from. Just see where WE are coming from though.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140059.msg953259#msg953259">Quote from: WhisteBlower on March 29, 2013, 06:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Aqua - if you want to blackmail him, more power to you.

Also, I already covered this, but scout is not some idiot who misinterpreted something and worked themselves into a &quot;frenzy&quot; over. I&#039;m sad to see I am the only one to see this but then again, I&#039;m the only other vet on this thread so far. So I have the benefit of standing back a little further on this issue. I don&#039;t doubt your intentions.

I seriously can&#039;t eat my dinner after thinking about this shit. You realize you are the worst kind of creature on this planet, and deserve to suffer.

Don&#039;t take up for someone like that. It is not ethical.<br /><br />We all done here?<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters<br /><br />[Edit. coffee gone cold while writing this. :&#039;( ]

				^^^ someone clearly has too much time on their hands.<br /><br />Thank you for finally showing your hand in what the issue is Raz, I suspected it probably went back to the Roky stuff, we exchanged PM&#039;s then remember? I told you what we had been instructed to do and I was the one who triggered the whole episode by editing and deleting Roky&#039;s some posts and threads.<br /><br />Shame you blame scout and I for that, why don&#039;t you try focusing your attention where it is deserved instead of blaming the mods.<br /><br />and down the rabbit hole we go........
