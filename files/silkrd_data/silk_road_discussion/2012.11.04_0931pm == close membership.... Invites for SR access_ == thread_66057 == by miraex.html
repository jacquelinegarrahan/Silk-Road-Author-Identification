				To me this seems like a good idea to introduce an invite system to prevent &quot;ghost&quot; accounts and FDA agents from gaining access to our holy grail. Each existing member would have to opportunity to invite 1 new person to our community every 3 months or something like that... anyone like this idea??

				This is an awful idea. You should assume that there are already plenty of LE on SR and on the forums. If you believe otherwise, or believe some arbitrary step would remove them from the site you are simply deluding yourself.

(LE, serious buyers, shill accounts, etc etc)<br /><br /><br />Having a BTC buyer account fee seems like the best option.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: ahh, I think I see what you mean.Vendors who use other vendors to convert their BTC? There are other ways to cash out, and one buyer account (unlinked to the vendor&#039;s account) is enough to get a good amount of cashing out done. Why does a vendor need a different buyer account everytime?

				I think personally, it worked fine for demonoid and plenty of other sites, why wouldn&#039;t it work for SR?<br /><br /><br />Or they could make a one time fee OR do like opiophile did and do MEMBERSHIPS w/ prices for a certain amount of times<br /><br />and this should apply to all existing and new members.<br /><br /><br />It just makes sense.<br /><br />

				Add a captcha for starting a thread. And give forum mods the ability to batch delete spam threads, so they don&#039;t have to delete them one by one like they do now. That would go a long way to clearing up the spam problem.<br /><br />And require new members to join the forums first before they&#039;re able to create buyer accounts. Require some minimal post count and educating themselves about the basics before they&#039;re able to sign up for that buyer account. That would go a long way to clear up issues of noobies letting themselves get scammed. The more members that fully engage with the forums and have read up on how to safely use SR, the less people there will be to fall for scams. The less people there are to fall for scams, the less incentive scammers will have to hang around SR. Over time we&#039;d likely see less scammers.<br /><br />But all this talk about fees or invites, I think they&#039;re all, maybe well meaning, but really unworkable, and possibly counterproductive measures. An invite system would: create a black market for SR invites, leading to just more scams, potential breaks in anonymity, and a whole host of other ills. And fees? First off, SR is a cash cow for it&#039;s owners. They don&#039;t need people paying for access. And it&#039;s a total 180 degree turn away from a founding principle of SR, which is to provide an open market place for otherwise illicit goods. And none of these would be better at alleviating the problems SR is experiencing than other, better alternatives.
