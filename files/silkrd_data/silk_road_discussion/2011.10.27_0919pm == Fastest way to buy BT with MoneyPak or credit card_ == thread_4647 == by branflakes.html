				I&#039;m looking to get about 15 BT into my SR account in the next 12-24 hours. I can get a MoneyPak but have a cc too. What&#039;s the best place to do direct MoneyPak/cc to BT wallet transfers? It seems like every site I find makes you go through a few currencies first. :-\

				I am just curious. How do you buy Moneypaks? Where and how can i purchase one?<br /><br />To answer your question look into get-bitcoin.com, they recently started accepting moneypaks.

				&nbsp;:D BTC Buddy and SumYunGai are the best btc exchangers imo. No particular order. BTC Buddy will soon be accepting credit cards. He already accepts PayPal and MoneyPak. And SumYunGai is just OFF the chain!! When he is on , he&#039;s on FIRE!! He accepts MP and helps w/ all kinds of monetary needs. He can not be beat imo.<br /><br />&nbsp;FUCK ALL those off site fuckers. ExchB is gone. get-bitcoin.com/who? NO WAY I&#039;d EVER use MT.Gox again!! Fuck um! Neither one of these two exchangers have NEVER ripped anyone off and always do there best to get BTC to you quickly. PLENTY on happy customers and TENS of thousands of USD has been transacted. No one is perfect but these dudes are close. Look on site for your needs. Do your research, read the forums, ask around, start a thread in the forums, be vigilant. ,&lt;-- run on sentence, lol. All your needs can be met on SR

				Sorry I&#039;m another one that can vouch for get-bitcoin, that guy works magic and has it in your account in an hour or less!&nbsp; As for getting a moneypak and giving it out on here, SumYunGai is the only one i&#039;d go with.&nbsp; <br /><br />Moneypak&#039;s are typically sold at CSV or walmart so just go with what&#039;s closest and call ahead to see if they have them in stock.&nbsp; best of luck and happy halloween!

				Thanks guys. I was able to get a MoneyPak at Wal-Mart. I almost got their gift card instead when I asked for it. Glad I double checked!<br /><br />Somehow I managed to get in on #bitcoin-otc and was helped out with handling a transaction.<br /><br />For those who aren&#039;t in the know about MoneyPak, it&#039;s much safer than PayPal. PayPal doesn&#039;t cover digital goods so a seller could send the BT and the buyer could issue a chargeback. With MoneyPak you just give the number on it to the seller who can redeem it. Unfortunately the MoneyPak cost $4.64!

				The other method of getting fast BTC is something the major exchanges have just started offering.&nbsp; If you are located in US, MTGox is offering direct bank deposits at several major banks.&nbsp; (Chace and another one I can&#039;t remember off hand)<br /><br />All you have to do is fill out the deposit form on mtgox and take it in with you when you do your cash deposit.&nbsp; No ID required.<br /><br />Cavirex in Canada offers the same thing, avaiable at RBC and CIBC branches.&nbsp; No ID required either.<br /><br />Best of all, if you do this in the morning the money is usually there in just a couple of hours.&nbsp; Takes the mystery out of handing over a moneypak number to someone and risking them not transferring BTC.

				If it&#039;s a new vendor, don&#039;t just wait for positive feedback - check the feedback to make sure it&#039;s not padding before the scamming starts.<br /><br />Insist that ANY exchange vendors put up a forum topic for people to leave reviews and make sure there are some established buyers and forum members posting in there.<br /><br />Otherwise I would be very leery...

				Yeah I think its safer to say, their best turnaround time would be 2-3 hours, and worst case scenario it really can take up to 24 hours so, no need to worry until the timeframe has exceeded 24 hours without any response from them via Email.&nbsp; Thanks for listing their forum thread for those looking for alternative methods *upvote*

				I don&#039;t think you can, but what you can do is buy bitcoins from a vendor with moneypak.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just a heads up, a great VISA/MC green dot card is https://www.greendot.com/greendot/getacardnow<br /><br />After you sign up they give you a temporary card and CVC that you can use IMMEDIATELY to load moneypaks on&nbsp; and when you get your permanent card they transfer the balance over to the new one.<br /><br />AWESOME.<br /><br />PEACE. 8)<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know if anyone has checked this one out yet...kind of interesting:<br /><br />http://bitcoin-otc.com/<br /><br />That&#039;s just the website, of course, you actually check out the different offers, and then meet up in irc .... I&#039;ve been lurking, checking it out, just to see how it works...it&#039;s pretty wide open, but without any real protection, other than the web-of-trust type of thing...if anybody has used it successfully, I&#039;d love to hear...I&#039;ll probably try to buy a few btc, just so I can post on it, on here, since we&#039;ve been having some troubles...but so far, for me, best to date, is get-bitcoin.com .... but this shit changes weekly on here, sometimes daily....:)

				I used bitcoin-otc for the first time last week when none of the SR moneypak exchangers were available. It was definitely the way to go and will probably be my go to place to exchange moneypak to bitcoin in the future. It took a little while to get the hang of the way the chat works with gribble and all but within an hour I was in communication with a imsaguy, an exchanger who others on the chat had vouched for and who gave me a better deal on bitcoins than I would&#039;ve gotten on SR anyways. I had to send my moneypak number and a photo of the receipt first so I was a bit nervous but all was well and he made the whole process super easy. There&#039;s certainly some risk involved but if you are smart and figure out who&#039;s reliable before making an exchange, I&#039;m sure everything will work out.

				seeing as the biggest obstacle for a single moneypak-btc vendor is that greendot is actively trying to prevent money-exchangers (since they are indistinguishable from money launderers), and high volume sets off their alarms, bitcoin-otc is not a bad idea. crowd-surfing the problem :) it will be interesting to see how that site evolves...<br />
