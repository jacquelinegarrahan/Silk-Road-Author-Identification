				I just did a Google search (via TOR of course) to learn more about something being discussed here on the forums, and was very surprised to find Google search results to actual SR forum posts.&nbsp; Looks like they&#039;re indexing the .to gateway.&nbsp; For example, search for &quot;Backup plans by Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; and I get http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=155554.0 as the second result.&nbsp; Is this new, or have I just never noticed it before?&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess that&#039;s to be expected, but it is sort of shocking to see at first...&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to think of this community as hidden and obscured when in fact it&#039;s all right out in the open!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Yeah I made a thread it about it to last night.<br />it seems most people a) dont understand how google indexing works and b) don&#039;t care because the forum is public anyways..<br /><br />I reckon that&#039;s pretty stupid. If people mistakenly use something they might use on other forums.. not even usernames, but signatures, catch phrases or even btc address.. obviously it would be stupid for someone to do this, but everyone makes mistakes.. anyways say you google someone&#039;s btc address in their signature (which in itsself is stupid to have on the forum, but people still do it..) you got from another forum and then it links them to here that isn&#039;t going to end well...... <br /><br />I don&#039;t do anything mentioned above and try to make myself anonymous from my other normal online stuff.. but i&#039;m sure heaps of people do not.. and it&#039;s bullshit to turn around and say the forum is public and people should know better.. they should, but again, everyone makes mistakes and the forum/site should at least do what they can to protect users.. even if the user brings it on themselves.
