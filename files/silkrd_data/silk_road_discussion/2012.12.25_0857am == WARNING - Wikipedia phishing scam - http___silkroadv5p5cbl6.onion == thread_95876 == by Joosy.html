Once you have given the sobs your PIN, along with your userid and password, they have all they need to clean out your account. <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to rub it in or anything, but did not the fact that the Silk Road site doesn&#039;t ask for your PIN at login, give you a clue that something was up? <br /><br />NC<br />

				Well the thing is the money I had on that account is still in the resolution process, I have 5 days until i wouldv&#039;e gotten the refund. Do I still have a chance of getting my account or money back since the money is still in resolution? I contacted SR support already.... But honestly I didn&#039;t think much of it...

				HA nice.&nbsp; so simple and yet so effective.<br /><br />cant believe people fall for this shit time after time.&nbsp; i&#039;d of thought a more simple way to not lose your BTC is to not keep them on the website and in a seperate wallet, just in case you are compromised. i personally only ever store my btc on the website for a matter of minutes before they are spent.<br /><br />

				i&#039;m not a very tech savvy person but i&#039;m gonna try to improve my understanding, so this might seem like a dumb question...<br /><br />if you create an account and store some sort of trojan file or virus as an attachment to a message on the inbox and name it as something of interest to a scammer, make it something related to PI or passwords etc. Then they access your account through information entered on their phishing site, and they download or opened the attachment?&nbsp; What would happen?

TrueCrypt can even be set to autorun when you insert the thumb drive.<br /><br />http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=truecrypt-portable<br /><br />I think this will be my next tutorial, because there&#039;s a big need for secure data storage in the community.

I went to the site last night, ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace) and the phishing link was there.&nbsp; Upon checking again, there is now no link to the Silk Road site. <br /><br />The fact of the matter is simple -- NO ONE should be using Wikepedia to lookup Silk Road URL information, PERIOD. <br /><br />NC<br />

				I didn&#039;t fall for the phish, but I did learn the hard way that when I update the Tor Browser Bundle, I lose all of my bookmarks. When this happened recently, I had to go find and then bookmark again all the sites I normally use.<br /><br />Now that I know about this, next time I will export my bookmarks before updating TBB. Afterwards I can import them back in and I won&#039;t have to look up the sites or risk accidentally ending up at a phishing site.
