				I get a JavaScript blocked icon whenever I&#039;m on SR. <br /><br />Does anyone have an answer why?<br /><br />If everyone is supposed to Tor with JS blocked, why would the site try to use it?

				He was asking why the site was using JS to begin with, the answer being because this site runs on Simple Machines Forum which uses Javascript. Another thing I thought wasn&#039;t supposed to be done was linking to the clearnet, but that&#039;s done right at the bottom of the page too.

				i dont get any java script blocked notifications in SR.....im not tech savvy at all though so cant really help....i found this interesting read today in regards to a cookie that uses javascript though....i found that super cookie in my registry so I fucking zapped it<br /><br /><br />&quot;&quot;&quot;Be wary also of Windows Media Player. It creates a unique ID number in the form of a 128-bit GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) which will uniquely identify your computer to the world at large. It is stored in the Windows Registry here:<br /><br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\WindowsMedia\ WMSDK\General\UniqueID<br /><br />This ID number can be retrieved by any web site through the use of JavaScript. Hence the reason why it MUST be disabled. The ID number is called a supercookie because it can be retrieved by any web site. This supercookie can be retrieved by any site to track you and web sites can share this information with each other, allowing them to create a sophisticated profile about your Internet usage. Worse, cookie blockers cannot block its use!<br /><br />If it has already been created, then you should delete that key from your registry, if you know how to access your registry. Take care! &quot;&quot;&quot;

				There&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with a Tor site using JavaScript, as long as it works without it. (That&#039;s my philosophy for clearnet sites too, actually.)

				The issue with javascript and other external programs/extensions, is that it can destroy your anonymity by pulling information from clearnet, or even when asking you to &quot;update&quot; you connect your real IP. <br /><br />Its just a bad practice to allow javascript on a tor site, BUT if the site handles the javascript correctly/safely, its not really a concern. <br /><br />I would trust SR with some javascript, but trusting anything on these markets is a concern.&nbsp; So - Just disable your browsers javascript functionality altogether, and forget about the notices =-)
