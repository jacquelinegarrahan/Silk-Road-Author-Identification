				at least it&#039;s open source so people can inspect the code. <br /><br />Also, whatever it was that made you so high that you read software TOS, I may want to try as well :)

				I think people should just be aware that anything you do on this forum or anywhere on the net can be read or leaked to people you may not want to read what you write. Security is a personal responsibility and no site can be trusted.

				I believe what Rake was getting at (not to put words in your mouth) was anyone can sign up to this forum, so you still have to be careful what you say in case you drop yourself in it. Just work with the idea that there ARE LE on these forums going through every single post just waiting for you to give a little too much information away. I think its the best practice here.<br /><br />
