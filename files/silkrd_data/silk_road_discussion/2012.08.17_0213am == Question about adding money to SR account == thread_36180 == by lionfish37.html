				OK guys this bitcoin thing is a bit confusing I opened an account on MT.Gox and have added money there. How do I send it to SR account. Very new to this and wonder why we can just buy bitcoins on SR? Transfer fees are a huge waste. Any help?<br /><br /><br />Thansk

				Don&#039;t buy BTC on Silk Road, you will get scammed!<br />After you&#039;ve got the money in Mt Gox, you can use it to buy Bitcoins (BTC). When you have these, click on withdraw funds, and select BTC from the drop down menu. There&#039;ll be two boxes, one for the amount of BTC to withdraw (send), and one for the address. You can put your Silk Road account address in there to transfer here directly, but general consensus is to run them through a tumbler service, like Bitcoin Fog.

				Personally, I like bitfloor.com.&nbsp; They allow you to simply walk into a large handful of bank branches and deposit cash.&nbsp; I have yet been asked to provide any kind of identification when I deposit cash at a teller.&nbsp; You simply fill out a deposit slip, put in the exact amount of money their website provides you when you setup a deposit, add their account number and name.&nbsp; And then ask the teller to validate the account number and name are accurate when you hand them the cash.<br /><br />Another trick is never buy at market.&nbsp; Use the tools to set limit orders.&nbsp; The less you limit, the faster your trade, the more you will pay :)<br /><br />And, you can also join the IRC channel #bitcoin-otc on the network irc.freenode.net, and offer up pretty much anything in exchange for BTC :)&nbsp; Just have manners, remember the PLUR, and offer a goat and see who responds!&nbsp; I have used this in trading currencies from other virtual worlds quickly and easily, and typically right at the current spot price for BTC.<br /><br />With the first, start your approach win bitfloor using a TOR services for mail and identity from the start, always use it from TOR.&nbsp; The second is a trading service like Silk Road itself, so always treat it like you would the road, build and drive all interaction from that TOR VM and never given up any real life details.<br /><br />These are just my own opinions btw.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Anjin<br />

				Bitfloor, I like it.... Does anyone know the some banks they use? I want to make sure their is one by me. I don&#039;t see how this would be a secret, or bad Q... if is, never mind.

So it&#039;s not entirely risk-free.

				&quot;Please be patient, it may take a few hours for the Bitcoin network to confirm the transaction.&quot;<br /><br />How long does it usually take to transfer funds into a SR account?<br /><br />I used BitInstant...
