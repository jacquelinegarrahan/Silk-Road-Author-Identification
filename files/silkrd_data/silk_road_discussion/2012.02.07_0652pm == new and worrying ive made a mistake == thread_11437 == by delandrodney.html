				&nbsp;:-\<br />hello to all, im new to the silk road community and if all does whats claimed on the tin (ordering special goods to your doorstep) i can only wish id found it sooner, however i have placed a few orders with different people, and now 2 days after placing the orders neither of them have been shipped. is this normal and im just being an inpatient twat? or should i hear alarm bells ringing?<br /><br />one more question being.. to my understanding all orders have to be finalized by the buyer before the bitcoins are transfered to the sellers account, so if i wasnt hearing back from sellers that ive placed orders with but havnt finalized, how would i go about reclaiming my coin?<br /><br />would very much appreciate some insight from a more seasoned buyer of the silk road community<br /><br />

If you&#039;ve ordered domestically it often arrives the next day but usually within a few days. If you&#039;ve ordered from another continent it will generally take at least a week.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11437.msg106534#msg106534">Quote from: delandrodney on February 07, 2012, 06:52 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">one more question being.. to my understanding all orders have to be finalized by the buyer before the bitcoins are transfered to the sellers account, so if i wasnt hearing back from sellers that ive placed orders with but havnt finalized, how would i go about reclaiming my coin?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />After a few days a &#039;resolve&#039; link will be enabled and you&#039;ll be able to propose a resolution (e.g. refund or resend) to the seller and a mediator (SR administrator). If the seller disputes your claim and can make it plausible that he has sent the order then you&#039;ll probably only be partially refunded (e.g. 50%); it&#039;s possible that the order &#039;got lost&#039; in the mail or that the buyer tries to scam the seller.<br /><br />See also: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Escrow

				I&#039;m also new and I forgot to encrypt/privnote my address. I contacted the seller (highly rated) and he hasn&#039;t responded. Is my information vulnerable? What can i do?<br />Thanks in advance.

				keep in mind we&#039;re still in the aftermath of a pretty big event, sellers might be fairly swamped, give it a bit, read around some more<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11437.msg106700#msg106700">Quote from: whitef1re on February 07, 2012, 09:25 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m also new and I forgot to encrypt/privnote my address.

There&#039;s not much the vendor can do if you chose not to encrypt your address - it&#039;s on SR now unencrypted, end of story.<br /><br />But it&#039;s a minor error really. The advantage of encrypting is simply that no matter what happens (SR bust, infiltrated etc), only you and the vendor will be able to read it. <br /><br />Encrypt it in future - it&#039;s an extra security step you can take to protect yourself.<br /><br />Assuming SR doesn&#039;t get busted in the next couple of days, you&#039;ll be fine because your address will disappear off SR once the vendor changes your order status from &#039;processing&#039; to &#039;in transit&#039;.<br /><br />What the vendor does with your address at his end is up to him. We assume and hope they put it on an envelope and then destroy all further evidence of it, but who knows?
