				Hey everyone I&#039;m really new to this and have read through the stickies here and tried to figure this out on my own so sorry if this is a dumb question.<br /><br />tldr: Went to SR /account page and entered my own SR address in the &quot;Withdraw Bitcoins&quot; box. Now all 7.12 bitcoins I had in my SR account are gone, is there any way to get them back?<br /><br />I originally started with 7.12 bitcoins showing up in my account.&nbsp; <br />I tried to order a product. I added it to my cart, clicked the postage option and update so that it showed the new total amount. It was only 5.00, so I assumed I had plenty of bitcoins to fund it.&nbsp; <br />I encrypted my message and pasted it into the message box.<br /><br />I entered my pin # and clicked the order button.<br /><br />Next I was redirected to my SR/account page, and had a little message by the &quot;Withdraw bitcoins&quot; box that said &quot;Error: Try logging in again&quot; or something along those lines.<br />My shopping cart still contained the product I had just tried to order, and my account still showed the full 7.12 bitcoins like nothing had happened.<br /><br />I had the bright idea that maybe I needed to withdraw my bitcoins again or something so they would be put into escrow, so on the SR/account page I entered my personal address that was showing up below the &quot;To deposit bitcoins, send them to this address:&quot; line, and entered it into the &quot;bitcoin address&quot; box.<br />I entered the full amount and my pin, and then hit withdraw.<br />Now I only have 0.03 bit coins in my account! <br /><br />Does anyone know how I can recover these coins? I used my own address to withdraw them, so shouldn&#039;t it just create a feedback loop where the coins are withdrawn from myself, back into my account?<br />Thanks for any help, I realize what I did was probably incredibly stupid.

				Wait a few hours and they should be back in your account. If they don&#039;t show up after 5-6 hours message SR support and tell them what happenned, they will be able to sort you out.

				Just checked again and they&#039;re back! Thanks for the response, I guess I should have just been patient but I panicked.&nbsp; Any idea on what I did wrong with the ordering - why it redirected me to my account page when I hit order?<br /><br />I realize this topic may be more appropriate in the Technical Support but it looks like its being overwhelmed by spam at the moment.

				When it gives that error, you just need to log out and log back in then try the order again. Exactly as the error message says.

				I just had this error but it was from entering the wrong pin. I logged off, logged back in and placed my order fine.

Part of the &quot;security&quot; of Bitcoins lies in the fact that they are &quot;one way transactions&quot;. No charge backs. No &quot;refunds&quot; Nothing, unless the person that &quot;owns&quot; the address on the other side sends coins back to you. You got luck. This time.<br /><br />Always be doubly sure of where you are sending coins, when dealing with direct BTC addresses. I can&#039;t even tell you how many times I double and triple check a BTC address.<br /><br />I normally photographically memorize the first 4 characters and the 4 ending characters of any BTC address im sending too. Triple check, then send! :)<br /><br />I learned my lesson the hard way, donated about $300 in BTC to some random SR users wallet. There is nothing SR admins could have done, even if they wanted to.<br /><br />I digress,<br /><br />Be careful! ;)<br /><br />Welcome to SR.<br /><br />[shamlessplug] I have a &quot;beginners bitcoin ebook&quot; that I vend here on SR (can&#039;t get on right now as the site is acting silly at the moment, but I honestly implore you to consider taking a look at it. There is a lot of good stuff in there! [/shamelessplug]
