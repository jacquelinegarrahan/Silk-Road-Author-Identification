				What happened to the buyer? Did he just disappear?<br /><br />One of the worst things as a vendor.... is when a buyer sends....let&#039;s say 5.... messages asking you all types of&nbsp; questions that are already answered on our vendor page, then tells you thanks for sending the package off so fast, and tells you they can&#039;t wait for it. Then the day comes they actually receive their package and all of a sudden they are MIA. They don&#039;t log into SR. You send them a courtesy message after a few days and.....nothing. It go&#039;s unread. We can&#039;t go to the forums and start asking where so and so is. We can&#039;t post what happened and ask for help. We can&#039;t do a fucking thing but wait.<br /><br />Then the buyer comes back in a week of whatever( even 3 days sucks)( fuck even 1 day sucks) and says &quot; I&#039;m sorry I forgot to finalize, Ill do it now&quot;. They act as if it&#039;s no big deal. (sometimes things happen, say they can&#039;t log in or whatever. (I am not talking about those times). <br /><br />There are some post in here about how a vendor does not process their order for a couple days or takes a week to mail it or something along those lines. I understand that is really shitty and a terrible thing for the vendor to do. They even make it worse when they do not respond to or send a message to the buyer with an explanation. I don&#039;t think that should ever happen. And when that does....the buyer comes right in the forums and asks what they should do.. and usually, if not always, the poster uses a fake name or it is the very first post the buyer has made I feel for that buyer and I think it totally sucks and I understand their frustration and reason for posting. I have commented on this many of times and I am always on the buyers side and think that a vendor should never ever do this. Of course I am not talking about the very rare times something has happened to the vendor. But that should be very, very rare.<br /><br />There is never a reason a vendor should take more then 48 hours to ship out your product(really 24 hours). Unless of course the vendor post on his vendor page that orders are taking a few days to ship or something along those lines. I also think every vendor should tell you when your package will be shipped out&nbsp; such as within xx amount of hours after your order was placed. At the longest it should be the next business day. They should also post on their vendor page things such as if your order is received before say 2pm then it go&#039;s out that same day and if not the next day.(of course Sundays do not count). It should just be crystal clear in the listing and on the vendor page how long it takes the vendor to actually ship your package. I know a lot of vendors do this already. But it is one thing to say it. They need to follow their own policy&#039;s 100% of the time. NO EXCUSES.<br /><br />That&#039;s as long as it should ever take(24 hours)...assuming the vendor has&nbsp; no problems.&nbsp; Also if it does happen that it is taking longer then the vendors posted time, the vendor should be in contact with the buyer and explain to them EXACTLY what is going on and when their package will hit the mail. It is TOTAL bullshit when a vendor does not contact or ignores messages. As a vendor that should never happen. We have a higher standard then the buyers. <br /><br />Another thing that should never happen is a vendor marks &quot; In transit&quot; and it is not . That means they should never ever mark it in transit until it actually is. Not on the way to the post office but AFTER they already went. This is a must and it should be done every time. No need for laziness. And no excuses.<br /><br />Now SR gives the vendor 4 days. After that you have the shipping time that is out of our hands. I had a buyer purchase at 4pm on a Tuesday and he received it on Thursday and he just paid for my normal shipping and he left feedback that said &quot; it arrived in 2-3 days muh&quot;. First it was 2 days and&nbsp; you should always leave feedback that is100% accurate. And there is a big difference between 2 or 3 days. Though both are great for the record&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />But my point of this post was not about me and that particular feedback. It is about how buyers get on here and complain about a vendor taking to long time to process an order. I have already agreed with that. I think it is total bullshit and I would never and have never done that. My feedback proves it. I think I see a post about that&nbsp; every 3 or 4 days. And I am fine with the post and think the vendors should be called out. Especially if you are messaging them and they are not returning your messages.And I am sure when that happens they feel hopeless and are just looking for answers. So if that happens and the vendor is ignoring you or not returning messages and it has been past 4 days then post away.<br /><br />But if the vendors were to make post about the buyers not finalizing within a day or 2 these forums would have no other post! Yes there are plenty of great buyers. In fact most are. But there are a lot more buyers by % that don&#039;t finalize or take forever then vendors that take to long to process your order.<br /><br />Now just like the vendor... the buyer can take 24 hours to do it. But not doing it is complete bullshit. Now shit can happen ... I get that. But taking more then 24 hours is horrible and not doing it all and letting it auto finalize should get you banned. The sad thing is that you can easily just get a new account and so banning the buyer is not an option. It is on your stats. And one of the, if not the, biggest flags for me is the auto finalize percentage. If it is anything other then 0% I won&#039;t vend to you. It is more important then you refund rate IMO.<br /><br /><br />Obviously it is not all buyers. And&nbsp; most of you are great. But trust me, buyers do it 1000 times more then vendors that take more then 24 hours to ship. Another terrible thing is the buyers that send all those messages and are so nice before the package is shipped. Then they receive it and they vanish. It is the main reason vendors do not want to vend to new buyers. A lot of new buyers don&#039;t finalize fast.<br /><br />We don&#039;t make post about it because as vendors it is just part of the job. We all have to deal with it. But we all hate it. And it really hurts our business.<br /><br /><br />So bottom line is this..... When you receive your item get on SR just as fast as you did to purchase in order and finalize. It wouldn&#039;t hurt to send a &quot; thanks I received it and I left feedback&quot; message. Seems simple and a lot of you do it. But so many don&#039;t. <br /><br />With this current feedback system we can&#039;t comment on the&nbsp; feedback you leave. I make a habit of thanking the buyers for the feedback they leave. And I am sure other vendors do that to. But in a perfect buying experience the buyer would send me a message right before (as in minutes before) they make an order giving me a heads up or asking me questions that they may have about the order they are about to make. Not 2-3 days before. This is a terrible message to get &quot; Hey I am going to order in a few day&#039;s&quot; Don&#039;t send that message.<br /><br />But sending me a message right before you order or right after if you are a returning customer is a great idea. Then the day you receive it, sending another quick note telling us you got it and commenting about your package is nice also. I know you believe leaving feedback is doing that. And that is ok but it is not ideal. There may be some things you leave out of the public feedback that you could say in the message. OR just a simple thanks.<br /><br />&nbsp;Since I believe leaving feedback is for you to comment on how long it took the vendor to process the order, how long shipping took, how the packaging was, how the communication was, and how the product is (just my opinion and this could be a whole other thread) sending us a quick not is always nice. Sometimes it is so not needed. That I understand.<br /><br /><br />Communication is key. And it is important for the buyer to finalize as soon as they receive it. Just as it is important for the vendor to process and ship your package as soon as they receive it.<br /><br />Letting your order go to auto finalize is the worst thing a buyer can do. Or just about the worst.<br /><br /><br />Sorry for the rant. And sorry OP you are having that problem. SR is not perfect. But it is pretty fucking great!<br /><br /><br />See Ya!

				I&#039;m in the same boat, I have 3 orders that have auto finalized and they&#039;ve been processing for days, I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s a bug since the upgrade because it was much quicker in the past.<br />It is one the few downsides to being a vendor, I bust my ass getting orders out as soon as humanly possible and it&#039;s really disheartening when it is then allowed to auto finalize and you know it&#039;s been delivered.

				I have only been a vendor for a week or so and I have orders waiting to be finalized.&nbsp; I used DCN so I know they got accepted, so it is very frustrating just waiting to get the bitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve also got one order that needs to go to &quot;auto-finalize&quot; from &quot;processing&quot;.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried PM-ing the guy to see if he received the package - but no reply at all.&nbsp; At least it was only a small order, but it&#039;s still annoying. Should someone make a Post in the &quot;Technical Section&quot; of the SR Forum?
