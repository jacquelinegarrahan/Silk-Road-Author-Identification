				Hello. If you&#039;ve done any postal company research, you may have heard that they&#039;ve been massively shrinking, for mail is almost never used anymore. It&#039;s mostly packages, bills and advertisements. However, it&#039;s the packages that rack up the most money. <br />But guess who&#039;s sending all the packages. Amazon, Ebay and Silk Road. There are a few others, of course, but those are the most bulky ones. If the government is ever able to shut us down, the entire postal service would break down. It would be a disaster causing thousands of people to lose their job, not to mention a decent chunk of revenue would be eliminated entirely. This balance of events will allow Silk Road to flourish, no matter how much pressure they put into it. They might still try to get sellers, but they can never bring down the site entirely, for their own good.

				SR is maybe, AT MOST, 1% of the postal volume... if you take a year&#039;s worth of their activity and compare it to a day&#039;s worth of EBay OR Amazon. This is retarded, wrong, and not based in any kind of fact. Multiple billion-dollar companies compared to a 22-million dollar blackmarket? Yeah, no. Doesn&#039;t work like that.

				Actually, the volume of people posting drugs has gone up mainly due to the new technology.<br /><br />A buddy in another part of the nation lets you know he has some good shit. <br /><br />If he or she is a buddy then they will be polite and send a little your way!<br /><br />It does give opportunities for people in poorer nations to get the worth of the product in Western cash.<br /><br />SR does contribute to the economies of many nations. Small scale but imagine a future in which drugs were marketed online and all orders tracked and insured. If this was legal we would have 10,000 new members per week. It would be bigger than Amazon but of course, the prison industry would lose out big time as 90% of people in jail are there for drugs, use, sale and possession. Granted some people are involved with drugs and are violent nasty people in it for a profit. If drugs were legal violent psychopaths would not be controlling local street level conduits. Cartels would be competing with Roche Cocaine HCL.<br /><br />Making drugs illegal creates FEAR. Fear of arrest, fear of losing homes and property, fear of losing children as even cannabis is now reason to get social workers nosing about IF you tell them about it!<br /><br />Fear keeps people in line.<br /><br />Laters!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)
