				Are the rankings below our user names based off of post count?&nbsp; <br />Also, anyone else here rather bummed that they can&#039;t give karma yet?&nbsp; Definitely trying to get my post count up there&nbsp; ::)

				I would suggest that if it&#039;s possible we could find the posts that people get up and down voted on. Just like click on a user&#039;s karma and it goes to a page that lists the posts that were rated. I only have 1 karma and it&#039;s negative but the post I&#039;m sure got down voted was in the rumor mill on an lsd thread. A dude got ripped off by some vendor claiming some number ug dose when it wasn&#039;t even close. Everyone was saying &quot;3/5 is too low, be happy you got your product at all&quot; I disagreed because no one would stand for it if you bought 3.5g of weed and got 2.5 or 1.75. Would 3/5 be too low for that? Absolutely not. Anyway, I got negative karma for calling the guy out for advertizing bullshit numbers. I don&#039;t think it accurately portrays what happened but oh well.<br /><br />TL;DR A nice feature would be able to click on a user&#039;s karma and find the posts that were given both pos and neg karma.
