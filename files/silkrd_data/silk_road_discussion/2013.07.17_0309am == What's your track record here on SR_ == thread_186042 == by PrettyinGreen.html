				So, I became a full member of the forums today, and that gave me pause to reflect on my time here so far.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been on SR over a year and a half now, and completed 30+ orders.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned how to get bitcoins in various ways, use pgp, found some really good vendors, and learned how to spot and stay away from the bad apples.&nbsp; <br /><br />My very first order, like a clueless newbie, I FE&#039;d and I was scammed, along with quite a few others, by Toyotaman.&nbsp; After that happened, I wasn&#039;t sure what to think.&nbsp; Being sorely disappointed and having lost money, I wasn&#039;t entirely convinced that the whole thing wasn&#039;t just one giant scam.&nbsp; But, having learned my lesson, I tried again.&nbsp; Since then, I&#039;ve only had one order that did not arrive, on which I received a refund after going to resolution, and maybe 3 or 4 other orders that were canceled by the vendor or SR Support after they were either not shipped or the vendor went AWOL.&nbsp; <br /><br />So in all, only about 5 orders that didn&#039;t work out.&nbsp; After years of buying and selling on places like Ebay, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s too bad, especially considering the nature of SR.&nbsp; What about you, fellow roadies?&nbsp; I&#039;m not asking for specifics from anyone, just curious if most of you have had a relatively good experience in your time here.&nbsp; <br /><br />And a big thanks to DPR for creating and continuing to stand by Silk Road!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-*

				I started out back in september. I heard a rumor that some &quot;computer genius&quot; kid in my hometown was using some crazy website to flood our town with molly. I&#039;m kind of a nerd and know a little bit about computers, so I figured I should see if i could figure out how to use the site for myself. Finding the site was easy enough, but I had to have an old friend teach me how to go about buying bitcoins. Once I figured the whole thing out I was surprised at how easy the process was. Computer genius my ass! Anyway, after that I placed two orders back to back to my home address, unencrypted. The entire week that I was waiting for my packages (two 5 strips) I was scared shitless. Everytime my house phone rang, I was like &quot;holy shit this is the cops they caught me&quot;. Also I lived with my parents at the time so I was even more nervous that one of them would question or open the packages. Nothing happened though, and both packages arrived safely. One of my 5 strips was from Enterthematrix though...fuck that guy. As time went by I became more and more bold with my ordering, and not one time did my rental units question the packages that came, however i would still get a little nervous whenever ma or pa got the mail the day i received a package&nbsp; :-\. Eventually, I got an offer from a technologically illiterate friend to order some bulk product for him. I decided that I would do this, but I promised myself that I would up my game in the anonymity department. I decided that before I ordered this package, I would do two things, set up a P.O box at a nearby post office, and learn PGP encryption. Since nobody I knew in person knew how to do encryption or P.O box shit, I had to figure it all out by myself, which was quite a daunting task. I resorted to using the forums to find out how to do both things. It took me about a month, but I&nbsp; eventually figured out how to do everything. I was (still am) VERY proud of myself for figuring out how to use encryption. I was very nervous about my P.O box though, as i thought the box itself was rather small, and I was nervous that one of my packages wouldn&#039;t fit and I would have to go up and sign for it, or that the postal employees would catch on to what I was doing. My fears were for naught, however, as every time a package doesn&#039;t fit, they just give me a key that opens a bigger box with the item in it. I&#039;m so comfortable with my set up now that I walk up in that post office everytime like a BAWSS! Funny thing is, my friend changed his mind about ordering bulk like the day after i had set everything up haha so I never ordered anything. I have ordered some slight bulk since then though. Anyway, thats the story about how Mr.X went from a lowercase x, to a capital X. I&#039;ve spent about 3k so far and feel i have only been ripped off one time. Next up on my SR to do list, is perhaps learning how to use liberte in order to become completely anonymous. Cheers to all my fellow &quot;geniuses&quot; muahahahahahah

				15 orders in three months and only 2 haven&#039;t made it, mostly all mdma. One was a free sample, and the second one was a free sample that I paid only for shipping. Needless to say, I won&#039;t waste my time with free samples any more. All of my orders have been decent size orders and all overseas as well. <br /><br />I have a pretty good system in place to avoid CD&#039;s as well. Mailmen are not allowed in my apartment complex, security accepts and signs for everything. I can leave a package that requires a signature with security indefinitely, so if that ends of being the case, I&#039;ll leave it alone for a few months and let LE jerk off while they wait for me to grab it, but eventually give up. If they refuse to leave it with the security desk and make me pick it up in person, well then it&#039;s no doubt a CD and I&#039;ll take my loss.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been surfing the silken road since the summer of &#039;12. I can&#039;t quite recall how I heard about it, but no one, not even the more &quot;established&quot; dealers in my area could even imagine such a thing; An ebay for drugs, weapons, chemicals, forgeries, and other contraband, using a semi-anonymous digital currency that ships to your address, operating right under the noses of our mighty DEA/FBI? Nonsense. An impossibility. <br /><br />I was still skeptical, but I decided to go for it anyway, and settled on a small order of cannabis (4 grams) as my test... I had previously used PGP encryption, so I knew the basics, checked the forums for any bit of info I could find on the vendor in question, and then went off to collect bitcoins through a local dealer who just happened to be relatively close to my location and also legitimate.<br /><br />A week later my order arrived stealthily enshrouded in a way that still makes me grin whenever I think back to it. I would reveal more about how it was disguised but I believe that goes against SR policy..<br /><br />Since then, I&#039;ve made relatively few orders over the past year or so (only 5), as I&#039;m a personal buyer and do it solely for experimentation -- specifically hallucinogens/psychedelics that aren&#039;t locally available or are of questionable purity.<br /><br />So far, no scams and no lost packages. I&#039;m thankful :)

				I have been on here for some time, never scammed. Vendors have attempted to scam I, but I will always research elaborately on deals that seem too good to be true. And thanks to the forums have eluded scammers. I wish more would use the forums for scam prevention. Recently I had an issue with a vendor, he forgot to send a package due to personal issue, I was his first order and it was 30 days late domestic, if that happend on ebay I would be angry, but&nbsp; it&#039;s the Road and you have to look out for the community and be understanding. <br /><br />I love this place :D

				I first heard about SR almost a year ago from a web article but was too sketched out to actually use it until September of 2012.

				Heard about it through a friend and never bothered with it until another friend tried to use it but couldn&#039;t which triggered me to get started about a year ago. First order was messy but ended up worked out, was scammed like a newbie easy prey too like yourself and was a bit disheartened by the whole thing until I got the real feel for it and since then it&#039;s been mostly all good!<br /><br />I find it quite addictive actually between ordering and the forum and have learned a lot since beginning just over a year ago!

In that time I have realised&nbsp; that MDMA, Amphetamine &amp; Cocaine are a fraction of the price in Europe than they are here in Australia.<br />I have spent over $8,000 on drugs which would have cost me $30,000+ if I bought it locally on the street.<br /><br />I have also been a weed &amp; hash vendor for 7 months.

				I learned to be more addicted to the forums and do a LOT of research on the vendor your going to use and make an educated buy . I would rather pay more for a reliable vendor its worth it compared to paying less and getting shit, or nothing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have not been scammed once (knock on wood) since Ive been here and it is just a great feeling.&nbsp; I spend a little bit of time on the forums every day trying to find new cola dealers that are making a name for themselves.&nbsp; Its only when the heavy hitters dont have any listings when I go on to see new vendors with low prices.&nbsp; I am so thankful for these forums and the members that share their experience so that the rest of us dont get scammed or end up getting bunk products.&nbsp;

				Been here for a couple months now, and apart from being scammed on 2 of my first buys ( 1 by a predatory 100%er, would you believe!), where I failed to follow some golden rules, it has been an amazing experience. Used to buy weed on the clearnet many years ago, but that was rarely worth the effort, once the authorities shut down the biggest sites, and have bought pharms too, but everything on SR is so well designed and genuine in its attempt to act as a trustworthy middleman (for a small fee of course&nbsp; ;)), and protect the anonymity of buyer and vendor, that I can&#039;t help having fallen in love ( :-[) with the whole idea of it all. It&#039;s also a very important 2 fingers toward the prohibitionists, and a real blow against the waning &quot;War on Drugs&quot;. Plus I love the emphasis on real quality, high-grade products, at the same time offering budget items for those of us who can&#039;t afford the very best all the time.&nbsp; ;D<br />&nbsp;

				I found this place 7-8 months ago, have had 53 transactions, spent 5800 dollars or so and haven&#039;t been scammed once yet (knock on wood). There was one package that never arrived and the vendor reshipped quickly and arrived no problem.<br /><br />If it weren&#039;t for the information available on this forum for research, SR itself would be much more of a crap shoot.

				I&#039;ve been here about 2 months, and I happened across SR completely by accident. I had started using DuckDuckGo and I was trying to find a mail-order vendor for 2C-B. Guess what... I found one!<br />I spent my first two hours surfing these very forums from my cellphone, just long enough for me to discover how foolish that is. I then spent the next two weeks researching the forums, figuring out BitCoin, setting up PGP, becoming accustomed to Tor\TAILS, and learning how to not get scammed on Silk Road.<br /><br />Speaking of, I&#039;ve never been scammed and I&#039;ve now had many successful mail-order transactions from a tiny handful of superb vendors. I REALLY like these vendors. They have excellent track records and forum credentials... &#039;cause they deserve it. Shout-out to:<br /><br />Aidoneus for MDMA<br />Righteous for 25i-NBOMe<br />ForeverJung for 2C-B<br /><br />Vendors like these are the backbone of Silk Road. They work their asses off to make sure you receive what you&#039;ve paid for. Don&#039;t be an idiot. Browse safe. Use Linux. Read the forums. Research your vendor. Know your drug BEFORE you take it. Never finalize early... and ALWAYS finalize the second you&#039;re able after receiving your product. After all... they&#039;ve done their part. Anything less is disrespectful.<br />[/rant]

				Stats? Well lets just say I thought mine were good on the buyer side(0% auto 0% refund, $enough to buy a car, but significantly less than 100k) That is until I became a vendor and could see some of your guys stats. Holy shit! <br /><br />Experiences wise, I have gotten scammed a few times. Sometimes by vendors so shitty, SR gave me full refund and didn&#039;t ding my stats, others because I stupidly FE. That being said, I am willing to FE for some vendors. <br /><br />Vendor side?- Well I am still at (100) even though once every blue moon somebody gives me less than 5/5. Some for stupid reasons, one person gave a 3/5 because my paper was too strong for them.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186042.msg1358141#msg1358141">Quote from: Garrincha on July 19, 2013, 09:49 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Vendors like these are the backbone of Silk Road.

On one hand, I have been sold product that is completely different than advertised and if I had not followed due diligence I would be have been screwed out of my money. On the other hand as vendor its extremely frustrating when you have stacks of orders that you know have probably received their items and are just waiting to try it, or worse it for it to auto finalize because they forgot. I would recommend you at least open the package before finalizing, and examine it closely (I could tell by the smell and texture of one now banned vendors product was Methylone or some crap instead of mdma.) With experience it becomes easier to pick up on subtle tells. That is frequently not enough, for example what I vend (LSD) any schmoe could shove some paper in an envelope. Granted not every schmoe could get (100) feedback with a large number of consistent transactions. The best solution I have is, reagent tests use on every order, or just when ever you have any doubt. <br /><br />I struggle to understand the motivation of vendors who are legit, but then decide to double cross their customers. Sure I could start sending blank paper to my customers today, but how many people would really finalize before my stats would be completely shot up? There&#039;s no way that would make more money then if I just stayed legit for one more week.<br /><br />Of course if you consider FE scams, then the hands change. Once you pull in all the FE money and disappear, you can always start a new account and work your way up again( easy enough to do if you have the resources and know-how) I discourage any buyers from FEing ever with any vendor, but if you are going to do FE, I suggest you do it on vendor a long established that does not do mostly FE orders, because then they do not have the massive incentive to scam and start over. NEVER FE on a new vendor, or an established one that suddenly requires FE on all orders (often with a price break)

Never again have i ordered from them and his unorganized company. Ordered ecstasy pills for ฿18 which is a fortune for them now.<br />They were terrible at replying, and constantly told me they &quot;we will forward this information-blah-blah.&quot; They never came back with information or gave me a tracking number which i requested.<br /><br />After that, i got some cocaine (67%) from FrankMathews, and requested i did NOT finalize early (FE) because i didn&#039;t want to go through that again. He allowed me; within 2-3 days i received the product. I released the coins immediately for good karma and both of us were happy. Good for him, i came back again with larger orders.<br />Since then, i have had 100% success rate (except from that noobish German vendor).<br /><br />Advice for newcomers: Always request escrow to prove their legitimacy. Both you and the vendor will be risk free - - - SilkRoad is NOT responsible if you FE - - -<br /><br />**Updated: - - Sukey - - is AWESOME: everyone order from him. He is legit and supplies excellent quality products and services**

				My biggest reservation about the many transactions i&#039;ve made, is not the danger of it not arriving (never happened yet), but rather the lack of quality of some of the stuff i&#039;ve ordered, which has borne very little resemblance to the product advertized by the vendor. I know that the feedback system is meant to counter this problem, but then I read advice saying you should always message a vendor before leaving less than a 5. Why should I message someone who I know has sent me low-quality goods? All they&#039;re gonna do is send you a reply saying there was nothing wrong with the product in question. There seems to be a bit too much pressure to always give 5/5.

				I been a customer for over 2 years and have made plenty of orders, so yes I got beat a few times, but i also got to realize that history/track record is everything.&nbsp; And not just a vendor with 100% and 40 sales, but a vendor with 95% with 300+ sales ill go with everytime.&nbsp; Because there are always customers that are going to complain if you have enough orders.&nbsp; If a vendor has 300+ sales,&nbsp; 99.999% if you just place your order, they WILL send it exactly how they say, they dont wanna &quot;chat&quot; or track it, or even be friends, lol&nbsp; its vendors with 20 sales, I dont care if everyone writes a book on how amazing they are,&nbsp; im nervous, only because the 2 or 3 times i got beat werent just $40.00 it was like $200 order which to me is not the end of the world but a problem I didn&#039;t need.&nbsp; So my suggestion to new vendors,&nbsp; in the beginning, dont write the &quot;rulebook&quot; on your profile, dont lie about when your shipping, or that its been shipped, when it hasnt,&nbsp; because then we are unsure whats going on.&nbsp; Also I noticed new vendors seem extremely paranoid.&nbsp; With no reason.&nbsp; I remember one order from Hammertime, it was a day late and he is like a living clock.&nbsp; So i messaged him asking if he would track it.&nbsp; He said it was delivered yet it wasnt, i wasnt nervous at all and either was he, (even though he was expecting me to panic)&nbsp; but he just said check at the post office, I went, told them there should be something for me, and they gave it to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;He made a statement which really was true, &quot;Dont panic, they are not in the business of busting criminals, they are in the business of delivering mail&quot;&nbsp; So I dont want to pretend like everyone is invinsible, but the talk that goes on especially on the forums is just unneccessary in my opinion.&nbsp; But I could be wrong

				I&#039;ve been a member for two years, 53 transactions and I took a 50% refund because a product didn&#039;t arrive I never blamed the vendor. As the mail service can be pretty crap. Lots of stuff has been delivered to my address that belongs whole streets away.<br /><br />Got here through the famous gawker article. Lurked on the forums for a bit, did a lot of research. Opened a Mount Gox account first and did bitcoin through there for a while. Ordered some DMT first and crapped myself, now I order without even considering the risk on the mail side. I have a company address for a drop site. So it all looks like business mail, the risk so small it isn&#039;t worth worrying about.<br /><br />If they pin ordering drugs on me, it will be through bitcoin and the transaction trail to prove that I bought it. Remember the wire and hand-to-hands? LE need to prove the financial transaction. I now use local bitcoin and never use exchanges anymore. I don&#039;t want any electronic trails for my bitcoins moving around.<br /><br />Never been scammed. I stick to the same vendors that I have always used from the start. If i want something new I research the vendor and buy small amounts to test them. <br /><br />Most people make mistakes or get scammed through lack of research. That&#039;s the biggest problem when we have a rush of new people turn up through media articles. They don&#039;t do their homework and end up paying for it.<br /><br />FH

				Like I said earlier, my main bugbear has been an (occasional) lack of quality for certain products/vendors. The point of a site with the principals of SR should be an emphasis on top-grade products which put street quality drugs to shame, certainly if prices are going to be higher than on the street. Not to say there shouldn&#039;t also be affordable budget products too, but these should always do what it says on the tin! For all that i&#039;d still rate my experience on SR 90% satisfactory. Long live the revolution!!!&nbsp; :D
