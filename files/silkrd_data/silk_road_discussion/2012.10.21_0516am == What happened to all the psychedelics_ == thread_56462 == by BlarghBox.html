				DMT isn&#039;t around like it used to be because moon unit and buddha aren&#039;t setting the price and quality standards as low and high (respectively) as they used to be.

				Patience is a virtue and something should come along.&nbsp; There are a lot of vendors providing all kinds of psychedelics right now although some I wouldn&#039;t really put into my body out of personal views.&nbsp; Every one gets a kick out of different things, just look a little harder and you&#039;ll find &#039;em.<br /><br />As for DMT, isn&#039;t there a vendor named DiMiTriSpice or something like that?&nbsp; I&#039;m not really familiar with that scene but I remember that name for some reason.

Sonoran Song was built on our love for Mimosa, and we rose rapidly from relative obscurity to being the top vendor in a matter of months. We had the cheapest domestic prices, the best packaging, and the highest quality MHRB that anyone had ever offered. You loved our customer service, delivery times, and the excessive amount of free mimosa that we gave away. And we loved (and still love) you all. Unfortunately, we found that the US government had been casting it&#039;s ogre-like shadow over MHRB (and related material) for quite some time. They informed us (to our complete surprise) that our wonderful clothing dye contained a controlled substance -- something they called &quot;DMT&quot;. Instead of informing us of their displeasure with our infraction in a civilized manner, they decided to gather an army of men to raid our premises. On September 10th, 2012, our home and offices were raided. They took all of our clothing dye, along with a great deal of unrelated plant material. We witnessed first hand the &quot;war on drugs&quot; taking another violently meaningless stab at our cognitive liberty.<br /><br />Fortunately, the staff here at Sonoran Song were not charged with any crimes. However, the effects of the raid have been fairly substantial. Fearing a similar invasion of their premises, all of the remaining large vendors of MHRB in the USA have ceased carrying it. Many have also discontinued a number of other related plant materials. And, at the time of writing (October 2012), there are no longer any commercial harvesters/suppliers of MHRB left. Before the raid, there were two: Don Jose aka The Galactic Toad (Mexico), and Adenium Mimosa (Brazil). Don Jose seems to be on vacation, having ran away with over $10,000 of our money. Adenium, always a fantastic and highly reliable supplier, recently announced that he is no longer able to take payments for or ship any MHRB to anywhere.<br /><br />Please do not email or call us with any requests for MHRB - we do not have any, and will not import any more. We will also not be carrying any of the related planted materials. If any of you still have any refunds that are due from early September 2012 - please do contact us by replying to your original order email. We are incredibly grateful for all of the relationships that we have made over the past year, and hope to continue building them for many years to come. Thank you all!<br /><br />blessings<br />Robert &amp; the team @ Sonoran Song<br /><br /><br />OH YEA, DID I forget to say that I vend domestic DMT!?&nbsp; &nbsp;I have pics, feedback, forum review,&nbsp; 100% delivery rate on 80 orders , and been here for a year+&nbsp; &nbsp; We have plenty of bark ( NOT FOR SALE) it just needs to be processed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have recently updated my profile due to the influx of high demand which also makes me suspicious on the new cheap DMT listings from people with no feed back and no pictures. Ive already made another thread in the Rumor Mill warning people to beware of fake DMT scamm listings from shady people . I also posted in the roundtable Vendor section of the forum. Please people do not fall victim to these to good to be true prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;PM me if anybody has any questions :)<br />

				There has been a sudden influx of LSD recently, i heard somewhere in Europe has just come into a large batch and the crystals are coming over the the UK in plenty. Something similar in my opinion to LSD is 25i-nbome however be careful with this as i know a few people (me included) who have ended up having LONGGGG seizures (30mins - 1 hour long) so yeah be careful with the Nbome im staying off that shit now. <br /><br />I&#039;m no vendor but i do know people who live near me with good quality shrooms and have a few grams at the moment.

				I&#039;m a UK based vendor and we sell magic mushrooms. <br /><br />Just want to chime in on the high price thing - I totally get that buyers in the US and some other parts of the world do not want to pay $30+ dollars for a trip. If I were you, I wouldn&#039;t either, because that is not the price the market in my country supports.<br /><br />Fact is, compared to the US, we get half as much food for twice as much money. Our fuel costs due to taxation are fucking ridiculous. I&#039;m not whinging; these are statements of relative fact for anyone in &quot;Great&quot; Britain today.<br /><br />We know you only want to buy mushrooms or whatever, but when you buy from a vendor, you automatically buy into all the other stuff the vendor does too, whether you like it or not. You&#039;re are not just buying your DOC. You are buying how invested that person is in what they do, how they package, what materials they use, how much they spent on it, whether they actually bothered to read all the postal profiling notes, blah blah blah.<br /><br />Of course, none of that really concerns the buyer. They just want a decent psychedelic experience for a reasonable price.<br /><br />What is reasonable depends on your market. Therefore, buy within your market and not from me. Really. :-)<br /><br />If we are too expensive for you, do not buy from us.<br /><br />Fact is, this is our 3rd or 4th mushroom listing. We sell out within a a day or two each time. The current stock has been the smallest batch and 50% of it went within an hour of the Vacation bug being fixed. Our packages have gotten all over the world, even into places where I REALLY wished I could have requested FE because I felt uneasy. <br /><br />Here&#039;s another one - our packaging was so good, the Mrs was quite put out by the fact that other vendors copied it. Well, maybe a coincidence, but a funny ego trip for her none-the-less. :-)<br /><br />Anyway - the point is this:<br /><br />* Unless it was something I REALLY wanted, I wouldn&#039;t send 3000 miles across the ocean for it if it is available in my own country at a slightly higher price. It would have to be desirable. It would have to be a specialty item. It almost certainly would not be contraband. Otherwise, why not just pay the rate the regional market has set for the sake of a few units of currency? But they are MY values and what is important to me. I&#039;m trading off against convenience of course, which is indeed one of the choices.<br /><br />* This market is HUGE. I am not afraid of vendor competition in terms of pricing yet, and neither should anyone else be. Besides, if it all comes down, my backout plan is in preparing a exclusive type business model. Yes, we rely upon this, but do not keep all your eggs in one basket.<br /><br />/namasteandlove!

				Most likely cause the vendors have made their listings private. They are only open to their customers and are doing just fine really. My vendor only has a set number of people he sells to. that&#039;s it!

				This is a good topic question because just a couple months ago there were much more lsd, dmt, and mushroom vendors... the basics when it comes to psychedelics and imo the best... This is the first i heard about the crackdown on the materials to make dmt but it makes some sense as far as lsd there are still quite a few vendors but they lack the reputation of the vendors such as vitacat.&nbsp; I am confused to why there are not fair priced cubensis shrooms because those seem to be the easiest to get irl but then again that might be why people are not selling them on the road because they are so easy to get rid of IRL&nbsp;

Also, this has nothing to do with stealth mode (SOMETIMES).<br /><br />This happened to me when I switched my LOCATION from USA to RUSSIA or toUNDECLARED FOR INSTANCE.<br />I had no idea why there were limited number of items for sale.. <br /><br />The system must somehow try to organize w/ code where vendors choose to sell or not sell their product.&nbsp; &quot;Thusly, affecting the product selection you can see.......<br /><br />Try just using UNITED STATES versus any other location.&nbsp; &nbsp;I promise your selection will expand RIDICULOUSLY!&nbsp; <br />It;s just that UNDECLARED seems to fuck your selection.&nbsp; Universal mystery.<br /><br /><br />Peace brother,.
