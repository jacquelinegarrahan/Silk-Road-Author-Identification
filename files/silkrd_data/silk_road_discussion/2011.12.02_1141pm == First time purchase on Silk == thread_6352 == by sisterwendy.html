[needed to have thought about where you wanted goodies posted to....what name to use ..and exact address...}<br />6. review the buyers guide on the SR site...<br /><br />ok..<br /><br />

				Also, make sure you get PGP set up and confirm it&#039;s working.&nbsp; Go to the security sub-forum, read the stickied PGP thread.&nbsp; There&#039;s also a thread for posting and testing PGP.&nbsp; You can PM me to test it once you get it set up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t buy several oz&#039;s of anything for your first purchases. Vendors tend to be very cautious of first time buyers that want weight (with good reason.)&nbsp; You&#039;re probably going to have to finalize early for your first purchase, especially if it&#039;s international.&nbsp; Find a seller with good feedback and a thread on the forums, buy a small amount, and be patient. Get a couple of small successful transactions and move up from there.<br /><br />SR is the greatest site I&#039;ve found in all my years on the web, and it works well, but nobody dives right in their first couple of days.&nbsp; Patience is key.<br /><br />Welcome to the Road!&nbsp;

				Thanks guys. I have downloaded the GNU software. Could I test out an encrpyted email with anyone?<br /><br />Also, how can I buy some bitcoins annoymously?<br /><br />Also, should I be using a VPN/proxy on top of Tor?

				Here&#039;s a thread for you&#039;re bit-coin question: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6079.0<br /><br />However, it kind of depends on your location.&nbsp; US can use moneypak to buy directly on the road.&nbsp; That&#039;s how I do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s more expensive than off-site, but it&#039;s quick and convenient. There are vendors who take Pay-safe and even paypal, I think, but I have no experience there.&nbsp; Like I said, look through the security sub-forum (not just the first page, older threads are useful to.) Make sure you read up on tumbling coins if you purchase them thru paypal or your bank account.&nbsp; You&#039;ll want to tumble them no matter what if you buy them from a source linked to any identifying info.<br /><br />As for PGP.&nbsp; Here is my public key:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBE6ve4EBCAC1HJ3mpngarB9HiD6zXCylL+VnuMEm9Z4GknNEugIbJI761mwa<br />HnP0MvpipDGH/PfPHBeDaRnolvEcJt8wZllLiGTyiVvVfcAf+rNe7bap3rJ5QYYN<br />DR2KSlgKj1vuxuoAAGqeZftOeHrkWc3YBui9ULerjY/RNPFQG2ZrDjVB1MSKZdf1<br />NutXCeVYBfEwIsY2nn30bGfQ69g7kzioPoKt0mDt5UoSa2JQSzeyWvW17yLXwFJR<br />oREs/kLlO4LHZPxClMzOk6vsyU7JvsYUYlfT3vnBqSB/8uOiihJKJ00scHWQc8z5<br />/XXwW8geICOhLJYncXnTCyigbh1h6TSfEeC/ABEBAAG0M2lsbHVzaW9ub2Zwcm9n<br />cmVzcyA8aWxsdXNpb25vZnByb2dyZXNzQHRvcm1haWwubmV0PokBOAQTAQIAIgUC<br />Tq97gQIbDwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQ942u/6qJoUu+agf9<br />GFI+t08sSwYozBHbitHq5ZfaZHH/X5WI73augfCJyZOWbLiWGu3bLcBfGMsizo9A<br />jWjzH6aV2dhfyhKZWVW7Vccam7nEDiS+/X98lJcFAf85+2ePtg0Wkw/Rgww86wkd<br />XGyeHr54XNlW2daF/56/SOK808KQeIdhktGnNG1yy6y4iChH4nBpfgYYfoHh27yl<br />GX4MgdushGKamaLLjcvHDlWiTSIAyLTsq8B/FnoDzDUC3J9EkvKkNCkaYOER7u/+<br />MZBKNOdvlbxPFieZUPgNwBnFjtXzav3ODH+ma4rOhWEaV7pFSUsxg9eY83VnelsV<br />292Q0Zdq5urSyCOrlr1NSw==<br />=HU/O<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />Copy this, and import it to you pgp software.&nbsp; Next, open notepad and type any message (you can just write &quot;pgp test&quot; if you want.)<br />Copy the text from notepad, no need to save the doc, just right-click and copy. In your pgp software, select clipboard, then encrypt.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be prompted to select a recipient.&nbsp; Choose my certificate that you just imported and click ok/next.<br /><br />It will then post the encrypted message to your clipboard, open a reply in this thread and right-click and paste.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see the encrypted message.&nbsp; Post it, with your public key if you want me to send one back.&nbsp; I&#039;&#039;l decrypt it and send you an encrypted message confirming that I was able to read yours.&nbsp; You can then select and copy my encrypted message and decrypt in pgp.&nbsp; It goes directly to you clipboard, so open a new notepad doc and paste it.<br /><br />That should be it.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be on for a while if you want to try it out.<br /><br />Remember: ONLY post your public key!&nbsp; Never post your private one, and be sure you&#039;ve written down your pass-phrase.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need to enter it to decrypt messages sent using your public key.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope that helps, I&#039;ve only just started doing this, so my explanation might not be the clearest.&nbsp; I&#039;ll help you out the best I can if you need it.<br /><br />EDIT: not sure about the VPN/proxy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t use them, and from what I&#039;ve read TOR is secure enough on it&#039;s own.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor or anything, so my exposure is limited compared to some on here.&nbsp; Some people use an entire encrypted USB boot drive before using the road, but that&#039;s definitely above my level. <br /><br /><br />

				&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; Some people use an entire encrypted USB boot drive before using the road, but that&#039;s definitely above my level. <br /><br />This.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done this and feel a bit better about it.&nbsp; I have an encrypted USB key with tor bundle and my keepass.&nbsp; Just download TrueCrypt and it is pretty easy to create an encrypted drive.<br /><br />I just placed my first order Wednesday and I&#039;m anxiously awaiting my product :)&nbsp; Good luck!&nbsp; Once you get pass the learning curve it is very fun to window shop/purchase.&nbsp; Also I love communicating via PGP, makes me feel kind of hacker-ish. :D<br /><br />

				First: As we tell everybody, you have to study up a lot more, on your own.&nbsp; We can&#039;t take the time, and pages to pass on the knowledge, but your concerns are understandable, it&#039;s just the nature of SR, that we expect newbies to do exactly what we had to do, which is study study study.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d start with the &#039;Security&#039; forum.&nbsp; Take a couple hours and go through that forum backwords, starting from the first posts in this forum.&nbsp; It take s a couple hours, and you can breeze thru a lot of it, but it will really help you.<br /><br />You wouldn&#039;t be here if you didn&#039;t understand TOR.&nbsp; Many of us also use a live linux distro, for purchases, which, if you are interested, means reading up on TAILS or Liberte Linux, and see what we&#039;ve had to say on that...<br /><br />PGP, the cursed thing, takes study on your own.&nbsp; You seem to have gotten where we all got to, which is to ask for a partner to send encrypted msgs to, and that is sort of a constant learning process, it took me a couple days of messing round with it to get comfortable.<br /><br />I use pgp when it is provided by the vendor, don&#039;t worry about it when it isn&#039;t.&nbsp; I use Tails or Liberte for purchases, plain old TOR on the forums.<br /><br />BTC, read up, and you&#039;ll see that it is an ongoing dialog, that we don&#039;t all agree on.&nbsp; There are some honest vendors on here, like SugarMama, but you don&#039;t have any protection if you buy from SilkRoaders.&nbsp; But this is just a new, volatile currency, and you don&#039;t really have any protection no matter *where* you buy them, as mtgox itself has gone under temporarily.&nbsp; I use get-gitcoin.com, and we&#039;ve posted plenty on how to use them, and the website itself is explanatory.<br /><br />On escrow: this is a huge and well fought area here.&nbsp; YOu really are going to have to make your own decisions.&nbsp; The site is based on escrow, but some vendors insist that you go outside of escrow, or &#039;finalize early&#039; so they are protected, but then you have no protection at all.&nbsp; I deal with vendors I trust, *or* make only small purchases from unkown vendors, if they have posted on here, and are just getting started.&nbsp; But I&quot;ve been ripped off--IP-- and I thought I knew better, so it can happen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Shit, I wrote a whole page, and didn&#039;t say much at all...yep, got to do what we all did: get some bitcoins, keep it small, pm your vendor, and don&#039;t trust *anyone* until your&#039;ve read up on this forum...which is to your credit that you came here first!<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />
