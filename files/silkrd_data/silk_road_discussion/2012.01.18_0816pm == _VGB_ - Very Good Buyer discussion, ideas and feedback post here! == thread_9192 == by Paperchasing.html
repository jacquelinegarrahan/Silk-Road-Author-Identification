				Dear Ones,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*VGB* denotation on my listings = Very Good Buyer listing with a discounted price.&nbsp; If you are a previous client of mine *in good standing* or referred to me by another VGB then your in.. once your in you can refer others *however* understand that if you refer trolls to me you will be responsible for their actions as well.&nbsp; In other words you will loose your VGB status if you refer an ass nugger to me.&nbsp; You can loose your VGB status by flaming, trolling or by making false allegations and/or claims made publicly on the SR forums as well.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;VGB&#039;s are also selected by myself for outstanding contributions to the SR community or SR forums as well.&nbsp; I have received a flood of PM&#039;s requesting details about how to become a VGB.&nbsp; You cannot make just one purchase with me now to become one at this point.&nbsp; Otherwise, anyone could by a $15 LSD hit and be one.&nbsp; If you make several purchases with me that go well I may choose to grant you VGB status at that time.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is my solution to the trolls, scammers, bickering and flaming.&nbsp; Instead of a price increase I believe a positive reinforcement financial reward will work much better instead.&nbsp; If your a good member of our unique online society, you will be rewarded.&nbsp; If your not, then you have every reason to become one and in fact can be one by being a contributing member of our experimental society here.&nbsp; I hope other vendors will join me in this quest to improve our community!<br /><br />Paperchasing<br /><br />Request for feedback on this ISSUE:&nbsp; Should VGB&#039;s names be listed publicly in the forums on a &quot;VGB APPROVED BUYERS LIST&quot; or kept private between myself and the vendors that choose to participate?

				Great idea, but I&#039;m not sure how it could be managed or whether you all could agree on what the criteria should be.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s as simple as $X worth of purchases without a lost package + not being an unreasonable asshat.&nbsp; This may be a good argument for having a private forum for those with a seller&#039;s account.<br /><br />I&#039;m all for some way of rating us buyers.&nbsp; I doubt I would qualify with anyone yet, but I have to be getting pretty close with Ivory by now.&nbsp; :D

				Paper, I truly admire what you are doing for the community.&nbsp; I especially liked how you stood up in the &quot;State of the Road&quot; thread.&nbsp; You make some very valid points and addressed some serious issues such as finalizing early is the real problem and not the OOE, even though I understand SR wants his cut.&nbsp; I support that 100%, he deserves his cut, but just say it, kinda like you said.<br /><br />I really like your VGB idea.&nbsp; The positive reinforcement is a great thing, rather than punishing us buyers.&nbsp; Not that I feel punished or anything.&nbsp; I honestly do not make many purchases here on SR as I&#039;m broke as a joke about to lose everything as it is.&nbsp; I have 3 purchases thus far all through nucleo since I&#039;m a doper, but everything went well with him and I feel him and I are somewhat friends as we just bs with eachother sometimes.<br /><br />About posting buyers publicly for the VGB, I think that is a bad idea.&nbsp; Personally I wouldn&#039;t mind being on the list publicly (I know I probably wouldn&#039;t qualify with my low stats) but there are many others here who really want to remain as anonymous as possible.&nbsp; Some people might be afraid to be on a list as VGB&#039;s since that kind of shows that they are very active buyers here and that might attract LE attention to them.&nbsp; Think if there was a vendor here that is actually LE and they know the person is a VGB, then they have more incentive to take that person down because who knows that VGB may have larger varieties or quantities of substances or both.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t know how to set up a mutual vendor VGB list but I hope it takes off in some way.&nbsp; Hopefully someone else here will chime in with some more ideas to help.<br /><br />Peace<br />bupebuddy

				Wow!<br /><br />What a great idea if you can pull it off.<br />How would you cross reference the recommendations?<br />I&#039;m sure you thought of that.<br />I don&#039;t think good buyers should be publicly named by that&#039;s my paranoia setting in?<br />You may create a market in selling good buyer accounts?<br /><br />No doubt vendors are getting pissed cause they rightfully suspect it&#039;s a small few who are repeatably ripping them off.<br />The sample scam sounds like the best one to me, lol.<br />So there should be buyer rep points like vendors have.<br />How can you do that without the blackmail?<br />Personally I think buyers should pay a fee to get the right to purchase anything, but this will do, if it makes the vendors happy.<br /><br /><br />Oh yea, I don&#039;t need to check I&#039;m VGB, and a 100%<br />I wouldn&#039;t risk it to recommend anyone&nbsp; :P<br /><br />As I read the new posts coming in, we all agree changes need to be made, for the better.

				I hadn&#039;t really considered the bit about drawing attention to specific buyers....Nevermind what I said.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never made a purchase here.<br /><br />Maybe the best way is just to give buyers the option to buy their way in.&nbsp; I know I would.<br /><br />I would think that, as a seller, you wouldn&#039;t want to recommend your best buyers to your competition anyway.&nbsp; Some of you have to keep a mental note of who the quality buyers are too.&nbsp; I know that personally as a newer member who is only searching out one type of product, I have sampled a handful of the top sellers and will likely settle on one or two to make my regular purchases.&nbsp; Then again, maybe I&#039;m not the typical buyer here.<br /><br />As an aside, I&#039;d love to see *something* implemented to put buyers into a &quot;trusted&quot; or &quot;elite&quot; status.&nbsp; As it is now, 100% of the sellers I&#039;ve seen for MDMA require FE (even the new sellers).

				Im thinking it might be tough unless you could log IP addresses, which I dont think is possible here. Couldnt people just reregister with new names after acting like an ass? I suppose it would reward those who are consistent, and cool to work with, but Im not sure it would quite weed out the bad apples. Its a start though....

				I don&#039;t think any buyer belongs to me, so I&#039;m not a bit worried about giving away my best buyers to my competition at all.&nbsp; LE cant target buyers, hell you cant even find their email if you don&#039;t know their user number now that SR has disabled search from returning usernames homepages.&nbsp; Buyers HAVE to come to the vendors for the vendors to even be able to PM them.&nbsp; So what if &quot;MrSnuffalufagus&quot; is my #1 coke buyer, that don&#039;t help LE or the other vendors other than knowing that *if* MrSnuffalufagus orders from them they may want to take care of him very well cause he buys a lot thus benefiting MrSnufalufagus MAJORLY and the other vendor too because now they have a chance to gain a new reliable client.&nbsp; Knowing a username means nothing really.<br /><br />As far as people re-registering, well they can reregister 10,000 usernames and they still do not get the benefit of being able to order products from me at a discount because if they are not a VGB they do not get an order thru.&nbsp; If someone takes the time to build a reputation here on the forums and gets named VGB then their going to want to preserve that privilege which means that they will be careful not to troll, flame or unnecessarily stir up trouble within our community.<br /><br />@uniwiz, actually Im not pissed off at all, I really just see this as being the way of things to come and I want to improve it as fast as possible.&nbsp; Never have we been so connected and so free to discuss and plan the future of how we as individuals obtain the medicines that we choose to self-medicate with.&nbsp; I have a dream of a day when there&#039;s so many vendors that everything is always available, always high quality and the prices are so good that even the least financially capable of my brothers and sisters can afford to treat themselves without talking food out of their families mouth.<br /><br />Join me in this dream, we can do it.. all we have to do it stick together and make it happen.&nbsp; If enough of us believe in it then it will become our reality!<br /><br />AND a BIG THANKS to Mr. SR for having the vision, balls and downright in their face attitude to give us the OPPORTUNITY for this to even happen!!<br /><br />Paperchasing

				i like the idea of the VGB list although i&#039;m not on it.&nbsp; I agree with uniwiz that there should be a buyer rep point system such that when a transaction is completed the seller can give a 1-5 rating the same that buyers do.&nbsp; that being said, not all transactions carry equal weight. so there&#039;s another wrinkle.&nbsp; but over the long haul, it&#039;s probably as efficient a method due to the resulting mix of discerning vs non-discerning sellers/buyers.&nbsp; perhaps there can be a pro-rata system by which opinion is fractionated by the resulting rating of the giver.&nbsp; i.e. seller rating x given rating / all ratings.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks and blessings, g

				I like the idea as well, it seems it would benefit both sides of a transaction and hopefully encourage people to be on the level. We already have a suspicious buyers thread, but as has been noted those people can just sign up with a new name. Working up to getting a good reputation and keeping it is another matter entirely and should encourage the traits we desire in this community.<br />I am not sure if this is currently the case as I am only a buyer, but if there&#039;s a seller-only forum then a resource like this list should be kept in there. If there isn&#039;t then admin should consider that. It will keep the information with the people that can actually use it, and the general public at bay. Also you should contact the buyers and ask them if they&#039;d like to opt-in to the list, I&#039;d be a little disgruntled to find my SR account name posted on the forum without asking me. Lastly lots of people use different handles on SR and the forums, there would need to be some way of keeping track of who is who if you&#039;re going to use behavior on both as the basis for a place on the list. <br />Thanks for the idea Paperchasing hopefully it catches on.

				I support this 100%, I strive to be on it one day. Where I live it&#039;s impossible to get H so, a reliable honest seller, better prices, super fast/CARE-full shipping. I&#039;d prefer to steady buy weekly from someone I trust and don&#039;t have to question anything. Very good idea. I do however think most sellers remember who always comes back, never whines, never 2nd guesses the seller, and keeps BTC in their accounts. I&#039;d be in w/d and in pain 80% of the week if it wasn&#039;t for the awesome SR H merchants. Just my 2 cents, keep rockin. :D

				&nbsp;Sounds like a good idea to me. I&#039;ve been clearing escrow early for initial purchases from top vendors whom I plan on repeating business with. Most good vendors don&#039;t ask for it,but being a newish members, its something I personally want to do to ease the minds of vendors who deserve nothing less,and hopefully help me EARN a spot on the good list.&nbsp; If any of my vendors have &#039;VGB&#039; lists, I definitely want to be a member ;)

				Personally, I think holding people responsible and financial incentives can be a good thing, especially in an anonymous market. However it&#039;s done, I don&#039;t think giving buyers the chance to buy into VGB status is a good idea because that doesn&#039;t really prove anything really. Also, while the idea of recognizing people&#039;s contribution to the SR community is a good one I think there may be more than a few people here (myself included), for increased anonymity, that use different names when buying vs. when posting in the forums, so how would that work?

I understand that you&#039;re overwhelmed in the SR app and that their mail is slow and hard to use. But I sent a PM to you there, and encrypted it, and gave you my key. You sent back plaintext and asked me to participate here. I do see buyer vulnerability (I am a buyer) . I don&#039;t understand you being dismissive of buyers&#039; concerns for security. This is a public forum. No one should be giving references to other vendors here.<br /><br />It&#039;s not classic vulnerability - buyer gets busted, cops sit on him for connection, repeat until promotion. But LE is about collecting bits of information and using them to put together bigger bits of information. So, yes, they have sold drugs. And if that&#039;s what it takes to collect user names they&#039;ll do it. Who would know? So they collect names and find someone that pushes the limits on size. Pop goes the weasel. Now this reputable buyer is working for the man. And he&#039;s collecting bits here and there - postmarks, shipping formats, etc.<br /><br />So I ask that you respect encryption. I ask that you don&#039;t expect people to communicate over the public forums. And I ask that you not tell buyers they have nothing to worry about.<br /><br />I&#039;d say things about your shipping options too, but I am loathe to say things publicly. But if someone is a VGB they should be entitled to the same deliveries as many of the long-term vendors offer.<br /><br />So color me black or just jaded. Buyers need their privacy respected too.

				So you decide who is a VGB? I think it would be a great feature to be added. After a certain amount of transactions the sellers who the buyer purchased from could be asked if the buyer was good, and then he&#039;d be granted VGB status.

Consider if LE sets up a vendor account and peddles some wares, along comes VGB #1, and voila, they have his or her address, or at least the beginning of a physical link to that person -- whom they know will probably be ripe for possession, or possibly even distribution or trafficking charges if the amount of drugs they bought to become VGB #1 is any indication. If anyone thinks there is any reason why LE wouldn&#039;t be able to set up an operation like this, I urge you to reconsider. I am personally aware of an instance where LE was selling hard drugs with impunity IRL to make busts. Think it couldn&#039;t happen here?<br /><br />Personally I would only use a VGB account with vendors I trusted as fully as this sort of context allows.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Paper, this is exactly what I was trying to say in my post.&nbsp; LE could very easily set up these VGB&#039;s by becoming vendors themselves selling wares and getting addy&#039;s of these people.<br /><br />JUST A THOUGHT THOUGH

				I think I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that the vendors themselves should PM the buyers on SR to notify them of their new VGB status, rather than posting a list anywhere. I realize it&#039;s probably more work on top of what you guys have to deal with but it seems a little better

				I think there should be a list of VGB that just circulates mainly through the top vendors on SR...and there needs to be some sense of security for the people that are put on that list. Work out all the kinks and try to fill any hole that could end up badly for those buyers if LE was to get involved. I think the chance of LE getting a hold of that list and doing anything about it with it being the top vendors hands is slim just for the fact the main vendors here have been here for a while and seen it all. Even though I don&#039;t have amazing buyer stats on SR, I have purchased countless times with a certain couple vendors and have built a strong sense of security in trusting them with my cash and information on hand. The idea of another vendor vouching for a certain VGB to another vendor is a very good idea as well as many vendors go hand in hand with product. All in all I think it&#039;s a good idea that needs to be perfected!&nbsp; 8)

				I like the basic idea.&nbsp; A relationship gets built up between two parties.&nbsp; Buyers that aren&#039;t asshats can get rewarded with better pricing.<br /><br />And I think that&#039;s where it should stop.&nbsp; No public list.&nbsp; No introductions - if you want VGB status with a particular vendor, you should have to earn it yourself, either via transactions with that vendor or via overall SR history, and each vendor would have to make his own determination as to what qualifies for VGB and what doesn&#039;t.

				Great idea PC. I think this could go a long way to helping vendors keep on the right side of escrow without losing out to the assholes.<br /><br />I&#039;d also rather the lists weren&#039;t public but there&#039;s plenty of ways to do that - each vendor can maintain their own list, or share among small groups of vendors who know and trust each other. If you wanted to do it in the site you could add a favourites/friends/vgbs list to the vendor account. That way new and untrusted vendors don&#039;t get access to any information until they&#039;ve built up some trust and reputation.

				I think I have the perfect idea for the VGB, but that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; There can be a PGP master key made for the VGB&#039;s that each VGB will get once they are established.&nbsp; They will have the password to this PGP key and have full access.&nbsp; Now the buy will still have their own PGP&#039;s but when they are placing an order through a vendor who accepts the VGB status they will encrypt the VGB PGP public key inside of their message to their vendor using their normal PGP key.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know it sounds good in my head, maybe there can be some critiquing.&nbsp; Maybe the vendor&#039;s can just sign our keys?&nbsp; I really don&#039;t know but I&#039;m trying to think of something besides a list.&nbsp; I just know some people won&#039;t want to be on a list of such so we need to think of other options.<br /><br />Peace<br />bupebuddy

				I think that SR should implement a private vendors forum on its server or whatever...that should be a perk of the increased cost of having a sellers account.&nbsp; Then, using encryption, the sellers can exchange ideas and stuff kind of like a Grange, even arrange to each have a sale at a different time or whatever, like the grocery stores...this could increase sales and profits for all of them if done correctly.<br /><br />This would be in the ideal world.&nbsp; I think its too easy for LE to break in this way.&nbsp; That&#039;s just the way I think, because not many on THIS site know who anyone else REALLY is.<br /><br />I personally would not want my account name posted in an open forum, the two user names are different on purpose.&nbsp; Now, certain vendors...if they had lots of time and really cared, could probably figure out how to connect the two names...but I don&#039;t think they care.&nbsp; All of my purchases have worked out perfectly.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why but it really bothers me that a trusted vendor would even think about doing that.

				Great Idea!&nbsp; That last post is a keeper, Paperchasing.&nbsp; Inspiring, and exactly the reason I am here.&nbsp; I support the VGB, though I am not sure about the best way to implement it.&nbsp; It seems like it may be something Security Solutions could incorporate into their Secure VM.&nbsp; Maybe as an upgrade.&nbsp; Also, the folks that view SR as a Community vs. say, just a drugstore, are IMO most likely to be happy to spend the time building personal rep...and giving back to the Community.

				Personally, I&#039;d like things on SR as open as possible between buyer and seller. As much as I LOVE the VGB dealio, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d want a forum that I couldn&#039;t see what sellers were saying about me behind my back. <br /><br />NOT TO SAY THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN, but in my time lurking I have seen a few slipups (perhaps purposeful?) where angry sellers or buyers have said the real names or locations of the people they deal with and I&#039;d be terrified if something like that happened where I couldn&#039;t see it and report it.<br /><br />Feel free to say I&#039;m completely wrong, but this is just my thinking on the private forum situation.

				I think that Paperchasing&#039;s is on the right track, however, even though I am an active poster om the forums, and I do disclose some of my vendor relationships, I am a little leery of having a label stuck on me that could in any way be used to my detriment. Of course, I am a very good buyer - 0 auto finalize rate, .0x refunds. <br /><br />I hope that if a buyer incentive system is devised, that Paperchasing, my favorite vendor, will consider all of the implications and potential remedies of buyer ratings - public ones, that is. Private ranking or a voucher system that is kept private - that I can get behind. <br /><br />All respect due to Paperchasing, who is one of a handful of professional vendors in for the long haul - my loyalty is promised.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Isn&#039;t this what the &quot;buyer stats&quot; are for? SR tells me my &#039;buyer stats&#039; are given to vendors to help them decide whether to do business with me, or not. And the vendor has feedback and a 100 point rating system for me to make my decision on. I also have the forums, where I can go and see if a vendor is worthy a btc trade. <br />If I have many purchases, 0 auto finalize, &amp; 0% refund rate, does this not already make me a VGB? <br />If you have 90+ score, lots of positive feedback, and good forum postings, aren&#039;t you already a VGV?<br />Because I thought I was already becoming a VGB, according to my buyer stats. <br />And you&#039;re already a VGV, according to your vending stats. <br />And although vendors are supposed to not memorize addresses or names, I am sure that if you have repeat customers, you will eventually get to know that name and address. And at that point you could decide on giving deals, or not. <br />And the referral program is odd, too. I see post after post telling me to keep my SR visitation secret, but then I&#039;ve seen some posts from vendors offering discounts for referring my friends. <br />So, I don&#039;t know how I feel about this at the moment. <br />But I do know if there were a quality m vendor in the states, I would be a VGB. :) <br />

				Well SuperDimitri, ideally thats what the buyer stats was SUPPOSED to function like, but in reality they really are meaningless for the most part unless you know the buyer.&nbsp; See, there&#039;s no difference in me opening a free account, buying 90 E-books for $1.00 each and having a super awesome looking &quot;Buyer Stats&quot;&nbsp; (90 buys/0% refunds) all in about 30 minutes from start to fully rated and someone such as yourself.&nbsp; See you have ordered real drugs, and the example has not *HOWEVER* you both LOOK the SAME TO ME.&nbsp; This is because the buyer stats do not include any information such as average purchase price, duration of time in between the act of purchasing the item and the finalization and perhaps most importantly, written feedback from the vendors you have done business with.&nbsp; See, written feedback from Pharmville and Tetravort would mean something different to me than automated feedback from a digital goods provider in terms of &quot;type&quot; of customer you are and what not.<br /><br />On the other hand, the vendors are more closely monitored an publicly viewable in terms of feedback and such, there is provisions for buyers to write feedback about vendors so that the other buyers know a little bit about what their getting into with a vendor if they do so choose to do business with them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, buyers know what a vendor sells.. so there is no secret about how they eared their reputation... its all right there for anyone to read.<br /><br />Paperchasing<br /><br />ps - and yes, vendors do get to know who frequents their shops... just like you know exactly who you receive money from often.

				You have a good point, then. My attention was brought to digital goods to increase my stats when I joined, but I opted to not go that route. And I won&#039;t lie, it did cross my mind to &quot;pad&quot; my stats so I could order with certain vendors, but instead searched for decent ones that would deal with a newb w/o early finalizing. And found some good vendors! <br />So, this could be a great idea, then, but I would prefer it privately between vendors. I don&#039;t want my buyer stats available to everyone. But it would be nice if I could grab a deal from one vendor based on the word of another. An example would be a vendor who requires 1st time customers to finalize early, but another vendor whom I frequent gives me a good reference, and I can bypass EF. If it worked well, it could eliminate a lot of problems in the long run.

				Paperchasing, you have a great point here.&nbsp; Maybe vendors who have x amount of sales and have been vendors for x amount of time could see WHAT was purchased and the feedback given.<br /><br />How would you recommend keeping LE out of that?&nbsp; I have no issues with vendors knowing my purchasing history, except for the LE side of things.&nbsp; If I were LE I could become a &quot;trusted vendor&quot; and just focus on trying to get peeps who bought large amounts or who have a lot of orders.<br /><br />Anyway, This is my last day here on the forums and I wont buy from SR again (unless something catastrophic happens to my stash).&nbsp; I&#039;m doing a hit and run on this site and its time to run.<br /><br />You guys rock!&nbsp; Wish it was legal to buy weed.

				I think I like a VGB. It could be quite good for both sides. Also....I kinda see it as a possible buyer maybe user union against scamming. If youre a VGB and you put the word out of being scammed....SR could get innundated by quality sellers and buyers with valuable opinions. High reputation SR users being banded together with VGB band could prove quite powerful. Just imagine.....YOU ARE NOW VISITING A VGB PROTECTING VENDOR.
