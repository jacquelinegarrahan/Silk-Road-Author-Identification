				So I bought a gram of GodOfAll&#039;s coke because of the (mostly) rave reviews that I&#039;ve been reading about him. It looks, and most of all tastes and smells like GOOD shit, but on all three occasions that I have done multiple fat ass rails since last Friday I haven&#039;t felt a thing. Seriously. Nothing. As a disclaimer this is not me bashing him. I&#039;m starting to think there&#039;s something wrong with ME. In the past month I&#039;ve also order from BCPLTD and SugarKane and gotten real high off their stuff. <br /><br />So either GodOfAll sent me something that tastes, looks and smells like bomb snow and is really 100% fake, which I am highly doubtful of, or something in my brain is broked as hell. I have 2 g&#039;s coming in from LloydsBrothers hopefully tomorrow or Saturday so hopefully that will prove as a good test.<br /><br />Has anyone ever experience this? Or have any insights into his cocaine that might shed some light?<br /><br />Thanks community!<br /><br />A very not hight Danker

				I don&#039;t get the cocaine craze.&nbsp; People get what they say is high quality cocaine and say they went to bed two hours after using it.&nbsp; wtf.&nbsp; If I pay that much for something I want to be high all night.<br /><br />don&#039;t get me wrong.&nbsp; Cocaine is fun in a way, and if this Columbian we&#039;ve now got on SR really does start to deliver high grade cocaine for the prices he has listed then I&#039;ll have to buy.<br /><br />In the meantime I&#039;ve placed a big order for the mephedrone on sale from limetless.

				Big misconception with cocaine is that the high is supposed to be really speedy and jittery. The high from pure cocaine is actually quite relaxing, still very stimulating but not bouncing around the room type of high. I&#039;ve actually taken lines with people, then for about 15 minutes no one even says a word just stares at the tv haha. Not to say this is the issue, this sounds really weird..<br />Also you don&#039;t want to snort coke and be up all night, that means your not snorting coke&nbsp; :(

				Might have to try Meph in that case... Although I&#039;m definitely reluctant. No particular reason, just don&#039;t have much desire honestly.<br /><br />And TK... I&#039;ve done lots of coke, good and bad, and I can tell you that whatever is going on, I am DEFINITELY not getting high like I usually do. No euphoria at all. It&#039;s the weirdest thing. And I&#039;m not looking just for the speedy, jittery high either. Just the euphoric part which for some reason is not happening. I&#039;m interested to see what happens when I try Lloyds&#039;. Until then, that was a waste of money!

				No the problem is not you. I have also recently tried some of GOA&#039;s wares after reading good reviews only to get something that has absolutely zero effect. I know it&#039;s not me, because I have enjoyed charlie in all forms for many years and am well familiar with it&#039;s taste, feel, effects, etc. I have been messaging with GOA, wanting to give the benefit of the doubt due to his rep &amp; history to no avail. Either he has decided to get out of the quality market, or this ain&#039;t the real GOA anymore. I would strongly warn others considering an order....buyer beware.

				Well I&#039;m glad it&#039;s not just me DocOck, that makes me feel better for sure. In that case I&#039;m excited for my shipment from Lloyds. Seriously though, it sucks that he&#039;s gotten such good reviews, leading people to expect bomb snow only to get stuff that doesn&#039;t do anything.

				ok first thing first GOA is not the type of person that wou;d sell fake cocaine maybe this batch was bad or didntpersonally test it but fake is a bit much for GOA, Ive known GOA for about10months last year he had some of the top 3 cocine on silk road and if you were here last year you know that means alot.<br />OK so i know his connection dried up and he stopped vending for around 4 months upon his arrivial he was selling meth because he still was dry on coke but by chance be ran into an old friend or someone that hooked him back up with a connection. So i known the first few batchs were great but afromwhat appears to me several complain my opinion is it was a bad batch. O advise you to contact GOA and see if he can provide an additional information because GOA is the onky US coke dealer i&#039;d bother with trying to procure cocaine of a high quality.<br />I assure you there is an explaination that GOA might have an insight to he&#039;s not the type to rip pl off and prides himself on top quality and as we all know buying cocaine on th street is gonna be cut to fuck and all drugs sold have bad batches period.<br /><br />So contact GOA and I&#039;kk do the same and we can compare notes on Monday ok?<br /><br />X(<br />nomad

I&#039;m prob just being a pushover but I didn&#039;t want to come off as accusatory if I messaged him, mostly because of his reputation. But I will message him now and let&#039;s def compare notes on Monday. Talk to ya then! And thanks for speaking uo man (or woman :) )
