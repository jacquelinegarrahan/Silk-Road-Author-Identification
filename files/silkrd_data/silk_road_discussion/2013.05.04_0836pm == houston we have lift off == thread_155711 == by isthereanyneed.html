				It&#039;s currently moving very, very slowly for me, but at least it is up. The speed it&#039;s at right now is barely functional for me, but I&#039;m sure DPR is working hard on bringing it back up to speed. Thank you admins!<br /><br />

				When SR came alive, about an hour ago for me, it was blazing fast- fastest I&#039;ve seen it in ages, but I couldn&#039;t place any orders because the BTC I deposited yesterday still haven&#039;t shown up after 20 hours.<br /><br />Now they&#039;ve just shown up but the site&#039;s gone super-slow again.<br /><br />Ah well, at least I&#039;m in at last..... and very grateful to at least be moving forward :)

				Yeah, ridiculously fast for me too. Faster than the forums by far. Weirdly fast - but i&#039;m not complaining. Maybe the DOSer doesn&#039;t work UK bank holiday weekends... I wouldn&#039;t either. <br /><br />Nice.
