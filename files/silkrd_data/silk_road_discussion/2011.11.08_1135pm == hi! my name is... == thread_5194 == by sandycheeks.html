				sandycheeks! ya know, from spongebob? well anyway...<br /><br />just wanted to introduce myself, and let everyone here know that i think this is all super duper. I&#039;ve spent the last week reading through the forums. I&#039;ve read most of the security section (including the links provided for tutorials and anonymous communication tools), all of the shipping section (which is fucking awesome all around) and a lot of the rumor mill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve grasped the understanding and use of PGP, bitcoin (including getting coin from cash and tumbling), and have learned about the mistakes made when getting things shipped (like using fake names, bad addresses, po boxes, never signing anything, and never talking to LE which is something everyone should learn by the age of 12).<br /><br />I&#039;ve compared vendors to the forum posts made about them and by them, seen examples of scams and just plain stupid vendors (bad packaging, sending sig required, bad communication), and I&#039;ve seen what it takes to become part of the community around here. <br /><br />and so starts my participation in the forums! I&#039;m hoping I can contribute and make a trustworthy name for myself, because it seems that if you got &#039;newbie&#039; next to your name, there is really no way you can be trusted. if there is a problem with a vendor, and a newbie says &quot;they&#039;ve always done good by me&quot; or &quot;shits great! highly recommended!&quot; you have no idea if that person is the vendor that has an account in the wings just to justify or combat negative feedback. Also, feedback for vendors can be really sketchy sometimes. all this awesome anonymity has it&#039;s drawbacks for sure.<br /><br />I want to send a big thank you to all the moderators, hero members and anyone else who has kept an account open for months and contributed so much to the forum with your experience and wisdom. without you guys, it would be impossible to trust anyone here. thank you! your input, advice and honesty has been enlightening.<br /><br /><br />I know it&#039;s going to be hard to build a good rep around here, and i&#039;m really not looking forward to dealing with people out of escrow because i dont have any history; also, I worry about getting ripped off by vendors simply because people would obviously take the word of a good vendor over someone with no history that could be a scammer. let&#039;s hope i can find some decent, trusting vendors. <br /><br />anyway I&#039;ll shut up now. I meant to just say hi and thanks, and holy fuck i type too much.<br />

				Welcome to the Road :)<br /><br />You&#039;ve clearly done your research and that&#039;s absolutely fantastic. There&#039;s always a place for vendors who conduct themselves in a professional fashion.&nbsp; 8)

				Out of Escrow is a fools dream.<br />Sorry for those that have taken it from behind because of it but if you dont follow the simply posted guidelines on SRM you are destined for disappointment, It might work a couple times but at some point you will go out of escrow and get burnt.<br />Out of Escrow allows no accountability for the vendor.<br /><br />While we are talking about this I&#039;d like to express my opinion on new members finalizing early for being first timer customers is bullshit. Also finalizing early for overseas is bullshit, many overseas vendors do not require early finalization. I know because I&#039;ve never released escrow early just because the vendor is overseas. I understand it&#039;s a 2 face wall between vendors and customers, but no walls is even better...like the guidelines suggest.<br /><br />Sorry sandycheeks for the rant.<br />[/rant]<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				Maybe a new regime. Do nnot participate in OOE transactions period, buyers, full stop. The vendors will get back in line. And no apologies. There are vendors like Paperchasing that fully support escrow because they are in this for the long haul. <br /><br />I vote with my (Bitcoin) wallet - no more OOE. that&#039;s it.

				im psyched to hear that the mods and long time members are all for the escrow system for buyer protection. half of the reason i&#039;ve yet to work with (any) vendors is because of the fear of being fucked. if they demand going out of escrow because i&#039;m a new buyer, it&#039;d be hard to appear like i&#039;m not a sucker looking to get screwed over... and when i do, who&#039;s word do people take? the new member without any history of successful transactions? or the vendor with a strong customer base and good feedback? I&#039;m sure new buyers are a bitch to take on, because you just don&#039;t know what you&#039;re getting into (anyone can be a scammer, le, whatever)... and when they do agree to go out of escrow in hopes of becoming a regular customer, obviously it can be a little appealing to just not send the package... one less risk to take, right? obviously I see the opposite side too, hopefully us newcomers can learn to rely on the feedback/forums to make good decisions and do business with legit and honest vendors. <br /><br />while the forums and the feedback/rating system are amazing tools, building trust in a market where it&#039;s hard to rationalize trusting anyone will be difficult to say the least. asking a new customer to forfeit the only protection they have is a little tough to swallow :) i guess i&#039;ll start small, lol<br /><br />thanks everyone! happy weekend!<br /><br />
