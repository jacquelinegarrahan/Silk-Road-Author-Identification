				I have a message to the DEA.&nbsp; Stop fucking over your own species.&nbsp; Stop fucking over your own race.&nbsp; Stop fucking over your own countrymen.&nbsp; You might think that drug users are a drain on our society but it is you.&nbsp; You sir, are a drain on society.&nbsp; Alcohol and tobacco&#039;s social costs dwarf those of illegal drugs yet you claim that these substances are the culprits.&nbsp; They are the instruments of moral decay within the utopian society that we can envision.&nbsp; I am having trouble recalling the name of the economist from the Austrian school who came up with the broken windows fallacy.&nbsp; Well, see the unseen, this is not a window you are breaking to stimulate the economy but a PERSON.&nbsp; A FAMILY.&nbsp; A SOCIETY.&nbsp; And you are doing it for the 80k you get a year.&nbsp; The health insurance and the car payment.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give me a song and dance about how drug dealers must be in prison or pay for what they have done.&nbsp; They may pay a little but other people pay multitudes more.<br /><br />You come into people&#039;s homes with your fucking machine guns.&nbsp; You take the parents away from a child.&nbsp; You rectify it by telling yourself they are better off with their parents doing 20 years for that third crack offense.&nbsp; But the child is then aimless.&nbsp; The child receives less attention than he would from parents that are sleeping.&nbsp; The child goes to a boys home where he MUST be TOUGH and becomes exactly what the DOJ is trying to expel from society, a &quot;criminal&quot;.&nbsp; The DEA is rigged to win.&nbsp; In some twisted positive feedback loop by arresting drug users and dealers they just create more.&nbsp; Fucking bureaucrats.
