				The only conspiracy they need is one lie and a messenger to spread it.&nbsp; Why would they bother selling guns, they just have to write a memo to the news broadcasters in the room next door, and whatever the massive amounts of idiots in the world want to believe becomes reality, American style.

				I can&#039;t imagine the Feds would set anyone up on SR for purchasing personal amounts of drugs... it would lead to nothing and is not worth their time. But gun sales are a different matter. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if most gun vendors were connected to the feds.

				All the anti-gun people on SR are truly fascinating. I say it&#039;s the Feds creating these anti gun threads. <br />But really, where do the anti gun SR members get their balls from to tell everyone else whether gun sales should be permitted or not.<br />Freedom of choice should apply not only to drugs but guns too, unless you are a hypocrite.<br />Remember guys, its the criminals who don&#039;t really have a hard time getting the weapons, even in relatively difficult places like certain cities.<br />Guns will inevitably be widespread amongst criminals, SR at least gives everyone the equal opportunity to arm themselves. <br />Keep in mind, there is obviously a demand for guns. We need fine businessman to supply the demand.<br />If the gun sales continue smoothly, this can give us even more confidence in the technology backing SR.

				If they were to create another site for gun sales, then they&#039;d obviously have to employ totally different and isolated servers to host it. Doubt it would be worth the effort. <br /><br />Community pressure may be just enough to forestall any gun sales. Of course, we don&#039;t want to go into the area of having them banned. There is a slipper slope issue with that. But with community pressure which makes clear that the majority of members are against their sales, the seller of those guns must think twice. He would face an exponential rise in the risk of being scammed. Any anti gun opponents could easily start thread(s) stating that they were scammed and to not trust the seller or claim he&#039;s LEO. All of which would serve the purpose of tarnishing his reputation which would in turn make a buyer think twice about doing business with.&nbsp; &nbsp;
