				First lowest to highest &amp; highest to lowest search options added, now this! <br /><br />ON A ROLL DPR GO GO GO!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />This is an automated message to all sellers at Silk Road :<br /><br />We&#039;ve added a new feature for vendors that I hope will be useful for some of you. You now have the opion to create sub-accounts under your main vendor account that have limited access to your account functions. For those of you that employ others to assist you, I hope that you can reduce your risk and have better control over your operation by limiting some people&#039;s access. If you want a sub-account with full access, just set all premissions to full. Keep in mind that your PIN will still be needed for some functions.<br /><br />In a few days, we will limit account logins to one at a time, so if there are multiple people working your vendor account at the same time, sub-accounts will be a requirement. A section has been added to the seller&#039;s guide on the wiki with all of the details.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller&#039;s_Guide#Sub-accounts<br /><br />We are also making an adjustment to the function that governs the price portion of the weight for reviews and sales when calculating vendor feedback and &quot;best selling&quot; items.<br /><br />old function:<br />0.5 * log(0.07p + 1) + 0.001<br /><br />new function<br />1 * log(0.01p + 1) + 0.001<br /><br />where p is the price of the item in USD. The effect will be to give more weight to higher priced items, hopefully making it harder to manipulate a vendor&#039;s feedback score.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road Vendor Support <br />

				Very good. I&#039;m not a vendor but I can understand how those things can be very useful (and the weight feedback is useful all around).<br /><br />Now SR really needs a buyer&#039;s feedback system and then I want to see how Atlantis can continue with the shit of &quot;we have the better system&quot;.

They are proving once again that they&#039;re the 800 lb gorilla in this market. Nice work DPR &amp; Co.
