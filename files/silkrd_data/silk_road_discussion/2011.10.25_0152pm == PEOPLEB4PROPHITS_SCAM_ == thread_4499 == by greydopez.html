				good feedback for bad vendors is fairly common: that&#039;s the reason why I generally only trust the forums, and even here, u kind of have to sift thru it all, see if you can see what regular posters have to say about somebody...the goods I like attract a lot of scammers, and I never trust the feedback: way too easy to fake...over here, I kind of know who is reliable after a while, and if nothing else, I&#039;ll start a thread, see what others say....
