				Firstly I am not paranoid about the outages I have been a member for over a year and this has happened before sporadically and it has never been permanent. With that said. I&nbsp; do feel there needs to be better and more strict standards&nbsp; for both buyers and sellers if SR is going to continue to be viable service going forward. Two things come to mind. <br /><br />1. Make the barriers of entry to become a seller more stringent.&nbsp; &nbsp;Namely, increase the fees to become a seller and also limit the number of additional sellers allowed per week.&nbsp; I think a one time fee of something around 125-150 is cheap.&nbsp; This allows any idiot with a small amount of money to become a seller.&nbsp; It also allows sellers that build up a good reputations to be able to take BC from a bunch of people through FE and then just dash and open up a new account.&nbsp; It seems like this happens all to often. Now even the most honest seller&nbsp; can do this practice. It&#039;s easy to split with thousands of&nbsp; dollars worth of bitcoins and then just open up a new account a few weeks later.&nbsp; I know the&nbsp; unlimited addition of new sellers keeps competition steady and in theory prices down but I think it also increases the idiot factor and that will lead to only bad things in the long run.<br /><br />2.LIMIT THE NUMBER OF&nbsp; NEW MEMBERS.&nbsp; As it stands now all members should be grandfathered in but there needs to be a cap. on new membership going forward.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see any reason to have an unlimited number of users.&nbsp; I think this can only lead to major problems.&nbsp; Some high school kids are going to either A. die or get&nbsp; B. get busted and some parents are going to make it a mission to get SR shut down.&nbsp; Don&#039;t underestimate the power of an enraged mother.&nbsp; We saw what MADD did in the 80s.&nbsp; IMO the last thing SR needs is going up against a mandate from the public.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have thought about these issues for a while and the downtime has just really crystallized these feelings.&nbsp; :)

				I think a deposit by the seller would be a good way to do this. Make them pay a fee, and then they slowly get their deposit paid back over a year or so as they make good transactions. Make it big, and in addition to the new seller fee.<br /><br />As for limiting membership, maybe to a number per day but there should NOT be any limits on WHO can use SR. <br /><br />That being said, the hand-holding, and people instructing teenagers how to have drugs sent to their door needs to stop on the clear web. I (sound like a grandpa here) remember having to figure out how to get BTCs w/o Mt. Gox, and just using traders on here. Rough times, but that barrier would have kept me from placing an order if I was an idiot. When you hear people saying &quot;Well how much cocaine is in that ecstasy&quot; you know the general population is just a little too stupid to be trusted with what you can find on here. Already there&#039;s some news about people taking 2c-I they ordered thinking it was MDMA (because they really are THAT stupid) and dying. Possibly make people take a quiz to gain access to different drug classes?

				Preety much what im saying, new members need a reference atleast an limit the number of new members. Way too many kids under 18 on silkroad, few overdosed and hired private detectives as said on topix/xanax.com. Customs is working with the government, they can spot the usual methods of delivery. Sorry but certain countries like australia shouldn&#039;t be sent anything, too many risky behavior happening. If it continues silkroad will end up just like every single online market shutdown in the last yr.
