				Hey fellow SilkRoadians, <br /><br />So I recently placed an order with Hydrofarm, first time ordering with him and it was a large volume order. The order was placed last Tuesday, and shipping was delayed a while (it says on his sellers page that as of Sept 1st he was a bit backlogged with orders). Totally fine, I understand, things happen. But it is now Sept 8th, and not only do I not have my order, but Hydrofarm has now stopped responding to my messages (the messaging system here on SR seems to show that he has read them). <br /><br />All I&#039;m trying to get is an update on timing, and he&#039;s gone dark instead. So I&#039;ve decided to take it public in the hopes that 1) it might embarrass him enough to fucking respond 2) see if anybody else is having a similar problem or knows more than I do<br /><br />Thanks for the help, guys. Off to go smoke a bowl of green that I had to purchase IRL&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />

				Yep, stuck in same exact situation.<br />My order&#039;s in transit for few days now but he&#039;s been reading all my msgs not responding.<br />I hope he comes through if not, hope SR will get my money back (still in escrow)
