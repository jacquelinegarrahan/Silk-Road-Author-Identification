				Just waiting for the bitcoins to arrive and will then be purchasing my sellers account so be prepared to get shitfaced! Best quality and best price for this product!<br /><br />I aim to provide top quality product for the safety of those who wish to experience such an amazing product. I will try my best to maintain a 100% rating and will always be prompt in replying to messages.<br /><br />In the meantime, I am looking for 5 suitable candidates to receive a tester. To qualify, you must have:<br />- been an active member of this forum for at least 6 months<br />- five or more transactions on the main website<br /><br />These testers will be setup for you on the main site so I can have some feedback on my profile.<br /><br />You will also need to write a trip report in the forum and comment on the quality of this fantastic drug.<br /><br />If you qualify for a tester, please either PM me on the forum (not on the main site yet) or reply to this topic. Please include your buyer statistics for review. I will then choose 5 people and will let you know via PM and will post in this topic.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s going to be a very exciting experience for all of us on The Road to do business with each other!

				is it actually methaqualone<br /><br />or is it a more available RC market chem, such as etaqualone?? this would be more likely given the rarity of methaqualone<br /><br />many people come and claim they will have quaaludes but never follow through<br /><br />can you please post a link to your SR vendor account since you are posting the offer on the forum?

				Mandrax is the brand name of methaqualone in South Africa. Only time I saw it in person there , they were actually smoking it as a powder with Daga (a type of herb). They ceased legit production of it a while back but there is still a lot of it made in underground labs there.

				It is genuine Mandrax (Methaqualone) sourced from South Africa. I will post link to vendor account as soon as it is up and ready to go :) I&#039;m sure many have claimed that they can deal with this but I really can. I have just been ironing out some details such as shipping techniques etc. I can guarantee that ALL my orders will make it through!
