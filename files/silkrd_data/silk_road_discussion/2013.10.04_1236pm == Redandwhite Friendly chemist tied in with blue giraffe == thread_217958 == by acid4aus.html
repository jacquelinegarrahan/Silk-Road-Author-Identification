				Hey everyone<br /><br />A weird correlation i drew with some other very weird connections.<br /><br />I wont link any of this but its all in this forum.<br /><br />Blue giraffe the biggest GHB vendor and only vendor of powdered GHB Was actually BANNED from vending because he had a list of clients which got let out because of one of his employes.&nbsp; Now doesnt this already sound like What happened?<br /><br />There is a post on the forums with blue giraffe admiting this and others linking around this incident.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe anyone who ordered from him should clean house and hide like a mofo.&nbsp; His packages always came through even 1kg ones.<br /><br />Now GHB is also not illegal everywhere in the world, so the FBI could plausibly have set up blue giraffe in another country and ship from there without ever breaking the laws in that country!<br /><br />Think about this guys.

				Yep, da blue giraffe&#039;s names and addresses leak was the largest on SR.<br /><br />seems like that not-so-friendly chemist hacked into da blue giraffe dude &amp; threatened DPR.<br />Still, it doesn&#039;t make sense that DPR asked the gang demanding their money from the friendly dude to assassin him for 150,000.. while the friendly guy owed the gang 500,000 or so!

				BG&#039;s crime was to have a poorly encrypted document with the names and addresses of his customers stored on tormail when it was taken down in august (?)&nbsp; the blackmail happened at the beginning of the year and could have absolutely nothing to do with BG<br /><br />a functioning brain and a brief search of the forums and a read of the warrant request document would have shown it wasn&#039;t feasible.<br /><br />I really wish you conspiracy theorists would at least do a bit of research before you post this shit..&nbsp; oh that&#039;s right, this stuff is just trolling and is designed to unnerve people rather than anything else.<br /><br />pfft
