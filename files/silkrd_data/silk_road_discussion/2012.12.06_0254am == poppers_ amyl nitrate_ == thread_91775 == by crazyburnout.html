				okay someone asked me to look into something called amyl nitrate aka poppers. i have no idea what this stuff is but i figure its gotta be on the road here somewhere but i dont know which category it would be under. i tried using the search function but it just gives me a bunch of random listings that have nothing to do with it. can anybody help me out here? maybe tell me where to look or possibly provide a link? much appreciated

				Poppers (amyl nitrite, butyl nitrite, etc) would probably be classed as an Inhalant. Which I don&#039;t believe is a category. Try Other.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Actually it is a category:<br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/67<br /><br />No poppers listed though.<br />Not even any whippets? Wow. I see a market opportunity...

				Amyl is available freely on the clearweb. It&#039;s not illegal at all and is used a lot in the gay scene..actually i love amyl and yes i am gay. Rushing on amyl and mdma is all levels of awesome.<br /><br />Just do a search on the clearweb for it and you will find a lot of sites that sell it.<br /><br />

				amyl isnt available on the clear web to anyone , there might be websites advertising it but its banned in most countries , i think canada is one of the countries that can sell it for export only. Isobutyl was outlawed in the uk in 2007 and replaced with isopropyl which is just not&nbsp; good . people in the uk cant buy amyl or isobutyl nitrites from anywhere , theres poppers forums online with people talking about this but they probably dont know about SR yet and if people started using poppers after 2007 in the uk then they will be none the wiser anyway. Im not sure on the laws for each country but there must be somewhere in the world where amyl and isobutyl poppers are legal and there definiately is a need for it on silk road
