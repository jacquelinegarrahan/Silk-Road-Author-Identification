				no, SR is not down. They are probably adding something to the site or adjusting it. 502 is the error you&#039;ll get when they do that<br /><br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1115.0<br /><br />~B

				Actually the 502 error is caused by the request for the page timing out. Change your identity in TOR and it may fix the problem. When a site is down it is usually a 504 error. Just my 2 cents

				I would have to bet that is already setting up a bulletproofed secondary server that will be working in sync with the live server so that if someone hacked in and took over then that 2nd machine would promptly kick in and start servicing all SR marketplace activity.<br /><br />We had a system like this at my office.&nbsp; But I am not a tech guy and I don&#039;t remember exactly what they called it, but it was mucho nifty keeno.<br /><br />If SR is *not* either doing this or working on getting it set up...umm...then he&#039;s either the world&#039;s biggest optimist (possible? :P&nbsp; ) or not as smart as I think (way less likely, at this point!).<br /><br />But I doubt we&#039;ll hear too much about it either way.&nbsp; The less he says about any doomsday type scenarios in public, the stronger they are for him IRL.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just my two cents plain.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				@Xmachina, love that fuckin Signature. lol<br /><br />If this persists for you guys, just start from the ground up with powercycling/rebooting network equipment. If you have a static IP this matters too...it resets any logging generated and refreshes your relay circuit connection to/from your ISP.<br /><br />Sometimes our Tor bundles crap the bed, and don&#039;t do the identity change fully. If you refresh the page that checks your Tor connection, it&#039;ll tell you if you&#039;ve changed IP&#039;s or not.<br /><br />Change Identity, Go To https://check.torproject.org/?lang=en-US&amp;small=1, Refresh page, IP should change.<br />Keep changing it till you get a different subnet or range that you think is different from the subsequent connections, and give that a try too.<br /><br />Don&#039;t fuck with your torrc file either. Also, if you&#039;re relaying Tor, try connecting to SRM as well. I have luck doing that sometimes, but that could be just my connection.<br /><br />~Bï£¿

				Sometimes refreshing you Network Settings can be helpful..<br />Go to CMD -&gt; ipconfig -release<br />When finished processing type:<br />ipconfig -renew<br /><br />Can be a pretty helpful tool. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
