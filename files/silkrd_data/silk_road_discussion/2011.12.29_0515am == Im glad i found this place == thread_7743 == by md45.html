				This website&#039;s a really fun and secure place if you know how to use it right. It can be very exciting. Let me first tell you how to get bitcoins the easy way. First, there&#039;s many exchangers on the site. They take payments in moneypak cards. These are like gift cards which can be purchased at your local wal-mart. Load these with money and then visit any of the exchangers on the site. These are located in the money section. I recommend either sugar mama, btc buddy, or btc pal. You give them the moneypak number and they send you bitcoins for a small % fee. Typically this can take up to an hour. Another option is using dwolla.com. It&#039;s like paypal. You first have to get your bank account verified which takes way too long. Then, you must transfer the money, which can take 3 to 4 days. Once you deposit funds, you can then transfer them to mtgox.com or tradehill.com and buy your bitcoins there. I prefer mtgox.com, but to each his own. Once bitcoins are bought, you can transfer them to silk road with the address provided on your account page. <br /><br />Escrow is a way to make sure your money is safe and secure until you get your order. Typically the safest way to go is to order from sellers that do not require you to finalize before they ship. Unfortunately, being a new buyer, almost all sellers require you to finalize early. Just do small orders until you build up your reputation. If you are unsure about a seller based on their feedback, don&#039;t be afraid to search for their name on these forums. There&#039;s a section just for that called &quot;The Rumor Mill&quot;. You will be able to quickly identify the scammers from the legit sellers.<br /><br />The way it works is when you place an order you will be able to view it. The money you paid with will go into your escrow and the seller&#039;s escrow. They will then mark the order as in-transit. Once they do that you will have the option to finalize. Once you click that button, there is no going back. When you click finalize, the money gets taken out of escrow and the seller receives it in their wallet. Wait until you get your order before you click it.<br /><br />You may have also read about PGP. It&#039;s a way to keep yourself safe and your anonymity secure. If you are serious about this, learn how to use it. I can make you a simple guide if you&#039;d like.<br /><br />This site is very safe and secure when used the right way. Come to the forums if you are unsure about anything. Chances are there will be people that are willing to help. I can recommend seller&#039;s to you based on what you want to purchase if you&#039;d like.<br /><br />That&#039;s about it. It may seem complicated, but it&#039;s not once you get the hang of it. Any questions, feel free to get a hold of me.<br /><br />-Jimbob-

				Paperchasing is a very good and well known vendor for mdma. I haven&#039;t personally ordered from him so I can&#039;t tell you the quality. SDsticky is also a highly reputable seller. Again though, I don&#039;t know of the quality. I know you said ship within U.S., but if you want an unbelievable experience, order from DrAmsterdam. His shit will strap a rocket to your balls. If you&#039;re looking to save money go with DopeBoy. I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s not the purest, but it&#039;s cheap and it&#039;s only from Canada. Take your pick but look on the forums to decide on quality and reputation of the seller.

				It seems as though the Bitcoins are your hurdle....If you look on SR itself in the money section, you can purchase BTC with a Greendot Moneypak, which can be purchased at every Walmart, CVS, 7-11 etc.

Unless you&#039;re talking about BTC fluctuations; those can be a bitch, true..

				Bitcoin fluctuations and service charges from places like get-bitcoin (5% service fee). You could use Dwolla and avoid that fee but you also have to sit around and wait for about a week...
