				Hi all, new to the forum and SR, so if this is covered elsewhere please point me to it but my searches did not yield the info I was after. I have a few q&#039;s if anyone will help it is much appreciated.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for top quality coke. UK to UK as I don&#039;t want to risk long delivery times and customs (unless people think EU to UK is fine?). Price isn&#039;t so much of an issue, so long as it&#039;s good. There are vendors claiming they are selling pretty much pure coke. Is this for real, or are most of these guys cutting it to a point and just advertising it as so?<br /><br />From what is available, it looks like a toss up between dmtdoodeelsd or dreamgreen. edit - I&#039;ll post in rumour mill for info on these<br /><br />Also, I have used topix a few times to score before I found SR (not coke) and it worked well. On there, you get specific feedback threads on forums for vendors which I like, often encouraged by the vendors. Is there something similar here? I couldn&#039;t find anything, and the rumour mill seems very general, ie lots of vendors and products mixed up.<br /><br />Thanks for any help

				Hey dude, I&#039;m a long time snorter! an naturally when i stumbled upon SR I bought from a few uk coke vendors. Cause of my job I can&#039;t risk messin with customs...<br /><br />There isn&#039;t 1 coke vendor on here who has pure coke as they claim. there are a very selected few in Europe who from time 2 time have very high quality 60 -70%, but that is in very limited supply and is usually sold very quickly, going to a select chosen few. The mainstream coke on here is about 40-50% from certified sellers with good feedback.<br /><br />If you read the feedback of the vendors fully you&#039;ll realize that their coke isn&#039;t what it&#039;s claimed. This is cuz alot of people, especially new users, don&#039;t know what quality coke is like so just write that it&#039;s good stuff. There is few sellers who don&#039;t romanticize and exaggerate the quality of their product and if they don&#039;t then it&#039;s reflected in their prices...<br />So i would suggest you find one of these sellers who sells good quality coke for a nice price. that way you can get more....with snow, more is better. only if it is snow...instead of you paying more for something that is no way 80% or whatever is being claimed. <br /><br />hope my lill rant helps..cuz if some told me this before, I know it would&#039;ve saved me a lot of money buying bullshit, which I was led to believe had just apparently landed in the country and had been untouched by any1. my fukkin arse....&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				EU to UK is fine - I&#039;ve only had a problem once.<br /><br />I recommend &#039;LloydsBrothers&#039; - there stuff is good quality, kinda&#039; expensive but it&#039;s worth it if you like your coke.
