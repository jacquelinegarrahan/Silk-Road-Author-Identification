				Is it just me or is there anybody else think that way?<br /><br />A Karma system need a comment to the karma. So u can see who gave the karma and specially WHY. actually people doing -karma for no obvious reason infact i got 2x - karma for my own non offended opinion. they probably dont even know the reason themselves but because they dont have to give a reason they just go and do it for whatever reason but not what its supposed to be. <br />when i started here i was very curious and gave alot less attention to peoples post when they had alot of -karma because i thought i can give a thing about it. man was i wrong.2 days later some people seem to have nothing better to do as to give away -karma for no reason. also they dont state another reason in the thread they gave me the -karma for. how? and whys that? (there was some scammer in the thread, wrote a post before me. he had selling prices of 90$ per 10 bitcoins in his signature. THIS guy actually had only 1 -karma. me the one who give a reason to everything he posts get 2x - karma without stating a reason for it or to rectify me when they think i have written something wrong they should probably go ahead and rectify me instead of giving a karma?<br />the -karma makes no sense at all here. its just to confuse people not more not less. u can not give a little thing about it. u know in the internet there are places u pay 5$ for others peoples registering in a forum and make 100 quality posts. if i want to harm somebody ill just go and get like 5-10 of this accounts and fill them with -karmas and nobody can ever tell if they are real or not.<br /><br />if however u have to give a reason for it, and the karma will point to the thread the karma was given to, u can go and check if this was a legit karma. not even that hard to get this as a html code (1 minute google).<br /><br />people will think twice if they give a karma for no reason because they know their words weight less and less by every wrong given karma point.<br />it would be easy for everyone to tell if their tons of + karmas are legit.<br /><br />i can tell u atleast 3 solid points why the karma system here is bad. can u give me just one legit point of why the actual karma system is better than what i suggested? (instead of just giving -karma?? <br /><br />i know all the immature kids will now make -karmas rain at me because i made a thread out of it :D&nbsp; these karmas will just proof my point.<br /><br />

				Wikked, I totally agree. <br />See my thread &#039;&#039;directions to Johnsonstreet&#039;&#039;<br />With many, many thanks to Rewrite for making it so much more understandable.<br />For the people saying &#039;&#039;you take this way to serious&#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp;Its not about the - karma, it is the irritation that people for no reason can give that, for them it means something or else they wouldn&#039;t have given the -<br />Add a small comment to the + or - makes it more valuable I think. Now its often used to punish people who in general have no clue what they&#039;ve done wrong. (exactly as I point out in directions to Johnsonstreet)<br />&nbsp;

				Like any other community, the Silk Road community has plenty of nice and cool people, and its share of assholes as well.<br /><br />Some of these assholes have more than 100 posts, which makes them qualified to give out karma.<br /><br />Just accept it and move on.

				who are you going to buy from? <br /><br />tbh, i dont know! because it seems like more than average of people giving out karmas doing so for fun or whatever reason. i have done nothing wrong, i have not insulted anyone in any way but i got -5 (or now even more) -karmas. so if i judge by that i should probably choose the one with more -karmas?!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95374.msg676895#msg676895">Quote from: wikked on December 22, 2012, 06:49 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">why not try and make it better?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Such as.......?<br /><br />Such as providing a link, a reason and a name to the post that got the karma. so as a possible customer u can make up ur decision by looking these kind of things up to be more accurate. this would actually make a lot of sense. but a bunch of fanboy kids who crackup their brains with all kind of drugs going around pulling karmas out with no sense whatsoever just doesnt make any sense and makes me questioning the situation. as a seller i would sure not post a single post in this forum because it could hurt my business because of some degenerated fools...a transparent karma system would come close to a seller feedback page. an untransparent karma system just not helping anybody<br /><br />

				It&#039;s not required, but I give the name and reason of whom I give it to on my post just as a heads up. I&#039;ve given way more good K (about 40) than bad K (a mere 2). Like Jesse said, it can sometimes affect a vendor&#039;s business if you&#039;re deciding on a new seller.

				If you&#039;re a vendor, a competing vendor could leave you -karma just because they can. Some might even make it a point to do so. <br /><br />So the karma system isn&#039;t a reliable guide to judge someone&#039;s character over. Someone might have come up with an idea that everyone hated at first but after fleshing it out a bit more, now like it. <br /><br />All kinds of reasons -Karma is doles out. <br /><br />Yes, it would be better if one could see who left it. There would probably be less -karma given out if it were. Except in the case of trolls. It&#039;s a matter of pride and community duty to smack a troll with -karma. It sure beats arguing with a troll.
