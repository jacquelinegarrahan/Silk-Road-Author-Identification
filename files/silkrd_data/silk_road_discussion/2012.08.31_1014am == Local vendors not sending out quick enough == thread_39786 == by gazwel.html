				Anyone else find this a massive pain in the arse? I really wish vendors would put on their page if it&#039;s going to take a few days to send, you pick local because you want it delivered fast. Been waiting for 3 days on two vendors to send and now it looks like I won&#039;t get it this week:(<br /><br />I have ordered from abroad and received it quicker and I get more for my coin than I do with local vendors, sometimes I just want it sent as soon as possible so I order locally and most of the time it has been sent out that day or the next. But sometimes the order can sit there for days with nothing happening despite the vendor signing in every day.<br /><br />Please vendors, if you are not going to send within a day or two at least send a message and let us know.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m never in a rush when i place orders, it gets here when it gets here...<br /><br />but i do sympathize a bit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve ordered from a vendor that lives a little over an hour away from me and waited a week, whereas another vendor lives 3000 miles away and gets it to me in two days, both with normal first-class shipping.

				You may not agree with this because everybody wants their shit in 10 minutes but one of the things I like about SR is that its out of my hands for a couple of days. Rather than willing my cell phone to ring, calling the # over &amp; over, or waiting for hours at your favorite street corner you go about your business &amp; wait for the fucking mail. Nothing you can do to make it come any faster or make the vendor get their ass to the po the day you order from them. Granted it sucks if you order something on a Friday for the NEXT weekend &amp; it doesnt arrive in time but oh well.

				What I hate is when vendors put your item in transit before it is. Thats all I got :)

				Hello Gazwel, i noticed your thread and thought this might be in regards to your current order with yourself. I just thought i would say it does say on my profile under the purchasing &amp; processing section <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;I aim for same day/next day postage!<br />Please allow me up to four days to get your order sent out, this is the maximum time allowed on Silk Road before the order is marked as late. I do aim to have your order out withing 24hrs but sometimes there can be delays due to high volumes of orders and life commitments, I am only human, so please do not mark me down if it takes four days to get your order in transit.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It also does say in my second last status update at the top of my profile that it will 100% take me 48hrs to process orders at the moment due to life commitments. The order was placed on the 29th and shipped on the 31st within the 48hr timeframe that i had specified. Again sorry for the delay but i have life commitments at the moment, i have worked solidly on SR for over a year now and i jsut cannot donate the time i use to be able to, sorry about this. I hope you enjoy your product when it arrives and sorry for the delay but my profile did say.
