				First of all I apologize for the thread and caps in the title but I want to get a mods attention.<br /><br />Originally known as doublemint, Chronic Smern as he is now known, is a scammer who is constantly changing his user handle in order to retain his senior status in the hopes that users don&#039;t notice (his handle has been changed multiple times in the past week alone). He has been responsible for a good amount of the spamming and scams in the past week or so (probably longer) and has nearly 400 posts gained in less then a month and a half, obviously to try to gain some rep in as short of time as possible. <br /><br />I doubt this will go anywhere but I can&#039;t stand seeing users scammed (even if it is their fault that they allowed the scamming to happen) by this guy. Even if someone makes a thread warning that someone is a scammer, the scammer can simply change their username, thereby easily avoiding being associated with being a scammer. SR please delete this guys forum account and disable the ability for users to change their handle.<br /><br />thank you for reading.
