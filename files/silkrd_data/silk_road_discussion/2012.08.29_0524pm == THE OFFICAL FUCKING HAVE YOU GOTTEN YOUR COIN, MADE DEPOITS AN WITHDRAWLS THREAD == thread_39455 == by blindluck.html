				I sent a message to Vendor Support regarding the missing withdrawals.&nbsp; I have not received a reply.&nbsp; I suppose they are reviewing the data?&nbsp; Even so, I think it would be gracious to the community if DPR indicated what caused the &#039;error&#039;.&nbsp;

Stop posting your shit all over the place, it&#039;s getting very annoying for everybody. If you&#039;ve messaged SR Support about your issue it&#039;ll be sorted as soon as they get around to it. If you haven&#039;t, then I recommend you do so.

				Got my coins back MANY hours ago. They are fixing the problem but think of how many hundred messages they must go through to ensure everyone&#039;s is fixed! I&#039;m sure the vendor&#039;s were taken care of first because we all had a lot of coins &quot;lost&quot; but I was credited for them with an apology letter from DPR which makes me feel very good knowing they actually care so much to fix this problem and I have since made 3 cashout&#039;s today and all of them working VERY fast :) Have no fear! Everything is fixed and it&#039;s business as usual!

				NO. I have been waiting 3 days for a withdrawal. I received one response from SR support saying it was being looked into, and that was all it said. Almost 72 hours, and 300+ btc disappeared.

				Silkroad gave me my coins back a long time ago. If you didn&#039;t write to them with the exact time, date, amount of coins withdrawn and the wallet address it was sent to it is not going to be fixed for you. Some withdrawals were working during the time they had the problems so it is probably hard/impossible for them to know if yours didn&#039;t work if you don&#039;t bring it to their attention.. You MUST write to them and if you waited this long to do so that&#039;s not very smart.......They took care of every vendor/buyer I know and some were cashing out over 1000BTC so I&#039;m sure they will take care of you all if you just write to them with ALL the details..
