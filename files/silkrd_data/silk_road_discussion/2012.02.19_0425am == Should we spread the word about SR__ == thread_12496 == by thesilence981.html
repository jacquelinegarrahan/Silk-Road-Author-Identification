				See...I&#039;m still new, so my opinion doesn&#039;t really matter :P<br /><br />But I was told about the site by a friend of mine about a month ago. So I&#039;m, by default, pro growth. <br /><br />Some growth is definitely a good thing. But from what I&#039;ve read this place has already grown exponentially in a small period of time. I think I remember reading that it has over 10,000 members now? That&#039;s a pretty big deal when you consider what 90% of the business on here is for. ::)<br /><br />At the same time...maybe too much growth could be a bad thing. If traffic to the site was growing at an alarming rate, I&#039;m sure there would be some way to spot it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think LE is too concerned with SR right now because it isn&#039;t really too HUGE of a problem yet. <br /><br />Then again, I&#039;m a newbie so what do I know?&nbsp; :P

				Over 10,000?!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />If you go by UserID it has about 170,000. Taken to account that many have 2 or more accounts, that means around 85K users.<br />Even a smaller concurrent site has about 45,000 (22.5K under same logic).

				There is a good side and a bad side to telling others about the Silk Road. The bad side is it will bring more scammers and probably more LEO. But the good side is, the larger our community is at the time &quot;The Man&quot; tries to take us down, the harder it will be for them. Then again, if we become a community of bad people and scammers, LEO would probably use that to turn the uneducated masses against us in the end... But I don&#039;t really know, I feel like we do a pretty good job here of weeding out the stupid people. Especially with our escrow system, if people would use it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t tell everyone I know about the Silk Road, but I&#039;ve introduced a few people who I&#039;m close to. I don&#039;t think you should put up fliers around town advertising our existence, but I don&#039;t think it should be kept a secret either. Moderation is a word used alot here, lol.. I think the same applies in this case...

				I think the time of the lone-operating vendor is nearly over. Vendors are going to have to run as organised corporations if they are going to be able to cope with the increasing demand. Individuals aren&#039;t going to be able to fulfill 100+ separate orders per day, and they won&#039;t be able to compete on pricing/quality if they place limits on their demand. <br /><br />In answer to your question, I think we should spread the word. Anyone who disagrees is either a vendor who sees the above as a problem, or buyers who are irrationally scared that growth will end this experiment. <br /><br />The real Achilles heel of the Silk Road is its reliance on Bitcoin and in turn Bitcoin&#039;s reliance on Banks and other major corporations to facilitate its exchange to major currencies. The exchange of Bitcoin could easily be made illegal under the pretense of Money laundering uses etc. <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any harm in telling your trusted friends and acquaintances about it, particularly if they, too, engage in the occasional unsanctioned chemical adventure - but do it in such a way that you&#039;re just passing on some knowledge that SR exists, not that you&#039;ve ever actually bought or sold anything on the market.&nbsp; IMHO, it&#039;s fine that more people know that SR exists, but what any of us actually do or do not do here - well, that&#039;s nobody&#039;s business but our own.

				I say keep it on the DL, the less people know about it the less time everyone including higher up people in society will take to find out about it and how it works. Obviously they already know about it but the smaller it stays the less they will try to crack down on it. Just my opinion though.

				I was wondering that myself. I heard about &quot;some website&quot; my neighbor was talking about around spring, this time, last year. It seems that this website was destined to travel quick. I&#039;ve only told my closest friend, but haven&#039;t told them what they need to do to get here. They probably wouldn&#039;t even understand this stuff anyway.

				No need to spread the word. As SR has said the die has already been cast.&nbsp; Anybody who really wants to find this place will the rest don&#039;t need to know.I wouldn&#039;t ell anybody, because frankly I like the anonymity. I love the fact that nobody knows me and I don&#039;t know them. I&#039;m not against growth, but I&#039;m not planning on aiding it.&nbsp; Hell, with the mainstream meidia, crongress, and the Justice Dept. already on this, SR probably isn&#039;t long for this world anyway. I&#039;m getting while the getting is good then getting out before shit hits the fan.

				I think we should tell as many people as possible about SR because an increased customer base will attract more vendors which in turn will increase supply and competition which will mean better prices for SR customers.<br /><br />A drastic increase in SR trades(like tentfold) could also very well improve stability of bitcoin currency which is surely positive.<br />

				No, personally I only tell friends and the like about SR if I think they can handle the info. (bit arrogant on my part&nbsp; :-[ , I know) The SR service offers the good, bad and ugly and I think it (the merchandise) can do serious damage in the wrong hands. I do not wish to be responsible indirectly for this damage. <br /><br />It is a bit like handing children the keys to a sweet shop, not all kids can handle it, sorry to say. I would like to meet people on SR with some brain and sense, and an interest in drugs for the right reasons, as opposed to self destruct. <br />

				I sort of agree with the poster above, not necessarily because people will have an issue using SR from an ability point of view, but I think along with SR comes the other aspects of Tor - CP, conspiracy theories, etc etc. I feel a certain amount of compartmentalizing has to take place in order to ignore all that other stuff, or at least for me, otherwise it makes me really sad (what can I say, I&#039;m against the abuse of children and animals!).<br /><br />I have one friend who really wants to know where I&#039;m getting stuff from but I can&#039;t tell her because I know she&#039;d have a huge issue with the other stuff on here.<br /><br />One of my issues is just pure laziness in explaining it all to someone who has never encountered anything like it before. BTC, PGP, TOR, etc. If someone wants something specific I&#039;d probably say &quot;I can get it for you&quot; (if it&#039;s something often sold here) but other than that I believe in the protective power of silence.<br /><br />Although, that said, I&#039;m purely a buyer, I might think differently if I were a vendor.

The clearnet seems so small to me that I never really encountered anything using run of the mill searches that I&#039;d find problematic.

DO NOT PROMOTE the SR WEBSITE!!! Don&#039;t bring sand to the beach. People WILL FIND US. WE ALL MADE IT! So will others. PROMOTE THE BITCOIN!! Grow the economy. More people that buy btc the better.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; Work smart not hard and foolishly!! <br /><br /><br />Hello LE,<br />&quot;I&#039;m spreading the word about my favorite website.....&quot;<br />Okay, we all can agree that will be a VERY bad situation for anyone to be in.&nbsp; So don&#039;t find yourself in it. EPIC FAIL!!! The silver bracelets are not werewolf protection and watch your ass around your new cellmate&nbsp; :&#039;( <br /><br />Hello LE,<br />&quot;I&#039;m spreading the word about the bitcoin. BTC. It&#039;s a digital internet commodity available to you.&quot; Absolutely nothing wrong or illegal about it. You can go in many different directions with the conversation. SMART. PROMOTE THE BITCOIN&nbsp; ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very true.<br /><br />Feed some info about BTC to the inquisitive mind, and if he/she is looking hard enough they will find SR all on their own. <br /><br />I would NEVER give out the details of Silk Road to anyone IRL. There a currently two close friends that know I can get high quality goods delivered right from the internet; but nobody has the slightest clue about SR, BTC, Tor, etc etc. This way I reap the benefits of middle-man when I order for others, and I do my part in keeping SR a secret. It&#039;s a win-win situation folks.<br /><br /><br />Loose lips sink ships. Silence is golden people. <br /><br />I agree new buyer accounts should be shut down for a while, or come with a price-tag to keep the influx of new buyers down. SR is growing too big for its own good, and I fear the owner/operators of this site are not investing NEARLY enough time/money/resources into SECURITY. With this new fee structure, and all this new found cash I&#039;d seriously hope SR is investing every resource available to them into keeping this shit secure and anonymous. <br /><br />Make no mistake about it, shit will hit the fan here very soon if things keep up at the current rate.<br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t read this whole thread but I found this site searching Google for &quot;Where to buy cocaine&quot; ....I honestly didn&#039;t expect to actually find a useful answer but there it was.....some news story (gawker I think?) And even then I thought it wouldn&#039;t be easy but it was. <br />I searched for silk road and some nice webpage gave me all the info I needed..... 15 min later I&#039;m here and buying bitcoins. It really isn&#039;t hard since those articles were written. Anyone semi able to use a PC and the web can find it. I haven&#039;t told anyone though.

				Hahaha! No thanks on the Natalie Imbruglia mate. You can keep that one.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t see the problem in telling INTELLIGENT people about the road. Its definitely not something you wanna tweet about or make into a FB status update. But, If you know someone who has the brainpower to use Tor and BTC properly, and feel that they would be respectful, courteous members of this exceptional community of like minded people; then tell them. <br /><br />I for one am extremely grateful that my buddy mentioned this place to me. Id much rather place an order for my favorite substances,&nbsp; knowing that my product is going to be legit, and sit back and wait for it to come to me; as opposed to going to a dealers house/frantically calling around to get the hook up.&nbsp; I can just go to work, come home and check the mail. <br /><br />This place truly is a blessing!

				Lets face it, the war on drugs has been lost by the authorities worldwide. Hard as they try, they will never win. Plain and simple. The Rd is just another example of how that war is being lost, and will continue to be lost. If the road goes down, something else will take its place. Its time the muppets at the top all over the world (esp the fucking Yanks) realized that this is the real world. People want to get high. I work hard, I pay large taxes, its my choice.<br /><br />My personal experience is that I&#039;m getting a much more quality product here than I would otherwise, even if the cost is slightly higher. <br /><br />Long Live The Road.
