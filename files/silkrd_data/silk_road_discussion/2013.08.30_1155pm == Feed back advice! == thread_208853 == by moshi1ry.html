				This is my first post on the forums but i have been lurking and riding the road for 6 months. My stats IMO are pretty good being a buyer and i have never really had any problems with 15+ orders. Also i typically order in bulk. This all changed though with my last package and i have not finalized because i am still unsure of what to leave besides a 1/5 or a 2/5. So insight/advice is welcome since i know leaving that low of a score isnt going to make any friends. Also upon reading other reviews for a 5.0 vendor i see that someone else was shorted as well recently.<br /><br />I had 2 orders with this particular vendor spaced out maybe 4 or 5 days from each other. First one almost did not make it (not vendors fault), the stealth though well there really was not any stealth besides vac seal and ziplock baggy. If anyone opened it would be very obvious. I then proceeded to weigh it out. Always weigh if there is anything ive learned. My first order was short a full 4 grams on a 28 gram order. This concerned me but since the vendors has so many 5/5 reviews and seems like all of his packages make it i decided to order again. He told me that he could include my 4 that he owed me in my next order or he could just send the 4 domestic. I decided not to make him send out another 4 and give him the benefit of the doubt ordering again. <br /><br />The second order was my main concern and has really bothered me even after having it almost a week now. The second order when i walked to my lovely mail box and opened it the chemical smell hit me immediately. I honestly could not believe that this order made it with the smell it was putting off (THANK GOD for lax usps!). Then i proceeded to notice that there was no return address? I have read the postal profiling page like many of you, i am sure and having a return address on an international package definitely makes it less sketchy according to what I have read.<br /><br />Now when i open the package there is a hole about the size of a penny through the vac seal and there were many holes in the zip lock bag. Also the product was sticky and wet normally i would not care since its easy to let evaporation do its thing but that was really the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Finally i weigh it out and it comes to 27.5. My second order according to the vendor before he sent it would be 32 grams. 28+4 owed=32, wrong. At this point im just kind of pissed. Also upon trying to resolve these issues with the vendor in a completely &quot;polite&quot; tone as DPR would say he sent me this message. &quot;OK let me put it this way. I think you are a lying scammer and I don&#039;t care what you have to say.&quot;.<br /><br />Anyone else have any order go this bad, it really sucks because the product is amazing and so is the shipping time. <br /><br />

				Did you receive your product? Yes. Right there helps towards your review. a 1/5 should really only be used if you didn&#039;t receive your order which does happen a lot.<br /><br />What I think you should do if you haven&#039;t is send the vendor a message and he would probably want to make you whole by sending you the 8 grams or whatever, then you leave a 5/5 and never do business with him again.<br /><br />If you are looking for some international Hash from a vendor who actually keeps up with MBB&#039;s, correct procedure of return addresses etc. Check out The Scurvy Crew

				If only you could read the PMs between me and this vendor you would understand. There is no resolution with him. After talking to him further today he tells me that the holes in the packaging are caused by customs poking through and causing the holes. Also apparently i just need to SCRAPE the bag to get the 4 grams out. Blowing smoke up my ass to get me to finalize if you ask me. Like who doesnt scrape a bag of hard drugs anyhow??? Guess ill just throw this bag away with drugs in it.<br /><br />Would the resolution center be a wise decision at all. Also i have given vendors 5/5 before even when the package did not come because i know that it was usps fault and we came to an agreeable resolution. I think even if it does come it could still deserve a 1/5 hell it should have put me in jail.

				Don&#039;t do 1/5 unless it&#039;s laced with cyanide lol<br /><br />Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.<br /><br />Scrape weed out of a bag is insane, for either good weed or mexi brick<br /><br />Sounds like a crap vendor, still think 3 or above is appropriate... But with a comment describing everything.&nbsp; BTW nothing illegal about posting all PMs here<br /><br />Don&#039;t think someone sending you that crap would put you in jail, you have deniability especially when it&#039;s packed like that. Tell the police you know nothing and someone is trying to put you in jail simple enough.

Doesn&#039;t that defeat the whole feedback system? The purpose of it is to rate your transaction with him so that other people can gauge if they want to do business with him or not.&nbsp; He not had only one order come in short BUT TWO! Then, on top of that, the stealth/packaging was horrible. This guys shorts him and puts his freedom at risk and you want to give him a 5/5?
