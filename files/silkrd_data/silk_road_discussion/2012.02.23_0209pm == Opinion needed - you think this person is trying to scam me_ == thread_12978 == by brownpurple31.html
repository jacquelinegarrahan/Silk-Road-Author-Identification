				Normally I don&#039;t come here to start shit, but this morning I saw a message which really confused me and managed to piss me off at the same time.<br /><br />First, here&#039;s the message I received: &quot;Shipping came to me completely damaged with empty content!!! You uses a very dangerous method of packing! I will have a problems if the post office became aware that they go to my address illegal shipment! I was unblocking your escrow before getting the shipment, but in this situation demands immediate refund(at least 70% of 12.06 BTC! ), otherwise I will not have to give you good feedback.<br /><br />Regard&quot;<br /><br />Now, I have ZERO records of the username who sent the message to me (they never purchased anything from me under that account name). I also have no idea what the person is talking about... Their English is confusing.<br /><br />I told the person to respond with an order number and a better explanation because everyone else who has ordered something from me (especially the item they asked about) has received it fine without any problems.<br /><br />What&#039;s everyone else&#039;s opinion on this?

				I am interested - as a seller can you see how many transactions buyers have done?&nbsp; I made my first and the seller was totally happy even when I said I must stick to escrow etc.&nbsp; But I could have been a scammer for all he knew?

				I know when I look at my purchasing stats, I can see total spent, amount of transactions, auto finalise rate, refund rate and how long I&#039;ve been a member. I think the sellers get most of this, but I remember Christy Nugs and someone else talking on here a few days back, and she said she didn&#039;t get all of the info. I&#039;m sure sellers see amount of transactions, refund rate and auto-finalise rate, more than that I don&#039;t know.
