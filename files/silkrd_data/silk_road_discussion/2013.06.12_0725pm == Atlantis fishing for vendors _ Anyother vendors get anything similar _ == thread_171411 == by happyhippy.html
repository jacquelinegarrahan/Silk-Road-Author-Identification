I don&#039;t know... everything on there seems retail as well, not much wholesale or anything. This is probably why they&#039;re so desperate... :P<br /><br />This site is named after a trade-route that stirred up cultural advancement that lead to the modern world. <br />Their site is named after a city, that supposedly sank to the bottom of the Sea.<br /><br />Which sounds more secure to you? lol<br /><br />

				I could start a website and call it decapitatedthroatfuckers.org and sell buttplugs and dental floss so I don&#039;t think the name has much to do with it. I think they saw an opening with SR downtime and now they need new sellers to cover overhead.

				Yes, DPR did.. but he had also made it clear that the person whom he would hire would be in no way to compromise the &quot;safety and security&quot; of SR. So I trust that. I do remember at the time there was an uproar, and DPR cleared it out that it wouldnt jeopardize anything. And also that he was &quot;blown away by the calibre of applicants&quot;. I imagine some serious, hardcore, life long IT geniuses probably applied. And why not? A job is a job is a job.

				FWIW, Atlantis emphatically denies being behind this. Someone suggested it might be a person trying to get the marketing job (which has been filled) and the Atlantis admins said that anyone using those tactics would have no chance anyway.<br />

				I checked them out but lost all respect for them when their so called CEO did a question, answer session on reddit, imo thats just asking to get busted and putting all your vendors and buyers at risk at the same time. Not sure what they are thinking doing things like that on the clearnet.
