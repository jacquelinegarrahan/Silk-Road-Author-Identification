				i recently made a purchase that i was forced to finalize early on and left good feedback, however i&#039;ve changed my mind about how this transaction has gone, im pretty sure i got robbed by a highly touted guy with great feedback (no wonder why). i was wondering, if i don&#039;t get my shit by monday, is there a way to change the feedback i left? or how do i go about this situation? it&#039;s been a week since it got &quot;shipped&quot; and only has to go 6 states away. oh, and he won&#039;t reply to my message i sent, but checks on here daily.

				Yes you can - go to your accounts page, clicky on the view feedback link, and you can see and edit all your feedback entries.<br /><br />That said, it&#039;s waaaaaaaaaaay too soon to be doing that in the middle of the Christmas mail rush. It can take 10 days or more for a first class letter to travel 100 miles this time of year. Be a wee bit more patient. You&#039;ll look quite the fool if you fuck with his/her feedback and receive your mailing the next day.<br /><br />As to not responding, if it&#039;s sent, all he can respond with &quot;It&#039;s been sent!&quot; A top vendor may get well over 100 PMs in a day, and between answering PMs that have legitimate inquiries and sending out orders, I&#039;d not be surprised if they didn&#039;t answer ones that they really can&#039;t give you any more information than you already have.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s annoying as shit waiting for an order to arrive, and I feel your pain, but honestly it&#039;s premature to take any action besides camping by your mail box and perhaps muttering some ancient mail-speeding enchantments under your breath. Lots of time later to shit all over the vendor if he really did fuck up. Give it a few more days.&nbsp; ;)

				yeah ive been doing everything, i&#039;m gonna wire a doorbell to my damn mailbox so i know when its opened pretty soon, it&#039;s even worse when youre a dopesick piece of shit junky waiting to get something just to feel better<br /><br />the whole shipping thing is baffling me though, my friend ordered something from here, from germany, and got it 2 days after it shipped, a 3 day process. i just feel like i&#039;m getting a run around, and it&#039;s getting old fast, my state of mind doesn&#039;t help either i suppose, thanks alot for the help though, i will wait it out for a bit longer, points will be docked for bad communication though :)

				That&#039;s the spirit!<br /><br />And never underestimate the complexities of the postal system. I mailed a First Class order on Tuesday from the UK, it got there Saturday morning, 4 days. Eleven fucking days ago I mailed an Airsure Priority with Track and Track and bells and whistles and shit for an extra Â£8, to an address not 20 miles from the same spot. Still not fucking there. Worse, it was a Christmas gift for a mod, hard to fuck up worse than that.<br /><br />So believe me, I feel your pain, and will burn a scrap of a Posties uniform in effigy for you. I&#039;ve been saving it for just such an occasion.

				If someone has finalized early and edits feedback when order is received, lets say after few days, does it reset the feedback freshness time?<br />I&#039;m wondering if those feedbacks are real.

				That&#039;s why it should be a rule against making us newbies finalize early.....
