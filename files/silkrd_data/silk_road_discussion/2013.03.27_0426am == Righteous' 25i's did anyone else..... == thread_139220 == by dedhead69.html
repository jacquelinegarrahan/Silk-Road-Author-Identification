				Ok so I went to Ultra and on day 3 I decided to take a tab I got from righteous.&nbsp; I put it in between my front bottom gum and lip, I left it there for I want to say about 45 mins.&nbsp; Not even an hour later I started tripping major balls and I could see the bass in the air at Ultra Korea, it was so intense I sat down at the top of the hill by the bushes just tripping major balls....<br /><br />Well I want to know if anyone experienced any of these 2 things....<br />1. I tripped from about 645-650pm til about 6-7 AM!!!!! Who else has tripped that long off of 25i&#039;s? Is it even possible?<br />2. Did anyone experience any pain where they put the tab?&nbsp; The bottom of my bottom front teeth and my lip was hurting for about 2 days.&nbsp; Touching that area with my tongue was so painful I could barely talk and just putting my finger outside my mouth (on my skin) hurt.<br /><br />I found this to be very weird considering Ive tried 25i before and it lasted for about 6 hours... and never has the area of where I put the tab hurt.... Im very curious to find out if anyone has experienced this or if I am just super fucking sensitive to drugs.<br /><br />I also tried the purple party flocks... they suck... I didnt roll off them, just puked

				Yeah 25i is very powerful.<br /><br />I took 1 tab, tripped ~8 hours, then the next day 2 tabs (against my better judgement knowing how tolerance builds), and tripped even harder. Very fun experiences both times.

Nbomes are dangerous if you OD! If they are way stronger than they are said to be or have hot-spots its not free drugs but dangerous.

				Yes and Yes OP.. The boomers are fucking dangerous imo.<br /><br />One time that i rolled wayy too hard for like 16 hours was on 2 800ug complexed tabs of 25c, and it was too much too much. Another time on 2 1000ug non complexed 25i tabs, and it didnt last more than 12 hours, or maybe it did, i was just exhausted and was able to sleep eventually, but that night for the entire 12 hours i had that incredibly wretched taste of nbome in my mouth allll night, no mattetr what i ate or drank was taken by that taste, cigs, water, fruits candys everything, it was a nightmare. Every time i take an nbome tab, it leaves my mouth (where the tab was held) terribly sore, almost as if the tab burned the skin there. Ive only droped a handful of them, and i have like 25 hits of 25c from nevita still, cause ive grown to hate them, yes it CAN be fun, and yes they make you trip ballskis, butt.. its ugly.<br /><br />&nbsp;As for the party flocks, i seen your thread about it. I have never taken them, but i can only assume that you did infact roll cause of all the heaving and vomiting you did. Maybe theres a chance that what you where waiting for was actually not the feeling that MDMA gives? Im not shooting you down, i just find it hard to believe that some one sold bunk pressed pills on SR. If they wher bought on the street i wouldnt doubt you for a second. Aside from that, theres no point other than novelty, to buy pressed MDMA pills, when there sooo much good MDMA raw on the Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;Any how, good luck in your travels dude.

				But no one actually had pain in the area of where you put the tab?&nbsp; <br /><br />Ive tried 25i before but I guess these are just stronger<br /><br />I sold to a group of kids from Colorodo and they came back to the hotel swarming my room telling me of how that was the best trip they ever had, made me happy =)

If it was truly painful this makes me think that the dose was too large, especially since you say it felt that way.

				Yea your probably right, it might have been too strong, I also have a VERY VERY VERY LOW tolerance to any substance considered a drug.<br /><br />The weird part though was the Colorado kids i sold to, about 1 or 2 of them tripped for the first time in their lives! and they popped 2 tabs each at the same time, and they felt fine, tripped for not too long and were able to fall asleep easily.. <br /><br />Ill prob never find out, but Ill just go with, too strong for me =) no complaints there shit... cheaper for me haha

				I&#039;ve tried Righteous tabs and they were just fine for me (and other people). Just a bitter taste and mild numbness, which isn&#039;t a big deal. My one friend claimed to not have tripped from it, but he&#039;s an idiot, and I didn&#039;t have time to properly demonstrate to him how to drop it.
