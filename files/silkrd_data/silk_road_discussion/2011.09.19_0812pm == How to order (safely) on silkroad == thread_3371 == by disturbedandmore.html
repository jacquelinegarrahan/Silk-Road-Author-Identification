				I have things I want to buy on the site but to be honest am getting a little nervous about it. At first I was thinking nothing about it but now the thought of actually possibly getting caught is sinking in. Im not to worried about ordering from inside the US because thats were Im located and they have no way of checking inside packages right? But when I want to order cannabis from canada that is a little bit more risky imo because it has to go through customs. But anyways how can I safely order from the site. VPN? encrypt address? I really have no other address I can ship it to besides my own so that also makes me a little nervous. Let me know what you think.

				The US Post Office does have a way of checking inside packages, but the common wisdom seems to be if you order from a US seller (and you are in the US) the chance of detection is less.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, use PGP when sending a seller your address, just to be on the safe side.&nbsp; You&#039;re taking a risk having your package sent to any address, so you have a reason to be nervous.&nbsp; But using a trusted seller with a good track record means you are probably safe.
