				So, if the fight is against CP then why are your targeting silk road? Most users on here neither support nor advocate CP. I think the fight against CP is a good idea, And as someone said a 1% fee to fight it would probably be accepted by all. But targeting Silk Road is not getting your point across, as i suggested the hidden wiki is a better target, they point to CP sites and even have there own sections for it. <br /><br />I agree with most of what Anonymous does, but this attack does not seem well planned or thought out. Most users here would be happy to help if CP is the target.<br /><br />I suggest you end the DDoS on the Silk Road and target The Hidden Wiki, specifically their Hard Candy and Jailbait sections, and the sites within these areas. You could also give instructions in how to participate in these DDoS on this forum, explaing a denial of service against CP and i&#039;m sure more than a few users would be happy to help.<br /><br />So, What do you think?<br /><br />

				Anyone here with 10+ posts should not be buying into this. By objecting to the claims of the hoaxer, you&#039;re giving him credit as being anything but fraud. This is very clearly an OP by LE or Religious (anti-drug) group. They are opportunely trying to pit SR against Anon, and some people here have shamefully bought into it.<br /><br />First of all, Anon has their own channels for announcing any kind of ops. Twitter, IRC... *NOT* pastebin: http://pastebin.com/bgY3KFpx<br /><br />Yes that&#039;s right, on *all*of Google there is but *1* sample of the word &quot;WEBLOIC&quot; with &quot;SILK ROAD&quot;. Now the pastebin link is 2 days old. The posts started here just yesterday. People here you should have your BS detectors more finely tuned. Anon does not announce their attack in this method...... Think about it? Who has motive to take down SR..? LE, YES you bet. Religious fanatics (Christian, Muslim), YES you bet. Anon..? *NO* way in hell... An you can sure as hell bet that if Anon did attack, it would be a clean sweep, nothing would load at all.. well why can I log in to forum and SR just fine? Because Anon is nowhere near this. If they were, it would have been utter denial.<br /><br />This is someone semi-smart (yes they have SR suspicious of Anon now, well done [also shame on those who bought it]). Smart but lame..

				ALSO Google this, people: &quot; This was very unnerving because we&quot;<br /><br />Can you see that this message from SR is *3 MONTHS OLD*<br /><br />The trolls are linking a 3 month old SR message to a current, *weak* DDoS.<br /><br />BS detectors people, tune them up. <br /><br />And to call them trolls is an understatement. I will give them credit for fooling a few of the SR members I thought were smarter than this.<br /><br />The best thing you can all do now is STOP saying &quot;aww don&#039;t attack us we got no CP here&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;------ if you say this you are being burned. Anon is not here. This is not about CP! Besides, half the &quot;anti-CP&quot; crowd are closet pedophiles (pedophiles in denial), with nothing better to do than &quot;stumble&quot; on CP sites while on TOR, BUT thats a topic for another day. This is a clever (not really) trick to cause division and confusion. It almost worked! Stay sharp people and call these bluffers for what they are. FRAUD/LE/RELIGIOUS/ wanna be&#039;s.

				Another good reason I support making the forums &#039;pay to play&#039;, same as sellers have to go thru, from when new forums first started, and niggerjim came on here promoting child porn, we periodically get him or one of his boyfriends back here trying to stir up shit.&nbsp; The real anonymous knows we are victims of repressive gov&#039;ts, and have paid--some of us--hard prices because of western gov&#039;t prohibition and antiquated legal notions.<br /><br />Again, when sellers started to have to pay to sell, I figured it would protect us from trolls also, so make forums private requiring donations, is my suggestion.

				CP is some nasty shit but really, you guys could have tested your methods differently. You didn&#039;t have to shove your dicks in our ass to see how bad it would hurt their ass.... and then flaunt yourselves here like that. I love the things you guys do but fuck.... this reminds me of cops beating the shit out of protestors in NY. just to show an example to others, but what about the ones who suffered losses? I think you should just use CP sites strictly when it comes to testing out new tricks. There should not be collateral damage with CP attacks

				Like I said in the outage post, I don&#039;t know whether or not Anon is behind the crash or not. The hidden wiki is down as well, but it&#039;s down all the time so it could be coincidence. I think that testing their new cyber-weapon on something as secure as SR would be a necessary test though, as I&#039;m sure admins here are way better at security than those pedo fucks, so its like &quot;hey if we can take down SR, we sure as hell can take down any CP server that we can find.&quot;<br /><br />I personally think its BS, but would like to believe that all this grief that we users and the admins here on SR, was in an effort to make sure that they have the capacity to bring down these evil bastards, but iits probably not the case. I posted that same pastebin post, then dug around and go into the AnonWiki and they haven&#039;t said anything about it there so... probably just a scare tactic directed at&nbsp; pedo servers and our crash was simply a server problem like our admins have already told us. Who are you going to believe; someone that can post on pastebin(anybody) or SR admin?

This guy obviously has nothing to do with Anon and is just a posing little kid wanting to talk shit anonymously. here&#039;s an idea. If you are anon, pm me my IP address, should be simple for the great anonymous. encrypt it of course, and send it with your PGP key so I can respond and say, okay, you may be part of anon.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying anon wasn&#039;t behind this, and I was the first person to post that pastebin, but like someone here said, anon uses other means to get their messages out besides a site that literally ANYONE can get on and post under ANY name. So yeah, anon may have caused the crash, but you dear, ignorant darknuttsucker, had NOTHING to do with this or any other DDoS attack in your 13 years of life<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, I kind of debated whether or not I should waste my time and post a response to this guy but went against my better judgment.

				SR himself told us this outage was not a result of an attack. I surely believe him (them?) more than I believe a couple jerkoffs that some on a public board claiming to be anons. True anons would never be so careless as to come here and rub it in our faces that they ddos-ed us. Seriously folks, don&#039;t feed the trolls.
