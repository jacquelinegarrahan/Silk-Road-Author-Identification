				Yeah, it has been like this since I tried to get on this morning to check messages. Hopefully it will be back up soon as I&#039;ve seen a few seller threads with new product I want to get in on before they are out.

				I see it, too.<br /><br />No idea when it will be up, hopefully &quot;in a few minutes.&quot;<br /><br />I have to leave for a few hours anyway, sucks I couldn&#039;t send a message to a vendor though before leaving.

				At least they told us about it going down in the forums first (since this is maintenance) .<br />And at least they signed the message on the store&#039;s site.....<br /><br />wait, they didn&#039;t do either of those things? WTF Silk, are you too busy counting your money to inform us and sign your messages?

				same here, <br />but my past experience tells me: relax, read a good book, and check back in a few hours.<br /><br />atm it says: we are down for maintenence. it is taking longer than expected, but we should be back up soon.

				Whatever they did during maintenance seems to have worked.&nbsp; I generally have to cross my fingers as I click a link or call up the URL, but I have had no timeouts that I can recall all day since the maintenance.<br /><br />Has the performance and reliability improved dramatically for anyone else?
