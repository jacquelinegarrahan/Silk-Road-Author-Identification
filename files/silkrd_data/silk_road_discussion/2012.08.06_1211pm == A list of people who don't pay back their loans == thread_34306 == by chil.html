				I was hesitating to post this thread but I thought it could be helpful to a certain extent. As you may have noticed, many people come to the forums to ask for small loans. Yet, some of these people forget their good manners as soon as they get their loan. They tell you, &quot;Ill pay you back with interests and shit&quot; but end up not paying you back at all.&nbsp; For instance, someone asked for a .25 loan 10 days ago.&nbsp; I decided to help him by promptly lending him the coins, which is something I would have appreciated if I was the one who needed cash to complete an order. Short story short, I&#039;ve never heard of him again, despite all my PMs. <br /><br />Contrary to some members here, I have nothing against people needing some last minute spare coins, I think we&#039;ve all been there, and it&#039;s nice to think of SR as a community. Yet, when someone&nbsp; does not pay you back, you don&#039;t feel like lending coins anymore. So, in an attempt of keeping the meaning of &quot;helping each other out&quot; meaningful, I&#039;d like to start a list of people not to be dealt with, unless you enjoy losing hard earned money. <br /><br />1. Forum user: &quot;moneyman&quot;&nbsp; a.k.a Sr user &quot;Freelife1&quot; a.k.a Sr User &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; <br /><br />Feel free to add some more.&nbsp;

				Sorry to hear you have been punked.<br /><br />I&#039;m convinced that the small loans thing should be facilitated as part of the SR account and not just done over the forums or messaging system.<br /><br />SR takes a cut of the interest, debitor gets the funds they want and the creditor gets a greater guarantee of the funds being returned if the debitors accounts reputation is on the line.<br /><br />Everyone wins.

				If you want to give loans give them to people that have been on here for a while. Not like they ever really need extra coin in the first place but....Its nice to help people sure but fuck the noobs. <br />Let it be a lesson learned next time get more! I&#039;ve never had to ask for coins i always make sure to get extra, everyone else needs to learn to do the same.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=34306.msg391718#msg391718">Quote from: MrBelding on August 06, 2012, 03:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">it seems like you&#039;re asking to get scammed by offering loans on an anonymous network<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				As it was said above, for non-noobs, I would&#039;nt mind lending upto a BTC or so, what goes around comes around,<br />im my lil&#039; fantasy world. I just get the shits with noobs with 3 posts ask for 3BTC cos&#039; he&#039; s short for an order.<br />i&#039;d like to believe that when you graudually get familiarised with members, you get an idea of who you could lend a bit to <br />and expext a favour back when you&#039;re in need.<br />My .2BTC

				There are too many people for me to name.<br />&nbsp;<br />I am usually willing to send out a small amount of bitcoins to those who are short for an order. I don&#039;t always expect a repayment, but it&#039;s nice when it does happen. <br /><br />sdesu

				I was short like four btc last night on an order that was being made from change.(I ALWAYS get more than I need.)<br /><br /><br /><br />But.. within 20-30 minutes &quot;Betaraybob&quot; and &quot;Hopeless3&quot;(I think was his/her name.)<br /><br />They both loaned me the btc I needed and I had it returned to them within 18 hours.. but I asked for a 24-48 hour return date.<br />So.. I was honest.. gave them their coins back and way quicker than they expected! Haha.<br /><br />It is definitely hard to judge who will hold their morals high with you though because 75% of us won&#039;t.<br /><br />I definitely ALWAYS will. I always make sure I have coin.. so if I am asking I REALLY need it.<br /><br />Thanks! :)

				I didn&#039;t think anyone ever responded to those posts. I was short .2 a while ago and posted asking for the coin, asked for donation rather than loan to minimize info exchange thinking that might make it more likely i would be helped out. No replies, no surprise. On the other hand, the whole &quot;fuck the noobs&quot; attitude is kind of stupid, as I am not a noob, just a member smart enough to use throwaways and change them regularly. No disrespect to those with the knowledge and confidence to retain the same online identity indefinitely, that&#039;s just not me, and as Clint said &quot;a man&#039;s got to know his limitations.&quot;
