				Hey guys so I know te road can be slow and can some times require a Yoda amount of patience, but for the past 3 days I been trying to log into SR and cant even get to the log in page. I know the site isnt down its just for some reason not loading on my cpu. <br /><br />Any suggestions in terms of best times to try and get on? Does anyone else ever have this long of an issue trying to just load the login in page? <br /><br />I also feel like once I get past the login page then its smooth sailing for the most part. Maybe im using and old log in page?<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/home

				Why can&#039;t you post the fix publicly to help others? Seems a little weird.

				Yeah, fuck that. People spend hundreds of hours on the forum helping others for free, then someone like that comes along and wants to charge.<br /><br />Pro tip: there are no &quot;secrets to making Tor fast&quot;. All info about Tor can found for free. A lot of the advice in &quot;making Tor fast&quot; decreases your safety, like the suggestion to increase entry guards to 8.<br /><br />The best solution is to refresh your list of relays and get a new identity (build a new circuit). If you&#039;re still having trouble connecting, the problem is most likely with the SR server and there&#039;s nothing you can do about that on your end.

				I am unable to sing into my account since the 25th now. I had to make a new account so I could contact my seller to let him know that I could not release the funds for as of yet. Hopefully I can get things sorted before auto FE. Could anyone please help a guy out. Cheers!

				MashupBeatz, does it say invalid login details for the old account? The last time you successfully logged into that account, did you go to SR by clicking the link on Wikipedia?
