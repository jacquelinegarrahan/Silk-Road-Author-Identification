				Article from clearnet: http://teafaerie.org/2013/02/456/<br /><br />The Shulgins need financial help. I felt all of us could donate since they have touched so many of our lives.<br /><br />Its long but please read, there is a bitcoin address coming i will add when i can confirm. <br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />To All Concerned,<br /><br />I am writing this letter in an attempt to inspire right action. As many of you may already know, Ann and Sasha Shulgin are currently suffering from financial distress largely due to Sasha’s increased medical expenses. This lamentable state of affairs is well within our collective powers to redress, and I feel that it is high time for the the psychedelic community to shower our heroic pioneers with a tangible demonstration of our everlasting gratitude.<br /><br />Everybody knows who the Shulgins are. It’s pretty much impossible to overstate their collective contribution to psychedelic culture, and indeed to the very fabric of human society at large. They not only brought us most of our favorite alphabetamines, they tested them on themselves and published their extensive notes so that the rest of us could benefit from their groundbreaking discoveries. Sasha is the greatest psychopharmacological chemist who ever lived. Ann is a pioneer in the field of empthogen-assisted therapy. Their love story has inspired millions of people. And that’s just for starters. Plus they’re also about the kindliest little old couple you’d ever be ridiculously honored to meet! On the few occasions when I’ve had the pleasure of visiting with the Shulgins, I have been deeply moved by the warm affection that flows so palpably between them, as well as by their consistently graceful interactions with awkwardly starstruck admirers like myself.<br /><br />So naturally I was quite shocked when I recently learned that they were genuinely struggling to make ends meet. I was so upset, in fact, that I asked a few close friends of the Shulgins why they didn’t have some kind of a donation link set up or something. Surely, I thought, if they were to appeal to the larger community…<br /><br />It turns out that they’ve been actively soliciting assistance for a while. But so far, the collective largesse of the millions of people who have personally benefited from the Shulgins’ invaluable research hasn’t actually added up to enough to keep pace with one old man’s medical bills and ongoing caretaking costs.<br /><br />I’m going to give the psychedelic community the benefit of the doubt here, and assume that the vast majority of the Shulgins’ innumerable beneficiaries are simply as ignorant about the true nature of the situation as I was. This is obviously at least part of the problem, and this letter is a quick first effort to shine a brighter spotlight upon the matter.<br /><br />However, my letter also endeavors to serve as a frank counterpoint to the immaculately tasteful cries for help that are currently to be found on the Shulgins’ websites. It seems that Ann and the rest of Team Shulgin are simply too reserved, humble, and self-effacing to say some of the things that really need to be said.<br /><br />The Teafaerie, however, suffers from no such conspicuous excess of good manners…<br /><br />Electrical engineer Nicola Tesla was one of the fathers of our time, yet he died in abject poverty. There’s no retirement plan for wizards, it seems; at least not for the kind who are focused on creating change rather than making money. I feel like I’m watching history repeat itself as I write this; except for this time it’s even worse, because there’s no easy scapegoat like Edison in the picture. Everybody knows about the staggering debt we owe to the Shulgins.<br /><br />I feel that failing to take action would reflect pretty poorly on us, actually. Worse yet, I fear that it would reflect poorly on the validity of the Work itself. I mean, if MDMA (for instance) genuinely helps to make us into better, more compassionate people, then how come we’re collectively failing to take care of even the most revered of our elders? Where is all the overwhelming love and the bottomless gratitude that psychedelic aficionados are always waxing so eloquent about?<br /><br />I personally have the Shulgins to thank for many of my most profound and life-changing experiences. Their discoveries and techniques have helped me to heal some of my deepest wounds. They’ve also opened me up to suppressed aspects of my true nature, allowed me to explore and integrate past traumas, catalysed positive transformations in my intimate relationships, showed me how to love myself, humbled me, and taught me how to dance. Nobody can put a price tag on those kinds of things, but I can assure you that no amount of money would persuade me to delete any of those experiences from my memory banks. To be perfectly honest, if it hadn’t been for the Shulgins I sincerely might have killed myself shortly after my best friend passed away a couple of years ago. So I guess that you could say that I owe them just about everything, when it comes right down to it.<br /><br />And I’m just one little person, right? I mean if the Shulgins literally had a dollar for every priceless epiphany that their work has ever helped to bring about, they would obviously be set for life many many many times over. Likewise, if they had a dime for every heart that has ever been opened. Or a nickel for every minor miracle of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual integration. And, of course, if they had even so much as a single penny for every ecstatically transcendent moment on the dancefloor… Well!<br /><br />Paying to see a psychologist for therapy these days usually costs over $100 per 45-minute “hour”. If you are one of the countless thousands of people who have benefited from embracing the DIY alternative to mainstream treatment that Ann and Sasha’s research has helped to facilitate, I encourage you to consider how much money you might have saved over the years. Couldn’t you afford to send the Shulgins a mere 1% of that savings?<br /><br />Plus I know that there are thousands of people out there who have made quite a tidy fortune for themselves in the underground market. Sasha totally could have made big money by creating patentable products for some gigantic pharmaceutical company, you know. But the Shulgins were committed to the open source ethic before it got trendy. Instead of cashing in on their enormously lucrative discoveries, they decided to make their data freely available for the sake of science and society, and at a not-inconsiderable risk to themselves. Wasn’t that ever so progressive of them? And wouldn’t it be aesthetically satisfying if everybody who later made heaps of money off of that data considered just tossing the original content creators a little tip?<br /><br />Ironically, dementia can present exactly like a challenging drug experience at times. And now that Sasha’s legendary mind has been unsettled by this all too common affliction, it feels to me like we’ve collectively been offered a rather poetic opportunity to return a gratuitous grace. MDMA has provided therapeutic benefits to millions of people, allowing them to pull themselves out of very difficult headspaces. And wouldn’t you feel just awesome if you could help to provide the person whose discoveries once brought you some much-needed comfort with quality palliative care and an around-the-clock tripsitter?<br /><br />There’s nothing wrong with enlightened self interest, and charity is the gift that gives back sevenfold. Big donations can get you invited to all the best parties, too! Imagine being introduced as the philanthropist who set the Shulgins up! Or maybe you’re a celebrity yourself, and you’re looking to donate to a cause that you know your fans will be especially proud to support. Social media would certainly be all atwitter about such a simultaneously edgy and genuinely heartwarming display of respect.<br /><br />I know that not everyone can afford to donate as much as they would like. (I can only spare $50 myself at the moment.) There are lots of other ways that you can help, though! How about setting up a “Support the Shulgins” table at your next event, party, conference, or festival? At the very least you can help to raise awareness by reposting this letter. Or, better yet, you could write to your friends and tell them how you feel about this important matter in your own words.<br /><br />We must not let History say that the psychedelic community stood idly by shaking its many heads and clucking its many tongues while Ann and Sasha Shulgin were reduced to poverty. And make no mistake! The eyes of the future are upon us. What we do (or do not do) now shall long be remembered, just as what happened to Nicola Tesla is remembered by us today. Because if there is going to be any kind of a human future at all, I strongly believe that the exploration of consciousness is going to end up being pretty central to its success.<br /><br />Let us act quickly, before we miss our chance to right our collective karma. Let us stand up and show our heroes that they are not forgotten. Think of it as giving them the standing ovation they so richly deserve. Think of it as giving them both a big hug and thanking them for the priceless gifts that they have bestowed upon you, and upon our entire species.<br /><br />This is something that we can accomplish, people. We can even do it fast, if we harness the power of our networks. It’s obviously the right thing to do. And now is the right time to do it. It is our great honor and privilege to be the ones who are in a position to help to give this truly epic love story a happy ending.<br /><br />Donations can be made via credit card or PayPal at: www.shulginresearch.org/home/donate/&nbsp; <br /><br />Cash, check, or money order can be sent to:<br /><br />Sasha Shulgin<br />c/o Transform Press<br />PO Box 13675<br />Berkeley, CA 94712

				Any chance they accept Bitcoin?<br /><br />That would probably give the donations a boost given the nature of his fanbase.<br /><br />Maybe ill shoot them an email asking if they accept bitcoins, or if I can help them set up a wallet of their own

				Copied from clearnet link: http://www.shulginresearch.org/home/donate/<br /><br />March 14 2013:<br /><br />Dear Everyone,<br /><br />Greg Manning, who keeps things on the rails which might otherwise careen in various and occasionally disastrous directions, and who also reminds me of things I’ve forgotten to remember, did another vital job two days ago, pointing out to me that a certain website had information about Sasha which is more than slightly out-of-date, and that perhaps I should update it.&nbsp; He’s absolutely right, and I apologize for a two-year omission, or whatever it was.&nbsp; This is the most recent information on Sasha:<br /><br />In November of 2010, Sasha had been, “… struggling for seven months with an ulcer on his left foot …” which was beginning to heal, and he was anticipating a skin graft within a few weeks, “… hoping to avoid amputation.”&nbsp; We had been taking him to a clinic which specialized in ulcers of this kind, mostly seen in diabetics (Sasha doesn’t have diabetes; he has peripheral neuropathy), and we had run up against a state of mind too often seen in the medical world, a sort of habit of thinking that goes (approximately) this way:&nbsp; ”Patient has foot ulcer; we have seen many millions of such foot ulcers, and we know what to expect of them.&nbsp; Patient’s family insists that the usual course of treatment is not necessarily right for this particular patient, and we are trying to make them realize that they are in a state of denial, and that we are simply trying to save them time and money when we argue for the outcome which we know to be right and inevitable, and which they, too, will come to accept as right and inevitable, hopefully without spending too much more time arguing with us.&nbsp; (The obvious, right and inevitable outcome was, of course, A.M.P.U.T.A.T.I.O.N.)<br /><br />When we found a new and creative Primary Care Physician, Paul Abramson, M.D., about this time, we learned — from him — that there was a group of physicians who regarded themselves as rescuers of limbs — particularly feet which had developed non-healing wounds — and when I wrote the note for the website, we were about to see Sasha’s left foot undergo a skin graft.&nbsp; The clinic had never suggested a skin graft.<br /><br />During the months that followed the graft, Sasha’s physical condition improved on all fronts.&nbsp; The graft took, and even the faintest hint of redness on any part of either foot was treated immediately.&nbsp; No new ulcers were allowed to develop.&nbsp; His diet was high in protein, and the two Tibetan women who took care of him cooked delicious and very healthy meals, particularly soups containing vegetables and chicken.&nbsp; They had learned cooking in India, where they had grown up, and they seemed to really enjoy creating meals out of whatever they found in the refrigerator, without having to consult any recipes.&nbsp; We saved enough money to buy the best food-processor on the market, and it was used every day to make smoothies out of fruits and nuts (more protein).&nbsp; Sasha has had no ulcers for over a year.&nbsp; He is rather frail, most particularly when walking, but his basic strength remains intact.&nbsp; His eyesight is very poor (macular degeneration), and we keep hoping that stem cell research will solve that problem while Sasha is alive and able to undergo whatever procedure might be available, since being able to see more clearly would be a wonderful gift to him.<br /><br />During all this time, another health problem was beginning to make itself apparent.&nbsp; Sasha was showing the early signs of dementia, mostly severe loss of short-term memory.&nbsp; Unlike the ulcers on the foot, dementia does not get better.&nbsp; One simply hopes that it will stop getting worse, or at least slow down the deterioration.&nbsp; So far, Sasha seems to have retained much of his chemistry memory, and also definitely has most of his word-games and pun-making ability intact.&nbsp; He is very good-natured, just as he’s always been, and loves being around people.&nbsp; When he isn’t sitting in the lab with Paul Daley (a few times a week), he’s down with one of his care-givers in the local Starbucks coffee shop, where a bunch of grey-haired people get together almost every day.&nbsp; He is, apparently, regarded as the group’s wizard/wise-man, probably because he says very little, but when he does open his mouth, the words that emerge are either quite wise, or very funny, and usually both.&nbsp; He enjoys his Starbucks hours almost as much as he does the lab hours.<br /><br />The medicine that has kept Sasha moderately affected by the dementia, and not seeming to worsen much is an old one, created by the great elder of the psychedelic world — Albert Hofmann — who called it hydergine.&nbsp; Here, in the U.S., it is called Ergoloid, and it’s very expensive.&nbsp; But it works.&nbsp; Unlike the standard dementia medications everyone uses — Aventia and Namenda — (have I got those right?), this ergoloid actually slows down the disintegration, and we are tremendously grateful for it.&nbsp; I wish more physicians knew about it and gave it to their patients.<br /><br />We have been supported in our effort to keep Sasha home, with home-care, by fund-raising every possible way, and by wonderful people who fund-raise for us, and so far we’ve managed to keep things going and the $360 a day bill for elder-care paid, because of thousands of good and wonderful people who have sent in small bills and big checks and everything in between, but finally, we’ve had to put several acres of gorgeous hillside on sale, and we’re hoping for the best.&nbsp; The economy is healing, so perhaps we’ll be successful, and then we won’t have to keep fund-raising all the time.&nbsp; Until that happens, we are grateful beyond telling for the support we’ve been getting from so many people all over the world!<br /><br />Blessings&nbsp; -&nbsp; Ann<br /><br />

				Does anybody know how to contact them?<br />I visited their website and cannot find contact information.<br />They should be advised to set up a Bitcoin address.<br />I am confident there are thousands of grateful psychonauts who are willing to help Alexander Shulgin at the end of his life.<br />This man is a hero and we must take care of him.<br />Pls PM me if you have contact information.<br />

I&#039;m personally trying to raise awareness on here &amp; in real life, I hope everyone does the same. <br /><br />Side note: about to partake in some 2cb. I last did MDMA too recently to use tonight as i like to only do it 3-5 times per year at most and always with 60 days minimum between use. So 2cb it shall be. I&#039;m going to try 40mg this time. 25 was awesome. 30 felt like 25 and in in mood to get weird &amp; watch Workaholics so I&#039;m going with 40mg. Gah the burn sucks though but cheers to the Shulgins and to all. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Big balls there for snorting 2cb. i once railed 10mg after coming back from a feer beers. felt like a pencil had been rammed up my nose. i then proceeded to pass out, smacking my head against the toilet, knocking myself unconcious. <br /><br />not fun. i&#039;d rather just bomb it. but i am teased and tempted from time to time with tiny tiny lines. adds a great edge to reality.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We tried bombing it found that it takes us 50mg orally but takes too long to work. Tried snorting and haven&#039;t looked back. It hurts like a mofo but only 2 mins of pain then within 15 minutes max effects, same peak overall and duration plus u only its only way quicker and u need 1/2 the dose as well. <br /><br />I found 40 to be very fun. 45 next time. I love how clear headed &amp; easy it is to handle while having amazing visuals

				To bump thread &amp; for those not wanting clearnet:<br /><br />To All Concerned,<br /><br />I am writing this letter in an attempt to inspire right action. As many of you may already know, Ann and Sasha Shulgin are currently suffering from financial distress largely due to Sasha’s increased medical expenses. This lamentable state of affairs is well within our collective powers to redress, and I feel that it is high time for the the psychedelic community to shower our heroic pioneers with a tangible demonstration of our everlasting gratitude.<br /><br />Everybody knows who the Shulgins are. It’s pretty much impossible to overstate their collective contribution to psychedelic culture, and indeed to the very fabric of human society at large. They not only brought us most of our favorite alphabetamines, they tested them on themselves and published their extensive notes so that the rest of us could benefit from their groundbreaking discoveries. Sasha is the greatest psychopharmacological chemist who ever lived. Ann is a pioneer in the field of empthogen-assisted therapy. Their love story has inspired millions of people. And that’s just for starters. Plus they’re also about the kindliest little old couple you’d ever be ridiculously honored to meet! On the few occasions when I’ve had the pleasure of visiting with the Shulgins, I have been deeply moved by the warm affection that flows so palpably between them, as well as by their consistently graceful interactions with awkwardly starstruck admirers like myself.<br /><br />So naturally I was quite shocked when I recently learned that they were genuinely struggling to make ends meet. I was so upset, in fact, that I asked a few close friends of the Shulgins why they didn’t have some kind of a donation link set up or something. Surely, I thought, if they were to appeal to the larger community…<br /><br />It turns out that they’ve been actively soliciting assistance for a while. But so far, the collective largesse of the millions of people who have personally benefited from the Shulgins’ invaluable research hasn’t actually added up to enough to keep pace with one old man’s medical bills and ongoing caretaking costs.<br /><br />I’m going to give the psychedelic community the benefit of the doubt here, and assume that the vast majority of the Shulgins’ innumerable beneficiaries are simply as ignorant about the true nature of the situation as I was. This is obviously at least part of the problem, and this letter is a quick first effort to shine a brighter spotlight upon the matter.<br /><br />However, my letter also endeavors to serve as a frank counterpoint to the immaculately tasteful cries for help that are currently to be found on the Shulgins’ websites. It seems that Ann and the rest of Team Shulgin are simply too reserved, humble, and self-effacing to say some of the things that really need to be said.<br /><br />The Teafaerie, however, suffers from no such conspicuous excess of good manners…<br /><br />Electrical engineer Nicola Tesla was one of the fathers of our time, yet he died in abject poverty. There’s no retirement plan for wizards, it seems; at least not for the kind who are focused on creating change rather than making money. I feel like I’m watching history repeat itself as I write this; except for this time it’s even worse, because there’s no easy scapegoat like Edison in the picture. Everybody knows about the staggering debt we owe to the Shulgins.<br /><br />I feel that failing to take action would reflect pretty poorly on us, actually. Worse yet, I fear that it would reflect poorly on the validity of the Work itself. I mean, if MDMA (for instance) genuinely helps to make us into better, more compassionate people, then how come we’re collectively failing to take care of even the most revered of our elders? Where is all the overwhelming love and the bottomless gratitude that psychedelic aficionados are always waxing so eloquent about?<br /><br />I personally have the Shulgins to thank for many of my most profound and life-changing experiences. Their discoveries and techniques have helped me to heal some of my deepest wounds. They’ve also opened me up to suppressed aspects of my true nature, allowed me to explore and integrate past traumas, catalysed positive transformations in my intimate relationships, showed me how to love myself, humbled me, and taught me how to dance. Nobody can put a price tag on those kinds of things, but I can assure you that no amount of money would persuade me to delete any of those experiences from my memory banks. To be perfectly honest, if it hadn’t been for the Shulgins I sincerely might have killed myself shortly after my best friend passed away a couple of years ago. So I guess that you could say that I owe them just about everything, when it comes right down to it.<br /><br />And I’m just one little person, right? I mean if the Shulgins literally had a dollar for every priceless epiphany that their work has ever helped to bring about, they would obviously be set for life many many many times over. Likewise, if they had a dime for every heart that has ever been opened. Or a nickel for every minor miracle of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual integration. And, of course, if they had even so much as a single penny for every ecstatically transcendent moment on the dancefloor… Well!<br /><br />Paying to see a psychologist for therapy these days usually costs over $100 per 45-minute “hour”. If you are one of the countless thousands of people who have benefited from embracing the DIY alternative to mainstream treatment that Ann and Sasha’s research has helped to facilitate, I encourage you to consider how much money you might have saved over the years. Couldn’t you afford to send the Shulgins a mere 1% of that savings?<br /><br />Plus I know that there are thousands of people out there who have made quite a tidy fortune for themselves in the underground market. Sasha totally could have made big money by creating patentable products for some gigantic pharmaceutical company, you know. But the Shulgins were committed to the open source ethic before it got trendy. Instead of cashing in on their enormously lucrative discoveries, they decided to make their data freely available for the sake of science and society, and at a not-inconsiderable risk to themselves. Wasn’t that ever so progressive of them? And wouldn’t it be aesthetically satisfying if everybody who later made heaps of money off of that data considered just tossing the original content creators a little tip?<br /><br />Ironically, dementia can present exactly like a challenging drug experience at times. And now that Sasha’s legendary mind has been unsettled by this all too common affliction, it feels to me like we’ve collectively been offered a rather poetic opportunity to return a gratuitous grace. MDMA has provided therapeutic benefits to millions of people, allowing them to pull themselves out of very difficult headspaces. And wouldn’t you feel just awesome if you could help to provide the person whose discoveries once brought you some much-needed comfort with quality palliative care and an around-the-clock tripsitter?<br /><br />There’s nothing wrong with enlightened self interest, and charity is the gift that gives back sevenfold. Big donations can get you invited to all the best parties, too! Imagine being introduced as the philanthropist who set the Shulgins up! Or maybe you’re a celebrity yourself, and you’re looking to donate to a cause that you know your fans will be especially proud to support. Social media would certainly be all atwitter about such a simultaneously edgy and genuinely heartwarming display of respect.<br /><br />I know that not everyone can afford to donate as much as they would like. (I can only spare $50 myself at the moment.) There are lots of other ways that you can help, though! How about setting up a “Support the Shulgins” table at your next event, party, conference, or festival? At the very least you can help to raise awareness by reposting this letter. Or, better yet, you could write to your friends and tell them how you feel about this important matter in your own words.<br /><br />We must not let History say that the psychedelic community stood idly by shaking its many heads and clucking its many tongues while Ann and Sasha Shulgin were reduced to poverty. And make no mistake! The eyes of the future are upon us. What we do (or do not do) now shall long be remembered, just as what happened to Nicola Tesla is remembered by us today. Because if there is going to be any kind of a human future at all, I strongly believe that the exploration of consciousness is going to end up being pretty central to its success.<br /><br />Let us act quickly, before we miss our chance to right our collective karma. Let us stand up and show our heroes that they are not forgotten. Think of it as giving them the standing ovation they so richly deserve. Think of it as giving them both a big hug and thanking them for the priceless gifts that they have bestowed upon you, and upon our entire species.<br /><br />This is something that we can accomplish, people. We can even do it fast, if we harness the power of our networks. It’s obviously the right thing to do. And now is the right time to do it. It is our great honor and privilege to be the ones who are in a position to help to give this truly epic love story a happy ending.<br /><br />Donations can be made via credit card or PayPal at: www.shulginresearch.org/home/donate/&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Cash, check, or money order can be sent to:<br /><br />Sasha Shulgin<br />c/o Transform Press<br />PO Box 13675<br />Berkeley, CA 94712

				Anton Köllisch (1888–1916) was the German chemist who, whilst working at Darmstadt for pharmaceutical giant Merck, first synthesized the chemical MDMA that would later come to be known as &quot;ecstasy&quot;.<br /><br />A patent was filed for the drug on Christmas Eve 1912, and was granted on May 16, 1914. Köllisch, however, died as a soldier in World War I in September 1916 with no idea of the impact his synthesis would have.<br /><br />From wikipedia<br /><br />Shulgin rediscovered MDMA in the scientific literature, and then helped mass popularise it :)

				I&#039;m pretty sure that guy invented MDA and then Shulgin added the extra M for MDMA.&nbsp; I may be wrong but I think that Wiki has it&#039;s facts messed up.&nbsp; Don&#039;t believe everything you read on the Internet!

				Will donate as soon as BTC address is confirmed.<br /><br />Also request for mods to sticky this thread, I think we all owe Sasha a few dollars.<br /><br />Perhaps DPR could set up a Silkroad donation fund for this cause to collect BTCs then donate them all anonymously to the foundation?

A holly jolly Christmas to all.<br /><br />After the Korean war the American military began research, including performing experiments on animals, on MDMA. This might have had something to do with Merck describing the drug as having a similar effect to adrenaline, or it might have been for interrogation purposes.<br /><br />In 1965 Shulgin was working for Dow, who allowed him to do research in a field of his choice. He chose psychoactive drugs. While studying phenethylamines he predicted MDMA would be a psychoactive drug. He didn&#039;t test it, but he did synthesise it.<br /><br />In 1967 a college student gave the good Dr his first dose of Molly. He fucking loved it.<br /><br />Sorry for the history lesson, but I do think this stuff is interesting, AB.<br /><br />
