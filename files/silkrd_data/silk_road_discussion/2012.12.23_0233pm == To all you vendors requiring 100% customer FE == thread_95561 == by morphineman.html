				?? months old and you require every order to fe, come on buddy, your feedback speaks for itself ?? transactions in ?? months? really,you don&#039;t use escrow for nothing? his goes against everything sr was built around. just because you are fast @ delivery doesn&#039;t mean they should pay out of escrow. maybe that is why you only have 19 transactions. you are shit lucky you got those. more and more vendors are coming on, not requiring fe you are going to loose all your customers if you continue on this path. i know how you feel it takes 1 scam and you change your whole business model. what is your reasoning behind fe you want your cash quick.,because the customer gets drugs quick?i had customers get their order 18 hrs after i accepted it, hen the finalize. escrow is for everyone protection. i know sr is not the best @ resolution&#039;s but im sure they are working on it, now that the vendors have a private section to tell others about scammers it helps weed them out. if i see a known scammers name pop up somewhere, ill take a min to tell that vendor to beware.but you have to get out of his 100% fe that&#039;s wrong, i can see a few selective fe. especially a Canadian customer getting it by regular mail. because we can not track i. like they can in the GREAT USA. so on those i require fe, as sr resolution will give customer refund if they say they did not get it, because you can not prove you sent it. i have been there, but i did not make every customer fe, some yes, .but if you are sending by express or priority, you have proof you sent it, so they have to pay.yes i have had customers float my funds the full amt of time. 19 days, but that is how its set up. if you have a customer who orders priority next day and they do not pay immediately , then get on them add them to beware of bad buyer list so on, but to blindly say everyone fe&#039;s THAT IS WRONG, AND YOUR BUSINESS WILL AND DOES REFLECT IT, MINIMAL SALES.<br />not only that buyers should BOYCOTT thoes businesses that blindly state everyone must FE.,again their is a time and place for fe,but that depends on a whole lot of factors. i have to admit i did increase my requirements for FE, BUT I WILL REEVALUATE TO LOWER TO A MIN NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

				Not that I support the argument either way but vendors over 95% feedback 300+ im happy to fe. Sometimes I think being a vendor on here seems sooo much hassle with all the risk and fees. Fuck the new sellers requiring fe but if supertrips, chemical brothers or xtcexpress etc want my fe immediately to make their lives a little easier. (Funnily enough none of the vendors I just mentioned require FE so maybe you have a point...)

				The point is that it protects both&nbsp; 8) Sellers who want to do real business&nbsp; know the rules before they buy an account , yeh they have to wait but it auto finalizes anyway &amp; if youve got loads of sales it shouldnt be a problem ( the business its mostly&nbsp; done it credit anyway ,well the REAL business/men do)<br />&nbsp;so if the buyer lets it auto finalize then dont sell him any again , other buyers can see he,s got a bad auto finalize rate and say no . simple , That why Im suspicious of&nbsp; F.E&nbsp; REAl seller have nothing to fear&nbsp; &amp; know it makes sense I always question why a seller wants to F.E Anyway either they dont understand the game or their selective scammers or just down right scamming thiefs... seen it too many times on sr .. imagine the sales they could get if they didnt want you to F.E&nbsp; business would increase 4 fold but hey thats just my opinion<br />Be careful with your money folks... theres that old saying a foul and his money are easily parted <br />have a good one all and take care&nbsp; ;)

Plus, if a very new vendor is insisting on FE I don&#039;t mind since I think that&#039;s just as good as giving us all a warning to stay clear of their scam.

				Most definitely scamming people if you require FE and haven&#039;t sold shit. Or my favorite. &quot;FE Because I feel like I can trust them&quot; Then a day later where you know they wouldnt have received a 70lb tv you read the best feedback and review ever. I actually attempted a purchase off an ex vendor that did that. I placed my order for a tv and it said in the ad may be required to FE depending on stats. Got a message asking for FE. I promptly responded back &quot;I spent 30k in 6 months if that&#039;s not good enough cancel my order.&quot; They placed it in transit and what do you know my TV never arrived and it took 3 weeks + to get my money out of escrow. Hopefully dirt bags like that stop buying vendor accounts and ruining it for all of us. Since I heard they went up to $500 I am hoping that&#039;s a deterrent for scammers. Established scammers have plenty of money to keep rolling there scams and no amount of money to purchase an account will make them stop.

				The terms for FE are defined in the marketplace guidelines...though I&#039;ll never FE until product is in hand and has been at least sampled and meets with the description of the listing I ordered.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad<br />
