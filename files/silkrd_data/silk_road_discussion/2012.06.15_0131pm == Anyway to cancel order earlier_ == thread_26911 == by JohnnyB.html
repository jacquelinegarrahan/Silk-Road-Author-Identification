				I made an order and it&#039;s in the processing stage. I&#039;m trying to get my order quickly but apparently the vendor I ordered from has been getting slow and unresponsive lately(MrYellow). On his page he says within the US the order will arrive within 3-5 days, but that&#039;s probably from whenever he gets around to shipping it and it&#039;s already been 2 days and we&#039;re still stuck in the processing stage without any communication.<br /><br />Is there anyway to cancel the order before 4 days? Contact the SR admins? This guy is wasting my time and he&#039;s got my bitcoins tied up so I can&#039;t make another order.

				In my experience he waited 4 days to process and was unresponsive. I was planning on canceling my order but he marked as in transit on a saturday (before cancel became an available option) when i ordered wednesday, (friday of the next week and I&#039;m still waiting.) Only then did he respond to my messages about processing time with &quot;Have you finalized yet?&quot;<br /><br />Glad i only ordered a small ammount to to test out Mryellow. This vendor appears to send packages whenever he feels like it, totally unprofessional vendor and a waste of time. Seems to be several others with the same problem.

				Oh great so he&#039;s pretty much trying to fuck with people......<br /><br />I only ordered a small amount I&#039;m not worried about the money, but what I am po&#039;d about is that my bitcoins are tied up in this bogus order.<br /><br />If I can convince him to cancel can the vendor cancel early?

				Yeah, vendors can cancel orders before it even shows up that you can cancel it yourself. Just try to explain to him you wanted your product up in transit and be already delivered in a timely manner. Be calm and polite as possible.

				Just wanted to update here that MrYellow did cancel my order when asked.<br /><br />I do think he is legit but reading his review thread and reviews I think he&#039;s gotten himself in over his head with too many orders. So speed is not his thing at the moment.
