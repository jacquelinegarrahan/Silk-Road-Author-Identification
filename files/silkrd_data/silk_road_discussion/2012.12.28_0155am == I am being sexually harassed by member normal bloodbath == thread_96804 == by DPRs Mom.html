				SR member &quot;normal bloodbath&quot; is sexually harassing me on the forums. He is flooding my inbox with vile and disgusting sexual messages. I cant imagine how many other innocent people just want to use the SR message boards but have to deal with sexual harassment from him too. Is there a way to ban him? How soon can he be banned?

				No wonder people think SR is a haven for pedos and rapists. You are all either indifferent or rallying around your pervert-king normal bloodbath. He needs to know that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated. He is a contributing factor to SR&#039;s negative reputation in the media.

				Just ignore but I would suggest still reading in the slight chance that there is something that might be helpful for you in the future. We are never too old to learn!
