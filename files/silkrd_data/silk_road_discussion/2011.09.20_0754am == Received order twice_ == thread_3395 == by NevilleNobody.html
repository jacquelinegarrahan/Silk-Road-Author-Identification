				I received a duplicate for and order I placed a month or so ago. I&#039;m pretty certain of the vendor as I recall the packaging and it&#039;s also not a regular product.<br />So, after enjoying some of it I&#039;ve PM&#039;d him to let him know and offered to sort him with BTC. He may say yay or nay but I won&#039;t need to help any old ladies cross the road for the next week as I&#039;ve earnt my karma. 8)

				I agree that it was nice of you to offer the vendor some BTC, my initial reaction to receiving an un-ordered package from a vendor I have dealt with before would be to shut down that address, and NEVER deal with that vendor again. If you get something you didn&#039;t order, it means that vendor is storing your address somewhere. Maybe encrypted, maybe not. If he gets busted and has your address stored unencrypted or stored at all for that matter, you are a a risk, although it is only a slight risk, but a risk none the less. So, while I applaud your honesty in wanting the vendor to get something for his product, you might wanna change up your shipping drop for the future

Instantly gave him BTC. This is excellent karma and should be be practiced by both sellers and buyers equally
