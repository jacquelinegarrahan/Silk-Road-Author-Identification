				Stop Online Piracy Act.<br /><br />Yes, it absolutely could effect TOR and The Silk Road, but maybe not directly. With each new law that gets passed which takes a small bit of freedom or liberty from the people, we get closer and closer to having our privacy completely taken away. It won&#039;t happen fast. There won&#039;t be just one law that comes out and fucks up the entire internet, it will happen slowly. First it starts with &quot;stopping terrorism&quot;, which there are already laws that have passed that makes internet and phone providers give any information that the police wants about a customer (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act.)&nbsp; Now they&#039;re stopping the filming of police, saying it breaks &quot;wiretapping laws.&quot; Then they start attacking piracy. What&#039;s after that? Probably something along the lines of &quot;Stop Internet Child Pornography Act&quot;, which would give good grounds to fuck TOR up. <br /><br />Then it just gets worse and worse, and we end up like North Korea, and the only websites we&#039;re allowed to visit is Government propaganda websites. It&#039;s called &quot;creeping normalcy.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeping_normalcy<br /><br />Enjoy Silk Road while it lasts. These times will be looked at one day with nostalgia, the good old days. It can&#039;t last forever, but it&#039;s making history.

				Stop Online Piracy Act.<br /><br />No, it would have no effect on bitcoin or SR, neither operate under ISP-controlled DNS servers that SOPA is proposing to censor.<br /><br />It might possibly affect main bitcoin exchanges if the government decides bitcoins are illegal, but bitcoin itself would be ridiculously hard to stop.
