				I just don&#039;t like the idea that if we didn&#039;t save the links or haven&#039;t interacted with a good vendor we now have no way to get to their listings. In turn isn&#039;t this going to force many people to have to buy from sketchy, new, unverified vendors??<br /><br />Also i still don&#039;t know how to find the good seller&#039;s listings any help would be great

				You have to look at it from both sides of the fence.&nbsp; As a new member of SR i totally sympathize with your point of view because I would love to buy Blue Dream from CNugs, but she won&#039;t because I&#039;m too new and she already has enough clients.&nbsp; So I am have to either go international or to try and find another domestic weed vendor with great ratings that sells ounces at good prices(which is few and far between).&nbsp; I was lucky enough to find that vendor though, so it isn&#039;t a huge deal any more (even though I still want some of that Blue Dream...).<br /><br />On the other hand you have to look at it from a smart dealer&#039;s perspective, which is the &quot;I need to cover my ass and not be too greedy&quot; mentality.&nbsp; If you already have enough loyal clients and busy enough filling those orders, then why risk taking on new people who could potentially be scammers or LEO?<br /><br />Who knows, maybe with enough good reputation as a buyer and an acting contributor on the forums some of the vendors you are hoping to get in contact with will let you use them.&nbsp; SR is like a microcosm of local and offline dealing.&nbsp; You can&#039;t just expect to jump head first into the game and start buying pounds of the finest weed without actually knowing people and having some kind of trust in the community.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				shit, looks like I didn&#039;t become a fan fast enough for some of the vendors moving to stealth mode. This is really depressing.<br /><br />Is there a way buyers can &quot;apply&quot; to become customers? I&#039;ve been a good customer but now I can&#039;t access vendors I&#039;ve even purchased from multiple times.

				if you have purchased from them you should be able to access their vendor profile through your feedback page<br /><br />still a bummer no way to get hooked up with new vendors you hadnt contacted who are now stealth.<br /><br />hopefully they will be considerate of newcomers occasionally and may have a weekend or few days every so often where they come out of stealth and accept PMs requesting new service or something. we can only hope<br /><br />i was looking forward to a ten strip from tony so stupidly didnt bookmark anyone else, but looks like I am out of luck sadly now all around.

				- sellers are trying to cut their loses, this works short term, and<br /><br />- at which point would you get to buy from this seller and how that works -no idea...<br /><br />

				I have been a member of SR for 8+ months, reading feedback and carefully selecting sellers and working my way up in quantities ordered, &quot;establishing trust&quot; as the community elders suggested. I had my weed sellers narrowed down to 3-4 whom I really liked. When the &quot;bookmark&quot; feature came out, I thought &quot;no big deal, I use my feedback links anyway to quickly find my favorites ...&quot; But the last few weeks I have noticed that some of these sellers never have any listings, yet still show lots of recent feedback. So I began thinking, &quot;what&#039;s going on here anyway? Am I banned or locked out from buying from these sellers for some reason?&quot; ... which is why I decided to search the forum for possible answers, bringing me to this post on &quot;stealth.&quot; <br /><br />When did this &quot;stealth&quot; mode thing begin and when was it announced to the SR community? Can someone tell me where the &quot;rules&quot; are posted so that an honest, reputable buyer like myself can make sure that I have access to good sellers? I thought that I was already playing by the rules, i.e. don&#039;t message sellers unnecessarily, finalize quickly upon receipt, provide fair and useful feedback, etc. <br /><br />Now all of a sudden, it seems as though SR is moving in the direction of &quot;dealers finding other (smaller) dealers to move their goods&quot; and to heck with everyone else ... I mean, I have purchased 4+ ounces in the last two months between 3 sellers ... How much does a buyer need to do to keep a few good sellers available? My stats for the 8 months I&#039;ve been here:<br /><br />Total transactions: 16<br />Total spent: $2016.61<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0.66%<br />Member for: 8 months<br /><br />My only Auto-finalize occurred when a 1 Gram order from Denmark never showed up and I gave it extra time due to the distance. I have also had multiple successful 1/2 oz or 1 oz &#039;out-of-escrow&#039; orders (per seller request, prior to SR policy prohibiting this) that aren&#039;t even listed in my stats.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong. I can understand a seller deciding that &quot;I have all that I can handle - no more buyers ...&quot; but it just seems a bit unfair (to buyers) when you play by the suggested rules, then you find out that you don&#039;t qualify because you yourself aren&#039;t a dealer and there are basically no guidelines by sellers saying how many purchases are too many to scare them off .... and how many are too few to get you removed from their preferred buyer list. <br /><br />So now the way SR seems to be moving is, any seller that has good quality stuff and decent service gathers up a list of preferred (large quantity) buyers, then becomes a ghost to everyone else ... and the remaining buyers are stuck with the lower quality, poorer service sellers. That seems to be a very &quot;seller centered&quot; community ... that will eventually discourage current buyers ... and future SR members.<br /><br />Is anyone else thinking about this?

				Buyers need to be able to exercise some *choice* too. Buyers feel that they&#039;re supporting sellers by buying their products. Who wants to buy from a seller for months, all along promoting his business via good feedback, only to learn one day that his seller has gone stealth and he wasn&#039;t selected as one of his preferred buyers?

				When a buyer goes stealth what happens?&nbsp; Do they simply not list anything or are their listings &quot;hidden&quot; from other users?&nbsp; Do they simply start using PM&#039;s and PGP?&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand what people are saying about &quot;bookmarking&quot; and using previous orders to get back to the seller.&nbsp; Can i get an explanation?<br /><br />I&#039;m only curious for future reference so i can make sure and bookmark the sellers i like so i don&#039;t lose them if they go stealth (if that&#039;s how it even works).<br /><br />Thanks!

				I think stealth is a fairly good idea, it protects SR as a whole, if a vendor has gone to stealth mode they probably wouldn&#039;t have accepted many new customers anyway.&nbsp; SR and DPR are protected by making it a bit harder to discern how big the entire SR network is.<br /><br />Some people are now considering becoming resellers, motivated partly by stealth but also as a way of providing international products to those that don&#039;t want to get sent packages from outside of their home countries.&nbsp; I think this would be a positive development.&nbsp; The market is evolving, stealth might be causing some headaches right now but it will eventually result in a better system for sellers, resellers and buyers alike.
