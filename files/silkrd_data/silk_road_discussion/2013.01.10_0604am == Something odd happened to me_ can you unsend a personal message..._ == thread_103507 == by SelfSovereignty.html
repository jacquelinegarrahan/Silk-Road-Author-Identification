				So I tried to view an interesting-looking thread, and it gave me a &quot;that topic is missing or you do not have permission to access it.&quot;&nbsp; Again and again it did this -- I assume the poster just deleted it, and being a regular SR user who wasn&#039;t really paying much attention I don&#039;t even remember what the thread subject was beyond being something that made me nervous for a moment.&nbsp; But then right after that, I got the notification of a new private message -- so I opened my messages... and there&#039;s no new messages.&nbsp; Plus the notification is gone now.<br /><br />I&#039;m used to looking past unreasonable paranoia and obviously this is most likely just some funky coincidence, but I&#039;m puzzled -- I didn&#039;t think it was even possible to unsend a private message?

As for the willfully lying, he has no qualms against my personal use of drugs or whatever, nor is he trying to scare me away from the site. He could have been misled somehow, entirely possible. The thought of lowly local LEOs hacking SR is scary though, however retarded the idea seems

				From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine): &quot;Although Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was only in combination with procedural flaws, operator mistakes, captured key tables and hardware, that Allied cryptanalysts were able to be so successful.&quot;<br /><br />The Enigma cipher is just a complex substitution cipher.&nbsp; Those are pretty weak.&nbsp; PGP is based on public key cryptography, which requires factoring enormous integers in order to recover the private key.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot harder to break than a substitution cipher.

				Your friend who works on police radios most probably seen a computer which was logged onto the silkroad or the forums.<br />Of coarse the police will have user accounts on silkroad and the forums for information gathering research purposes.

				August 11, 2011<br />Security Flaws in Encrypted Police Radios<br />http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/08/security_flaws.html<br /><br />&quot;Why (Special Agent) Johnny (Still) Can’t Encrypt: A Security Analysis of the APCO Project 25 Two-Way Radio System,&quot; by Sandy Clark, Travis Goodspeed, Perry Metzger, Zachary Wasserman, Kevin Xu, and Matt Blaze.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Abstract: APCO Project 25a (“P25”) is a suite of wireless communications protocols used in the US and elsewhere for public safety two-way (voice) radio systems. The protocols include security options in which voice and data traffic can be cryptographically protected from eavesdropping. This paper analyzes the security of P25 systems against both passive and active adversaries. We found a number of protocol, implementation, and user interface weaknesses that routinely leak information to a passive eavesdropper or that permit highly efficient and difficult to detect active attacks. We introduce new selective subframe jamming attacks against P25, in which an active attacker with very modest resources can prevent specific kinds of traffic (such as encrypted messages) from being received, while emitting only a small fraction of the aggregate power of the legitimate transmitter. We also found that even the passive attacks represent a serious practical threat. In a study we conducted over a two year period in several US metropolitan areas, we found that a significant fraction of the “encrypted” P25 tactical radio traffic sent by federal law enforcement surveillance operatives is actually sent in the clear, in spite of their users’ belief that they are encrypted, and often reveals such sensitive data as the such sensitive data as the names of informants in criminal investigations.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard Matt talk about this project several times. It&#039;s great work, and a fascinating insight into the usability problems of encryption in the real world.<br /><br />News article. http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/10/security-flaws-in-feds-radios-make-for-easy-eavesdropping/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;mod=<br /><br />The actual .pdf copy of the report ca be obtained at the folliwng clearnet link: http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/p25sec08102011.pdf<br /><br />After looking it over, all I can say is: &quot;What a clusterfuck!&quot;<br /><br />Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP-Key: 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22<br />Key fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7 3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />

This then gives them an idea of just how much work is required to factor prime numbers of a certain size. <br />The point is, it give you a benchmark -- it&#039;s like saying the distance to a certain destination is 1000 km.&nbsp; Walking will take you a certain amount of time; it will take less time with a car that can do 100 km/hr, and can be done in an hour with a jet that can do 1000 km/hr. <br /><br />No one knows what the capabilities of the government are, at least those who know aren&#039;t talking about it.&nbsp; Let&#039;s assume the NSA knows you&#039;ve bought a few pounds of weed last year... what do you think they&#039;re going to do with that information?&nbsp; Nothing, because sharing it risks compromising their collection methods, and the payoff isn&#039;t worth the risk. <br /><br />Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP-Key: 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22<br />Key fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7 3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
