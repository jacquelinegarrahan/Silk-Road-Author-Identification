				Hey all,<br /><br />Ok so ultimately this is totally my own fault as I was steaming drunk last night however....<br /><br />So I had some BTC exchanged in MT GOX last night as I was waiting around for the exchange price to drop. It did and I traded...DONE<br /><br />I then, as far as I can remember split up the different denominations of BTC and sent them across to multiple InstaWallets and then on to SR....FINE.<br /><br />So now the one InstaWallet address I did not copy paste has turned up in my SR account. Yet the InstaWallet address which I did copy paste and can track via block chain has not shown up. I have no clue where that BTC has gone.<br /><br />What it boils down to is how the hell do I tell from Block Chain where the fuck that BTC went?!! I can see it was confirmed etc but I have never been that great on the BlockChain interface and how it gets split up and what useful data I am actually seeing!<br /><br />In my drunken stupor I would have thought I sent it on directly from there to my SR account, the other one worked, so basically what I am asking is how I use the BlockChain info I have of that BTC address to chase down where the hell it went and how to get it back!<br /><br />Please if anyone has any insight into this or has been retarded enough to do their trading whilst drunk as I was please reply and help a fellow SR brethren out!<br /><br />Thanks!

				Hey canÂ´t help you with that other than suggest you look to seee if its still awaiting confirmation.. blockchain.info. <br />But I had a question, you said you were waiting for the price of BTC to dro&#039;p.. Have you seen some sort of pattern in the fluctuation of the price. Like is it cheaper at certain times / days? or were you just sitting around waiting that hopefully it would drop and it did

				Hmm no not really a pattern, but it just seemed to drop the later it got to the evening so I was up and still watching, then the whole big fuck up happened.<br /><br />I am lucky I didn&#039;t lose all my BTC that evening, but I am still no further with tracking it down.<br /><br />Has this seriously not happened to anyone else? BlockChain confuses me somewhat, I can see I released funds in 2 rounds from MT GOX. One amount to one InstaWallet, the other amount to another Wallet, I then sent the &quot;missing coins&quot; to the first wallet so everything was back together. again From that account I then sent on half to SR but the other half I have no idea where it went? It isn&#039;t still in that Wallet.<br /><br />I presume the green button in BlockChain is when it receives and the red is when it is all confirmed, but how they hell can I see where that other half of my sum total went?! I don&#039;t see any why I wouldn&#039;t have sent it ALL to SR. It is like Poirot trying to figure out what timings these transactions happened!<br /><br />Seriously any help appreciated on this as surely there must be a way to track them down from BlockChain?!<br /><br />Cheers

				This is the way I track my bitcoins going to the road. There may be better out there but this is what I do.<br />Go to blockchain.info and enter your SR BTC address into the search bar.<br />This should bring you to a overview of that BTC address showing the latest transactions going in and out of that address and hopefully you should see your recent sends in the list which should match up to what you have sent to your SR wallet. Once it shows 5-6 confirmations your coins should be on the road soon? (Not 100% on how many confirms SR needs)<br />If you can&#039;t find them using this try putting your sending wallet address into the blockchain.info search, this will then show you the addresses you have sent coins to recently, always double check the BTC addresses here because if your drunk and not copy pasting its really easy to mess up the send address. (Done that once before myself)<br />If you accidently sent the coins to a wrong address im pretty sure they are lost in the nether and can&#039;t be retrieved.

				thanks for the reply xdjx.<br /><br />Yeh I have pretty much done as you suggested but I still can&#039;t track it down.<br /><br />I sent the amount in 2 sections to two different wallets then combined them again, then from there I sent on half to SR and the other half I have no idea where it went. I mean the missing amount has over 400 confirmations so it is not like it hasn&#039;t reached it&#039;s destination, where ever that may be, but I can&#039;t see from BlockChain where it went. <br /><br />Am starting to think it is a lost cause and now wish I had almost done my InstaWallet&#039;ing outside of Tor as then at least I would have a record of the url. I mean I highly doubt I would have sent it on again from the Wallet I combined them in which is the strange thing, but as I say I struggle to read the BlockChain correctly.<br /><br />I know it is my own stupidity for doing in steaming but there must be a way to trace where it went.....?
