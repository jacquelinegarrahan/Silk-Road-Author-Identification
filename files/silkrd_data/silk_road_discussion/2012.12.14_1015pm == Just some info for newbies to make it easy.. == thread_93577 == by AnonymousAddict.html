				I didn&#039;t see where to do that in my account settings, but it&#039;s most likely because I am adjusting the settings from profile / account settings in the forums. Is this the correct spot. Thanks

				Thanks for the simple tips Anon... Trying to figure this bitcoin thing out has been a headache. Could you PM me a good bitcoin vendor to use to keep from getting scammed? I have still not made my first purchase yet. Also, what is PGP and how do I encrypt thing and keep my info safe. <br /><br />Sorry for the n00b questions, just gotta start somewhere and you seem willing to help.<br /><br />thanks a ton,<br />TCM
