				Today alotta people mostly newbies had they&#039;re funds redirected to other funds. That&#039;s why some have alotta coins, they&#039;re just covering tracks, your account would&#039;ve been emptied anyway. Drug hacks are actually perfect for those who do this shit so like last friday don&#039;t expect SR will be back until everyones wallet is restored. Any hackers feel free to give out some advice

				No, this is not an issue of hacking.&nbsp; DPR has already addressed it.&nbsp; It is a glitch and they are fixing it.&nbsp; The extra coins that were hitting people&#039;s wallets weren&#039;t real, so they weren&#039;t the product of &quot;redirected funds&quot;.

				The &quot;coins&quot; we saw moving around tonight weren&#039;t even showing up in blockchain ... they weren&#039;t real bitcoins.&nbsp; If someone were redirecting funds, then by definition the things moving around would be FUNDS - not fake glitch-coins.

				Hopefully those who sent real coins will have em directed back in2 they&#039;re wallets. Its not all fake coins that were redirected.

				Also, if someone wanted to use this to affect the market, they&#039;d do so with real btc ... not fake coins which were the product of a code glitch.

				How would glitch coins (non existent) affect the market. They theoretically would only exist within the database which DPR only has access to.&nbsp; How would this effect the market in the slightest?

				That&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to say - it won&#039;t affect the market at all because this is an issue internal to SR.

				Ok here is what I am wondering.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Say you pay a bill with money you don&#039;t actually have in your account.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When that transaction reached and was confirmed by say blockchain,&nbsp; would they not at that point be mixed into the market?&nbsp; &nbsp; Or at least affecting blockchain as well?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m just trying to wrap my head around it, and wondering how many people sent coins from sr wallets to other wallets?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />See what Im wondering?&nbsp; &nbsp;Couldn&#039;t someone stay ahead of the *fake* by pushing them around?

				People who attempted to send the non-existent coins to non-SR wallets couldn&#039;t - the transactions never showed on blockchain, so the issue was kept entirely within SR.&nbsp; No one was able to send any out.

				Oh okay.&nbsp; Stuff like this is way beyond my level of tech.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wonder if it is painful to have a brain so damn smart that you understand computer coding.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Or wait, maybe I am just really dumb? and most people can learn that stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Either way,&nbsp; &nbsp;I would try shaking the computer to fix most things.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				YES BS!!<br /><br />DPR&#039;s thread explaining it, is all you should be on. <br /><br />Starting threads like this, with Sensational Headlines like this, reveals your ignorance. <br /><br />It&#039;s like turning on a bright light outside in the summer, and watching all the moths fly into it and die.<br /><br />For those of you who think your brain might be better than that, here is the link to DPR&#039;s updates on the issue. <br /><br />Current fix time is approximately 3 hours. <br /><br />Link;<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120741.0
