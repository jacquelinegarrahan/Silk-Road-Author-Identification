				I appreciate the improvements, but I do wish there was some way to have a note if a seller is in bad repute, or you&#039;ve been notified of scams.&nbsp; There is a seller on there that seems to have conned more than one newbie into selling outside of escrow, and then rips them off.&nbsp; <br /><br />But in any case, thanks again for constantly improving around here.&nbsp; As always, I do wish there was a way to get newbies to forums so they could find out more about the sellers--and buyers--before they purchase...

				Very nice and needed update, but I also think we need some way of featuring newer and small time sellers. Otherwise we might end up with an oligopoly where its near impossible for smaller sellers to sell anything and reach the front page. Maybe we can have a category for this?

				MOST EXCELLENT!<br /><br />For the time that SR has been running &quot;live&quot; online, it has already evolved in an amazing fashion and at a breakneck pace.&nbsp; I actually find that very exciting. :D&nbsp; How cool to participate in the first sophisticated form factor for any future underground enterprise.&nbsp; Nifty.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />Possibly the math needs to be checked/tweaked, but this type of weighted averaging system will produce, over time, the best possible portrait of a &quot;lifetime&quot; positive feedback percentage for the sellers.&nbsp; And, it will doom someone like Barry Sneaky, whether he has 12 ratings or 500.<br /><br />Only one situation remains: Barry Sneaky and his ilk have to somehow be removed before they scam any more newbies.&nbsp; <br /><br />@HappyTree-no need to learn more now ma&#039;am.&nbsp; This just took care of any issues you were worried about.&nbsp; YAY!

You watch those points get taken from you.<br /><br />I have been reading some feedback from some sellers on SR. One of the comments were &#039;added a bit extra&#039; and the prick gave a 4 . 5 &gt;:(&nbsp; &nbsp;some people you just cant please so I suppose this new rating system will work better in the long run.<br /><br />SR is awesome imo.

				Wow.&nbsp; That guy did you dirty, dirty, dirty @ novocaine.&nbsp; He should be ashamed of himself.<br /><br />I think though that the sellers are maybe a bit *too* worried about trying to maintain a 100% perfect rating.<br /><br />In fact, as time goes on (say in 6 months) it would seem to me that anything over 90% for a seller of normal items and anything over 80% for a seller of hard to get/prone to buyer abuse items (like H, crack, coke, meth) would be an oustanding feedback number and get you plenty of business.<br /><br />Maybe it would be good to start putting in the minds of the buyers a direct comparison of feedback scores to scores on a test?<br />Using the more liberal scale:&nbsp; 90+ is an A, 80+ is a B, etc.&nbsp; That&#039;s a concept of grading that everyone knows ever since grade school. <br />And no amount of being wonderful is going to cause every person out there to give you a perfect score.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong, you should be all about customer service.&nbsp; Prices here reflect the buyer protections they receive and part of that (even though it&#039;s not strictly a &quot;protection&quot;) is the great customer service.<br /><br />If I was a seller I just wouldn&#039;t want to be checking my feedback score, nervously, like a guy does when he day trades stocks.&nbsp; It&#039;s just another way that doing this biz can eat up all the other good things that are in your life.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have fun, enjoy your life and selling on SR as part of that life and don&#039;t let the people who treat you badly without cause get you down.<br />Just think: because it&#039;s online, you never have to meet them.&nbsp; That&#039;s a big plus; don&#039;tcha think?&nbsp; :D

				the nice thing about this system,it doesnt just say 95%,80%,100% etc etc...it gives the number of transactions,that is very important,i would lean way more towards someone with 95% with 200 sales that someone with 100% and 10 sales....i reckon though,that with this new system,when a buyer sees less than 100% they believe that the seller received a 1/5 at some time...when in fact it was more like a few 4/5,which is fantastic.i think it should emphasize the lowest score and highest score in that new area and then the user will be able to click the numbers to view the feedback..i dunno...

				@swan the % rating doesn&#039;t change : it is still (total points received) / (total possible points) This only counts actual ratings, you can have transactions without any rating but this will not change your % number.<br /><br />I like the rating system AND the percentage number. The numbers help new sellers (although they get faked too much) and rating shows constancy. <br /><br />4/5 is not fantastic, ever. 4/5 = 80% = acceptable but not awesome. 80% should be reserved for some minor seller screw up that was still acceptable. This business has a very low tolerance for mistakes and any 4/5 should be taken pretty seriously. A serious seller will make some 4/5 mistakes but they should be very rare.<br /><br />Any mistake that involves safety or privacy should be judged much harder.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am wary of rating trolls.

				@smokeourbowls this system is awesome. Look at all the top rated sellers. 100s of feedback and only a couple of 4/5s&nbsp; at the most. This is exactly who buyers WANT to buy from.<br /><br />Experienced buyers DO get more pull, the theory being that they actually know what they are talking about. That is the #1 criteria. It is only later, if they rate the same person over and over that the effect starts to go down. Getting 5 reviews from one friend is less important than 5 reviews from 5 different buyers. <br /><br />

				I agree that the new feedback system is awesome and a great improvement over the old one.<br /><br />But I would agree with @smokeourbowls that it would be nice to see how the system works.<br /><br />Or is this something that needs to stay private so some of the more skilled of our sellers work the system to geek it for their own benefit?<br /><br />I just like transparency, when it is appropriate.<br /><br />So I would love for SR to weigh in and either tell us it needs to stay private OR show how the system weights the feedback.<br /><br />This has been a regularly scheduled polite request for more information.&nbsp; bye!&nbsp; :)

				we can definitely share the detail, though it gets a bit technical, and we are tuning some the parameters, so the whole thing isn&#039;t set in stone.<br /><br />basically, each feedback score is weighted by three factors: buyer activity, age, and purchase price.<br /><br />The buyer activity weight is determined by finding the average and standard deviation of the log of the number of vendors reviewed by buyers who&#039;ve ever left a review.&nbsp; if the log of the number of vendors reviewed by the buyer who left the feedback is greater than the average, the review has a &quot;buyer activity&quot; weight of the number of standard deviations above the average plus one.&nbsp; If it is below average, then the weight is the inverse of the number of standard deviations below the average minus one.<br /><br />The age weigh is found by raising 1.02337 to the power of the review&#039;s age in days and then inverting it.&nbsp; We got 1.02337 by making a review half as valuable after one month as one that&#039;s just been posted.<br /><br />The price weight comes from the following formula: 0.2*log(0.02*($price)+1)+1 where $price is in dollars.<br /><br />You then multiply the weights together to get the total weight for that review.&nbsp; Add up all of the weighted reviews and divide by the total weight to get the weighted average, then do 25*(1-avg) to get &quot;percent positive reviews&quot; metric.<br /><br />To get the seller rank, we find the averages and standard deviations of the &quot;percent positive feedback&quot; and the log of the total weight of the reviews for all active sellers. We then average the number of standard deviations a seller has above or below the average with a 4 to 1 weight on their average feedback over their total weight.&nbsp; This is a seller&#039;s rating, and we rank everyone according to this rating.<br /><br />There are a few little details left out for brevity, but that&#039;s basically it.<br /><br />

				(A shameless plug for my self-serving interests:)<br /><br />I&#039;d like to see a variable number tempered by a coefficient of determination of a sample of recent reviews matched against a the forecast of a trendline of past reviews used as the base of the power function determining the aging weight; a general change in quality could increase the base and make past reviews have less weight and minimal change in quality could allow past reviews to hold higher weight. It just seems like a nice stability buffer for generally-consistent vendors (plus, I don&#039;t see why past reviews should lose half of their value every month if the vendor&#039;s staying consistent).

Vendors who come and go quickly aren&#039;t penalised for doing so (but their transactions hold--appropriately--high weight compared to transactions of a vendor who has made more transactions in the past and has stayed consistent into the present) and vendors who have been around a long time aren&#039;t penalised for that either (which I am admittedly extra-vehement about, sort of falling in that boat--though I don&#039;t suppose I&#039;d have a different opinion in any other case) because notable change (positive or negative) in a vendor&#039;s reviews would place more weight on recent reviews (preventing senior vendors from resting on their laurels but keeping the significance of past reviews in cases where there isn&#039;t any reason to exclude it). It&#039;s not a penalty for vendors who aren&#039;t long-term, consistent investors; it&#039;s a mechanism to avoid placing undue weight on aberrant data points due to their recency (for everybody).<br /><br />As it is, I could start a new vendor account, make 3 transactions, and be ranked like fifty places higher than I am right now... but that seems dishonest.

				So...<br /><br />Does this mean a small-scale seller with a previously stellar track record can get one bad review from a flakey buyer and have their rating totally fucked because the new feedbacks carry more weight and they don&#039;t have as many feedbacks as a large seller?<br /><br />Or am I misunderstanding something here.&nbsp; Because I&#039;m not really digging the sound of that.

				to put it into perspective I have 16 transactions with only 1 4/5 rating in my second last feedback. I dropped from 100% to 98.7%. 4/ 5 is still great...but to me, I failed.&nbsp; <br /><br />So really the rating is only there to make the sellers not sleep at night.... worrying about their scores ::)<br /><br />Its the feedback that will get you buyers not the rating. If you suck as a seller it will show in your feedback. A decent buyers will judge you by your feedback not your rating. <br /><br />Even if you get the occasional feedback troll you will still be miles ahead if your a decent seller because peeps want their shit again and again and they are going to kiss your ass if the product and service is good :D

Having suggested a quick and intuitive fix for misrepresenting people&#039;s feedback in terms of statistical anomalies, I&#039;m rather appalled that my suggestion has been waved off in favour of preserving some integrity of the system whose existence balances precariously on a logical faux pas concerning the possible volatility of the quality of vendors (which is addressed and amended in my suggestion, no less) and I am further concerned that you&#039;ve acknowledged my grievance--and are hence aware that the system does not always adequately represent a vendor&#039;s feedback--and that you are actively campaigning against implementing changes to the new system in spite of that. While I wholeheartedly appreciate the service that Silk Road provides in the world, I am slightly disappointed at the moment.

				There will be always fake feedbacks just to make better rating. the same person make 2 different account and make rating for himself. that&#039;s so all over Internet. the best is that people try product and decide is it good or not, and there should be only rating in the sense of: scam or not. in other case, there will be &quot;feedback war&quot; between competitions. I think website should be neutral but it is not if they gave possibility for war. where is money, there is war. <br />I remember when I sold weed before 6 years (in that time the price was just 1 eur per gram, I brought 4 grams), 2 people pretended they want to buy it, just to get chance in front of other people to say how it is shit small package, etc, but they did so just because they sell weed too. For me it was comic because it was city with 1,5 million people and there is enough place for everybody. but some people are small in their mind and that&#039;s so. <br />and in this site are not 1,5 m people, so, war possibility should be disabled, as I said, it is enough to know if it is scam or not, the rest people must check personally, they can order 1gram, before they order more.

				Sorry, but until there&#039;s a way to deal with fake feedback the new rating system can&#039;t be much better than the old system.&nbsp; There are some sellers who have exactly the same wonderful comment in two different feedback entries.&nbsp; What a strange coincidence!&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; &nbsp;And if you look over the very similar writing style and choice of words in some comments, you get a strong feeling that the same person left two (or sometimes more) feedback entries. <br /><br />This wouldn&#039;t bother me so much except that that all feedback, truthful or not, apparently will be taken into account if a transaction goes to arbitration.&nbsp; When I see that a buyer only got some of his Bitcoins back from an order that never arrived, and the seller has a lot of obviously fake feedback, that just makes me question the escrow/arbitration process of Silk Road.

				I have that sometimes, two similar feedbacks, but that&#039;s because for my US customers I charge a shipping addon - it&#039;s a lot easier for me to manage my inventory than creating two entire sets of listings at two different price levels and having to adjust the damned inventory every depending on who happens to order to Canada and who happens to the US.<br /><br />The feedback ratings are only half the story - they are quite limited.&nbsp; If you want the real juice go to the rumor mill.<br /><br />And no there is no way to see what users leave feedback, since you can link through to the item being reviewed.&nbsp; This was one of the big no-no&#039;s pointed out when modifications to the feedback system were being discussed - we need as much transparency as possible without divulging too much and threatening buyer&#039;s privacy.&nbsp; The solution right now I think is best (and also happens to be the one I suggested :)&nbsp; )

				I think that the feedback system has some flaws:<br /><br /><br />1) It&#039;s bad statistically-wise: 90% of the seller are in the (90-100) range, while (0-90) is almost empty.<br /><br />2) Due to point one, it is very difficult to distinguish between sellers rank-wise<br /><br />3) Moreover, a (98) seller can be much more trustworthy than a (100) seller.<br /><br /><br />I would change it following the ebay way:<br /><br />1) A score based on # of sales, eventually weighted over time (Old transactions eventually fade out<br />- or -<br />A score based on internal SilkRoad metric, with no upper limit.<br /><br />2) A score based on&nbsp; customer&#039;s satisfaction.<br /><br /><br />People inside Ebay worked a lot on finding a system which is scam-proof (as much as a feedback system can be) and intuitive (rich in informations).<br /><br />No need to reinvent the wheel IMHO...

				SR&#039;s feedback system is already front-weighted, albeit on a longer time-scale.<br /><br />Just looking at the number beside a seller&#039;s name isn&#039;t enough.&nbsp; Checking their profile page (get a feel for them by what they say), reading through feedback, even the fact that each product has its own feedback is handy to a buyer.<br /><br />The real value is in the forums though.&nbsp; That is where you get a lot closer to real time, with praise, issues, resolves, etc. being posted up.<br /><br />I think for the next feeback edit out, breaking feedback into three separate categories would be more ideal:&nbsp; customer service, shipiping/packaging, product quality.&nbsp; Each one would have a score out of 5, and be weighted equally (i.e. 33%) when considering their contribution to a seller&#039;s rank, and would give buyers a clearer picture in an instant.&nbsp; But feedback commentary should also be thorough on the buyer side, as opposed to just &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;great&quot; or &quot;Decent&quot;.&nbsp; Take ten seconds and explain what made you come to that conclusion.<br /><br />We made a step in the right direction, though, and SR&#039;s improvement will always be a series of small steps in the right direction.

				The real problem as stated earlier is the possibility of sellers setting up buyer accounts just to boost their ratings if a seller is rated 86% and they have left half the feedback themselves. They look like they are average when they may have scammed 3/4 of their customer.<br />The other thing is that if feedback looses half it&#039;s value every month and the buyer has finalized early and left positive feedback, waits 2-3 weeks for package to arrive before changing feedback 1-2 later that feedback is half as effective. Not to mention ratings can take 7 days to adjust. Meaning a smart scammer will ask people to wait a bit longer for their package while adding there own positive feedback.<br /><br />Any seller under 95% is a possible scammer/ selective scammer.<br /><br />We should not put up with scammers. <br /><br />I would suggest more buyer fees to help protect up from buyers been able to do this. Maybe this extra revenue could fund more buyer / seller protection I think this thing would become more popular if it were designed to protect people even better.
