				I&#039;d be interested to hear other opinions, it&#039;s certainly a good way to get customers to leave 5/5 feedback on every purchase, then the vendor can change listings and is able to abuse the system and scam customers. The lottery itself could also be a scam, who can prove or in fact disprove if a &quot;draw&quot; of some kind has actually happened.

				Most lotto&#039;s are based on the transaction # so it&#039;s impossible to scam, I personally never do the &quot;draw&quot; lotteries!<br /><br />I like to know if I have won right away!

				I agree with white out, lottos based on transaction numbers are better, like for example, you win if the last character is a &quot;7&quot;.

				I&#039;ve played Optiman&#039;s lottery a few times and won over double what I&#039;ve spent! Great for fun with leftover BTCs, as was earlier said no way to scam using the transaction ID#. <br /><br />One thing I am a little puzzled about it the &quot;1 in 16 chance to win 2BTC instantly&quot; listing by SR Gaming Commission. Since the lucky number is 7 and the numbers only run 1-10, isn&#039;t that a 1 in 10 chance to win? Idk, maybe I&#039;m just a little high.&nbsp; 8)

				Put to one side, for a moment, the part of my question solely about the lottery itself, but what about the fact that vendors can charge pittance for you to enter and you have to leave 5/5 to qualify for the lottery, then the vendor could switch his listings to then say 10g of 85% pure Cocaine&nbsp; 3BTC. Everyone checks the vendors feedback, sees rows upon rows of&nbsp; 5/5 feedback. Vendor then says everyone has to FE, and potentially takes thousands of BTC, it&#039;s not the lottery itself, which the main question of my thread was about, it&#039;s using those stats to build a fake reputation. I think it&#039;s entirely possible.

				I love hexadecimal. Its used by computers as it can be converted to / from binary very simply. A long binary number can be split into groups of four digits; and in binary the numbers 0-15 can be represented by four digits. So each group can be converted to its corresponding hex number:<br /><br />1101 1011 0111 1001 0001 1111<br /><br />1D&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;07&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;09&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1F<br /><br />(I studied computers at school; before the internet was widely available, its never done me much good and I&#039;ve fallen far behind current developments, but this is one elegant fact I remember!)<br /><br />There is a remnant of base 12 in our counting system: the fact we have words for eleven and twelve, and twelve inches in a foot. You can count to twelve on one hand by counting finger sections with your thumb. Twelve is more useful for simple calculations than ten, it is divisible by 2,3,4 and 6. Ten is only divisible by 2 and 5. So you can halve quarter third and sixth numbers based on twelve.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apparently part of the reason Koreans exceed westerners at learning maths is their counting words . Their word for eleven is &quot;ten one&quot; for twenty five &quot;two tens five&quot; and fifty three &quot;five tens three&quot; (all in Korean obviously!)<br />This means that Korean children have a much easier time learning to add as sums like &quot;twelve plus forty seven&quot; are to them &quot;ten two plus four tens seven&quot;<br /><br />Anyway.....there you go.

				Thinking about it lotteries are a way for everyone to get their stats up, buyers and vendors.<br /><br />If your worried about them changing their listings and scamming people then I would suggest always checking the item link next to feedback.&nbsp; A vendor may have many products in stock and just because I see great feedback everywhere it may not be for the product I want so I make sure to find good feedback for what I&#039;m looking for. <br /><br />I have seen a vendor that had a listing just for feedback, literally a listing for $0 with a title of something like &quot;For feedback only&quot;&nbsp; Is that even allowed?&nbsp; There was only 1 person that used it and left feedback but the whole thing seemed off to me.

It is there purely for this reason only. Once I&#039;ve seen buyer stats, the order gets cancelled and the 1 cent gets refunded. No feedback is given.

				Very good of you to help your customers who FE&#039;d. I hope if I ever have an order that doesn&#039;t arrive, I have support from a vendor. I choose to avoid vendors who require FE.

I&#039;m from Australia thought bad I only ship domestic. So there is no customs for the orders I send, which is why I find it very difficult to believe people when it &quot;doesn&#039;t arrive.&quot; Currently got 1 customer who FE&#039;d and said it never showed up and wants a reship, but it&#039;s hard to decide if they are a scammer or not. They have good buyer stats, but I thin&nbsp; they have done this to other people and gotten refunds send directly to them, not through escrow so it doesn&#039;t affect t heir buyer stats.<br /><br />I am a buyer on the site too, so I know what it is like for buyers, but buyers don&#039;t know what it is like to be a vendor and have so many scam attempts.<br />I try to be fair.
