				Don&#039;t have an opinion on whether it has changed ownership or not, but I do know that the recent email to Crazy Eights from &quot;DPR&quot; (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181513.msg1321080#msg1321080) does not read like the DPR I am familiar with...<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

				When I first heard this sort of &quot;feeling&quot; around I discarded it as the usual paranoia or either personal dislike for a certain individual (I think most can understand to whom I&#039;m referring to), but I must admit that I&#039;m now starting myself to having doubts about this. I&#039;m still uncertain on the reality so I am just keeping by myself in silence watching things unfold, but some recent moves are not so encouraging, I must admit.<br /><br />I could either understand DPR as being an office or title and not necessarily an unique individual (also if interpretation from a movie is not exactly what I would call a proof) but still depending on who is at the lead things can change, and sometimes they can change... dramatically.<br /><br />Let&#039;s just hope this is not the case and this is just an usual case of psychotic thought/facts connections (too much use of DMT can tend to develop that ;) )

				If some of you recall, this happened about a year ago.&nbsp; DPR&#039;s writing style changed and some changes were made to the site.&nbsp; Also the old forum mods were replaced.&nbsp; To me it was sudden, but it has worked so far.

				SR is worth a lot. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it&#039;s changed hands at least once in the last two years, but that&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing. As long as they continue to operate it well. I do think people put wayyyy too much trust in DPR/SR in general though. All this shit is underground so anything&#039;s possible.

I&#039;m pretty sure lots of &quot;groups&quot; would be willing to invest the bling-bling to get the codes &amp; other things...<br /><br />The question about &quot;why selling&quot; has (probably) a quite easy answer: to get of the stress... If you can sell an anonymous website, while being anonymous, to another anonymous buyer - then you&#039;re pretty sure you&#039;ll not get caught anymore (1 condition: untraceability of your BTC&#039;s!). <br />I can imagine that someone who&#039;s lived with the stress of being DPR for a while would like to get rid of that constant pressure on the nervous system... Yes, he&#039;s probably made lots of money since he created the site, but is money everything? No, I&#039;m quite sure that being able to spend the money without looking over your shoulder every second is worth more than the money you can earn... <br />And, no matter how cool and tough you are - I don&#039;t think it&#039;s easy to live with that pressure... <br /><br />So, when you write: &quot;No one does this stuff and hands it over for a quick profit.&quot;, I do agree, but I don&#039;t think something like SR would be sold for a quick profit... it would rather be sold so that the seller could spend a life-time of easy-going without anyone knowing who he is (and in the meanwhile building up something &quot;legit&quot; with the money he/she/they earned...

				I would be more inclined to believe that another administrator like Inigo would take the helm as the original DPR went off with his riches and it continued in a cycle much like in The Princess Bride and not that it would actually be sold.<br /><br />That&#039;s my two satoshis.

				The Pirate Bay has been sold at least once for a significant amount of money, so i don&#039;t know why it couldn&#039;t happen here. A few other trackers I use have also seen changes in &quot;management&quot;. Just how this kind of thing works. Some people make their money and get tired of the risk, some go to jail, some just disappear never to be heard from again (or reincarnated under a new alias at least). <br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s paranoid of people to keep an eye on it either. A change in management can just as easily be the feds catching an admin and getting into their account. You need to stay vigilant.

				I tend to agree with Jack - changing the roles so someone else can step up for their turn as DPR is what the idea is all about. The current DPR plays the role so long as needed, then moves on, possibly for good or to a mod&#039;s role while DPR mans the helm.&nbsp; Wesley was the 4th DPR in The Princess Bride, the previous 3 having retired with their riches...

I would imagine, after reading this thread, DPR has to close his eyes and focus on his breathing to keep from getting extremely upset. People are accustomed to DPR posting in a well-worded, ultra-professional way; and when he tries to interact like a person; people say it&#039;s not him (another reason why this hasn&#039;t been addressed). To be honest, DPR has addressed this issue by saying people are slinging accusations and saying messed up things. He clearly has a problem with it, but the people who know that apparently don&#039;t give a fuck.

				To become paranoid or speculate about DPR not being DPR when one never ever even knew who, whom, or what DPR is or was from the get go...<br /><br />...is absurdity at its best. <br /><br />The Silk Road could be a number of things started by persons truly unknown. We have no proof of anything nor are we able to test anything other than that vendors are able to sell to patrons and patrons are able to buy from vendors. And whatever the Silk Road actually is, that is what matters most currently.

It has been proven time and time again that whenever a single person/entity becomes to large for the powers that be they want their share.

				hmm this is ineresting, never thought about that. I always assumed DPR was always the same person, and always would be. I am starting to get the same uneasy feeling you guys are. I hope it is just paranoia. I would hope that if the original DPR were to pass the helm, he would be wise enough to pick a successor just as passionate to the cause as he is

				From what we&#039;ve come to understand.. the &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; Title.. is passed on after one runs the role for a certain amount of time.. then a &quot;predecessor&quot; is there and has been training.. and then boom, becomes the new &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; without telling anyone... or at least I think that is how it went.. It was something similar to this, haha.<br />So, for people &quot;speculating&quot; the &quot;change of Leadership&quot;.. it has probably happened once.. if not twice or three times... maybe even four times.. since this has been running.<br />The DPR now definitely has a different &quot;hand&quot; to him so to say.. and we remember when DPR came out and posted in the forums about how he &quot;was changing his writing style to better throw off LE&quot; or something along those lines. <br /><br />Perfect example of when the &quot;reins&quot; might have changed. So much shit is going on behind closed doors.. we&#039;ll never know, remember? We&#039;re just here for the ride. <br /><br /><br />

				Many people think the DPR changes after a certain amount of time. SR has only been around for a little over two year which isn&#039;t much time. Plus, I bet it takes several months just to get the hang of things. This does not seem like the most practical way to do it.<br /><br />WHAT I THINK is that the DPR changes after a certain amount of money made. Because of his anarchistic/libertarian views, I think it&#039;s safe to assume he knows all kinds of people can be corrupt. A new DPR could hike up commission % and let it ride. But because the DPR would still be ousted when the limit is reached, there&#039;s no reason to. Also, having it based on amount of money made creates unpredictability. Why would DPR want us and LE to know when he is going to retire and have a new person come in? Finally, I think DPR would want to quit while ahead. Having a set amount of money to reach would keep him from getting carried away while still having a good amount of money in his pocket. This would give him a chance to relax more (but maybe not entirely because he could still be a target for LE.) Note that this idea does not rule out the chance of DPR being a group of people.

If there was a real way to setup the business and keep it&#039;s morals this would be it.<br />The current SR pays lip service to it&#039;s roots IMO in the same way&nbsp; Ben n Jerrys do

				I think it&#039;s the same person who used to go by the handle Silk Road.<br />Changing writing styles is part of the game.<br />DPR/SR has been giving interviews since the beginning.<br />There is literally no evidence as to who, how many there are or where DPR is, so we are all speculating.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at all if this place wasn&#039;t run by one person, or even a small group, but a large, well-funded criminal organization.<br />You just never know.
