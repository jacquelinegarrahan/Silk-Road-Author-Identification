				Hi everyone!<br /><br />Surprise, I am a newbie.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; And have a couple questions.&nbsp; I have been around SR for a couple of weeks and have read everything I can up to this point and have not been able to find what I am looking for.&nbsp; I would like to place an order.&nbsp; I am wondering first of all if it would be a good thing to place an order or two of inexpensive digital products (or is there something else better?)&nbsp; before I order anything too risky, in order to do some trust building.&nbsp; Or will that make any kind of a difference to a vendor (in trusting me) or not?&nbsp; It has been such a tedious process to get bitcoins here, I don&#039;t want to waste them if it won&#039;t make a difference.&nbsp; Hope that makes sense.<br /><br />I was also wondering if anyone happens to have time on their hands to let me message them and make sure I have this encryption thing down.&nbsp; If you do, I&#039;d be so grateful.&nbsp; Here is my public key, just in case - and thanks!<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBE6mzhYBCAClf3xJBybQSaOfKudiAOcH68/OIx9M5OzZ5QMNeEQ/oLmOHOdu<br />5RaPyVZwIrzIDqQl59DxE7Tr2bicRJ+SMQf5HYAW3Wk/aQVZmVFm/GTXjKzxyQ0W<br />NAPISg40FkGqcm5rIxZJ9w7HnAr4MWsigIuOUjBSe8BeVBIdNGKxWaOxatg5BsRf<br />9lfhVe8eCU33cbr70zFTGbAnSjXmJlJ/SKEKydG2vz0X8aR/g7Ij4MJSY840k56D<br />+uo88tciAPpl3xJcHLb2x/FSNCYLoBIOt4Yaos7PjOvb7rpf6RnKwcHfQblD7E/r<br />QbguB7oALLG0iUj5A9R1mjrwai53XMF2z/yvABEBAAG0H0Rvbm5hIEhlbnNsZXkg<br />PGxycDcyQHlhaG9vLmNvbT6JATgEEwECACIFAk6mzhYCGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkK<br />CwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJEJlcg340smJP0xYIAI7bdGRenXvJxom4ACrE4Vmr2aZe<br />cN8qq6qX0nio+a+GhSgHInUH5gEhYZPrNL8zEB8VcJzUeZ0Asnp+xY9mx9a5hbo9<br />GSAG0gA3Ifav4oeEqNNm9y7t1JosVyTki4lp3HFidm9Ih5rOmZBQfyBgvDmUzHB6<br />Hog/Ru1gih5RlBC640cwEWNv/eb8YotsDsY3zuD0pDsdnF7ruXAgCbx5cmVy7Ej1<br />RC020zwYGV4R3slKvljRlSBKGPW33E39f5MCxS1s306uGY/5TTGf8W00eTGHNC2q<br />WoRNJ0MtwZCU+3bEwu5PPmWsU3vuM5ONEKGtXw6uQieVi9wF44uYfF3E0/S5AQ0E<br />TqbOFgEIAKqvXnniLvEuJVVgcgPdmwxhuwttm91cqfx7B/snMPr4eiIk5t8JIdMC<br />J+U8/gHolzCMdXye/pc3WNjORVFUKzgFnirGLCEts/Db64yBcZvqnA4+Y9JpsXrV<br />e+Uqig4hdlRAjJouKYPqPyqF3NBM1NTYszvPRujMcaXf/pWRVzlMu1HUpGjJC6VV<br />WPAzeIp2R6vBdLBjdIeaWytc7zsb65iNylb9E93gzux/1uKi+lXJ7b+69Npd6Bwe<br />utA8DZkPua+el5QA5Ph4xadUqRyqprE7R02JfPpxmY1ltHB8ht1PkDOwhf9rmvyy<br />1fchCStL1k08Fdq5AIiDmsJrxltCMwEAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQIACQUCTqbOFgIbDAAK<br />CRCZXIN+NLJiT8jhB/9ghWsHrrog3KaucPW/KfvU0Zfh5w11f0QcrqlNEq6k+2hj<br />irNktooGuvKuoujKXL9xn/Ue8Deswukk1cMfsRf5NPNvK9Pv9o8GiV9xHBm8+mBL<br />CME+LuSTEuJA0JXvwQbMZuvWlgl31Hz6oGwadK8Invjg+jvoJgdfngkB2uzyKBPF<br />tnZbwENxfL0ZRTRTfjIy1lsLb2UjwgrXbw/FiNR3893PlEWy0Nc9HkIKAs/L0Xcz<br />uu5hXGlnx7pVgYTYaqNpXrXLliKm+FxXGPMQ9Iwb11AV48nDUi39ZfaWIg7rTxz2<br />uCyfPpLgsXBFYiVuY+613H2KwOJLTDuXJ/hSQMZc<br />=y3Nu<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />

				Ordering some digital goods to boost your buyers stats is probably a good idea, some vendors will make you release escrow early if it is your first purchase.<br /><br />I&#039;m PMing you right now as well :)<br /><br />As for BTC being a hassle, give get-bitcoin.com a try, they seem to work fast and have a bunch of different exchange options.<br /><br />

				I find the digital goods very sketch. You have no idea if you&#039;re downloading more than just the book/video you ordered.

				Thanks for the info, Rapid and pulp - <br /><br />Pulp - I have read your guide several times, thank you for that!<br /><br />Rapid - I am hoping that good feedback will cover any riskiness in those downloads.&nbsp; I guess we will see!

				Yep, it&#039;s kind of hazardous lately, being a newbie, but you are ahead of most of them, by coming to the forums first, rather than buying haphazardly and getting off to a bad start or getting ripped off, which has happened a lot lately.<br /><br />Mostly, just show some caution.&nbsp; Latest constant scam around here is scammers trying to sell bitcoins which may or may not exist.&nbsp; Because of no escrow, they usually don&#039;t.&nbsp; As posted above, I&#039;d learn to navigate get-bitcoin.com, which, if you have a Bank of America, or Wells Fargo bank branch near you, is very easy....<br /><br />Second, I don&#039;t think all sellers require that newbies bypass escrow.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like it, but even sellers I like and trust often require it.&nbsp; They used to start threads about newbies who either wouldn&#039;t finalize or scammed, but now they just won&#039;t do escrow, which means the good suffer as well as the bad.&nbsp; Mostly, just make sure it is a reputable seller, here on the forums....the feedback on the main site no longer means very much, as it is all too easy to fake: get a bunch of &#039;buyer&#039;s accounts and just buy from yourself<br /><br />But in the forums you can tell who is good seller, who is chronically late, and who is total no-show.&nbsp; Best wishes to you, and I&#039;ve read thru all the posts in Security, and that is a great education, and pulpfiction&#039;s newbie guide also is great...or u can just pm people you are curious about, also...most are pretty friendly and helpful, tho asking publicly is better, so all can learn...

				Blues is right.&nbsp; No matter what you are buying, standard procedure should be to enter in the product type you are looking for in forum search and see what comes up.&nbsp; You can lurk through post titles and check out any sellers who might be interesting or who the community has annointed with &quot;scamming dickless-fuck&quot; status.<br /><br />THEN you go over to SR and shop with your new batch of information.&nbsp; Being here asking these questions is a great start (buying my cannabis if you are in US or Canada is the best start you can make on SR *wink wink*), as most of us who have been around for a while, either buyers or sellers, want this to be a community of commerce and peaceful cooperation and trade.&nbsp; Every scam gives SR a bad name and jades buyers, which hurts buyers because sellers pack up if volume drops off, and hurts buyers because that means prices go up and selection goes down.&nbsp; I would personally take a piss on every scammer&#039;s face if given the opportunity because they hurt my bottom line and rep of the market I sell from.&nbsp; <br /><br />So good on you for asking the noob questions.&nbsp; As you&#039;ve found, most of us are more than happy to help out because it is to the benefit of all, including ourselves.

				You guys are so nice, thanks for the helpful advice.&nbsp; I am definitely a geeky internet researcher, if nothing else.&nbsp; I have spent I-am-scared-to-count-how-many hours on this forum reading already.&nbsp; I am pretty proud of my old ass self figuring out BTC well enough to have put some money in SR AND figuring out PGP.&nbsp; Go me!&nbsp; I am a little sad I didn&#039;t find SR before now though.<br /><br />phubaiblues:&nbsp; I generally trust feedback, but thank you for the warning, I will definitely make sure I check them out on the forum too. <br /><br />Anarch - cannabis is the one thing I have what I think is maybe a lifetime supply of, as I restock every time I go back home (across country), and don&#039;t smoke that much.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Let me know if you get other goodies, I would love to buy USA (or North America, as the case may be!!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />&nbsp;I am usually pretty quiet on forums, out of fear of saying something moronic and getting my ass chewed out, but you all have been great, and I feel like I need to make myself known a little bit, if only for the trust factor.&nbsp; And I totally agree on asking publicly so other people can learn too.&nbsp; I know I am not the only beginner at all this.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is so fun - thanks again!
