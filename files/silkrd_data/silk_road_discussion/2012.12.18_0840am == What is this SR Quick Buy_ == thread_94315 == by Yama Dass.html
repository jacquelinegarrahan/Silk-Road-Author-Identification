				I&#039;m noticing that the top items in each category have a modified image for SR Quick Buy superimposed on top of their original image. The image also contains an incomplete wallet address. Has the SR image server been breached? What else do they have access too? Can anyone confirm they are seeing this also? <br /><br />For now I think I will be emptying out my wallet till I know what is going on.

				A lot of the images also have the addresses cut off/incomplete.<br />It is possible that some of these addresses are private or on another block chain.<br />I do find it interesting that they all link to different addresses though.<br /><br />Examples of incomplete or cut off addresses can be seen in the links below:<br />1) http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ea8eb1546a<br />2) http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/633e4081b2<br />3) http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ecc06f42f3

				Apparently this happened last night too, at about the same time, when the forum and most likely the main site have the fewest users (and no admins around), but last night almost nobody noticed. Maybe it was a quick test run.<br /><br />I think they are generating the bitcoin addresses on the fly and inserting them into the images so fast that they aren&#039;t even announced to the network and searchable on the block chain when you first see the images. Perhaps if we keep checking, more of them will show up. Announcing the addresses isn&#039;t critical. As long as you have the private key,&nbsp; you can claim the coins at a later date. It&#039;s just conventional to announce even unused addresses because people want to check and see that an address exists before they send coins to it.

				God you&#039;d hope to think not many would fall for it? Bound to be some.<br /><br />Nothing quick about typing out a Bitcoin address copied off an image, manually, vs simply sending it to the vendors account name via SR. Surely SR should just be put offline, if is possible, if in this state?

				Most of the people just for being here, means we are &quot;IT educated&quot;enough, we will never send money to those address unless an official announcement is made. It could be an attack , small but an attack since just the top products on the listings are being affected and its using social engineering in order to confuse users to send money to these addresses.&nbsp; Lets wait for an official announcements, but it does not looks like a big deal from an IT point of view.

				looks like hacked graphic library, something like watermark on pictures in e-shops you use, they are generated automatically by gd library in some script (it explain why it is again even when vendor reupload picture, some part of code generating this was putted there)... it do not mean SR was hacked overall, probably just some door issue into this graphic script, but still<br />hope some official announcement from admins will follow soon

Some lame ass skiddies must have found a way to inject the same &quot;SR quick buy&quot; generator code into every bestseller image regardless of size or any other constraints.<br /><br />I have a feeling that this may be LE trying to do their best to disrupt the market. The Australian feds admit to these kinds of operations, so just imagine what their counterparts in the US and UK are trying. Of course there&#039;s an equal chance of it being some l33t an0n h4x0r script kiddie. Any knowledgeable hacker would have rooted this server ages ago without tipping anyone off. SR would just wake up one day to find all the btc gone. Trust me, there have been plenty of opportunities in the past. Looks like most knowledgeable hackers respect this place for now, although that doesn&#039;t explain the lack of attention from the &quot;cybercrime ecosystem&quot;. Either they make too much money running scams or selling drugs on SR, or they figured hacking it in pieces would be more profitable (and practical) than pwning the whole market at once.

				What worries me the most is how they are able to delete or somehow &#039;bug-up&#039; the posting options. One could fear that they&#039;ve found SQL-injection, but seeing as they&#039;ve had to pull this silly &#039;alter pictures, remove shipping options&#039;-stunt (which honestly can&#039;t be very effective), they probably have very limited access.<br />If they could steal our bitcoins, they would had done it already.

My theory is that the hacker is someone with access to a vendor account, and that the SQL-injection &#039;hole&#039; resides in a user-input only accessible to vendors (like the user-input necessary when you create a new listing - the postage option input perhaps?). This would explain why nobody has found it until now.<br /><br />SR staff needs to fix the issue ASAP. If it is SQL-injection, it could be much more extensive than what we&#039;re seeing just now. If I was DPR, I would give out a BTC reward for finding holes in SR&#039;s security-systems and reporting them.

				Seems for marketplace, even a black market place, of this size the level of profit, there&#039;s been remarkably little feedback from DPR (or anyone else who is in contact with him), regarding what&#039;s gone on, etc, or defense, I know they can&#039;t have a team of computer hackers non-stop guarding SR, but a one man army doesn&#039;t seem to cut it. Getting harassed by a bunch of script kiddies. It&#039;s the lack of information that concerns me most, though.<br /><br />This is a lot worse than when the site goes laggy or down for a few days, genuine infiltration and partial overtaking of the entire system is really fucked up.

No one but DPR actually knows anything about how the site is run, which is how it should be. It&#039;s an anonymous market place on the hidden web selling a lot of illegal products. DPR obviously has very limited options on how the site is run. Let&#039;s give him/her a chance to make a statement and then go from there. DPR came through some difficult times recently so lets give him/her a go to rectify this problem and have a little patience.

				I love everything that DPR has done for the community, but I don&#039;t think he will be the man leading this revolution in the long term. We need a distributed market place software, open source and developed publicly (perhaps on Github, or a hidden service git repository), where anyone can review the code. With enough eyes, all security vulnerabilities are shallow, but SR is developed in secret by maybe 3-5 people. There&#039;s no way to know for sure that it is secure, until something like this happens, and then you know for sure that it isn&#039;t.

				The gist of this is that all users with a substantial amount of money in their SR account should withdraw it into their personal wallet(s). Hopefully DPR or an admin will come forward soon and address this. At least put a huge warning on the main page to avoid sending bitcoins to these addresses. However, who knows how deep the hackers have gotten (keeping the site mostly unchanged to keep up the ruse). Until this all gets fixed I will probably buy my holiday goodies thru tormail. I feel bad for the noobs that fell for this

				This does not look good at all and I would advise everyone to put their orders on hold until this is resolved.<br />If someone has compromised the Image servers/is able to push SQL code through then security could be in real danger.

				Hmmm guys...<br /><br />I withdrew my money to my client wallet and once my blockchain got caught up I didn&#039;t have my money.<br /><br />I checked to see where it went on blockchain.info, and it got split into its integer value and remainder, both sent to different addresses. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s some SR method of bitcoin tumbling and it will get here in a few minutes (it&#039;s already been 20 minutes now) or if my bitcoins just got sent to someone elses addresses.<br /><br />From my knowledge of SQL injections, it&#039;s certainly possible for them to modify a withdraw query string to set the recipient address to a malicious one, but I want to know if anyone else is having this problem or if I shouldn&#039;t be worried about this.

				the &quot;quickness&quot; of carrying out the hack depends upon what they exploited. ie cache tables, blocks, images, whatever.... each &quot;system&quot; has different data size limitations... think of it like a cardboard box.&nbsp; once the box is full, you can&#039;t put anything else in it.&nbsp; so you have to empty the box, and refill it.&nbsp; then after you do that however many times it takes, then you have to have all that dumped stuff assemble, then execute.&nbsp; i guess it&#039;s a slightly difficult concept to understand unless you are a techie.&nbsp; trust me.&nbsp; it takes time to mount a complete attack via just sql injection.&nbsp; the thing that is scariest is that they could have already locked out admin PRIOR to changing all the images and could be furiously writing code to further exploit the site (ie a completely compromised server)&nbsp; who says that admin still has access?&nbsp; why are they not saying anything right now?&nbsp; because they may be shitting bricks right now and now know what to do except take the site down...<br /><br />the pissing part is that most likely they hackers simply identified a security hole because admin didn&#039;t keep apache/solr/whatever properly updated.<br /><br />that&#039;s what happened to sony.&nbsp; just didn&#039;t install a server update.&nbsp; that&#039;s all it takes.

				Just posting here to confirm that I was able to withdraw bitcoins to personal wallet until things are resolved.&nbsp; Whoever posted above about the insufficient funds msg -- you can withdraw 15.07432 bitcoins, but can&#039;t really get the exact amount you have in SR because they round the number to the nearest .01 in $$.&nbsp; I had something like 20.07 BTC, and just withdrew 20.065 and it worked fine.<br /><br />I&#039;d also echo the sentiments re: timing -- how horrible right when everyone is putting in their orders to arrive before the weekend...<br /><br />I have some faith that things will be restored in due time... hopefully sooner than later.

Seems like most of the major vendors are being attacked whilst the lesser known/newer vendors are clear for now. I still don&#039;t get the point of having SilkRoad online when it&#039;s in such a shambolic state, if they took the site down a few days ago due to an influx of newbies certainly this is a good enough reason to do the same? It&#039;s making feel very uneasy, I&#039;m keeping off the marketplace until normal service has resumed.

				I was able to deposit funds without any issue. I didn&#039;t know there was anything going on until after I got my BTC and started looking at what I wanted to order. Messaged a vendor asking what the Quick Buy deal was all about until I noticed it all over and found info here.<br /><br />So no, it doesn&#039;t appear they have access to account. If they did, our money would be gone, they wouldn&#039;t be hoping people would randomly send to these addresses in the pictures. I&#039;m sure some have, but hopefully they didn&#039;t make much off it.<br /><br />Still bothered there has been no word from anyone of some power about this. I think it&#039;s because DPR is compromising someone&#039;s mother&#039;s vaginas as per another thread lol.

				My listings have been affected by this. I can confirm what was reported earlier; the altered images will return and shipping options will be deleted, even if the listings are manually fixed. I have been able to withdraw coins from the site still and I would ask that anyone who has an outstanding order with me, to finalize early. All placed orders have been sent and will be arriving within 2 days, but I would feel a little better not having money in escrow. It does take about 20-30 minutes for the listings to be corrupted and the site appears to be working normally, otherwise. If anyone is comfortable ordering, I will try to keep my listings clean, with shipping options. I will ask that you finalize early, but I will be able to get orders out before Thursday so they&#039;ll arrive by Saturday. <br /><br />Lastly, I have total faith in the Dread Pirate Roberts and so should you. I could write several paragraphs on why that is, but will save you all the time. This is certainly disconcerting and a large nuisance, as well, but it could be far worse and I&#039;m confident that DPR will come through.

				CalifornicationBuds, what if you post a listing with no image? Will the shipping options get changed?<br /><br />Also, despite your unwavering faith in DPR&#039;s ability to fix this, I find it mildly disturbing that they&#039;ve known about it apparently for at least 12 hours and haven&#039;t been able to remove the malicious code.

The image and shipping have actually not been changed since I last fixed them, which was about 25 minutes ago. I am going to leave them for now, in hopes that they remain as they should, but if it happens again, I will post a listing with no image and report back. I have a feeling the same thing would happen, or at the very least the shipping would still be deleted.

				Fuck me - got a call out - bribed with a cash incentive and a day off on pay so I&#039;m in work of all places and with a tech guru who also partakes in the delights of SR. He basically hoovered up some yayo I got off here, swore it was the best since business in Mexico! He will share his with me - just offered but I don&#039;t doing coke in work. He does, and has, so its a bit of a party here!<br /><br />Anyway, to this hack.<br /><br />I&#039;m a learner, know a few codes and understand how these sql injection attacks work on a basic level.<br /><br />We have decided that this was on the cards. SR, no matter how good it is, faces some VERY clever hackers and its all over the world now! The Russians used to take Windows apart whilst we simply just used it. They looked under the engine, as did China. We even have kids who can, by means of downloading a few kits, get up to chaos!<br /><br />But this is not kids. Nor is it LEA but it could be security services, having a work out or using that old excuse &#039;related to terror funding&#039;. I would imagine any of the main nations have people who could get into SR because whilst SR might be built and maintained by a team of maybe half a dozen, the states have thousands of programmers and dozens of almost genius level coders. <br /><br />My guess is that this is just a gang of hackers who have several operations on the go always and SR has been studied for weaknesses and even simulated so the hackers can get in, grab the coin, and move our before the site had to be closed for maintenance.<br /><br />Russians, Israelis, Europeans, Americans, anyone can be a suspect. They know they are hitting a site which cannot ask the police to help and therefore its not even high risk! In fact, every hacker who buys drugs off here will have studied the code. We studied it, not to hack, just to see how safe things were. So far, given its status, SR support staff have been brilliant. <br /><br />I knew we would see some people lose coin this Christmas, mainly with the usual vendor seeing too much money given to him/her by strangers! Christmas last rush buys!<br /><br />I am afraid some people will have gone for this easy buy option, sadly, SR can do nothing there. We all know that buying here is a risk anyhow. But, if the hack does develop into milkjing the actual funds here, and not just using the bait of no postage option and a &#039;Quick Buy&#039; offer, then moving funds out is a good idea!<br /><br />I have advised people I know to not move out and am messaging a few less than tech savvy buddies to watch out for this quick buy!<br /><br />I know people who would certanly assume the quick buy is a legit SR function. Anyone new here will not know about how to order. The hack might be just to milk a few hundred/thousand out of new buyers here or old ones desperate to grab that last minute present for someone!!!<br /><br />I had a vendor message me and ask for me to FE. I NEVER FE, but given the situation, I decided I will FE if the vendor sends an encrypted message. The message to pay may be the next stage in the hack - so if the vendor sends me an encrypted request, I know its not the hackers! They may be good but no way can they grab the private key needed to create a message from specific vendors.<br /><br />Just in case the message is a hack, here is what it says........<br /><br />_____________start of message____________________<br /><br />&quot;dear customer.<br /><br />due to the current problems with sr, I have to ask for FE.<br />You can be sure, your order arrives safely. It is already packed and was already on the way to the postbox.<br />But. there was a hack to sr which is not so big, but still, its a hack. you can read more: (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94315)<br /><br />Dont worry, you order is already processed, as I said. But I do worry about the payment which is hold in escrow on sr. I don&#039;t want it to rest for days on sr now. please understand. I have many orders and that is much money.<br />So, I can only send your shipping, when you finialize early and I get my bitcoin &quot; <br />___________________ End of message_______________________________________<br /><br />Now, what strikes me as strange is the fact I ordered last night (Tuesday) and the message says my order is already packed on on the way to the postbox. Then it says &quot;I can only send your shipping when you finalize early and I get my coin&quot;<br /><br />Does not make sense, unless my order, is wrapped, addressed, (and its tracked also, can you do that at night in Germany?) So - if I don&#039;t pay, then what? Its not posted? Wrapping taken off? <br /><br />I want an encrypted message before I release funds. Maybe releasing funds is how the hack also works.<br /><br />The vendor is atlas2012, fair trade hash. May be genuine, a message written in haste, and under the circumstances, I need a heart to heart with the tech guru who ordered way back for Christmas. Other people I know order now for Christmas! What is it with English people and the last minute buying of the Christmas and New Year stash? lol.<br /><br />Anyhow, lets hope the SR team get on top of this. Sorry if I seem blase about this but I really hope the customers here are not seeing funds stolen. <br /><br />Also, it would be foolish to order something right now as giving out your addy, during any hack, its unwise.<br /><br />Good luck everyone, and looks like the SR tech team gonna earn their coin getting this one sorted out!<br /><br />May be nothing, but would I leave thousands of dollars in a compromised site? No. <br /><br />So, should I finalize? And if something is on the way to the post box,and someone is asking to pay before its posted, is this actually showing a lack of social graces? Not sure right now - I&#039;m not a vendor but I guess many might ask for finalize right now as if funds in escrow can be grabbed, that would a LOT of coin go and a lot of people pissed off for Christrmas!<br /><br />I know a vendor here but he/she will be asleep. Not sure how they will deal with this.<br /><br />On a bright note I&#039;m on double time and got a bonus in my work but we sorted the problem in a few mins and are now talking about &#039;the SR hack&#039; and have emailed a few people we know are naive enough to release funds to this &#039;quick buy&#039;. We found some coffee and are currently smoking some hash. Still dark outside but we can see the distant glow of a major city.<br /><br />Good luck all. <br /><br />Hope my order gets through, I always have a fine selection of hash at Christmas, usually go to Hiolland and stuff an ounce, of bits and pieces of top hash and use stealth methods to bring it across the border.<br /><br />Down my underpants.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />We only get fined if caught. <br /><br />But now, we post and never lost anything also.<br /><br />Going to Holland soon anyway, love the Grey Area unless they gone commercial. Go to mostly Dutch and a few Morrocan cafes off the beatemn track. All owned by someone called Mohammed! At least its easy to remember the names of the cafe or shishka bars and cafes.<br /><br />Hope nobody gets hit too hard. <br /><br />In some ways, I admire the skills, but stealing off people, its actually wrong and those trying to seperate our coin from us all are not very nice people.<br /><br />Will be on this first thing in the morning, we are calling it a day now but book in to 6.30am. Back up at 10am! Ah well, fuck it, tghis weekend I got some mdma and lsd. Cannot wait! Hope all is well with SR by tomorrow.<br /><br />Red.

				Private Listings seem to be unaffected by the hack and the site is working properly, other than the shipping and images. I still will ask for early finalization, just to be safe, but if you look at my vendor page, you&#039;ll feel very secure in doing that. As soon as the order is finalized, you can know that it will go out as soon as possible. Right now, as a test, I&#039;ll be offering 1/8 and 1/4 oz listings.<br /><br />1/8<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9ce7beec54<br /><br />1/4<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3a3068e01b<br /><br />Lastly, I encourage people to stop freaking out.

The only other way that I can see would be to send the coins directly, via user name or btc address and send the address as a message. At this point, btc address would be much safer. This is against site rules and would normally get you banned, but I doubt that DPR would ban anyone who did that during this time. Obviously, it&#039;s also risky for buyers, but that risk would be up to them.

				I just wanted to say that I deposited money into SR today and it took 1.5 hours to get from instawallet to SR (which is the usual amount it takes for me to get a deposit on SR), so no worries there. I just placed an order and had no problems. I wouldn&#039;t panic and start cancelling orders and withdrawing all your BTC just yet. Everything seems fine. The vendor I just bought from had their most popular listings compromised by the hackers watermark (and the shipping options disappeared), but either they or the SR admins fixed something, because the shipping options reappeared and the watermark disappeared and I was able to order like normal.
