				Hi, <br />Some 3 years on Oxy prescribed. I have my mad moments with my script meds when I save a daily r so dose and eat the lot after x amount o time. I cant snort because sinus&#039;s well screwed/smashed after motorbike face-plant - wow wish I had on Avi file to up, cause believe me, tis was a good un, not my fault but even I wish I could watch it again, must have done 2/3 meters on my face, my lid (Helmet) full-face, didn&#039;t stand a chance, mmm taste of blood, this is bad, only thing I remember lol.<br /><br />Anyways sorry for going off in tangents and when I do again; my apologies, suppose its my meds r 2 blame&nbsp; ;D.<br /><br />Again. Oxy; LOVE it but I can easily do say 200mgs &amp; I choose to cap at that, (5x my script med tablet) and just does not last long. When I 1st did Oxy; it brought me back to my 1st drugs encounter, Gas sniffing days (then glue) in my early teens zx81 r was it Spectrum days (yes my age - lol), different but such a lovely feeling.<br /><br />So I&#039;m thinking mmm... what next, I no there&#039;s other Gear out there and better priced than Oxy. Sr opened my eyes so sooo wide. I have 2 orders of Oxy&#039;s, 1 on way another just placed.<br /><br />I count myself lucky as my wife has a decent job and is so supportive of my pain needs. I basically told her sum 15 months ago (relating to life itself, ashamed when i think about it now), and I will put this lightly, but I cannot see a future, pain 2 bad, doc&#039;s up their own butts and wont prescribe the dose I really need for pain relief, which 2 certain extent I can understand and I soon realized no such thing as pain killers, just relievers!<br /><br />Anyways, about a week passed after that statement, I was on net searching side affects of my meds and bingo, abuse time galore, so long had I been away from you. Google (vomit &amp; will never use again) brought to my attention of another way. So I control my meds, build em up and have a major blow out every x amount of time.<br /><br />But, tolerance is always always against you. so I am thinking, maybe a bit of this, then a bit of that and then... you get the idea because I know other gear is cheaper than Oxy 2 buy and a better hit?<br /><br />Side note: maybe of relevance but most likely unrelated ramble rubbish; my docs sent me for a few tests not that long ago: ECG (heart) counseling and 3 weeks where I had to go collect my script from the Practice. Well being in my state I complained about this immediately so collection didn&#039;t even reach the 1st hurdle.<br />The Councillor stated: She had never met anyone that could self diagnose own problems and sorted them out. I told her I wold have a &#039;quite talking to myself&#039; and sort my probs out. She was well impressed and cleared me as a non addictive personality, LOL.<br />Saying that, I have always been able to control Oxy binges to extent of weeks to months apart. I have x amount o kids and will never let them see me even drunk. And I count myself so lucky; I have such a loving wife which I don&#039;t wanna hurt intentionally - i think I&#039;m trying to build my confidence up here regarding addiction issues with other drugs. Again, I have always been able to stand up to Oxy cravings when I have gone over the top &amp; left days at least between . <br />*ECG, cholesterol and all other tests said I&#039;m up there with the healthiest... So thats my MOT done and passed with flying colors.<br /><br />So, I suppose this post is about what it says: what next, can anyone recommend what to try next and why? <br />The benefits of it say over Oxy - maybe even smoking Oxy as not done that yet? Is it worth it or go for another Gear?<br /><br />cheers and sorry for packing this out so much with crap talk.<br /><br />regards GoldenOxy<br /><br />As I just read on another post (sorry 4 stealing): I Love the Road ahead :-)

				That depends on what you&#039;re into. Psychedelics? Stimulants? Dissociatives? You mentioned that you sniffed gas before. You might enjoy nitrous oxide. It&#039;s a lot safer too. If you like that, you can try other dissociatives like ketamine or MXE. Try a small dose of shrooms or LSD to see if you like psychedelics at all. Try a small dose of speed to see if you like stimulants at all. The latter might be bad advice because you seem to have a rather addictive personality :D

				have you tried cannabis for your pain? i&#039;ve suffered with chronic pain for the last decade and the first time i ever experienced any sort of relief was when i started smoking daily. i would also recommend ketamine, as it&#039;s an anesthetic. you won&#039;t feel any pain while on it, but be careful! daily use can result in bladder and kidney problems.

				Weed is really great for pain, anxiety, social issues things like this. I think weed could benefit you but the thing is you need to find the right strain as well. I have had alot of good weed but different strains make me feel different. But Blue Dream is my favorite and I would recommend it for pain also, so it may suit your needs well.

				If pain control is your actual goal, ask about attending a pain management clinic. Also ask about fentanyl patches and lollipops.<br /><br />If that gets you no results, change doctors. Find a doctor who is a pain specialist.<br /><br />If you&#039;d just prefer to get high and have your pain managed as a bonus, THC (edibles are a good idea considering your circumstances) is probably the way to go.<br /><br />Ketamine is a fantastic pain-killer in low doses, problem is it doesn&#039;t last long, you won&#039;t be entirely coherent (even on small doses you will slur your words noticeably), and the usual route of administration is &#039;snorting&#039;. You could always use IM, but that involves needles (obviously) and a reliable, clean supply of ketamine. The chances of your family cottoning on to this are pretty high.<br /><br />Stay away from anything like meth, heroin, cocaine or speed. You sound like you have the addiction threshold of Charlie Sheen.

				Thanks for the reply&#039;s<br /><br />I have been in and out of Pain Management clinics for last 10 years. I have even had psychiatric tests, as Chronic Pain can sometimes be brought on by upstairs (head), that was not in my case, pretty evident from accident I had. <br /><br />I&#039;m in the position where I can take a minimum of 2x 20mg Oxy and OxyNorm 5ml (when needed) a day and store rest until when I feel need. I suppose I&#039;ve always had a pretty good constitution to taking stuff, even booze; my bikers days, I was always last 1 standing, be it booze or other stuff.<br /><br />moonflower and Harmful Hits, from another Chronic Pain suffer, keep strong and smile, its the key for me (I don&#039;t wish to sound patronizing here) -&nbsp; I tried weed out fair few years back, it just made my pretty weepy to be honest, just made me feel sorry for myself and that&#039;s not my character. Saying that, that was in early days and I don&#039;t moan on about shite that&#039;s happened anymore, so maybe another dabble pipe be a good idea, will look out for Blue Dream, love the name.<br /><br />Pain relief is a bonus of some of the Gear I am thinking about trying - but tis a bit of both I want, mainly; a reserve measure for when shit hits the fan with a flare ups, they are just not funny!<br />I must say that Ketamine does temp me atm, altho I am very aware of the side affects, as listed, thx firehawk. <br /><br />COOL; as writing this i got my 1st purchase thro, bye bye rest of Monday&nbsp; ;D<br />regards again and thx<br /><br />
