I&#039;m new to the forum thing and I decided to copy the format of the last person I saw post as a new vendor. Hence the reason we look so alike. It&#039;s kind of a hard thing to figure out a format that best suits the forum. I did the same thing in SR but with multiple peoples profiles because a lot of them stated exactly what I wanted to say. I learn a lot from reading other profiles and posts.&nbsp; I think I actually posted in the wrong area of the forum to begin with because of Express and my lack of knowledge about posting in the community. As far as the time zone, well I really cant explain that. I&#039;m assuming it has something to do with Tor. I checked my time setting in the setup for the forum and it looks like the time I am set to is the default forum time zone. So I figure that might be why.

No offense but your the other five feedbacks look a little too good to be true.&nbsp; I am not saying you are a scammer it could be just as likely you were a vendor somewhere else and knew you had a couple customers already in the market which helped you off to a good start.

				I have helped a friend on here ship items in the past. So I am not new to SR but no I have not taken any of his customers.nor do any of them know I have my own account. I seriously just know my stuff. I ship as fast as humanly possible and I know how to get the package through in the shortest time possible. I know a lot about the USPS and how they work. As far as people finalizing early I dont know. They trust me because of others that have bought from me I am assuming, so they went ahead and finalized early. I have never asked anyone to finalize early and I&#039;m not about to start unless I start getting scammers. There should be a level of trust between the buyer and seller. I&#039;m going to start a thread to show people I&#039;m the real deal and notify my buyers to tell their experiences with me on here. I&#039;m not a scammer. I&#039;ll set the scammers out if they try to scam me. Just out of curiosity, where would I start a thread for my customers to give their feedback? I am new to the forum thing.<br /><br />I recently made a purchase from someone that seems to good to be true and I think it may get ugly soon but Ill start that thread later if anything goes wrong. Actually I just made the order.

This is the busiest week for USPS. I went on ahead right after I made my last post and searched for vedor discussion forums. I started a thread for my customers. Hopefully I can get some to come over and post their experiences but who knows. I think I&#039;ll even add some incentives for them to post. We shall see. Thanks for the info.
