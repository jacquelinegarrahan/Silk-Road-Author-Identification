				They can&#039;t prove you got the package unless you sign for it. If you&#039;re really that paranoid about it you&#039;re probably better off not ordering it, or buying it from vendors whose shipping doesn&#039;t require a signature. Likely if they try to take you down they&#039;ll wait a couple minutes after you sign so you have time to open it. If you sign it and start getting a bad vibe, just wait a couple hours before you open it to be safe. Just because you signed for a package doesn&#039;t mean you know what&#039;s in it or who sent it to you, and as long as you don&#039;t open it there&#039;s no way for them to prove otherwise.

				Why the fuck would you answer the OP when you have NO CLUE what you are talking about!<br /><br />Red Rama&#039;s first few words are these<br /><br />&quot;They can&#039;t prove you got the package unless you sign for it&quot;<br /><br />That is complete bullshit. Signing for a package means NOTHING. It is no proof for anything!!!! There have been many threads in this forum over the last almost 2 years since SR started with actual court cases talking about signing for a package and how that legally means NOTHING. So Red Rama know what you are talking about before you answer this post. The OP wants actual answers. Not bad guesses by someone who clearly knows nothing about this.<br /><br />Red Rama then says this<br /><br />Likely if they try to take you down they&#039;ll wait a couple minutes after you sign so you have time to open it<br /><br /><br />What bad tv show did you watch to come up with this crap? I dont even think a bad tv show would provide this misinformation. You clearly have no idea what yo are talking about. You are just bored and figured you could give a answer and no one would call you out on it. Well you were wrong about that too.<br /><br />Whats really great is your last line. (here it is)<br /><br />Just because you signed for a package doesn&#039;t mean you know what&#039;s in it or who sent it to you, and as long as you don&#039;t open it there&#039;s no way for them to prove otherwise.<br /><br /><br />100% proves you know NOTHING as it totally contradicts your first line. LOL<br /><br /><br /><br />OP IKZ ------<br /><br />Sorry you have to had read a total, fucking lying, idiot&#039;s response to your paranoid question. At least you know you are just paranoid.<br /><br /><br />Your post is actually one that is not hard to answer...but you give such little information. I think you are asking &quot; I order drugs through the mail. I have never had a problem. I just go to my mail box and get my mail and sometimes there is MDMA in there. I want to know if I were to get in trouble for ordering drugs would they first send me a letter telling me I am in trouble? I only order 20 grams.&quot;<br /><br />You are not going to get in any trouble. If a package you order was to get siezed from US customs, assuming you are in the USA, then you would get a letter saying so(we call it a love letter) and waring you to not order drugs. They sent this to scare you and to legally notify you that your package was seized. 99% of the time this is all that happens. The other 1% they will follow up on the letter. Again, the amount is the #1 reason for why they would follow up. In your case it is to small of an order to follow up on. Now does not mean they for sure would not. But in all likely hood you would never see them again.<br /><br />Legally speaking if they were to seize it and send you a letter. YOU CAN NOT GET IN TROUBLE. If they wanted to &quot;bust&quot;&nbsp; you they would have to do a controlled delivery for 1. And that alone is not what gets you in trouble. BUT that would HAVE to happen. What they would do is watch you and try and find out who you are getting it form and if you are selling it yourself. And again with that amount, IF they were to find it, is why you would just get a letter.&nbsp; There is more to it. But those are the actual FACTS. Not some made up total BS like the first response you got.<br /><br />Also your package would have to be coming from out of the states. If it was domestic you would never get a letter. You would always get your package. There have NEVER been 1 person from Silk Road get in trouble. It is likely that it will happen one day. But not from mailing pills in the mail.&nbsp; And when someone gets in trouble, it wont be a buyer. This is a whole other can of worms. But to answer your post as you really didn&#039;t give us enough information as to why you think you would or could ever get in trouble... Just keep ordering and keep the orders small if you are a paranoid person.<br /><br />You are perfect for the forum. As this group as a whole liked to order there drugs then come in here and talk about the dangers of ordering online and just how careful you have to be. And how any day now SR is going down and DPR himself is stealing all of our BTC the minute you can not log into SR for 2 min. This group also believes that Silk Road should never have an issue and if it does then LEO has taken over and DPR himself is no longer running Silk Road. So keep up your paranoia! It is perfect for in here<br /><br />.BUT the gentlemen that responded to you, RED RAMA, has the most promise!! He is a star in the making! He is perfect for this forum. 100% completely full of shit. Knows nothing about what he responded too. But winged it and because he talked about possibly getting busted the HERO members here loved his response.In fact give this post a little more time and they will start responding to this and will act as if you actually did get busted. They will talk about there close friend this happened to.And they will actually make you more paranoid.<br /><br />So welcome to the SR forums...where the same 120 people out of the 15,000+ actual customers that buy things on SR gather and talk about how SR is a scam and every new person is a LEO. That is there favorite topic!! That this site is acting weird and it is because LEO is running it. And another favorite is that LEO is actually in the forums causing an uproar and is getting us against each other. Because that will take the site down. <br /><br /><br />These people really believe that is happening.

				Did you order from AH? He requires signature on delivery if you track your package...that&#039;s why I ordered with no tracking and 10g only for the first one.

Also consider whether you have a record, where you live (city cops are busier than country cops) etc etc.<br /><br />For more peace of mind you could always split your order up into smaller ones.

				That controlled delivery bullshit is only relevant for Muricans and their fucked up jurisdiction. In most countries (including mine) a delivery signature doesn&#039;t mean jack shit in court. Signing for packages you&#039;re not expecting and opening them is perfectly normal. What if you&#039;re getting a birthday/Christmas/whatever present via mail?

He has no issues! There is no reason at all to split up the order. That would actually cause him to be even more at risk..lol. <br /><br />I was saying that no one has ever been in trouble on SR. I was not trying to reassure anyone. I was just telling the OP and anyone else(like you) that does not know the actual facts.

In fact since you actually did give advice...where is your source for that wrong information? The OP has never had a problem. EVER. He was being paranoid and was not even clear in what he was asking. The OP actually made no sense at all. Kind of like your response ;) You need to re read my response and you will see I never gave advice. But I will now. You should actually read the OP. Then you would realize his post makes no sense at all. Then read the first responder. You will then see&nbsp; he just runs with it and has no idea what he is talking about. And he&nbsp; totally contradicts himself. I actually use facts to point that out. Then you come in with nothing to add at all. But since your nothing is not good enough for you. You decide to give him the great advice of splitting his order up. So even though he has never had a problem you think that the more smaller packages he gets the less likely he will have a package intercepted. That makes sense. :-\ If you got away with it 10 times. Try splitting it in half and do it 20 times! That will give you better peace of mind to know that you have now increased your chances of a package getting seized by 100%<br /><br />Can you be more clear on how many times he should &quot;split&quot; up his order to have peace of mind? Hell you might suggest a 4 way split!<br /><br /><br />Now before you make another&nbsp; post to explain yourself. Realize that all of us understood what you meant. And I am just breaking your balls. Yes your advice was terrible. Yes your advice is actually telling him to take even more risk and that will put his mind at ease. LOL. This is a great example of how someone should not post when they too do not understand anything.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t forget the OP. His post is even worse then your advice.

				If you are paranoid about receiving drugs in your mailbox then you are doing wrong and please stop do some home work and find a safer way to conduct your personal delivery method and/or site. There are countless ways to have your package delivered safely and you acquire it. General rule of thumb do not have sales merchandise delivered to the place you reside to sleep and seek peace from the world. <br />I&#039;ll not list the methods for LE to only document but seek knowledge and you shall find it, be proactive in your quest for an answer dont rely others to give you peace of mind earn it with self education it&#039;s better understood and appreciated by this means. <br />This has been another free example of common sense.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad bloodbath

There are published news articles linking people to SR. Vendors and buyers live in the real world, where packages can be intercepted. 20 grams of MDMA is not a trivial amount. That&#039;s 200 doses. I wouldn&#039;t say that OP has no reason to be worried.<br /><br />Never get complacent.
