				Any one notice that 2/3 of all the top 3% vendors are either in stealth or on vacation?<br /><br />Maybe they&#039;re not willing to allow their stats to get f&#039;d up while we&#039;re on this wild goose run!?!<br /><br />NCK

				But the new system wouldn&#039;t negatively affect them considering the volume they do. If anyone might be affected negatively, it would be new vendors and vendors who do low transactional volume. <br /><br />Maybe many decided to take a summer vacation for a week or two. Many vendors usually do in the summer but this would be a little late in the summer to take that vacation. <br /><br />Maybe they are taking time out to understand the new feedback system and come up with new policies to work around any perceived negative impacts that might occur or have occurred because of it. But that was what you were getting at with this thread, weren&#039;t you? LOL. Yeah admit it. ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Agreed. Strange thing going on back stage. Vendors either operating only in stealth, and some vendors just suddenly abandoning accounts that brought in major money. Some vendors just left, and never came back. Only explanation is an arrest.

				One of the reasons stated on the FAQ that a vendor would go into stealth is because they have too much volume coming in and they can&#039;t keep up with the growth. Of course you know, vendors in stealth are still able to be seen by the people who became their fans, well said by the Seller&#039;s Guide. I don&#039;t think vendors are selling to be in the 3% range. I think at that point, they&#039;re just trying to fulfill orders. If they have the customer base they need, I can see why they would operate in stealth until their current customer base slows down, or until they re-up with a lot of shit and need to start moving it.

				I actually really like the new the feedback system. It addresses the issue of Vendors maintaining near perfect stats even though their services aren&#039;t up to par with their stats. I think a good addition for the feedback system might be regional stats since some vendors have varying success in different regions of the world. For example, someone in the EU is far more likely to have a smooth transaction with a vendor in the EU than someone in the states dealing with a vendor from the EU. I think a lot of negative feedback comes from people who order stuff from outside of their region then get fucked by customs (even though they should know full well that that was a possibility when ordering) and then they accuse vendors of scamming and selectively targeting foreign customers...not saying that doesn&#039;t happen but i dont think it happens as much as a lot of people think it does.

It&#039;s a very elegant solution to a complex problem. To OP how do you know that the top 3% of vendors are no longer active? Seems to be a lot of the top vendors are still around. Is it maybe just the ones you deal with?
