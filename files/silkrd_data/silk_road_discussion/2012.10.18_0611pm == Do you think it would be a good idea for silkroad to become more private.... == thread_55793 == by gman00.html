				Absolutely not, privatizing silk road goes against everything it stands for. This is a revolution not a super secret drug club.

				It&#039;s really far to late at this point anyways.&nbsp; &nbsp; I mean if the US government wanted SR they would have it.&nbsp; It wont be shut down until people start dieing and the media reports on it.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the feds like SR keeps a lot of drug violence off the streets.&nbsp;

				Take a look at the suggestions forum. This idea gets suggested AT LEAST once a week. It&#039;s not going to happen.

				It would be less safe if it were more private.<br /><br />Everything about SR is designed to work little or no trust required.&nbsp; Even TOR is fully open source, closed source would be riskier.<br /><br />Think about it this way: Anything invitation only requires trust.&nbsp; As soon as your system depends on trust LE will develop a plan to gain that trust and infiltrate the group. <br /><br />

				Not in my opinion. Less people = less sales = less money = less profit. Everyone says this after they get here, but how would they have got here if it was private?
