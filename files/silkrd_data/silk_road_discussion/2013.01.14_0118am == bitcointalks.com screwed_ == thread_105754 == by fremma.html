				Hi everyone,<br />I am brand new to this SR and have been lurking around a little over a week. Well I decided to plunge in and buy some bitcoins and unfortunately didn&#039;t do my research on who to buy from. I placed 2 orders through them because they said the first one didnt go through but I have checked and they did receive payment. Since I used paypal do I have recourse to get my money back?&nbsp; I can not get them to give me my bit coins or have any contact at all. Anyone have any advise?

				Sorry, no. When buying digital goods, Paypal will not reimburse for purchase of digital goods.

				NEVER buy without first doing research.&nbsp; bitcointalks.com and virwex.com are both scams.&nbsp; Since you used your credit card and paypal, you can probably have your credit card reverse the payment, but I&#039;m not sure.&nbsp;

				I am really new to bitcoins/SR ... I hope I can get money back. They really got me good if not. I will definitely do more research from this point forward. All of it is a little overwhelming and just wanted to get started. You know what they say &quot;If its to good to be true&quot; Scammers Suck!

				Ring your bank and say someone has used your account to do fraud. <br />and they have spent $1000&#039;s on digital goods and PayPal are not being helpful in reimbursing you.<br />Your bank may be able to get your funds back, if not it&#039;s an expensive lesson you just learned.

				Exactly, you can do what&#039;s called a chargeback on your credit card. Be advised though, for that amount, the credit card bank will have to investigate. There will be likely be forms to fill out considering. But they will reverse the charge (basically, your credit card&#039;s issuing bank will eat the loss). There&#039;s a small chance that their investigation may determine that the charge was legitimate. You really think about your dialogue before contacting the CC&#039;s customer service. The fraud angle mentioned by midlandsmafia should work. <br /><br />Man, this is why those scammers spam so much. Looking to catch the uninitiated. <br /><br />For the future, definitely do research on how to get bitcoins. Look into bitinstant. They have an option to fund your account via a moneygram. Thousands of locations to execute a moneygram. <br /><br />As for vendors that sell bitcoins, sugarmama comes highly recommended.

				A thousand dollars in one scam. Amazing.<br /><br />Forget about how annoying the spam is on the forum. This guy has probably scammed over $10,000 from SR customers since he started. That&#039;s $10,000 that SR vendors didn&#039;t get (plus commission that SR didn&#039;t get). How much does he have to scam before SR admins finally put some proper controls in place?<br />
