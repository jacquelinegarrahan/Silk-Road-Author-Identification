				Shit&#039;s been wierd the last couple days.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had posts disappear and then reappear and then disappear again.<br /><br />Just now I click &quot;Show Unread Posts Since Last Visit&quot;&nbsp; and there were none, which didn&#039;t bother me because I had just finished reading everything and was just refreshing to make no-one had posted anything new in the last 10 minutes. But then 2 minutes later (I&#039;m an addict, I know) I hit ctrl f5 again and there were 3 pages of unread post... wtf?

				same here, a couple of my posts have vanished,<br /><br />even the post I just made in this thread about my posts vanishing.<br /><br />I wonder if the database will eventually right itself, populating correctly, and leading to a bunch of double posts,<br />or if all of those words will simply be lost in the aether forever...

This morning I posted this in the Technical Support section:<br /><br />Saw the threads about missing forum posts. I&#039;m sitting here with two tabs open in FF, each pointing to a different software version of the forum, each with different content. One is pointing to SMF 2.0, the other to SMF 2.0.1. People are reporting missing threads mostly in the latter version.<br /><br />This has been happening since a couple of days. Each time, after switching identities in Vidalia, it seems like a crapshoot as to where I will end up. If I&#039;d hazard a guess, I&#039;d say it&#039;s a DNS problem.<br /><br />I find this unnerving. Any insights? Or better yet, workarounds?<br /><br />Will post this to both forum instances if I can.<br />

				I know one day had some database issues and some posts were lost but I haven&#039;t noticed anything else since then. Just the usual having to CTRL+F5 on a page I&#039;ve visited recently to have it update to the most recent posts. Although I usually don&#039;t need to even do that much when using the Aurora Tor bundle. The standard Firefox 3.6 Tor bundle needs lots of refreshing. I haven&#039;t been all that active the past few days though, so I may have been lucky.

				I think I have lost at least a few posts in this whole ordeal.&nbsp; Not really a huge deal though, its just a bit weird when you look back at a thread and there is 10 less posts.

				It&#039;s as fastcat said ... sometimes you get version 2.0 and sometimes you get 2.0.1.&nbsp; There are two versions of this forum working almost parallel.<br /><br />I posted earlier today in version 2.0 a thread asking for SR to explain what&#039;s going on....&nbsp; Can&#039;t&nbsp; get back to that version to see if anyone has responded!<br /><br />An explanation would be great.

				^^ditto<br /><br />And this thread wasn&#039;t visible when I had to remake my account so when I posted(jokingly) asking if the Mods deleted my account for trash talking the Mesc I&#039;ve seen here I get some novel sized response from either a jr or sr member basically calling me a f*cktard for not seeing this thread which wasn&#039;t here when I logged in. Can&#039;t we move on to SR forums 3.0 and be done with the not knowing whether or not we&#039;re typing all these posts for nothing?

				I have a strange feeling that the posts the make it and the posts that don&#039;t are biased..<br /><br />any post i make about random bullshit makes it to the forum<br /><br />any posts i make dealing with marketing never make it...<br /><br />are the posts moderated before they appear?<br /><br />whatever if its a database prob it needs to be fixed...
