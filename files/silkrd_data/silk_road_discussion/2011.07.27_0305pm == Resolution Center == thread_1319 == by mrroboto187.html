				Hello all,<br /><br />I was wondering if someone could do a write-up on the way the resolution center works. I&#039;ve had 2 mix-ups while using it and I think if we had something on the front page or in the seller&#039;s guide it would clear things up for a lot of people. <br /><br />Thanks.<br />

				You pretty much hit resolve plead your case and your solution for the issue, the vendor looks it over and either agrees and resolves it or offers a new resolution.<br />If neither of your come to a solution within so many days Silk Road comes in and either helps with a solution or (takes the btc and disperses them into the hedge fund).<br /><br /><br />()....i made that up but is a possiblity.<br /><br />What has been your mix ups, if you don&#039;t mind me asking.

				Well, the first mix-up was that I sent a message in the resolution center that since they hadn&#039;t received the package after about 2 weeks I was going to give a 100% refund and because I was doing everything I could, I hoped they would still give me a good rating (I don&#039;t want any bad feedback especially when I can&#039;t really trust the buyer to be truthful, then I give a 100% refund. I think that&#039;s VERY decent on my part). Then, I saw the link that said &#039;give so and so a full refund&#039; so I clicked it. I&#039;m assuming it refunded the money because the resolution center disappeared along with all the messages. I guess he didn&#039;t get the message. So he just sees a full refund and that&#039;s all? This just seems like I&#039;m being shady. Really wish he would&#039;ve gotten the message I sent...<br /><br />The second one was that the messaging system in it is kind of tricky (for a newb). The seller sent me a message in there. I send a message back, but I had to put a percentage I was willing to refund. Of course I put 100% with the message, just thinking he would see that I was going to refund if we came to a resolution (I&#039;d rather have him wait a few more days) but now I see that he can accept my &#039;offer&#039; which I didn&#039;t know I was agreeing to.

				Buyers should PM the vendor first because the resolution has only 2 options: refund and time extension.&nbsp; Also, don&#039;t wait until resolution is available before contacting the vendor. If you are expecting a package in three days and it has been a week, it is time to start figuring it out. <br /><br />Do try and work it out, don&#039;t just do 50/50% and agree to disagree. Figure out the root cause of the issue so both vendor and buyer can avoid the mistake in the future. Be hard on vendors. &quot;Lost&quot; packages don&#039;t actually happen (way way less than 1%) so someone, not the post office, made a mistake. <br /><br />Minor issues can be solved though communication. Stay calm and allow 24 hours for a reply. If direct communication is not working, consider starting a forum thread. Be polite and state your concern. <br /><br />Try not to involve a Silk Road admin unless you have to.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I totally agree with everything you said. I&#039;ve heard that packages that are addressed to persons other than the actual occupants of a residence sometimes don&#039;t get delivered, do you think a fake name could be the problem?<br /><br />There have been more recent orders that went through so I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s my shipping procedures. I could be wrong though...<br /><br />I would hate to have to start using delivery confirmation but I can&#039;t keep losing money like this.

				If the seller really knows what they are doing than a fake name address is likely the problem. <br /><br />There are lots of forum discussions devoted to this topic and people argue back and forth. <br />I think the safest way for almost everyone is to <br />Copy the address exactly as in appears most commonly on the mail you currently receive. <br /><br />The way most buyers use fake names does not provide any protection and actually puts the buyer at more risk buy making the item stand out. <br /><br />An elaborate fake name and address can offer some protection in some cases but even then if they stake out a suspicious PO Box, only noticed because they were looking for fake boxes or because... well anyway... faking stuff introduces lots of new risks, most potentially worse.<br /><br />Buyers do have to trust vendors with an address anyway, but who is to say someone didn&#039;t use your name and address without your knowledge.<br /><br />So it is the safest and also happens to be the fastest and the most reliable. Sounds like a triple win to me.<br /><br />I understand that putting your real name feels wrong. I also respect those that disagree with me. I just don&#039;t see a likely scenario where have a fake name would do anything helpful and many where it would hurt.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

There should be no paper trail leading from SR to your house so there is no evidence of you actually purchasing anything. There is a thing as being overly paranoid.

				Not to thread jack but I do have a bit of question for other vendors (or buyers I guess). I recently sent out a bunch of edibles - I always send out 4 - 5 packages each time I send. So back around the 13 I sent out around 6 packages, 5 were confirmed within 4 days. This last one doesn&#039;t get confirmed and 4 days ago appears in resolution center and weirdly it&#039;s in there for a 20 day extension - with no accompanying message. Now I reply in both the resolution center and the in pm but am getting no response. What should my position be in this? Just seems odd. I must admit I am kinda OCD - so it&#039;s been difficult to stop thinking about it. Meh.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Agree with KB on this 100%. Sounds crazy and alot of people disagree but real name has been the way it&#039;s always been done 99% of the time.<br /><br />You can&#039;t control what comes to your mail, an enemy could send you something. Echoing what KB said before.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br /><br />Get shit sent in the wrong name cause problems. I did it before and the mail man knocked and actually wanted the guy named to sign for it, then the fuck gives me a card and tells me to have the guy come sign for it at the post office.<br />
