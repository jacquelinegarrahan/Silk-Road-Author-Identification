				i am interested in starting a vendor account, but i have very mixed feelings about it.&nbsp; See, i dont want to have to deal with the risk of it all without knowing that i am 100% secure.&nbsp; Before i dedicate myself to anything, i do a ridiculous amount of research and evaluating the situations accordingly...I didnt even start buying anything on SR for a couple weeks, just to make sure that i could get a significant amount of verification on all of security issues, package info, pgp, onion, etc.&nbsp; <br />I have very good plugs on addys, and 30&#039;s, others....&nbsp; and cant believe how much some of these things go for.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can see a VERY good return on investment...<br /><br />Any advice or helpful tips would be greatly appreciated.

				Say, <br /><br />You can also be a supplier to a vendor instead.&nbsp; Let the vendors do all the work and you&#039;ll never have to worry about security and all the stress.&nbsp; It could take months to establish yourself and in the end you would make about the same anyway.&nbsp; Sell bulk to a vendor once a month, instead of dealing with daily orders and packing, etc. . .<br /><br />For us, we grow our supply but Its waaay to much work running the vending thing and also doing the rest.&nbsp; We would rather just sell bulk to vendors as well.&nbsp; Its a lot easier and established vendors have a lot of customer traffic too!&nbsp; You will absolutely sell more of your gear if its in an established vendors store than your own store.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, you (or me) could make a mistake in all the flurry of having too many tasks to do.<br /><br />My challenge as a new vendor is getting people to come to my page or click my listings.&nbsp; Most people already have their fav vendors or only go with the big guys they read about in the forums.&nbsp; So, traffic is limited for any new vendor for a while.&nbsp; Cutting through all the 20,000 (yes its true that many) vendors is pretty tough.&nbsp; Everybody thinks a new vendor is a scammer.&nbsp; You also get abused/bullied and scammed a lot.<br /><br />Everybody wants brand name weed too.&nbsp; Most of the names are made up anyway just to get teenagers imaginations going really. I don&#039;t think lemon haze smells like lemons at all.&nbsp; Its just a name.&nbsp; Strawberry, grape, blueberry, etc. .&nbsp; Its all THC at the end of the day, but the name of the weed has to be exciting sounding.&nbsp; The name is more important than the potency itself sometimes.&nbsp; Marketing weed is industry in itself.<br /><br />Supplying a vendor, or putting your product in their store for commissions is a great plan.&nbsp; You won&#039;t have any trouble doing that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take care and good luck.<br />
