				hey guys, ever since I discovered silk road a few months ago, I have become more interested in computers, and how they work. From seeing Silk Roads dominance over the world governments who have been trying to stop it so far, I have realized that being able to use a computer properly is a very powerful skill. I have been considering purchasing one of the &quot;hacking for dummies&quot; ebooks for quite some time, however I am worried that either A: It will be a rip off and not teach me anything useful, or B: It will be too overly complicated for me to understand. Have any of you purchased one of these ebooks? And if so, did it teach you anything useful? If you give me a good answer, I promise not to drain your bank accounts of all your money once I have mastered the dark arts. Haha just kidding! ...or am i?

				You&#039;re probably better off joining a hack site, and looking for a &#039;suggested reading&#039; category, or something like that.<br />&#039;hacking&#039; is a very ambiguous term, and covers a multitude of different things.<br />Antisec, fraud, carding, ethical hacking, there&#039;s loads.<br />Pop over to hackbb on deepnet and have a poke around. Probably as good a place as any to window shop. lol
