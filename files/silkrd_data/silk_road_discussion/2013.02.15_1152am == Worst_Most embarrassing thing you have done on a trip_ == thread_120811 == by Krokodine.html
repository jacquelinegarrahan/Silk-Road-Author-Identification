				Quite a few years ago, my friend and i were frying on acid..they were called Mick Jagger Lips, well they had that picture on them.<br /><br />Anyway we walked into a convenience store, and i asked my friend what he wanted, and said &quot;chupa chups&#039;.<br /><br />I forgot to mention we had the major giggles before and once in the store, we just couldnt stop laughing.<br /><br />Anyway, i walked over to the counter and saw the massive large container holding all the chupa chups.<br /><br />I picked up the whole container and tipped the whole thing upside and spilled the entire contents of chupa chups all over the counter..there were a lot of chups in that bucket.<br /><br />I yelled to my friend what flavor would you like? He says Cola. I find the Cola chupa chup and hand it to the store clerk who just had a blank expression.<br /><br />I walked out with one chupa chup.<br /><br />That was some amazing acid. Although we were driving around in my town, a town we both knew quite well, we had no idea where we were...nothing like an earthworm breaking up the road in front of you while your driving frying on acid...ha ha.<br /><br />

				on a day trip to the netherlands we tried to cram it all in. i ended up having a double dose of shrooms and trippin balls in a coffeeshop, rolling up a joint about a footlong then smoking my way through and eating a massive bar of chocolate. i pulled a magnificent whitey, puked chocolate all over the floor and got kicked out. they made my friend clean it up because i was so fucked up :-[ i still feel really bad about that. she then had to get both of us to the airport in that state which was just like a magical dream. taught me a valuable lesson about taking it easy on the smoking when tripping.

I havent done much tripping, but my first LSD trip I was forced to drive in a fkn hurricane (not literally) of rain on a suspended license cause my friends couldn&#039;t handle it. Still had a good night tho, i actually thought I drove better lolol.

				I was walking downtown one night, tripping on about 300ug of LSD, when I came to an intersection.<br />I was thinking about which way to cross when I noticed a few cars approaching the intersection.<br />Quickly I hit the crosswalk button and stopped the cars at the very last second... then I walked into the middle of the intersection, pointed at the driver of the first car that had been forced to stop for me and laughed so hard at him, I thought I was gonna bust my gut.<br />I was all bent over, pointing and laughing, and then I realized how rude I was being, so I waved to him, and continued on my trip through the intersection.<br /><br />-Proud

				Nothing horrible or too embarrassing has happened to me while I tripped on acid, but one thing comes to mind. It was during the peak of my trip. I decided that I was cold and wanted to put on a jacket so I go all around my friends room searching for one, I finally find this big XL jacket(keep in mind I wear a S/M usually). I&#039;m not sure exactly how to put the jacket on. Well, I know how to put on a jacket, but at this point in time my body and my arms didn&#039;t agree with me. So I end up going feet first into the jacket and was unsure of what to do next, so I just pulled it up past my legs onto my torso and zipped it, so that the jacket arms were literally hanging off my shoulders and my arms were inside the jacket. I looked absolutely ridiculous and my friends were looking on laughing hysterically at me not being able to do this simple task. I wore it like that for the next 2 or so hours...Man, that was some strong cid.

				One time I drank 2 bottles of cough syrup that had about 750mg of DXM i think and I was tripping HARD. I can&#039;t recall most of the day but I remember crying hysterically when my friend pointed a toy M16 at me. When I saw it the next day, it wasn&#039;t even a life sized replica, it was about a foot long and I cried like a freaking baby.
