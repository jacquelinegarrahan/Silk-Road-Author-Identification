				Would be nice if we could get some info from the admin.&nbsp; Even if it&#039;s &quot;I don&#039;t know what the fuck is going on!&nbsp; Be cautious.&quot;&nbsp; But instead we&#039;re just left to be paranoid.

				Oh shoot, I thought this was going to be some kind of law enforcement or crazy conservative hacker threat. Then again it was a long shot considering neither of them have the brains to do anything mildly complicated, still I got my hopes up.&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(

				I&#039;m so scared of FatRocket, I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll come here and beats everyone up.&nbsp; And then he will physically attack the SR server, I&#039;m sure of that. Oh god oh god, what can we do? Should we run or just hide? I&#039;m freaking out, please take his warnings seriously!<br />Jeez, what a tool.<br /><br /><br />

				Gee, if the administrator know the frustration of sellers here, with an unstable server, don&#039;t know what he sees if the biz will continue. If this place gets worst I think people might start heading greener pastures.

				<br />Read the PGP signed message that was put up today while they had to restore the site.<br /><br />No need to chimp out and rage.<br /><br />Silk Road must employ multiple server instances that are bulletproof in nature,and have their own place in a hidden Tor directory.<br /><br />They will always do it that way - keeping us, and them- safe.<br /><br />There is no single &quot;Unstable&quot; &quot;server&quot; - they could have 20 server for all we know, ready to accept backup and on standby at the flip of a switch.<br /><br />Months of research went into Silk Road. It is highly decentralized and I can guarantee you - protected in every way possible.<br /><br />Their former providers were simply shady fucks and cut the site&#039;s wires for a bit. Silk Road probably just moved to another, better server and backed the site up in what I call a considerably good time frame.<br /><br />They also addressed many forum bugs while they were at it. Not to say I wasn&#039;t frustrated with the outage and the bugginess of this forum...but ya&#039;ll need to chill the fuckkkk out. We&#039;re very fortunate.<br /><br />There is no greener pasture other than here.<br /><br />:)

				OFFICIAL WARNING NOTICE FOR REDROCKET<br /><br />You buy and/or sell illegal drugs on a anonymous online site.&nbsp; You are therefore on the breaking edge of the &quot;battle&quot; and have no reason to complain if<br />the SR admin does not respond to you.&nbsp; You also do not pay for the forum.
