				I still keep seeing new post about users giving warnings saying they are getting ripped off and STILL finalizing early. I hate to sound like I am being mean or uncaring but really this has gotten to the point of &quot;you&nbsp; knew the burner was hot why did you tough it?&quot; I can not begin to say how many post are made from SR members who have been for a long time telling everyone NOT to finalize early.&nbsp; It is good to be trusting and want to help someone out by doing a favor as I have only been here about a month and have had a few vendors do me a favor and even send me something on credit with nothing but my word. This is greatly appreciated but I will not finalize early for any vendor for any reason. I will show my appreciation to that vendor in another way and make sure he/she knows their kind gesture was not in vain and not taken for granted but finalizing early is not one of them.<br /><br />Listen guys/gals who are new like me. Escrow is there to protect both you and the vendor so there is no need for you to finalize early. A good decent vendor knows this and&nbsp; will not ask this of you. For those vendors that do please forgive my outlook on this matter but it is requested and recommended by SR for a reason and it is a practice all should use in my opinion. If you choose to ask a buyer to finalize early I&nbsp; have nothing bad to say about you as it is not in my nature to trash or dog people for their ways or policy&#039;s&nbsp; on any matter unless morally wrong in the sense it hurts&nbsp; another person willingly. I.E stealing,abuse..etc..etc. To each their own is my motto. If a vendor refuses to sell to me without finalizing early&nbsp; if they have a product I want to purchase I do not like it and it sucks for me and the vendor cause it cost them&nbsp; coins and me a product and prevents us from building a buyer/seller foundation of trust&nbsp; but the TONY situation should be enough to show anyone that no matter how nice someone may be or cool they may be or how&nbsp; well their track/selling record is&nbsp; in the end a person can always be&nbsp; playing a con game and reeling us in like fish&nbsp; SO ALWAYS&nbsp; ALWAYS&nbsp; use escrow and never finalize early. Everyone&nbsp; keeps saying and telling this yet everyday I keep reading post and feedback of people finalizing early for a trusted vendor. Probably hoping to get delivery faster or get a bit extra weight or product. Use your head people and common sense and remember a good vender as&nbsp; with a good buyer earns each others trust by being polite,kind,helpful and paying on time when product arrives and being fair as far as feedback reviews and keeping our word. No matter if it is a vender keeping his word on when the product will ship and not say in transit on fri when it&#039;s not put in the mail or taken to post office till Monday or if it&#039;s the buyer saying he/she will pay extra&nbsp; for this or pay for a sample&nbsp; or just taking the time to sign on and finalize the moment you get your order. I had to do a return to sender on a product and was super rushed for time to get somewhere but I made it a point soon as I did that to log on and finalize the payment for the vender. It was not his/her fault I had to do a return to sender. I do not deserve any applause or right ons or&nbsp; good jobs from anyone for doing this as&nbsp; doing the right thing should&nbsp; be the default actions on everyone&#039;s part. I am just saying these are the type of actions the you as a new buyer should be doing and build a foundation of trust and NOT&nbsp; finalizing early. So I hate to say it&nbsp; to everyone who keeps posting they get jacked or ripped off&nbsp; it is your own fault and&nbsp; you danced and payed the piper for not using SR guidelines and commonsense. Chalk it up as a learning&nbsp; experience&nbsp; and find a vendor who wants to build trust with a buyer and him/her make coins and you get products and you will be happy here. In my month I have no complaints and have enjoyed chatting with everyone&nbsp; and enjoying my products.&nbsp; I hope all newbies will take the time to read this and let it soak in. You don&#039;t buy venders or anyone for that matters trust. You EARN it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have a happy mothers day everyone. If your mother is no longer with you I hope you find some happiness today in happy memories and know that she is with you today and will see you again in the end. According to my religious views anyways. If yours differ I hope I did not offend anyone. My mother is sick so I am going to share a bit of a product with her (again the vendors here&nbsp; making a difference in one good persons life by what they do)&nbsp; and cheer her up a little so she can enjoy her day and spend&nbsp; the day with her&nbsp; while I can be with her. Those of you whose mother is still around&nbsp; take some time to look around you and be thankful&nbsp; shes here as in a matter of seconds the ability to just hear her voice or give her a phone call could be gone. JUST LIKE THAT!&nbsp; Let&#039;s all be thankful&nbsp; and think back to the days&nbsp; of coming home from school watching trandformers and gi-joe or waking up on&nbsp; a sat morning&nbsp; to the superfriends or thundar the barbarian and having her there to just say I LOVE YOU. The same way those memories are in the past and gone the memories we build TODAY will soon be in the past and gone. Only back then we did not know enough about life to cherish that moment and see it for what it was.&nbsp; &nbsp;back then it was just another day or another sat morning of cartoons&nbsp; to use and not the cherished time we know it as today.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry for the&nbsp; rant woke up with a nice dose and just wanted to try and start everyone&#039;s day off on a good note. Take care everyone. Hope you all had a safe and FUN weekend. <br /><br />

				Fuck me, have you heard of commas? Anyway, I didn&#039;t read it, but I assume your point was something like &quot;don&#039;t FE and if you do don&#039;t whine about it because I have to look at the forumposts and it&#039;s really hard!&quot;. I kinda feel like I&#039;ve heard that before...<br /><br />Listen, a lot of vendors require FE, and yes, it IS a really unsafe option for the buyer, but in the end, it&#039;s up to the buyer if he wants to take that risk or not. And if the buyer does take that risk, I would like to know if it works out, and if it doesn&#039;t, I want to know the name of the vendor so I can avoid him. Surely this is in everybodys best interest.

				I don&#039;t know, I haven&#039;t made a purchase yet since I&#039;m still waiting my coins, but like NorthSouth says, its up to the buyer to take the chance here, at least initially.<br /><br />I&#039;m new to all of this, and except for a few posts, the sellers on here have no real way of knowing whether or not I&#039;m &quot;trustworthy&quot; with my payments.<br /><br />For the products I want to buy I go and read the vendor&#039;s instructions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of them say something to the fact that &quot;if you have less than 5 transactions, or 3 transactions&quot; or similar, you need to FE.&nbsp; I&#039;m OK with that, because that&#039;s allegedly how to build that elusive &quot;trust&quot; thingy.<br /><br />And after I reach that magic threshold where I don&#039;t have to FE by default, I&#039;ll stay in escrow and clear the payment once product arrives.<br /><br />Just make smaller purchases initially so in case the seller DOES fuck you somehow, you can come back to the community and voice your grievance in an open forum.&nbsp; I doubt the seller will not be willing to work something out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simple and to the point.&nbsp; No need for all the BS about not FE.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s what you need to do when just starting out.<br /><br />Omega<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I agree with the above post and the original post.<br /><br />To me there is no debate and I will not finalize early for any reason. Finalizing early is a serious privilege imho and it can be easily abused. <br /><br />Once I have an established relationship with a supplier (i.e. we have communicated via pm, have had a few successful bulk transactions, etc...) then finalizing early will be an option.
