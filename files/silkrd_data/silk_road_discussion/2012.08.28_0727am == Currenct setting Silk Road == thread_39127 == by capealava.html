				My currency setting is on Thai Baht. I assume because I live in Thailand. The prices are coming all wrong it is obvious. Anyone know how to change currency setting in Silk Road.

				Hi capealava,<br /><br />The prices shown are actually in Bitcoin, which looks similar to the Thai Baht currency symbol. Go into your account settings and select &quot;display prices in Dollars&quot;, then click update.<br /><br />The prices around the site will be shown in USD, and the prices in your cart will be shown in Bitcoin, with a USD total beside the BTC total.

I live in Europe, so I just check out the latest EUR/USD rate and divide my purchase by that (e.g. €1 = $1.25). In the case of a purchase worth $100, I divide that by 1.25 and come up with the Euro cost, which would be €80. It literally takes 2 seconds to do that, and eliminates the need for multiple currencies to be listed.

It just makes you look foolish.<br />I&#039;ll lay it out simply, and spaced, so as it&#039;s not too taxing for you to follow.<br /><br />If your currency is the Euro, for example, and you wish to see how much a product costing ฿70 is in Euro:<br /><br />Your product costs ฿70 ($763.245 at $10.9035 per Bitcoin) - the part in parenthesis is shown after the total in your cart.<br />(If you have more than one item in the cart, you can of course just multiply the number of Bitcoin it costs by the $XX.XXXX per Bitcoin, then divide that number by your currency exchange rate; however, I fear I may be losing you here so I&#039;ll get back to the issue we were discussing.)<br /><br />The current EUR/USD rate is €1&nbsp; :&nbsp; $1.2567 (you can check this on Google Finance any time of the day, and it will vary.)<br /><br />Given that you now know the exchange rate, you divide $763.245 (the total cost of your product in USD) by 1.2567 (the current exchange rate of EUR/USD) and you get 607.340654094, or 607.34. That is the total cost, in Euro, of the product.<br />Just to clarify, this means that your product costs €607.34 in Euro.<br /><br />If you were to multiply it by 4, as you seem to think is necessary, you&#039;d then get €2429.36 which would indicate that your basic math skills aren&#039;t up to scratch and your time insulting people might be better spent reading up on how to divide correctly. I see you think there&#039;s a need to divide things into fifths for some reason, which there&#039;s not. You then think you need to multiply it by 4 to get four-fifths, which again puzzles me.<br /><br />As for the following:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39127.msg436891#msg436891">Quote from: username100 on August 28, 2012, 04:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> And yes I do have to do it for every god damn listing because how else am I supposed to know which ones I&#039;m interested in if I don&#039;t nkow the price?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you see one listing for ฿70 - having worked out how much that is in your currency - you&#039;ll have a general idea of the price of things that cost more or less than ฿70.<br /><br />OR (and this might sound REALLY crazy!!) you could do what most people do and set the product prices to be shown in USD rather than Bitcoin.<br />Once you see a price - in Dollars - for something you&#039;re interested in, all you need to do is divide it by 1.2567 (assuming Euro is the currency you want to use) and there you have it, your price in Euro. This takes all of 2 seconds on a calculator. Most phones have one, if you can&#039;t get your hands on an actual physical calculator.<br /><br />You can also safely assume that a listing which is valued at a lower dollar amount is actually cheaper than the previous listing you&#039;re comparing it to.<br /><br />If you wish to apologise for insulting me simply because you failed to understand something, feel free to do so. If you don&#039;t wish to do so, that&#039;s alright too, we can still be the best of friends.&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />- grahamgreene

Should the exchange rate drop back down to €1.00 : $1.18 tomorrow, your method will make every $1.25 worth €0.944, again giving you the wrong figure in your currency.<br /><br />Therefore the ONLY method you can use to give you an exact figure in your own currency is by dividing the listing price by your current currency exchange rate.

I&#039;m trying to help you out here, there&#039;s no need to be so ratty.<br />I&#039;ll use a GBP example.<br /><br />Your product costs ฿70 ($759.157 at $10.8451 per Bitcoin)<br /><br />The current GBP : USD exchange rate is £1 : $1.5827.<br /><br />Using your method, dividing the product cost by 5 and multiplying the result by 4 = £607.3256<br /><br />The ACTUAL cost of the product in GBP, found by dividing the USD amount by the GBP exchange rate = £479.6594<br /><br />With your method, you overestimate the price by £127.6662<br />Are you STILL maintaining that your method is correct?!&nbsp; :o

One of you is better at maths than the other one! ::)<br />Graham if you&#039;re correct and username100 has got his maths wrong, then haven&#039;t you proved his point, that his life would be made easier if he didn&#039;t have to convert the currencies in his head! If Silk Road did it for us then there would be no human error. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s not about one being better at maths than the other (I&#039;m actually TERRIBLE at maths for what it&#039;s worth), it&#039;s about showing a system that one can easily use to find the price of something in their own currency, which is what I was demonstrating. It would of course be easier if we didn&#039;t have to convert the currencies ourselves, but it does take very little time using a calculator.<br />We&#039;re using a revolutionary site, one which enables us to buy drugs over the internet from the comfort of our own homes. We don&#039;t currently have a multiple currency option, so I provided the most simple way of finding the price in your local currency. There&#039;s obviously a reason that this hasn&#039;t been implemented yet despite the huge demand for it, as there was plenty of scope to do so during the recent site re-design. I can only assume the reason for this is because of a potential security risk, as that&#039;s the reason the BTC/USD rate was removed from the main site in the first place.<br /><br />I&#039;m all for a multiple currency option though, don&#039;t get me wrong! As for the script written by one of the new members here, if any of you are going to use that I&#039;d advise you to look through the code very thoroughly before implementing it.
