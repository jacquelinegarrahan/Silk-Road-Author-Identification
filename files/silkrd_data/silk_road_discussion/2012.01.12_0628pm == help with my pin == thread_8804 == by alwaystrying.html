				Grhh, it sucks when SR slows down so much when your trying to figure something new out. And the TOR version they begged me to update to..

				well I feel a little like an ass, but have concluded that the problem is with the password storage system. The password that I KNEW had to be my 2nd password,, if I had one, finally worked after trying it the 3rd time, on my final login attempt. I&#039;m totally afraid to change my passwords again, hope that SR gets this resolved soon.

				Yeah that&#039;s exactly what happened to my account too. I honestly do not have any recollection of setting up my pin when I created account last year. Even if I set it up before, I probably forgot it because I never had to use it for past couple of months. I deposited some bitcoins during maintenance....but now I am stuck with BTCs. I tried to guess possible PIN, but I lost all 5 attempts, and received an automated message from SR Support saying that to get my PIN reset, reply to that msg, which I did last about 18 hours ago and once more few hours ago. But I haven&#039;t heard anything back yet. Now, BTC value is going down, and I can&#039;t buy products that I had in my cart now.<br /><br />I wish we,buyers, were notified a week before this update that we would need to have&nbsp; PIN in order to make purchases from now on. I respect SR people for everything they do, but this update was just unexpected and causing unnecessary delays/problems/worries. Had I known that PIN would be required from now on to make purchase, I would have created just another account and deposited my BTC to that new account. To my knowledge, I don&#039;t think SR ever announced this plan previously (correct me if I am wrong). <br /><br />Anyways, meh....... I will keep you updated. Let me know if you find some solution.<br /><br />Oh also, if any admin sees this, could you please reset my PIN and send it to my inbox? I have some urgent order to be made by tonight. My SR id is same.. Thanks for all your work.

				This pin bullshit is completely ridiculous.<br /><br />It would have been VERY nice to know this was going to be required for purchases ahead of time. Thanks for the notice, SR, it was a big fucking help.<br /><br />I was going to make a sizable purchase today, only to find out that PIN is now required, and after entering every possible PIN I could&#039;ve had it has been automatically reset and now I am supposed to message SR support in 7 days to confirm my account. WTF?<br /><br />And who the fuck refers to a second password and PIN as the same thing? That&#039;s pretty ambiguous. <br /><br />This implementation is highly confusing, poorly done, and seemingly unnecessary. It is frustrating as hell to say the least, because now I have funds tied up in my account that I can&#039;t even use because SR has locked me out of my own PIN. <br /><br />And now it looks like I have to wait a whole other week to make a purchase I was ready to make TODAY before finding out that this shit had been forced on us with no prior warning.<br /><br />Now here comes a string of vile curse words so that I can better vent my anger: Motherfucking god damn bullshit!

				i think its just an additional precaution. obviously there&#039;s a lot of issues implementing but hopefully it&#039;ll work for the best in the end.<br /><br />after messaging them and being told it was reset. i kept trying my pins. Once that was out of hope i got the 7 day message; replied stating it had already been reset and my circumstances and fortunately a day or so afterwards i was prompted for a password.<br /><br />whether that was already in the works or my reply helped them, i don&#039;t know.

				Your PIN is the secondary password you were asked to set, either at the creation of your account or afterwards. If you do not know your PIN, take some guesses, after 5 attempts it will lock you out and you will receive an automated message about Resetting your PIN. Reply to that message 7 days AFTER receiving it to get a new PIN. This is for your own security to make sure there are no other request for your account, a step taken to stop the phisher problem or at least severely reduce it. This will keep a phisher from getting your pass and just requesting a reset and taking your money, or making an illicit transaction and finalizing to take your money. I&#039;m sorry for the inconvenience but this is for your safety. Please be patient, our admins have a lot on their plates.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				DigitalAlch, the confusing part is that SR says wait 7 days after we&#039;re locked out and then the pin will be re-set but what does that actually mean? Is the original pin (that we couldn&#039;t remember in the 1st place) reinstated, is there a new pin created by SR (in which case how do we find that out or know what that is) or do we then have no pin and need to create a new one?<br /><br />This may resolve a lot of confusion.<br /><br />Thanks.

I was asked to set a second password soon after signing up late last year, and starting to learn SR. I never knew what the &#039;backup password&#039; was for,at all. I assumed in case I forgot my log-in password.&nbsp; &nbsp;So when they started calling it a PIN and requiring it for purchases, I was really thrown off. Not to mention ALOT of people here were changing their passwords, only to find out that neither worked for a period of time.&nbsp; The PIN idea is a good one, the flaw being that people were never notified of its importance or application, which just doubles confusion and frustration.<br />

				Once they reset it, write it down. Or stick it in your phone.

				Mother fucker....now I&#039;m in the same boat. <br /><br />Went to place an order the other night and tried my second password to no avail. Tried every other password it could be and still nothing. Before using up all 5 attempts I used the &quot;contact us&quot; link and sent off a message stating my frustration and concern and requested help. I&#039;ve got all of 4.xx bitcoins in my account and now I can&#039;t even use them. I understand the security precaution but fuck me - I just want to place my order!<br /><br />*edit* Durp, didn&#039;t use spellcheck

				If you write SR support a message asking for help after you receive the form letter they will help you out.&nbsp; &nbsp;I let them know I was frustrated with the situation and asked if they could do anything and the next time I logged in I was taken to the set secondary password page and no problems since then.&nbsp; Just make sure you&#039;re patient and can give them a few hours to answer you; I imagine they&#039;re busy<br /><br />

				Just received the &quot;Message me in 5 days&quot; message in response to my request to reset my pin. Sooooo, now I wait I guess. Hopefully I am one of the lucky ones that miraculously gets the early pin reset upon login, but being as though it&#039;s about to be the weekend and I don&#039;t imagine too many vendors are going to be sending out orders anyway, I guess it isn&#039;t all that bad&nbsp; :-\
