				I&#039;m not all the active on the forums here so I know my opinion won&#039;t carry much weight but I have to agree with DaFuck on this one.&nbsp; I could understand if he directly insulted the vendor or if even used vulgarity (but freedom of speech is a big one isn&#039;t it?) but he did not. <br /><br />The only item is question was the comment about bleeding out his rectum. While not very tasteful, it does not rise to the level I would expect of a&nbsp; 100 day discussion ban.&nbsp; This new feedback system has it&#039;s pros and cons but this is a major NO in my opinion. <br /><br />He criticized a vendor without using vulgar language or insulting the vendor. What gives?

				My apologies for the cluttering up of your threads. I only wish to have some kind of voice on the forums when you open up for discussion on particular topics. I will also apologize if you feel I was impolite or my tone was scathing or something, that was not my intention. I am intending to be sincere here, not sarcastic with the apologies, please let that be clear here. I am just interested as to why my posts in particular were deleted? Were there not other contributors to your threads that were also off topic? And were their posts deleted as well? Thank you at the very least for responding to me directly.

				this was directed at me and my psilocybe cyanescens<br /><br />Like tesselated, I too used to pick liberty caps all the time. I&#039;ve been picking cyanescens for over 30 years. They are not that hard to distinguish once you master them. I have mastered them<br /><br />However i can&#039;t send whole mushrooms because i can&#039;t send packages, or rather, i can&#039;t get postage for packages and stay anonymous, so I have to powder it and send it nice and thin<br /><br /><br />Not that sending whole ones would do much good because because you likely would not be able to identify them when they have been dried, and the must be dried. In fact, being able to powder them is one indication they are dry enough. If they&#039;re not dry enough, they won&#039;t grind up. If they are not dry enough, they will also develop bacteria and rot, just like any vegetable, which is actually where most poisonings come from<br /><br />there is a misconception about mushrooms and it comes from ignorance and not being educated. There is absolutely NO reason why anyone in 2013 should get poisoned because of mis-identification of mushrooms. There is a huge amount of documentation of the clearnet, with more photos you can possibly imagine and places like the Shroomery where you can send in photos and experts will look at them<br /><br />All I can do in this situation is tell people I&#039;m an expert. I have vended for nearly 6 months with no problems whatsoever. Nearly 100% satisfaction. Nobody is going to get poisoned from my shrooms. It ain&#039;t gonna happen. You might think it&#039;s possible if you are an amateur and don&#039;t know the species, but once you know it, you know it. It&#039;s impossible to go wrong<br /><br />It&#039;s no different than picking morels in idaho or whoever. Once you learn you morels, you can pick them year after year with no problems. Every year the same people sell them on Ebay, with no problem<br /><br />The problems come from amateurs...I am not one of them<br /><br />Anyway, I apologize for blowing up about it, but it drives me up the wall when I can&#039;t seem to explain enough that I&#039;m an expert and people don&#039;t believe it&#039;s possible..or something. If you don&#039;t believe it, then just don&#039;t buy it<br /><br />I have plenty of true believers already..repeat customers..They are happy, and they are happy with powder. It goes down and mixes easier anyway<br /><br />and btw, I&#039;ll be glad to answer any w questions about how they are identified. It&#039;s not a secret. It&#039;s extremely well documented, and so are liberty caps. They&#039;re just hard to find unless you have experience<br /><br />It&#039;s true that in terms of population percentage, there aren&#039;t that many real experts. Lots of amateurs, but few real experts. Lots of people go hunting for cyanescens and liberty caps every year. the season already started in UK and Norway. look it up in the hunting section at Shroomery.org<br /><br />Tessellated knows. he&#039;s been out in the cow fields..So have I..we both know that once you really learn, then you know. It&#039;s not that hard unless you&#039;re completely color blinds or have bad eyesight

				renal failure and vascular collapse are two of the symptoms of toxic mushroom poisonings, most notably amanita phalloides. aka death caps. Blood in the stool and urine is one of the sypmotons. That species is the most common poisoning in north america, usually from south east asian immigrants who mistake them for edibles in their home country<br /><br />mycological societies send out warnings every year in many languages because of this. The are big white and yellow mushrooms with white dots on them. They are mistaken for other big white ones that are edible. <br /><br />They are never confused with the much smaller brown and blue psilocybe species although other little brown mushrooms can also be toxic and contain the same amatoxins, like gallerina autumnalis and Those have rusty brown spores where psilocybes have purple brown spores. It&#039;s not that hard to tell the difference once you learn it, see this part of my thread for more<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137891.60<br /><br /><br />That is not something that&#039;s made up and is a legitimate concern, but again it would be a concern if a vendor did not know what he was doing<br /><br />Ironically, what is much more common and I&#039;ve seen this in this forum is diarrhea cause by bacteria because good cubensis were not dried out correctly. Historically, dealers do this because water is weight, and if you don&#039;t dry them out, they weigh more. But they will also rot, like any perishable vegetable and bacteria cultures will start to grow and eat the flesh of good mushrooms...That is why all mushrooms must be delivered and eaten and refrigerated while fresh within 1-3 days, otherwise they MUST be dried. Drying them kills the bacteria. Bacteria need water to survive<br /><br /><br />this also happens in the wild with p cyanescens and other wild magic mushroom once they&#039;ve passed their peak. they will rot. they will turn dark and start smelling really nasty. They will make you sick, but not kill you. instead they&#039;ll make you sit on the toilet for a day or two, and while tripping. Bad toilet trip if you don&#039;t handle them properly. Tripping balls while sitting on the toilet is NOT fun<br /><br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s a legitimate concern and it DOES happen. That type of &#039;poisoning&#039; is more common and usually happens with inexperienced or unscrupulous cubensis vendors. Experienced and ethical vendors that will never happen, like the other top vendor who also powders his mycelium mushrooms, USAshroomz and his Galindoi<br /><br />I don&#039;t even have to ask him since he&#039;s had plenty of experience and no reports of toilet tripping, I know he dries it out completely before shipping<br /><br />If you can bend the stem without snapping it, it&#039;s not dry enough. Especially it it starts smelling nasty, don&#039;t eat it<br /><br />This, btw, is one of the reasons we use moisture barrier bags and vacuum it. It&#039;s not just stealth, but to make sure they are kept dry

				i have picked Cyanescens for about 20 years and what cyanspore says is true.<br />once you know what your doing its impossible to mistake it for a look-alike.<br />but i watch people who are new at it pick the wrong ones all the time.<br />you need to do a close inspection of the stem,gills,cap,colour of the spores<br />then you know you got the right one.

				While reading this thread, I would like to recall a story from a guide while trekking one time in the American SW. I bring up something regarding local edible plants while hiking, and he goes into a story of a PHD mycologist harvesting some wild fungus which he misidentified, then turned into pasta sauce. Turns out the species was extremely toxic and the professor, along with 2 other Grad students died.There are many taxonomic differences, morphology,spore structure.. et cetra to be cognizant. Even the pros can make mistakes especially when you&#039;re biased in your infallibility... &quot;Positive Results Bias&quot;

				yeah I&#039;ve heard those stories to. They are mostly just stories. On very rare occasions experienced people have made mistakes but unless you can find the news article on it, it&#039;s just that, urban legend, and is the very thing that contributes to the fear and ignorance surrounding mushrooms. I aim to not just vend here, but destroy fear and ignorance surrounding mushrooms. There is no reason for it in 2013 with the internet. When i started hunting 30 years ago, there was no internet. All we had was a couple of shitty Audubon books with crappy pictures and nothing else. It was mostly word of mouth back then and even then we managed to figure out which ones were right<br /><br />To sit there and tell me people can&#039;t even get a rudimentary education on something they are going to ingest just smacks of laziness. This holds true for ANY drug you buy here on SR..Do you know how your coke is made?..Your LSD?, Your pills?..Your other powders?<br /><br />I eat my own mushrooms regularly and have done so for years. I trust my own ability more than i would trust a manufactured substance, because as far as I&#039;m concerned, as long as you correctly pick the right species, it&#039;s guaranteed. I know what I&#039;m getting. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m getting in a pill, or some other man made powder, do you?. Basically, I have a really really hard time believing people are that idiotic that they would trust a man made pill or powder over a correctly identified psilocybe mushroom. It just doesn&#039;t make sense. In terms of my mushrooms being powdered, the only reason why it would be suspect is the suspicion that it&#039;s adulterated. That is to say,&nbsp; something is ADDED to it. There can&#039;t be any question of whether or not the powder was made right in the first place because it isn&#039;t made, it&#039;s grown<br /><br />BTW, I just changed my listing to reflect the following<br /><br />I cannot send mushrooms whole not because I can&#039;t send them whole or get packaging. It&#039;s because where I live I can no longer buy POSTAGE for packages with cash. It&#039;s all automated now and you cannot buy postage at the post office anymore. Only stamps. For packages you must use a machine now and they don&#039;t take cash<br /><br />ALL post offices will be going this way eventually, so it&#039;s only a matter of time before everyone here is reduced to nice thin envelopes<br /><br />so enjoy your whole mushrooms while you can, cause those are sent from areas that haven&#039;t been automated yet<br /><br />I also want to add that fear and ignorance is exactly what made psilocybe mushrooms illegal in the first place, and why I&#039;m stuck on the dark web and not on ebay where i should be with the morel hunters. If it was legal, then I could be insured and bonded and all that jazz and actually BE accountable under my real name, including periodic testing to ensure that it is in fact this accurate species<br /><br />think about THEM apples

It&#039;s been done before where vendors add chemicals to shrooms to give it a bigger kick. Just because it&#039;s indoor grown does NOT mean it&#039;s automatically safer than wild picked ones<br /><br />Well shit. looks like I&#039;m going to have to spend time here and educate people

				This is true, but unlikley with mycology professors themselves. There actually is a sub field of mycology that deals exclusively with slime molds and I&#039;ve read about some adventurous students/professors sampling some of them and that is kind of dangerous as it is the most difficult part of mycology and requires microscopes and DNA mapping<br /><br />If a professor of mycology did get poisoned, and I still can&#039;t find a link for it, it&#039;s likely that the professor is already investigating very rare or emerging species which happens all the time. In other words, it&#039;s extremely unlikely a mycology professor is going to get poisoned confusing well established species<br /><br />You know the famous saying. there old mushroom hunters and there are bold mushroom hunters, but here are no old AND bold mushroom hunters<br /><br />and that&#039;s been true for a long time. Mycology is always updating and we&#039;ve only scratched the surface with naming species, but most of us are quite conservative and I for one stick to only 1 or 2 species and have mastered that<br /><br />If you master 1 or 2 species and stay with that, it&#039;ll never do you wrong<br /><br />In fact I know some of the top experts around here and some of them can name you 4000 species from memory..

You made no mention of this thread, nor of the fact that you were previously advised that it was human error and that DPR stated it should have been 8 days.

				This is a disgrace. A complete disgrace.<br /><br />The OP was not impolite whatsoever in his discussion post. Furthermore, the post was beneficial to the whole community; buyers and vendors alike benefit from his contribution, which is behavior that should be encouraged. Instead it was punished. This is a travesty and a complete disregard of our libertarian philosophy. Moreover, the staff involved and those responding in this thread are now attempting to spin the reality of the situation to rationalize their poor management of the situation. This is appalling behavior from those who have the responsibility of upholding the basic tenets of Silk Road and the philosophy on which it was founded. You would do yourself, and Silk Road, a service by acknowledging your fault in this incident, and rectifying the error graciously instead of attempting to justify your poor actions.<br /><br />This stinks of hubris, the abuse of power is evident to all and it&#039;s indeed a dark day for the entire community. Most notably the staff who I&#039;ve grown to respect and admire. Such a terrible shame.<br /><br />Thank you for bringing this to our attention, OP.

				While it was reasonable for the OP to at least ask if they could be sent whole, the vendor&#039;s response was sensible (and polite), and with the risks a vendor faces it&#039;s entirely understandable on the latter&#039;s part. Escalating things and getting adversarial (reflecting some sort of persecution complex) damages the community. If you don&#039;t trust a vendor then don&#039;t order. I won&#039;t get into the mycology aspect but trying to identify a specimen from a dried sample and believing you could do better than an experienced vendor who identified it when it was fresh? Please.

				Clearly a genuine misunderstanding on the rectal bleeding thing, but I think DaFuck needs to cool off, swallow his pride a bit and apologize for getting a hot headed over the matter. Aggressively demanding an apology from SR support is bordering on arrogant IMO, although I suppose SR support could say that they &quot;regret the inconvenience caused as a result of this genuine misunderstanding, and hope we can all move on&quot;, or something.<br /><br />The fact that the vendor won&#039;t ship what he wants is just tough luck. Vendor doesn&#039;t supply what you want - move on and look for another vendor.
