				I ordered something yesterday, and it&#039;s 10:15 PM now while still processing. The guy is very trusted on SR and on his feedback everybody is complimenting him on how fast he is(usually gets there in 2-3 days after purchase). Is there a chance that he has already shipped it even though it shows processing?

				Seriously? Anyway, it&#039;s a USPS holiday. Besides, a busy vendor, no matter how reputable, may not be able to get your shit to the post office until 48 hours after you order.

Normally things get marked as &#039;in transit&#039; for me pretty quickly. Don&#039;t sweat it though, it&#039;ll come I&#039;m sure.

				Some people don&#039;t deliver every day of the week. You do know they don&#039;t just go dropping off hundreds of packages at the post office? They have to drive all over the place to ensure your package gets to you. They really do work hard.

The seller is the one who marks it in transit after he ships it. I guess it&#039;s possible that he forgot?

Personally I prefer to deal with those that are one man operations so as to to get the proverbial I thought my helper was doing it so it is his fault.
