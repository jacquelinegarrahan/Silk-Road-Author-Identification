				Hi SR Forums.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found myself in quite a sticky situation recently, in which I put trust in a new vendor whom, I now know, is a total scam artist and did not deserve my trust. Basically, he was selling Australian cannabis at quite a fair price and made it extremely clear that he DID NOT require early finalization. This ticked all the right boxes for me, so I gave him a try. He promised NEXT DAY DELIVERY, which, due to the postal service, can VERY RARELY be extended to 3-4 day delivery. It has now been 6 business days since it was marked in transit and upon reading the feedback from many others who stupidly chose to finalize early, this vendor does NOT reply to any messages and along with this, no body else has had a package arrive, despite this next day delivery promise. My issue is that I will not be able to take this issue to the resolution centre for another few days, however I am leaving the country tomorrow and will not be able to get to the resolution centre before my order auto finalizes. What should I do? PS - This vendor has gone into some sort of stealth mode, in which I can not actually access his profile - I can only &#039;send message&#039; when i click on his name. FYI, the vendor is &#039;BrisbaneNextDay&#039;.<br /><br />TL;DR - New vendor scammed me. Will be unable to take this resolution centre due to not having access to country. What do I do in order to preserve my PERFECT statistics, without giving in to this scam artist.

				Hi there,<br /><br />Sorry to hear of your troubles. When you click a vendor&#039;s name and you are directed to a page where all you can do, is message them, it means that their seller privileges have been revoked; i.e. it was obvious that he was scamming and he got reported to SR admins. If I were you, I would write to SR admins and ask them to cancel your order on their side. Don&#039;t finalize the order, whatever you do!! Let them know that you won&#039;t be around when the option to go to &#039;resolution&#039; becomes available.<br /><br />If he has gone scammer, SR admins should be able to cancel the order and it won&#039;t effect your refund rate. ;)<br /><br />Hope this helps

				Pretty sure you can put it into resolution a few days b4 it finalizes.<br />Just click on it, and go extend resolution date by 10 days or howeverlong you need

				No worries at all ;)<br /><br />If you go to the bottom right hand side of the page when you are logged into the main SR site, there is a &#039;Support&#039; link. Click on that and there are a few options. Option number 4 is the one you are looking for. Use the vendor in question username as your subject in the message you send and hopefully you will get a quick response.<br />
