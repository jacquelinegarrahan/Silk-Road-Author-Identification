				So true, although I&#039;ve been on SR for less than a year I&#039;ve had substantial purchases and have dealt with my fair share of bad vendors so when I deal with a new Vendor that&#039;s top notch and exceeds my expectations they deserve that I leave a detailed and positive review. This whole system is pretty much based on reviews, feedbacks, and amount of transactions a vendor has. Good vendors should be acknowledged by taking the time to leave a informative and positive review if warranted.

				It&#039;s bad for the buyer and vendor if you don&#039;t update your feedback; the vendor misses out on feedback and the buyer has to sift through a bunch of meaningless feedback, which can also be interpreted as sketchy.&nbsp; I only recently did my first order and was asked to FE; it was a super small order and the vendor was well established so I didn&#039;t care at all.&nbsp; Wrote FE with trusted seller in the feedback, when it came, I updated the feedback.&nbsp; It&#039;s that simple, and I sort of view it as a responsibility to the vendor and other buyers.

				I always finalize the minute I receive my product.&nbsp; I leave feedback regarding stealth, shipping times, communication, etc. But the product doesn&#039;t always go down the hatch (or up the nose, or butt or anywhere else people put drugs) the minute I unwrap it.&nbsp; However I do always, with no exceptions, edit my feedback to reflect the quality once my order has been marquis tested (if applicable) and personally tested.<br /><br />I do agree there is no point in leaving feedback if its just FE (you don&#039;t have to, and shouldn&#039;t, leave feedback when you do FE as OP pointed out) and I do believe people should leave more detail in their feedback than the examples you listed.&nbsp; I wanna know more than just &quot;it showed up&quot; or &quot;smells like the real deal.&quot;&nbsp; If it showed up speak regarding the things you can judge at that time then note that you will edit once you get a chance to try it and follow through.<br /><br />I also think our rating system is totally fucked and I think most buyers agree with me.&nbsp; Leaving a 4/5 because the shipping wasn&#039;t very stealthy but the product still arrived and was of good quality should be acceptable.&nbsp; As it is right now you can&#039;t trust anyone without near perfect feedback and half the vendors will try to blackmail you if you don&#039;t give perfect feedback or won&#039;t sell to you again.&nbsp; Just because you took 5 days to ship it out doesn&#039;t mean I won&#039;t give you another chance if I do like the final product but my rating needs to be able to reflect that.&nbsp; Also anyone who has ever browsed Atlantis has probably noticed in the feedback area they don&#039;t name the buyer but give you some of his stats to help you judge his credibility, which would be nice on the road, but I suppose that&#039;s for another thread in a different sub-forum.

				Didn&#039;t know you could just leave it! Thanks for that. :)<br /><br />Completely agree though, feedback is a major part of what makes this market function and reading a bunch of &quot;FE&quot; and other completely lacking feedback is annoying when you are looking for good vendors with good product.<br /><br />Since I didn&#039;t know you could just wait to add feedback I&#039;ve been finalizing and putting up something short about shipping time, if the stealth was good or not (nothing descriptive), service and how the product looks/smells etc, then I update once I&#039;ve tried it. :)

				Haven&#039;t read thread yet , will update when read =)<br /><br /><br />No seriously though , o.p&#039;s totally&nbsp; right , were all part of a community here , and that means your feedback&nbsp; shouldn&#039;t be taken so lightly - it&#039;s to help us all make informed buying choices .<br /><br />&nbsp;It makes it so much harder for people to get an idea of what to expect from there chosen vendor and it&#039;s sure as hell shouldn&#039;t be used as an implied threat to the vendor - witch is often what this &quot; will update once tried &quot; shit often boils down to .

				More people need to update, I agree. =/ That&#039;s the whole point of the reviews... It solidifies the vendor&#039;s reputation, and outs the bad ones. <br /><br />There ARE some good reviewers though. I have seen them many times. I try to read as many of them as possible as well.

				Some vendors actually require 5/5 and feedback left (SuperTrips for one) when FE before they will ship.<br /><br />Other vendors will add you to the blacklist for changing your rating.&nbsp; Or even giving anything less than 5/5 for that matter.<br /><br />In general, the current system is skewed towards favoring the vendors and is getting progressively worse with all of the blacklisting and fear mongering.&nbsp; I have no faith in it at all anymore and utilize these forums for all research before any order.

				I rekon buyers should have ratings aswell as feedback in their profiles. <br /><br />Its bullshit when someone receives and order and takes 5 days extra to finalize.. or do what you mentioned above about fe then threatening to give feedback.&nbsp; If vendors could give out feedback about the buyers I&#039;m sure it would stop alot of them doing the crap they do.

				Viewing this through another lens, it can be seen as another layer of &#039;digital divide&#039; so to speak. The same way we who have the knowledge to access the road and navigate it, some of us here also utilize the forums. Most vendors I do business with have a review thread which is far more useful in judging their quality than the SR feedback system. While the feedback system is a great concept, many of the people on the road apparently do not care once they have their product enough to do the right thing and provide for the community. Those who do not utilize the forums to judge a vendor and only rely on the feedback system are at a disadvantage comparatively to those who do... <br /><br />While we are all on a different level than &#039;street buyers&#039;, those of us using forum reviews are separate from those who only use the feedback system.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />T4B

It&#039;s stages.. <br /><br />Stage one - Surf for the product you want<br /><br />Stage two - Narrow down to a few listings and verify the vendors on the forum <br /><br />Stage three - Pay for product and wait<br /><br />Stage four - Finalize when product is received<br /><br />Stage five - Leave feed back on SR AND the Forum for the vendor and the product! <br /><br />I think its great that some of you are using the system the way its meant too.. the sad part is that MOST people are not..

				LA Blue Girl, <br />Those feedbacks I believe to actually help the community. I want to know if people FE! If there are a weeks worth of FE&#039;s and no arrivals I will choose another vendor. Why? Because it looks like an FE scam. I want to see every detail as it paints me a better picture of the current situation a vendor is having.

				Definitely sucks to see all those, I have to assume most of them were happy if they didn&#039;t come back...<br /><br />I only FE&#039;d once, like a $13 order or something. Had a no show but by the time I could be sure about that my feedback was fucking buried. Still changed it but it was most likely pointless.

				Updating is the best way to go, but even then, usefulness is limited and much shouldn&#039;t be expected from it.<br /><br />When I get my package, I&#039;m going to comment on what I can comment on there and then - usually with a promise to provide product reviews *in the forums* if the vendor has a thread there. Why in the world would you want product reviews in twitter-length format on SR itself when you can go into whatever length you need in a forum thread? <br /><br />I&#039;ve bought products months ago that I haven&#039;t yet used. I should just... not provide feedback? If everybody did that, no one would know that people were getting their packages.

				I haven&#039;t read the whole thread, so sorry if I missed something, but here is my point of view about those &quot;crappy&quot; feedbacks...<br /><br />I see it like this: if somebody ordered something, and left a feedback like &quot;FE&quot;, or &quot;Will update later&quot;, and actually never updates that feedback, I assume that this customer was happy and had nothing to complain, it&#039;s just a simple 5/5.<br /><br />But you can be sure that if somebody gets scammed, or receives a shit product he isn&#039;t happy with, he will shout it out loud, as loud as he can. Wouldn&#039;t you go back and update your feedback to 1/5, and tell everybody how that vendor has scammed you? I&#039;m sure most people would.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I see this &quot;crappy&quot; feedback still as a positive sign, although I also wish people would update their feedbacks more often, just to give a little bit more details about the product etc.
