				Inspired by the meetingpoint discussion, as by the post &quot;your pgp keys here&quot; thread, I suppose we do the following:<br />I hope i can motivate nomand to help me with this :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. Send me a pm with your pubkey(s) and a short text on how you can be reached, like tormail or i2pmail.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2. Please sign the full pm text with your pubkey!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3. I will store this crude database in a truecryptcontainer and pm all participants with the secret to open it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4. A torrent will be created</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5. The truecrypt container gets distributed amongst participants by p2p and it will be dead easy to establish a meetingpoint where we can trust each other.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The probably most important things, especially for vendors, is to archive evidence of your customerfeedback, positive forum reviews, maybe your post count... THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE ENCRYPTED BEVORE YOU HAND IT THE OTHER PARTY, BEING ME :D AND IT HAS TO BE A TEXTFILE WHICH YOU OF COURSE ALSO SIGN AND ENCRYPT WITH YOUR PRIVATE KEY!<br />These files will be added to the container, you can just encrypt and sign and upload them .onion filehoster and tell me the link.<br /><br />Only instructions on how to contact you and your public key(s) MUST be in cleartext.<br /><br />AND DO NOR FORGET TO SIGN THE WHOLE PM!<br /><br />This way everybody is enabled to establish contacts and it enables seller to proof their legitimacy if they choose to decipher it. You may add screenshots, dumps this guy bought from me and has XYZ forum postings, anything you feel will help you to prove your legitmiacy easily as they can choose to whom these informations will be revealed.<br /><br />If there is a serious flaw in my logic, it must have been the benzos :) 6am here... gotta sleep.<br /><br />I&#039;ll will provide a practical example tomorrow :D<br />

				Basically would be a big collection of voluntarily submitted contact information + pgp keys. But it has one advantage. Everybody joining will be able to provide encrypted information and/or files, which will be stored along with the public keys. I for example will include screenshots of the feedback I received and a dump of my profile.

Trust me? I&#039;d like to have it. You want the master list? Cool. I know anarcho47 is in. That&#039;s 3 so far. Who else? SR is down, you go up. 2 days later your are down.<br />I am up then down. Where does it stop? Everyone gets a copy? How about only trusted vendors? What does that mean and how do I qualify? <br /><br />I UNDERSTAND&nbsp; but do not like the info already stored/ available. It&#039;s helpful and cool but damn. Where does it stop? I ask again. I don&#039;t keep ANY info about anyone any longer than necessary. NO records. Sometimes I even get rid of stuff early. Burn baby burn! Then stir the ash. Done! Don&#039;t keep records. It&#039;s in the SR contract. Everyone should reread it. Myself included. <br /><br />I really don&#039;t want people looking at my &quot;stats.&quot; Once people get to know me, they are hooked. I have what they want. I deliver discreetly, ANONYMOUSLY and quickly. SO DO A LOT OF OTHER VENDORS!! (tip-of-the-hat-to anarcho47, nomad bloodbath, jesakai, to name a quick few, always a pleasure) I don&#039;t care what there stats are! I trust them. AND the stats are FUCT anyway! The way it&#039;s all figured and weighed. Everyone knows it. &quot;Oh (100) is now a (98)!&quot;&nbsp; OR &quot;My (90) is now (88)! &quot;Ya, probably b/c of some dumbass who was impatient or had unreal expectations. That alone would not stop me from visiting them again.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2846.msg23899#msg23899">Quote from: anarcho47 on September 07, 2011, 04:07 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m thinking of this as more of a good way to retain your business history/customer base if SR is ever shut down and a mass migration is required.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I UNDERSTAND but I would prefer very limited records being kept. Say Name, 235 positive, 1 negative feedback/ experiences. Call it whatever. Maybe a ratio of some sort? And there products w/pics. I don&#039;t need to read all 230+ to know that person is legit. Besides I want people in the forums. Do their research and ask question. Let SR worry about mass migrations and such. I am confident that SR has a &quot;Plan B&quot; and probably a &quot;Plan C.&quot; That&#039;s as far as my trust currently goes. I did have to sign up. I don&#039;t want 15 mofos w/my info encrypted or not. We all found our way here and I am sure we all could find each other again. W/O the Yellow Pages, lol. <br /><br /><br />

				What happens if LE gets in and asks for keys to the castle? They get keys? Anyone who asks? Everyone could just start IM ing everyone. Just like now. Just this isn&#039;t encrypted. We (the community should twist peoples arms) should use pgp more often. People talk to much! Less info the better. YES I am paranoid. I do not like records being kept. Especially for an extended period of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;I love the SR community as a whole and only want the best for all its legitimate members. GO FUCK OFF LE!! You will never be a part of the community! FUCKERS!! I would rather error on the side of caution. Less info stored the better. Thanks :)

				One thing is to encrypt text with public key from someone else. But signing text with your own key can and will be considered as evidence who author really is. If LE find your key and signed incriminating text, you are screwed.<br />Its same as your signature. You can not control who will send you something encrypted with your public key. But signing should be avoided.<br />To all who using hush accounts - switch off signing message!<br />No, thank you, I will pass.

				I think the bigger issue for me is my name - Anarcho47.&nbsp; I want it to be recognized, and I want to be able to prove that it is in fact me still carrying it if there is ever a need to migrate elsewhere.&nbsp; Putting just my public key in there and maybe a screenshot of my bio on SR can prove that it is in fact me if anybody wants to do business in the future.&nbsp; I.e. you send me a message &quot;is this really you man?&quot; encrypted to my public key.<br /><br />If I can answer it, it&#039;s me.
