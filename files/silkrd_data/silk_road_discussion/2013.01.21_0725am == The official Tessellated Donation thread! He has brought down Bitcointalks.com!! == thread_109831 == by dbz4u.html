				All hail our new overlord Tessellated! He has currently brought down the bitcointalks.com website, the infamous spammers. As soon as Tessellated posts his btc address please send all donations there. Until then, Please direct them to his username on the main site, using the transfer to username function.<br /><br />Account&gt;send funds to another member<br /><br />EDIT: According to the wishes of the our star vendor tessellated, please direct donations to the avengers LSD fund. &quot;Just donate to the Avengers, they are doing a great job keep real LSD around and FAKE away.&quot; - Tessellated<br /><br />I however will still be donating personally to this vendor, and to anyone who appreciates what he has just done for this community, please either donate directly to tessellated or the avengers.<br /><br />Thank you all<br /><br />Edit 2: Because of my personal appreciation for the relief you have potentially granted this community, a gift of .1 btc is coming your way tessellated. Enjoy<br /><br />Edit 3: <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=109831.msg748167#msg748167">Quote from: Tessellated on January 21, 2013, 07:35 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To quote what I said earlier:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=109654.msg748153#msg748153">Quote from: Tessellated on January 21, 2013, 07:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If ya guys wants something like this ran 24/7 I would need a pre-paid credit card number to set up a remote server and I would need someone to help me with the phone-back verification.

				The attack must be running continually or the site will come right back. I figure $30 a month would cover a dedicated attack server.<br /><br />If you just want to say thanks send to the Avengers.<br /><br />If you want to sponsor further disruption of the enemy then send the funds to me. I will put them to the proper use.

				Ok but how can I be sure he did this and did so single handedly? I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a way to prove that kind of thing besides bitcointalks.com&#039;s shit not being here but I&#039;m interested in more info like how he did it or something.

				Thank you new members, i know you of all people can appreciate the value of what Tessellated is doing. If you are really appreciative please do 2 things.<br /><br />1. PM the mods and ask that this thread be stickied. I consider this imperative, Tessellated is the only one to step up to the plate to defend our forums by taking the fight to them, and he should be acknowledged as such forum wide.<br /><br />2. If you have the spare btc, please consider donating to him or the other wonderful vendors in the LSD avengers thread. These people are the true heroes of Silk Road(Tessellated of course included), and Tess himself has given his blessing to donating to that.<br /><br />Make your voices heard members, show how grateful we can be as a community

				Frankly, the major limiting factor as far as I can see is that any serious, very difficult to defend against attack can&#039;t be performed effectively over Tor.&nbsp; Even if the network handled the kind of bandwidth it would require flawlessly, the nature of Tor makes it trivial to completely negate the attack.&nbsp; Again, I don&#039;t want to explicitly tell them how to get back up immune to this ever working again, but it&#039;s public knowledge basically.&nbsp; As in they&#039;ll find it if they aren&#039;t retards and they really do make money this way (which apparently they make a fucking ton of it like this, because they just keep coming back time and time again...)<br /><br />I do appreciate the caution you&#039;re showing, Scout, and I think that&#039;s very important for someone making decisions.&nbsp; But they&#039;re deliberately cheapening SR, the forums, and therefore by extension the users, proprietors, and name.&nbsp; Their spam has gone beyond simple spam and entered a level of repetition and constancy that makes it an attack in its own right.&nbsp; They seem to have no point at which &quot;it&#039;s gone too far,&quot; they will ruin SR if it keeps them pulling in cash.<br /><br />There is no one else to defend against this sort of thing, because it&#039;s Tor.&nbsp; There can&#039;t be anyone else, or we&#039;d all be locked up along with the fucking spammers.&nbsp; It must be us, and it must be effective.&nbsp; Negotiating seems unlikely to work.&nbsp; For these reasons, I personally say crippling them is not only justified but a necessity -- they&#039;ll eventually bring SR&#039;s image down into the sewers, and undermine everything DPR and SR stand for.&nbsp; This is not an unprovoked retribution.&nbsp; This is a purely defensive strategy.

This means my one system can only make them slow it cannot shut them down anymore. <br /><br />We need volunteers to run this command:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">torify ./slowloris.pl -dns bitcointalks.com -port 80 -num 500</code><br />You can get the tool here: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/<br /><br />Unless I start renting servers in the cloud I can&#039;t keep this up from my pathetice little laptop.

				I sent you my meager funds in my bitcoin wallet. More on its way soon.<br /><br />I think retaliation against bitcointalks/virwex is the only way to prove to spammers that we mean business.<br /><br />I am prepared to put money up for this. Others are also prepared.<br /><br />I am asking for volunteers, right now, to send 0.5 bitcoins to 1Fx73gWkLBS99YWmvbS6vYvfL7ykcbroSg with the description DDOS. This goes to Tessellated, not to me.<br /><br />6 users sending funds keeps this attack going on for more than one month. 60 users sending money annihilates the spammers for one year. Think about this - they have been laughing at us. Now we laugh at them.

				I put my money where my mouth is. 5 minutes ago, as Tessellated can confirm, I sent 0.5 bitcoins to 1Fx73gWkLBS99YWmvbS6vYvfL7ykcbroSg<br /><br />If you have given money for starving African children, give now again for this very important cause. If we act now, we will represent user resistance against scamming and spamming. It will be a seminal moment on the internet. Don&#039;t let them fuck us. Lets fuck them.

And also the other tech-heads I have seen on this Security dept. of SR forums that, on a daily basis, put everyone else I have seen on so-called IT security tech-support forums to shame. (There&#039;s a lot of members here that I initially overlook and then I go through their posts and am quickly corrected on the breadth/depth (tick which applicable :) ) RE security.... something most IT jackasses have no idea or even INT in. I respect an IT degree but not quite as much if this person does not know what the average Tor nerd on Silk Road forums does about security. Good lord man, if they have completed a degree this should be their forte! Or at least, they should be a little more ↑ with today&#039;s increased challenges. This is partly not their fault. It seems IT degrees might neglect how to safely browse the internet on Tor, they might cover it, I am unaware of it, I am guessing professors don&#039;t load ↑ Silk Road slides in lectures and teach the class how to safely browse the black-market and buy drugs anonymously, what do you expect. ??? )<br /><br />More than a couple new members have commented on the depth of knowledge by Silk Road members, and that this is taken as standard, not the exception. It would be curious to see what people currently working in the industry REALLY know about internet security/anonymity if put to the test..... in my view they are (least the ones I&#039;ve seen) misplaced in their view, or even their phucking understanding, of Tor. Most advise us to stay away and then let slip they haven&#039;t even been there themselves.<br /><br />That&#039;s wonderful. <br /><br />God, there must be a way to let employers know of your expertise without mentioning SR or Tor; TBH I resent the fact that some IT support operators look their noses thinking they &quot;know the shit, mahn!&quot; and haven&#039;t even been on Tor. ??? Why are they even there. Anyway that&#039;s ᴐ 2 ฿ on the matter. But yes, IMAHO, you guys should have these jobs and be paid an amount to reflect that, not people who are content to allow customers to be left vulnerable b/c they don&#039;t see security as the priority it should be.<br /><br />Was going to pick a quote from second paragraph but can&#039;t really choose b/c the whole bloody thing I soundly agree on; except I didn&#039;t follow the 1st sentence entirely which testifies my newness on Tor... I would have thought DoS to be carried out on Tor, not clearnet. But seriously, I&#039;m not a big fan of bending over and taking it.... if SR did not do anything it&#039;d become a bit of a joke. Rocket launchers and C4 need not be used (although good for a laugh :D )..... I don&#039;t see why we should not ↲ the favour to this Virwex or bitcointalks.com or whatever the phuc it is.<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m tired. Anyone who knows me knows I&#039;m ALWAYS tired. It&#039;s this bloody Tor thing. It&#039;s not quick enough and it strains my eyes and I get tired. Grr. &gt;:( <br /><br />Have no idea how to carry out a DoS so won&#039;t bother putting ᴐ hand ↑. Going to read what I missed on this thread to see if it has more info on this (read most of it). But yeah, good on you for having a spyne, so long as you don&#039;t get too high-profile, and GL to Tesselated and anyone else involved in this.<br /><br />Piece out. Nuke safely. :D Eat plenty.

				on one hand, i think the people who are careless or ignorant enough to be scammed by an obvious scammer deserves it. there are so many red flags. 10 btc when market value is at $17? i don&#039;t think so. and buying some coins, you should obviously do some research on your vendor. if you are dumb enough to be cheated like that, you kind of deserve it.<br /><br />but then on another hand, i don&#039;t like the fact that there are people preying on the stupids of this community; just because you can do it doesn&#039;t make it right. <br /><br />ultimately, if people keep getting scammed.. it would devalue BTC&#039;s. so i&#039;m not totally against doxing an asshole.

If someone is thrown into prison for selling or buying drugs, he is a victim of aggression, not the aggressor. Murderers and thieves are always aggressors, because they leave behind victims that did not desire that type of contact with them. Perhaps you should revise your &quot;Voice of Logic &amp; Reason&quot; byline.
