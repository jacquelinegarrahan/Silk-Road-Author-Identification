				Every detail you want to know is in this file. Such as the admin&#039;s were paid $1,000 to $2000 a week. Scary information to say the least. <br /><br />Crazy how shit hits the fan like this.<br /><br />In short, they found the servers silk road was ran on and they know everything. Every message. Every purchase.<br /><br />Stay safe fellow roaders, let DPR be the only arrest made. Farewell.<br /><br />Edit: I see 8 people, i&#039;m assuming vendors, have been arrested so far. They have anything unencrypted so guys be careful.<br /><br />*CLEARNET*<br />http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~nweaver/UlbrichtCriminalComplaint.pdf

				I did, about a week ago. First thing I did. Boring as fuck, with all the legalese and insisting on referring to Ross as &quot;Ross William Ulbicht, aka &#039;DPR&#039; aka &#039;Dread Pirate Roberts&#039; aka.... yadda yadda&quot; at the start of practically every paragraph. Would be nice if someone could OCR that and then remove all the crap, leaving the salient points - it&#039;d be half the length!<br /><br />Anyhow, it was a little hopeful too, since practically every method they used was &#039;classical&#039; detective work; PGP still works, TOR still works, Ross was just a bit of a dumbass who posted under his IRL gmail and used a VPN instead of TOR. There is a bot of a question mark over how they located the server, as well as the FH/tormail server (possibly the same server?). Some people have mentioned something about a bit of an &#039;IP leak&#039; at one point. Another idea is that the DDoS attack earlier in the year was some kind of correlation exercise to pinpoint the location somehow. I would LOVE to know how they did it....

				Yes that would be very interesting to find out how they found his servers. They found all of them saying they were spread out through many different countries. <br /><br />I&#039;m just now getting around to reading the affidavit and this is the first times back on the forums since his arrest. I&#039;m in utter disbelief at how things go so smoothly then all of a sudden he fucks up left and right starting around may of 2013. its like he wanted to get caught. <br /><br />what about the forbes interview recently? didn&#039;t that nudge towards there being two DPRs? an original and then the new one? which one is in custody?
