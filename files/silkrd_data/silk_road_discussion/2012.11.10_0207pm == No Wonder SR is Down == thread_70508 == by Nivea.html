				When a small site has a hundrend thousand members, 2/3rds more from 2011. The program set up cant handle that many new users and members, SR isn`t built like Ebay. In future admissions should be regulated somehow, every other site I know of you need to be sortve screened, partners in pain (pip) the moderator screened new applicants. You had to know someone or be recommended for admission. The sheer amount of new users like teenagers and others making news will be SRs downfall eventually. Sorry but if your a 13 or so yrs old member caught by mother who then petitions the government as well as certain other countries politicians, this site needs to be regulated IMO.

				I&#039;m starting to wonder, is DRP not a Libertarian at all but instead some Nazi thief who&#039;s fucked off with our money? It&#039;s a devastating thought and we know how hard they try to prevent scammers, but would they do i to us instead???

				I agree, some serious screening needs to occur. People should have to submit references etc to get a new account and even some n00bs should have theirs revoked until further notice. That&#039;s if we ever get the Road back again!

				It not open for everyone when it&#039;s inaccessible to everyone. To insure access to the max number of users possible, limits have to be imposed. If DPR wants it differently, then he and the SR team should have planned to grow, and been prepared to grow with no limits.

				You need to calm down, SR has been down for longer before and will be back at some point. Obviously it is annoying but we are all in the same boat here, at least you are not a vendor. With margins so tight and the fees imposed on vendors I feel for them.<br /><br />You just got really unlucky the first time you tried, be glad you got to register at all though.

				Mate, imagine how I feel, I just loaded 150 BTC into my account today on top of what I had not knowing about any of this until after the fact. I can see by my wallet it&#039;s in my SR account now, I just can&#039;t access it. It&#039;s very strange and TBH I&#039;m starting to think we&#039;ve all been had.

				There is always a good reason to tamp down on freedom, especially if it is for others.&nbsp; If we go down that road by screened registrations or kicking newer members of SR who knows where it will end.&nbsp; You have asked the people running the site to act immorally, plain and simple, and it is only a matter of time before they act that way towards you.&nbsp; If you want to regulate who buys and sells drugs somewhere open a business in your home.&nbsp; With all that being said we are not sure what is actually affecting the site is actually a result of too many members attempting to access it.&nbsp; That may not even be close to the situation...

				well put^. never rely on a place like this for something needed to get you through a day. at the very least get some local numbers to buy off of in case of emergency. better yet, don&#039;t get physically addicted to shit. It&#039;s easy for me to say because I&#039;m on suboxone and that&#039;s as simple as showing up at a doctors appointment and then going to the pharmacy, but even before that I knew how to find heroin or pills, even if it required walking into some of the filthiest most dangerous enclaves of society with a wad of cash in my pocket.
