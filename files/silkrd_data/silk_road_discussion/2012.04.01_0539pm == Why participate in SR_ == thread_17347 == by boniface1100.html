				I hope I dont sound like a whiner, but two weeks ago I found SR and got excited, wanted to be cautious so I decided to but one bag of H domestically to check quantity, already being aware that the quality would have to be particularly good to justify the expense and risk. So, after some misunderstanding in buying the btc (bitcoinme charged @6$ a coin), I ordered one bag from Agent Mulder, to check the situation out. Evidently I got burned. Yes, I read the reviews but it did not occur to me until too late that they all said they were fe&#039;ing early and noone mentioned arrival. Also, there was some prior history of successful sales.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, after two weeks now of trying to make the most minimal of requirements work (only one gethigh), it has all come to nothing. Even if I decided to try again, there are no domestic H dealers listed now. Noriega looks good, but getting a package from the Netherlands seems like a vastly greater risk than a domestic package.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I think I need to think rationally and not do SR. I have to decieve myself a bit to think that prices are competitive, and the risks and hassle, in the clear light of day are mounting up to a prohibitive level.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One more thing- the tone of discourse and dialog on the forums is pretty nasty- I expect some responses to engage in personal attacks- the normal aspersions on masculinity/maturity/intelligence- and this reminds me that SR is just a community of drug users, and is a long way from being reliable merchants. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What good reason is there to use SR? I can get ripped off quicker and with less hassle on my own. In my initial fantasy, SR was going to become my new safe source. Now it is just a distraction and disappointment.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Parenthetically- tar around here is @25 a gram- compare to Afghan at @250. Quality may be different, but thats a lot of money.

				Normally there are a few domestic H vendors that a VERY reliable... everyone has to take a break from time to time so I would just wait and see what pops up. SR can be a VERY reliable source if used correctly but obviously there are some scam sellers and vendors alike so all transactions should be entered into with caution.<br /><br />I hate that your experience has been not so good so far but I can tell you there are far more good transactions occurring&nbsp; every minute of every day than there are bad ones...<br /><br />I wish you luck and I do hope you find a resource who treats you well.<br /><br />Take care,<br />TJ

				The key to success on SR as a buyer is at a minimum, stay within escrow. If the vendor requires early finalization, move on. If there&#039;s no vendor for your drug of choice that doesn&#039;t use escrow for new buyers, you can...<br /><br />1. You can take a chance. But make sure it&#039;s money you wouldn&#039;t mind flushing down the toilet. <br />2. Go buy other drugs that might interest you&nbsp; from sellers that use escrow with new buyers so you can build up a buyer history. (AKA you won&#039;t be a noob no mo&#039;). Then go back to the seller who sells your drug of choice and go through escrow. <br /><br />From my point of view, there&#039;s never really a good reason to go outside escrow. Perhaps if you are doing a special order with a vendor you trust because you have been dealing with them for a while. But other than that, I wouldn&#039;t and haven&#039;t. <br /><br />I have had 100% success on SR buying from a number of vendors. <br />

				I also got ripped off by agent Mulder(scanner) but he has been the only one out of 12 transactions that has scammed me. What an idiot though. Why rip people off when u can make a shitload being a reputable vendor. Mulder your a dirtbag.

				Certainly it&#039;s your choice not to use SR anymore if you had a bad experience, but I wouldn&#039;t rush judgement, because I think you made a couple obvious mistakes (admittedly, correct?) and made some not-so-obvious ones as well.<br /><br />I emailed my sellers for a week before deciding on a purchase. I asked questions on how SR worked, what to expect, and I asked about the quality of their product. Based on their answers, it was easy to determine who would be the best. If the sellers didn&#039;t answer at all, they didn&#039;t make the cut. If the seller&#039;s answers were too short or if they didn&#039;t answer the question that I was asking, they got demoted on the list. If the seller&#039;s answers were completely dodgy or if their answers insulted my intelligence, they got cut.<br /><br />The seller that impressed me the most answered all my questions honestly, and gave good explanations on what to expect. The good sellers did not suggest breaking SR rules, and the best seller refused to do it. <br /><br />Obviously, you shouldn&#039;t finalize early on your first order. Finalizing early is designed for those sellers who you have built a reputation of trust with, and even then finalizing early should be done very rarely, if ever.<br /><br />Also, reading the feedback should have been a no brainer. Even feedback doesn&#039;t even help that much, because as we have seen, it can be easily fabricated. <br /><br />But, maybe the Silk Road and you just weren&#039;t meant to be. I think that the SR works best for those who conduct their business with a degree of caution and skepticism, and don&#039;t expect to just blindly send money to someone and have something arrive with no hoops to jump through. This obviously doesn&#039;t describe you.

				I started a couple weeks ago and FE&#039;d with a reputable vendor, because I know the risk for the seller if I decide to claim the product didn&#039;t show up. After getting this rep, I continued to buy in escrow and have had 2 (almost 3) successful transactions.<br /><br />You were just unlucky to have had to deal with a deceiving asshole vendor as your first purchase. I would say&nbsp; SR is far better than getting anything off the street for many reasons. A new dealer could do the same in person, and violence could erupt instead of a simple failure to deliver.<br /><br />I would say try some of the &quot;power&quot; sellers here, establish a good rep, then work in escrow with anyone mildly suspicious.<br /><br />One of these days I may be victimized, but I already know that almost always, I will get my shipment (especially domestic). Practice caution and eventually you will be very happy you turned onto the Road.

				Thank you all for your comments, even you, kidx. These are good points, and delivered, for the most part, in a civil and respectful manner. I will maybe try again.<br />The quality of these comments is encouraging, because some of these other threads contin comments that one would never say to the other persons face. That has scared mr a little bit, because I do not consider us to be members of a sociaally elite or superior group, but, on the other hand, I do not like the proposition to be disproved so conclusively. So yes, kidx, maybe I am an SR person after all- but I wont be listing that on any sort of resume, or my facebook page. I am not ashamed of it, but not necessarily proud, either.

One vendor refunded 65% no questions asked, the other has not responded to PMs.<br /><br />Hard lesson to learn, but I&#039;m comfortable using SR now and have had nothing but sweet sweet success when staying within escrow.<br /><br />Long live the road :)

				Herp, I can&#039;t help but notice that you said &quot;everyone else was doing it&quot; about early finalization for a listing... It didn&#039;t happen to be AgentMulder, was it? He seems like he very successfully got many people to finalize early via PMing and asking them to FE for a discount. Always make sure to check for recent successful feedback to ensure the seller can be trusted.
