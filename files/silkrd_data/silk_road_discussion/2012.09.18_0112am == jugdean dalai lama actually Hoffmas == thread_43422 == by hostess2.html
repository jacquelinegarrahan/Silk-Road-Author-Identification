				I don&#039;t have any real information to give you, except to say that acid slingers never know what kind of mic they have. How do you measure in MICROGRAMS??? 300ug is extremely high for a tab... I have read that most tabs are laid at about 60 - 100, so I would be very surprised. All I can say is you should take one and let us know how it goes. If the walls melt away, maybe it is 300ug after all.

				Well that is what jugeran has advertised. I have ordered from him before and received what he was selling this is the time he has done this, there is a lot of people complaining bc it cost $100.00 for 5 tabs. yes it is very pricey but its the best cid on the road. He should of changed the post as soon as he gets different blotter, at least post sump about the product being different than advertised. that&#039;s garbage i feel&nbsp; like i got scamed.

				that price makes me very sad, the hoffmans are usually around 65ug, the dalais are a very high end print and are around 125ug. i guess if people want to believe that they&#039;re paying plentiful prices for a purportedly premium product, it&#039;ll have a placebo effect on them<br /><br />or as jannis (who&#039;s also awesome! :P) put it<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30904.msg420419#msg420419">Quote from: Jannis on August 20, 2012, 10:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Commercial prints are never in the upper 100ugs. Vendors advertise it as such but it is a pile of crap. The only widely distributed prints in Europe in those ranges were the Fat Freddies, Mayan Calenders and Dalai Lamas. And none of them you would be able to score under 10USD for personal amounts. If you are buying semi-bulk and bulk then yes, it is possible. Being honest on acid dosages feels like fighting wind mills. Sometimes it strikes be that people want to be lied to, if somebody tells them they are getting 10x200ug hits for 140 bucks (like with ST) they want to believe it. Of course it is bullocks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

(Summer) 2008 Dalai lamas reached the end user at around 125ug too.

				relating to your other question, i have promethazine (25 mg) and several others on here do as well, but i dont really understand why people want to take it recreationally? <br /><br />i have it for upset stomaches. it knocks me the fuck out too, and not in an enjoyable way. when you hear about rappers drinking &quot;prometazine&quot; the real goodies in their purple drank is codeine, an opiate analgesic. promethazine potentiates it i suppose, but its a shitty potentiatior and too much will just make you fall asleep. i suggest ordering cocodamal from someone on here and CWE the codeine out

				He mentioned on his page that (a) he ran out of the dalai lama prints and is using a different one, but the ARE the same quality, and (b) that he dropped some extra cid on each hit due to complaints. He blamed the hot weather for complaints. He has also earlier talked about getting new crystal in.<br /><br />All this leads me to believe that he is laying his own blotter, so people&#039;s claims about commercial prints floating around Europe have nothing to do with what juergen is selling.<br /><br />I bought the 5 &quot;dalai lama&quot; prints a couple of weeks ago, and also got Hoffmans instead. I have been too busy since then to try them properly, but I did eat ~1/3 of a hit as soon as I got them. (A bit less, actually.) After about an hour, I was clearly tripping, and 2 hours in I was fully tripping, complete with fractals, closed-eye visuals, a complete mindfuck, etc. Obviously it&#039;s hard to gauge acid potency just by feeling, but I&#039;d be very surprised if I had done less than 75-80mcg. So, I&#039;ll vouch that they are over 200mcg, probably over 250 even.<br />
