DPR, although it&#039;s not nice to be in prison, i really do not appreciate the following things:<br />- Claming ultra unbeatable security, we will never get caught bla bla while making such an amateur mistakes!<br />- Making NO back up plans for millions worth of BTC, including 250k USD of mine. How can you be such a clown? If you are making millions then at least goddamnit make a back up plan that if you get busted, at least not everyone on here does to !<br />- 4% commission fees for all this?? <br /><br />I suspect his passwords were seized because he was arrested while his computer was on, or they used a cold-boot attack (freezing RAM to retrieve truecrypt keys). If you, DPR, have been arrested without any passwords readable, and you gave them out, then you are a big RAT and deserve to die with a RAT in your mouth like we do in Italy !!!<br /><br />I hope you are the only one having to pay up for your foolish mistakes (speaking of freedom, because financially you already made a lot of others pay up!!) and you won&#039;t take dozens of other people down with you !! <br /><br />People who have ordered with real addresses in plain view, watch out folks, possibly the DEA will have a &#039;knock&#039; on those doors. Customers out of the USA, i would not worry too much.<br /><br /><br />DPR in his online interview, didn&#039;t want to reveal from which country he was )oh what safe you are being !!), but hey, he posts with his real name about SR in public forums, and a ton of real life people know of him running SR? You could as well have just said your real name and address in the interview, that way at least we had some time to retrieve our bitcoins !<br /><br />And lastly, i am REALLY pissed off at you DPR for having me temporaly banned for doing some small out of escrow deals, and then threatening me to ban me forever if i did it again. Thanks DPR for forcing me to keep all my bitcoins into your so safe and good escrow.. Oh wait.. They are not my bitcoins anymore, thanks !<br />

				I don&#039;t mean to be a prick at a time like this, but hushmail has been no good for years. Has shut down numerous accounts over alleged shady activities. Safe-mail is better.

We will eventually think about something else, but for now hushmail is good. We use only encrypted talk anyways (privnote and PGP) so i don&#039;t see the problem.<br /><br />Safe-mail is ran by the Mossad, search on Google !<br /><br />

				PGP can keep communication even in gmail from being read. Should be used with any service I wouldn&#039;t trust anyone 100%. goes without saying I hope for everybody at this point.<br /><br />It happened to me and others though, hushmail shut down accounts because they peeked in and saw suspicious activity, only reason I bring it up. Best of luck to everybody...

				It would be more secure if we send you a message in PGP encryption with our Public key, and you reply us back in another email which hasn&#039;t been shared on the forums. That way the only people who know your email, are your customers. I&#039;m afraid it is only a matter of time they will look into your italianmafiabrussels@hushmail.com account which we all know by now, and find your IP. This would only work if you trust your customers are not LE :-(<br /><br />

				Excuse my ignorance but can I use my safe-mail account to email a hushmail account?&nbsp; I&#039;m going to be using PGP regardless but just want to know if that&#039;s possible.

				Thanks.<br />I will email you with due time.<br />I&#039;m only a small vendor and lost $12K, which happens to be everything I have spare at the moment.<br />So Dingo is fucked for now, but this will only make me more determined to make money from drugs.<br />It&#039;s been problem after problem after problem for me this year. :(<br /><br />That is a huge loss and I&#039;m sorry for it!<br /><br />I am still not 100% sure how Silk Road can disappear with ALL the money can happen.<br />Something seems not right to me. We will see with due time anyway.<br /><br />I also think there will be a lot more FE required in the future on other sites.<br />A lot of people have lost a lot of money and they will not trust escrow after this.<br />Hopefully a site even better than Silk Road will eventuate and it will NEVER be taken down&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Wish you luck in the future anyway!
