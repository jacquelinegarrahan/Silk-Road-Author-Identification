				So I ordered some DMT from sexualhealing 7 days ago, he said he was going to post it today or tomorrow, haven&#039;t heard any confirmation of that but that&#039;s kind of irrelevant. Anyway the orders(x) section up the top said orders(1) when it was processing, and now it says orders(0) and there is nothing in there. Does this mean he has posted it and the system purged all information of it automatically, or what? Sorry, my first purchase on SR and I&#039;m a tad nervous.<br /><br />~ Laby420

				No, it doesn&#039;t get sent to gox...if it doesn&#039;t show in your account...u know, go from being in escrow back in to main, then I&quot;d contact SR over there...I&quot;m sure it&#039;s something simple.&nbsp; But you&#039;re the only one can finalize, and the only time I&#039;ve seen that very thing, is when seller canceled order, and btc were returned to my account.&nbsp; So I&quot;d contact SR, over on main forum, let them know what happened...

				What is finalizing? And no, the money isn&#039;t in escrow, it was withdrawn as I said. I didn&#039;t withdraw it though, somebody (or something) else did.

				Is your password the same for Mt Gox as SR?&nbsp; Maybe someone hacked your account after the transaction was cancelled.

				I would bet 10 BTC your SR login and password is the same as Mt. Gox and your account and password were one of the accounts that were hacked a couple weeks ago and someone came on SR and canceled your order and took your money.

				Could you have hit the finalize button? ask the vendor if the btc&#039;s were released to him.

				That two withdraw transaction are strange!<br />Think vendor did cancel an order as you see refund.<br />One min after - withdraw (why 2 if somebody hacked account).<br />

				Yeah: something weird going on with finalize and orders disappearing...my just-slightly-paranoid brain thinks it&#039;s the LE takeover and the resident LE geek is out sick, or doing dope, or whatever it is they do on their well-paid off time...
