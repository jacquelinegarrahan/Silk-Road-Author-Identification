				Anyone?&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to wait 2 or 3 days.&nbsp; Is there a way to get instant Bitcoins?&nbsp; Or if not instant, quickly?<br /><br />Would it be going to Chase or Wells Fargo with cash?&nbsp; And how would you get your bitcoins in your wallet?

				Yes: best way now, as others have stated, is with get-bitcoin.com&nbsp; Go to their site, and click on the &#039;buy&#039; button...you&#039;ll need an email addy and a &#039;name;... they will then email you the transaction# and account# for get-bitcoin.<br /><br />Trot down to closest Wells Fargo branch with the amount of cash stipulated, fill out deposit slip with info they gave you, give to teller, get receipt.&nbsp; No i.d. required.<br /><br />Get home, take picture of receipt, and send email with this receipt pic to get-bitcoin.&nbsp; <br /><br />btc will be in your account within the hour.<br /><br />btw, they didn&#039;t ask for pic, I just sent it, so there wouldn&#039;t be delays, and they seemed to like that...<br /><br />Any problems, they do respond to email.

				Yea, fastest way right now would be Get-Bitcoin Wells-Fargo deposit. I made the mistake of not reading the site thoroughly and thought the only method available to me was Dwolla and I deposited money last Thursday and it&#039;s STILL fucking pending. Def. not gonna get my stuff in time for Halloween. Ah well.

				I wish there were a Well&#039;s Fargo within a hundred miles of where I live :/<br /><br />In any case, I&#039;m looking forward to when they implement instant MoneyPak confirmations. I&#039;ll try a small one, and if it goes through, G-B will certainly be my provider of choice in the future.

Both have delays in converting btc to cash (not something I have to deal with, unfortunately). I guess the biggest benefit I see to getbitcoin is that they take moneypak deposits (or used to and probably will again pretty soon) and wells-fargo deposits, so converting cash to btc is faster.<br /><br />i think if i&#039;m trading bitcoins then mtgox makes sense. if i&#039;m just buying bitcoins then get-bitcoin makes sense - they&#039;re faster. <br /><br />but it looks like going the dwolla to mtgox to btc route is cheaper. dwolla costs 0.25 regardless of the size of the transfer and mtgox charges 0.6% on a trade, not 5% like gbc. so on a $500 transfer the cost is $3.25 vs $25.00.<br /><br />right now gbc about 2.69/btc while mg is 2.77/btc so at the moment they are cheaper. i don&#039;t understand why there is such a difference between the two.

				Yep: none of them are perfect, and it&#039;s such a fast-changing market, and the exchanges are always having problems, either getting ripped, or fuck, the paranoid think it&#039;s them doing the ripping...and the options all have drawbacks: dwolla is slow, and gets way too much info about us...get-bitcoin.com is fast and handy, but unlike the defunct exchangebitcoin, u don&#039;t have an account there, so u have to xchange btc at the going rate...that&#039;s a real drawback if u want a fast way to make the xchange, but *not* have too many btc sitting around...they could take another dive tomorrow...<br /><br />But using the &#039;older&#039; exchanges like mtgox and tradehill have the drawbacks of getting dollars to them...dwolla just sucks...and a week ago, tradehill was shut down because bitinstant was shut down...and all of them act like they could go under at any moment, or get shut down, or owners run off with money...fuck, depends on how paranoid I get, which one I use...and I *like* instawallet.org for tumbling, but I like it even for *stashing* and lately tend to want to bypass wallet.dat mine altogether...<br /><br />I suggest to any newbie that u sign up and read and participate on bitcointalk.org&nbsp; I learned when we were down the first time, that this is a good area to learn what is going on with btc.&nbsp; And all the exchanges post there, and have threads about them there...don&#039;t tell everybody u are from SR tho, ha ha...most of them kind of dislike us, say we are besmirching btc&#039;s good name....LOL, I think we keep the fucking currency alive myself, probably the only ones who use it as a serious coin....

				+1 on what phubaiblues said.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been spending a lot of time on bitcointalk.org lately and am starting to get into the mining side as well.&nbsp; ExchB was the bomb, but Get-Bitcoin is rather nice as well for some quick BTC retrieval.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another method that is somewhat sketchy as it involves PayPal is using virwox.&nbsp; That site sells linden (virtual currency used in 2nd life) for USD through paypal.&nbsp; Once you purchase your linden you can then buy BTC with that linden as they also do currency exchange with btc and other currencies as well.&nbsp; You can make payment with PayPal for the linden then trade your linden for bit-coins in a matter of an hour.&nbsp; The bit-coins are received instantly and you can withdraw them to any address you like.&nbsp; The first withdraw can take up to 48 hours but after that they are all instant.

				My get-bitcoin.com went very smooth.&nbsp; Did it just like ExchB, except it seemed even easier.&nbsp; Like others submitted for cash (ran TOR for the website), provided a coin addy running under tor), gave a tor email, made the deposit of cash, sent a scrubbed pic of the deposit slip with tormail.&nbsp; Gladly paid the 5%, and received my coin in like 2 hours.&nbsp; I was worried they would screw me in the exchange, but actually got me the low bid for that particular time.
