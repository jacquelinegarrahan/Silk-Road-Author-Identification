				I see vendors like ivory charging 12BTC for MDMA, and then I see vendors like DrNyx charging 6BTC. <br /><br />Are vendors like ivory charging more because they cannot get the prices as cheap as vendors like DrNyx, or would it be because the MDMA is made with a higher quality synthesis etc? <br /><br />I dont understand why people would choose to pay 12 when they can get a G for 6? Will there really be a difference in terms of how high you get and the clean-ness of the drug if you compared them both? <br /><br />Has anyone expierenced both and&nbsp; give comparisons?<br /><br />

				$100,000 Ferarri or $50,000 BMW?<br /><br />You pay for the brand name and the quality of the manufacturer.<br /><br />Dank

				I don&#039;t think the comparison with cars is right here.<br /><br />Different sellers have different access to the same substance or are just doing less profit of selling here, doesn&#039;t mean the quality must differ.<br />Try it on your own. drNYX said he&#039;s breaking the prices of mdma, because &quot;he can&quot;, seems like he has some great contacts and he is sharing that price with the SR community. if you don&#039;t have any trusted vendor for mdma now, you could give him a try.<br />i prefer domestic vendor, even if the prices are higher compared with the foreign vendors, it&#039;s up to you :)

				Ivory sends his from the UK, which is a little safer than Netherlands. <br /><br />Some people will pay a premium to get their drugs to them with a bit less worry/stress for them while it is in transit.

				^ yup, i have tried all of the top mdma vendors and none of the product really stuck out over the others. they all have very good, pure mdma ( guessing 75-84% quality) but recently i got some MDA from montell williams and its the bomb! i like MDA more than mdma now&nbsp; ;D
