				its not that different <br /><br />only that you can save sites to your profile and leave comments<br /><br />i dont think i have any registration codes but they are mainly intended for people you know you can trust, because they can ruin your own score and get you in trouble if they fuck around

				Yes, I realize i can simply search the sites i find .. there are plenty of great threads here with a bunch of clearnet vendor list.. <br />i just want to BE IN.. i&#039;ll feel better about my manhood even. so this is quite important as you can imagine!

				i appreciate you at least did not offer to buy the code which is strictly against the rules.<br /><br />i think its fine to ask, so you may get lucky if someone has one available. i might check to see if i have any <br /><br />and its not like you get access to a list of sites, you still only can see the ones that you have specifically found yourself... just that once you enter them they are saved in your profile

				anyone who considers handing out SOS referrals to people on SR are fools.<br /><br />For one, SOS referrals are a privilege that comes with a certain amount of trust that you will only give one to someone you know very well, they are not to be traded or sold as the consequences of letting either LE or some fuckhead get one are huge.<br /><br />Anyone who considers either selling or trading referrals is a cunt and shouldnt be involved in the scene at all<br /><br />Also all referrals are traceable back to the referrer so if you give one to someone who turns out to be either LE or a dickhead your name will quickly spread around and you will lose all credibility.<br /><br />Also if you have to ask strangers on SR for a referral code your obviously either new to the scene or LE. Please earn your referral code by becoming more involved, joining other forums and the like.

SERIOUS, ah?<br />IT&#039;S ME ORNGECAPSULE. i AM actively and PASSIONATELY involved in our COMMUNITY.&nbsp; this is my fucking home now, i furiously refresh pages, check on posts all frenzied and shit, on new SR listings, lurk and post non-stop, and change TOR identities OBSESSIVELY when SR is FUCKED (not loading), probably 100+ times in 1 hour.&nbsp; i&#039;m devoted to this shit.<br /><br />so your post is TRULY fucked, and FOOLISH. how would you expect me to know that shit?<br /><br />i just recently started using RC .. mdpv .. smoked it .. and boom .. that&#039;s it! i&#039;m all about looking for the BEST MDPV or similar available whether it&#039;s on clearnet or SR. then i stumbled upon SOS just 2 days ago. it seems like a site that gives you the list of best vendors, according to their rating. by now after days of research i already THINK i know the best vendors for RC, by heavily browsing and lurking forums, etc..<br /><br />i had no idea about how SoS&#039;s actual referral system works, or that it leaves a &quot;trace&quot;. or the other security &quot;issues&quot; you&#039;ve mentioned in your OFFENSIVE post.&nbsp; how the fuck could i know all that? i assumed it was a simple code that could be PM&#039;d to me .. harmless, and simple, so i thought.<br /><br />serious negativity coming from you. what you&#039;re saying is not completely ILLOGICAL. i understand how you could see it that way. but the fact that you assraped this thread, LUBELESS with that cumfuckery is truly low, especially with the offensive bullshit, as opposed to educating someone new to the whole thing about the specifics regarding SOS.<br />you accomplished that, but in a rude, disrespectful way. <br /><br />in the future try to at least dig through a user&#039;s posts and threads, to &quot;feel&quot; them out or gather your opinion on THEIR intentions, character, forum vibe etc.. <br /><br />i don&#039;t need to explain this to you, but in REALITY my SR stats are immaculate. and my contribution to the forum, with detailed reviews of my &quot;experiences&quot;, my truly helpful guides to gratify and assist noobs, and my overall PROPER forum etiquette has always been appreciated, and RESPECTED. so i&#039;m slightly offended by your post.<br /><br />i stumbled upon SOS 2 DAYS AGO after researching and composing my guide for NOOBS, which btw could be a fascinating, interesting read for you: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=48714.0&nbsp; &nbsp;(possible TL:DR scenario)<br /><br />my desire to get into a private invite only site is quite STRONG. i think that&#039;s natural and legitimate within us all. just like i thoroughly and intensely hunted for those torrent private tracker sites back in the day.. same situation here.<br /><br />i would appreciate the referral. if it risks anyone&#039;s safety in any way .. then fuck it. <br /><br />i realize i can simply use the site by searching the links of vendors known to be of high quality. (happyC, astro, etc) <br />what i&#039;d like to do is also contribute and submit reviews. but mainly to see everything cataloged neatly in a database listed by rating / score of course .. so i can decide which vendor i would theoretically go with (and trust with my $) IF for example i were to maybe place my first RC order outside of SR.<br /><br />and regarding the LE shit. bleh. fuck that, ok? i&#039;m outside usa so your LE doesn&#039;t apply at all to me.<br /><br />but i will admit&nbsp; and EMPHASIZE once again, your overall point and message beyond the rudeness is 100% CORRECT! <br />don&#039;t trust anyone .. LE piglets and all kinds of reporters are definitely on these boards fishing for &quot;material&quot;. obvious shit we all know.

				no offense to the OP meant.<br /><br />SR is a NEW community with members that generally dont know each other from a bar of shit apart from here on SR.<br /><br />SR is actively looked at by LE and Id go so far as to say that theres members on here that are LE and blend in very well, participating in conversations, befriending people, starting threads and are probably indistinguishable from genuine members.<br /><br />SOS referrals are traceable to whoever gave them out and also gives whoever has one access to a myriad information. I know you can access SOS without a referral but it still offers LE a way of gaining trust from others and another way to join some dots.<br /><br />This scene used to be about trust and by handing out SOS referrals you are just breaking down barriers&nbsp; put in place over years to protect buyers and sellers. Upto now its worked to a degree.<br /><br />I bet my left nut NOTspacecase is new to the scene and got his referral the same way he is handing them out to anyone. People like you will be the ones that bring this whole thing to its knees and cause people to be arrested and sites closed down.<br /><br />Lots of people who were doing this while you were still sucking your mammas tit dont like people handing referrals out to strangers. SOS admin dont like you doing this and are actively seeking out and perma banning anyone&nbsp; handing out referrals.

				hey billy its easy to tell what your SoS account is just seeing your activity on both sites... not that i am going to post it or anything but i hope you only access SoS through tor or you are compromising your security though<br /><br />and i dont know why you are claiming OC was given a code, how would you know? he didnt receive one in this thread that i saw<br /><br />i said i might check but thats not the same, maybe someone else i referred got banned and i dont have the ability to give out codes. or maybe not but its not your business either way <br /><br />and spacecase is a troll <br /><br />but i do agree they should never be sold or traded. i got my code originally from another member of SR because i contribute to the community and am contributing to SoS now as well. this is a place for people with similar interests to come together, i dont necessarily understand why you are so outspoken against people sharing referrals with members they think could be of benefit or add something to SoS. just because its anonymous through someones posts you can get an idea how they would act on a different site as well imo even better than if you met someone on another clearnet forum

Its not illegal to browse and post on SR, it only becomes illegal when you purchase or sell.<br /><br />And you are right, I read spacecase&#039;s post wrong as I thought he/she said he/she would send one now.<br /><br />My post isnt meant as an attack on the OP. If you have to ask openly on SR for an SOS referral then to me you shouldnt be given one as its a well known fact that you should only give them to people you know. Its common knowledge and common sense that LE are members of SR so how do you know you are unwittingly giving LE a referral? you cant.<br /><br />Selling or trading SOS referrals is completely against SOS rules.<br /><br />The safety of the community at large relies on trust which goes out the window when people are handing out referrals to complete strangers. Im sure there are people on SR who genuinely know each other, but in these cases these people dont have to post threads asking for referrals.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi all if anyone could help me out with a SOS referral code I&#039;d be most grateful, I&#039;ve asked my supplier but he and his friend don&#039;t have enough karma to supply me with one and I&#039;d really like to add some feedback for him which has really been done sufficiently since the end of last year and he definitely deserves it, comms are great, delivery times impeccable and he&#039;s a generally all round nice guy and as we all know every seller deserves gratitude and feedback if they&#039;ve done a good job, especially if it&#039;s been more than once.<br /><br />Would really appreciate the help if anyone here can do so.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />MM
