				Cant connect to the road it said &quot;cant connect to server&quot; which usually when it sais that I see posts about it being down. Since I didn&#039;t see a thread about it I thought I would start one to see if this is happening to others. I been a member for 4 months so I know I&#039;m using the right link.

				Working fine for me mate, I get the same problems sometimes, just spam the try again button and use the new identity button on tor, you should get in eventually :)

				Thanks for the replies everyone I just wanted to update my post and say that I was able to connect after spamming the try again button and changing identity a few times. But as most of us know the road can be up and down some days and sounds like gaja is having the same problem. As of now I am able to go on just fine but sometimes in situations like this is helps to try this link:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/home

				SR is a massive site on the dark net. Probably the highest traffic by a long shot.<br /><br />Someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong, I&#039;m curious, but although it&#039;s location is technically hidden, the server is connected to the internet somewhere. Your ISP can see Tor traffic coming in, but not what is inside it. But I think a site as large as this probably has massive amounts of tor traffic entering the ISP. I don&#039;t know how they control for this, and am very impressed that their tech team was able to scale it up so quickly given the ever increasing growth. <br /><br />Curious how this hidden site stays hidden.
