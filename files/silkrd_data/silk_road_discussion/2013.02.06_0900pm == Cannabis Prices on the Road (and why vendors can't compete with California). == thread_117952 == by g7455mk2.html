				Simply put, the quality and price of cannabis on the road are about as erratic as they come.&nbsp; I&#039;ve by no means been here a long while (just under 6 months), but in that time have amassed the following stats:<br /><br />Total transactions: 29<br />Total spent: $3844.01<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br /><br />Clearly a buyer, and not a reseller - but also no small number of transactions nor money.&nbsp; My wife and I enjoy cannabis more than most things in life, SR has been a life-saver for us following Uni.<br /><br />Anyway, those 29 transactions have been spread out across roughly a dozen vendors (all domestic Cannabis), and largely ran the gamut in price from approximately $200-$300 per ounce, with one or two single gram orders to try out allegedly &quot;high quality&quot; vendors who were simply priced way, way too high to buy in quantity.<br /><br />Of those transactions, the highest quality grass I&#039;ve found all came in the lower end of that price spectrum, and coincidentally, all from California.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had outstanding samples from Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Michigan as well, but in terms of value for price - it&#039;s always California.<br /><br />So why is it that there seems to be very little competition when it comes to the road?&nbsp; I&#039;m noticing a more and more narrow selection of vendors to choose from, all of whom necessarily are gravitating towards that $200-$275/ounce price point.&nbsp; Those who aren&#039;t making those kinds of moves are either largely gone or clearly aren&#039;t making sales.<br /><br />On the one hand, it&#039;s nice to see the open market finally begin to affect cannabis prices in the U.S., but on the other, it&#039;s distressing that it seems there are few who can compete.&nbsp; It&#039;d be nice to see some more realistic pricing coming from other geographic locations.

				are you talking about outdoor grown or indoor grown..&nbsp; &nbsp;with the right genetics it dosn&#039;t matter what state your in. the advantage would go to the place with colder outdoor climate and the lowest priced electric supply&nbsp; here is a question. If you built 2 indoor growhouses&nbsp; one in california and one in (pick whatever state)&nbsp; and used the same clones, nutes and experience of growhouse manager who does better?

				let&#039;s just say I&#039;ve spent many years in California. the Bay Area specifically. SR weed prices amaze me. IRL, its not uncommon for me to get 1.2 grams of good (not great) weed for $10. gram for $10 is really common. I guess I&#039;ve become &quot;spoiled,&quot; lol

				Great topic! Being experienced in the California market id say it has alot to do with the fact that its been legal in California for so long, creating its own market. That combined with the fact that AMAZING outdoor can be grown fairly cheap makes the prices so low. To be honest though, ive seen ounces of certain strains ( GSC, Cherry pie etc) sell for up to $400 per ounce. The difference is that it is ACTUAL TOPSHELF INDOOR opposed to alot of the greatly grown outdoor that people claim is indoor, as you see on SR. You definitely can get good weed for 10 a gram easily in Cali but the great stuff isnt that cheap. There are a couple of other vendors on here besides ourselves who actually appear to have some True Topshelf bud. So essentially id say the outdoor factor combined with over a decade head start in a market is why you&#039;ll see most of the best weed and prices come from that area.

				As a long time cannabis vendor I hope that the weed industry dosn&#039;t get into a race to the bottom&nbsp; I had that happen in a legal business I was in. Ultimatley only the real big players will make any money everyone else just squeeks by..

				Marijuana smokers definitely do need to be vigilant in supporting mom and pop quality growers as this herb slowly becomes legal.&nbsp; If not,&nbsp; we&#039;ll all be buying bottom quality from phillip morris before we know it.&nbsp; <br /><br />It would be an absolute shame to see the cannabis industry controlled by a few giants.&nbsp; Cartels already control way too much.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth paying $10 or $20 more an ounce to support a small business.&nbsp; We can&#039;t let this industry go the way of Wal-mart!! LOL.... but seriously!!

				ECC and NWPG have the right ideas - I&#039;ve always been east coast-based and the weed quality here is constantly middle-ground at best (in terms of what the dipshit street dealers consider &quot;heads&quot; here) and everyone swears they&#039;ve got OG Kush every batch - green, yellow, orange, purple - somehow it&#039;s all &quot;totally legit OG Kush.&quot; yeah, right.<br /><br />SR has been a godsend for weed science nerd-snobs like myself. I can see what I&#039;m buying, and talk to the person buying it knowing they have some clue of what they&#039;re talking about. I stopped buying off the street when my dealers knew less about their plant than I did just by looking at it or smelling it.<br /><br />as far as pricing goes - yeah, I agree, it&#039;s always gonna be hard to top prices from the growers in California and the west coast. the crop is plentiful, tons of people are growing it and experimenting, which means lots of extra crop that - even if it&#039;s not top shelf medical grade - is still damn good weed. <br /><br />my personal opinion, though, is that the best bud I&#039;ve gotten off SR has consistently been from the pacific NW. those Washington and Oregon growers have their shit on lock.

				I think the original post is exhibiting an overall economics fail. <br /><br />If you live in a market that has lower prices for geographical and political reasons, then clearly you would buy from that market for lower prices. <br /><br />But if you don&#039;t have access to that market, you end up paying a premium for access to such market. This happens all the time with many markets. <br /><br />We cannot level the overall market just because that&#039;s what you want, It is the state that creates this disequilibrium, what your asking for, none of us <br />have any market incentives to do, and the person doing it would face little gain.&nbsp; Why would someone take on a variety of felonies , and the possibility of a conspiracy charge<br />that could hold a life sentence, if they could equally gain from simply selling in their local market for far less risk?&nbsp; They don&#039;t, if they are going to do that, they are going to do so <br />at a price.&nbsp; <br /><br />We see 100 buck weed here too, but Colorado just doesn&#039;t have the outdoor market. Cali though has alot of good quality outdoor, and outdoor is inherently priced lower.&nbsp; The dispensary market from cali to Colorado isn&#039;t all that different, aside from the outdoor factor.&nbsp; I know for certain that there is plenty of Cali weed marketed here as indoor, when its just good quality outdoor.

				As a Cali resident and Cali vendor, I would say the prices on SR are about 10-20% higher than what you pay walking into a dispensary here in Cali. I personally attribute the 10-20% markup to the fact that BTC are a pain in the ass to turn into cash so vendors need to compensate for the hassle. I would say most vendors are based out of states where marijuana is legal to grow on some level, which is why there isn&#039;t too much price variation.<br /><br />From what I understand, on the East Coast and Midwest, eighths are usually around $60, and the quality isn&#039;t always there. So if you don&#039;t live in a state where marijuana is legal, SR is actually a good deal for you. <br /><br />A lot of Cali residents flooded Colorado when Medical Marijuana became legal a few years ago so I would reckon there is a lot of good bud coming out of there. The reason why Cali can&#039;t be beat generally is because we&#039;ve been doing this on a massive scale longer than anyone else. The Emerald Triangle up north has been pumping out bud since before Medical grows became legal, and over the years our outdoor has gotten significantly better. Indoor growing has come a thousand miles in the last 10 years, walk into a hydroponics shop here in Cali and if the owner is knowledgeable he will talk your ear off for hours about how to get the most bud per watt of light, every trick to get the most trichomes, curing and storing methods, the newest and best nutrient formulas, it&#039;s crazy how growing weed is less of a hobby and more of a science these days. <br /><br />As far as indoor goes, a smart grower can recreate the same environment (temperature, humidity, and light) in any state. However the fact of the matter is that per-capita, Cali has more quality growers than any other state. Sure, we have plenty of idiots that just stick plants in a closet with a light...but we literally have thousands of expert growers producing hundreds of thousands of pounds every year without fear of the law because it&#039;s basically legal out here. So, on average, the best prices and best bud come from Cali. I&#039;m not saying we are the only ones with good bud and good prices, I&#039;m just saying there&#039;s more of us than any other state or country. Weed is California&#039;s cash crop, literally.&nbsp;

				One fact no one has mentioned yet in this thread is that there have been a large number of dispensary closures in the SoCal (LA and SD both enacted major anti-MMJ regulations in 2011) market in 2012 which lead to a lack of buyers for the growers. This glut of weed has driven MMJ wholesale prices down for the remaining dispensaries (and SR vendors) for much of 2012. The new crop (2012 crop) is just starting to hit the market. We&#039;ll see if the growers have cut back on supply to adjust to the new realities of the SoCal MMJ dispensary market.&nbsp;

The problem DEFINITELY is a flooded outdoor Cali market. The great Cali bud is not outdoor. Beautiful outdoor can be grown but Cali has an influx of GREAT INDOOR that makes the area elite. Many people(especially on SR) havent had true topshelf Cali bud sorry to say. There are a slim couple of listing that are True indoor dispensary level bud that ive seen since being on here. A LB of REAL topshelf bud can be sold to a club in Cali for alot more than SR users are willing to pay. So comparing outdoor to outdoor isnt much of a comparison if your talking about the OVERALL best bud.

				I am still a newbie to the SR, ive placed my first cannabis order a couple days ago, im waiting on it now...and let me just say this about the prices here: I have had a much harder time finding buds on SR that are equally priced, or more expensive than what is costs here on the streets in the midwest USA...I just paid something like $800 for a qp of SDM&#039;s light dep weed, and im expecting to turn it for no less than $1200+ on the streets. Hell, the lowest i&#039;ve ever been able to find a QP for on the streets was $1100, and it was some pretty bunk shit.<br /><br />I plan on sampling a few different vendors as well, to pick a couple I can go through on a consistent route...pounds for $2300-$2600?? I cant even find pounds for under $4000 IRL!! And thats when you can actually find a connect that can even get the pounds for you, and I can almost guarantee it wouldnt have the quality it would have if it came from Cali!
