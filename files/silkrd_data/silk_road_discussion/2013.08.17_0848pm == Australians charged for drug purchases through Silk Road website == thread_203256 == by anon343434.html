				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">THREE West Australians, including two teenagers, have been convicted in recent months for buying drugs through a notorious underground website.<br /><br />Police say the successful convictions should serve as a warning to the public that buying drugs online will only lead to “destructive outcomes.”<br /><br />The three, aged 15, 17 and 26, were arrested and charged after they purchased drugs from the Silk Road website.<br /><br />The arrests were the result of a police operation dubbed Operation Cinder conducted by Esperance Detectives and the Technology Crime Investigations Unit.<br /><br />As a result of the operation the two teenagers, who are brothers, were charged with 16 drug related offences, including possession of a prohibited drug with intent to sell or supply and attempt possession of drugs with intent to sell or supply<br /><br />Late last month, the two teenagers were jailed when they appeared in the Perth Children’s Court.<br /><br />One was jailed for 12 months and the other was jailed for eight months.<br /><br />Further investigations led detectives to seize seven ecstasy pills, 6.8g of cannabis and 0.7g of cocaine bought from Silk Road, which arrived in WA on September 25 and October 2 last year.<br /><br />A 26-year-old man was later charged over the seizure and fined $1000.<br /><br />Technology Crime Investigation Manager Detective Senior Sergeant Troy Douglas said people caught buying illicit drugs from the Silk Road website would face serious charges.<br /><br />He urged parents to be mindful of their children’s online activity at all times.<br /><br />“Parents who do not actively monitor what sites their children are using on computers and smart phones shouldn&#039;t be surprised when police execute a search warrant or charge their son or daughter with serious offences,” he said.<br /><br />“Sites such as Silk Road will only lead to a destructive outcome.”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />CLEARNET LINK: http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/wa-teens-charged-for-drug-purchases-through-silk-road-website/story-e6frg6n6-1226694659441<br /><br />Does anybody have any ideas on how this happened, how LE caught them seeing as it doesn&#039;t say anything about them confessing to it. I wasn&#039;t aware someone could be charged for being a suspected buyer, (an entire operation just for that?!) I thought LE would spend that time and effort on something more than just a few folks buying small amounts. (yet they charged them with intent to sell despite the small amounts they did seize)<br /><br />Thoughts/theories/opinions?

				Wait a second, so they created a whole operation named &quot;Operation Cinder&quot; to nab a 15 year old and 17 year old buying not large quantities of drugs? What fucking idiots. Honestly, the only people that deserved to be jailed are the ones who came up with this fucking idea. What pieces of shit, I hope they rot in hell.<br /><br />Since it was kids who got caught I would venture to say they were probably idiots and talked about it a lot or made other stupid blatant mistakes, nothing to worry about.

				This is old news but since you asked about it here&#039;s more information on the same operation (all clearnet):<br />http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/734298/detectives-follow-the-silk-road/<br />http://www.esperanceexpress.com.au/story/1151238/packages-intercepted-through-australia-post-each-day/<br /><br />It sounds like they aren&#039;t that huge of a town if they only get 100 packages a day. It probably isn&#039;t that difficult to spot especially if its not domestic. If all they have to boast about is a couple of teenagers and a 20 something who ended up with a fine, it seems to me like they are probably just seizing what they can and trying to scare people out of ordering by convicting some dumbass kinds who more than likely bragged about it at school or on twitter or whatever.<br />

				It would be just terrible, but I wonder when the people will become fed up with the police state and will just start hiding in the hills and putting bullets in cop&#039;s heads as they roll down the road?&nbsp; Not that they deserve it, at least not all of them.&nbsp; Those that write the laws and order them to enforce these evil laws, by crooked cops, all over this evil empire.<br /><br />Fucking shit!<br /><br />Again, please don&#039;t do that.&nbsp; That was be just awful for the people who had to clean it up and they might cause an accident and hurt an innocent person&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be terrible.&nbsp; I sure hope that never happens anywhere, especially in this only bastion of freedom known as the USA.&nbsp; I mean...we are free in every way.&nbsp; You can do anything you want as long as it doesn&#039;t directly harm others.&nbsp; No...wait....we are the new Nazi Germany, except we are way more high tech and we have the capacity to have the &quot;thought&quot; crimes, enforced by the &quot;thought police&quot;.&nbsp; The Propaganda ministry tells the talking heads what to say and if you don&#039;t agree then you are labeled as insane, given mind-altering drugs,&nbsp; or just fucked all the way around.&nbsp; Hell, now you can have your kids taken and the evidence they site is &quot;teaching your children to mistrust the government&quot;.

				The kids parents opened their mail and called the police to teach them a lesson. I&#039;m sure they didn&#039;t expect their kids to go to jail.<br /><br />They coughed up everything, there was no technology used by police, just informers and good cop bad cop. Very traditional.<br /><br />Esperance is something like 1000kms from Perth...&nbsp; A very small town.<br /><br />The only alarming things is the fact that they got custodial sentences.....

				The local post office probably sees around 100 items of international post a day, not exactly hard to single out the SR orders really, even the laziest doughnut eating LEO could pick a few items out.<br /><br />Custodial sentences in this case are a fucking travesty of justice, utter waste of time, money, resources and peoples lives.

				i agree it would be a last resort (say if) you had a son violently addicted to heroin, and was thieving off family members and being as equally dog and as a father there was nothing you could do, to me prison would be a good humbling experience, sure as hell set me straight, well straightish also looking back and this is just me i wish me oldies had have done something extreme to sort me out other than me being a law unto myself for far to long!!! but i respect anyones parenting decisions, if i had to raise me some extreme beat downs may have been&nbsp; good LOL

				This moral issue gets me every day, it fucks with my conscience that my 17 year old could be doing as I do on here. (trust me, she&#039;s not, where the fuck she is I have no idea though... :-\)&nbsp; As much as I love being part of something like SR I hate that I can&#039;t see a fix for this in the near future.&nbsp; Age is Unanimity.....and unanimity is necessary. <br />.<br />As far as LE go in this case..., these guys ran an advertising campaign which made it impossible of LE to ignore.&nbsp; &nbsp;They don&#039;t pursue anyone for a few grams of shit.... but if people so stupid make it impossible to ignore, idiocry will win and LE will be forced to come up with some &#039;cool&#039; name for an operation that fell into their laps and stained their bullshit uniform.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then the boss of the area obviously needs media for his promotion, its how it works.... so its like a scene from &#039;underbelly&#039;.&nbsp; I love Australian cops... come get me ya fucken dopey fat fucks..&nbsp; I dont say much really but the reputation of LE here, and definitely the public servants checking shit sent into this counrty is way way out of proportion. I would call them all fat lazy cunts but I would offend some acquantinces I have and I wouldn&#039;t want to do that.&nbsp; They&#039;re not all fat anyway. <br />.<br />
