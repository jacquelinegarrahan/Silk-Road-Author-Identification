				First, I&#039;m sorry to hear that you&#039;ve received 1/10 packages recently. However, why have you ordered so much if your not receiving anything? I&#039;d be worried about your address, there&#039;s a chance the vendors might not be the scammers, and your packages are being intercepted.<br /><br />Also, do you do your research properly, check feedback, read reviews here? Sure, there are scammers, they&#039;re everywhere, but I&#039;ve always thought SR deal with this very efficiently, if there&#039;s a whiff of scam their vendors account gets shut down pretty quickly.<br /><br />Best advice I can give is to definitely change your delivery address. Be safe. :)

				96% sounds about right, IF you do your homework. :o<br /><br />1 out of 10? Wow, I&#039;d shoot myself. No wonder you are out of here. :P<br /><br />I still think a lot of newbies are getting popped.<br />We don&#039;t have much sympathy for them anymore?<br />I do admit most jump in without reading the forums closely.<br />However the FE scams are totally out of control, with no recourse. :&#039;(

				seriously you must just buy from the most shady people offering ridiculously obvious deals that are too good to be true and never do any research at all and pick the lowest vendor scores.<br /><br />in a year i have only lost two orders, both of which were my fault for finalizing early as one of the first to try out gummystars and then tony. way too many orders to count using probably twenty to thirty vendors who were all legit thanks to this wonderful community and the forum activity which enables one to actually get fucking reviews of the drug before one decides to buy!? whodathunkit<br /><br />i have had an express package mysteriously go missing but that was postal system failure as tracking showed it entering but literally disappeared as if stolen or lost - vendor even reshipped entire order thats how awesome some vendors actually are still

				I never had any package not come in yet; however, I did have some problems with two vendors but those issues were cleared and the packages were eventually delivered. I don&#039;t consider myself a &quot;smart&quot; individual by any stretch of the imagination, but I try use common sense and the boards, so I can avoid getting scammed. Getting scammed, unfortunately, is the chance we take when dealing with drugs. Plus, I only deal with &quot;soft&quot; drugs, so the chances of being scammed are lower than purchasing &quot;hard&quot; drugs.<br />

				This guy is just venting and angry I&#039;ve come across a lot of assholes giving vendors or buyers bad names just cause either A. their scams didn&#039;t come to fruition or B. They can&#039;t get free product....I am new, SR is like a volatile stormy sea and these forums are a life raft you can either drown or cling to them and float to shore. Uniwiz is responsible for at least 35% of the helpful info I&#039;ve come across lol so thanks to him....READ THE WIKI PEOPLE AND SEARCH THE RUMOR MILL FOR VENDOR REVIEWS if your to lazy or too damn stupid to comprehend this you deserve the misfortune that will inevitably rain down on you!
