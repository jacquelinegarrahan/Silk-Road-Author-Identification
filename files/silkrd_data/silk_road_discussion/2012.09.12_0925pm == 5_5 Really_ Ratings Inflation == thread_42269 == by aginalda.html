				I recently received really good service from a SR vendor and was sorry that I could only give him or her a rating of 5/5.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I think that newbies like me tend to give 5/5 for any completed sale regardless of the service quality.&nbsp; Some vendors are also guilty of browbeating buyers into finalizing early and will become aggressive with buyers who leave less than 5/5.&nbsp; So in the end, what does 5/5 even mean?<br /><br />I wish that a rating of 5/5 corresponded to really excellent service: quick delivery, product as advertised, and responsive.&nbsp; 4/5 should indicate good service, 3/5 average, and so on.&nbsp; But I suspect buyers new to SR tend to feel obliged to FE and give 5/5 ratings and unfortunately that undermines the usefulness of the rating system.&nbsp;

				The reason why people like you and me as well as many others find it flawed is because there are A LOT of irresponsible buyers out there. A LOT of buyers simply get there drugs and fuck off into a room and use their product. Never returning to give proper feedback.<br /><br />There are also a lot of buyers who just don&#039;t have the common sense, common courtesy, or intellect to properly rate. There are a few buyers who have absolutely no respect for vendors and think they&#039;re place on top of a pedestal to frequently judge people with their superior knowledge of how drug smuggling/quality/etc... works. Well, I have one thing to say to those people-OPEN A FUCKING VENDOR&#039;S ACCOUNT and show us how it is done.<br /><br />This game is not easy. Not the least bit. Some vendors may find it easy, but that is due to a vast number of years working in the business. They&#039;re entitled to say this and buyers should buy from them as long as they&#039;re here on SR.<br /><br />So, in regards to what I said, buyers need to properly rate vendors! If this happens then a bunch of this scamming, low class drug runners will decrease to a point where buyers will not succumb to lost finances daily and we won&#039;t have as many threads about &quot;Got Scammed!&quot;<br /><br />SJ

				I usually leave a 5/5 rating if it got to me with no major problems.&nbsp; However, I leave very detailed feedback and would include something like that the packaging could be a little better or if the quality wasn&#039;t as good as advertised. 5/5 to me means it got here and was what it was claimed to be.&nbsp; I&#039;ll leave comments regarding quality but its so subjective it shouldn&#039;t be factored into your rating unless its just terrible and claimed to be amazing in my opinion.

				yes i have wondered about this for a while. vendors seem to expect 5/5 no matter what these days, and i understand why, but it raises some problems.. <br /><br />i dont think price should be a factor- you agree to the price, so that&#039;s that. shipping time seems to be (for the most part) out of the vendor&#039;s hands&#039;. that&#039;s understandable. but if you are unhappy with security, it&#039;s rather difficult to explain why without dropping too many details, but as long as it arrived, should you rate 5/5?<br /><br />and especially with quality. there are some wild claims about purity of product on here, and sometimes (shockingly i know) vendors overstate the quality of their product to get more business. i suppose quality is subjective, but sometimes description/picture of product quality and what actually arrives are a world apart. so yes the package arrived, yes it was at least whatever drug it claimed to be, but blatantly lower quality than what was advertised- does that warrant a lower rating? <br /><br />for the most part, the only reason to leave less than perfect rating seems to be if a) nothing arrived at all/vendor scammed, or b) weight was off or it was a different drug entirely. is this how it should be? <br /><br />and then at the same time buyers constantly abuse the system and attempt to hold vendor&#039;s rating &quot;hostage&quot; until their claims/demands are met. sometimes there is a valid reason for this, sometimes it&#039;s just kids scamming for free drugs. <br /><br />it&#039;s a tricky system...<br /><br />

				If i get what i pay for in a decent amount of time with no major problems i always give 5/5. its common curtsy. a lot of 4/5 really hurt a vendors rating. i have seen so many ridiculous ratings such as leaving 1/5 for slow shipping time, etc.

				Here is how the rating system works:<br /><br />1-Shipping-includes packaging(stealth)/time elapsed, etc<br /><br />2-Communication-not response time because a lot of vendors have day jobs as well as get 10&#039;s, if not a 100 PMs a day<br /><br />3-Quality-not everyone has the same tolerance and some will abuse this(not a perfect system, but us vendors have a way of dealing with this)&nbsp; :)<br /><br />4. Politeness<br /><br />5. Refund-if the vendor refunds or SR refunds<br /><br /><br />#4 is a toss up between people. It can be replaced by QUANTITY of product. Ex: If product is underweight. Now, a 5/5 can be given if the packaging was poor, but made it to it&#039;s destination. All you have to do in this situation is mention it in the ratings. <br /><br />Vendors take heed to these(most) and improve on the quality of how the process orders. DON&#039;T!! and I mean DON&#039;T threaten a vendor&#039;s feedback or reputation on the forums because the cake isn&#039;t cut the exact way you wanted it! This dog won&#039;t walk! You will be black listed and have to start a new account!<br /><br />Simply tell the vendor in a polite way what your concerns are. If the vendor neglects this reply then voice your opinion on the forum. This is all a part of buyer&#039;s and seller&#039;s etiquette.<br /><br />SJ

				It&#039;s either 5/5 or 1/5. People are worried about getting fucked if they order again or by other vendors.<br />I like how eBay works, Positive/Neutral/Negative and the detailed ratings which are anonymous.

				If you have any qualms with your order, you should PM your vendor asap. It pisses me off no end when people write &quot;good, bit stalky&quot; 4/5, I can&#039;t imagine how vendors must feel.<br /><br />If you got your order and it looks like what its on the menu and is not significantly underweight i.e. &lt;+-0.1g then it should be a 5.<br /><br />Reliability is by far the most important parameter to me, at the end of the day I want my drugs and I want them looking like the picture and I want them fairly concealed. Thats it.<br /><br />I can understand that yes the 5/5 if it meets those parameters isn&#039;t perfect, but there are always c***s out there who will thinks that it &quot;isn&#039;t cheese, good delivery though 3/5&quot; and fuck up an otherwise reliable vendors reputation. Add into consideration that everyones definition of a 4/5 or whatever isnt necessarily constant, I think the 5/5 if its what it is the right weight is a better system.<br /><br />

				Though I&#039;m new to SR and just a buyer here, I can see how the feedback system leaves sellers vulnerable to unreasonable buyers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Would it be good if the SR system included a way for sellers to rate buyers in the same way that buyers now rate sellers?&nbsp; I would guess that responsible buyers would welcome this.&nbsp; Also, would it make sense to weigh the impact of a buyer&#039;s feedback on a seller based on the buyer&#039;s stats?&nbsp; That way, a first-time buyer&#039;s complaint would have less impact on a seller&#039;s cred than the feedback of a more experienced buyer.&nbsp; It would seem that good buyers and good sellers both have the same interest: that is, each benefits from having accurate insight into the character of the other.&nbsp; A good rating system should provide that insight.

				Maybe place a&nbsp; buyers stats next to rating, like in the forums. Newbie, hero ect. Then you can tell how much stock to put in the rating itself.

				5/5 with a raving response = vendor came through and did something extra<br />5/5 and normal response = vendor came through but did nothing extra<br />4/5 = vendor came through but something was off - packaging was bad, a bit underweight. generally satisfied but could be better<br />3/5 = vendor came through but something was very wrong, but not because of a vendor&#039;s laziness/unattentiveness<br />1-2/5 = vendor either did not come through, or actively was a dick or tried to screw over the buyer. only immature vendors who are destined to fail will ever get this.<br /><br />This is how it is now - and it works.
