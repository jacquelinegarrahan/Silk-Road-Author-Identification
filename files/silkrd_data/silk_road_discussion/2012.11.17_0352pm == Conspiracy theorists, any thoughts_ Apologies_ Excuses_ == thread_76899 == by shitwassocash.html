				Now that we&#039;ve heard from DPR, I&#039;m curious what the conspiracy theorists have to say. I think&nbsp; a lot of them knew themselves that they were full of shit, hence why most of them used shill accounts.<br /><br />Complainers had every right to air their grievances (I myself was very vocal about how piss poorly was handled) but I feel like those who were directly slandering the character of DPR by insisting he scammed us all, owe some kind of apology/retraction/explanation.<br /><br />I can respect someone who admits they made a mistake, but the pussies who are never going to acknowledge all the shitty accusations they made are lower than trash.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />haha, I wonder how many will insist DPR didn&#039;t update us, that the site has been hijacked by LE, and continue speculating nonsense that has no evidence or basis in reality.

				LOL Jezuz. <br /><br />Yeah, you went overboard in your accusations and conspiracy theories. Yes you did. But so? No biggie. Everything is back to normal. <br /><br />At least now you know not to jump to too many conclusions before giving things a wide berth to get sorted out. <br /><br />And when the next event comes up, you can point and laugh at the noobs going crazy or console them by using your experience as an example. <br /><br />I don&#039;t fault you for going a bit batty. The high degree of anonymity of this place makes it ripe from scams. The more one has at stake to lose, the more emotional one will be. Perfectly understandable.&nbsp; <br />

				Nah, I expect to one day lose money here. The very nature of this setup speaks to that eventuality. I might get a little frustrated, call people out on their BS for the sake of protecting others from getting ripped, report to SR admins, but that&#039;s about it. <br /><br />So far, after over 80 transactions and 5 figures spent, not a dime lost. All that is due to never finalizing early. Plus I&#039;m a good customer. I finalize on receipt. I don&#039;t message the hell out of a vendor - if it&#039;s on their profile page, I&#039;m not going to ask as if it wasn&#039;t there. Hell, I&#039;ve had such a stellar time on here that when the day comes that I lose, it&#039;ll be like a finally paying admission. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been around for a good bit and I&#039;ve seen the scams and the loses on here. It&#039;s sad. Most were avoidable. Simply never finalizing early would have saved most. Except for the BTC exchanger scams. <br /><br />If SR get&#039;s pinched, there isn&#039;t fuck all that can be done. We hope that day will never, ever come. But who knows, right? <br /><br />Anyway, walk good my friend.

				It was that fucking twat following me around like a bad smell and yes, I agree it was unnecessary and believe me when I say it wasn&#039;t me doing the trolling.<br /><br />I call shit EXACTLY how I see it, and as I said it&#039;s not inconceivable that LEO took over shit and TBH I should have been contacted earlier the way I was last night after having to go through mods and shit to get something back on a &quot;missing&quot; $2K worth of shit. <br /><br />I had every right to be pissed about the treatment myself and others received, and if you can&#039;t get a little perspective every now and again that perhaps you don&#039;t like to hear then all I can say is grow up!<br /><br />My thoughts were put out there to fucking help caution you people, not to STIR UP SHIT and furthermore, if you bothered to read what I had said, I HOPED TO GOD I WAS WRONG and capitalised my shit NUMEROUS TIMES praising DPR etc, but many of us thought he&#039;d jumped ship.<br /><br />Now, what if in fact I was right and you put your names addresses BTC payments etc through a Govt system (people still are with Bitinstant I might add) you would all be screwed and I would say &quot;I told you so&quot; but it&#039;s like you fuckers actually thought I WANTED SR to be comprompised, I WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE SHIT, I WANTED to have some jerkoff follow me around on everything I say. <br /><br />If you look it&#039;s that git trolling me, not the other way around and I refuse to have Coke Bear boy tell me how to think, because unlike him I have critical reasoning skills.<br /><br />Blind faith is what Creationists have people, not INTELLIGENT people who are analytical.<br /><br />Last but not least, when I&#039;m having random vendors out of the blue come to me saying does shit seem really unusual to you, lot&#039;s of strange n00bs etc, the wheels start turning and you start looking at things (especially when you&#039;re out 2K) in a critical light.<br /><br />Next time something like this happens, or if DPR is compromised, then I won&#039;t say shit I&#039;ll just let you all go down.<br /><br />You think I wanted to waste hours of my time trying to help a bunch of strangers think a bit harder about themselves and their actions?<br /><br />Talk about fucking unappreciative!

				Honestly, I have to agree with jezuz... He&#039;s right was handled sort of poorly and I was in the same position and it sucks.. If you were in that position you wouldnt be talking shit... I had my issues sorted out after posting a bunch and tracking down mods and messaging a bunch of people but now its on the way to being sorted out... But point is, sorted out or not... It was still dealt with a bit poorly everyone was worrying and out of the loop and lots of money was potentially on the line.. Period.. So you should stop bashing on jezuz and leave him the fuck alone considering you would feel the same if you were in his position.. So of course when you attack the OP hes going to get defensive and fed up and say shit. Some people work hard for there money..... As for his right to use the road he was peaceful and fine until he freaked out about his coins and all the SR bullshit that is now sorted but can you blame him? tons of people were freaking out and creating theories.. Just my .02cents...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=76899.msg602547#msg602547">Quote from: JezuzWazaMushroom on November 17, 2012, 08:48 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">At the end of the day who&#039;s to blame?<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t my fuckup, and as I said to someone else, if I took over $2k of your money and you hardly knew me, and said I was doing something with it, disappeared and ignored you and generally treated you like a goose, and stop responding to you or your calls and I was supposed to be trust worthy and if not at least show face but didn&#039;t, so what would you be saying, thinking and feeling?<br /><br />It wouldn&#039;t be a few little words on a screen saying hardly anything derogatory at all... no, you&#039;d be with your mates driving around looking to cave my head in, correct?<br /><br />End of story!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=76899.msg602534#msg602534">Quote from: BenJesuit on November 17, 2012, 08:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">LOL Jezuz. <br /><br />Yeah, you went overboard in your accusations and conspiracy theories.

				i notice i have more negative karma.. thats not cool. All i was saying is i was and still am in the same position as jezuz.. and it was very nerve racking etc.. and he has more coins in his account then i do.. but i work hard for my money.. In the end DPR came through sorted everything out and even helped me out and messaged me back about my account and coins. I can see why he would lash out get mad and make threats. but do agree threats are not very good or the right thing to do. but sometimes people lose there sanity i guess lol. I also notice that the one other OP has been following Jezuz posts and kind of egging him on.. but this is not my place to say anything more just quit with the bad karma please someone give me good karma anyone? lol

				It&#039;s like this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=17472">Quote from: RxKing on November 11, 2012, 04:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br /><br />First...I am not accusing you of shit..I am telling you the story&#039;s we get about you. You have a hard time understanding things. I told you about the complaints we get. YOU have been accused of it. I don&#039;t give a fuck either way. I don&#039;t know or care if you make fake accounts or not. I tell them I can&#039;t delete a post in your feedback based on what they think. But you are always alerting us to post about you that you don&#039;t like. I never delete them as there is no reason&nbsp; too. I can&#039;t help no one likes you in here. Soon it won&#039;t matter anyways.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care if you bump your own threads. I am just telling&nbsp; you...much how you tried to complain about the fake account...people complain about you. I don&#039;t have to point out to you all the threads. YOU KNOW in that one thread where YOU said you would not post in it at all....First you bump it multiple time(embarrassing)..then you actually post in it!! Again I don&#039;t give a fuck but your whole argument to me is that you didn&#039;t do it and that a bump is not a post. Well ok I just proved you to be a liar because you not only POSTED a&nbsp; bump multiple time.....you then made a post!!!!...Again I don&#039;t care...It just go&#039;s to show how full of shit you are. You made the OP saying you would not post and you then do.. It was pointed out to you and you were made fun of. YOU JUST LOOK LIKE THE LIAR YOU ARE.<br /><br />YOU know all this. You know what you have posted and said. And you are right in one thing...You can post your opinion. But you should not be critical of certain people. You tell mods to fuck off, you tell anyone who does not agree with you to fuck off. It is not very smart. You tried to get MrOuid kicked out and that whole thing backfired. Not only that....but you just look so stupid.<br /><br />The only reason you are still allowed in the Vendor forum is DPR has been to busy to do anything. You are going to be warned again by him. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to waste any more time on you. I was only writing you to warn you and to tell you to quit reporting post that you don&#039;t like. Again you just look foolish.<br /><br />Good luck to you. You really need it.<br /><br />Oh and I proved you are a liar. So quit like you said you would. <br /><br />Also know that your word is complete shit to this whole community. No one trust you or believes a word you say. You act like an idiot 23yr... <br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And that&#039;s also the reason why he is no forum mod anymore.<br />Came to me, crying about me having posted on his post, he didn&#039;t like that I did.<br />He just could&#039;ve locked his topic too...<br />Then came to me, saying I made fake accounts etc, because other members had the same though like me and posting on it too...<br />But messaging me about fake accounts etc...<br />No, this community is becoming worse every second.<br />And note, none of all the things he says to me are true.<br /><br />Koelen3.
