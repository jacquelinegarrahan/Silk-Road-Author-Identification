				I have had one order cancel before and the coins appeared almost within the hour of receiving the message that it had been cancelled.&nbsp; It has happened today, I got a message from the Do Not Reply saying that the vendor cancelled my purchase, but the coins havent appeared in my wallet on Silk Road.&nbsp; <br /><br />How long have some of you waited for the funds to appear? Is there anybody that I can contact to figure out why my coins havent shown up in such a long time?<br /><br />Thanks for the help.
