				I made a new address on my account for making a bitcoin deposit, deposited the coins a few hours ago, and confirmed in blockexplorer that it was received (16 blocks ago in fact). 8 blocks ago, I see the bitcoins leaving that for another address, I assume part of the internal SR tumbling.<br /><br />But they have yet to show up as available on my account. Anybody else having this problem?

				Thats funny, I have had a few customers finalize their orders in the last couple of days and my account balance has just gone down. I&#039;m owed about $500 despite my customers doing everything right. When they finalize from escrow the funds are just never sent to me. Now there are funds even missing from my account. This morning when I checked my account balance had gone down by 1.3 BTC which shouldn&#039;t even be possible because I&#039;m waiting on a PIN reset right now. I don&#039;t know whats going on but it seems like SR is having some serious problems processing payments. The worst part is that Vendor Support hasn&#039;t even read my messages yet. So there is no indication that this issue is going to be resolved or that I will ever get my money back. <br /><br />-TGX

				Yeah I&#039;m having problems as well. Made a deposit about 3 hours ago that indeed shows it has been sent and received. This really sucks :/<br />This needs to be fixed asap as this could induce big big problems.

				Hi folks,<br /><br />The deposit process can take up to 24 hours but normally takes a lot less.<br />If you&#039;re checking the deposit on a site such as blockchain.info then what you&#039;re seeing is Silk Road&#039;s tumbler in action. There is nothing to worry about, and you will receive your coins.<br /><br />If you do not receive your Bitcoin within 24 hours of having sent them, you can contact SR Support on the main site using the link in the bottom right hand corner of any page.<br /><br />The GreenXchange, please check your PMs.<br /><br />Libertas

				I am not seeing my deposit and it has already 20 something confirmations. It has never taken this long before and lately it is just crazy.

				24 hours?<br /><br />You must be new around here, moderator. That&#039;s not how it works; I&#039;ve been a member since the days when the forums were part of the main site, and within minutes of the 6th confirmation, the funds show up in your account on the road. Always. Unless there is a problem.<br /><br />Trust me when I say that there is a problem, and if you have a way of notifying DPR, it would be in your best interest to do so.

I understand you being worried because it has never taken more than 3 hours for you before, but I have transferred almost $20,000 to my buyer account over my time on Silk Road and it has taken anywhere from 20 minutes to 20 hours for the Bitcoin to be received.<br /><br />20 confirmations is roughly 3 hours and 12 minutes (with a new block currently being mined roughly every 9.6 minutes) so until it reaches 150 confirmations (24 hours) there is no cause for concern.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my previous post, if you do not receive your Bitcoin within 24 hours of having sent them then you can contact SR Support on the main site using the link in the bottom right hand corner of any page.<br /><br />Regarding the 3 digit captcha, it is fine and normal; you can read more on that here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156229.msg1093971#msg1093971<br /><br />Libertas<br /><br />EDIT: Thank you for clarifying, scout.

				Made a 1400 dollar deposit a few hours ago. No sign of coins yet although they have been good about such things in the past. Longest it EVER took for me is 8 hours, and I&#039;ve been here a year. I ain&#039;t gonna panic unless it takes more than 20-24 hours.

A significant chunk of the people posting about delays and possible issues stems from them checking their deposits on blockchain.info and thinking - from what they can see there - that their Bitcoin is arriving at their account then being withdrawn. They fail to take the SR tumbler into account when they see this occurring and start to worry.<br /><br />I&#039;m finished conversing with you on the matter; I&#039;ve explained the situation and the steps that need to be taken to remedy it if the funds do not arrive within 24 hours of sending them.<br /><br />If a significant number of people are still having issues after that 24 hour period, I will report it up the chain.<br />That should satisfy you whilst also giving the system time to do what it does.<br /><br />Libertas

				Server loads? The block chain is the block chain. The records are there in 1s and 0s. It&#039;s either being parsed or it&#039;s not. Clearly the network is working, or we wouldn&#039;t be able to load the site. If the network is working, the server should have a current copy of the block chain. If the pages are loading, the server should have enough computing capacity to parse the block chain.<br /><br />Clearly I don&#039;t know exactly how SR gets desynched from the block chain. But until somebody provides a technical explanation of how these deposit delays can be caused by things out of the control of SR, and resolved on their own, I&#039;m calling bullshit. I&#039;m pretty sure every time (at least, that I&#039;m personally aware of) that there has be a delay, the delay is &quot;until DPR logs in and resyncs the block chain&quot; or whatever he does.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been incredibly active with purchasing in the past few months, but in the last two years I&#039;ve moved a considerable amount of money into SR. Without fail, every time my deposit hasn&#039;t shown up after 6 confirmations plus a couple of minutes, DPR has had to &quot;fix&quot; the problem.<br /><br />So, you can argue your experience with this against my experience. I&#039;d love to hear a much more technical discussion of how these delays can be externally driven and why they should be tolerated. Your flippant answer that &quot;we&#039;re not losing money, the amount of bitcoins stays the same&quot; is ridiculous. You realize, of course, that nearly every price on the SR is pegged to a floating average for the USD? Sure, you don&#039;t control that exchange rate, but failures such as these CAN cause a significant loss of value, often times preventing a customer from purchasing what they intended to purchase in the first place. Your response to that is, &quot;We don&#039;t see you complaining when the price goes up!&quot; Well, I can&#039;t speak for everybody else, but my standard operating procedure it to completely minimize the time between USD is converted into BTC, and when those BTC are put into escrow at the SR. I&#039;m not interested in gambling with the exchange rate, but this failure in service is forcing me to. <br /><br />Worse, the item I&#039;m trying to buy may be sold out by the time I have the funds. It&#039;s really not appropriate to turn a blind eye to these concerns and blow them off like we&#039;re being impatient assholes. Worse yet, to argue with us and tell us that we should accept this with a shrug? This is a serious, high revenue business. The hobbyists posing as professionals with a &quot;moderator&quot; title (how many moderators have come and gone by now, btw?) should step back and wait until they have actual information instead of something copied and pasted from the list of approved responses.

				I just wanted to point out that in my experience, the speed at which bitcoins are transferred to your wallet HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SPEED OF THE SITE ITSELF. What it does have to do with, I don&#039;t fucking know. The speed of other sites? But it can take a really long time. Or it can take 10 minutes. And I can find no pattern as to why it happens once one way and then next another.

				Ah, it&#039;s just so frustrating! God knows this is when BTC would decide to get wrecked and shoot up in price &gt;_&lt;. Sucks for us who put in just enough to order and don&#039;t hold a balance in BTC. I usually keep a roughly 10% &quot;cushion&quot; on my order price when I buy coins to account for a coin swing but with deposits taking maybe 24 hours, you never quite know what can happen.

				I think I should just bend over and let someone put it in my butt over how much money I&#039;m losing.<br /><br />This is seriously somewhat ridiculous however.

				www.blockchain.info - enter the wallet tied to your SR account (the one you initiated the first transfer to). You should see if the wallet has held your balance, and if the tumbling process has started it will show a 0 balance and a transaction initiated into another shell wallet. This wallet will in turn show a number of transactions into it (not only your own, this is the tumbling process) and so on and so forth.

				It&#039;s coming up on 24 hours for me now too. I only have a few hours left or I will miss my vendor of the product I made the deposit for. I have messaged support twice and no response. I know it says &quot;up to 48 hours&quot; for a response from support, but when we&#039;re talking about people losing access to their money I think there needs to be a priority.<br /><br />I appreciate all you do for us. I think all we are saying is we&#039;ve all made dozens if not hundreds of deposits and the coins show up within minutes of hitting 6 confirmations. It is somewhat he<br /><br />In my case I made the deposit specifically because my vendor is going on vacation tonight and I need to get the order in by about noon today. I fully expected to wake up and see my btc or at least an answer from support. I have neither. I am trying to be upbeat and optimistic, but if I miss this vendor before he/she leaves for vacation I am going to end up paying twice as much for a lesser product. So please, please, please help me out and get the coins pushed through.

				I&#039;m with Farts on this one. We are dealing with a situation that I&#039;m sure noone, especially DPR wants to be happening but it&#039;s just a hitch. I deposited over $800 yesterday, blockchain and my wallet both show a successful transaction with over 30 confirmations but still no show in my account. It seems that something fucked up when I reset my deposit address to a new one. I transferred $900+ day before yesterday to my old deposit address and it went through in 6 confirmations. Oh well, try not to get your panties in a knot. All will be good soon. I know it&#039;s nerve wracking when money is involved but it will get straightened out. Keep the faith.

				Made a transfer to my SR account around 10PM last night. Here I am (8 1/2 hours later) after waking up 30min early to make some orders before I leave for work. Logged to my SR account only to realize my funds did not make my SR address even after 84 successful confirmations and 14 transfers. My heart started to race followed with some sort of extreme concern and fear and anger asking myself how could this be? Why? Did I do something wrong? I know I can&#039;t be more paranoid than I already am. I triple check everything. Then I found this thread...my heart felt less and stabilizing.

				Having a delay in coins arriving to my account. It has been over 8 hours since 6 confirmations were made, while usually coins start trickling in ~3-5 hours in. I usually use blockchain&#039;s &quot;send anonymously&quot; feature, which gives me a fowarding wallet, but I checked the end wallet in my SR account and the wallet I deposited into and the SR account is about 0.5 BTC short. Not stressing out or anything, just wanted to put it out there just in case coins do arrive but not all at once.

				yeah I&#039;ve already lost $300 worth of value just waiting for this to come through.. btc was at 123 when I bought and transferred.. It just keeps going lower and lower.. Really getting irritated, I understand these things happen but we&#039;re all losing money here.. I buy my coins right before I order so I don&#039;t lose or gain anything and what I pay for is already higher than what I exchange at due to fees and SR&#039;s buy price being the weighted average. Vendors have options to hedge their coins in escrow.. I really think the same rules should apply when users are making deposits.

				This is this VERY frustrating. I believe in DPR and SR, but in the past 2 weeks I&#039;ve lost nearly $400 to connectivity issues (without notice), and now to this. Our vendors pay a premium (which is partially shifted onto us the buyer). While SR is down BMR is running fine and taking less of a cut from its seller.

				My understanding is this is a tumbler problem? Why does SR have a tumbler? Is it to protect the administrators, because I can always use a private tumbler service if it would mean avoiding delays such as this.

				Can we please get a status update on this? I&#039;m past the 24 hour mark and all I&#039;ve heard is &quot;don&#039;t worry&quot;. I can&#039;t help but worry. The coins have lost value and I missed the window I had to get what I needed. I have an option for a replacement seller but if I don&#039;t the order in soon I&#039;ll have some pretty substantial problems. I really do appreciate all you do here and how complex it must be.<br /><br />Please consider things from a buyer&#039;s perspective for a moment. Some of us have been on here quite a while and done many deposits. I have never seen it take more than a few minutes after about 7 confirmations for the coins to appear. So when I saw over 10 confirmations and suddenly the coins were moved from my account out into other accounts it was a reasonable conclusion to think I had been hacked or compromised in some way. I still believe this is a possibility because I have not heard from DPR himself about what is going on. Perhaps my account itself wasn&#039;t hacked, but something is preventing the coins from making it where they belong. This caused a wonderfully reputable seller from losing my business before he/she left for vacation and is causing me to worry about detoxing at an inconvenient time. I respect the hell out of you all who run this site and appreciate the assurances that &quot;it&#039;s all good just wait&quot;. But I would love to hear from DPR himself that it is all good and possibly even an estimate of when the coins will transfer. In my case I am not worried about some festival or other big event. I am worried about getting sick and missing work. If I had RL contacts I would have pinged them already!<br /><br />This is not a flame. It&#039;s simply a request for more info from the big man. Thanks in advance for any insight he can provide.

				It&#039;s been almost 30 hours since I transferred funds to SR - still nothing, like the rest. I understand that technical glitches happen (I hope that is all this is!) but I am baffled by the lack of response from DPR regarding this. There is obviously a problem with SR (likely the tumbler, but who knows), and I think it is time DPR announced what the issue is, and when it will be rectified. <br /><br />SR is a for-profit enterprise and while the btc problem may not be fixed immediately, customers should expect to be kept apprised of the status of their deposits!<br /><br />PB.

				I had the same thing happen, it just took much longer than usual. Over 15 hours to be transferred into the account... and in the mean time the prices went down so i ended up 20$ short of the amount i needed.... what a shame!

				I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t go through all 400 pages of this thread. Has the &#039;deposit delay&#039; issue appear to have been resolved?<br />Seems like it by the last few posts. Anyone care to chime in? Before this poor old man sends his coins to SR?

				deposited about an hour ago took around 45 mins which is very good probably fastest yet so hopefully DPR has found a fix and started implementing it. Good old DPR he must be a busy man right now *sends him a pint*.
