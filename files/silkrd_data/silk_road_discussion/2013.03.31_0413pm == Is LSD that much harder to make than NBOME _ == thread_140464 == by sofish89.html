				I see a couple of really high rated vendors in the top 1% who seem to mass produce NBOME at a cheap price and have listings for 100, 1000, and 10,000 tab listings plus custom listings if you message them. They say they have chemists who produce them and can make any design and make any amount on demand for any potential buyers. <br />So why doesnt someone do this with real LSD? I&#039;m sure real LSD isnt too expensive too make if you have the right materials and the prices on SR are ridiculusly high for LSD (125 USD for a ten strip).<br />If someone can mass produce LSD and sell it for a third or even less than what people are currently charging, and sells the kind of bulk the NBOME ppl are selling, he can make a killing!

				nbome is a phenethylamine. LSD is an ergot based indole. Two totally different chems. LSD manufacture requires precursors that are near impossible to get ahold of to make in large amounts and the process takes much longer and requires much more precise measuring the the 2c family.<br />Easy to tell difference between the DOX&#039;s, nbomes, and real lsd. LSD you eat it in whatever form and you will be tripping within 30 to 90 minutes and it should last about 6-8 hours. Nbomes only dissolve in the mouth so if you just swallow it without keeping it under your tongue for an hour you won&#039;t trip. DOX&#039;s are very similar to LSD but last about twice as long. Then LSA just sux.

				LSD is usually produced from ergotamine/ergometrine/lysergic acid.<br />NBOMes are produced from 2C-C/B/I etc with 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.<br /><br />Both should be taken very serious precautions before making them as touching the crystal alone or getting some dust on you could make you trip balls, that&#039;s how albert hoffmann found out ;)

				It&#039;s not that its any harder or any less hard its just that the chemicals are so hard to get a hold of man you have to know some extremely high-ups to get massive quantities, and If you get caught in the process of manufacturing--that is it its a wrap on AT LEAST the next 10 to 20 years of your life... selling this stuff isn&#039;t a game brother especially whilst gambling with the most precious thing you own(your life) and if I was the one putting my life on the line I sure as hell wouldn&#039;t give no fucks about getting out the lowest price possible,you know? just be happy its here and you have SR man ! LSD is so beautiful you shouldn&#039;t care about the prices. I mean in some places a gram of bud goes for $20! Tabs only go for 7-10 :) which is fucking cheap compared to most other substances, you feel me?

There&#039;s always so many posts on drug forums talking about how they&#039;re not sure if they took something other than lsd. Just gotta think about the times and ROA as well as the source.<br /><br />In answer to OP&#039;s question, lsd is incredibly difficult to make even for experienced chemists let alone anyone else. Acquiring the precursors is difficult as well and there are stiff penalties if one is caught.

				LSD production requires cultivating the toxic Egot fungus. I&#039;ve read that it can be Cultivated but one would want to be very cautious doing so because Egot is responsible for warewolf and witch stores. It used to get into Bread and cause wild hallucinations. The process is for a Real Chemist, anything less will end up with toxic results.

				Um, do you not think that the fact the NBOMes are not actually illegal in most countries including the US has an effect on the prices when compared to LSD?<br /><br />You can set up a factory legally as opposed to a homebrewed LSD lab.

				1. lsd is much harder to make as it takes longer and is much harder to obtain the precursors for. Plus it has way more steps according to shulgin in order to create a truly pure substance. <br />2. I have put multiple people out of business in my state by simply testing what, on multiple occasions, was the best lsd in the area. I didn&#039;t do this to harm anyones business but to simply test before buying bulk. <br /><br />I have seen many people who claim to know how to make lsd and who claim it takes them 10 tabs get high proved wrong an uncountable amount of times at festivals. Seems like the latest trick last year was telling people it had been filtered through mint????wtf. obviously a pg or vg fluid with mint to cover up the nasty taste with some nbome in there.

LSD is the one everybody hears stories about, so it&#039;s the one that everybody wants to buy.

If they&#039;ve never tripped then they have no idea, let&#039;s remember most people aren&#039;t online looking up details. And these people have no clue wtf they are on.

				That LSD &amp; its precursors have been internationally criminalized for over 40 years combined with the newness of Nbome and the fact that global laws are still pretty slow to catch on to this new drug aswell as China being a major player in the production and distribution of RC&#039;s (China being miles ahead of the game) should add some clarity into this argument.
