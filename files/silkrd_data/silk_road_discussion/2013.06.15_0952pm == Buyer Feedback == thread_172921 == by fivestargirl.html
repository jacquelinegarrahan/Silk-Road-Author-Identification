				Title: <strong>Buyer Feedback</strong><br />

				I&#039;ve done a bit of research and it seems this topic has been brought up but I feel it merits bringing up again.<br /><br />I am a vendor and a good one at that. Out of 80 orders, I have had my feedback held hostage by 8 buyers. These buyers have threatened to leave bad feedback trying to scam for more product or btc refunds using different excuses - all of which are lies and their fault (fake addresses, etc).<br /><br />I am not a stupid vendor, I looked at each buyer&#039;s transaction history and evaluated them before confirming their orders and decided to sell to them. They all had very good stats.<br /><br />As I see it, the problem here is that vendors cannot leave feedback on their buyers and are scared to get negative feedback so they make deals to these extortionists who continue to scam other vendors. This is entirely unfair. Its not right to allow one side to voice their opinion without the other having the same right. We vendors have no way of reporting these things and are paying fees to be on SR and something needs to be done about it.<br /><br />Yes, there are the forums - I don&#039;t have time to check every single buyer out before selling especially if their stats are good. And yes I can out them on here on the forums but after they ruin the feedback I&#039;ve busted my ass to earn. And I know there is an SR vendor group but I have no idea what goes on in there because I&#039;ve been waiting SIX WEEKS for group membership approval.<br /><br />I know you can make the argument that vendors might say something personal about the buyer (name and address) and the buyer is at risk. However that argument is invalid - if the vendor leaves feedback after finalization and is following SR procedure and deleting the contact info once confirmed then this is a nonissue. Vendors who don&#039;t follow procedure and leave those types of messages or keep contact info should be banned and comment removed. Plus, the buyers know our shipping methods and some info about us from their packages - they could put that in feedback so why are they given the trust and vendors are not?<br /><br />In its simplest form, why can&#039;t there just be a rating system that vendors can give to buyers after they finalize 1-5 in checkbox form (examples:1-don&#039;t sell to this person, 2-sell at our own risk, had problems, 5-excellent buyer) - that way we can have more info on the buyers before deciding to sell to them. If I saw someone with 40 transactions and the last five were #1&#039;s (being don&#039;t sell to this person) - I would cancel their order and not waste my time or money.<br /><br />Please, other vendors, some input here would be great.
