				Why does it take sooo long for the coins to reach SR from mtgox? One time it took 3 hours for my btc to be transferred from mtgox to my SR account, I ended up having to add more money to SR which took an additional 3 hours. Is there anyway they can speed up the process of transfers? Is there a faster way to get my BTC to my account?

				As a general rule, always send $10-$20 dollars over what you plan to spend to account for BTC fluctuation.<br />On another note, if you are sending your BTC straight from mtgox you have a major security problem, at least in my opinion.

I normally go with instawallets. <br />Torify a desktop botcoin client and send the mtgox bitcoins to there. Then break them up and send them to a few different instawallets, and then send those instawallet coins to a few more. Then to SR.<br />Tips:<br />Get a new address each time you send coins to an instawallet from your bitcoin wallet. <br />Make a new SR BTC address each time you want to send it coins.<br />Access each instawallet with a new tor identity.

				ah okay, thanks!<br /><br />and also, i swear... the value of coins change more when value on the BTC is going down. I&#039;ve been watching the values on coins for the past 4 hours and SR changes more frequently when price goes down.

				I understand that sending from mtgox may not be the most secure, but for a transaction as a small purchaser - is it really anything to worry about (serious question).<br /><br />I am new and have found the buyer I want to get some stuff from.&nbsp; Small amount, but it seems to be getting more and more complicated!

				Hey, I apologize if this is a dumb question but does anybody know if there is a way for Mt. Gox or anyone else for that matter to know where you are sending your BTC?? I mean, what makes your address on SR exclusive or different than one in an insta-wallet and how would say LE be able to find this out or connect the BTC address with SR? Thanks to anyone who has the answer.

				My only problem with SR btc vendors is they charge you a high interest rate. While other reputable vendors may charge only 5%.

With that you erase one link form btc transfer path and you are pretty safe.<br />Its not worry what btc exchange has your btc addresses, important is that they can not connect you with btc addresses, even SR goes down there is no way that they can find owner of that address if you delete btc add between transfers.<br /><br />Anyhow, even SR is compromised and you are sending btc from MtGox to SR directly, LE would have hard time proving that you know to whom you re sending funds, or who is the btc address owner. Just because you are sending btc coins &quot;somewhere&quot; it does not mean that you are aware &quot;where&quot; you are sending or who is the recipient (that is the whole point of btc currency).<br />.And I would see judge who would understand all that bitcoin &quot;thing&quot;. Remember, you dont have to explain anything, that is their job.

So if SR gets compromised, it would be possible to link your SR account to your mt.gox account. I&#039;d really recommend to put a couple of layers between the open Internet and SR, to make sure it&#039;s near impossible to trace anything back to you (or, if someone does, you can make it plausible you weren&#039;t involved in the illegal bits).

				/\ say hi to Crow and Tom for me!<br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;ve made more than I&#039;ve lost with BTC. werer2.25 when I started. But were up to $25-30 at one point I heard? I just hate seeing the value drop after paying a vendor. From now on,if its a vendor I trust and have used a lot, and the value raises alot, I&#039;ll just go ahead and release it early, so they can possibly withdraw and get some extra. (although I&#039;m not really sure how/when vendors get $$ from BTC)
