				I orderd from someone monday and they said if i put in the order fasy enough it would go out monday. So i did. I later msg him asking did it go out. He replys and says &quot;Its out&quot; So i wait a few hours and check the order and it still says processing . I msg him asking whats the deal and he then says he missed me but would ship it tomorrow express(Meaning yesterday) out his own pocket. Well today is now Wen and its yet to be marked in transit and on top of that he msgs me saying what express offer after i thanked him for it, so im confused wtf is going on.

				Sounds like the vendor is an amateur.&nbsp; Most large established vendors would either not respond (but still send your item, just maybe a little late), or they would actually try to help you out, by shipping Express like this vendor said they would.&nbsp; However, many vendors will prepare their orders, then go out and ship them covertly, then come back and mark them in transit.&nbsp; But, with the amount of time that has passed, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what&#039;s happening here.<br /><br />Of course, without knowing who the vendor is, it&#039;s difficult to say what&#039;s really going on.&nbsp; This is why we stay in escrow, yeah?

				Wow. Sounds like a shitty vendor to me, if it&#039;s happening like you say. I&#039;m sorry, I couldn&#039;t begin to predict what that dude is doing.

				if you h\ave any doubts on a vendor , their are a lot of good hard working vendors who work to get customers, and will go the extra mile for your business. if its still not marked in transit you can cancel and order from a vendor&nbsp; who wants and can give you customer service. i don&#039;t know what you are looking for but give my site a try.&nbsp; canadiandrugs

				He msg me yesterday and explained some small issue he had. He&#039;s a well known Vendor specially for his shipping. He msg me yesterday and said he was gonna send me Xtra of the product and express it. It&#039;s still yet to say In Transit though. Hopefully by now its been sent at least. I msg again to ask if there was any hold ups again im waiting on a response.
