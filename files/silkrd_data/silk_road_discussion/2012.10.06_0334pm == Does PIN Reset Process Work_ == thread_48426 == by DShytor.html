				Does anybody know how exactly this pin reset process really works? There is an entire page in the SR Wiki on this pin but it explains absolutely nothing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve made my 5 failed guesses and received the PIN reset email from SRS. It has been sitting in my inbox unopened for 8 days. For the first few days I went crazy thinking something was wrong with that message because I couldn&#039;t open it, even though I could open other mail. Then I saw a post on this forum implying that I wouldn&#039;t be able to open it until 7*24 hours after it arrived. Well it is now over that number of hours; my inbox says the message&#039;s freshness is &quot;8 days&quot; but I still cannot open the message, never mind reply to it.<br /><br />I have a buncha bc&#039;s locked up here now and it&#039;s very frustrating to not be able to do anything with them. This is driving me crazy over here. Anybody know what I should do? Is this normal behavior or do I need to contact SR Support?<br /><br />:-(<br />DS

It&#039;s in case your account has been compromised, and someone else is attempting to empty your wallet. Assuming any identifying information may be compromised with your account, the one thing Support can do is give you a week to find out that someone else locked your PIN and message them that it wasn&#039;t you, before they can take your money.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You should be able to open messages once you receive them, there is no facility for &#039;timelocking&#039; a message.

				I will take your advice and contact SR Support. The procedures didn&#039;t work for me; I could never open the email (and therefore could not reply to it). In my inbox, every email message has a &quot;Read&quot; link with a hexadecimal message number embedded in the link&#039;s URL, except for the PIN Reset email which just has the URL &quot;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/messages/message/&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I saw another posting on one of these forums that suggested this was normal but your post indicates that it&#039;s not normal. Thank you for clearing that up.<br /><br />Cheers<br />DShytor<br /><br />

				I realize this has probably been settled, but for others who might be referencing this conversation, it seems the wait time was changed from 7 days to 3:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35926.msg409803#msg409803">Quote from: squidShepherd on August 15, 2012, 08:13 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">UPDATE: PIN reset period is now 3 days instead of 1 week!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The Infamous PIN<br /><br />Support gets more PIN related messages than anything else.

				Ok if they really lowered the time to 3 days then that&#039;s a help. It took me nine days, because to make sure you waited the full 7 days (or risk further delay!!) you had to wait 8, and then it took another day to actually get the email saying log out and in to get re-prompted for the pin. Also, I was never able to reply to the email; I had to spoof a reply by cutting and pasting the subject of the pin message into a new email. That seemed to work (but as I said it took a day).<br /><br />This whole pin thing is messed up; the pin is not even really a pin which was the source of my confusion to begin with. It&#039;s just a separate password for withdrawing. PIN is an acronym that stands for personal identification number and it is a numeric code, except here on SR apparently where it&#039;s just a second authentication password. If&nbsp; there had been any clue at all that it was a password I would have remembered the right one, which is in fact what happened when reading these forums and seeing someone else mention that it&#039;s a password not a pin. Then the whole thing came back to me; how it originally was a pin, then they made it a password and I had to change it again. As an occasional shopper on the Road I found the whole process extremely frustrating, but not as frustrating as the admins will find it as pin resets are going to consume their lives. It&#039;s inevitable given the design. I understand the need for security but this pin thing has not been thought out. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DShytor
