				So I&#039;ve seen a few offers from pretty reputable vendors requesting loans that yield anything from 12% after 6 weeks to 40% within a week.<br /><br />Usually if something seems too good to be true it invariably is but there seems to be alot of positive feedback and reasonable uptake.<br /><br />Does anyone know or could they direct me to the legality of these things, i.e. if I dont ask questions and the project being undertaken with my funds turns out to be illegal am I in anyway responsible?<br /><br />It seems weird to me that people with large volumes of sales are requiring small cash injections, but then I suppose they add up and can help with larger projects which they could not fund through other (non-anonymous) channels.<br /><br />All thoughts / feedback / anecdotes welcome.<br /><br />Hope this is the right place for this thread if not mods could you send it to where it belongs.

				I can only speak on a few months of experience, but if you have the money, and the vendor looks trustworthy (they&#039;ve been around for a good amount of time), I&#039;d say go for it. Although there&#039;s probably a few other people who would disagree with me vehemently. Your choice in the end.

I offer an investment program myself which guarantees to return your principal i.e your original investment plus 6% after 30 days.<br /><br />Although some of my initial capital was obtained from more dubious ventures, I now only invest in ethical and legal ventures. I keep this separate from my Bitcoin trading business as I hope to do this on a more full time basis in future.<br /><br />Feel free to take a peek at my listing for this on SR:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/23cd2cd838<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

				I believe loaning out BTC is solely up to the owner of the wallet. :)<br /><br />If you trust the person you&#039;re giving the coins to and you&#039;re sure they&#039;ll return them, then go for it.<br /><br />NOT TO MENTION.. a reputable vendor with a loan listing.<br />They are probably full out business men/women.<br /><br />Either way. :D<br />Enjoy your day!

				bump<br /><br />fwiw I went with a trusted well reviewed seller who paid me early but at the full % return and as per agreed (tied to USD)<br /><br />having been busy over the past few days it was pretty pleasing to see that along with getting paid early bitcoins have taken a pretty nice price increase since then as well, but i guess that could ve swung either way.<br /><br />anyone who has a good bitcoin tracking / market movement monitoring site to recommend would be much appreciated<br /><br />

				12-40% / week ===&gt; HYIP<br /><br />12% / week == 36152% / year (compounding). <br /><br />That&#039;s even higher then PPTs, totally ridiculous.<br />Ponzi&#039;s are looking very nice...&quot;just like in Paradise&quot;....<br />...untill abruptly, you loose everything. <br /><br />
