				I reinstalled my Tor browser and couldn&#039;t find the silk toad url, so I went to a hidden wiki mirror to find it.<br /><br />I got to the page and saw the same normal login, except with a &quot;PIN&quot; field , apparently for extra security.<br />After typing in my credentials 3 times and not being able to login, I looked at the URL and it wasn&#039;t the normal URL.<br />I looked for the silkroad url I was familiar with and logged in with no problem (and without a &quot;PIN&quot;) field. <br />I went into my account settings and changed my password and PIN right away.<br /><br />Hopefully this will keep me safe :\<br /><br />Just a friendly reminder to check your URL, and change your password and PIN on a regular basis!

				Nice quick thinking. It&#039;s a shame how much this happens and how easy of a scam it is to pull. Always keep the site&#039;s URL bookmarked (or some other form of easy access) just in case.<br /><br />

				It is a well-known fact that the hidden wiki provides a fake link and using it will get you phished.

				I don&#039;t know exactly how everything here works, but I&#039;m sure there would be absolutely no reason for SR to ask for your PIN when logging in. Your PIN is solely used as an extra security measure before sending money away from your account, just to make sure you are who you say you are. If you are asked to type in&nbsp; your PIN to log in to SR, you are probably on the wrong website.<br /><br />I personally take care of this problem by memorizing the URL to Silk Road. This is probably better than saving it in my computer anyways, just in case the authorities get a hold of my computer.

It is a new browser, so you start again. A good tip is to load the old version, copy the URLs, and transfer them to Word, paste them into your new browser, and you&#039;re done in 10 minutes in time for a cheeky little Bacardi. It is rare SR will ask you for your PIN too, advice seems sound.

				you can backup your bookmarks before you uninstall old TBB and import them after you install the new TBB<br /><br /><br />While the Tor browser is open: <br /><br />press Ctrl-Shift-B (or click the Bookmarks menu, then click Show All Bookmarks)<br /><br />click &#039;Import and Backup&#039;, click &#039;Backup&#039; to save your bookmarks to a familiar location.<br /><br />click &#039;Restore &gt; Choose File&#039; to reload the bookmarks back into Tor browser.

				Does anyone know if silkroadvb5piz2r instead of 3r a scamming site or is it a shadow/backup server for SR? It tried to get me to sign in on it a couple of weeks ago when SR was having problems.
