				Why do you have a hate hard-on for Silk Road? I have only read the latest article, and didn&#039;t feel the need to read your 1st one. But, I am still curious why you hate Silk Road so much? <br />The last article was in complete contempt that guns were being offered for sale. So fucking what? There are guns for sale all over the planet. Haven&#039;t you seen The Vice Guide To Everything? In one episode, they go to Khyber Pass, and show you how 1,000,000 guns a year are made there, and sold dirt cheap. That&#039;s just one small village in the Afghan mountains.....1,000,000 guns per year. For 60 years. And you&#039;re worried about 10 guns being sold online??? Fucking SERIOUSLY??? <br />Why aren&#039;t you writing articles on contract killers? http://iacgq6y2j2nfudy7.onion/ &amp; http://2v3o2fpukdlpk5nf.onion/<br />Maybe because those are obvious scams?? <br /><br />How about BABY KILLERS??!!?? Interested in stopping that, Mr. Gawker? Why haven&#039;t you done an extensive article, calling for global police force to stop this insane shit?!? http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/experiments/<br />They apparently murder everyone, but seem to take joy from injecting bleach into the bellies of pregnant women. Where&#039;s the Gawker article calling for the quick intervention by some law agency???? <br /><br />There are a slew of other such atrocities, such as CP, and shit. Why do you give such a fuck about a bunch of nerdy drug users? <br />Seriously. I want your full modus operandi on this. You&#039;re one man crusade against Silk Road must have an underlying origin? Or is it right on top? Do you write articles about the drug dealers in your neighborhood? Oh, they&#039;re there....trust me. <br /><br />I&#039;m really extremely surprised that someone has not attacked Gawker....say, like Anonymous....or even a group with a 10th of their knowledge. Why hasn&#039;t anyone fucked back with these&nbsp; people?? <br />I&#039;ll tell you why....peace. That&#039;s right. 98% of SR travelers, even those on&nbsp; &quot;hard&quot; drugs, are mostly about peace. That&#039;s why they are here. Many of them have to brave ghettos, gangs, WARZONES, &amp; military, just to catch a nice buzz, and end the day with a smile. <br />I didn&#039;t even know what gawker was until all these threads a couple weeks back. and I hope it gets attacked. Anonymous shut down multiple police agencies a few days ago...and even sent nasty texts through their cell phones.....quite entertaining. Would be entertaining to see asswads like you get the same treatment. <br />I&#039;m even tempted to start a pool, to get a drug induced nerd to DDoS you guys. <br /><br />What&#039;s your motivation?<br />Why Silk Road, and not the slew of other drug sites? <br />Why not murderers?

				Personally I think it is a good thing for the vendors. The only concern I have is that it did cause a couple Congressmen to get uppity, but so far that has not developed into any kind of a threat. I have faith in SR!

				Hhhmm. I see a few of you only found out about&nbsp; SR *because* of the article. I wonder then, how did you find out about drugs? It wasn&#039;t from word of mouth? Was it another form of media? <br />I also found SR because of an article....but the one I read, had nothing but praise for the site. <br /><br />My questions though, are still why SR, and not some other fucked up site? <br />Also curious how this person found&nbsp; out about SR??? Who told gawker guy? It&#039;s not like it enters everyday conversation....unless, of course....you&#039;re a drug addict.

				I like to think that gawker had a stake in BTC and was possibly an SR user(maybe disgruntled). maybe he thought it was possible to raise the price of BTC by advertising SR to the mass media making himself richer. Who knows though..........

				dude that medical site is fucked up, and i want to say that it&#039;s some sort of sick joke, esp since the site gets nothing accomplished, but you never know.<br /><br />anyway: to answer SD&#039;s questions, the little gawker pussy is just a wannabe journalist with an insignificant prick. he has no chance of ever becoming a great journalist, as is evident by his writing, and in some sort of desperate last stab attempt to try and get as much of anything as he can, he resorts to sensationalist bullshit, like the loser news reporters from bumfuck nowhere that figure &quot;hell, i&#039;ll never be seen as a worthwhile journalist, nor get any sort of actual job witha&nbsp; reputable network, so why should i bother to report the real news, or, LORD FORBID, do some actual journalism/research and report FACTUAL news that is for everyone&#039;s benefit, when instead i can make a sensationalist fiasco out of the next rand topic that seems to come up.&quot;<br /><br />did that make any sense?

The most interesting and best time I have ever had in school, with the exception of the excision of a brain and primary neural cell culture, was when we learned about drugs... with all those wonderful programs intended to educate and suppress use. This was at a time before I had a computer or the internet and hardly knew jack shit about drugs beyond pot. Thankfully they came in with stories of amusement and excitement, and obvious lies of people dying from pot and other BS fear propaganda kids arent even stupid enough to buy. Handing out extensive checklists of experiences for me to accomplish.

I&#039;m glad there throwing a wrench into the corporate gears^,..,^ doesn&#039;t Gawger have something better to do like report on how Apple products exploit millions of children and others worldwide, or how the internet is under constant surveillance by HLS and the FBI. Drugs are a victimless crime if no guns or violence or greed is involved. nothing personal gawker but fuck off already and quit picking the low hanging fruit.....long live Anonymous...long live the SR

The most interesting and best time I have ever had in school, with the exception of the excision of a brain and primary neural cell culture, was when we learned about drugs... with all those wonderful programs intended to educate and suppress use. This was at a time before I had a computer or the internet and hardly knew jack shit about drugs beyond pot.
