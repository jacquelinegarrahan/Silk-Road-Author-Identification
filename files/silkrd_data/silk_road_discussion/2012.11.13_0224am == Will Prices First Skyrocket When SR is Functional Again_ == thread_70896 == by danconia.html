				Let&#039;s see here.&nbsp; Supply may have slightly gone up if some sellers have the cash flow and were waiting for their packages to come in BUT demand is certainly accumulating and lots of buyers will be itching to make up for lost time.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to say yes, prices may go up quite a bit for the first few days or so once we&#039;re back online.&nbsp; Which sucks because I need my next batch but don&#039;t want to break the bank.&nbsp; I feel bad for the vendors who are going to have to try to catch up with all of their orders but perhaps this will be a silver lining.<br /><br />And yes I realize some may have kept them down until seeing this.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Cat&#039;s out of the bag.&nbsp; Heck even the increased risk of vendors losing tons of money in escrow may push them to jack up the prices.&nbsp;

				Most reputable vendors will keep the prices the same. Im sure there will be an influx of orders when its back up, dont see why vendors would be worried.<br />:)

				I doubt it.&nbsp; There is quite a premium on SR prices but that mostly has to do with cost of business here. Actual product prices are largely a function of forces outside of SR. This moment should not affect pricing since nearly all variables are the same. <br /><br />Personally, I would do the opposite if other vendors raised prices since this downtime didn&#039;t do anything to me but create a thirst to make more sales. <br /><br />What is interesting is to see the effect on bitcoin prices.&nbsp; Theoretically, bitcoin value could sink in the days following SR&#039;s revival. This would be due to vendors looking to convert any coin immediately after the downtime; a kneejerk reaction to all the uncertainty.&nbsp; However, that&#039;s assuming a lot.&nbsp; Whatever the bitcoin reaction is, it will normalize quickly.&nbsp; In bitcoin time, that could be a matter of hours.

				Why buy from a douche that creates a false inflation of prices when you can buy from a vendor that isn&#039;t jacking up prices (Which I doubt they will). Even if people have been waiting, they will still have to wait to receive a package regardless if they have been waiting since Friday.

				Let&#039;s hope the vendors are willing to sell again, after having to wait so long for their money some might have gone out of business
