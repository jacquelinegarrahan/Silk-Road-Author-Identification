				It&#039;s been processing since Friday, and I&#039;ve found somebody who&#039;s selling it for a lot cheaper. The guy is reputable, but he&#039;s so slow. Will I get in trouble for doing this? If it was in transit, it&#039;d be a different story, but it&#039;s processing and I don&#039;t feel like waiting 2-3 weeks for something somebody else can get here in 1.

				Thats why I feel sellers should stick to a policy, rather than using the &#039;in transit&#039; status as a personal marker of progress regarding their overall business. It seems to mean different things to different vendors. If you cancel an order after its been sent, thats called stealing. Which is why it&#039;d be nice to know every vendor is on the same policy. If the order doesn&#039;t say &#039;in transit&#039; yet and you are able to cancel, that really isn&#039;t wrong. Rude perhaps,but not wrong. Don&#039;t you have to wait 4 days before you can cancel? I&#039;ve never had an order sit that long without changing status. If the vendors terms on his page and item listings say specifically that it may take over 4 days before shipped, then I wouldn&#039;t cancel. Otherwise I might consider it.

				If you have a cancel button, then the vendor either gave you the option, or is taking too long.<br /><br />Go ahead, and cancel.

				Can I get a negative feedback for canceling, though? As a new buyer, getting negative feedback would ruin me and nobody would want to sell to me.

				The vendor know you have the cancel button active, he is giving you the option.<br />Would be better to PM each other.<br />But hey vendor shows me a cancel button I use it, unless it&#039;s a VGV, lol.<br /><br />I&#039;ve cancel a few orders, with no effects on rating. Who lost?

				I&#039;ve cancelled once after a day or two of waiting after cancel became an option, it was a reputable vendor but known to run out and have to wait for re-up.&nbsp; I hope it does affect me because I&#039;d love to order from him in the future!
