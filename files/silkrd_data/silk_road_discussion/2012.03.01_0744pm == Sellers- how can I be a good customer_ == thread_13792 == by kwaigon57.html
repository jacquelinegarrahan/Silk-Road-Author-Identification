				I&#039;m as interested in my reputation as a buyer as my favorite sellers are in their respective reps. <br />I suppose it&#039;s mostly common sense, but if any sellers would like to comment on what makes a <br />good buyer, a person who they enjoy doing business with, I&#039;d like to hear it. <br />I want the sellers I interact with the most to have a favorable opinion of me because 1) they do a<br />great job on their end and 2) if anything happens to SR, or they decide to scale down business I want<br />to be one of their preferred customers.<br /><br />I really appreciate the pros like Pharmville and many others, who are just a pleasure to do business with.<br /><br />Best regards to all,<br />KG<br /><br />

				I was thinking along these lines perhaps we can get a &quot;buyer rating&quot; in the future. <br />I guess sellers look at our stats to get a general idea, but it might help them to see comments.<br /><br />thanks to you all. i love this community. if we work together we will keep scammers and other sleaze out.<br />

				Buyer ratings do seem like something that would be really helpful. In my circumstance, and im sure im not alone here, I am brand new with no transactions. I tried to place my first order and it was cancelled. My account now shows a refund which does not look good to other sellers. However the refund is only because of the fact that I am so new the seller did not want to take the chance. If there was a buyer rating/comment system, it could be explained that I was new, and not that I was a hassle and wanted a refund. Oh well though hopefully one of my two processing orders will go through so I can get a positive transaction under my belt.

Sellers put their reputations on the line with each transaction, why shouldn&#039;t the buyer be accountable and receive a good review for paying early, leaving timely ratings, etc. I think this would give established sellers confidence in taking on new customers and keeping a remaining loyalty to their established ones as well. I finalized early with one established seller just recently and the PM response was &quot;thank you for trusting and doing so, you&#039;d be surprised how many people take days to actual fill, respond or finalize an order&quot;. My package will be in tomorrow. <br /><br />I know I&#039;m still new and this is just my 2cs however I&#039;ve been around long enough to know how to play the game. <br />

				so far i have never had a problem with a vendor. the best thing to do is place order, dont email checking on it unless it is a few weeks over due, then right when u get it finalize and write n honest review.&nbsp; If there are hiccups, go to the vendor first to try to figure it out, most will make this very easy.They are busy so the easier you make it on them the better.

Take note of the auto finalize date and offer a time extension to the seller just before it expires.

				Nice idea! Like the suspicious buyers thread it would keep sellers as a whole safer too because everyone on here would have a reputation to uphold. And it would give the staff at SR more insight when they have to solve problems between vendors and buyers. SR has a great community as far as I&#039;ve seen, I like how everyone comes together and looks out for one another. <br /><br />-Good looks everyone-

				If buyers had rep, I can see buyers rating a seller low on the next order with them out of vengeance if a seller were to give them a less than 5 rating. I think this could turn out to be a big mess for seller ratings.

So if a buyer gets pissed at a vendor for giving him a low rating, he can go back and switch his feedback to 1/5. This possibility needs to be addressed if a buyer feedback system is implemented.

				Something as simple as a PM to order ratio would probably -very- helpful to vendors, without hurting anyone&#039;s feelings. (PMs sent per order placed, total # of sent PMs, something like that)

				Finalize promptly<br />Give periodic feedback / recs on the forums to spread the word<br />Provide direct feedback if anything can be better<br />Be patient with orders and communication (mail does get hung up sometimes, and just managing emails can take a lot of time.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Remember that we do our best, but were are just one-person shops with other jobs / lives / families / etc. and that life happens.

				Damn good thread!!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <br /><br />READ A VENDORS PROFILE BEFORE FIRST CONTACT. Read it twice. Look for the answers to your questions before asking. Be patient and courteous. RELAX. Sh*t happens from time to time. YES, EVEN WITH SUPERSTAR CHAMPIONS LIKE MYSELF. Do NOT jump straight to the forums. EVEN IF you do not have a favorable experience give the vendor a chance to make it right or better. TRY to handle your business behind closed doors, first. Clear communication and a willingness to work though a problem is key.<br /><br />&nbsp;Demanding and being an idiot will get you nothing....

I can point to dozens of instances where it may have looked like that but the vendor just made a mistake and they are almost invariably willing to fix it up at the first request. <br /><br />Keep in mind in most cases you are buying from someone a lot like you. This Ain&#039;t Amazon. You probably wouldn&#039;t be able to make 0 mistakes either. Superstar Champions (heh) do make mistakes. But what makes a true Superstar Champion is that they learn from the mistakes, make up with their customer, and move on. <br /><br />For the most part, though, the transactions go very smoothly, especially considering that you are on the internet getting this stuff brought to your home. <br /><br />Beats Actual Human Contact, dun&#039;nit? :-D
