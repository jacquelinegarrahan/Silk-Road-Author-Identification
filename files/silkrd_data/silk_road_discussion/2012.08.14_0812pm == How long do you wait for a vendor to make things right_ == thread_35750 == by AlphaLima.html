				I know, I know....Don&#039;t FE!! Not ever, ever, ever. And I will never, ever, ever do it again! This guy requested I do because I only had 6 perfect transactions. Before I did I read all his feedback, read the reviews on the threads. Everything seemed fine and I FEd.<br /><br />Needless to say, nothing has shown up. I messaged him after 5 days to see where my stuff was. It&#039;ll be there tomorrow or the next day. Nothing. After another 4 days, I messaged, nothing is here. It took him a while to read the message and he claims he&#039;ll make it right, get back to him right away. Which I did.<br /><br />Nothing. He hasn&#039;t responded to my message. I know things go wrong, mail gets lost. But I&#039;ve ordered from 4 different vendors here all have been stellar. Not one has gone south. And I didn&#039;t FE any of those. Coincidence?? I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />I want to change the feedback to 1, but since I&#039;m not sure, how long do I give the vendor?

				Tell him you are going to put it to a 1/5 since nothing has shown up, if he offers a re send or some resolution, wait till it comes in and then you can go back and edit the feedback accordingly.

				If your order doesn&#039;t show up and vendor can&#039;t prove that he shipped... Looks like you got selectively scammed and the vendor is just stringing you along. Post an honest review ASAP and give proper feedback before it gets buried :)

				Thanks. I guess I&#039;ve been super spoiled by the phenomenal vendors I&#039;ve done business with. If he doesn&#039;t like the 1/5, then he can ship my product. A day later, still no answer to my message. Seems like selective scamming to me! <br /><br />At least I know who to avoid and I still have 4 great vendors to deal with. I just want to save someone else from his shenanigans.

				Who is the vendor- Name and Shame- that&#039;s the Game and how to tame Shamous and Jane. Fuck me- I&#039;m a poet!<br />Seriously though, it&#039;s always good to know who to avoid!

				How long you wait depends on your individual patience level. I would advise from my limited experience here that trying to have infinite patience with a vendor has gotten me nowhere. <br /><br />Unfortunately if you went ahead with FE there is not a whole lot or recourse for you.&nbsp; :(

				I&#039;d like to know the name of the vendor so I know not to ever buy anything from them

				Amazing....I changed the feedback to 1/5 and still haven&#039;t heard from &quot;them&quot;.<br /><br />T4B - Somehow I just knew when I hit finalize I was kissing my BC goodbye. So much for doing my homework!! All I can do is share with all the posters that are thinking about FE. Don&#039;t do it!! I&#039;ll never stray from my tried and true vendors again!<br /><br /><br /><br />
