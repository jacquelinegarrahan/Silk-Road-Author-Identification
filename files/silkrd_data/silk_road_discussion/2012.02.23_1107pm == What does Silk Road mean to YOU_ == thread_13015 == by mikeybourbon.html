				I know there have been threads like these in the past but I am curious to what people are &quot;getting&quot; out of the site.&nbsp; Surely, people are getting an easier way to obtain drugs but I feel/hope it should be&nbsp; a little more than that.&nbsp; Personally, I use Silk Road for the &#039;goodies&#039;.&nbsp; But I also love the feeling of being a part of revolution of some sorts that is truly unique.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to hear your thoughts/opinions!&nbsp; Thanks!!!!

				Being a part of SR means a few things to me. First off I feel like we are proving a point to the drug war. Responsible use of drugs is possible, and not only that but when drug &quot;dealers&quot; are entered into a free market quality of product goes up to compete with the other people and you see less injuries and deaths.<br />Another thing I enjoy being a part of is instructing people on computer and network security. I feel computer security is going to be a MUST in the next decade, and learning all you can is essential.

				I kind of like the fact that it is a little secretive.&nbsp; Feels like a community...though I know we are not all friends or anything.<br /><br />I like the fact that feedback means quality is promoted and the forum means that advice can be found from people and there are many willing to give out advice you wouldn&#039;t get on the normal internet sites.<br /><br />I am not into the political anti establishment thing - just the community thing.<br /><br />I like using encrypted messages as I feel like James Bond.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just need the Aston Martin now.

				You can find my edibles in clinics out here in Cali but I want people from all over the US to give them a try. I try my best to make them extremely high quality because I truly believe they are medicine! Plus I always get excited to check out my new reviews when people post them&nbsp; :)

				This might sound weird, but I feel like the Silk Road is almost a good example of what the world would be like if drugs were just all legal. I mean you have no idea how much time I&#039;ve bought supposed &quot;molly,&quot; and instead it was fake shit that either put me to sleep or didn&#039;t make me roll at all. But because the stuff here is reviewed and tested by trusted members, I no longer have to worry. I now get the best molly in the world sent right to my house with no problems. It&#039;s also far cheaper due to competition on the site. It&#039;s really a safe haven for responsible drug users like myself. The same goes for any drug I get here, be it mushrooms or acid or whatever. The quality and safety is guaranteed, and the same can&#039;t be said for some guy I meet at a local party whose cousin claims to sell good drugs or some bullshit. Thanks for the awesome community vendors.

				Silk Road is awesome. I&#039;m a tad new here (obviously), but I like this website. Just the very possibility that I&#039;m able to obtain drugs easily and with minimal human interaction is incredibly awesome. Add in the self-regulated quality of product and the simplicity of using the website (well, simple once you pass the initial learning curve) and you&#039;ve got something I&#039;d kill to have forever.

				I just joined here today, after being invited by a friend of mine, and I have to say that I&#039;m really inspired by all of the well-written responses in this thread. I initially thought of SR as just another marketplace, but after reading this thread, I got a much better sense of the social change that SR and organizations like it are incrementally pushing along. Little by little, no matter how the press and the governments smear and mudsling, SR is proving to the world that there can be a safe and regulated method of &quot;illicit&quot; transactions - keeping people away from bad neighborhoods and fake, adulterated substances.<br /><br />This thread should be stickied.

Prohibition created a dark, scary mob run rule for years, in many cases its proposed alcohol consumption went up not down (very hard to accurately judge because sale isn&#039;t tracked). Why must we repeat the same fucking retarded ideal while scratching our heads going &quot;Well, it didnt work for alcohol, but maybe it&#039;ll work for &lt;Drug Name Goes Here&gt;&quot;.

				When i first started digging around the webz for SR, I was excited to find a place I could find pure MDMA and MDA, and good LSD. I was simply looking for a place to get drugs I couldnt find anymore in real life. <br /><br />But in my short time being here it&#039;s become more. I spend a lot of time on forums (specifically drug ones) and SR forums are by far my favorite. The community thats been growing here is really cool, I think its because we&#039;re all giving the finger to our nations drug policies. <br /><br /><br /><br />And as someone else mentioned on here, receiving goodies in the mail is just so exciting!

				I really like silk road a lot.<br /><br />Somehow I was one of the first hundred members here, so I&#039;ve been watching behind the scenes since this whole thing was launched.<br /><br />Silk road to me is the perfect merchant idea for acquiring drugs. Its great because I can browse the listings on my own accord and don&#039;t have to worry about turning down a dealer because their quality isnt up to my standards (a lot of dealers take harsh offense when you turn down their stuff because you think it isn&#039;t good enough). Also, it just cuts out the whole annoying part of having to hinker-dink around with dealers you don&#039;t really know or trust.<br /><br />Quality is a very important aspect of drugs to me especially with psychedelics and marijuana. Silk road has provided me with a much greater &amp; consistent selection of high quality goods compared to my local hookups.<br /><br />Usually SR prices are a bit higher than locally, but SR quality always beats the street where I am.<br /><br />

				What does it mean to me?<br /><br />It means quality, peer reviewed product that is almost certain to be what it is said to be, if well researched.<br /><br />It means not feeling unsafe and afraid for my life every time I have to meet with somebody that a friend &quot;met at a party and is totally legit&quot;.<br /><br />It means dealing with people who, for the most part, genuinely have my interests at heart. Sure, profit is the reason they&#039;re here, but their reputation means a lot more when it is so easily evaluated.<br /><br />It means being a part of a community of like-minded individuals that understand how skewed the worlds perspective is on drugs. They understand and want it to be a safer place for everyone involved to be able to purchase and sell substances that others outside the community generally do not understand.&nbsp; <br /><br />And perhaps most importantly, it means change. Archaic laws need no longer be relevant, and I believe a community such as this one (and I&#039;m sure DPR does also) is exactly what the world needs to demonstrate this.

				SR has meant me having the best 2011, and now 2012, I could ever want! SR has given me so much inspiration, ideas, optimism, and excitement, you don&#039;t even know!<br /><br />I hate like no other when I hear about weed dealers who don&#039;t even know the name of the strain their selling, much less describe its best uses. No wonder drug dealers were considered the scum of Earth for so long, they didn&#039;t EARN the respect! Marijuana especially, it&#039;s such a beautiful plant with so much potential, yet was co-opted and hijacked by sinister forces for no good reason. It&#039;s the most fucked over substance in history, it pains me every time I think about it. If one deal&#039;s weed, they should love the thing they sell, market it so people get excited about it. Drug dealers who deal for the money only need to fuck off, and fast!<br /><br />Lastly, even though I started using crystal meth before SR, buying it via Silk Road has shown me the power and beauty of meth made cleanly.&nbsp; I wish people would stop dumping on crystal meth, it&#039;s not a death wish for everyone. Brush your teeth, eat, sleep, and 85% of crystal meth problems are eliminated. It&#039;s not a dirty, redneck drug, it&#039;s actually very safe, and very hard -- if not impossible -- to overdose on. Also, I can eat ANYTHING I want whenever and never gain a pound. Only people ruining their lives are retards, and slammers. Most slammers mix meth with heroin, never own scales, dirty needles...and they wonder why they died?<br /><br />Lol. SR, I owe my happiness to you!<br /><br />P.S. See, even after 2 years of regular meth usage, I still feel happiness! I stopped listening to the government, DARE, Dr. Drew, &quot;Save the Children&quot; people, etc. on anything regarding the topic of drugs -- they&#039;ve lost all credibility, and are wrong about so much. Even bath salts are not bad for you it seems (definite MDPV fans around), long as proper dosage is followed. :)

				I found silk road, after I was shaking my head saying &quot;Theres got to be a better way&quot;<br /><br />I rarely party anymore at age 32 (not the case when I was 22)... A few weeks before I found this place, I was planning a party.&nbsp; All I wanted was 2grams of MDMA or even xtc pills.&nbsp; I asked my friends and locals, but nobody could come through.&nbsp; In the end I called up a crazy friend of mine who is young and into alot of shit.. So I was sent by her to a connect..<br /><br />This experience was going into a shitty trailerpark, and visiting some shady people who had been up all night (and probably several for who knows how long) getting fucked up on meth and coke.&nbsp; I got my shit.. but in the end.. I said to myself &quot;Im too old for this shit&quot;.. sure in my heyday, hanging out with shady fucked up street dealers in trailer parks... that was part of my life. no big deal... 10 yrs later, as an adult, owning my own house, with a solid job, and just wanting to relax every once and a while and party with some close friends... yeah I dont want anything to do with that scene.&nbsp; I dont need to be around it.. and as a former Meth head, its not good for me to be in that scene.<br /><br />So here I am.. very happy that from the comfort of my bedroom I can get what I want for a fun time without having to deal with these types of scenerios ever again (at least thats my hope)<br />

				The collective unconscious. When I have my time and it all comes around and I sit down. It&#039;s all right there. I really understand my mind a lot more way and it empowers me. I have such a feeling of freedom, of self worth and dignity.

				It’s convenient for those whose obedience is rewarded with financial stability and social status to moralize about playing by the rules. When they insist that peaceful, law-abiding protest is the only acceptable <br />option, you HAVE to ask: are they capable of honestly considering anything else?<br /><br /><br /><br />There have always been people who consider the law of the land more important than the dictates of conscience. They hanged John Brown for treason; they looked the other way as Jews were carted off to Dachau People are locked up for growing a flower everyday; they think statutes and property rights are more precious than rainforests, polar icecaps, or native peoples rights. In abdicating the responsibility to determine right and wrong for themselves, they elevate the Nuremberg defense to a moral principle—a principle they’re not afraid to force on others with nightsticks,tear gas and prison.<br /><br />ONLY those who are willing to break the law can be trusted to do what they truly believe is right. In stepping &quot;out of line&quot; they prove that they are not acting solely out of cowardice, obedience, or conformity. They may make mistakes, they may have questionable motives, but they NEVER make the excuse of duty.<br /><br />I know who I trust !<br /><br /><br />SR Vendors I salute you !!!

				To me silkroad is an opportunity to experience things that I likely never would have gotten the chance to otherwise. It&#039;s not easy to find connections for things other than MJ, and truth be told I don&#039;t really care for MJ all that much. Plus, like I&#039;ve been saying since my first experience with SR, bank tellers are the friendliest dealers in the world :D
