				I was intrigued by the recent posts by scammers bragging about how easy it is to rip people off on SR, so I thought I&#039;d test it.<br /><br />TEST 1<br />I started off with the phishing sites on Hidden Wiki. I couldn&#039;t be bothered to actually make a site so I pulled the password database from an existing (not too bright) phisher. Big list, took a while. I could have walked away with thousands of dollars, really, that easy. It&#039;s not just ignorance causing this, it&#039;s outright stupidity too.&nbsp; I&#039;ve watched one person who had their password changed by this phisher start a new account with a slightly different username but same password, log into that account through the phisher and ask SR for a new password to his original account which he then used to login through the phisher again.&nbsp; Cool huh?&nbsp; But a pleasant surprise were the abandoned seller accounts, hey, now I wouldn&#039;t have to pay for the next part of my test.<br /><br />TEST 2<br />Used one of the abandoned seller accounts to offer some coke at reasonable prices, not too cheap. Using an old seller account was good because not only did it have age to it, it already had one 5/5 feedback.&nbsp; &nbsp;I insisted on all buyers finalizing early of course.<br />And away we go. I&#039;m not even going to bother to tell you what happened because you can already guess. The surprise was that it wasn&#039;t only new buyers trying to throw their money at me. Some people should know better!<br /><br />Look, it was just curiosity, I didn&#039;t really expect it to be that easy!<br />What I should do now is suggest a whole lot of shit to improve things but right now I can&#039;t think of any, lol, must be this lovely Lemon I&#039;m smoking.<br /><br />I used to feel sympathy for the people getting scammed. Some of those people still deserve that sympathy, but a lot more don&#039;t.<br />Right, time to refund the last orders,close my seller account,&nbsp; and turn out the lights.<br /><br />Have Fun.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I agree with you man, it is too easy to scam SR customers. They almost demand people like me take their money. and they log in to phishing sites religiously. it is honestly easier than taking candy from a baby. someone could probably even post here in the forums that listing X by vendor Y is a scam before they put up the listing, and still clean house. and when it takes the admin a day from the first scam report to shut that vendor account down, it is not a stretch to say that scammers are getting away with thousands of dollars in a matter of a couple days. Like I said in another thread though, I only take money that is freely given to me by either people who don&#039;t think to save their link to the road or people who throw orders at one of my listings, and finalize without even a single message to me. I don&#039;t lose any sleep over it, because it could all be avoided by opening your eyes, and paying a little attention. Silk Road could put in a few measures to stop early finalization to cut down on scams, but honestly why would they? They are still getting their 6.25% (unless they are refunding it to people who buy from proven scammers, but I haven&#039;t heard of that yet)

				damn man. yeah i hear you. are you ssynchronicity (2.0)? when i first started buying i made sure to make contact with the sellers i bought from and made sure my orders were under escrow when ordering from sellers for the first time. only thing that would really get me is if a reputable seller got his/her account stolen - not much I could do about that. you&#039;d think people would be *extra* careful on a site like SR, but I guess drugs are just *that* alluring to people that their guard drops before they even start. crazy.

				Look: I&#039;m still just kind of irked, since the btc scammer that burnt a bunch of people came back on here, trying to pain himself in some kind of better light, and it sickens me.&nbsp; It&#039;s not &#039;hustling&#039; or any sort of serious con: it&#039;s just lying to people who put a lot of effort into getting here, and don&#039;t quite realize we have people who will lie and steal their money.&nbsp; It&#039;s more an escrow problem, than anything else.&nbsp; <br /><br />But it&#039;s arguable, if you think these scam tests help people, fine, no quarrel.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t.<br /><br />Here&#039;s one from peopleb4profits: &quot;Additional, I could provide a valued service being that I can spot a scammer faster than any1 of u.&quot;<br />or<br />&quot;I already sell on SR and I am the top seller in my drug category. Hell, I have a dam good rating and im known as a trustworthy guy.

				If I leave my front door unlocked, it&#039;s all right to go in and steal my money. That&#039;s your reasoning. Lack of information is the unlocked door. You trespass into my username because I don&#039;t understand how to use SR securely yet. It&#039;s all right to steal my money since my account was unlocked. I will rob that physically handicapped person since they are weaker. You steal from me using your strength over my intellectual handicap. Congratulations. Keep rationalizing to yourselves that taking people&#039;s property is justified because your victims are uninformed or careless so they deserve it. <br /><br />Making people pay for buyer accounts could help. Too much would keep new buyers away so it&#039;d have to be low. Maybe $10 or $20 in btc. That way the buyer would already know how to get Bitcoins and it would prevent some of the planted feedback and reduce useless accounts. Registering at the forum should be part of making an account, but there shouldn&#039;t be a required number of posts needed or time spent in the forums.<br /><br />I think that some limitations to the number and value of transactions for new sellers and buyers would reduce the losses to scams and maybe discourage impatient thieves. <br /><br />I hear the people who don&#039;t want any more rules and restrictions. But really, you already have to use Tor, pay a 6.25% fee, check the forums for scams and know how to use SR securely. I understand wanting to sell and buy anything available at will, but waiting a couple weeks for normal use is more likely to annoy scammers than legitimate SR users. Even with these changes, selective scams and waiting to scam after some real feedback can still happen.<br /><br />It&#039;ll never be perfect , but it can always be better.

				davekozy: Which bit do you not understand about my posts? You&#039;re the second one that seems to think I&#039;ve been stealing from people. <br /><br />I HAVE NEVER STOLEN A FUCKING THING IN MY LIFE! Is that clear enough for you and anyone else who just skims through the posts. I also do not condone stealing from people. To continue your dubious analogy, if you were told by numerous people that there was a thief in your neighborhood who was going around checking peoples doors to see if they were unlocked would you really expect sympathy if you continued to leave your door unlocked and consequently got robbed?<br /><br />phubaiblues: I have to agree, my timing sucks, I failed to consider the feelings of people recently scammed and appear to have rubbed their mistakes in their faces. For that I apologize to anyone who has truly been upset by my actions and posts.<br />I would love to be able to propose some improvements to be able to help newbies, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;d come up with anything that cleverer people haven&#039;t already thought of.&nbsp; This is human nature we&#039;re talking about here, both the ones who steal and the ones who rush into things.

				My post wasn&#039;t directed at you scamtest since you gave the money back. In fact, what you did will probably strengthen the site because those involved will be more mindful of account security. <br /><br />It was towards the other poster fisher who said, since I left my money accessible anyone can justifiably take it. Say I leave money on the bar when I take a piss and it&#039;s gone when I come back. That&#039;s fine, since I left it unattended. How is taking advantage of people&#039;s mistakes or lack of knowledge the right thing to do? That&#039;s dishonest, dope fiend behavior. <br /><br />The damn scammers returning to brag about and rationalize their conquests are just fucked up. Take the money and run. Psychopaths hurt people without remorse.

				I&#039;m actually starting to think, that the only way we can protect people is to go back to the way it was just a few months ago.&nbsp; Transactions were done in escrow.&nbsp; You didn&#039;t finalize until you received product.&nbsp; Escrow was what made this site different from the other sites, and why newbies felt safe here....without escrow, as has been shown, it&#039;s just all too easy to rip, whether it be in btc, or actual product.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was the first guy I saw doing it, to put &quot;trusted seller, finalize early&quot; and now I wish I&#039;d never done it...it was before hedging was available, and just to show some good will towards trusted sellers.&nbsp; I thought it was a really cool thing, and I saw some other guys start to do it...but it got out of hand: I never figured sellers would start to ask for it, or even require it.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fucked up thing, is that for the *good* sellers, it&#039;s no problem, but maybe they&#039;d be willing to pay that price, if everybody had to do it, to ensure site&#039;s survival?<br /><br />In any case, no worries scamtest, I know you&#039;re on our side, and want what&#039;s good for site, and this showed that something needs to be done...<br /><br />&nbsp;

				+100 on staying in escrow....unless you&#039;ve got a FAN-fucking-Tastic&nbsp; reason not too.&nbsp; &nbsp;A seller requiring it automatically isn&#039;t a great reason IMO.&nbsp; Unless that vendor is HIGHLY respected and has the most amazing FORUM feedback from trusted members....I wouldn&#039;t finalize early for any NEW vendor under any circumstances until they get some feedback.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are no shortcuts to getting a good reputation.&nbsp; &nbsp;All the recent scams have hurt too many.....everybody on the SR gets impacted by scammers in one way or another.<br /><br />Bottom line is STAY IN ESCROW,&nbsp; Hedged even better.

				I finalized early for G2G and it looks like I got burned. I did it because it was an international order. At least it was only for a half. I understand sellers wanting their btc before shipping to another country because of the greater chance of it getting seized. Finalizing early transfers all of the risk to the buyer.<br /><br />I won&#039;t go out of escrow for any US sellers unless I&#039;ve dealt with them successfully a few times. Very few overseas sellers, even newer ones, will ship here without finalizing early so if I want what they&#039;ve got, I&#039;ve got to be willing to accept losing my money if the vendor doesn&#039;t come through or the package gets seized.<br /><br />
