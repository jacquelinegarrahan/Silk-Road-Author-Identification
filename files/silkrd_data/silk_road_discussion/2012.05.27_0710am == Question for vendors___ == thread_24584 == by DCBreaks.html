				Yea, that really sucks.&nbsp; A buyer should release funds within a day or two of recieving their package.

Feedback can always be added later or edited later to comment on quality, but if the package has arrived there is no reason not to finalize immediately.

				Letting it go to auto-finalize is no good.&nbsp; Once you have received your product it&#039;s not fair to the vendor to hold out on the funds for weeks.&nbsp; It may not be much on the buyer&#039;s side, but if everyone did that it could hang up the operation pretty bad.&nbsp;

				Open it, smell it, smile, make single skinner as things load up, smoke away grinning as leaving fantastic feedback to the fantastic vendors. BOOM!<br /><br />Life really is great sometimes.

				I think a buyer that leaves it to auto-finalise may also find vendors may not seek to do business with them again.

				I will hash the pricks adress and cancel any future oeders. How is that adress hashing software coming along Pine?&nbsp; Also I bet some vendors blacklist people by their adress, they just dont advertise stashing adresses.

				Pisses me off to fuck and I blacklist them from buying again if they do it. Clearly they got their shit because if not they would have contacted me or put it in resolution. <br /><br />It&#039;s low because if you put the effort it as a vendor you naturally expect some courtesy.&nbsp; &nbsp;
