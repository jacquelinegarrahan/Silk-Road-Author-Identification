				I learned of the SR back in about 2010, but didn&#039;t actually come to check it out until this year, when reading an article somewhere reminded me about it&nbsp; ;D 8)<br /><br />&nbsp; I guess there a many way to &#039;come across the road&#039;&nbsp; ....&nbsp; I was just wondering how others found out about the place and how long between hearing about it and actually joining and making purchases was it for you my forum fr(i)ends&nbsp; ;D ???<br /><br />&nbsp;And did it take any of you about a week to completely sort out wtf with PGP and get a handle on the forums<br /><br />Motek went through a phishing site first registration (onion + .to at the end = BAD)<br />and had to make all new accounts, and after a few successful purchases, promptly got uber confused with &quot;which password/min, went where?!&quot; and locked herself out of her second accouny! (fortunately SR support came to the rescue, bless their patient and helpful hearts&nbsp; 8) 8)<br /><br />And so she had to open a THIRD account where finally, she&#039;s been able to &quot;keep it all together&quot;&nbsp; ::) <br /><br />And so she&#039;d like to know (if you&#039;re happy to tell, of course :D )<br />&nbsp;how did you choose the nym you have?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Mine means &quot;sweetheart&quot; in Hebrew ... it fitted at the time ... plus it kinda sounds like some motor parts store&nbsp; :o&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;I like the ambiguity&nbsp; ::) ;D<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Looking forward to tales where ... &quot;the truth is stranger than fiction&quot;&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br />I hope you are all doing as well as you can ...love motek&nbsp; :D

				Well I heard about it back in 2011 at Electric Zoo festival when i overheard these 2 guys talkin about it.. I never followed up to check it out tho.<br />Then about 2 years later (a month ago) I was doing a research paper for my economics class about different currencies and I ran into an article about the &quot;currency of the future&quot;. so i thought bitcoins sounded really cool and then the end of the article mentioned Silk Road. I&#039;m like hey that sounds familiar! I looked it up and I&#039;ve been on here since :)
