				I wasn&#039;t sure I wanted to post this, but decided to. I have had, the last few weeks, a very pronounced decrease in orders and I haven&#039;t been able to get to why that is. I mean, my prices are very reasonable, even toward the lower end, while my product is extremely good, and I have a stellar customer satisfaction record, if still a smaller number of total sales than the big guys/girls on the road. <br /><br />I even have started to offer free shipping, and yet my sales are miserable.<br /><br />Are many of you people suffering from the same thing? Would it be tied simply to problems buyers have with obtaining bitcoins?&nbsp; If so, SR must be having decresded earnings as well.<br /><br />goblin

				I was reading in http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181513.15 about new commission structures. Are prices then increasing for buyers due to this alone? I wonder if payout to vendors for sales have also been reduced because of a simultaneous increase in those fees as well.<br /><br />Any vendors care to compare notes?

				I think it is a sum of parameters.<br />BTC decreasing steadily made people beware of buying them right now (those who buy in bulk mostly), for the same cause it is more difficult to find BTC in many places (for example in localbitcoins there was a huge emptiness of vendors), some inexperienced users seeing an increase in costs but not understanding that&#039;s hedging for the BTC value lowering etc. etc.<br /><br />Things will return normal soon. It may also be a casualty if the thing is not general.

				That&#039;s interesting. Places like localbitcoin people don&#039;t necessarily want to sell in a downturn if it means selling the BTC for significantly less than what they paid or had received them for in a value exchange. Maybe the thought is to wait for BTC to upturn before selling again.

				Vendors who operate out of and ship to the US are probably experiencing lower sales lately because of the fact that Bitinstant has taken a shit and there is now no easy way for us to buy BTC. I was leary to start using SR to begin with but now to think about sending Moneypaks to people I don&#039;t know and hoping they send me BTC is a little too much. I guess it was fun while it lasted unless Bitinstant comes back.

You can fund your account via USPS money order (cheapest of the money order options), no cost to process by mailing it to them.<br /><br />The FAQ says: Cost $1.55 to transfer up to $1,000 ($0.30 if issued by military facilities). It says free on my move USD page.<br /><br />You can also use Dwolla, but outbound bitcoin transfers will be frozen for 31 days. You can deposit a small amount ($1 minimum) into Dwolla at let it age for 31 days No cost on CampBX&#039;s end, at least on my transfer page.<br />This may vary depending on when you made your account. Maybe things are different for new accounts, I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />It&#039;s extremely easy to use and Bitcoin orders usually go through instantly if you buy at the current asking price.

				I&#039;m a personal usage amount buyer, and LocalBitcoins is easier than BitInstant was a year ago. It&#039;s not just &#039;local bitcoins&#039; - it may have started that way, but I go straight for the ones who use bank deposit. You fill out the deposit slip, go to the teller, make the deposit. Coins &#039;chime&#039; in on my wallet App, within minutes. <br /><br />There are also a few that say on their listing. &quot;For those looking to do larger orders message me&quot;. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure you could also just do multiple deposits as a way to &#039;break up&#039; the large amount to avoid the appearance of impropriety. <br /><br />Just as you&#039;d ship a bulk order in multiple packages, not one big gorilla cage box! :o<br /><br />Good Luck all!<br /><br />We will weather this storm.

				I think another reason for declining sales as of late has been the lowered value of bitcoins for those who bought them a while back when they were extremely high and don&#039;t want to feel like they are losing cash. I know personally I try not to purchase anything when the current price is significantly less than what I paid for them.

				There&#039;s also a lot of competition considering if your a cannabis vendor. So many choices, right before the 4th of july holiday had a surge of orders, but has been slowing down afterwards. The bitcoin price as others have said might have an affect on this as well. It should smooth out over time.

				Yep, getting bitcoins has become a real bitch in Canada. I either have to put up with Localbitcoin prices or identify myself to Cavirtex. Cavirtex are working hard on a solution- it seems they really understand the value of anonymity in bitcoin trading- and I have faith they&#039;ll reach a more adequate solution by August or September. Until then, I must (dare I say it?!) cut down my intake of the Silk Road&#039;s gourmet psychedelics.

				Could be lots of folk with small stashes of bitcoins that are now worth half or more of what they bought them for and are holding tight to see if they rise again to recover some of what they lost.<br /><br />I was watching the price when they were recently at 80 Euro and waited for about a week to see if they would fall like they had done most of that week. I got impatient convincing myself they were at their lowest so jumped in and bought them and belive it or not, it&#039;s almost like they waited on me and they dropped that evening by about 10%. After a week or so they started to fall more so I panic bought to stop the bleeding.<br /><br />I now know to pick an item I want, buy the coins and buy straight away and not see bitcoins as an investment

				Yea it probably is the problems people are having with bit coins. That always was SR&#039;s biggest strength and biggest weakness. But have faith I am sure things will get better in the near future. You just have to hang in there.
