				So when a seller says &quot;5 LSD tickets (300Âµg)&quot;, it means it&#039;s 75 ug per tab, right? Usually a blotter has 4 tabs as far as I know.

				I&#039;d read that as 300ug per tab best thing to do is ask the vendor though.

				A blotter is a Tab... same thing different word... A strip is 10 and a sheet is 100.. and a book/bible is 500..... If your referring to a vendor saying 300 ug they are most likely the Dali lama Tabs and yes that is 300 per hit!!!

				That is interesting, because on Erowid.org, it says:<br /><br />&quot;The most common form of LSD is paper blotter divided into about 1/4&quot; squares called tabs. &quot;<br /><br />The way I understand it, a blotter = a ticket. But a blotter or a ticket = 4 tabs.<br /><br />Anyway, you&#039;re right, I&#039;m gonna ask the seller.<br /><br />I thought this is an easy question to answer but I ended up more confused than I was before, haha :).

				Thanks guys. I consider myself illuminated :D.<br /><br />But allow me to say that... WOW, LSD is damned expensive in this case!... (but hey, I can&#039;t argue, the stuff is awesome).
