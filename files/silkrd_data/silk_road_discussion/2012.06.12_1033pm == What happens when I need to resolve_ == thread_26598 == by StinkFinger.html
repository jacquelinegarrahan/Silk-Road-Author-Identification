				Not mentioning any names yet but I have recently made a purchase on SR. <br /><br />It&#039;s about my 7/7 purchase with no problems so far. The vendor has asked me to FE and the status of my order has gone from processing to &quot;in transit&quot;. I have replied to him after this stating that I am genuine and will not FE. There has been no response so have written to him a second time and asked what is the status of my order. It&#039;s early days but I have not had a response as of yet. The option to &quot;resolve&quot; this will arrive in 7 days so what will happen? Are my BTC safe? My BTC as still held in escrow and am unable to cancel the order so that I can shop elsewhere. Has any one else had a problem like this? This is UK to UK btw.<br /><br />Thanks for any help<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Which vendor is this? PM me if you don&#039;t want to state publicly. There is a well established UK vendor scamming people at the moment.<br /><br />Your bitcoins are safe as long as you don&#039;t press finalize.

				You can give the vendor more time for the order to get through or have option of having a 100% refund or less depending on the circumstances.<br /><br />Which vendor is something you best leave out until you PM the vendor. Maybe be a mic up. I had to resolve due to wrong order. I kept the wrong order and got the right one! <br /><br />I also had a new seller refund me without my permission! He was new. Though he was doing me a favour. I wanted more time for the thing to arrive. So I get a less than 100% record for refunds!<br /><br />Remember a bad refund rate makes vendors boycott you!<br /><br />I&#039;m ok its only 2% or so and will hopefully get less when more orders come.<br /><br />Resolving is easy. Its all there on the resolve page. But message the vendor. Maybe he or she will make things better for you.<br /><br />Never let it resolve without trying to sort it person to person.&nbsp; ;)
