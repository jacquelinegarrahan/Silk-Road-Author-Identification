				Hello, All,<br />New Vendor here,<br />In a couple/few weeks I&#039;m going to be offering 10 grams of DMT, in .25g quantities to buyers with good stats in order to get my name and product out there, and get some reviews going.&nbsp; So, basically 40 free samples to the right people.&nbsp; Can I post ads on the SR for zero dollars/btc??&nbsp; Or do I have to charge something, so SR can take its commission??&nbsp; And, just curious.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only made two sales so far, and Im assuming since there wasn&#039;t any info on the transaction pages that included buyers stats, that these were both New buyers.&nbsp; Where would I go to look at a buyers stats - just to confirm that they have good stats, for my free samples?&nbsp; Will it say how many transactions they&#039;ve done by there user name?&nbsp; Any info will be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks everyone:)

				I would suggest you to take a look at the &quot;Inter-Galactic Brotherhood of Deemsters&quot; thread in the &quot;Rumor Mill&quot; sub-forum on which you can find many experienced users of DMT to ask for a review.<br /><br />While purchasing stats are a good evidence of experience with SR, they don&#039;t necessarily evidence a good experience on evaluating the specific product you want reviewed (just as a little example: if a guy buys everyday H from the Road, you can be assured that he will have very good purchasing stats on SR, but that doesn&#039;t necessarily means that the guy will have experience with what you want reviewed at all). <br /><br />In any case, as others have said here, 250 mg samples of DMT is, also in my opinion, a little to generous for a review. If the person is experienced enough on vaporizing DMT you need for an average weight no more than 30 mg for a typical breakthrough. But naturally I&#039;m not complaining, I&#039;m just saying to you this because you will probably have some expenses to face in initiating your vendor&#039;s account properly.<br /><br />Take care.

				I would recommend a token price, say $US5 or 10 so the rating you receive for samples have more weight to them.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Feedback_Score<br /><br />If you want to try shipping to Australia I would be happy to sample then give a forum review.<br />Some examples of my reviews:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13867.msg134267#msg134267<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120189.msg817796#msg817796<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120189.msg828224#msg828224

				I would like to enter the review team too, if possible.<br /><br />Don&#039;t give 250mg samples, it&#039;s just too much. i guess 100mg is good enough.

				I&#039;m definitely interested in a sample. I have quite a bit of experience with psychedelics such as LSD and psylocybin, but have only done DMT once. However, I&#039;m on the above mentioned list of reliable reviewers, and would definitely give as accurate and honest a review as I possibly could.
