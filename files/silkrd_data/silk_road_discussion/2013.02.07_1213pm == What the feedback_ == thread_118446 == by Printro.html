				Something with the feedback system is wrong, are buyers afraid to leave real feedback scores / afraid this will cause an FE from future vendors or something?&nbsp; If so, the system doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was recently reading a vendors feedback comments and they were shocking, but was constantly given a 5/5 for stupid reasons, example:<br /><br />5/5&nbsp; Worst meth ever, however received in next day delivery as promised.<br /><br />Firstly 90% of that 5/5 would belong to the postman, the dealer just sent it on the same day (which is good, yes, agreed), but still a 5/5 for &#039;worst meth ever&#039;?<br /><br />Can vendors review each buyers individual feedback from every purchase they have ever made?&nbsp; Is this why the 5/5?&nbsp; Or do buyers just not understand what would constitute as a 5/5?<br /><br />(Also just to note, apart from one bad experience, all of my feedback has been 5/5, I am no hardass either, but all my dealers were 5/5 in terms on time &amp; product).<br /><br />Has anyone else experienced this or felt they needed to leave 5/5 when it wasn&#039;t that?

				I think it&#039;s because the formula that calculates the vendor rating is very sensitive to ratings under 5. Even a 4/5 can pull a vendor down quite a few points.<br />The general consensus seems to be that if you got the shit you ordered, you give 5/5. Anything less is for a fuck up of some kind.

				Id have to agree that the system may be extremely too sensitive. Ive been reading through the forums and like Ukbenjy said, apparently even a 3/5 or 4/5 drops a vendors rating over 1%, which is obviously bad because no member wants to order from a vendor with a 96% rating, even though they might possibly have the best stuff around.

				Generally any vendor will make it very clear, that if there is ANY issue with your order, to PM them before giving a shitty feedback score. So that they have an opportunity to make right by the buyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;Though loads of people, regardless of how bad the experience or product was, will still leave a good feedback score..9/10 times, its the newer buyers with low purchasing stats.

				I&#039;ve only left 2 negative feedback scores in my SR career.&nbsp; One was a no-show, and even though I received a refund, the way the guy responded to me was handled very poorly, thus I gave a 3 of 5.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other product I gave a low feedback score was because I ordered something express, the vendor agreed to next day shipping, and it didn&#039;t arrive for almost a week.&nbsp; It was shipped Express, but 4 days after the agreed upon shipping date.&nbsp; When I asked for a refund on shipping costs he refused and wrote a one page essay on how much of a noob I am and that I don&#039;t understand SR (when in fact I had been here around a year longer than the vendor under a different account).&nbsp; Gave a 1/5 on this one - trust me - if you would have read the response,&nbsp; you would have too.&nbsp; It was almost enough to get him banned if I were to report it.<br /><br />There have been plenty of instances where I could have left a negative score (bad product, short product, slow shipping, etc), but the vendors responded to my concern promptly and courteously which is king in my book.&nbsp; Good customer service goes a long way.&nbsp; <br /><br />The guy that left a 5/5 for the &quot;worst meth ever&quot; could have received a full refund, partial refund, or the vendor could have worked it out.&nbsp; I agree, there are far too many 5/5&#039;s given, but anything less really hurts a sellers reputation.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to cost a vendor business if I have a small problem with my order, especially if he is wiling to work w/ me.&nbsp; It&#039;s when the vendor screws up, then is a dick -that is when I take action.

				I left twice some 5/5 when they should have been 4/5.&nbsp; It&#039;s only because it has a huge effect on their rating and I don&#039;t like to hurt people and their business if it doesn&#039;t appear as really necessary. I agree a 4/5 should not have that big an impact on the seller rating.<br /><br />First time was a vendor who sent me some indian generic instead of the brand meds I bought, in a suspicious looking packaging. However, shipping was fast, package was slashed, but not seized, and the generic was potent. So I gave it 5.<br /><br />Second time was another vendor promising brand meds from a domestic location. This time, product was genuine, but was sent from the depths of another continent and took more than 3 weeks to arrive. However, vendor replied and explained himself. His explanations were coherent. So I left a 5 again. <br /><br />Really hesitated on both of them but ah. I&#039;m such a nice guy.

				Some of the busiest vendors on sr require FE.. They also stipulate you leave feedback when FE&#039;ing so they can &#039;track&#039; your order..<br /><br />These vendors are so busy that by the time your package, should or should not have not arrived, your feedback is no longer visible on the vendors profile page. <br /><br />This results in completely useless feedback system. <br /><br />Answer is don&#039;t FE or if you must only leave feedback once it arrives! NOT BEFORE!

				Norfork - for your information, you can change your feedback anytime, regardless of when you leave it so it&#039;s really a non issue - ALSO you shouldn&#039;t finalize early period.&nbsp; If you absolutely must, you can leave feedback saying FE, then amend that feedback anytime&nbsp; you chose.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how far back in your feedback history you can go, but I have changed feedback on items that were purchased a few weeks back to leave more detail regarding product quality.<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend anyone FE.&nbsp; That is why we are here.&nbsp; Do I do it w/ certain vendors, sure, but I&#039;ve built a very long term relationship with them and never for large orders.&nbsp;

				Yes the feedback system is pretty useless at this point. I think buyers are afraid that if they leave a vendor neg feedback other vendors may not work with them.<br /><br />Don&#039;t just rely on the ratings. Also search the forums and you can always ask the community about a vendor.<br /><br />I think the feedback should be anonymous and vendors should be allowed to to leave feedback to buyers as well.<br />
