				Growing but if it&#039;s your first offence and a personal grow you would likely get a slap on the wrist with a fine and maybe community service.

				tough question, depends how many plants you got caught with and if you had children living in the house and your criminal history. If you had a large amount sent I would say it would be worse (involving federal workers pisses the government off) but if you are in the west coast states or one with medical marijuana then a few plants would be really hard to get caught for and if it did happen it would be a small charge.

				Getting caught with drugs sent through mail from a different state is a Federal Offense if they feel like being a dick about it and obviously depending on how much you are caught with.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same thing as trying to smuggle drugs through state line and if you are caught you are fucked.

				Go look up your state laws at norml.org and see how many plants equals a felony.<br /><br />

				Totally depends on where you live and how much you&#039;re growing.&nbsp; In some states growing is not a huge deal, so as long as you&#039;re below the level of federal attention it&#039;s not really that big of a deal. In some states it can be a 5 year mandatory minimum sentence up to literally life sentences in some states if too close to schools or churches. Growing pot illegally will also almost always net you possession and possession with the intent to distribute charges.<br /><br />Sending drugs through the mail domestically will net you a mail fraud charge, possession charge, possible possession with intent to distribute, and even RICO/conspiracy violations. <br /><br />Growing/Manufacturing drugs is also a federal offense, but barring large scale you&#039;re gonna be facing local state charges and not federal ones, although if your stupid and keep records of grow supplies that were shipped or any evidence that someone else knew about and/or participated in your grow/manufacturing then you could conceivably be charged with many of the same federal crimes for growing as you could for having it shipped. <br /><br />The question is really so dependent on a whole slew of particulars that it&#039;s really not possible to give a definitive answer. If it&#039;s marijuana in question, go to NORML&#039;s website and check out your state laws.Then get yourself a prescription or recommendation or whatever your state calls it!<br /><br />Peace.

				Tough question? Not a tough question. Sure, if you have a warehouse full of packaged weed vs. a single plant growing on your sill, you&#039;re going to see more time for the warehouse. But look at production vs possession penalty *ranges* and you&#039;ll see production carry a higher range in - I would virtually guarantee - every place both activities are illegal.<br /><br />LE and prosecutors also have a nasty habit of overvaluing plants as well. It&#039;s completely commonplace in Canada, for example, for LE to value each plant of any size and quality at $1000. 10 plants, that&#039;s $10,000 worth of weed, say they. Well my god, you&#039;re a goddamned drug baron, aren&#039;t you? $10k worth of weed?

				Again, way too many variables for such a simplistic answer. let me give you some examples.<br /><br />Arizona: Possession = 4 months-3.75 years. Trafficking = 2-12.5 years. Manufacturing = 6 months to 8.75 years.&nbsp; In Arizona, depending on amounts, Trafficking can easily be the bigger crime, and the act of bringing Marijuana into Arizona is considered Trafficking regardless of amount. When you add in the inevitable mail fraud and conspiracy charges that an individual would face, in the state of Arizona, growing personal amounts is substantially smaller penalty than having it shipped in from SR via USPS.<br /><br />Montana: Possession = 6 months - 5 years. Intent to distribute = 20 years. Cultivation = 10 years. In Montana, if there is any evidence of resale (baggies, scales, marijuana in more than one container) then with added mail fraud, conspiracy charges etc, the penalties COULD be higher for getting it from SR, but would depend heavily on circumstances.<br /><br />Ohio: Possession = 0-8 years based, trafficking = 0-8 years, Cultivation = considered possession using aggregate weight of plants.. In Ohio it&#039;s all about weight... plants are heavier than dried ready to use pot, but with possession and possible trafficking charges plus mail fraud etc you could go either way depending on circumstances.<br /><br />South Carolina: Possession = 30 days - 1 year. Trafficking = 5-25 years with mandatory minimums. Cultivation = 2-25 years with mandatory minimums. sentences will be very similar though mandatory minimums for large scale will be worse for cultivation.<br /><br />Federal: Possession = 1-3 years. Sale = 5-life. Cultivation = 5-life. Federally it depends entirely on what other charges you face. It is true that simple possession is a smaller crime, but having something shipped in from SR is substantially more involved than just possession if they want it to be. <br /><br />Way to many variables for an easy answer. Manufacturing herb can often times come with charges of possession, and intent to sell/traffic, and if the grower is truly careless mail fraud, conspiracy etc. Getting drugs mailed to you will almost certainly invoke mail fraud, conspiracy, racketeering, possible computer fraud charges, even violation of the computer fraud and abuse act could theoretically be levied by the government.<br /><br />There is no simple answer to this. Know the laws and check out norml.org. <br /><br /><br /><br />
