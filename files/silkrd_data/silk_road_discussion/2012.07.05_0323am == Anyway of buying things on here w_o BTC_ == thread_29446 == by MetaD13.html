				Just wondering, since I&#039;ve got a debit card and am trying to purchase BTC with it but its a pain in the ass. Someone told me to use VirWox, but that would require me to go through moneypaks and PayPal. I don&#039;t think it would be in my best interest to leave that big of a trail(even though I doubt I&#039;ll be traced, but better safe than sorry). <br /><br />So do people have other ways of trading/buying items on SR besides using BTC? Could someone reputable on here send me BTC in exchange for my debit card?(obviously major risk of getting scammed so I&#039;d only do this with someone with a good reputation).

				Thanks for the replies! I guess you&#039;re right though, I&#039;ll be patient and review my options again tomorrow. I probably won&#039;t give the card to anyone on here, that was just an idea.<br /><br />Btw I&#039;m in the US.

				Why would you ever want to use something other than BTC? The security allowed is too good to pass up. What&#039;s more important, getting your fix NOW or being patient and not getting your ass busted? <br /><br />Use Bitinstant.com. It has multiple ways of purchasing BTC that anyone in the US can handle.

				do you have no money to spend besides the debit card?<br /><br />if that&#039;s the case you&#039;re probably a kid, otherwise you don&#039;t need to spend it on drugs<br /><br />if you do have other money, use bitinstant

				I don&#039;t know where the topicstarter is from. But for example: in Holland most people don&#039;t even own a credit card. Everybody uses debit cards for everything. From doing your groceries to paying your hotelroom or buying a new tv. Tourists are turned down in supermarkets all the time because they want to pay with credit cards. I&#039;ve seen cashiers (outside of Amsterdam) that didn&#039;t even recognize credit cards when tourists wanted to use them. So not having a credit card doesn&#039;t mean your a kid. I have a credit card because i travel a lot outside of Europe but I think I&#039;m the only one in my group of friends and I&#039;m far from a kid ;).
