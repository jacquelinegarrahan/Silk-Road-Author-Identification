				I&#039;m having trouble making the small hole at the bottom of the bottle since I don&#039;t have a drill like most people suggest you use. I&#039;m using a small glass tobasco bottle instead of the usual Hennesy bottle also, its basically the same size although the glass at the bottom is a bit thicker, which is giving me trouble. Any suggestions for making the hole? I&#039;ve been going at it with a small screwdriver and haven&#039;t had any success.

				You need the Hennesey bottle.&nbsp; The way the bottom is shaped makes it perfect.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t use a drill.&nbsp; Just get an awl ( a screwdriver like thing but with a sharp point.&nbsp; Just hold the bottle and the awl in the center of the bottom and tap it with a hammer.&nbsp; You may want to get two bottles in case one breaks too much.&nbsp; You can clean the hole up a bit after you make it with a file or something.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to burn your steel wool with a torch to clean any coating off of it before you put it in the bottle. <br /><br />

				I tried looking for the Hennessy bottle, but couldn&#039;t find the small one. I guess I&#039;ll try looking a bit harder. Are they allowed to sell it on SR? If I can&#039;t find it after my next search then I&#039;ll try posting in product requests.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen alcohol sold on SR though before so idk

				Update<br /><br />I tried smashing out the bottom with a screwdriver and a hammer and the whole bottom came off! It made a circle a bit smaller than an inch and a half. Suprisingly, the edges aren&#039;t sharp, so I was wondering if I could just put my whole mouth around it to inhale the smoke? I&#039;ve also heard of some people taping it up and putting a straw in the middle when the same thing happened to them. Would that work also?<br /><br />

				I did mine with a small single serving southern comfort bottle.&nbsp; I bought a 5mm tile/glass drillbit Â£1.55 .&nbsp; Put bottle in vice, bottom facing upwards with cloth round it so it doesn&#039;t smash..Pour water into small concave dip on bottom of bottle then use glass drill bit to drill hole.. Works a treat :)
