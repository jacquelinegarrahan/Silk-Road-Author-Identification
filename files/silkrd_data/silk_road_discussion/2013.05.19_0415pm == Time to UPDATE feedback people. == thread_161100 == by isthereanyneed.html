				I never FE, but there are times when I have received the product but simply cannot test it out yet. I, like many others, will often leave a note in the feedback saying I will update later after testing it out. I ALWAYS do it. There has never been a time where I said I would update with a quality report later and didn&#039;t do it. That being said, I see a LOT of feedback (both new and old) where people claim they will do the same and never follow up. If I were a seller I&#039;d be PISSED!
