				The lucky individuals who fe&#039;d for InfiniteSource please email me at infinitesource1@tormail.com with your first and last name, and zip, to arrange refunds. I will, however, warn you that I am subtracting a equal percentage from each total to<br /><br />1. Pay for the items I have already sent out and won&#039;t be paid for<br />2. $500 vendor account.<br />3. Pay for the $350 in postage which is now sitting on a box, is non-refunadble, and useless.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t agree with these deductions, contact DPR, because he is the one who got all these funds.<br />Don&#039;t pm me here, I won&#039;t respond.&nbsp; I could take these funds and run, but I have morals, unlike 99% of these other anonymous pussy hiding behind keyboards. The mark of a true man is what he does despite no one ever knowing. Most you fuckers fail that test.<br /><br />As for why I was banned? My guess is because I hurt libatards feelings about his my little pony masturbation addiction and big daddy dpr banned me to make him stop crying.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFGFyc0BCAC+bVxUjlxCWwH6SukaQz20wy62uqkNK1UNIJUVcnxN7mWS9Fmj<br />pacHRVr3kkJW+S0Q17wB0KHpxRBfpKJTo2Ufsu9GvAYHi3an92jhcUoaoBCUGypO<br />VGMMVX9esjAjKRecIjJFd/qHzAEtUR5D8RKd6ItIx1ynekOBV56uhEZTjUVjJyhH<br />uRioerAu89238crPZVwTdvdSd6PYIaIz2w1h/pbNlxhyjbLQ+lZq4OiT5yZLgw29<br />DqWWpqxxqzRS7OupLGi47IGw2bwxMtTHoRdK/0/iGfu8Tg7UNKSTXT0I+2MHeFvy<br />cPlYEhJqCvf05uOIll87NRsAfHDicMWkuuFZABEBAAG0MWluZmluaXRlc291cmNl<br />IDxpbmZpbml0ZXNvdXJjZUBub3RhcmVhbGVtYWlsLmNvbT6JATgEEwECACIFAlGF<br />yc0CGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJEMme2/asBcOR4t4IAJeS<br />qXTj7hGIqWFWLpzkNXiTxE2zGyHrEFcTwgC4yz91KAwJ54rYAxp2NqBJ2UxK6OEF<br />wKEPx2KU2HD5ygFa92mj2UkGekcl86hYEqTo4oyPapx6tw2O3H8cjoGcrxcN4QKT<br />7WA0RCrU2eDO9Z/B9nLwnz9wryoIkAO08AsuBrfwu2ptdvJnt3o4ppzluGaiRgGV<br />15daI9GDRKqoKyx0MNW5tGmmZ0avepwOnksVeXA6YhnBSBS+2D9Mb0O6zaFMHhFJ<br />ISuDlY3qpF7MQ8P0YdIOe8m52jsk2tGh5tocNc7BnkCFKZmsy090edi4Pc5FOQWd<br />CsSdGpj1GbqaNLKhbfm5AQ0EUYXJzQEIAM0TQ8hdgQy3c3otIGEW06Sv7v1mEb8I<br />uslxs38kgIdjZfCtL6wT/u41b1KWpJ/OXc2s73Wgu0VZdnhE2JAhwFQraedilh+h<br />PNad+E9ohF52FyKsc5qdIXOJutLbmHlpBFKeQ912SjAxW+3lEA0mtNEWFzqOx5qa<br />L2H2ye5nwOcSfFHz6BgjVVy32MhvsIO2My6/ubZnhziioF/XblxgGwBOIECHkDjq<br />xqu8uW9tXMulRY7FpefsJQAw/UmkalP9ekODNWH8S8dfap/Hk9XXR2axaBZAM1mM<br />7dg8JAZg3YAOxkZiVKZ6MsIL2Df9g89/7/XMXvvacwu546ohcv/vCOUAEQEAAYkB<br />HwQYAQIACQUCUYXJzQIbDAAKCRDJntv2rAXDkT5JCACqTfdMoAwFqhNOAUqQnzKp<br />3A4gblCu75BHJ4lK/vMUxWQ4FOBDoLBLLlrelgxtS4vbnFMw0Jiih5WyAI5nuFmA<br />SpkjvUEBQuo7NLBWxPPqBoPbsituc8TKbCKU6wonObaY+YfP4BnV/WsVuevBT9DR<br />J2Lhqe7n+poby0J+h1Mt+wEpznB7p+P0zaYJSqXmEZW7BOCg/29O0/aurac0aBZQ<br />xI1D336D/ORrIbsLkKfxmX/5cQHcrbLoCyczksoA/V/aaDve9GPfwVlF1PeJXF2U<br />QrVMbP6TkPHGQf86Mhs2wIIjgWhHOdApzIEKGD/8NWXPCZD1aVelRLmEQyoVGQd3<br />=zZpK<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />

				So let me get this straight.<br />Are you REALLY asking people that did buy from you and that didn&#039;t receive your order to give you their contact info via tormail?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if there are people so stupid as to really do something like that but I would much prefer to get nothing than to give you my contact (legit or not it doesn&#039;t matter) without knowing if A) it is safe to begin with (who knows if tormail is 100% safe?), B) what you are going to do with those addresses (you have even been banned from SR so it can be that you are angry with it; who the hell knows what is going on in your mind right now).<br /><br />This is not a message against you as a person, mind you, it is only that I find you asking your buyer to do something like that completely irresponsible on your part. In a certain sense it would be like asking them to reply to this message with their address so that you will hopefully send them what they did buy.

				Don&#039;t be stupid enough to expect this moron of a scammer to send you a damn thing.&nbsp; He&#039;ll probably just try to blackmail you or some shit.&nbsp; He&#039;s a complete waste of time.<br /><br />It takes a *lot* to get someone banned: they have to cost more money than they&#039;re worth, and it takes a lot of fucking buyers turning away from Silk Road to cost as much as banning a single vendor.&nbsp; This guy got banned in what, 2 weeks?&nbsp; That says a lot.

Not a single person who has bought from me has claimed I scammed them. I had orders ready to ship about 3 hours ago until I luckily realized what happen. Do what you want. I have a word document of everyone&#039;s address I copy and pasted for FE orders. If I wanted to fuck you, I could. How a first name and zip could result in me fucking anyone is beyond my area of comparison.<br /><br />If I walk away right now, its well over....Well, its ALOT of money. I could buy 12 new vendor accounts. I&#039;m trying to be a good person, but assholes are making that door look a whole lot easier to walk out of.

Anyway, recently to remove spam topics in the interests of members so people don&#039;t fall for it and censor information like the e-mail or website of phishers, yet it&#039;s perfectly acceptable to keep this topic open with his information above when people have been saying he is possibly blackmailing or threatening people?<br /><br />I know the SR freedom of speech philosophy, but if we&#039;re looking to protect people it should be consistent otherwise people will just think that because it hasn&#039;t been modified whereas other topics have that this must be safe. We either protect people from falling for these things, or we don&#039;t.<br /><br />NB: Op - if you&#039;re a good vendor who takes customer privacy seriously, you won&#039;t have information on record anyway of your customers to refund them in any circumstance so you&#039;re either lying out your arse or you&#039;ve completely circumvented a very important part of protecting your customers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not entirely sure I follow your logic, I don&#039;t know what spam topics you are referring too and yes we delete scammer/spammer posts. How that relates to this situation from your perspective though escapes me, I am pretty tired though so maybe I&#039;m just not reading your post right.<br /><br />Anyway bottom line this thread stands as a warning to others to avoid this vendor, their reincarnations (if you believe their posts) and take appropriate precautions when ordering from any vendor because as you can see from reading this thread some people have no issue with using your identifiable information against you, hence my initial post warning not to send any identifiable info as per the OP&#039;s request.<br /><br />That make sense? <br /><br />Over and out, Zzzzz

				didn&#039;t I see a thread the other day where someone had claimed you tried to blackmail them over a BTC sale?&nbsp; I&#039;d say that, and making people FE when your account didn&#039;t meet the criteria to be allowed to are probably more likely reasons for your problems.<br />

				I think everything that needs to be said has been so I&#039;m locking this.<br /><br />You seem quite an unpredictable person, whether that is just a front or not you have clearly made threats regarding potential misuse of buyers information and it is probably advisable not to not let this discussion carry on.<br /><br />You have shown your true colors in glorious technicolor as unfortunate as that is, I can only hope you stay away from SR for the sake of the community.
