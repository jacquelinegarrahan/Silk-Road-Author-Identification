				Hello SR Forum,<br />This is my first thread, so consider this my introduction as well. Would of liked to do this earlier, but thanks to SR have been pretty busy. I have listed Meth &amp; GHB, my modus operandi is to treat others the way I would like to be treated. I think I do a pretty good job at that as my feedback would support that. <br />My first few weeks with SR have been great, blowing away all expectations, but with that success in my mind comes maybe too much risk. I think the escrow service is a must and because as a buyer I wouldn&#039;t want to finalize early, I don&#039;t want to ask my buyers to finalize early. Due to that and the success I have had my escrow account has a balance approaching high triple digits. My concern is not so much the cash flow, although this is a significant issue I don&#039;t see it as a risk per se. My concern is what were to happen in what I think is a real distinct possibility of the site being shut down. I can&#039;t imagine ever seeing those btc again. I cannot take that large of a hit, it would destroy me financially.<br />I am sure there are others with much higher escrow balances that mine, do you see this as big of a risk as I do?<br />I would imagine this has come up before, is there any proposed solutions that would address this issue? If the demand is there and I have the product I want to sell, but at the same time I can&#039;t have multi-thousands of dollars at risk indefinitely. Is asking buyers to finalize early the only remedy. I don&#039;t like this approach, but if it is the only way??<br /><br />Hopefully in future I will be able to get more involved over here in the forum. And from a whole perspective my experience here with everyone I have come across has been very positive.<br /><br />DubG

				There is an option to designate a backup address that your SR funds will be sent to if the site was to go dark. I imagine this includes funds in escrow, but I&#039;m not sure.

				You never know. It&#039;s possible SR has some sort of off site contingency plan for such occasions. <br /><br />In any case, selling drugs always has a modicum of risk, online or off. Considering that SR has been under the microscope of a number of federal agencies for over 6 months and still they haven&#039;t been able to disrupt it in a serious way, let alone shut it down I would be reasonably confident. Not saying it&#039;s impossible to do so but at the moment things seem to be in good shape. Of course, it&#039;s at your discretion whether you want people to finalize early. I did so for my first 5 or so orders and had no issues doing so.

				If a site is seized just the domain name is taken. SR would still have all the info and what not. He would be able to either open again on another DNS(right?) or give out all funds.

				Honestly I&#039;m surprised this isn&#039;t brought up more. I can relate to all the concerns voiced by DubG, and I was a little bit wigged when the site was down for a long time recently and nobody had any clue what was up. This is an inherently risky business environment, and I think that explains why some of the older hands here charge what seem like exorbinant prices: to compensate for that risk. Personally I think you need to set a limit to the amount of escrow you&#039;re comfortable with, knowing full well that you could lose it at any moment; once you hit that limit, go on vaca mode or request every subsequent order finalize early. I&#039;m totally skeptical of the backup-btc address myself...&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d also recommend getting contact info from solid customers you have. Then you could take your biz off the site, or it the site goes down, you&#039;ll still have order flow without the uncertainty of having evaporate here.<br /><br />&nbsp;The management of this place is a black box, nobody knows what will happen. Keeps it interesting I guess :)<br />

It&#039;s very encouraging for others considering starting as vendors.<br /><br />Regarding the issue raised of the bitcoins held in Escrow... I see a two-solution approach to this issue... firstly, buyers should finalize as soon as they receive the goods. Buyers need to appreciate that not releasing funds when they have the goods can cause cash flow or risk issues for vendors. I always make a point of releasing funds the same day for my vendors when I get the goods. <br /><br />That said, the international side of the business obviously means some vendors are going to have to wait several weeks to get funds released in some cases if they rely on ordinary Airmail. The solution here then may be to charge more for delivery and use priority Airmail services.<br /><br />Another way of approaching this problem of funds in escrow is to for vendors to transfer the risk to third parties, &quot;insurers&quot; if you like... I know there are some activities of this nature starting on SR now with business people with capital willing to provide credit lines to established vendors, kind of like the &quot;factoring&quot; services offered to businesses that offer credit, so that businesses can unlock working capital. This might be a good approach where vendors need to transfer some of the risk from certain sales/countries? This is even being done with syndicates or consortiums now so that the risk is shared. <br /><br />I take the same view as others have expressed which is that vendors should not worry about SR being shutdown and their Escrow funds disappearing. Even if LE did manage to shutdown SR, it wouldn&#039;t be long before the site was back up and running again from some other servers located in other countries outside the jurisdiction of LE. I just don&#039;t see how it is practically possible for any government to shut down a service on the internet which can simply by-pass any restrictions they can throw at it. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Tor is not like normal websites for instance hidden service collisions provide a natural tor redundancy there is no load balancing or geoip crap though if one server was to go down it&#039;s about 15 min before the other server comes on it&#039;s pretty much first come first serve on which server comes up <br /><br />and yes sr did make aware when the server went down last time and all sellers had to fucking add all there images again that there was several redundant servers in place <br /><br />

				If I were SR I think what I would do is the following. Buyer places order all funds into escrow, seller ships product, 50% of funds released to seller. Product arrives, buyer finalizes order and remaining funds are sent to Seller.

				Carding forums have guy&#039;s available on jabber 24/7 taking shifts when they do escrow of huge amounts. Same with exchangers, can&#039;t be too hard to set up, you&#039;d probably get more business with the certainty of vendors being able to find somebody to ease shutdown fears

				Just from a pure LE perspective (withstanding the fact that they actually have the capability to bust anyone on SR) going after buyers amounts to the same as busting dudes smoking joints in the park, usually they just don&#039;t care.&nbsp; Sellers on the other hand are the trophies they really are after, considering DubG deals in meth and GHB he&#039;s also a step higher on the ladder than your average pot dealer.<br /><br />Just saying, risks are spread out.

				Here&#039;s the way I look at it. Initially you can look at the Silkroad system, and think to yourself, &quot;Hey, this is flawed! What if everything goes down, and I lose all my shit?&quot; Well, people were saying this 6 months ago, too. Now here it is, 6 months later, and everything is still up and going. Those people who were speculating about the worst case scenario could have just relaxed, and kept every single order in escrow, and things would have been OK for them. The question is, what are things going to be like in the next 6 months? Everyone has their opinion on what will happen, but we all lack one thing, 100% accurate foresight.<br /><br />The problem, is that we don&#039;t know what&#039;s going to happen 6 months down the road. Us humans, unfortunately, are stuck within time and space, we cannot exist outside of it. When you say to yourself this system is flawed, you&#039;re right. It&#039;s not the Silk Road that&#039;s flawed, but it&#039;s being human that&#039;s flawed. It&#039;s the human condition. What if I have all my coins in escrow, and a nuclear bomb goes off and all the internet goes down? What if my wife cheats on me in 6 months? What if I get in a car accident tomorrow? All these questions stem from the same problem.<br /><br />So what do you do when faced with lack of foresight? Obviously, the only thing you can do is predict things the best that your human brain will allow you to. Follow your instincts, and don&#039;t let paranoia consume you. You take certain precautions, and take as much control of the situation as you can.<br /><br />Personally, what I&#039;d do if I were a vendor, is this. I&#039;d periodically go on vacation mode, long enough to transfer my coins out and have them converted to cash. I&#039;d make people finalize early, for orders over a certain size. I&#039;d make sure to put contact info up, so I could continue my drug mailing business even if silk road were to shut down.<br /><br />It&#039;d be an awesome feeling being a successful vendor here, because you&#039;re honestly a part of history. The Silkroad may be in history books that our kid&#039;s kid&#039;s will read. Our kid&#039;s kid&#039;s might use The Silkroad themselves. The Silkroad may shut down forever in ten minutes, or it may last forever.<br /><br />Btw, I put an order with you yesterday DubG, and I&#039;m looking forward to getting it!
