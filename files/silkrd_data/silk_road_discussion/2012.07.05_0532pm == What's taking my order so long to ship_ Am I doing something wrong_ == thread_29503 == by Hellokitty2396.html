				I ordered some pharmahuasca several days ago, and it still says processing. I also tried to message the seller, who is in the top 6% or something, and he still hasn&#039;t gotten back to me after a few days. His page says that he should be able to reply within 24 hours, but sometimes it might take him 48. It&#039;s been longer than that and still no reply. Is there any way for me to cancel? Halp.

				how many days do you mean by several? if he&#039;s a top seller he may be swamped with orders.

				Did you order from Dimitri? You can usually expect horribly horribly slow processing and shipping times from him but he almost always comes through. Some products on here take considerably longer than others to arrive due to many different issues. Best thing you can do to avoid this is to check the Rumor Mill to see how quickly your vendor will ship his product.<br /><br />If you want fast and efficient, don&#039;t order from Dimitri. If you have time, and you want a good product then order from him.

				There isn&#039;t an option? Contact the seller and inform him that you do not wish to wait weeks for your product. If he hasn&#039;t sent it, then you&#039;re good.
