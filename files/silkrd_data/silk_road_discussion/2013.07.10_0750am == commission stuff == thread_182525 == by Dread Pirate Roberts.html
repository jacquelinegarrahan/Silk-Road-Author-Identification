				-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Hi everyone,<br /><br />There has been quite a bit of discussion about the commission that is charged to vendors on Silk Road and I&#039;d like to do my best to put some misunderstandings to rest.&nbsp; Many things were changed in a recent update to accommodate displaying and pegging prices to many currencies.&nbsp; One of those changes was the way the commission is calculated.&nbsp; This change had virtually no effect on the vast majority of sales on Silk Road that occur in the less than $1000 range.&nbsp; The commission did rise on larger volume orders.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always felt that the 2% or so that was being charged on high priced orders was kind of low and decided to make the minimum commission 4%.&nbsp; I intended to inform our vendors of this through a message, but for some reason the message did not go through.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if this was human error, or a technical error of some kind, but despite what some of you might think I am a normal human being and capable of error.&nbsp; In any case, the warning of the commission change did not make it to the vendors, so when they realized the commission had been raised by about two percentage points on high priced orders without warning, they we&#039;re rightfully upset.<br /><br />However, this soon spiraled out of control with people making unfounded claims that the commission had doubled or tripled across the board, causing further outrage.&nbsp; I attempted to respond within the thread where this was being discussed, but multiple threads have been started now and the misconception has even spread to other websites.&nbsp; Hopefully this post will put the matter to rest.<br /><br />As I&#039;ve said all along, the commission that is charged is subject to change at any time, but because it is such a hot topic I am more than happy to reveal the commission schedule as it stands at this very moment.&nbsp; Keep in mind, this is subject to change at any time, and vendors have been equipped to handle changes in the commission without being warned ahead of time.<br /><br />The percent commission charged at this point can be found with the following formula:<br /><br />6.7 x e^(-p/6) + 4<br /><br />where p is the price of the listing in Bitcoins.&nbsp; So, for example, a 10 btc listing has a total commission of 5.27%, or 0.5265 btc.<br /><br />To give a little more perspective, at the current exchange rate of $75 per btc, a $1000 item under the former schedule now costs $1007.26.&nbsp; A $2000 item now costs $2028.07.&nbsp; And as said before, lower priced items are virtually unchanged.&nbsp; I think we can all agree that the service being provided by Silk Road to bring together a multitude of buyers and sellers and provide a safe platform for multi-thousand dollar deals is more than worth an extra 28 bucks.<br /><br />That being said, I take full responsibility for any and all misunderstandings up to this point.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t deliver the forewarning as I had intended and I am sure none of this would have been necessary had my message been delivered.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry for wasting everyone&#039;s time with all of this and I hope you can forgive me this slip up.<br /><br />Yours always,<br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJR3RI6AAoJEAIiQjtnt/olxTEIAIEh+/xzshuEXXEUc3rZwBE0<br />rMzROxU8N3xRjw1EC2KsZ8tmbZRDbZqc/hjuKtnruBQuIJbBrIJ7VEVIwMLQP/e1<br />iCovF0EGV1FFk+8AlaOLrzfionVpm6cO6ELCsEetk8GDxXBNRdWG3nLDPgVKnVsB<br />NX59txhMCk0XBI7p1658De9NhEjDXwqpcftSbxKk0++0v29rMrf8z7gb2B/JnKd3<br />4qyNMJtf+17HprZan9nndLU+BsZk7EtZH6dIakzRggQyf7/hJC1LWKPMlGsC1xNZ<br />/z1He7rVlShWUcwp7V3hK/QfoJl7tlndy7MMao3s308QiJ/SJdhadYAqB4Pu1xE=<br />=lKQV<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

It&#039;s already to the point where drug dealers are being held to the standards of mainstream businesses. Buying and selling drugs can quickly seem like completely normal things.. there are so many people unconcerned about taunting / provoking law enforcement. Obviously none of this would&#039;ve happened if that message had been successfully sent... Or if we all just remembered how remarkable / crazy this entire thing is. There&#039;ve definitely been several times when I&#039;ve had to remind myself.

				It was never, ever just a 1.5% fee. <br /><br />What is was before was $38.5 + 1.5% for amount over $1000. So for a $2500 order before, the commission was:<br /><br />$38.5(for 1st $1000) + (1.5% of $1,500=22.5) for a total of $61 dollars or 2.44% of total order. <br /><br />The new system takes into account price in BTC instead of USD in order for it to be universal given the new currency display additions. But that formula can be reconfigured for USD(or any currency), though one&#039;s calculation might be off a few cents when doing it that way. But it&#039;s a good enough, very close ballpark. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll post up a formula for USD. <br /><br />But the new system actually lowers commission for orders under $350, on par to slight increase for orders $350 to $500, then goes up incrementally over $600 to $1000 by about $1 to $8. It&#039;s the over $1000 orders where it pops up a bit. But in real currency terms, the increase is mostly minor, relatively speaking. Nothing someone who is buying bulk would cry over and consider a deal breaker.

				Just to clear up confusion about how the old fee system worked (which was a cumulative tier system):<br /><br />Here is the old Fee table:<br /><br />10% of first $50 (max $5) [meaning 10% for any order up to $50]<br /><br />8.5% of $50 - 150 ($5 + max addl $8.5) [Meaning, 10% of 1st 50 + 8.5% of value &gt;$50 to $150, not simply 8.5% of value of entire order that&#039;s between $50 and $150. Otherwise, a seller could just set order to $51 and save 1.5% in commission. Whereas the vendor listing for $49 would be paying more in commission. How would that be fair?]<br /><br />6% of $150 - 300 ($13.5 + max addl $9)<br /><br />3% of $300 - 500 ($22.5 + max addl $6)<br /><br />2% of $500 - 1000 ($28.5+ max addl $10)<br /><br />1.5% for everything over $1000 ($38.5 + 1.5% amt &gt;$1000)<br /><br />So for a $550 order, the fee was $28.5 + (2% of amt over $500 = (50 * .02 = $1) for a total of $29.5<br /><br />Why would SR charge a vendor selling something at $1001 less commission in dollar terms than the Vendor who sells something for $550? What sense of fairness is that? That&#039;s why commission schedules are cumulative. <br /><br />Perhaps some of the old time vendors can chime in to confirm how the old system was calculated. <br /><br />See this old thread about it. Look at the last few posts: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18636.msg209740#msg209740<br /><br />

I was having a hell of a time trying to adapt the formula to USD for listings pegged to USD. Now I see why. <br /><br />One thing, Listings pegged to USD from time of purchase to time of finalization would move commensurately with BTC value. So while the fee would also move with BTC valuation, so would the amount received in BTC at time of finalization (for unhedged orders). <br /><br />I just wish I could figure out some static percentage points along this new sliding commission schedule that can be relied upon. Any ideas how? <br /><br />Looking at your pic, not only does the percent change at certain points along the sliding scale relative to BTC, but the delta (rate of change) accelerates or decelerates with change in BTC.&nbsp; Am I seeing that right?

				My most expensive listing changed from a whopping 415 dollars to a........ $416 dollars.<br /><br />I for one, am appreciative of the recent updates. I am glad that SR is being updated as we move forward as a community.<br /><br />Remember the attacks a few months ago? Things have been running extremely well. 2 years and counting SR! I think we all owe a thank you to DPR.<br /><br /><br />Fuck the tiny commission raises. What really concerned me, was the lack of communication to the vendors that commissions were being raised. DPR, however, came out to quickly explain this, which I thought was respectable, which he always has been.<br /><br /><br />-TH<br /><br /><br />

He always made everything right, specially in hiring the right persons for the right positions.+<br />Now Scout is gone, the mod who always presented himself (at least to me) as a very reliable one. Never made any actions the community could suspect some kind of corruption. When he closed a thread he had very good reasons for it which he stated right away and always.<br />He lead the forum community that nice that most people took over his nice behavior and acted as part time moderators when somebody got out of line. <br /><br />Now scout is gone, for whatever reason. I miss him a lot. I never had anything to do with him (other than he declining rising my post to 50 so i dont have to spam :P) but i think he was very good for the forum community. In fact one of the best mods i have seen in my online career. Never use his status for personal reasons. Always gave a statement when it was needed. He made his job as good as inigo does. <br /><br />Now all of the sudden a new mod pops up, named libertas. The only thing he seems to do right is pasting wiki links around and suggests people, who have probably read that article more times than him, to look into them. The community highly dislikes that guy which everyone can see at the karma points given. <br />Now exactly this guy, who is very bad for the community (in my opinion) all of the sudden becomes sr support and takes care for the customers! <br /><br />Now if u want to look into the case of hazebusta who threatened me (this story will go public very soon, libertas agreed to it too), u will see what a character this guy has. its the worst character ive seen in the sr team yet. By far. <br /><br />Now all of the sudden its all downhill. The best mod gets exchanged with the worst. Like its not enough he now even takes care of real customers problems, money involved, maybe even humans death involved, in the very wrong way. This guy, in my opinion, is a very bad vibe seed and im sure if he continues his behavior it will be (actually already is) very bad for sr. <br /><br />Thats just how it is from my view. To give u an idea on why some people may have some concerns about sr. <br /><br />I think u shouldnt see it as a bad thing if your community takes a closer look if they suspect something. It can only be good. Better than ignoring everything and might have u in jail already and LE taking over...

				Dread Pirate Roberts, <br /><br />It&#039;s all good cap&#039;n. You really have no need to defend yourself. You explained the situation adequately. You didn&#039;t do anything wrong or underhanded. For wrong or underhanded, see Atlantis&#039;s fee schedule which masks as NOT being a cumulative schedule while being just that. That makes their fees seem to be much cheaper than on SR on initial inspection.&nbsp; They are cheaper though. But so what. <br /><br />Also, it&#039;s just that some of us are mathematically challenged and aren&#039;t quite at your level of mathematical genius. I mean, you used &quot;e&quot; in your new formula. I had to wiki that to be sure of what it was and how to use it on a calculator or spreadsheet. Yep, I&#039;m that math rusty. <br /><br />But so far I figured out a fair amount of data points along the new sliding commission scale. So I have a pretty good handle on what to expect fee wise within about $.025-$0.50 accuracy. For unhedged, USD pegged listings. <br /><br /><br /><br />Simple suggestion for all vendors to figure out new fee for any listing:<br /><br />1. Make a dummy listing. Name it &quot;Comm Test&quot; or something. Stealth it. Set shipping to 0. <br />2. Set a price. The one you are trying to figure commission for. Put in some nonsense in the description. Set quantity to 1<br />3. On the account page, Click settings and change your listing to pre or post commission pricing (opposite of what you normally have). <br />4. Refresh your listing page. Note the difference in price for your dummy listing after you changed&nbsp; how its displayed (pre or post comms).<br /><br />That&#039;s your fee.&nbsp; :) <br /><br />Easy peasy. <br /><br />Eventually someone will come up with a formula we can plug into Excel so we can do it one the fly. The formula DPR gave can be plugged into excel also but it works best when one bases everything on BTC. Making one for any particular fiat currency will be a challenge if the rate of change (delta) along the commission&#039;s sliding scale curve accelerates or decelerates relative to BTC value. In simple terms, unlike the old fee schedule which had thresholds, this new one doesn&#039;t, It just keeps sliding down incrementally from ~&lt;10% to below 4%. Except instead of thresholds, the rate of change of the percentage along the scale&#039;s curve decelerates the higher the price a listing is. <br /><br />Example:<br /><br />From $1 to $500, the % charged ranges from ~&lt;10% to ~6%. The rate of change is pretty fast<br />From $501 to $1000+ the % charged ranges from ~5.9% to &lt;4%. The rate of change is much slower. <br /><br />As Astor plotted out in post above, that&#039;s a parabolic like curve. <br /><br />*did some of y&#039;all just go cross-eyed?* LOL.

				Nice to know. It&#039;s really quite an honest system. Small time vendors get small fees so they can still make it by, and larger vendors making bank on SR pay a little more to keep SR and DPR going. All sounds good to me, I don&#039;t mind paying a little extra.

				Putting all this &quot;how much did the rates go up/down&quot; bickering aside, I do have to say that a commission rate that fluctuates depending on the price of bitcoins seems very strange to me.&nbsp; Like it or not, Bitcoins as a currency are way too volatile to post your listing based on BTC value.&nbsp; The vast majority of vendors peg it to USD, for good reason.<br /><br />As I understand it, with this new system if BTC swings wildly, so does the USD-based commission rate.&nbsp; That&#039;s not good design.<br /><br />I&#039;m open to correction if my interpretation of this formula is incorrect.

				Just wanted to say a few words....First thing, nothing last forever. Which I&#039;m pointing out on the change of mods of recent. Can&#039;t expect for someone to do one thing forever, as time goes by people have the need to advance and move on to bigger things or just feel exhausted of doing the same thing over and over again...I can only imagine the stress the cats go through who run this place...I can safely say that handling some customers is like handling a 6yr old kid. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s safe to say that DPR is just feeling a bit stressed with everything&#039;s that has been going on which is a natural reaction with any change that happens. And probably feeling a little irritated on some of the posts even though it probably wasn&#039;t intention make him look like someone he had no intention of being when posting this notice. It&#039;s a natural reaction and if any of us were in his shoes would react the same way to clear things up..<br /><br />The hike in commission in my opinion was bound to happen. As the market grows, and especially with the all the media that&#039;s been going around (There&#039;s always been but it&#039;s more than what it was a few months ago, and Atlantis isn&#039;t making it any better with it&#039;s thirst for members) I can only imagine that new members are finding it&#039;s way over to SR..And as that happens it&#039;s going to take more time and money to make sure this market that we love run in a way to please everyone. I don&#039;t know about you guys but I&#039;ve noticed for a month or so now that the site is actually running faster than it was 3 months ago.<br /><br />&nbsp;In conclusion, we all hate change especially when it comes to money but it is what it is, deal with it.&nbsp; :P The price hike will sting a little for the first few orders but, hey! It&#039;s the price we have to pay to enjoy this luxury we got going on here.&nbsp; And maybe some don&#039;t see it but what DPR got here is a business, sort of like a swap market/flea market and he&#039;s the landlord who rents out space and like in the real world we have to pay taxes.. <br /><br />

				DPR is more then a god for us.<br /><br />Show some respect your fucking fucks.<br /><br />the commission increased just in high priced items ( which is 0,1% of the traffic here) and people start loosing their minds. It&#039;s fucking pathetic.<br /><br />and to the guy criticizing Libertas, i respect your opinion, but Libertas is always helping people and is doing his job very well, as did scout. But scout left, deal with it. Libertas is great and i don&#039;t see anyone that should be in his position besides him.<br />

You really have no need to defend yourself. You explained the situation adequately. You didn&#039;t do anything wrong or underhanded. For wrong or underhanded, see Atlantis&#039;s fee schedule which masks as NOT being a cumulative schedule while being just that. That makes their fees seem to be much cheaper than on SR on initial inspection.&nbsp; They are cheaper though. But so what. <br /><br />Also, it&#039;s just that some of us are mathematically challenged and aren&#039;t quite at your level of mathematical genius. I mean, you used &quot;e&quot; in your new formula. I had to wiki that to be sure of what it was and how to use it on a calculator or spreadsheet. Yep, I&#039;m that math rusty. <br /><br />But so far I figured out a fair amount of data points along the new sliding commission scale. So I have a pretty good handle on what to expect fee wise within about $.025-$0.50 accuracy. For unhedged, USD pegged listings. <br /><br /><br /><br />Simple suggestion for all vendors to figure out new fee for any listing:<br /><br />1. Make a dummy listing. Name it &quot;Comm Test&quot; or something. Stealth it. Set shipping to 0. <br />2. Set a price. The one you are trying to figure commission for. Put in some nonsense in the description. Set quantity to 1<br />3. On the account page, Click settings and change your listing to pre or post commission pricing (opposite of what you normally have). <br />4. Refresh your listing page. Note the difference in price for your dummy listing after you changed&nbsp; how its displayed (pre or post comms).<br /><br />That&#039;s your fee.&nbsp; :) <br /><br />Easy peasy. <br /><br />Eventually someone will come up with a formula we can plug into Excel so we can do it one the fly. The formula DPR gave can be plugged into excel also but it works best when one bases everything on BTC. Making one for any particular fiat currency will be a challenge if the rate of change (delta) along the commission&#039;s sliding scale curve accelerates or decelerates relative to BTC value. In simple terms, unlike the old fee schedule which had thresholds, this new one doesn&#039;t, It just keeps sliding down incrementally from ~&lt;10% to below 4%. Except instead of thresholds, the rate of change of the percentage along the scale&#039;s curve decelerates the higher the price a listing is. <br /><br />Example:<br /><br />From $1 to $500, the % charged ranges from ~&lt;10% to ~6%. The rate of change is pretty fast<br />From $501 to $1000+ the % charged ranges from ~5.9% to &lt;4%. The rate of change is much slower. <br /><br />As Astor plotted out in post above, that&#039;s a parabolic like curve. <br /><br />*did some of y&#039;all just go cross-eyed?* LOL. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Best post in the thread. Helps out tremendously. <br /><br />+ Karma. <br /><br />Rather than trying to figure out how to adapt a formula for USD pegged listings, which will be quite the task, simply set your listings to pre-commission pricing. <br /><br />Since BTC is the intermediary, you won&#039;t be able to devise a proper formula to accurately calculate the commission rate unless you write a script that automatically obtains the current BTC/USD rate in which to plug in the formula. <br /><br />Simply, a crude estimate of what would represent the current rate in USD of the commission which can be deduced by the &quot;brute force, plug in and see&quot; method you prescribed above is all that is required to factor in your pricing pre-commission. As BTC value rises and falls relative to the buyer&#039;s fiat currency, your listings as from the point of view of the buyer will reflect the minor change in commission as influenced by the BTC fluctuation.&nbsp; <br /><br />One less calculation you have to make. Using pre-commission pricing now, you only need concern yourself with those things which affect your profit margin. Most of which are fixed costs. <br /><br />And to DPR. Kudos for coming up with a fair system that is not USD centric but BTC centric. BTC being the common denominator of all activities on here. <br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />From all of us at Pharmington Rex<br /><br />●ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ●<br /><br />The Gentleman Lords of Pharmaceuticals.<br />Serving US Patrons from within the US.<br /><br />●ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ●<br /><br />&nbsp;

Dollar terms. <br />Fixating on percents misses the real deal. <br /><br />On a $2000 order, under the new policy, the fee jumps up about $25 give or take depending where BTC is. Do you really think vendors or buyers are going to jump ship and run to Atlantis over $25 increase which may be adsorbed in part or entirely by the vendor? <br /><br />Seriously?<br /><br />Atlantis has been around for a few months with the same lower fees. Their client base only bumped up when SR was under massive attack in the spring and when SR was back up and running, so went their bump in client base. <br /><br />The nominal fee on bulk orders is being increased because guess what? Bulk vendors/buyers can afford it and aren&#039;t going to be phased over a net 1%-2% increase in price. They&#039;ve seen higher price increases by vendors who raise prices due to demand and still were unphased. <br /><br />Remember also that most bulk buyers aren&#039;t buying for personal consumption. So the minor dollar increase in cost will be amortized in their costs per gram or per pill. Which in many cases would only add a few pennies or nickles to their wholesale costs. <br /><br />Example: (simplified on purpose to illustrate a point about amortization)<br /><br />Buying 1000 pills of something @ $2000. Cost per pill is $2 - Sell pills local @ $5 - profit $3.5 - markup 150%<br />Buying 1000 pills of something @ $2025. Cost per pill is $2.03 - Sell pills local @ $5 - profit $3.47 - markup 146%<br /><br />Don&#039;t think anyone will be hurtin&#039; over it. <br /><br />

People selling btc for fiat are charged 0% because they cannot use the escrow.&nbsp; and people doing the opposite should be treated as exchangers as well.&nbsp; I agree that the margins on money exchanges are much too tight to be treated the same way.&nbsp;

				Lots of speculation about DPR here.&nbsp; ???<br />I am all for open discussion about changes and how they will effect us, but that is a far cry from some of the shit being talked here.<br /><br /><br />First off who are you to say what DPR should charge for his service? If you don&#039;t like it then use a different site. I don&#039;t mean this to be rude, but that is the way the free market works. DPR should raise the fees until he doesn&#039;t feel it is worth it anymore. When the SR began there were no fees to buy/sell here. Things change. It is his property and by complaining about the commissions you sound like someone who thinks they deserve the work of another man for less then he is willing to agree to.<br /><br />Personally, I like the straightforward way DPR put it over a year and a half ago: &quot;Whether you like it or not, I am the captain of this ship.&nbsp; You are here voluntarily and if you don&#039;t like the rules of the game, or you don&#039;t trust your captain, you can get off the boat.&nbsp; For those that stay, we at Silk Road will continue to do everything in our power to keep this market running smoothly and safely, and thank you again for your support!&quot; <br /><br />I believe he is acting the same as he always has. I posted the following in another thread but is sounds like some of you didn&#039;t see it. This is some of the history on the topic which I found on the forums. He has always taken it personal when people call him out for being greedy or question his right to set the commission as he sees fit.<br /><br /><br />----<br /><br /><br />&quot;Silkroad Fees&quot; from July 2011: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=986.0<br /><br />DPR made the following posts in that thread.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=986.msg10658#msg10658">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on July 27, 2011, 07:16 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">added to the seller&#039;s guide:<br /><br />&quot;...when pricing your items, be sure to include shipping and handling in the price.&nbsp; Whatever you set your price at will be your total compensation.&nbsp; However, your listings will display a price that is higher than the one you set because we add a commission to each listing.&nbsp; The commission is subject to change, but at the time of this writing it is 6.23%.&quot;<br /><br />Sorry for the opacity.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to share with you how I view money, so you can get a better idea of what to expect in regards to the management of Silk Road going forward.<br /><br />Money is a tool, a means to an end.&nbsp; Our end here at Silk Road is not the accumulation of money, or the comfort and security it brings (not that there&#039;s anything wrong with that).&nbsp; Our end is freedom from tyranny, and secured basic human rights for the people of the world.&nbsp; As awesome as it is, Silk Road is just the beginning in what will likely be a long journey.&nbsp; You can count on us to use the wealth created by it responsibly to produce ever more infrastructure and resources toward achieving these goals.&nbsp; In the end, it won&#039;t be about the money, it&#039;ll be about what we&#039;ve all achieved by thinking and acting for ourselves and refusing to compromise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=986.msg10824#msg10824">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on July 27, 2011, 09:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=986.msg10670#msg10670">Quote from: joeblow2 on July 27, 2011, 08:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Would this mean then that as the volume grows exponentially that there is a good chance that the fees will slide downward; both because of volume and the fact that there will be somewhat less to do in the way of major updates of the board because it will become both highly efficient and more bulletproof over time with each new iteration?&nbsp; Based on your philosophy of money (the tool part is the same as my own, however I do *love* the creature comforts that come from having it) I would be very interested to hear your answer, even if it is just in a philosophical bent rather than any estimation or indication of future fee structures.&nbsp; thanks!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not necessarily.&nbsp; Basically what I&#039;m saying is, MUCH more is possible than just being able to buy drugs freely.&nbsp; With the revenues from Silk Road (the more the better), we can invest in even more ambitious and revolutionary projects.&nbsp; Money is a tool, but so is Silk Road.&nbsp; Our aim is to one day live in a world where we won&#039;t need Silk Road, because we won&#039;t need to hide anymore.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />September 2011: What do you think about the new SR SELLER COMMISSION that&#039;s coming up?&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3415.0<br /><br />&quot;This is an automated message to all Silk Road sellers:<br /><br />Some of you are just joining us as sellers, others have been here since the beginning. Wherever you came into this game, I hope you are having fun :) For those just coming in, I want to give you a little history.<br /><br />Starting out, there were no commissions on sales. Sellers got 100% of what the buyer paid and there wasn&#039;t even a fee to become a seller! This might sound great for sellers, but paradoxically, I think things got much better when we started charging for accounts and adding a commission. Why? Because buyers had more reason to trust you and do business with you, and Silk Road finally had a revenue stream to invest in advanced server security and feature development.<br /><br />When we started charging a commission, I just picked a number, something like 5.25%. This was added on to every sale, so that sellers got what they listed the item for and buyers only saw one price. I was hoping this would give me the flexibility to change the commission rate at will without too much fuss from the community, but I soon found that many cared very much about this number, especially when I raised it by 1% to 6.25%.<br /><br />From my perspective, I would like this number to be as high as possible without causing sales to drop for you, but I have no idea where that point is. It could be 5%, 10% or even 20%, I just don&#039;t know. I&#039;m not saying we&#039;re amazon.com, but they charge a 15% commission on every item plus a flat $1.25 and I think ebay charges something like 13% if you take into account all of their fees.<br /><br />So, my proposal is to run an experiment. We&#039;ve been tracking sales data very closely for months and we&#039;re showing fairly steady linear growth. What I&#039;d like to do is double the commission rate to 12.5% for 1 month and see how sales respond to this. If our rate of growth slows, or even shrinks, then at least we&#039;ll know that it is too much and can scale it back, but if it doesn&#039;t affect sales, then we&#039;ll have doubled our revenue without any major consequence and can start investing in some of our &quot;back-burner&quot; projects such as internationalizing the site, developing an api, possibly starting an insurance pool, and getting normal updates and features online faster.<br /><br />This change will begin in 3 days unless I hear an overwhelming number of you respond negatively against it. Thanks for your time and for making Silk Road great :)<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road staff&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Jan 2012: State of the Road Address http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.msg76738#msg76738<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.msg76738#msg76738">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on January 09, 2012, 03:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />- From it&#039;s humble beginnings, the Silk Road market was quickly populated with what has become a vibrant community full of interesting characters.&nbsp; From our superstar vendors and ever helpful mods to all of the active folks on the forum, the people here are truly awesome.&nbsp; Silk Road would not be what it is or possibly even exist without everyone who has stepped up along the way to point out security flaws, contribute their ideas, and take this experiment on as their own and stand with us.<br /><br />It didn&#039;t take long before word got out.&nbsp; Our little hidden market got the attention of the media and soon the politicians and law enforcement.&nbsp; But Silk Road was never meant to be private and exclusive.&nbsp; It is meant to grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.&nbsp; We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so far tens of thousands have done so in the Silk Road market.&nbsp; A revolution has been born.&nbsp; So ideally, more participants means more prosperity.&nbsp; What we&#039;ve found in practice is that if there is an opportunity to cheat, steal or lie for personal short-term gain, someone, somewhere will exploit it.<br /><br />So, we&#039;ve had two major challenges to face as Silk Road grows and evolves.&nbsp; One is making our systems tough enough and flexible enough to withstand and win a cyber-war with the most powerful organizations in the world, should they choose to start that war.&nbsp; This is always and ever a top priority.&nbsp; The other is making the market a place where people can quickly and easily buy and sell just about anything without worrying about being attacked by gun toting men in uniforms and thrown in a cage or worry about being ripped off by their trading partner.<br /><br />I am proud to say we have been successful in achieving these goals up to this point.&nbsp; The site remains up and functioning (despite a few screw ups on our part, like not having a full capacity backup server ready to go when a live server went down, and a poorly executed url switch, just to name a few).&nbsp; And, over 99% of all transactions conducted within the escrow system are completed to the satisfaction of both both buyer and seller, or a mutually agreed upon resolution is found.<br /><br />This success has in no way made us complacent however.&nbsp; New members are still being lured into trading outside of escrow by scammers and getting ripped off, and “finalizing early”, effectively cutting out the escrow process, is common practice.&nbsp; Still, I believe we can mitigate these risks and take our market to the next level in security, reliability, performance, and convenience for everyone involved.<br /><br />First we must deal with trading out of escrow.&nbsp; Up to this point we have charged a flat 6.23% commission on all trades.&nbsp; This is much too high for transactions in the $300 and over range, making trading out of escrow for large transactions much more attractive than staying within the system.&nbsp; Now, instead of charging a flat commission, we will charge a higher amount for low priced items and a lower amount for high priced items, similar to how eBay does it.<br /><br />We&#039;ve worked hard to come up with a commission schedule that should work for everyone and will give scammers no excuse to make people send money outside of escrow.&nbsp; For some perspective, eBay and amazon charge the following rates:<br /><br />eBay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- $0.50 to list, 11% of the first $50, 6% of $50.01-1000, 2% of $1000.01+<br />amazon - $1.35 + 15% (for almost all items)<br /><br />We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.&nbsp; The average response looked like this:<br /><br />15% of the first $10<br />11% of $10 - $50<br />8.14% of $50 - $250<br />5.6% of $250 - $1000<br />3.7% of $1000 - $5000<br /><br />We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:<br /><br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /><br />With this change, there are no phoney excuses whatsoever for vendors to ask for out of escrow payment.&nbsp; Any request should be interpreted as a scam attempt and reported to the Silk Road support team via the “contact us” link on the main site.&nbsp; We are looking at several mechanisms for enforcing the ban on OOE transactions, from self-policing to bounties on offenders.<br /><br />Together, we can beat the scammers and make the Silk Road market a place where you can buy with confidence and peace of mind.&nbsp; If we stay true to our principles of integrity, virtue, mutual respect and camaraderie that have guided us to this point, I believe our future is bright and this revolutionary experiment will be a success!<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQEbBAEBAgAGBQJPCl0BAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olWDsH9jGBcHVl302TYnOpD/oc2G9w<br />ZN1H56v/oRww3het2ESSUokjfoU3JFs5442eNvvNQohHlN3Z2gVBpm4c7BQKVBTB<br />IlfjalIMr1bzMtjVzvwV+CJSF7KHrz91eUDICtpOgNIVQ36CxYA1c9cjHuOVVNbU<br />6N6qVycC4TS2Oy38DUJlYm5UsLcxTqQhlLkiXuUH3uOMp7pwLfPlDmrz4nojWooq<br />FwQ6JBFuMG5/wO0NcKgP4hXWcAmo24oGbaC6/5jUjQ7ze7ILsZf7ykeOi3O3ZhyG<br />n2WyY5+99dc39kviJhIwQfvu8VWaDlYBgvh3PlDENIYD4ThgAzdUoW0Nha4LXA==<br />=wI/M<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />CLARIFICATION:&nbsp;

I chose the words I wrote in the Address very carefully.&nbsp; I reviewed it many times.&nbsp; Every one of them is true, and my sentiment is valid.&nbsp; Go through and re-read it along with the clarifications.&nbsp; Every one of your concerns is addressed if you would only do me the courtesy of believing me.&nbsp; This change IS about scam prevention.&nbsp; We ARE working on solutions to the finalizing early and bitcoin exchange scams.&nbsp; We DID do everything we could to keep the rates low while still addressing the present and future needs of the organization.&nbsp; Everyone WILL be treated fairly under the new rules just as you have been all along.<br /><br />We also need to be WAY more flexible on this kind of stuff.&nbsp; It would be amazing if we could try out lots of different commission rates, some way too high, some way too low, to try to find out what works for everyone, but the minute we even mention changing rates everyone becomes an expert on the subject and puts up resistance to change.&nbsp; There is lots about this organization that just isn&#039;t going to be made public and you have to TRUST us that we are doing our absolute best and will always work toward our stated goals, which include giving people the opportunity to choose freedom over tyranny, and to trade in just about any good or service they wish, securely and privately.&nbsp; Our goals DO NOT include profiting personally at anyone else&#039;s expense, or the expense of our stated goals.&nbsp; If I am greedy, I am greedy for freedom.&nbsp; I am greedy for power.&nbsp; Not force over others, but for a world where POWER resides in me and each and every individual, where it belongs.&nbsp; If we can get to that world, I can die happy.<br /><br />Silk Road is an ENTERPRISE that is just getting started.&nbsp; It could literally change the world as we know it.&nbsp; It is bigger than any one of us, and it is going to take the dedication and will of MANY talented people, a lot of luck, and RESOURCES to get from here to there.&nbsp; Do you want to see this thing go all the way and take the absolute piss out of the power mongers of this world?&nbsp; Do you want to give it every chance it needs to succeed?&nbsp; Why aren&#039;t you telling me to raise the commission even further then?&nbsp; I don&#039;t hear anyone refusing the commission break on high priced goods.&nbsp; I don&#039;t hear anyone saying “don&#039;t do that, you need it, you keep this whole thing going, we&#039;re happy to do our part.”<br /><br />As a community, if we are going to survive, we need to adopt a LONG TERM vision.&nbsp; Getting the most out of this thing before it gets taken down is NOT going to bring us success.&nbsp; In that world, Silk Road will be a&nbsp; shooting star that burns out quickly and dies as little more than a dream, swallowed by the nightmare reality of an ever-expanding, all-powerful global oligarchy.&nbsp; Planning ahead and doing everything we can NOW to prepare for the war to come is the only way we are going to have a shot at this.&nbsp; We are still mostly ignored by our true enemies, but this incubation WILL NOT last forever.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like writing this kind of stuff publicly because it taunts our enemies and might spur them into action, but I risk it because the context for what we are doing is too often lost in the day to day stuff that happens here and it needs to be put in from time to time.&nbsp; Silk Road NEEDS our support.&nbsp; It needs everything we have.&nbsp; The return on what we put into it will be immeasurable if we can get through the months and years ahead and gain a real foothold on the global stage.&nbsp; HELP ME GET US THERE!!!&nbsp; Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind.<br /><br />P.S.<br />Here&#039;s another thing that doesn&#039;t get said enough:&nbsp; I love you.&nbsp; This is the most fun I&#039;ve ever had and I feel closer to the people I have met here than the vast majority of people I have to hide all of this from in real life.&nbsp; Stay light, have fun, and please please please take this on as more than a way to score drugs.&nbsp;

In reality, Silkroad&#039;s success (and the success of all online free markets) is dependent on public confidence; so regardless of what people here may think, SR can be shut down. I guess if he&#039;s already prepared to truly put himself in the cross-hairs of people who have such power / motivation, then I shouldn&#039;t be worried. But it seems like creating a free market is already a giant step, and managing that free market as it grows and grows seems like it would be so time-consuming. In any case, the fees for more expensive items were a bit low, with that, and the fact that this new system makes more sense, there&#039;s really no one complaining.<br /><br />From DPR&#039;s perspective, maybe what&#039;s upsetting is when people know what the money is going towards, and yet still complain when fees are changed. But it goes back to vendors falling into a routine that makes it seems like all of this is just normal.

				DPR I really think a change like this could of been done a lot better, Silkroad needs a intricate hybrid business model to create a competitive advantage. Right now SR only has their core business that consists of the man behind a curtain and core distributors. If you compare silkroad to any major software company&#039;s silkroads growth has been much different, a perfect example is shutting down the the secondary weapons site for being a non monetary revenue stream that has a monopoly on anonymous online sales in a market that is around 60 billion a year and just after you have sandy hook every news channel pushing gun bans and every one in the USA hoarding magazines and guns essentially every major news channel was advertising the deepweb with gun ban scares. Utilizing a 20 something year old stoner who lives in his moms basement and spends each day browsing 4chan and does freelance coding on the side you could of had abstract data produced showing that the media and governments worldwide are pro gun control.<br />A big investment in software is needed to do this for Silkroad but of course in greater depth a program that is capable of modeling even hierarchies, event abstraction, event pattern detection, abstracting event based processes and detecting relationships. This software is very effective at providing correlation to situations which would allow us to improve are key performance indicators.<br /><br />So we changed the revenue model by increasing fees with the ultimate goal of increasing profit, with the new system silkroad earns a minimum of 4% from vendors who do around 25 million in business a year. The worldwide&nbsp; size of this market is around 300-350 billion and 1% of the world GDP. Even if the silkroad fee was 100% of the vendor sales they would be nothing in relation to the possible profits! Their are many internal opportunities to increase the revenue well maintaining minimum costs. Due to the nature of this business and bitcoins their can not be complete end to end control on the incoming revenue these loses can be quite significant, the high profit time when silkroad dominates the market will cum to an end just like the internet porn industry, alternative more advanced means of tracking revenue must be implemented to remain profitable.<br /><br />To increase the number of users their are a few things that need to be changed I would say the most important to be their directors of silkroad that are paid in bitcoin to improve Silkroad DPR could privately contact people who&nbsp; have the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in a way to guide action to the desired goal. Anarchism is based on the fact one person can not do everything to perfection otherwise we would all be in favor of dictatorships. One way of greatly increase the numbers of users is a p2p silkroad based currency that pays dividends this would fulfill the human desire for long term trusting relationships which is part of human nature and has been displayed in many attachment theory tests. Media attention will eventually stop and to maintain growth new and innovative ideas will have to be implemented.<br /><br /><br /><br />

The gun-control scare did alarm quite a few Americans, but we&#039;re talking about normal Americans. With this economy, the majority of them would not be willing to break the law to buy something so expensive. Increasing growth isn&#039;t about innovative ideas; especially since SR has no competition. Simply keeping this website open will increase the amount of news coverage (that&#039;s not going away). With the younger generations becoming more &amp; more tech savvy, growth is guaranteed.

And so far they&#039;ve gone nowhere.<br /><br />Those numbers are from the UNODC and I believe its the final retail price, its been a long time since I have seen the actual publications their still out their of course and are quite detailed if you want to check. People have been selling drugs online for over 20 years yet its never really blown up, until their are cartels with websites I would say its smaller scale. Its getting more attention now then it ever has but still is not really catching on. Educating people about something is extremely expensive and not very effective, no large business ever wastes money on advertising through education for example if you live in Canada you constantly see the TD bank comparing their banking to a comfortable chair, If posting fliers saying hey were TD bank and if you would like to join us just come drop on by worked they would do that and save millions the AAF would not exist and their would not be doctorate programs for advertising. It is a complex art which demands knowledge of human nature and creativity. Detailed guides on how TOR functions have been available for years any one who has a computer can access it and if you put buy drugs online into any search engine only about the first 1000 news articles are about silkroad. Silkroad is big because its creation was innovative it was a new solution to a demand, their is a huge market left untapped though and its going to take a new solution to get them onto the deepweb. You will find&nbsp; their is a strong correlation to success and innovation IE a homeless person making a crack pipe from tinfoil is a low level of innovation and is uncreative and required basic primate knowledge to find the solution to his problem when compared to a superbowl add which is the biggest you can really go you see high levels of innovation, these are the people who set trends and work for recognizable brands, they pay about 1 million for 10 seconds of TV time for the super bowl and honestly I think I walk away from them dumber than before I watched them but it works. Silkroad is no longer unique and could easily become a thing of the past look at what happened to myspace. You also completely contradict yourself saying innovation is not needed then saying a website is not successful because of its lack of innovation, its literally the exact same layout as silkroad. You have agreed with me but just said it backwards. it failed because it was not innovative vs it was not innovated so it failed. They both have the same meaning bud.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t think the armory should be re-opened for reasons that have to do with selling a gun without looking someone in the eyes, but putting that aside; any illegal firearms would be extremely expensive, it would take time for vendors to setup accounts, and any issues with scams would immediately turn off new buyers.

Increasing growth isn&#039;t about innovative ideas; especially since SR has no competition. Simply keeping this website open will increase the amount of news coverage (that&#039;s not going away). With the younger generations becoming more &amp; more tech savvy, growth is guaranteed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If it was linked to silkroad like it should of been I could set up shop the day of since i&#039;m already a vendor. Guns are relatively cheap they start&nbsp; under $500 for a reliable one ak-47s usually sell for around $400 at gun shows and&nbsp; are considered one of the best rifles ever produced by many&nbsp; even people on minimum wage could buy one heck even a coke addicts one day budget could get you a few. They can also be quite expensive which is good for business as it adds variety, theirs also is a large market for guns I personally have always kept an assault weapon in the house ever since my late teens and currently own a Military issue HK416 with a compm4 scope and a bc100mag I have spent a bit over $7000 on it which is nothing to be able to know the day some biker gang decides to break down my door I will be able to take them all out with little to no resistance, you cant put a price on the emotion freedom and security gives you. Theirs also scams on silkroad but we do not shut that down drug addicts are often compulsive liars its been proven many times the use of certain drugs causes impulsive behavior&nbsp; &nbsp;just ask any one who has sold heroin on silkroad. Your accept the risk when you decide to join the whole point of the website is to give people the freedom to choose and theirs no reason for their to be an increase in scams as long as its treated the same as silkroad. Also according to the FBI their are over 200 million privately owned firearms in the USA its known as the most gun loving nation around it also has more people in jail than any other country and I personally know many people who purchase illegitimate weapons all the time it would be perfect for the large crowd of people who are looking for specialized equipment. It failed before because it was so dissociated from the mainsite and silkroad was prioritized over it, theirs nothing inherently dishonest about selling self defense tools. Most of the people I know who sell guns or own many guns are good people who would never scam any one. Its actually the people who do not have the guns that where doing all the scamming which is a bit ironic. A simple requirement like providing a picture with your vendor name would stop most of the scams.<br /><br />Also the business model you proposed is crazy if you worked in any corporate office you would be fired on the spot for saying something like that and it has yet to work once in recorded history,in knowledge economy which is considered the latest stage of development in the global economic economy things which are innovative are inherently valuable. Knowledge is not a limited resource for example right click on silkroad view the page save it in word and upload to the host of your choice good job on making your very own silkroad! Theirs absolutely nothing proprietary about it and you already said their where websites doing the same thing once again contradicting yourself. Also the becoming tech savy thing was a thing in your parents generation every one can use a computer that lives in a first world country they have been in school systems for more than 20 years. I remember 15 years ago people used IRC to sell drugs that was always small time budmail a website you can access on the clearnet sells weed and is also quite small. Everything you say is opinion based and often contradicts things you said just before. If your going to argue based on opinion you should at least do some type fact check and argue strong points. Also nothing stays in the news for long IE Clinton who received probably 1000x more news coverage than silkroad has and has not been mentioned in ages I could go on and on about how quickly the media dumps information when its no longer new. I think you are getting confused because the only news you choose to pay attention to is related to silkroad so you think its the only news. Did you know that one of the main forces behind a market economy is the media that did reports on silkroad these are all interlocking forces.

				You actually made one point I think might be correct under certain circumstances, Innovation has no relation to profit in a communist society as their is no profit motive or benefits of being intelligent im sure you would love it especially their easy to understand media.

From the time DPR said 1btc to today ($130), all vendors unknowingly suffered over a 20% fee increase for those items between $400 and $1000. This probably covers most of the items currently sold on the market for roughly a 25% increase in immediate revenue for site admin. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As far as my monetary net worth is concerned, the future value of Silk Road as an organization dwarfs its and my liquid assets. … I wouldn’t sell out for less than 10 figures, maybe 11</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Suppose the average US vendor buys a product on the street, lists it on SR for $350, and make 4 sales. Then he cashes out via vendor gold for the $1000 listing for $1,253.40. He get charged ~8.5% sale fee, another ~25% cashout fee (of which 5.86% goes again to SR). <br />4*350=$1400<br />-$119 for SR fees<br />-$180 for Gold (high due to high exchange rate on SR)<br />-$73 for Gold&#039;s SR fees<br />So after all that work, the vendor received $1000 in cash + $28 in his SR balance. The effective tax rate is 26% of revenue (while corporate taxation is based on profit). For comparison the US Federal Government charges an income tax at 26% for the highest earning bracket. <br /><br />The barrier to entry at this point for a vendor to do legitimate business here is already sufficiently high. As a self proclaimed libertarian and someone who&#039;s in for the long hall (according to Forbes interview), DPR should know better than to tax like this. <br /><br />DRP, you really need to think about the long term and macroeconomic implications of your fee structure. Not only will it be forced to change in the next btc bubble, it won&#039;t allow SR to reach the 11 figure evaluation you were hoping for.

				So you up the commission, change the BTC engine so you gain more Bitcoins that can be sold for a higher price than what they&#039;re actually listed as (I had no problem selling $2000+ at Mt. Gox) , what are you going to do next? You already have enough money to last your lifetime, and probably 20 others since you don&#039;t have to pay taxes. Why in the hell do you need more?

				You&#039;re a fucking stupid hippy? What&#039;s cool? Who gives a fuck what&#039;s cool, what are you going to do with a billion dollars? Sit there and look at it, that&#039;s pretty much all you can do with it. Unless you want to kill yourself doing so much drugs and become a stupid beverly hills ignorant bitch until you die.

				A simple question, surely answered somewhere, but I cannot find it. Are shipping charges also subject to commission? Or just tacked onto the vendor&#039;s payout after commission is charged on the item&#039;s price? I&#039;m assuming shipping is subject to commission, or else we would see listings for $1 items with $999 shipping, but if someone could confirm my assumption, I should feel quick gratitude, to borrow a phrase from Emily Dickinson.<br /><br />Mr. Winky Doodle: Do you need a hug? Or what is your issue exactly?
