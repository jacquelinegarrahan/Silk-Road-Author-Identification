				Put in 1 address in 3 different boxes for Automatic Withdrawl and I was wondering where my bitcoins were going and why I was only getting a couple of bitcoins rather than the amount I was supposed to get.&nbsp; I then messaged vendor support and asked them where my coins have gone.&nbsp; They responded with random addresses I have NEVER used and dont know what addresses they are.&nbsp; I then went onto blockchain to see where the coins were going.&nbsp; It appears they have sent the coins to their own address and have sent them to another address or sold them.&nbsp; I am requesting my money back but they are refusing to give me my coins!!&nbsp; Beware people/vendors.&nbsp; They can do whatever they want with your coins.&nbsp; Withdraw AS SOON as you get coins.&nbsp; They cannot be trusted.

				If they sent the coins to an address, and then the coins were moved again (let me guess, in two transactions?), it sounds like they are still in the tumbler.

				You should talk to them some more, maybe just wait a bit. There are couple million worth of BTC going through SR every month. I doubt they would just start stealing small amounts of individuals customers. Especially just from one person, as I haven&#039;t heard of anyone else actually getting their money taken by SR. Either your coins are still on their way or they made a mistake. Work with them, if you start acting paranoid and calling them thieves you probably aren&#039;t going to get very far.

				OK Beans.......you seemed quite calm and fine in chat earlier today.<br />Why did you not mention this to me ?<br />You know I&#039;m the first person to talk to on these types of issues.<br />You and Larghetto were poking at each other over something but I was not paying attention.<br /><br />Let me assure you that SR/Vendor Support did nothing to your BTCs and this reeks of a jumping to a conclusion. I&#039;m 99% sure your account is/was compromised. Have you even considered your setup isn&#039;t as secure as you assume it is?<br /><br />Are you sure losing roughly $375 dollars is worth falsely accusing SILK ROAD of embezzlement and you losing many customers which would cause you to lose even more money? You might want to think calmly on situations of this type and look at it from all the points of view. Never has Silk Road been proven to have stolen any btcs from any vendor, my would they, you think their fees are not adding up enough they need to blindly rob a mere -400$ from a vendor?<br /><br />Your scenario makes no sense. Mine on the other hand is that a level headed and common sense pov.<br /><br />Reset your pin and password and turn off automatic withdraw.<br />The more you argue about this the worst you will look mate. I tell you this out of experience and respect.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad bloodbath
