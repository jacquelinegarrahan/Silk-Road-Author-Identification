				Fuck yeah!<br /><br />I required an order to be sent within the claimed 24hr time frame and about an hour before I was allowed to cancel it the vendor shipped it after seven days or so, thereby making me lose the window of time I had to receive the order at the destination and asked me to &quot;FE so he could ship my order&quot; and when I said I will FE when you confirm an address change he turns around and claimed to have already shipped it to the address I had already given him.<br /><br />Why would a vendor ask me to FE so they can send it only to then send it prematurely without any discussion about it whatsoever?<br /><br />It&#039;s ok to wait one or two days but anything more than that should be stated clearly in the vendors profile. or discussed with the buyer and the buyers given the choice to cancel.<br /><br />Recently, I was given the run around by one vendor with regards to an order that was placed a week before he marked item as shipped, but I instantly had the opportunity to cancel my order from my previously used weed vendor who incidentally shipped rubbish and I wish I had!<br /><br />As for a certain Australian weed vendor, he says to you he&#039;s shipped your order by Express Post that has guaranteed next day delivery, while using previously used Express Post envelopes, and then blames the PO when it takes 6 business days to arrive, all the while you&#039;re getting deliveries from eBay from all over the country in at least a third of the time this person takes often by regular post.<br /><br />His weed the other days was terrible and I won&#039;t order from them again, but vendors should not say something is shipped when it isn&#039;t either because people that order from certain places regularly know the shipping times required from vendors claimed location, and when something that should take 7-10 days is taking closer to 21-28 days or more, it&#039;s entirely vendor negligence and without compensation these types of activities do not deserve a 5/5 reference from the buyer unless he&#039;s sucking up the vendor in questions ass for some reason.<br /><br />This is definitely a right people should have especially if they&#039;ve spent a certain amount or had a certain amount of successful shipments.<br /><br />It seems sometimes the forums have more regulation than the main site itself!

				Is there a reason why cancellations have a wait period? Is SR losing money/resources with cancelled orders?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to shave a day off the wait, but it&#039;s not a very major thing, and doesn&#039;t inhibit the SR experience for me.

I believe the logic behind the 4 day wait is so that a customer doesn&#039;t cancel the order between the time it&#039;s shipped and the time the vendor gets back to a computer to confirm it&#039;s shipped.

				^correct.<br /><br />Anyway, I take any claims of time-to-ship with a grain of salt.&nbsp; It&#039;s been my experience that sometimes you will place an order right when the vendor is receiving/processing their orders, and other times you will place an order right after they have processed the orders, and will have to wait until they process them next.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree that vendors shouldn&#039;t advertise that they ship within, say, 24 hours, unless they actually process orders every 24 hours, but on the other hand, we&#039;ll never know and there ain&#039;t jack shit we could do to &quot;enforce&quot; this.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s best to just be patient.&nbsp; If I absolutely must have something within a short amount of time, and I&#039;m looking on SR, then I have already failed miserably in planning.
