				Imgur doesn&#039;t let you upload over Tor. The people posting those drug pics must be doing it over clearnet or with VPNs, but VPNs aren&#039;t safe.<br /><br />Minus.com lets you upload over Tor. Just keep it on the DL and don&#039;t fuck it up for everyone. :)<br />

				I spoke with the people over at mediacru.sh and they are considering allowing uploads over TOR. If you guys email them also it might become more likely. <br /><br />Mediacrush:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We&#039;re considering doing TOR, but we really can&#039;t afford to become a hive of CP.

				What are you looking to upload? I have a phpBB site on Tor that I recently installed that can allow password protection for individual threads and you can upload images and files. It&#039;s basically set up like this forum, but you can start your own thread and put a username and password on it, IIRC. <br /><br />The only thing is, an admin would have to set up the password, so an admin would have access to it. Unless, of course, you encrypted it.. I am still getting the hang of all of the features of it so you may have to bear with me. <br /><br />If there&#039;s another software package that would suit your needs, I could install that. (Open source only, GNU license) <br /><br />PM me, and let me know if i can be of assistance.&nbsp; You can do PMs here, right? If not, you can go right to it and register (you can use a fake email) and PM me there. I set it so that new users have access to all features. My Public Key is listed there if you wish to use it. <br /><br />http://lgboo2eqyx2pasch.onion/phpBB3/index.php
