				This morning, one of the most-read papers in my country published a frontpage article, along with a 4-page manual on buying coke/mephedrone on SR, for every 12-year old to read and (ab)use.<br /><br />We now have the undivided attention of Europol, EMCDDA and the computer crime unit.<br />Also, the organized crime units are on it.<br /><br />Coke was bought from a dutch vendor (I don&#039;t know which one), claiming it was 81% pure.<br />After analysis only 10% was found :S Who was this vendor anyway? :P<br /><br />(S)(B)ad times ahead people...<br /><br />Love

				Wondering who the vendor was who was a bit... light on the coke content? That might be enough of a disincentive for would be noobs to join up - if the perception is that SR vendors are &quot;jipping&quot; people. And there&#039;s always the chance that the author of the article is lying as a means of dissuading people from engaging in SR. <br /><br />The brave new souls that disregard that, will find the opposite to be true. Can&#039;t beat the quality of SR vendor products.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know the few vendors I deal with have been nothing but excellent with pure, potent product. <br /><br />As for that article bringing more heat, maybe not. It&#039;s not like LE doesn&#039;t know about SR and read that article and were suddenly enlightened. <br /><br />At this point, to bring the heat, you probably need to have something bad happen to someone who acquired product off SR. In fact, a lot of someones. A very public takedown works best when there&#039;s public awareness. Imagine if LE were able to takedown SR now. Who in the general public would really care? Who in the general public even knows about SR? So it wouldn&#039;t be a real feather in the cap to take SR down. At least not yet. <br /><br />IF anything, perhaps a bit more surveillance and data/intel collection on the part of LE. But this news item doesn&#039;t ring as anything that would be a call to arms for LE.&nbsp;

				I seriously think that Osama Bin Ladens ghost could make a global announcement that he will be trafficking opiates to children through SR to fund global jihad, and some how people on SR would find some way to convince themselves that LE doesn&#039;t care and will still not become involved.

				@kmfkewm<br /><br />I don&#039;t think anyone on SR thinks LE doesn&#039;t care. It&#039;s just that taking down SR requires manpower and a sizable budget. LE knows that if they simply opt to knock it down, it is highly likely to pop up again. A game of whack a mole is not in their best interest. <br /><br />What they probably want, they can&#039;t readily get. That&#039;s going after the creator of SR. Head of the serpent type thing. Or go after a significant amount of buyers to create FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) as to the security measures people take to try to hide their identity. And of course, there&#039;s always the option of going after the vendors. Though, that might not have the desired effect since other vendors would step up to take their place. Plus they&#039;d only catch the &quot;dumb&quot; vendors - aka, the low hanging fruit. <br /><br />It&#039;s a hard task that can&#039;t easily be justified by any LEO at this time. So, they&#039;re relegated to watching and waiting for the time being.

				That&#039;s the kind of unwanted attention we could do without? When is some journalist from High Times or Rolling Stone or for that matter Adbusters going to do a positive story given how fucked up the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; have turned out. Come on Libertarians. Something positive please! .....Peace

				my point exactly.<br />In my country, this article is going to lead to:<br />1. Increased purchase of &quot;drooogz&quot; on SR by youngsters<br />2. Increased intake of those youngsters in our ER departments<br />3. Possible deaths being linked to SR-purchases<br />4. Governments OBLIGED to take action because they cannot ignore the drug/SR-related casualties.<br /><br />As long as the community remained &quot;small&quot;, &quot;educated&quot; in (safely) using drugs, there is no problem.<br />The real problem comes when inexperienced youngsters start flipping out/dying on drugs bought on SR.<br />Our government simply cannot ignore those things anymore.<br />I hope I&#039;m just being the pessimist, but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m being a realist. *big sigh*<br /><br />I seriously wonder about journalism ethics in my country. It makes me angry. And sad.<br /><br />And what we really DON&#039;T need is US/EU/Interpol cooperating on shutting down our darkweb.<br />If there&#039;s a global incentive for shutting us down, this place will be gone before you can say &quot;whoop&quot;.<br /><br />Enzyme: I saw you registered today. Buy any droogz yet? ;-p

				wow that&#039;s crazy! I knew it was blown up in the media already but I wish there was a way to keep SR from selling to young kids but that&#039;s impossible. I guess it&#039;s a new day and age and kids are learning quicker and well if they want something they are going to find it regardless if over the net on in person. I trust SR to protect us though to a certain point but pgp and little other things can get people in trouble I realize and not SR fault

				Meh, another article another day. Yet another reason to use PGP, investigate every Vendor you consider buying from, and keep your business private.<br /><br />~Digi<br /><br />
