				i am fairly new here.. been around for a few months but i really dont understand why vendors are allowed to require FE? doesnt that defeat the whole purpose of escrow and silkroad? especially when i am reading a vendor page with 90% positive feedback out of 115 transactions&nbsp; &nbsp;that means atleast 15 or so people were not happy with the purchase.. and i am reading the feedback&nbsp; and itt is saying people were scammed.. why can he still require FE? i would love to order from said vendor but not with FE.. yeea i know i dont have to order but i just dont really understand it

				Scams can go both ways - It takes no initial investment to create a new Buyer account, place an order and then deny that it was ever received demanding a refund or leveraging a 1/5 rating hit. <br /><br />I don&#039;t condone FE and I had to do it once when I started out. Build your Buyer stats slowly with small purchases of non drug related items or work it out with a vendor via PM (Most are very helpful to new customers) -- If they demand FE either comply or move your business elsewhere. <br />

				Vendors have to meet a threshold before they can ask for FE and it is just that &quot;ask&quot; I chose to decline and look for a different vendor when I was new I could understand as a lot of new buyers will wreck a vendors feedback because they really didn&#039;t know what to expect in the transaction and blame the vendor of any misfortunes..... just look at the &quot;so and so is a scammer&quot;threads... postal&nbsp; packages get seized lost delayed ..errors get made in addresses. All of these are possible and if you are dealing with a reputable vendor they are then called selective scammers.... ever think that this is not a perfect system but one I am willing to put my faith in....but then again I don&#039;t FE. New vendors CAN&quot;T request FE they must be a member for 30 days and have 35+ transaction. I would like to see these numbers increased to 90 days and 90 transactions... abit harder to pad a vendors account to set up a scam.&nbsp; I see no reason SR should facilitate an early date to allow FE

				&quot;Build your Buyer stats slowly with small purchases of non drug related items&quot;<br /><br />That is the WORST advice. We can see that you are doing that and it makes ZERO sense..BUT the next line is the BEST advice..<br /><br />&quot;work it out with a vendor via PM (Most are very helpful to new customers)&quot;<br /><br />There are more scamming buyers then vendors. The reason FE is allowed is because it is a free market. It is not allowed by new vendors with less then 55 sales. Though some do it. If you see it..report it to SR as there is not a system in place that won&#039;t allow it...meaning it is not like the system shuts you out until you hit 55 sales. It is just told that you cant do it. And some new vendors ask for FE and when get called out act like they didn&#039;t know(complete bullshit). <br /><br /><br />Bottom line is this...Don&#039;t FE if you do not want to. Move on. There are plenty of vendors. YOU make the decision. You are never forced to FE. I have yet to see where the only option is a vendor that requires FE. So shop around. Just remember to finalize as soon as you get your drugs. Nothing worse then a buyer who wants over nite service then takes 2-3 days to finalize.<br /><br />I can say that even though I am against it...that some vendors must do it or they will just get scammed. Meaning they can&#039;t ship with DCN and so the buyer knows that..and the buyer will claim he did not receive the package and try and get a refund or re ship. Trust me it happens more then you think. Again the beautiful thing is there is always a choice. So pick yours. But just because you don&#039;t like it does not mean it should not be an option.

				If a new vendor asks you to FE, should that be reported?&nbsp; I know that the finalize option isn&#039;t even available for a few days for new vendors but they might say, &quot;wait until finalize shows up.&quot;

				YES REPORT IT!!!!<br /><br />Fe is available as soon as&nbsp; a vendor marks &quot;in transit&quot;. And they are not supposed to mark &quot;in transit&quot; until it is actually shipped.<br /><br />New vendors with less then 55 feedback&#039;s are not allowed to ask buyers to FE. In doing so they are risking losing there vendor account.<br /><br />So report them to Silk Road.<br /><br />Thank You

				no problem - i just wanted to make sure people knew what the current requirement is<br /><br />i dont know where 55 came from, maybe there was a point when it was 55, and i know some people would prefer it be 55 or even more<br /><br />when i became a mod i specifically asked the admins about it because i had vendors inquiring - and they told me they agreed upon 35

				I suppose this would be a good time to introduce myself as a vendor that is against FE. I will never ask you too. As a buyer I have lost about 2 grand because of that shit. Everyone deserves escrow. That policy will remain after 35 transactions is met. The way I see it. If your mailing international you cant track it. Where I am. So deny the order. Only sell local where you can track.

				Having to FE is fucking stupid and I don&#039;t understand why SR is taking the stance of the vendors. It&#039;s even more stupid if you consider that you&#039;re only allowed to ask for FE if you got a certain amount of sales at which point a negative rating shouldn&#039;t hit you as hard anyway. If no one were allowed to ask for fe everyone would lose like 3 rating points and we&#039;d be done with it.<br /><br />I really have to laugh every time I see something like this.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5/5 package never arrived and didn&#039;t get a refund<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you&#039;re confident in your product and you ability to deliver you shouldn&#039;t be worried about negative feedback.

				To be honest, I totally understand all of your concerns.<br />But on the other side I think, that people should have the option to &quot;fe&quot; if they want to.<br /><br />There aren&#039;t only &quot;drug-related&quot; offers on the SR market.<br />For instance let&#039;s say someone wants to send a &quot;legal&quot; package and seems to be &quot;trustworthy&quot;,<br />it should be the buyer&#039;s choice if he / she wants to &quot;fe&quot;.<br /><br />In my opinion future buyers should carefully read the vendors&#039; listings and profile to determine if they want to make use of his / hers offer / service and if not, there are other vendors out there, therefore feel free to seek that one who&#039;s best suited to your needs.<br /><br />Of course if a vendor requires you to &quot;fe&quot;, he must declare it, so that&#039;s visible to every potential buyer.

				There is a big difference in a consumer wanting to fe to help out the vendor or whatever. Compared to a vendor forcing them to in order to receive product. If a customer volunteers or is completely ok with trusting that ven than its their discretion. Most of those fe vendors can be swayed anyways. I have gotten atleast half dozen to make an exception to their policy. I just think it is unethical to allow any merchant to force a customer into a position to be potentially robbed or defrauded.
