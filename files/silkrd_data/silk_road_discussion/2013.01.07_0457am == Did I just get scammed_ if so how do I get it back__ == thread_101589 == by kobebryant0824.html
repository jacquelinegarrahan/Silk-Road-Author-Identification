				So this guy 5hunna500 listing all just dissapeared<br /><br />His main profile is now non exsistance<br /><br />Earlier in the day he had a few good feedbacks recently <br /><br />I noticed he had a total of about 65 transaction with 100% feedback<br /><br />Today when I try to click on his name, I would only allow to send him a message. When I try to view his main page it would only allow me to send him a message. When I click my orders and click on the listing I ordered, it says item no longer listed.<br /><br />I tried to exchange $125 mp to bitcoins with him and when I went to check my MP it told me the balance is $0...<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENED??&nbsp; :( :( :(

I would suggest finding a different way to buy Bitcoin in the future, or else use a reputable Bitcoin seller on Silk Road such as SugarMama, RxKing, Chronic Crew, or Blue Sky Traders (as mentioned by CaptainMal).<br /><br />- grahamgreene
