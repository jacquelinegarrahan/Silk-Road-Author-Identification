				Can a vendor have, say, a hundred of something but make it possible for any individual buyer to only buy a maximum of, say, four of that item? Maybe because it&#039;s a special price or something and the vendor doesn&#039;t want the first buyer to snap up the whole lot?

				Either on here or Atlantis I have &quot;unlimited&quot; checked on all my listings and although I think I&#039;m good for the most part, I am going to have some explaining to do if anyone ever orders 5,000kg.

				Let&#039;s say I&#039;m a new vendor and I want to offer a new vendor special to build feedback. So I offer 20 units at a special low price, hoping that 20 people will each buy one and leave feedback. But it might actually happen that one person buys all 20 and then I&#039;ve sold my stuff really cheap and only end up getting one feedback. Any way to avoid this? Would I have to just set the quantity to one and relist each time it sold until all 20 were gone?

				All the vendor has to do is make a new listing with the special price and set the number of these to say 10 or 20 and tell people to order only 1 each.If they order more then they get their order cancelled&nbsp; :P

				ok it&#039;s time that me, a vendor, chimed in here:<br /><br />&quot;Can a vendor have, say, a hundred of something but make it possible for any individual buyer to only buy a maximum of, say, four of that item&quot;<br /><br />The answer is, absolutely NO! There are no per buyer limits as there is no way for me, as a vendor, to limit the number of items an individual buyer can purchase automatically. I can always cancel your order after the fact but when I make a listing, the only thing I can put, in reference to the quantity of the item, is the total quantity I have of the item.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Is there anyway on the road to see how many lots a vendor has left for sale without having to contact &amp; bother them? &quot;<br /><br />YES! If I list item X, I enter say, 50 in the quantity field. Then when someone makes a purchase, the quantity available goes down by the number of items he bought, and this is automatic. If the buyer purchases a quantity of three, the quantity available goes down by three and the total number available changes automatically to 47. So, if you want to see how many are now available, just put a quantity of one in your shopping cart. Now look at your shopping cart. The maximum quantity you are able to buy is the number left for sale. It&#039;s as simple as that.<br /><br />By the way, buyers, don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re &quot;bothering&quot; me when you contact me to ask questions. Too often, buyers walk on eggshells with me when they message me with questions, scared that I&#039;ll get mad for them bothering me. I guess many vendors are like this? Not me, I&#039;m thankful for my customers, feel free to message me with any kind of question or concern.<br /><br />Hope the above info helped!<br /><br />QM

				It&#039;s best to message the vendor first asking them how much stock they have. Often they have more than what is listed up or less.<br /><br />I place a lot of large orders and several times i&#039;ve ordered the vendors entire stock only to be told they don&#039;t have enough left. If the order is hedged and they refund you after this happens you lose the 6% hedging fee so if you don&#039;t want to waste your money you should talk to them first.

				AussieMitch - this happens more often than it should on SR, and I apologize on behalf of all vendors. When I list an item, I don&#039;t put more quantity than I actually have. Some vendors think that they can put 500 of an item when they only have 50? That&#039;s bullshit, we&#039;re not supposed to list items we don&#039;t actually have on hand and ready to ship, SR is not a forum to advertise my items by listing way more quantity than I have so my listing is always up for buyers to see!<br /><br />This sucks, especially if you&#039;re losing money because you hedged the order. This isn&#039;t fair to buyers because it ties up your money in an item that is not available and then maybe you miss out on buying another item from another vendor because that item sold out while your coins were sitting in escrow on an item that isn&#039;t even available. I would contact SR admins if this happens to complain and perhaps get your 6% hedge fee back. You have every right to complain.<br /><br />QM<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195297.msg1425520#msg1425520">Quote from: AussieMitch on August 08, 2013, 04:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s best to message the vendor first asking them how much stock they have.
