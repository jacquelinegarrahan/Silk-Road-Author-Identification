				So I get on SR forums after being off less then a month. The first 3 posts are &quot;drug agents come to my house&quot; <br />&quot;Add 30%-50% weight to your bud&quot;<br />And &quot;how to become a vendor without paying&quot;. Wow! Sorry to the guy with the agents....you were a puss for admiting where you got your drugs though. Secondly someone should fuck up anyone trying to add weight to bud...i didn&#039;t even wanna open that thread and third....to become a vendor...pay your fucking dues you scamming pricks! Since Mtgox doesnt work as easily for cash deposits I&#039;ve kinda laid off the SR. Where are the vets like uniwiz and stormtrooper at? How to hell is everyone getting bitcoins in the US? Although thats a question within itself. I see alor of people talking shit about DPR which truly disgusts me. Create your own fucking drug site then!&nbsp; All in all this is a rant. To anyone who knows....are things running as smooth as say a year ago?&nbsp; FML :)<br />Cheers to all and Happy Holidays............Budtender01

				Aww damn, I guess I&#039;ll be the one to tell him.<br /><br />The forums are FULL of LE since the SR server raid last week. SR is supposedly back to normal, but a lot of people have been getting bopped. Plus, a shit ton of forum accounts were compromised, so half the posters you see are just LE now.<br /><br />Be careful please.<br /><br />*This message brought to you by the FBI*<br /><br />Edit: joking

				Hey Moon, thanks for your reply. Ill take it that you are serious being a hero member. I just don&#039;t see alot of the vets around. I&#039;ll be careful. Haven&#039;t really been looking forward to using the new deposit method through walmart/cvs, etc. <br />Thanks for the heads up!

				Well damn, that didn&#039;t go as expected. Guess I kind of pushed it this time. :-X<br /><br />I was only kidding around. No servers have been raided as far as I know, and the forums are running as they usually would.<br /><br />Still, be careful. ;)

				Nobody is quite sure what is going on.<br /><br />Mods have been removed without warning, SR has had a lot more down time recently, and it was recently the victim of a SQL hack, (just to name a few recent things)&nbsp; not to mention almost every thread nowadays being started by someone with less than 10 posts. This place is going down the shitter.

				What did actually happen to all of the old really good vendors? I would be interested to know which vendors have been busted and when. Just so I can keep a tally and bail out of selling here if it looks like things are actually compromised. After all it is our freedom at stake. nothing wrong with being over cautious. <br /><br />ACE

				I dont think any vendor has really been verified as actually being busted on SR. There was that one guy from Australia that got busted, but that wasnt even because he was selling on SR. He was just a dumbass.<br /><br />And most of the other people who say they have gotten buster were fairly new small vendors that were most likely scammers. None of the big vendors on here have actually been verified as being busted. And the bigger vendors are the ones LE would be going after you would think.<br /><br />I try to keep my eye on this sort of thing being a vendor myself. Need to be prepared when shit starts going down and big vendors are getting busted.
