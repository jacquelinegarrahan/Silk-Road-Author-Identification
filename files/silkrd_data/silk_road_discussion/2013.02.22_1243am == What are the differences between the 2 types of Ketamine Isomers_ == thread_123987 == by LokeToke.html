				Ok so I&#039;m becoming aware there&#039;s 2 types of Ketamine, like Ketamine S-Isomer and another one which I forget the name of, maybe someone else knows the name of the other.<br /><br />Anyway can users who know or have experience with please explain to me and others on here what the differences are between the 2 types? Are the highs different and if so can you explain how each types high is different? Also is the appearance different?<br /><br />Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer any insight, it&#039;s very much appreciated!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />-LokeToke

				S-isomer is more trippy and halucinogenic, the other isomer is more of a body high like a drunk/roll.&nbsp; You don&#039;t find the other isomer by itself but in the racemic(50/50) variety they&#039;re more balanced.&nbsp; I prefer the racemic.&nbsp; It seems &#039;stronger&#039; to me, though that&#039;s not the right word to attribute to it.

				I prefer the s-isomer type over all the K I&#039;ve done over the years.&nbsp; The shit set&#039;s me off floating into another world while I&#039;m on it-kinda seems like I&#039;m falling with very bright orange and red visuals (It&#039;s the best way I can explain it, when I&#039;m on it it seems like I can describe it perfectly in my mind but afterwards I&#039;m just like &#039;THE FUCK&#039;?)<br /><br />Anyways, s-isomer is where it&#039;s at.&nbsp; &nbsp;Got a gram on the way and I cannot wait for it to get here.

				<br />Visit SR page of MarcelKetman. They have a good description of the two on main page, and usually sells them both as well. Read it over then make a purchase. If you want K, cant ever go wrong with MK!

				Never had pure R isomer although a friend has. He said it is very hard to k-hole on and has a more dreamy/out of it but not dissociated feeling to it, psychedelic but less body effects and less dissociating (he said he could still k hole, but needed huge doses to do so). S isomer kicked my ass when I had it pure , was quite a few years ago though back when I first started ketamine. It is a lot easier to hole on and very dissociative as compared to racemic. Other than about five grams of S I had several years ago I have only had racemic though, which is what I prefer.
