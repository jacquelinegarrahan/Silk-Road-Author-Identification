				oh and for the record....<br /><br /><br />Limetless knows me well&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />i donated to him some bitcoins for his community contribution last month with an appreciation message and all. bother him if it makes you feel better knowing good people such as I exist, ya troll. <br /><br />but yes, regardless. i got trolled, hard. but a scammer? no, not even close. <br /><br /><br />im also sorry you lost 11 btc though, thats harsh. but that shit you pulled on me was a waste of an hour of my life. i chuckled today reading this, but none the less...inform us on the guy who actually scammed you. dont soil my fucking name because you thought I would pull some shitty move like that. <br /><br />all the best<br />

				Not much in the way of proof going on in this thread. No evidence of scamming by stickafinger and bitcoin love may have been scammed for some coins but why didnt he tell us the name of the actual scammer instead of getting hung up on stickafinger??

				yeah UKMJ,<br /><br />well bitcoin love did tell me (cause i asked, cause im not an asshole) about who actually DID scam him<br /><br />he said the user name is: zanny<br /><br />sounds familiar and i think this was a person who sold VERY cheap xanax at one point, or i guess just a similar name to the one im thinking. <br /><br />but i deleted most of our convo as it was just RAPID fire back and forth...but here is the LOVELY remaining amount of convo i have of him talking to me, as I kept saying i havent received anything yet as he kept calling me a fucking scammer:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=26058">Quote from: bitcoin love on July 08, 2012, 01:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ok they are sent...<br /><br />now let me guess you dont have a MP code?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=26058">Quote from: bitcoin love on July 08, 2012, 01:16 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">scammer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=26058">Quote from: bitcoin love on July 08, 2012, 01:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">SCAMMER!

				Stickafinger - which SR username did you just create? Beastman2012? So you are saying you created a new SR account for 1 transaction or do you mean a new SR forum name?
