				I&#039;m a regular MDMA user and have rather high tolerance. I have injected half of the skull pill&nbsp; and had a strong hallucinogen trip. Then tried some more (about 1/8 pill) 8 hours later and had feelings of strong tremor and overall discomfort for 30 minutes instead of normal extasy/MDA rush. There was a nice and strong feeling of empathy 40 minutes after the injection when the psycho trip ends. Just like when you inject 2c-c IV but lasts longer. Perhaps it is just not active as a psychedelic orally. <br /><br />This is NOT even MDA (which can be hallucinogenic in high doses too), more close to 2c-* or even some exotic triptamine.<br /><br />Maybe it contains some MDMA to pass the reagent test successfully but it is definitely not what I call &quot;Anything but pure MDMA&quot;. You don&#039;t need any testkits to make sure I&#039;m right. Inject any dose of &#039;MDMA&#039; from the skull pill and feel what I felt. (Dangerous, bad trip guaranteed). It&#039;s my first time when I give 1/5 to the seller and hope it to be the last.<br /><br />And yeah, I know how dangerous and irresponsible it is to IV pills. I injected mdma crystals and pills many times. There were different effects, many times I was scammed but usually it was at least amphetamine with MDA not this weird thing.<br />P.S. Delivery took about a month though average time of delivery to my place is 10-14 days

				IV pure salts, never a street pressed pill for your own sake.<br /><br />I love how you said you IV&#039;ed half the pill and it made you trip out, so then you IV 1/8 of the same pill.&nbsp; Really?<br />Also how do you know it&#039;s not a MDxx compound?&nbsp; You don&#039;t without a test-kit or a spectrometer.
