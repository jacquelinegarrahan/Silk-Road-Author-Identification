				So, I&#039;ve been doing web development for a little over 10 years now, and I was also an SR member for about a year and a half.&nbsp; I was as saddened as anyone when SR was shut down, but at the same time not surprised I knew sooner or later it would happen.&nbsp; Now that it&#039;s happened we all need to look ahead to the future.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m not entirely sure what that future is going to look like, but 1 thing is for sure I know there will be a future.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to help shape that future if at all possible.<br /><br />I see the future being a collection of multiple sites some large, some small, and some real small.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to help establish some of these real small sites.&nbsp; Any vendor who is at all interested in having their own .onion site I&#039;d like to work for you.&nbsp; A personal site where you can have full control over your customer base.&nbsp; It would basically be your own personal SR with you being the only vendor.&nbsp; Of course we would discuss details in full.&nbsp; You would be my client and I would be your developer.<br /><br />Now I know everyone is on their guard at the moment and rightfully so, me included.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a vendor and you&#039;re at all interested I can be reached at: norton65@safe-mail.net.&nbsp; I will ONLY ONLY ONLY talk over PGP so if you&#039;re not able to do this move on now.&nbsp; Once communication has been established we&#039;ll take the necessary time to get comfortable with each other.&nbsp; I like to think the entire process should take somewhere between 6 to 8 weeks to have a site fully running.<br /><br />Feel free to shoot me an email if you&#039;re interested or have any questions.&nbsp; Please understand if my responses are delayed.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />mQENBFJPMAkBCAC7UQrNDgU5Zolxx6PgELmlqOgIKFFKAMjWzcm5YsKgJxHRzbRt<br />3hSTysJYde2nyj73YuEb8uYDuBgwnq6zkvR9Udax4VbH0XmeDePEe19ckkkqAHbY<br />Nyym0fZB/Q8HdrHfAp902S3JutTh862wohPAu/g7C4fWBoTAbZF02e1oTlQEkYmP<br />Izt7/0r+NNPm0oXcg2gj7ov2RS5fytggeqkVudoo+RAy/UVJKEiDUgIDTAo3/ISh<br />qUp55iv3IuSctFKlNtTWw9je5GskdtTwpIZeNxt6P5p5f8HAhE8SgyedWOx74agn<br />AgpJme0ZC3szVN7TwiF558Ao0siuYDyvBNtNABEBAAG0HUJpcmQgRmVlZGVyIDxi<br />aXJkQGZlZWRlci5jb20+iQE3BBMBCgAhBQJSTzAJAhsDBQsJCAcDBRUKCQgLBRYC<br />AwEAAh4BAheAAAoJEHH78xAGpzl4miUH/jWjcLInSHdKmljTEjM4WnJ0HhsPiBQC<br />gRJ/nYI6WxvCb0U4Nsv/HS68/FBowm9ApBvQF89FkH9PH+JxomMFcc2cZ4avOt4o<br />HiG9z9qZu8CQizxUHeaEK2qyROSF5pDVLdi5yhyhR5xgKd87jnfUWNzCtr1wsac8<br />D+QXP7s15/Xp9ZEauMwDEKO02Ppv9R5i5ySsJGdd7DrSPoQdzcw1RBUG+YHakRlh<br />IkvSpdoneOUcGnwVoMSDFgabk8UhnDSESq8BRyrzt2Ke/JbJeU20v+NcHFw8Uds2<br />vpndKsvyBaQJj3foZ47nGK5mmfu/B8bYbNibi3X2gntwESl1CWDjXdW5AQ0EUk8w<br />CQEIALtWz0OW7cRBKMA+n5/5lcBtmOGe50wNPOT2w+InG46EIB7A2BB56bQkMf9d<br />po5yO8y2Sc6A5gXkzQC/WwQYGY7BTWVQoYkhRVGjTE9xnzMiHt60SlgQxV1nHKa6<br />VCgUIrjc5PmO1cDCsU8+3attcFSOtwQ2JQBkZ/nIvG1T9eaaPgWAMyi8imDFMJF1<br />GcXaiMZbQX094O9T7NWBq3HztenhdRbdiE6lrmtmOk5pTH+wnZxBZBlUmrFifWnT<br />YVxlhNPeVoI6Y7+oCxaBUCqkTtxMxh9UnAPGSIH1u76jEJgQ7bITkGnAf/Jtj5FT<br />MyCSiv+rGJIfwSS9JnsLhhzO/HEAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQoACQUCUk8wCQIbDAAKCRBx<br />+/MQBqc5eIuYCACyPiIyjPULAUm6YKIpx44SuWpXfZJ0Ic5iQw+EEiIlj3BiUCsB<br />1coyoL1IcX08jVZkjH1/XhmcIJ/ZvxRqtInnigLtTYGgnm2Zu49e5sE0YxQJyVua<br />xa4TlOuefOE3As22JAE1xAUGpD6M8gQXi0GO8F9gos1sZNy8WwsyYouj7Pt9aibK<br />1rkvf2fy8QnwzurhW4Omzckgi/jnijMElJ5sU7uxuw7QB+IaOHhPqAjoLfOv17KE<br />F4jRzX/PT01h4LMur7SSmPC4tx5R6Ykz7GC1KVeUO/3Ab4dF2Wbq+Uw4LDs2xaL8<br />s5W1qYWEPKV3W8VI9He+w0qrzmEB/+qO5zTx<br />=rCe1<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />

				I don&#039;t think the future is having individual vendors run their own .onion sites. This leaves out the most important features of the marketplace we all want: escrow and reputation. If we can instead collaborate on an open-source, federated marketplace based on strong crypto reputation, then I think that would be a better way for us all to make the future come sooner.

				Dude, people would LOVE if the top vendors just had there own sites. People would use them for sure man and I would totally be interested but how do I know buddy he aint a fed? He&#039;s probably going to need some type of personal info from you or how do you know hes not just gonna make sure he always has access to the wallet and one days just robs you? It&#039;s really hard to find trusting people on the internet to work with....

				I think an open source bitcoin transaction marketplace could actually be developed on the clear net.&nbsp; There is nothing illegal about the technology or developing a marketplace.&nbsp; Using a marketplace to sell contraband is illegal.<br /><br />Crime and web development require different skills.&nbsp; For this reason it makes sense to split the operators from the developers.&nbsp; If done right, this will shield the developers.<br /><br />Black hat developers are out there, but it is going to be hard to find people who are good developers and good criminals.
