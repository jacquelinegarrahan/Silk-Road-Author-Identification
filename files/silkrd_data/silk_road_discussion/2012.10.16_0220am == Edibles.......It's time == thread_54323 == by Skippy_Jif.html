				I have been a buyer on SR for awhile now and lately a successful vendor. I have had success because I know what people look for. This is not to be superior than thou, but to guide people away from crap!<br /><br />I have bought many edibles and not 1 has given me a proper medicated feeling/high/buzz what the fuck ever! Until now.<br /><br />The vendor that sold me an edible that was actually worth a damn and the price was Senses! I have tried multiple US vendors and have had very undesirable effects. I don&#039;t regularly smoke. Only on rare occasions. I know that weed feels like with any administration, so don&#039;t try that shit.<br /><br />There are multiple vendors either scamming or putting in the bare minimum. IDK, but I know what vlue for your $ is and the edible market is fucked in the US!<br /><br />Please, share your frustrations if any. We don&#039;t need high fives for vendors because that isn&#039;t the case now.

				I am an ex Cannabis caregiver in a Medical State. My edibles were $3 and knocked patients out for hours. A properly made edible is extremely strong. I feel bad for people that still make butter &gt;.&gt; such inefficient crap. I have probably 1500 doses of powerful edibles in coconut oil that I&#039;ve thought about making an account for countless times but doesn&#039;t feel worthwhile. I&#039;d rather have a supply to spread the love over the next year like I&#039;ve been doing. <br /><br />tl;dr If the edibles suck, they have no idea what they are doing.

Whatever you do, do not put it in your carry-on (although when i went back to Denver after my vacation in Maryland, I had a pill bottle i use for weed that had a large ass stem in my backpack) i was panicking b/c i forgot to fucking take it out before I got to the airport, but luckily it got through without any problems.<br /><br />Never the less, I recommend putting any edibles in your checked baggage, just to be on the safe side. This limits the amount of interaction between your bag, your drugs, and TSA. What I do for mine is I have a zipper pocket inside my luggage i put all my socks in, I put two socks together and fold them to make pairs, in one of the socks I tuck the edible into the toe of the sock. The pocket allows me to clump all the socks close together, so it&#039;s ideal in that inspection officers don&#039;t feel weird buldges in my socks, and I know they don&#039;t have time to be checking all my socks for illegal stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;ve successfully done this with cheeba chews and have never gotten them confiscated. I&#039;ve also done this with like a dime sack nd dub sack of weed.

				I can make edibles without any smell. The smell comes from terpenes in the plant which do not have to be included in the plant. If I want to make stealth edibles I do a wash similar to water curing. I use this process with good bubbles hash/dry ice hash. You soak it in cold water and mix well. Let sit for 12 hours while terpenes and other residue plant matter get absorbed by the water. Strain and let hash dry. Use coconut oil to infuse the cannabinoids into the saturated fat. Because coconut oil is so high in saturated fat you can have a much higher concentration than other oils especially worthless butter. When you get the correct concentration into your coconut oil that requires a small amount of oil you make something as normal using a small amount of coconut oil and the rest of another oil such as olive oil. A dog is very unlikely to smell it and if detected the trainer and other humans wouldn&#039;t be able to smell it, pass it off as a hungry dog.

				I&#039;ve been trying to order Cheeba Chews, current dicking around with an edibles vendor here who took my money for them and did not deliver after FE.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s bad to FE but they were the only source I saw for them.

				Skippy, and the rest. You guys can give me a try :) I think my pricepoint for the potency is pretty alright. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/29438ed66d<br /><br />For the record I don&#039;t go through the same process that MasterS said, but they are fairly potent! I will look into that tek and try and incorporate it into my next batch.

				If you vacuum seal I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t need it. For me and others to have on their person. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s cost effective time wise when you can just triple vacuum seal. Then again it does remove that cannabis taste some people don&#039;t like so there is that, but most people actually like the taste.

				i live in california and you can get extremely potent edibles called hubby bars for 8 bucks. they contain hash oil (and smell potent) and all one needs to get baked is a small piece of one. they also come in a variety of flavors. i was actually thinking about selling edibles and hash but i can&#039;t afford the payment to start a seller account.

Start-up costs are more than just the vendor fee, you also have packaging and mailing equipment, plus enough to buy all of your product the first time. Remember, you cant have people FE as a new seller, so you will have to wait until the customer actually receives the packages and&nbsp; finalizes, or wait the 17 days for the auto-finalization.<br /><br />As to edibles, I&#039;ve always been rather cautious about buying edibles from anyone, let alone on SR. No way, outside of lab testing, to be sure how much THC/weed actually went into the product. Most edibles ive made tend to vary subjectively from person to person, even from the same batch, so again always the question as to exactly how much THC is in the edible. Also, I tend to be concerned about cleanliness while cooking, especially when I will be consuming the end product. No way to know in what conditions the edibles were made, only the sellers word. I&#039;m sure there are honest vendors out there with clean setups, accurate weight, and fresh products, but its always possible for a vendor to get lazy/cheap and start cutting corners. Never bought hash here either for the same reasons.

				If you feel this strongly about vendors&#039; edibles then start an Edible Review thread a la Uniwiz&#039;s review thread that&#039;s packed full of real community information, not just one vendor saying another is good.&nbsp; For all any of us know it&#039;s the same vendor pushing their other account.&nbsp; Make your own decisions after shopping around people, it&#039;s that easy.<br /><br />And in my case I&#039;m already -2 to the community for handing out a bunk batch of one of my favorites.&nbsp; I only say bunk batch because I had a couple people PM about their quality and they both received items out of the same batch.&nbsp; Even in a factory they can fuck up a good thing, sad but true.&nbsp; All is made well with those two of course but it not only shakes how other people perceive my product but makes me wonder if I should ever offer it again due to QC issues.<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit buzzed and feeling feisty so take it for what it&#039;s worth.&nbsp; I also hate the shit marketing ploys and misinformation I see everyday, on and off the road.&nbsp; Let the products stand on their own and let the community decide what&#039;s better with their coin.<br /><br />And while I&#039;m at it, here&#039;s food for thought.&nbsp; I have tried multiple vendors&#039; edibles before and after becoming a vendor and they were all shit compared to mine.&nbsp; Similar statement as the first post with just as much information to back it up.
