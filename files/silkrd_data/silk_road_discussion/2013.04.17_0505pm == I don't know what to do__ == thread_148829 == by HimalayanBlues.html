				Hello Community,<br /><br />I am confused, angry, sad and really don&#039;t know what to do. I bought a Vendor account a few months ago from what I have saved. I thought I would contribute to the community by bringing good quality stuff and sending to those in need. I sent samples, however don&#039;t really know how many made to their destination and two packages of good quality Indian Hashish. My two packages didn&#039;t arrived at the destination, however I offered refunds and still was given a bad bad feedback. Now I am thinking of any way to sell my Vendor account to any one on the road interested, or may be any Vendor would like to work with me paying me on commission basis or any alternative. I still have some stock of good Cannabis eatables which is a new kind of product on the road which no one has yet offered and is really worth trying. <br /><br />I need suggestions, advices, opinions and everything to make not heaps of money but some money to support my vendor profile and bring out some other amazing products available in my region.<br /><br />Thanks and Regards,<br />HB

				What is your region exactly? And did any of them say received when you checked your tracking ? And nobody should have given you bad feedback if you offered to refund them. Seems a little weird imo

				Hey, sorry to hear this :( <br />I think you should give it another go. If both parcels did not make it, its not encouraging for other buyers. Even though you gave them a 50% refund people want to know they have a 99% chance of getting it. If you can get a few samples though, and its high quality word should spread on the forums ;) <br />

				Once you complete a number of transactions you&#039;ll get your vendor deposit back too.<br />So at least stick with it until you can get that back, you may find you like it better with the changes you&#039;re investing in.<br />:)<br /><br />Good luck!
