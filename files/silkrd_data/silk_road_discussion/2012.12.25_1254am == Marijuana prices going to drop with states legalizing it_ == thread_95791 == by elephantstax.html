				Hi forum members.<br /><br />I was wondering with these 2 states legalizing weed in US, if the prices will reflect on SR. Maybe we will be seeing a significant supply increase..<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I&#039;ve been thinking about this too, I&#039;m sure other states will soon follow. It would be awesome if prices did start dropping.

				I read something written by an economics professor that says within a few years weed in Colorado could go down to 40 an oz or less.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to find the paper.

				In what states is marijuana currently either legal or decriminalized?&nbsp; I think it is Washington, Colorado, Alaska, Oregon, California, Massachusetts, Maine, Ohio, Nevada, New York, Nebraska, Mississippi, and North Carolina.&nbsp; Is this a current list or have any been added lately?

				Anyone who gets cheap-pot-prices like that in one of the legalized states is just going to sell it for a massive mark-up on the Road. You can bet that you won&#039;t see prices under $200 an ounce unless a giant bidding-war opens up and everyone aims to get the most customers by having the lowest prices... But people are smart and they know price-fixing is better for profits.

				First off, no, prices are not going much lower.&nbsp; $40 an ounce, not for premium.&nbsp; Never again.&nbsp; It would not be worth growing and then you would have Mexican cartels dominating in market once again.&nbsp; Reason; they could do it at $40 a Z and still make money using basically slave labor of the impoverished.&nbsp; Most of us in the US would NOT even bother producing it if the rewards were that low.&nbsp; Nearly all states where it is legal or decriminalized, dictate either the quantity, quality, and or the pricing of this product.&nbsp; I have not seen a situation where street prices were lowered due to pot being served in the public domain.&nbsp; Not once.

A family member in her 70&#039;s loved to get fucked up and had the best feel good DR iv ever seen! we got<br /><br />300 100mg demerol<br />3 boxes of 100mg fenty patches<br />60 xanax<br />60 kpins<br />90 Oc&#039;s 80&#039;s<br />And at some point during her time before i started getting meds from her she had in the back of her cabnets a fucking bottle of liquid methadone!! I could not believe what i was seeing, i made over 3grand on methadone shots alone..This went on from 2002 til 2008 when unfortunately she passed.. Man those were good days!! An dsuper fuuuked up!

				As with all things it&#039;s a supply and demand issue.&nbsp; Granted the supply has gone up pretty good the last decade or so, so has the demand.&nbsp; With marijuana starting to be legalized the demand will skyrocket.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure there are enough growers to supply the increased user base that comes from making it legal.&nbsp; Anyone can grow really, but it&#039;s finding that special grower that matters.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a lot of shit weed even in professional shops; like I said anyone can grow...but not everyone can be a Dr Green Thumb.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see what happens next year.&nbsp; IF the feds allow giant commercial grows to get by for recreational purposes I would think the supply will eventually get to where it needs to be to drop prices.&nbsp; I have a feeling they&#039;ve bottomed out for the short term though.<br /><br />Gotta love speculation :)

				in states with thriving medical and decrim market there is a large separation between quality buds and average.&nbsp; in nor cal you are going to be selling lbs for $1000 that easily go for $2800 on the east coast.<br />i think the prices for this A quality and less are going to continue to drop and eventually reach $200zips nation wide.&nbsp; but the REAL medical quality AAA+ strains are going to stay priced higher.&nbsp; most people<br />can&#039;t grow, and dispensaries and regular users should know this.&nbsp; the people who grow real quality demand a certain price for their work, and when the consumer is bored of smoking some grass that won&#039;t even get them buzzed they&#039;ll come a&#039;runnin for that potent.

				Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine,&nbsp; Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have medical marijuana.

That shouldn&#039;t be discounted; the two laws in those states have pretty much opened the door between patients and doctors for discussing medical marijuana. Even the most paranoid person can admit to their doctor that they smoke pot for... some medical reason, and since it is now legal in the two states, maybe the doctors will be more willing to give a recommendation... it&#039;s not &quot;BAD&quot; anymore, after all. Maybe just &quot;...bad...&quot; now? Or better yet, &quot;.......good?......&quot;? :D
