				Hi, from a technical perspective the anonymity of SR is to be respected. The obvious avenue for LE to take is to hijack the domain.&nbsp; What measures can we take to check the signing of a web page as from official SR servers?<br /><br />For example, if LE hijacked the domain, this is how the could gather maximum information very easily:<br />&nbsp;-Duplicate login page from current SR login page on their server<br />&nbsp;-Use set of pre-downloaded captcha images<br />&nbsp;-Authenticate all logins!<br />&nbsp;-After you login, display error message to trick members into thinking SR is down<br /><br />You have just been phished!<br /><br />

				For as long as SR has been around there have been fake SR sites set up to phish login details. Most hidden wiki sites have a few links to fake SR sites.<br /><br />The SR domain name is memorable enough that regular users should know they are on the correct site. <br /><br />By the way Vladimir there is already a vlad1m1r on SR wouldn&#039;t want anyone confusing you guys.

All LE would need to do is phish SR for a few hours, let people try to authenticate, and then stop hijacking the domain such that LE can log into SR with the newly collected logins.<br /><br />I do not think anything posted so far demonstrates how SR members would be aware that SR is being hijacked.<br /><br />

				why would we post the most important security things for SR, isnt that just giving LE an easy way in by showing our weakness&#039;. Why taunt LE by giving them plausible cheap ways to shut us down. just my 2 cents.<br /><br />mclovin478910

				You are acting like LE is not aware of this tactic, and that I must be some type of genius to think it up. It is a very common tactic and announcing it makes no difference. <br /><br />Is it better to realize technical problems or ignore them?<br /><br />Again, how can we be sure that the SR we are looking at right now is run by the adminis and not LE?<br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no such thing as 100% sure. That&#039;s why when I order something I encrypt my address with 2,048 bit encryption. I also have all sensitive information stored off my os. It kinda goes along the lines of not licking stamps, handling with gloves and destroying any envelope that I receive as soon as I get it. <br />&nbsp;But as for your specific question I don&#039;t have a in depth answer to that....

				Out of sheer paranoia for this exact reason--I typically enter an incorrect password that is close to my real password first.&nbsp; It get the red login failed message, and then I authenticate normally and log in.&nbsp; <br /><br />The problem is still there, if LE actually gets a hold of the authentication server and gains access to all of our passwords, but if they were just trying to phish for them by cloning the login pate, they wouldn&#039;t be able to tell whether a password is legitimate or not.&nbsp;

Then run a hashing program to find an address silkroadvb5piz3r wait 1 to 10 to 100 years and wham they would generate the private keys and be able to set up a silk road clone and divert some traffic to it. Not that hard but it would take a long time to generate the exact same address if ever. It would be possible for a super computer to do it in a few years, but that would be a huge wast of resources.
