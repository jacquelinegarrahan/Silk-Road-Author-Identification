				Now,&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that karma really doesn&#039;t mean a lot.&nbsp; &nbsp; But,&nbsp; that being said,&nbsp; &nbsp;when you see good karma it makes you feel like your a pretty cool dude.&nbsp; &nbsp;When you see bad karma, your like, man, I must be an ass.<br /><br />I myself have 3 negatives.&nbsp; &nbsp; And I can honestly say that I have done nothing to deserve it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />So to anyone that just gives someone bad karma here are some things to keep in mind.<br /><br />Yes, give bad karma if:<br />1.&nbsp; someone is being a asshole<br />2.&nbsp; someone personally attacks you in a thread<br /><br />No,&nbsp; do not give bad karma if:<br />1.&nbsp; someone posts something that doesn&#039;t go along with your beliefs.&nbsp; <br />2.&nbsp; you are just feeling like a super jerk that day<br /><br />If people just kept that in mind, super jerks would have super bad karma,&nbsp; &nbsp;and decent people will be buried under the good vibes that others send them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right?&nbsp; &nbsp;Right?

Thankyou<br /><br /><br />and for the record, I was posting random inoffensive gibberish to build my count as I did not think it was fair to have my forum access taken from me, some posts were then deleted which is why I decided to protest by being offensive as possible. if people were taking my advice to use cyanide because it had &#039;no comedown&#039; literally, well then I hope they followed through with it because humanity does not need that level of stupidity. <br /><br />Have a look at my other thread about the roundtable and see what you think.

				Same here. Received one explanation (&quot;for being a poor loser&quot; - fuck that) but none for the others. Whatever. I try to be helpful/serious when I can, but sometimes it&#039;s important for people to just lighten the fuck up. If that upsets someone, they&#039;re the ones with the issue, not me.

				I&#039;ve been browsing this thread but didn&#039;t want to contribute for obvious reasons to at least a couple people here. <br /><br />No one is getting -K deservedly/undeservedly it&#039;s just a thing that happens randomly every week thanks to some troll/s that think the system is unfair b/c when they first joined SR they got hit, and decided to retaliate when they reached 100. I said this before though.<br /><br />Speaking of -K, I just received 1 last night from mods I believe, for trying to stand ^ for them. Hmm. A think a couple of them here a little confused.<br /><br />Last night an obvious troll made the mods look stupid (actually, they did that themselves by taking it) and I merely stood ^ for them, and the thanks I received was that I was negged after my post, had it deleted by a mod (along with about 10 other innocent posts), but worse, the guy that made remarks that carry a legal penalty for posting it, remains ^. I realise that on a site like SR there are some things overlooked, but some are of these guys are just turning a blind eye to things that would see them stripped of their mod status elsewhere.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a hater, I&#039;m just trying to make a point that even when you do the right thing on SR you can STILL be negged (even by a mod you stood ^ for ???) and until it is investigated/fixed everyone is getting them for the wrong reaons so please don&#039;t take it persoanlly. You newbies have come at a bad time in terms of -K relegation.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess I sure as shit won&#039;t be standing ^ for any mod again, I feel sorry for guru and the others..... Just try to stay positive, I try to monitor this site and stick ^ for guys being given -K unnecessarily but I have been a bit distracted lately with some things IRL and have not had a chance to look into this as more than I have. I tried though, still am, just not a great time for me right now. Don&#039;t worry about it too much, just focus on the good guys here and remember the assholes, b/c there are a shit load of troll on this site this week that the mods have refused to deal with.<br /><br />If this post gets deleted and my acc./ banned or I&#039;m made invisible on the forums after this why the fuck would I be surprised, it seems the way they do things here is, to keep your acc./ you should troll, to lose it just try and support the mods or DPR (like guru).<br /><br />Something you should know though, is that I ALWAYS look out for people picked on at SR, and ALWAYS go out of my way to deal with trolls and people who give out -K for no reason. Try and stay positive, that&#039;s the only advice I can give (and whatever you do don&#039;t try to help out the mods or you&#039;ll get a fucking slap in the face.) Sorry but I just feel pissed right now and freaking out over something IRL and also wanted to let people know why this -K thing is happening.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.

				Karma keeps us all playing nice in the sandpit. <br /><br />We usually give neg karma for when roadsters are being an arsehole, or calling them on obvious bullshit.<br /><br />We try not to just because someone loves XYZ/hates XYZ and we don&#039;t agree with them.<br /><br />We have been a boorish motormouth on other forums in the past, and we regret having been a jerk, so we like that karma is the Sheriff on SR.<br /><br />Be well. m.

				I think you should have the option of writing a little something when you rep some one either good or bad then at least that way people know where their going wrong, most of the time I know why I have been bad repd but sometimes I write a perfectly decent post and boom bad rep like this one for example I will probably get a bad rep off some one.

Not everyone on the forum is going to agree with your opinions, and that is beneficial as it gives you an opportunity to look at others opinions and see if you can find sense in them, and if you can try and understand other people better so in future occasions you can deal with them in a different manner.

				OP:<br /><br />Yep, as you can see I have -3 k. I am a fair person, I&#039;m not here to flame or troll, and I keep my posts as respectful as possible. I can&#039;t remember which post it was exactly, but I guess someone &quot;didn&#039;t agree&quot; with what I said so I got -k.<br /><br />Then I replied again saying something along the lines of &quot;Seriously? Someone gave me -k for that? What the hell&quot;. And WHAT DO YOU KNOW? I got 2 more -k for that post. I just don&#039;t understand. <br /><br />I agree with the people saying you should have to state a reason why you gave karma, whether it&#039;s + OR -. I&#039;ve seen it on many other forums so if it could be implemented into this one, that would be great.

Epic. No one here think that mods censor things. Everyone, or most, is on board on this issue. I&#039;m glad that people can differentiate the difference between stand-over modding and responding to a threat caused by a parasite. No mod has ever censored someone that I can recall. In fact, if you look at the stuff here, with the allowed swearing and so forth, I think it&#039;s pretty damn generous what we can say here. If some mod censors someone, you can bet they stuffed up pretty badly (lol, the member not the mod ::) ). I mean, if you find SR forums too tough when it comes to censorship, shit, you must have problems buddy. There IS no censorship. We are given a huge leash. Some trolls are can just never fit in no matter where they go. Oh well. Piss off Roky. :D<br /><br />If someone thinks a mod has gone too far, or, I&#039;ll make it even easier..... has even censored in the first place, raise you hand......? seriously, who has even been censored? b/c it takes a fair bit.<br /><br />Piece out.

				Has anybody noticed this kid thinks the world revolves around him? Wow. Depressing. Um. Yeah. Ah...Roky? Wasn&#039;t actually referring to you, you fucking retard, lol. The only person on SR who knows what I&#039;m talking about is Chi and as he and I both don&#039;t say shit to shit then safe to say a retard like you will have no clue as to what that is....also... don;t you ever come up with something original instead of spamming other people&#039;s quotes? Oohh...... that&#039;s right.... you&#039;re a retard. ::) (No offense, I have nothing against the handicapped, we are all God&#039;s children)<br /><br />To redirect our ATT: slightly, blueberry34, lol, I already answered that q. 4 times now lol, it&#039;s back a little. Unless you&#039;re like NoNudesForYou or Roky, who don&#039;t seem to have any friends here, you don&#039;t need to worry b/c it does not necessarily reflect on the fact that you have done something wrong, just that there are people on this forum who are a little immature about it and give everyone neg for reasons I went into before. god, it&#039;s on this thread. I don&#039;t like it b/c new members take it personally and they need to be advised that they did nothing wrong, it&#039;s just a glitch in the .SYS. Like I&#039;ve said (though I&#039;ve [edit.] and rephrase it a fair bit....) to someone else, it is better to have more -K and heaps of friends on SR and SR forums than less -K and less friends. Be assured, if you spend any time here on SR we will discover a lot of retards, but also a lot of intelligent and supportive people so think of it that way when your -K rises..... every time it rises, you have already met someone worth dealing with else on SR....<br /><br />Hope that helps. :)

				Sometimes people just don&#039;t like you, or something you&#039;ve said. Therefore negative karma happens.<br /><br />It is meaningless (unless you&#039;re a vendor that relies on such reputation) and thinking about it for anything more than no time at all whatsoever, ever, is too much.
