The good ol&#039; crystal diet<br /><br />There&#039;s no secret to weight loss. It&#039;s so simple the problem is people don&#039;t want to do it. <br /><br />Portion control:<br />Ever wonder why the hell we eat three big meals a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner)? it&#039;s not like our ancestors were like &quot;Oh, it&#039;s 3pm time for lunch.&quot; The three meal system was actually created to make work efficiency better, crazy I know. The best diet researchers are now discovering is actually a six meals a day plan, but it&#039;s so hard to break from the man made three meal a day plan. Six small nutritious meals throughout the day will make you lose weight without even working out. <br /><br />Exercise:<br />This is a big one and I personally don&#039;t do enough so I&#039;m part of the problem. Like I said before our ancestors were always on the move, they were nomads and consistently walking, running, etc. Now we just sit down in front of a screen for hours and it&#039;s not good for us. You don&#039;t have to do the P90X workout or by a $1200 Bowflex just do some simple exercises. Pushups, situps, pullups, jumping jacks, jogging, etc. <br /><br />The reason why you lose weight on amphetamines is because it increases your metabolism and suppresses your appetite which is not healthy obviously. If motivation is the only thing holding you back try a pre-workout supplement, they mostly contain stimulants (though they&#039;re starting to ban them) like caffeine or DMAA that are similar to amphetamines but less harmful so they give you that rush that motivate you to workout.

				Phentermine products are a good way to help with weight loss.&nbsp; I plan on offering in the near future.&nbsp; They are safer than the crystal diet for sure, but of course like john doe said, eating right and exercise will work best, but whats the fun in that...

				I have four solid choices:&nbsp; phentermine, sibutramine, clenbuterol, and t3.&nbsp; I have used all four and advised many customers in the use of these drugs along with nutrition and lifestyle changes.&nbsp; Feel free to get in touch if you are interested.&nbsp; Be warned that if you don&#039;t read and understand my entire profile page your odds of getting your order canceled are near 100%.&nbsp; Better to chat with me first, and I will remind you to look over the profile for policies before you order.

				Flaxceed would be THE ONLY person I go to use weight lose drugs. You have to be tough mentally to reach your goals because there are some tough plateaus but he helps you 24 hours 7 days a week.. the things he knows, little tips and tricks and vitamins to add to the mix to make things work better and faster. No personal trainer can beat him. He knows the biology and the science amazingly well, better than any trainer or any book out there. I lost weight quickly, but could not even do ten minutes on the stairmaster, I felt like my joints had just finished a 20 mile run. He was amazing telling me to have a day where I&#039;m&nbsp; not concerned with my food intake, and then eat more the days I worked out less, as opposed to those I worked out harder, I took a&nbsp; break from the plan, because I had a friend visiting, and I just get home and see a message from him like let&#039;s get started! The presentation and the send out were top notch, I hadn&#039;t seen that much tape since I was 5 on my christmas present&#039;s, but it def got it to my house within days. he gave me some extra as well, but I can tell you it&#039;s not fully the pills that sold me (well at first of course,) but this guy gives you sooo much more than just the pills. He gives you workout tips, successful ways to eat, dialogue&nbsp; with you every day, ad my favorite, if you give him permission he&#039;ll get boot instructor on your ass and make sure you are getting the full benefit of the pills. He&#039;s a god dam guru and if I were to run out of pills. I would pay him instead even for a little of his wisdom in this area<br />
