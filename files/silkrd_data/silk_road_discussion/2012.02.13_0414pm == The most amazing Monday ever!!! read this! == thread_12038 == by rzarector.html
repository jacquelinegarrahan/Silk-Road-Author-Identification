				Hey everyone im rzarector and as im sure you can see i am new to SR but i want to tell you wonderful people about my most amazing monday morning ever.<br /><br />So I made my first buys on SR on wednesday last week did my research found the safe buyers and went for it. i ordered 3 packages from 3 different vendors and hoped id get one by monday. i patiently waited the rest of the week and weekend for them to arrive. sunday comes and im eager to get to sleep and wake up to a package...sadly my brain knew something was coming and was so excited for the arrival of my delicious package the next morning that i could not fall asleep as hard as i tried and ended up tossing and turning till 3 am. Tada! monday morning comes and i spring outta bed and jump in the car to go get some smokes. As im pulling out of my drive way the mail lady comes driving by and and stops me on the road (i live on a small backwoods country lane) and says hey rza i have not one not two but three packages for you! a smile lights up my face. As soon as i got home i cracked open those packages and found the most glorious weed and h ive ever seen im now sitting her with a mild nod and great high and thats why this was my best monday morning ever.<br /><br />a huge huge thanks to a certain aquatic mammal fan for being the best h vendor&nbsp; and being so helpful to me for my first buy he is an asset to SR<br />another huge thanks to tweet and viscious86 for being amazing bud vendors and also very helpful to a first time buyer.<br /><br />i am now in love with SR and i wont being going back to lame ass street nickras who dont know shit about bud. thanks to the community for everything without you i wouldnt have known who to buy from and i might have got scammed my first time i &lt;3 you all!!!
