				I wanted to hear from you lot, especially those who have been around for a while, how many purchases have you made on SR so far?<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering because, SR is pretty much my only source as of now to get, well... anything. And it could very well stay that way for a while.<br /><br />Part of me worries that if I am to buy from SR a lot, always being delivered to the same address, that eventually a letter/package will get seized and I&#039;ll be in trouble.<br /><br />So what about you guys? Anyone out there with hundreds of deliveries and not a single issue?

				I doubt you&#039;re going to find people on the forum who are going to give up that info...but I can tell you that out of a lot of packages I&#039;ve only had one love letter. Just make sure to do your research before you buy, that will drastically reduce your chances of having a problem.

If customs come calling, deny everything and don&#039;t tell them shit.
