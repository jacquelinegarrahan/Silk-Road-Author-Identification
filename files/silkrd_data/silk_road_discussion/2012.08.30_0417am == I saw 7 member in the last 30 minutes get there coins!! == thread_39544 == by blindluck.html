				This is actually kind of clever for a worthless dumbass such as yourself.&nbsp; Congrats man, I think you now have enough experience to LEVEL UP.&nbsp; You now have 3 new skills particular to the level 2 worthless dumbasses.&nbsp; <br /><br />1.&nbsp; Pretending you lost money in the hopes that someone will walk up with the money lost by someone else and offer it to you.&nbsp; Use this new skill to walk into police stations asking if they found your lost wallet.<br />2.&nbsp; Making a scamming vending account.&nbsp; This is only for rich level 2 worthless dumbasses.&nbsp; Maybe some day if you beg for enough coin this could be you!<br />3 .&nbsp; Sucking dick for money.&nbsp; Yes that&#039;s right, it&#039;ll help you fund a scamming vendors account.

				Correct me if I&#039;m wrong blindluck, but aren&#039;t you the guy from the other thread who said he&#039;s been up for 2 days waiting for your coins, If so, why in the fuck are you depriving yourself of sleep for 2 days just for ~Â£50, staying awake isn&#039;t going to make the coins come any faster, just sleep, wake up and check again.

				Stop FREAKING out over 8.75 btc and get some sleep.&nbsp; &nbsp;DPR is aware of the problem from the posts he has made and I bet if you stop whining and posting non stop something good will happen for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes you have to give it time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I could understand if this was big bucks $$$ but for under a hundred US $....you just need to show some patience instead of doing what you are doing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Assholes generally are put at the back of the line in my experience....just saying.
