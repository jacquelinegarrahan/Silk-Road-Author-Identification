				Look, I&#039;ve seen people post different scripts to &quot;speed up&quot; SR, onion.to, etc. I dont trust it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also seen different opnion.to SR servers to use, could somebody tell me wtf they are? <br /><br />I cant take parts of the days when I can contact my trusted vedndors esp when I&#039;m about to deposit $400 a week before I have to start work...<br /><br />Important. PM me with any info or post for all to see...<br /><br />roth

				All I know is that onion.to connections are unsafe, it&#039;s a way of accessing deep net sites via clear net browsers<br />Even if you use TOR and access sites with the onion.to domain extension it&#039;s still unsafe as the could be monitoring your communication.<br />At least thats my understanding of it.<br /><br />I also want to know the answer to your question, I keep getting time outs or just way to slow connections.

				Hey wwwrothy, I wouldnt trust the &#039;Re: Reduce time-outs for any .onion service (on Windows)&#039; post. At least until someone can clarify its legit and worth using. The main silk road site has been off lately, NorCalKing had a good idea I started using and thats to open multiple tabs at once and keep an eye on that browser status at the bottom left/right of the tabs to see which one says &#039;connected&#039; not connecting, if it says connecting it hasn&#039;t connected yet! Eventually you&#039;ll see transferring and thats when everything starts showin up. Try disconnecting/reconnecting to tor a few times too.<br /><br />On another note, the server or servers&nbsp; or maybe its the network its on, that run the FORUMS, are way better then those that handle Silkroadvb5 operations. I don&#039;t know if any of the people running it realize this or not, but forums are way faster tenfold. Might wanna do some looking, but hey what do I know I still haven&#039;t passed my CCNA, only one try tho *-* missed it by 25

				For the love of god guys, it&#039;s a simple setting to change in you&#039;re fucking browser prefs. just type about:config and modify this variable:<br /><br />network.http.keep-alive.timeout;20

				Its just the nature of Tor, even these forums time out alot. Best thing to do sometimes is reset tor and it will find a circuit, otherwise it will keep trying to use the same nodes and if one of them is some dickhead relay with 50Kb/s throughput then it will cause everything to timeout.

The keep-alive setting in about:config works, I&#039;ve loaded on way fewer refreshes sinced i changed it
