So I reinstalled TOR, nothing changes.<br /><br />:(((

				The reason you see prices listed in dollars when you view certain transactions is because those transactions are hedged. All this means is that when the order is finalized (or you receive a refund or the order gets canceled), the amount of bitcoins transferred will be equivalent to that USD value, regardless of how the exchange rate has fluctuated between the time the order was placed and the finalization. A vendor can choose to hedge their listings, or leave them unhedged, in which case the price will be displayed in BTC and the vendor will receive payment based on the exchange rate at the time of purchase. Everything in your screenshots is working as intended and there&#039;s nothing you can do to alter any of that. You can, however, choose whether you want the prices for active listings, and your available balance, to be displayed in BTC or USD, though it seems you aren&#039;t having a problem in that area.

				Yes, something is wrong with SR, it STILL isn&#039;t bigger than McD&#039;s :)<br /><br />And... if it ever was as big as McDs I bet my entire BTC and all my stash now and forever, that it would do less damage to the people of the planet, not to mention the planet itself.
