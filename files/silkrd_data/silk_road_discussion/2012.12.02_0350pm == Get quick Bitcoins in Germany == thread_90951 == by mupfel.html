				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m from germany and a member for 3 months now.. however, i am looking for a way to get quick Bitcoins, i looked completely through the &quot;Money&quot; category on the road and found nothing useable.<br />Now.. are there maybe any other germans or expierienced guys which could help me out with this problem ?<br /><br />Normally I buy my Bitcoins from a platform like bitcoin.de or mtgox, but if i buy there i always have to wait nearly a week until i got them.<br />Please forgive my ignorance, i just look for a solution once and for all. if there is one.<br /><br />Sorry for my bad english, i just hope its understandable ^^<br /><br /><br />love ya all&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />-mupfel

				Hi mupfel! Just registered to answer you. I´m also from Germany. To buy bitcoins I use bitcoin-24.com. There you can deposit your money via sofortüberweisung, which means, your money will be immediately on your account to buy bitcoins. I have made some transactions until now and there was only 1 time a little problem, but that was caused by sofortüberweisung and the support there was helpfull. If you make your first transaction on bitcoin-24, you are limited to 50 Euros for the first day, I guess. But you can make a few transactions one after another. But you have to pay a fee, so it´s more expensive. In my opinion, the fee isn´t very high and I personally have no problem with it. You have to decide on your own, but I would recommend this side (and I have nothing to do with it, I´m only a customer there)

				I&#039;d suggest using www.bitcoin.de <br />It&#039;s very easy to use, safe and only 0,005% commission. So you get pretty much as much coins as you pay for. :P<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Hi,<br /><br />another noob from .de here. Do you guys know of a way to buy bitcoins anonymously? Searching this forum finds me many ways to do that if you&#039;re not living in .de, but no way if you do.&nbsp; :( e.g. Paysafecard seems to require a german cell phone.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Cheers

				on wednesday night i tried to buy bitcoins anonymously for the first time via anonxchange, despite of the high fee (15%)<br />and without reading any reviews about their service.<br />i bought two paysafecards (20€, 50€) and exchanged the 20€ card on the website for testing.<br />within 2 hours i had my bitcoins. therefore i exchanged the 50€ card and until now, noting happend :-(<br />ripped off before i made my first transaction on SR *lol*<br /><br />i discourage using anonexchange<br /><br />
