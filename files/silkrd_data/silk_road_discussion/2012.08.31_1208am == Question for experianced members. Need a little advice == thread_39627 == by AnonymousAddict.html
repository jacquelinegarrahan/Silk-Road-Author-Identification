				Ok, friday or saturday i plan on using bitinstant to send BTC direcly to my SR wallet. My question is after i go to the bank or cvs wherever i decide to go to put the money on this great place how long will it take before the BTC show up On the SR account? Sorry for all the questions guys but i wanna make sure i do this right. SO correct if wrong. I go to bitinstant, select how im gonna pay and to send to wallet adress(SR) one, and then i go deposite the money at the location correct? and then it will be here on SR in a matter of hours right? Thanks for the help guys. Also the guy RXking who sells BTC and says he chages no interest is that trust worthy?

				be aware yout first transfer takes a long time for some reason...my first time doing exactly theprocess you are decribing, rom WU took almost 9 houre.&nbsp; i of course was emailing bitinstant (who had their CEO email me back perosnally and look into it.&nbsp; he sadi the first order takes awhile,he was a good guy...- after that first one, usually by the time i get back from the store (about 30-40mi ute, thetransfer has started or is about tostart. good luck and though this sounds simple, if it sounds too good to be tru it is. <br />I have been erring on the side of paying more for sn estwblished vendor and feeling sagfe.
