				Someone shared a link on here a while back about a service that will send you int mail as a test.&nbsp; Been looking online but can&#039;t find it. <br /><br />I want to test to see if my address has been flagged. <br /><br />I&#039;m receiving domestic mail and some int but two out of three packages from the Xmas-ish period didn&#039;t show. <br />

				You could always order a $2 item from eBay in your country of choice (eBay is found in most countries around the world). Also, just because an item didn&#039;t arrive doesn&#039;t mean your address is flagged. The vendor may not have sent it (selective scamming), it could have been intercepted by Custom&#039;s in the country from where it was sent or possibly by Aussie Customs, lost in the system with the extra mail at Xmas or even stolen by the postie himself (very unlikely). In the beginning of my SR journey, I had 2 order&#039;s from O/S not arrive, yet a little over a year has passed since then and I haven&#039;t lost one since.&nbsp; :)

				That&#039;s one example most reputable vendor&#039;s employ already to assist in getting an order &quot;over the line.&quot; You could ask some more specific questions with the vendor/s in question by sending them a message, requesting firstly if you could get some more info. on a particular shipping method you want them to use if you send them a second message, encrypted with PGP, to protect any details. They won&#039;t go into specifics of course, but instead give you an idea of what they do. You could also ask the forum if anyone has received an order recently from the vendor. If you do get some responses, hit them up with a PM for some details on the professionalism of the&nbsp; vendor&#039;s shipping. You don&#039;t need to know much really other than was it professionally done, stealthily packaged using quality products and would they be confident in ordering again from them? If you get 4 yes&#039;s than order away and if not, make a common sense decision that won&#039;t stress you out. :)

				Yeah so not to point out the obvious here but if your address is flagged and you get something that is not illegal sent to you what exactly are you hoping to learn?<br /><br />They don&#039;t just stop delivering all of your mail or open every item you get. At best they look with more scrutiny at the packages you are receiving. Think X-Ray, dogs, physical external examination, these people have to do paperwork still to violate your rights and that&#039;s not likely to happen for everyday items coming to your address.<br /><br />The services you are thinking of were designed to test / establish an address for deliverablty. For example to set a pattern for delivering to a fake name or confirm that said fake named mail will be delivered.<br /><br />If you really wanted to test the system without a huge amount of risk order some prescription medication (i.e. Viagra) from an online pharmacy that delivers from the country of your choice. If it gets through odds are so will everything else.

If its all clear the package is let go - looking for this hole indicates if my mail is under greater scrutiny. <br /><br />I do like your thinking about ordering something else such as Viagra however I&#039;ve ordered pills before (legal ones) and due to their shape they&#039;ve been held at customs so although they got through I had to sign for them. <br /><br />@wadozo I&#039;ve had successful purchases from two of the three packages while the third one is renowned as having some of the best stealth on SR. <br /><br />I&#039;m in a bit of a pickle I reckon.
