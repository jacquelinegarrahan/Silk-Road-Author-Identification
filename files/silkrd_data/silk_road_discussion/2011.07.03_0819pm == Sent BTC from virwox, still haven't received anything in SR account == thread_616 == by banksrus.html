				It&#039;s been 5 hours now and i&#039;m feeling uneasy about this. Sent 10BTC to my SR generated bitcoin account from virwox and still nothing. Last time i tried it out for 1 BTC and it took like 5 minutes. Now it&#039;s 5 hours.<br /><br />Anyone else experiencing this? What can i do? Is my money safe?

				virwox manuals approves all btc transfers, buying on the weekend means you will probably have to wait until monday, maybe tuesday if its based in the states. you can try emailing them but i bought from them once and it was on weekend and had to wait until monday and even then i didnt get them til the afternoon. you should have transfered to a bitcoin wallet first. not sure how its going to work with sr with only having a 6hr number.

				As with what lvlbrained said, you should always transfer from your exchange to either a wallet on your PC or an online wallet like mybitcoin.com.<br /><br />It seems that a lot of people have had issues with the time it takes Virwox to process transactions and also trying to send them them directly to a site that sells drugs could expose you if they handed over their records to the Feds.

				It&#039;s not from virwox&#039;s end. I cashed out the BTC from virwox to my SR generated BTC purse number and had to wait like 1.5 hours untill they emailed me about the funds being sent out (it&#039;s called manual step). After that was done the money should&#039;ve shown up in my SR account but it hasn&#039;t and it&#039;s been 6+ hours now.
