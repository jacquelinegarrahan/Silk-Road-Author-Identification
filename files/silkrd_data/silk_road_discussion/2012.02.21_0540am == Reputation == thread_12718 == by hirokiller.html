				So I&#039;m new here and looking to get some reputation so people will know I&#039;m a good buyer, what would be the best course of action to go about doing this? I would rather not buy something I have no use for.

				Contribute POSITIVELY to forums threads.<br /><br />Make purchases and leave feedback - review their product under the appropriate forum threads.&nbsp; Vendors love to hear good reviews of their stuff and they will recognize your name. It also helps prospective buyers as well.<br /><br />Being a &quot;reputable&quot; buyer is a given.. just stay reputable.&nbsp; Once your feedback gets to 5-10 and no refunds you will have no limitations from vendors most likely.

				There is no need to link your SR account and forum account together, in fact many buyers choose to use different IDs for both. That said most venders will happily sell to new buyers so as long as you do your research you shouldn&#039;t have any problem quickly building a good reputation. Venders usually only get picky if you have an abnormal amount of refunds or disputes, but your mileage may vary.

				I was wondering about separate ids for the forum and SR.&nbsp; Why do that?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t it better, if a person is legit, to use the same ids?&nbsp; (<br /><br />(And everyone should definitely watch that youtube about never talking to the police!)^^^^

				Most vendors look at your purchasing stats to get an idea of your reputation, along with if your active on the boards or not....<br /><br />At least this has been my experience.<br /><br />Want a good rep. as a buyer, you have to buy.<br /><br />Keep buying and over time you will develop a rep. as a solid customer.<br /><br />Kinda common sense if you think about it.
