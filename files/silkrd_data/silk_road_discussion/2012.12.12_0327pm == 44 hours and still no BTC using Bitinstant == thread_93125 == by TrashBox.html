				Probably best to PM you. I have had some great responses from their customer service. They are good people. This is the middle of Chanukah, and I assume the slowdown may have something to do with that. Many of the names I&#039;ve dealt with there are Hebrew. Not being judgmental, I&#039;m just from the area-(Long Island/NYC). Things tend to slow down because of Chanukah + Christmas.<br /><br />I&#039;ll check it out, and PM you back. <br /><br />Hang in there. <br /><br />Also, always take screen shots of each page (might be too late now), if you need help doing that, I&#039;ll teach you as well. - Hang in there. I&#039;ll do what I can.

				Haven&#039;t heard from you! Hopefully your problem is resolved. I already sent them a message, just stating that someone on a Bulletin Board, used by Bitcoin Shoppers. (Believe me they don&#039;t want to hear the name Silk Road or even a hint at the initials SR) <br /><br />They instantly replied, that my message was received an would be responded to ASAP.<br /><br />Tell us show you did!!<br /><br />Good Luck!

				They are all correct. <br /><br />I&#039;m a man, and accept the lumps I&#039;m being given here.&nbsp; I did post a ridiculous rant about &quot;taking down SR&quot; <br /><br />I will remove that. I was pissed because I had just gotten scammed. After 30 transactions, and excellent stats, you&#039;d think I&#039;d have learned. <br /><br />Also (and this is no excuse-just a reason) I was out of adderall, and was going through those 3-4 depressing days that follow, for me anyway. Mix that with Xanax and Alcohol, and I&#039;m one big asshole. <br /><br />All good advice about not giving your name to &quot;this guy&quot; though. - I was just going to ask for your last name or something, not get &quot;all your info&quot; <br /><br />I was being sincere in my desire to help. I was the noobiest newbie, and so many good people helped me, I just wanted to return the favor. <br /><br />These are my buying stats. Just to show you I&#039;m no lurker or whatever it was I was called. &quot;Troll&quot; I think.<br />Total transactions: 38<br />Total spent: $2271.86<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 8 months<br /><br />Though I&#039;ve been on SR since April, I never really got into the forums that much until the outtage last month. So that&#039;s what took me so long to get up to 100 posts. Not that amount of posts means anything really,&nbsp; but it does carry with it a reputation, and I have to defend that. As well as fess up when I&#039;ve been an asshole. <br /><br />So sorry about that post on the DPR &quot;Update&quot; Thread. <br /><br />It&#039;s coming down now. -<br /><br />Just another mixed up drug addict I guess. <br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t Judge Me Too Harshly&quot; - Brian Jones&#039;s epitaph. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />I&#039;m sure BitInstant will help you out. Try the phone number they list for urgent matters, is my best advice. <br /><br />I can see now, how I looked pretty shady with my willingness to help. <br /><br />Good thing there are good people on here, that cautioned you, It was the the right thing to do. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to go enjoy the speed I finally got this morning, and I have a few more &quot;real life&quot; apologies to make. <br /><br />Take it easy everyone. <br /><br />Again, I apologize for my idiotic behavior on the other thread, - fixing that now. <br /><br />Jagfug

Also.... don&#039;t use bitcoin address method that is Stuipd! You&#039;re supposed to transfer the USD to either Mt.Gox or BTC-e.This allows you to make trades at the lowest market value. BTC-e has less fees than Mt.Gox.... about half the fees. Call Rachael. She will get you fixed up in about 5 mins. You should have called first thing.

				Come to think of it, the last 3 Bitinstant transfers I&#039;ve done, I&#039;ve needed to call Bitinstant CSR. This is probably something they are doing to collect free money from those who give fake info. Warning. Using Bitinstant with fake names may cause you to give your money to them for free (this is unverified). Next time use your real info and then send your bitcoins to Bitfog before you come to SR. Shes gonna ask you for your name.
