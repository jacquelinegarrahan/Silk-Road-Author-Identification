				I suggest that we take action and not open or reply to the BTC scam asshole who keeps spamming the forums. We should make an effort to ignore these posts and busy ourselves posting in other threads and creating interesting topics in new threads.&nbsp; If we keep this forum busy enough then we can push the offending threads to the bottom and perhaps discourage him/her entirely.&nbsp; Obviously it won&#039;t work if we make pointless threads since no one will read or respond.<br /><br />Hopefully this can also prevent gullible people from giving this asshole any money.

				message indica|sativa or DPR to enable the captcha to post if post count is &lt; I say 50. probably won&#039;t stop the spammers, but it might slow them down so the spambusters can keep up a touch better

				He is most likely using something like Xrumer to do this. DPR has probably heard of it, maybe not, its a marketing software for posting to forums / blogs. Captchas might work, there should DEFINITELY be a captcha requirement here. I can&#039;t believe there isn&#039;t some sort of security. <br /><br />Beyond that, most of those softwares have captcha solving features, so besides just captchas, there should be a question/answer type capatcha that only a human could answer such as &quot;what does this picture show?&quot; or what is &quot;2+5=?&quot; for people who have under X amount of posts.

				OK, well let&#039;s ALL message DPR, indica/satvia any other person with the ability to do something.<br /><br />And please just try my idea of bumping threads (not with spam but just read some stuff and contribute).&nbsp; If everyone who reads this could take a minute or two and bump or create a thread we CAN stop this asshole from getting any customers.<br /><br />No customers=/= no more posts clogging up the board!&nbsp; Come on guys, let&#039;s give it a try.&nbsp; I hate to see someone succeed at robbing innocent people.&nbsp; He has to be getting some victims through the forums since he has been doing this for over a month now.

				I agree that something needs to be done. However kitkat you seriously need to brush up on your forum etiquette. I do not appreciate the incredibly unfounded, and rude message you sent me calling me the BTC scammer/spammer:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You are a pathetic piece of shit.&nbsp; How can you live with yourself?&nbsp; Scamming sociopath, trying to take advantage of people.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not only this but you downrepped me. That pisses me off.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am a legitimate buyer. I do not have any product to sell. I have not been around long but I am a trustworthy user. I will never ask anyone for their bitcoins and the only business I will do is on my account through the silk road with reputable vendors. There are a few vendors I have used multiple times that I&#039;m sure, if I asked, would vouch for me.<br /><br />Total transactions: 10<br />Total spent: à¸¿45.8<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 1 month<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m curious as to why I am the target of your nasty message.<br /><br />Have a nice day kitkat82. <br /><br />

				I agree this Bit-Coin Spamming is getting a bit ridiculous I usually don&#039;t mind it, but this much on each page is outrageous. Not that it makes me mad though, but troublesome to find topics now as you have to go 5 pages back ...

				if anyone else has any ideas to combat the spamming please offer your suggestions<br /><br />something definitely needs to be done. i wake up and find over 250 threads, which i have to go through and delete one by one - taking an hour an a half to remove, its getting ridiculous. i dont have time to do anything else but sit here and remove the threads, then once theyre gone another fifty are posted <br /><br />i think it has to be some kind of automatic posting, because 3 or 4 will appear in a matter of 30 seconds, it may not be though because yesterday he started trying to use a couple different titles on a few posts to see if they would stop being deleted.&nbsp; <br /><br />and the spammer is fucking stupid cause theres nothing more obvious its a scam than having a couple hundred threads about it
