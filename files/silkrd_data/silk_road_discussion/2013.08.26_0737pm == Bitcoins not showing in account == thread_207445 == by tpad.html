				My coins were sent ~3 hours ago and I&#039;m still waiting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard of this happening several times before so I&#039;m not trippin&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just go to sleep soon and by the time I wake up the odds are they&#039;ll be there.<br /><br />It probably sucks for people who are in a rush to get their gear though.

				I tried to withdrawl coins about 1h ago and it hasnt shown up in blockchain yet.&nbsp; Not much you can do but wait ;) <br />And assume that the ratings update that they are rolling out RIGHT now has something to do with it.&nbsp; Should be in your account in a couple few hrs.
