				Is anyone out there addicted to SR. Cant stop looking at stuff or reading reviews and deciding what to get. Do you get a rush from just ordering something? Do&nbsp; you feel almost addicted to the process of actually making a purchase?

				I spend wayyyy too much time lurking on the forum. I also compulsively check the listings--be it to drool over items on my wishlist or just to see what&#039;s new. My curiosity with all things taboo and drug related has made logging into this site a weird little hobby that goes beyond mere consumption of illicit substances. It&#039;s endless entertainment for me. :D

				Haven&#039;t been around for long, I&#039;m addicted to SR in the sense that I want to know as much as possible to secure my safety/anonymity, so I visit this forum frequently. You can never have too much knowledge.

				I have to say I&#039;m more addicted to window shopping on SR (and reading, posting in forums), just not to buying itself. Like I buy twice a month at most. Sometimes I even skip a month at buying. 7 months a member and only $159 BTC spent total. I am a cheap bastard with a budget. If I had more money to spend, would I? ehhh maybe ::shrugs::

				Oh yes I am addicted to SR. I planed for a whole month on which drugs to get for my birthday and when to order them so that they don&#039;t arrive neither too late nor too early.<br /><br />But what is really killing me is when my deliveries are on the way and I am waiting for them, the whole time I will shake of anxiety and so I drink alcohol to kill the anxiety.And then when my order arrives I will feel relieved until it is the evening that I plan to take them then I will shake even more of nervousness then before.That&#039;s really killing me sometimes this fear about your package not arriving can drive you crazy.

				I think its cause its such a ritual to actually get your purchase and shit..<br /><br />The pillgrimage - buying the bitcoins and getting them to SR<br />The communion - ordering the stuff and finalising<br />The prayer - waiting for the post<br /><br />And then its just such a relief when the shit arrives.

				No, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m addicted to SR. That would be kind of retarded.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think all of you are addicted either, but you probably like it a whole lot.

				I spend about an hour a day on the forums just keeping up with things.&nbsp; I just enjoy learning about things which I was previously clueless about.&nbsp; SR has opened my eyes on many things.<br /><br />24 transactions in about 4 months on here.&nbsp; So yeah, I buy a lot too!
