				So I know i just got scammed by the vendor I am dealing with for bulk mj but the money is still in escrow. A couple of other people FE also for bulk mj and got screwed on thousands of dollars. It has been a week, i payed for express shipping and says it has been shipped claims that the tracking says the package has been delivered but I have received nothing and to me its pretty obvious from other peoples cases I will not be receiving anything.<br /><br />My question is when it goes to resolution will I be getting my money back or is there no chance? When the vendor was trying to convince me to FE he said this:<br /><br />&quot;SR favors the seller in disputes because they bring the money to the site. They don&#039;t check tracking numbers or anything else.&quot;<br /><br />If this is the case then what is the point of even having a resolution system?<br />If the vendor has scammed people whether they FE or not and their rating is so low its obvious they wont be doing anymore business on the road, why would SR favor the seller??<br /><br />This makes no sense to me and I hope I didnt just lose all of the money I own over something as stupid as this. I thought the escrow system was for protection.

				The escrow system IS for protection.&nbsp; If the vendor has scammed those who did finalize early, then of course he&#039;s going to try to say whatever he can to try to make you FE as well.&nbsp; It is absolutely NOT true that resolution favors the vendor ... ESPECIALLY if that vendor has a track record of FE orders disappearing before reaching the buyer.<br /><br />Stay in escrow - do not FE just because this asshole is trying to scary you into it.

				Document everything. When in resolution, write a rational, logical explanation of why you deserve a full refund. If you can&#039;t do this yourself, find a friend or associate that you know to be rational and logical to do it for you.<br /><br />I have seen a lot of people on the forums with good cases for refunds, but unfortunately most of them have not been able to express themselves in a way that is satisfactory to third parties.
