				The vendor NOD did NOT get caught because of anything at all to do with DPR&#039;s demise. He got caught because he used a return address tied to him on a package sent to Alaska that got intercepted, and the buyer snitched and said that he bought it off of SR from a vendor named NOD. They surveiled the return address, and voila! Fucking retard!!<br /><br />It was just pure coincidence that it happened at the same time.

				Hey friend. According to the article you linked, it appears that he just plain got busted on his own with the ABC&#039;s then tying him into SR later. <br /><br />******Sadler sent the drugs through the U.S. Mail, where a drug detection dog alerted authorities to an express mail package. Inside, Post Office inspectors found heroin hidden in a birthday card, and scented markers.<br />Investigators say they used a return address on some of the boxes to track down Sadler, and installed tracking devices on Sadler and his co-defendant&#039;s vehicles. During surveillance, the cars traveled to at least 38 Post Offices in the Seattle area.****<br /><br />Some may remember the Farmers Market bust. Those guys were all arrested at the same time and all had been being watched for a considerable amount of time. I&#039;m not going to relax at all but I really do think besides the esteemed DPR, they don&#039;t have too much. Why didn&#039;t they get the mods who were being paid very well to run the site? Now the mods have had the chance to disappear and anything they might have to link to them destroyed. <br /><br />Personally, I think the feds bust was a *bust* and no BFD for most of the rest of us. :-) That doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m going to run over to the other markets&nbsp; like some have. I may for awhile but am holding out for a new and improved substitute. I just hope to God someone has the brains to create one. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=218004.msg1589899#msg1589899">Quote from: IForgotMyFuckingPassword on October 04, 2013, 05:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=218004.msg1589761#msg1589761">Quote from: ReblzRox on October 04, 2013, 04:59 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Big bad alphabet soup boys only snagged the owner.

That paragraph is kind of poorly written. But I still don&#039;t think that it&#039;s a &quot;coincidence&quot; that it happened at the same time. When they were ready to bust DPR, they probably moved on others so that they didn&#039;t have a chance to flee.

				They can&#039;t do fuck all but try and disrupt and scare us.....lets hit back with using such methods as PGP and Stealth OS&#039;s like Tails.......all they are doing is trying to scare us because of the arrest of a &quot;leader&quot;.....i guarantee you if the trends go on and they continue to arrest two or three people in a few years time its just gonnna go bad for them. Once the public and everyone knows we are fine and just moved on they will see how unstopable the people really are.<br /><br />&nbsp;We need to be smart though.
