				I won&#039;t reveal the name of the seller I&#039;m talking about just yet (if you follow my post history, you&#039;ll find out). So this is what happened.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Update: vendor name is Larghetto , and if you read this Larghetto, finish this sentence because there is an important message for you on the back of it..... FUCK YOU!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1) You order a product from a US vendor, adderall in my case.<br /><br />2) Products gets to me in 2 weeks, postal markings indicate Philippines.&nbsp; Weird huh? Vendor never talked about being a middle man.<br /><br />3) Month later or so I receive a small amount (little value) of a product I don&#039;t use so i give it away. Weird again? Is my personal info on some desk in Asia ?<br /><br />4) Because the original product was not bad I continue to use the seller until I finally get ripped of (the one time you thrust the guy and F/E because you order just before going on holiday). Why did I continue to order ? Well the damage was already done, my personal info was shared and saved.<br /><br />5) After being scammed I stop ordering from this vendor. Almost 8 months later I receive a letter, A4 format with just a message telling me (in short) &quot;HI, i&#039;m the source of the product you used to order on SR. You can order it directly from me from now on&quot;. Source of letter: &quot;Phillipines&quot; <br /><br />6) I verify that he is the source, requesting details on packaging, dosage, pictures. He gives me everything, i&#039;m sure he was the original source &quot;Phillipines&quot;.<br /><br />7) I communicate with the guy and notice a few things. First of all, he thinks the torrent network and the tor network are the same thing, meaning he runs a very insecure operation. He doesn&#039;t know how to use encryption so chances my personal info is in encrypted form are non-existent and he ONLY accept Western Union.<br /><br />This last thing means that the SR vendor had to buy his product using Western Union and the SR vendor will be fucked by LE in the long term. Both the vendor (very insecure person) and the big time supplier in Asia have my personal info and they will be connected to each other by LE.<br /><br />But, before you say; I did this to myself. Remember, I didn&#039;t know, the vendor is still active and made &quot;more than 300 transactions&quot; and has almost 600 fans, so his actual transactions must me more than 1000. Start panicking because A lot of us are going to popup on some LE&#039;s radar.&nbsp; Big lesson, look behind the security tor, sr provides. The human factor can fuck you over big time!

				Lol, I live in a low profile country where LE isn&#039;t paying much attention to drug related crime anyway. And I don&#039;t have a stock that would even make it profitable for LE to bust me but I assume some people who worked themselves in the same situation might get into deeper shit.

Why&#039;s that? At some point someone has to decrypt it into plain text. You have 0 assurance that your decrypted info is destroyed. None. Even though the majority of vendors likely do destroy it because it&#039;s evidence. <br /><br />But, screw over a vendor or leave bad feedback score over something relatively trivial without contacting them first and ignoring their PMs and they will likely store your name and address in case you switch user names. But they probably store it encrypted. Who knows. <br /><br />That&#039;s why it pays to be cool. Just like on the street. <br /><br />

				LE don&#039;t have the resources to go after buyers. how much did you buy? Like a couple grams or a couple kilos? If you were buying a large amount then take this as a lesson learned that you need to find out if the vendor is trustworthy, and hope that LE doesn&#039;t catch him or want to track you down if they do. If the listing says ships from USA and doesn&#039;t, then definitely, leave bad feedback, let it be known because that is bullshit.

I payed 6.33 bc for my last 120x adderall order and because of bitcoin fluctuation and the fact I was leaving the country for 2 weeks I F/E&#039;d. The time I finalized 1bc was 260 USD. So He made at least a profit of 800 USD even if he got scammed (if he handled the situation right and wasn&#039;t speculating with my money). Up until this day he doesn&#039;t want to give me a fair 3bc refund. I feel the same as alot of people here on the forum, he has to go. I feel like SR is protecting him because he once generated profit (fees) . He has been selectively scamming people from the start. I don&#039;t think SR staff should allow him to get his shit together and get his rating to &gt;95 again. It will be just a matter of time before he does the exact same thing.<br /><br />The last thing he told me after I kindly explained our history and the whole situation to him again in PM he answered<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,<br /><br /><br />I do not know what you are talking about.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Larghetto</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What a DICK!

				Your life will be ruined if LE in your country has the funds to go after guys that buy small quantities for personal consumption, which I think is nowhere, and if your shipping big quantities of stuff to a drop is a big irresponsibility to send them to the same place where you have your stash or where you work from.

I payed 6.33 bc for my last 120x adderall order and because of bitcoin fluctuation and the fact I was leaving the country for 2 weeks I F/E&#039;d. The time I finalized 1bc was 260 USD. So He made at least a profit of 800 USD even if he got scammed (if he handled the situation right and wasn&#039;t speculating with my money). Up until this day he doesn&#039;t want to give me a fair 3bc refund. I feel the same as alot of people here on the forum, he has to go. I feel like SR is protecting him because he once generated profit (fees) . He has been selectively scamming people from the start. I don&#039;t think SR staff should allow him to get his shit together and get his rating to &gt;95 again. It will be just a matter of time before he does the exact same thing.<br /><br />The last thing he told me after I kindly explained our history and the whole situation to him again in PM he answered<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,<br /><br /><br />I do not know what you are talking about.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Larghetto</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What a DICK!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Larghetto has been well known as bad news for a long time..&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry. :(

				True; Larghetto seemed to be bad news. I think his audience is First time buyers or people with low stats. Anyway, my life isn&#039;t going to be ruined off course, in my country they can&#039;t even keep serial killers in jail for more than 8 years most of the time. But let this topic be a BIG WARNING to anyone who thinks about business with this joke of a vendor.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				LE in the US doesn&#039;t really care about prescription meds in the mail unless they are schedule 2.&nbsp; They catch thousands of packages of prescriptions everyday.&nbsp; There has been clearnet suppliers operating for a decade or longer.&nbsp; They don&#039;t bust the buyers and they rarely mess with the suppliers in other countries.

				The buyer should not FE if he or she has enough coin spent.<br /><br />The only exception might be bitcoin price drops, I&#039;ve had orders cancelled due to bitcoin instability.<br /><br />Sounds like you found a bad vendor!

Larghetto had a rating of 96 at the time. The product I ordered just said 20mg generic adderall. Do you think he would have told me &quot;Hey, you know... These pills I sell. They are comming from an idiot in Asia. I&#039;m going to mail him your info in plain text and he will save it in outlook&quot;...... I Don&#039;t think so.<br /><br />When I got the product (like I said, first deal went &quot;almost&quot;) normal. It was this pill<br /><br />http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2647<br />http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2516<br />http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2428<br /><br />I tried them and they where of good quality so I think they where made in a (semi) pro lab. Again, I know that they weren&#039;t exactly adderall (combo of amphs) but I can assure you they felt the same and the dosage was spot on (can tell out of experience). There where also no weird unexpected side effects and most important he sold them for 1/3 of the price of any other adderall listing.<br /><br />I would have been OK with it if he shipped the product from the Philippines to himself and resold it from there it would have been more honest. But the fact that he shares buyers information in clear text is unforgivable. When you order from Larghetto your info is stored, shared and may even be sold.
