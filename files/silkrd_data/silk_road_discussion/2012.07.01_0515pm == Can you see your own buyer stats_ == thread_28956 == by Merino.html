				I&#039;m new and quickly got the message to buy a few books, digital items, etc. I&#039;ve done my five, finalized all the transactions, given the vendors a rating, etc. Do the vendors leave ratings for buyers? I don&#039;t see a place to check my own stats, am I missing something obvious?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know whether the transactions have been broadcast and if not how long it takes. I have a couple vendors I&#039;d like to order from that don&#039;t deal w/ anyone who doesn&#039;t have the five transactions and of course I don&#039;t want to FE on any large orders.

				go to account, and click purchasing stats.&nbsp; &nbsp;My understanding is that is what vendors see when you place an order...<br /><br />I check mine somewhat regularly, and just hit the 1-year mark yesterday :-)

				I can suck my own... oh, hold on, different subject.<br /><br />Click on &#039;account&#039; at the top.<br />Then click on &#039;Purchasing stats&#039; on the right, on your account page.<br /><br />Remember, purchasing low value items (such as e-books), may give you a greater number of purchases. But your &#039;Total spent&#039; will still be low. This may (or may not) influence a vendor, who&#039;s making his decision based on your Purchasing stats.<br /><br />Good luck fellow Roadie!

				Can anyone explain how stats can be negatively effected?&nbsp; Is it only if you ask for refunds?&nbsp; Or can canceling an order while it&#039;s still pending have a poor impact?&nbsp; Thinking about canceling because I haven&#039;t had any communication from the vendor, but willing to wait it out if it will adversely effect my stats.

				Canceling an order will not affect your stats. Only refunds and auto finalize will show up. Vendors hate to wait for their money. And if you have a high refund rate then you may be a scammer.

				Out of curiosity, do you know how long it takes the funds to find their way back to your account after canceling?

				It should be instant. You may have to pay a 4% fee though, if the listing was hedged.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=29826.0

				Oh, awesome.&nbsp; I was definitely expecting a delay.&nbsp; Yeah I&#039;ve head the 4% thing, and that&#039;s a small price to pay as far as I&#039;m concerned.&nbsp; &nbsp; Will definitely be holding off on canceling for a while.&nbsp; Thanks for your help!

				&quot;I&#039;ve done my five&quot;<br /><br />Whats this about having to have 5 orders? Sorry if thats a newb question. Is that to gain some street cred so that sellers of more sensitive items will deal with you? I just did my first after lurking a good while. I had to enter it about 6 times before it took. Is that the norm? I&#039;m using firefox.
