				I always thought these things were a fraud/rip-off, but I just got 0.02btc sent back to me unexpectedly from a vendor who is combining the postage of multiple orders, I organised &quot;Drugs&quot; by &quot;Cheapest&quot; and decided to play one by Dr Greenfingers just for the fun of trying/curiosity.<br /><br />The bio states it must end in an &quot;e&quot; to win, which is a 1 in 16 chance of winning.<br /><br />My transaction ends in e.<br /><br />Fuck yeah.

				I agree in general I think they are scams. There was a vendor I dealt with once who quickly built up 100 feedback without shipping a single product. They were all lotteries and he &quot;notified the winners via PM&quot; and never made them public. I think lottos would be a cool concept but there would need to be some impartial oversight to insure there actually were winners and they actually were paid. Almost all the ones I&#039;ve seen have been to build stats or bury negative feedback. A vendor who scams for a bit takes a huge feedback and rating hit and with a lotto can bury that pages back after a bunch of meaningless fluff feedback. They almost all involved a listing that you immediately finalize, leave 5/5 feedback and never know if anyone won.

				Just don&#039;t play WalMart&#039;s lotteries. You would have better luck getting blood out of a turnip than getting that asshole to pay off winning transactions. Just by looking at his feedback he rarely sells anything besides lotto playsand his profile freely states he can&#039;t manage his money or his drugs any better than a 5 year old could.

				Yeah the transaction ID is a creative idea. Haven&#039;t heard of that before, cool concept, and hey, you won something so that is very cool. I think they&#039;d be a fun concept that could also be profitable for a vendor if there was a way to do them legitimately. Cool concept neverFE - take you out of the role of picking winners and is transparent. Hope it works well for you and gets you some business. It&#039;s a good way to get your new account started and build up some feedback. As long as you&#039;re doing it the way you&#039;re doing it and ship to the winners it seems like a win-win! Best of luck with it.<br />

				thanks pat, in 3 days I already have 18 orders that aren&#039;t lottery based so I will have plenty of feedback as 6 have already received their order from monday.&nbsp; I am always super fast and super stealthy with my orders as I strive for 100% customer satisfaction.&nbsp; Hit me up if you ever need adderall :D

They were the transaction Id type. <br />I still have the same cannabis listings up as I did before though, so not sure why you think I only deal in lotteries.<br /><br />As for my feedback, most of it is cannabis orders, although some of the lottery orders can be found throughout towards the end. <br /><br />Not having ample funds is not the same thing as bad with money, however I am very experienced on both handling and growing the drugs I sell, but unfortunately Medical Grade is only available through State Registered Growers, not &quot;some guy that grows&quot;. Yes, I could cut out the middleman and sell sub-par cannabis, or sell at the same price and offer medical grade.

				I think I run the cleanest ship as regards lotteries as the scams and misleading odds really pissed me off when I first got here.<br /><br />I run two lotteries and foe each the winner decided by random TX# which&nbsp; I have no control of, Usernames of winners published on page daily so you can potentially search them and ask did they get money. Links to my vendor feedback page here on the forum which every buyer is made aware of so if they don&#039;t get their money they can complain publicly here. <br /><br />If anyone can see how it could be made more transparent on my behalf feel free to poke holes, <br />I really hate scammers so I pretty much run my own lottery 100% by the book with lowest odds to piss them off.

				I don&#039;t particularly like lotteries on the road.&nbsp; The expected returns are sometimes quite atrocious if you work them out.&nbsp; Plus in partaking you are reducing the usefulness of vendor feedback.&nbsp; If I want to gamble bitcoins I&#039;ll take it off the road.&nbsp; Somewhere like peerbet (100% expected return) or satoshidice (98.1% expected return).

				The nature of gambling lends itself to people wishing to take advantage of others.<br /><br />That being said, the transaction ID is indeed a very innovative method of running a lottery service, as it is a number provided by Silk Road and randomly generated.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t expect any official admin endorsement of these type of lotteries, but it is at least mathematically legitimate, aside from people claiming misleading odds.<br /><br />Much better than the &quot;I&#039;ll put everyone&#039;s name in a hat after two weeks and message the winner!&quot; scams. <br /><br />However, lotteries don&#039;t have to be nefarious in nature or have misleading odds or a huge house cut.<br /><br />I will also add that I don&#039;t think it is appropriate for a libertarian/freedom-oriented site to go around regulating the lotteries just because they have bad odds. The free market should solve this problem by itself, and if people want to throw their money away on something, well...I guess that&#039;s life for you. At some level to really accept the philosophy of freedom you have to admit that it&#039;s okay for people to have to suffer the consequences of their stupidity. <br /><br /><br />[shameless advertising bandwagon]<br /><br />I have several lotteries for my AAA organic buds, and I only markup the overall cost slightly because of increased fees and management time to process lottery tickets.<br /><br />Otherwise, you&#039;re basically getting my weed for the same prices, but in fun lottery format that can allow you to win an ounce for a couple bucks. I NEVER require anyone to finalize before they have received their weed. I do not have lotteries for weed that I don&#039;t have immediately on hand and ready to ship. <br /><br />For example, my 3.5g Lottery for $0.25, which almost a dozen people have won and successfully received their weed from:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/862ae414cd<br /><br />I also run the now massively popular instant betting game that allows you double, triple, or quadruple any amount of bitcoin between $0.10 and $100 worth that you&#039;d like to bet. Very simple 1:16 odds for each possibility, read more here:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f4f393e47b<br /><br /><br />[/shameless advertising bandwagon]<br /><br /><br />
