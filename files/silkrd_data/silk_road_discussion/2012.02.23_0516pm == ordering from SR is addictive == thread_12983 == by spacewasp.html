				Though, in this case, if you can afford to stock up, do it. You never know what will happen to a vendor or even SR. <br /><br />You don&#039;t want to be caught out there having to go through withdrawals or having weekend plans dashed. <br /><br />But you&#039;ll also have to exercise a bit of self-control so that you don&#039;t use up your stock pile too soon.

				It&#039;s not just the ordering and going to the post office that&#039;s addictive, its the searching for random/new &amp; exciting things that you can find on SR that you won&#039;t find anywhere else....the vast selection of drugs on SR is one of technologies greatest treasures :) and I love to go &quot;treasure hunting on Silk Road&quot; :)

				For me it&#039;s when I finally find one of the few Sativa strains I&#039;m in love with. I&#039;m always wary, cause it could be done badly so I buy something small (say a quarter), then when it comes in and I have had a bowl or two all the sudden I&#039;ve bought an ounce or 4.<br />Had to just cool it for a bit, save my money; appreciate what I have more. <br /><br />~DigitalAlch

It&#039;s like when you&#039;re 15 and have your first couple beers/bowls of weed... At that point it&#039;s the greatest thing you&#039;ve ever seen/felt before. After a few years of experience though, you realize that it&#039;s not really as great as you first thought it was, and there IS such a thing as over-doing it. Pace yourself.<br /><br />My greatest concern about someone going on these sort of shopping sprees is if they somehow get busted while in possession of 15 different substances which they fully know how to safely and responsibly manage.... In USA you probably get life in &quot;Federal Pound Me In the Ass Prison&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12983.msg123809#msg123809">Quote from: spacewasp on February 23, 2012, 05:16 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />lol, not good for my bank account....<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Not good for your butthole.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />thisisyourbuttholeinprison.jpg<br /><br />I suppose one positive aspect of all the suspicion around new buyers is that it keeps more people from going gung-ho in their purchases as soon as they arrive. When I first got here, I made four orders almost at once (all with top vendors, mind you), three of which were out of escrow due to my null buyer status. Thinking back on it now, it wasn&#039;t wise. Fortunately, it all turned out all right.

				For me, Silk Road has improved on just about every aspect of purchasing drugs.<br /><br />Quality- It&#039;d be an understatement to say the weed I bought where I live is not very good. The first bowl I smoked of weed off the Road was better than any other I had before, easily. The heroin I occasionally get face-to-face can be either great or enough to make me almost&nbsp; immediately start puking for a good 12 hours. Seriously. I have yet to try any from Silk Road, but I imagine it couldn&#039;t be worse.<br />Price- Some complain about prices on here vs. their area and I can see why, but for some product I could probably (and may try at some point) make a living simply on reselling some drugs I purchase on Silk Road, including MDMA.<br />Variety- A few times a month I&#039;ll browse each category fully, except a couple ones like XXX. Of the dozens of items that look interesting to try each time, I&#039;ll pick a couple that I might order that week, or make a note to try later. I&#039;ve sampled roughly ten new substances since I joined the Road, compared to four I started using before.<br />&quot;The Bullshit&quot;- Most of you are familiar with dealing with the bullshit (or perhaps you&#039;ve escaped it too, making purchases solely on the Road): you want something, and your guy &quot;doesn&#039;t have it/just ran out&quot; but &quot;might be able to get it,&quot; and the acquisition of said item ends up becoming an all-night affair, perhaps ending in you doing shitty or similar product you paid too much for in an adverse setting simply because otherwise it would have all been a waste... maybe your guy never shows, and you do nothing for a couple hours... you know, all that bullshit. Now I plan ahead, and within a couple weeks, have enough product to last me several more weeks, at which point I can just order more before I run out.<br />The Acquisition Itself- Getting the mail and seeing a package you&#039;ve been waiting on for a week is a joyous moment. I always get a goofy grin and the wrapping paper may as well be the same wrapping paper I tore off my first video game console. I read the return address, see how the vendor cleverly packaged it, etc. Handing a dude a couple of 20&#039;s while he drops a bag in your hand and mentions how you just got such a good deal or fire product, as he claims every time, can be anything but joyous.<br /><br />Combine those with a few other things, like the huge grin I get whenever my friends say how badly they want the phone number of &quot;my guy&quot; who seems to be able to get me any high quality substance imaginable, and decent deals on said substances. Almost everything about this place is fun and exciting. Browsing, ordering, getting and inspecting the package, and of course using the high quality product you got.<br /><br />Those that don&#039;t have self control who find this place may find their monthly habits turning into weekly, weekly into daily, and their stash of newfound exploits (as well as their wallet) getting depleted depressingly fast, especially if they relied on everything that&#039;s wrong with face-to-face deals (inconvenience to drive to pick up product, products being cut, dealers running out, etc.) to keep the habit from becoming an addiction or total lifestyle. For those, the only suggestion I can think to give is to obtain a timed safe (somehow opens at specific intervals, like every 6 hours or every day, week, whatever), or talk with a friend who could hold onto the goods and only relinquish it at certain times. But we all know that flat out will not happen with some people, and it is a bit worrisome. Finding this place could end up ruining their lives.<br />
