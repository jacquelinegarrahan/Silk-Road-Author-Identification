				I&#039;ve searched through countless FBI site seizures and every single one sticks to protocol. They also cite the exact reasons for why the site has been seized. I 100% believe that some sort of killswitch was activated. The watermark is a clear sign that the FBI hasn&#039;t actually gained control of the site.

				some ppl posting on the redditt forums are claiming coins have hit their back up address, i mean i do agree with the watermark portion, but libertas confirmed the bad news. maybe this means they are waiting for DPRS right hand man, to step in and take over the business now im not sure, but currently things are looking pretty but i hope to god, your outlook is right!

				Actually upon further inspection does anyone else notice the pixelation around the text. Almost like it was cut from somewhere and Photoshopped. I suppose the feds could have made that page quickly and just decided to do a shitty job but at libertyreserve.com you can find a similar seizure but higher quality.

				what if the guy they arrested is just one of the admins or forum mods willing to sacrifice themselves for &quot;the cause&quot;, and the real DPR was in fact 10 steps ahead of the police the whole time, and used this raid as a distraction in order to set up his newer, more anonymous site, that all of our bitcoins got transferred to.

				Strong reasons why the seizure notice is fake:<br /><br />1) They cited the wrong fucking statute - S18 983 (civil seizure) instead of S18 982 (criminal seizure)<br /><br />2) The image quality is utter shit and looks different than normal seizures<br /><br />3) The SR camel is in the background<br /><br />Weak reasons:<br /><br />4) &quot;Hidden Site&quot; has been seized?

				Jpeg Snoop gives the following info about the seizure image.

				Want to say that the camel in background is less questionable to us then the seizure notice in the 1st place.<br /><br />There is NOTHING to seize, it is not a domain, it is a cryptographic function. You can&#039;t seize it. &quot;Hidden Site&quot; ?<br /><br />Many things can be wrong here, we agree but try not to spread FUD. <br /><br />BUT - there is someone arrested and LE believes that person is DPR and the site is down. These are FACTS and there is no hoax.<br /><br />IF the arrest happen as said at 3:15pm PST on 10/1, and there was a dead man switch of sorts or it took awhile for others to find out and enact shutdown procedures that could explain the odd notice. These things are really not relevant right now and only spread Uncertainty and Doubt.<br /><br />There is also very little doubt in our minds that on July 23rd LE DID get a live image of the running SR web server.<br /><br />So whether the seizure notice is real or part of a shutdown plan don matter much right now. LE did get an image at one point and that is a TREASURE trove of information. And there IS a person under arrest that LE strongly believes is DPR.<br /><br />Throwing around conspiracy theories and focusing on the seizure notice is not helpful right now. Maybe it&#039;s best not to look to deeply into it right now.....
