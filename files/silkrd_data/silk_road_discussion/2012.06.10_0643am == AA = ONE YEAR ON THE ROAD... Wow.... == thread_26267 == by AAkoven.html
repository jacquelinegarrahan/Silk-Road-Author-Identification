				Gonna have to step in here and ask a very important question<br /><br /><br />How&#039;s your piece of shit scamming friend Noriega? Give him a fuck you from me and the rest of the forums will you? <br /><br /><br />And another very important question.<br /><br /><br />Why through the end of March/April/May, was yours and Noriega&#039;s seizure rate to the USA higher than EVERY OTHER DUTCH VENDOR?<br /><br />Now granted Aakoven, as you love to repeat frankly all the fucking time, some things will get seized. We know this. You don&#039;t have to keep saying it. Of course, some things will get seized. But the question you haven&#039;t answered, at any point, is why your and Noriega&#039;s seizure rate to the USA was higher than all the other dutch vendors... I looked at all your feedbacks extensively as well as the forums.<br /><br />You and Noriega both said that the issue was &quot;US customs have improved&quot;.<br /><br />Oh really? And how do you know that exactly?<br /><br />Or is it just some bullshit excuse you made up to cover the fact that you and your mate were selectively scamming US orders and trying to pass it off as an inevitability to avoid suspicion.<br /><br />If what you say is true, then all the other dutch vendors should have been reporting the same thing.<br /><br />Note.. I am NOT saying, that the US doesn&#039;t seize more items from NL than from other countries. I have no way of knowing if this is 100% true, but I suspect that they are more interested in incoming dutch parcels for obvious reasons.<br /><br />What I am saying, is that you and your mates (coincidence?) seizure rate for the US, was higher than everyone else coming out of Holland, and that deserves a fucking explanation quick time because your sorry line of shit you keep spouting off doesn&#039;t stand a second look. <br /><br />Also to any of Aakovens buyers.. Yes I am sure he has come through for you, his product is the shit, yes yes.. <br /><br />I just have to call out someone when I sense fucking bullshit, and my spidey sense has been tingling about this guy&nbsp; and his real life scamming piece of shit friend for a long while. Either you&#039;ve been ssing or your packaging has been profiled, and in either case you are the one responsible.<br /><br />So cut the crap and explain yourself and stop hiding behind senseless platitudes.

				I can&#039;t believe it has been that long already.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even add up how much wonderful M you have shared with my part of the world.&nbsp; You have saved marriages, helped grieving parents with the loss of a child, and solidified life long friendships.&nbsp; You have always had great communication, and a &quot;friend&quot; in my eyes.<br />To the people reading the above posts, remember there is a reason he has been here for a year and with a respectable percentage.&nbsp; Remember it is lonely at the top and the only direction to go is down.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have received all of my product from AA (Except 2g of pep that I think was accidentally missed in confusion I created), which is more than I want to say.&nbsp; Almost all was done out of escrow (When it was not illegal per SR rules), he could have easily fucked me and I would have had no recourse other than here on the forum and he handled each transaction with the up most professionalism.&nbsp; <br />The pep, I have received wasn&#039;&#039;t that great...but I really haven&#039;t found anything that stands up against adderall or Juergan&#039;s medical grade.&nbsp; I have not ordered from him in a while, but only because there is cheaper, equal/better quality, better packaging, and most important don&#039;t require FE competitors out there.&nbsp; <br /><br />AA you are an invaluable vendor on this site.&nbsp; I hope to work with you for a very long time.&nbsp; Happy anniversary!&nbsp;

				Well, I have to say, what a self masturbatory reply. And don&#039;t worry, there&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;d order from you anyway. There are people out there with cheaper product just as good.. and very mysteriously... a much lower seizure rate than yours. <br /><br />I should become a seller? I see that is a point of pride my man.. Okay then, props to you for being a big boy seller. Happy now? I used to work in retail. And haters? Fucking reality check mate, you&#039;re not a pop star, you&#039;re a guy that packages drugs. That&#039;s cool, but what&#039;s this shit about how you didn&#039;t want to sell your soul for power like everyone else in a 9 to 5? What a veiled way to make yourself superior. Take your own advice and have some mdma and empathise a bit more with the people that lost the money which you gained. <br /><br />You sound like a 16 year old that just watched a Bill Hicks dvd for the first time. Get over yourself.<br /><br />Let me tell you something champ, you don&#039;t have to be a seller to figure out one thing.<br /><br />1. You have a high seizure rate to the USA<br />2. Other vendors with better packaging have almost ZERO seizures to the USA<br />3. Therefore your packaging isn&#039;t good enough<br /><br />1,2,3, you do the fucking math. Learn some syntax while you&#039;re at it as well.<br /><br />You can&#039;t come on here and complain about scammers and people saying you&#039;re a scammer because your stuff gets seized, when there&#039;s an easy solution right in front of you. So when you moan like a little bitch &quot;awwww poor me I would still have a 100 if it wasn&#039;t for these scammers&quot;.. Go fuck yourself.<br /><br />To say that everyone that didn&#039;t receive from you is a scammer is a fucking insult, undeserving of you, and betrays your arrogance. Perhaps there is something in your own process, that might better repay your criticism? Perhaps those seizures are due to something on your end, and those people that paid you, lost out, because of something you neglected to do. Maybe, just maybe, you&#039;re the fucking guy to blame.<br /><br />But no, that&#039;s impossible. They&#039;re all scammers. You&#039;re a seller, you couldn&#039;t possibly be wrong. Case closed. Get the fuck out of here with that shit.<br /><br />Get. Some. Better. Packaging.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to be a seller to figure that one out. <br /><br />&quot;Some people say I&#039;m a dreamer, but you&#039;re a fucking twat&quot;<br />

It&#039;s a fucking fact.<br /><br />Some people have great packaging, and all their packages get through. Some people have good but not great packaging, and then complain about scammers and why they don&#039;t have a 100, and allay the blame to everyone else like a little bitch without looking at their own procedure. I say.. get better packaging and until then you can&#039;t complain. Then guys come on here shouting &quot;tough guy&quot;.<br /><br />Welcome to SR.<br /><br />&quot;good vendor if you&#039;re a good buyer&quot;.. Right, and you know that for a fact do you?<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m done with this shit. Fact remains, aakoven needs to up his game, and until he does he has no right to complain about his 95. People are out of a lot of money because of this guy (I&#039;m glad you received your stuff, but to suggest that everyone that didn&#039;t is not a &quot;good buyer&quot; is not based in any reality other than the fictitious one inside your head), and the important thing is that there are actions he can take to prevent that. If he chooses not to do those actions, its his own fault that his rating suffers. Simple as that.

				Don&#039;t mean to shit on anyone&#039;s parade but my sole interactions with aakoven involve him selling me (and a number of other people) a gram of entirely fake ketamine and denying that its fake when confronted about it.

With the amount of product top sellers go through, I wouldnt expect them to test and try everything, every time they receive a batch. Maybe I am being too easy going and should expect more, but the other option is asking a random guy at a club and knowing the chance of getting something decent is next to none.<br />Happy bday, would love to make some orders but NL-Aust seems a little dodgy at the moment. Hopefully will be around next year to wish you the same.

				In all honesty, if you don&#039;t like the way AAkoven has treated you, go to another vendor, period. Leave your comments, and if there is enough of the same kind of comments, then people will not buy from the vendor.

				Congrats AA! Been a buyer on here almost as long (9 months) and have gotten my MDMA from AA since the beginning. I agree it was way better back then when the community was smaller and people didn&#039;t expect this place to be like Amazon.com with customer service. But AA has come through for me each time, and I respect his dedication. Yes there are are bunch of new sellers here and yes it&#039;s just a website to buy drugs, but to me it feels like a community and I think it&#039;s worth being loyal and giving your money to somebody who seems like a good dude. Hurts me to see his rating creep down recently :&#039;( but again congrats on a year and I hope we can still be doing business when you hit 2 years!

				Im sorry but I have to throw in my 2 on AA. It blows my mind how he is still referred to as a trusted seller. But i guess when you make everyone FE it is pretty easy to slide by on false accomplishments. Please smarten up people!! Putting 5/5 when you finalize early only targets you for SELECTIVE scammers such as AA, and only encourages vendors like this to make it a policy so that they can easily ship out FAKE product and act like they were none the wiser that there product is pure shitttt, and thats if they even ship your order at all.. If it doesnt come arrive, 90% chance they didnt send it at all. And then your trapped in their 50% Refund bullshit. <br /><br />AA is by far the worst vendor I have ever had the misfortune of working with. It doesnt take much searching in the forums to find that AA fails to meet the standards of a Loyal vendor when it comes to PRODUCT, COMMUNICATION, RESOLUTION, or even simple RESPECT. His speed is complete garbage( maybe get 20% actual product if lucky) and his ketamine was a COMPLETE JOKE!! I did my full gram in one night just to see how bullshit it really was, and let me tell you it was pretty clear there was 0% ket in there!!! On top of scamming his costumers by sending them fake product, when confronted with this information he acts like we are high school druggies that wouldnt and couldnt know better. He treats his costumers with blatant disrespect by acting like we are uninformed and dont know anything on the drugs we choose to take. And continues to make an even bigger piece of shit of himself by pretending he doesnt have knowledge of the quality of his own products. <br /><br />If ever confronted on any of this nonsense his english returns to a toddler level and you will have no luck getting a reasonable or respecfull response. He is absolutely spineless and spits in all of your faces with with his deceitful bullshit.<br /><br />BEWARE buyers(especially US) This one is not to be trusted!!
