				Which drug sells the most on the road? I&#039;m talking about sheer quantity of product being sold a week. I have spoken to many vendors and I myself was a vendor a little while ago, and sales for cannabis seem to be the most. I remember selling cocaine I only got rid of 3-4 grams a day and that is the amount some vendors on the best seller lists get rid of also. But when it came to weed, the shit flew out the door.<br />What&#039;s everyone&#039;s opinion on this?<br />The best selling product on the road would be the best product to invest in for selling on the road.

				Weed is over saturated market.&nbsp; Too many sellers&nbsp; can&#039;t get a profit or have to sell cheap.<br /><br />Anything that sells good on the road, is over saturated market and sellers are for forced to drop prices, cut their dope and pull scams towed up the losses.<br /><br />I&#039;m betting something obscure would sell the best, nice and quietly too, so other sellers don&#039;t jump into market and start competing. <br /><br />Ya penicillin is a big seller.&nbsp; Junkies are always getting infected with dirty needles Ha ha. And too embarrassed to go to the hospital?&nbsp; &nbsp;Funny.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also STD&#039;s. need antibiotics and hiding it from the wife isnt easy. Hahjaahan

				Cocaine and heroin are marked up, but they don&#039;t sell as much as you&#039;d think. Just ask the big sellers on here. They aren&#039;t selling kilos everyday like everyone would like to think.<br /><br />I do notice how lsd does really well so Id say its a tie between lsd and cannabis for a single vendor selling a certain quantity of a product every week. <br />I never sold mdma and I don&#039;t really know anything about it in terms of sale on SR.

				Im no vendor, but i think its safe to day, that aside from marijuana, itd have to be LSD, MDMA, Meth and opiates. Just from the forums, thats what&nbsp; ive gathered. <br /><br />The only reason that blow isnt the best seller all around, I think, is because of the price to quality ratio. Ive never made a cocaine purchase off SR, but idc how &#039;good&#039; or &#039;pure&#039; the white is, no cocaine is worth more than $80g. Just my opinion.

Meth tho man, I&#039;d like to know on a survey of some sort with the vendors how much of their product goes to the east coast USA, meth seems to be nowhere up here, it was my first purchase on the road since I hadn&#039;t done it since I came up here. SR is prob a very good place to get meth as far as price and safety goes no doubt

I am happy I quit the habit long before ever coming to the SR.&nbsp; In no way am I blaming SR for exacerbating any user&#039;s habits but I can certainly imagine opiates being the #1 seller on here, especially considering the prices aren&#039;t much lower (if at all) than the street prices that I used to see.<br /><br />Weed, opiates, MDMA in that order is my personal guess.&nbsp; I guess it depends if we are measuring by weight, typical dosage, or $ (which I think makes the most sense).&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see some stats on this but I doubt any of the administrators would reveal such information since they have nothing to gain from it.<br /><br />I primarily buy MDMA and whenever I need to I can find dozens of vendors.&nbsp; When old ones disappear there are always new ones coming in to take their place.&nbsp; Heck as an American my only practical choice at first on SR was to buy from Europe (US, Canadian, and UK MDMA was too expensive) and I have already seen a very large drop in Canadian MDMA.&nbsp; Just hoping that US MDMA drops within the next half year or so (I believe it will and boy will it help make me a shit ton of $ as a re-seller).<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t know why anyone would even sell weed on here, especially considering weed takes up so much more space (ie more packaging) and has a more difficult smell to control.&nbsp; Add the super-saturation of the market and it just wouldn&#039;t be my type of thing.&nbsp; Heck I believe you can actually sell weed legally in some states in the US as long as you have a license.<br /><br />Just my .02.&nbsp; If I knew how to get my hands on a regular 80mg Oxycontin prescription I would be set for life LOL

				Opiates. Weed is a big seller if you&#039;re considering sheer mass of trade, but with regard to what sells the most with dose equivalency w/o tolerance for easy measuere (IE: 0.5g weed = 200mg MDMA = 50mg meth = 3.5g shrooms = 20mg heroin), I would say weed has the most sellers, simply because it&#039;s generally the easiest to get a solid supply of, so the market gets flooded with many weed dealers with relatively low sales for most.<br /><br />I think that opiates are the biggest seller here, dose for dose, and monetarily. Tolerance builds quick, addiction potential is high, and illicit purchase for legitimate medical use is prevalent. I smoke weed but over a year here and I have not yet bought a leaf of the green. It&#039;s easy to get local, and sadly the hardest product to stealth ship. MDMA is adulterated in many places making it a huge seller here, and the same goes for cocaine. Cocaine could earn a few points here because of its addiction potential, which increases sale frequency.<br /><br />I firmly believe that opiates take the cake by a long shot here on SR. Even though there are many that join SR for the far less addicting psychedelic substances, the narcotics are bought in higher frequency, higher doses to accomodate tolerance, and also for their use as medicine (IE meth for ADHD, focus, heroin/opioids for pain, and all for recreation).<br /><br />I haven&#039;t analyzed coke sales much but I have noticed an explosion in Canadian distribution over the last 2 months. Some hard data on this would be very cool to see!

				My guess is Mdma...Out of all the items listed Mdma is the hardest for me to find IRL.You can find it ,but 99% of the time its not real.Even harder for me to find than Lsd..There&#039;s such a variety of it,and the drought we have had in (US) for so long...But were just one country....just a guess..

				I&#039;m sure half the people selling weed that are growers or get it from the source sell it on here because otherwise they&#039;d be holding on to the product 10x longer. Also you could take all your bad batches and rid em on here lol and put the good out on the streets

				In my opinion, by far, weed. Plethora of vendors, plethora of customers, and it&#039;s widely accepted.<br /><br />Next, is opiates. Their addictive nature and scarcity. End of story.<br /><br />Last, MDMA. When you know that an entire country has a sh!tty product overall, and an entity (we won&#039;t say who) has the ability to connect you with top quality, it&#039;s going to be a huge seller.<br /><br />This sh!t can make you a rock star in Anytown, USA!
