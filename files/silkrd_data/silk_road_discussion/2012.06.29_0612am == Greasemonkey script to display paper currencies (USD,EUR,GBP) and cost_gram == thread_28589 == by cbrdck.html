				Hi guys,<br /><br />I thought it would be useful to see the prices in real-world currencies as well as BTC. I started doing just that and from there it kinda got out of control a bit.<br /><br />So I give you my greasemonkey script:<br />* Gets the exchange rates from intersango.com<br />* Adds paper currency column next to BTC price column on category listings.<br />* * Switch between GBP, EUR and USD by clicking the header link (&quot;&lt;-&gt;&quot;)<br />* Adds another column with &lt;currency&gt;/gram cost. This is picked up from title and may not always work, so do not trust implicitly.<br />* The above are also displayed in item detail and cart page<br />* In the rest of the pages (home, user, ?), it just adds paper currency next to any BTC values<br />* Saves the exchange rates and your currency preference in a cookie<br />* Adds info (active currency, exchange rate) &amp; links (change currency, refresh exchange rate) to bottom of all pages<br /><br />Maybe someone else will also find this useful. If you have GreaseMonkey installed, get the script from here:<br /><br />http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/137270<br /><br />In case you missed it above, **THIS SCRIPT CREATES A COOKIE TO STORE THE CURRENT EXCHANGE RATE AND YOUR PREFERRED CURRENCY** <br /><br />I also posted this in off topic, not sure if it should be here or there.<br /><br />edit: If the install button doesn&#039;t work for you, right click the install button, click View User Script Source, and you should see a yellow bar with an install button. Alternatively, save to somewhere and load manually.<br /><br />* It goes without saying, don&#039;t visit unless over Tor. Kind of a dead giveaway.

				Hi Boris, Vendettent,<br /><br />I covered this in the other thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28478.0<br /><br />The possibility of a virus doesn&#039;t really exist, as this is not a binary file, but pure javascript source code.<br /><br />If someone who knows a bit of JS can take a deep breath (very messy - it just happened) and go through it, I am sure they will tell you the same.<br /><br />&#039;duck.<br /><br />EDIT: I don&#039;t mean it isn&#039;t possible to do malicious stuff in JS, not at all! I am saying it is impossible to hide it and anyone can see if there is maliciousness or not.

				For anyone wondering the code is safe and clean, this is a good add-on.<br /><br />It&#039;s certainly not the most efficient code I&#039;ve ever seen however!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />OZ

There&#039;s no leakage from the code the guy provided, other than possibly at the Intersango end, although if you&#039;re running through Tor you&#039;re fine. Intersango are just going to start wondering why they&#039;re getting loads of API requests through Tor, although that isn&#039;t too unusual given the nature of their business.

				I&#039;m a huge nerd when it comes to browser extensions etc but I&#039;ll err on the side of caution for this one. <br /><br />Cool idea though.

				This add-on is fucking brilliant!!! I highly recommend. Been using it for a week or so now, and it&#039;s greatly improved my Silk Road experience.<br />Could one of the mods maybe pin this thread to the top of the board please, maybe in the Feature Requests forum. If that&#039;s an OK thing to do. I think many users would be grateful to be able to use this add-on. :)
