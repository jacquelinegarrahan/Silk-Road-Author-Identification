				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to maybe become a seller on here as I have a contact that sells me great quality MDMA at a good price. I&#039;ve been looking around and it&#039;s very hard to find information on the following:<br /><br />1) How much does a seller account cost? It seems like this should be displayed on the &#039;become a seller&#039; page but it&#039;s not. It&#039;s not in the seller guide either. <br /><br />2) How much goes it cost a seller to list an item? For example if I wanted to sell 1g of MDMA for $55 what kind of fees would be incurred? <br /><br />3) Do buyers also get charged a fee? If I&#039;m listing at $55 then how much are they actually going to pay for it from SR?<br /><br />It&#039;s all a bit confusing and makes working out profit margins, RoI, etc very hard. <br /><br />I&#039;ll appreciate any comments or links to where I can find that information.<br /><br />Thank you,

				Ok, I think I&#039;ve got this.. <br /><br />So if I want to get $55 cleared from a transaction then:<br /><br />$55 + 4% escrow fee + 10% on first $50, 8.5% on last $5... <br /><br />So the price displayed would be $62.81<br /><br />I think that&#039;s right.. I still don&#039;t know how much a seller account is, though. Research says $150 but that&#039;s all just hearsay.

				It&#039;s a bit absurd really as what am I meant to do? Just load bitcoins onto my account repeatedly until it finally decides I have enough? <br />A very odd way of doing business, imo. <br /><br />Costs should be transparent so all parties know what they&#039;re getting into.

				yes, it&#039;s quite funny how in the &quot;seller guide&quot; there is no mention of fees to become one..<br /><br />I understand that a seller could be potentially more dangerous than a buyer for the community users, but both LEOs and scammers have no problems in throwing in some bucks to reach their goal.<br /><br />I&#039;m totally fine with the fact that who built this marketplace is earning a share on buyers, but some trasparency would make things much more clear..

				It&#039;s $150 for a seller account. At a $55 item you would have 10% tacked on for SR commission. Buyers don&#039;t have a fee.

				I too have been contemplating becoming a seller once all this shit with disappearing coins gets straightened out. I know I need $150 dollars to open the account, but where is it listed what the commission fees are, and how they work?

				But there&#039;s also a 4% undocumented escrow fee as well, isn&#039;t there? When is this applied? <br />Is it applied to price + fees or just price?<br /><br />A simple sticky explaining everything wouldn&#039;t be so hard..

				the 4% would come off of what you receive at the end of the transaction and i think no fee&#039;s are aplied to the amount you set for postage.<br />a seller can set it up so either SR fee is taken off of their price or so that it is applied to what the buyer pays.<br />You want $55 after commission does this include your postage cost?,so you would add 4% for escrow hedging and then set it so the commission is applied to the buyer and not you .<br />Because your item is listed for $55+4% then your item would fall under the 8.5% commission so your buyers would be paying&nbsp; $55+4% + 8.5% + postage if you set it.<br />hope this helps

				also take into consideration any fee&#039;s you might incur when cashing out your BTC, not sure if you have already done this to achieve your $55 asking price?

				I&#039;m having this same question, I&#039;d really like to become a vendor but its all just hearsay from what i can tell as far as the cost. Some say 150, others 180, and 250 seems wrong. Who am i to say though? can we please get a sticky on this? or possibly have a mod comment on this post so we know. Thank you! I&#039;m sorry this is such a newbie question.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />TIP

				It&#039;s 150.<br />Now when you click on &quot;become a seller&quot; it even tells you the exact amount in BTCs.<br />
