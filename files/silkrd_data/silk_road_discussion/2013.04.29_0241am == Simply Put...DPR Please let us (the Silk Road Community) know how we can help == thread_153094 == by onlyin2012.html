				Collectively as a legion of resources and users, I don&#039;t think people, users or sellers as a whole will mind if you have any suggestions or would like technical feedback.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sure there wil always be someone that complains but it&#039;s impossible to make everyone happy, business 101.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you think it would be best that we compile a list of items that we can all do to help, please, by all means, let us know.&nbsp; There are thousands of people that are faithful to SR and are not stupid enough or would knee-jerk and run off to other sites that may very well be behind these various attacks, I would say that thousands of SR users would like to see SR up and running and purring along.&nbsp; Sure, we might have to make a few sacrifices but fuck... we all need to pull together at this point and help out as one big community.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that you also have a vast source of technical members in the community that could help out if you want to post up a suggestion box.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe a note on the logon page saying that SR is being targeted by some A-Holes that seem to have the upper hand and it will be a couple of days before things return to normal, until then please do not logon, and give yourself an ample window of time.&nbsp; Or if you have a specifical address where technical people can submit suggestions, that might help out?&nbsp; Sure maybe a few people will jump ship, but in the long run I think people of the SR community will recognize how great of thing we have going here and sometimes we just need to support and make sacrifices in order to get over large hurdles.&nbsp; Some attacks are complicated and take days to resolve, especially more modern sophisticated attacks.&nbsp; You also don&#039;t want to be distracted trying to resolve these attacks while the bastard(s) that are creating this problem are up to something else so, watch you backs and if you need to shut the site down and put up a banner page with the status of SR, so be it.&nbsp; Some people will just have to figure out how to get by for a few days.&nbsp; This just is what it is and sure it hurts us all a little as buyers and sellers but in the long run, we&#039;ll be better for it if we can all collectively help.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please feel free to lead the way!&nbsp; If need be, I&#039;ll just take an unfortunate break from SR for a few days, whatever it takes to help SR get a solid solution in place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please lead the the way DPR with whatever suggestions you have for the SR community and I think we&#039;ll all be able to pull together and help you / us get over this hurdle.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a member now going on almost 18 months and there&#039;s no way I&#039;m jumping ship to another site, Im behind you 100% DPR !<br /><br />Press on SR!&nbsp;

				Just wanted to hop on here and say I&#039;m here for anything too!<br />Not sure if there is anything we could do, but I&#039;d like to throw myself out there. I am seriously dedicated to this community with all my heart so please let me me know.<br /><br />I hope for the best and lets hope this attack rolls away.<br />Long live SR. Peace &amp; Love to you all.<br /><br /><br />and hey DPR...remember, if you ever need an army you sure as hell got one.

				Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, didn&#039;t do it alone. As he said himself: Many eyes make all bugs shallow. So it&#039;s just a matter of herding us geeks about until we <br />come up with a solution. All you need to do DPR, is ask the right kinds of questions (no server logs pls :) ) and an army of volunteers will set to work.

				Simply put.<br /><br />The best ways to support SR is by letting them figure out/deal with the problem at hand and when the time comes and SR is back up and running. Is for us to buy some products on the site, as SR gets some money from every order. which helps them to deal with problems like this.<br /><br />Pretty easy.<br />And you get something in return.

				This is an awesome post. Yes DPR, let us know.. I&#039;m at your service. I posted in another thread but.. like I&#039;ve said. If you can pinpoint where the attacks are coming from, let us know. I have offered to put forth my personal btc to pay for the services of anyone skilled enough to retaliate on a level that will fuck their world up something fierce.

				There is no silk road community.<br /><br />The real people behind SR are all a bunch of drug lords and arms traffickers.<br /><br />The rest of you are all a bunch of pussies who barely order anything if at all.<br /><br />Quit trying to be little Christian bitches and show &quot;the community&quot; support. We don&#039;t fucking need it.<br /><br />Silk Road will be back soon enough and if not there are a thousand other places you can get drugs on the dark and clear net.<br /><br />All of you looking for attention and respect by offering a helping hand to mitigate the ddos are begging for trouble.<br /><br />As I have been saying since I joined this motherfucking forums get with the goddamn program.<br /><br />And we mean it.

				Where are all the arms?&nbsp; Or legs for that matter..&nbsp; I just don&#039;t see any guns..&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the admins would be making commissions and not selling drugs like petty dealers.&nbsp; Drug lords?&nbsp; Doubt it.&nbsp; <br />Commission and libertarian lords?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Read DPR s msuggested reading.&nbsp; He&#039;s a libertarian and hats what the site really about.&nbsp; Guns are not even mentioned here and there are no cartels as everyone is equal here.&nbsp; It just comes down to your contacts and ability to pack things for shipping.
