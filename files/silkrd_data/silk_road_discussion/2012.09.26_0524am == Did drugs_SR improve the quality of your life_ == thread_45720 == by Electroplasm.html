				Did drugs/SR improve the quality of your life?<br /><br />I just wanted to express my infinite gratitude to those who have chosen to be a part of this movement. I know drugs are nothing to hide behind, but I feel like my life genuinely improved. I used to be very lonely and depressed. I purchased LSD from Mitanox last year and had several life changing experiences. I was inspired to actually go out and meet people, and that&#039;s when life started getting better. When I gave life a chance. When I took the first step to break out of my shell, a cycle, a reoccurring thought which had become my reality. Since then I&#039;ve shared wonderful substances with my friends and saw them break through issues they had, as well as simple things like actually going out to dance and have fun without any expectations. It&#039;s so strange how me and some of my friends used to think dancing was &quot;lame&quot;, mainly cause we didn&#039;t have the confidence and had huge egos and thought everybody would judge us. The truth is everyone is out to have a good time, so enjoy life, do drugs sometimes, and step out of your comfort zone. Great things are outside for the taking. <br /><br />I would love to hear your story. You are a wonderful being full of potential.<br /><br />I love you.

				Definitely yes.<br /><br />Psychedelics made my perception of reality much richer and brighter.&nbsp; I just have better awareness of life and current state of our society.<br /><br />Also using some drugs to combat my other issues when needed.<br /><br />You still have to be smart about it though.&nbsp; Some drugs are better left alone.

				Yes.<br /><br />I have just barely started my life story, so not much to write about. But I&#039;m pretty sure it will be a long and intense (and still very enjoyable) one. I hope to return to SR after many years, and be able to tell my own life-changing, positive story )<br /><br />I think nbomes are a good example of a drug to be cautious with - take what it has to offer (a few times for me :) ), learn from it and leave it alone

				It&#039;s very slightly given me some positive additions to my life, but I&#039;m fairly certain without drugs my life would still be good.&nbsp; I despise alcohol, mostly.&nbsp; The price, the feeling it leaves in you, it&#039;s just disgusting and poisonous feeling.&nbsp; <br /><br />MDMA taught me how to come out of my shell a bit, I don&#039;t roll a lot but it&#039;s funner (and cheaper!) than drinking all night.&nbsp; With much more positive feelings all around.&nbsp; <br /><br />LSD has become a wonderful bonding tool with friends, and a great self-therapy tool when tripping solo.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t understand why this drug has such a negative stigma.&nbsp; It&#039;s never brought anything but positivity and betterment to my lifetime and my acquaintances.&nbsp; To boot, 2-3 hits runs half the price of a night of barhopping and lasts 3-4 times as long.

				Psychedelics improved my quality yeah, I recommend them to anyone.&nbsp; I smoke a lot of weed but that&#039;s neither good/bad (probably good if I didn&#039;t smoke so much of it).&nbsp; I don&#039;t mess with opiates or meth/speed, seen too many screwups wreck themselves on that stuff.&nbsp;

				MDMA has most definitely changed my life for the better. So has using psychedelic drugs. I hate alcohol and refuse to ever drink, I much prefer the aforementioned drugs because they actually make real, positive changes in you, alcohol is just destructive and fake.

				Yes, it has improved my life greatly.&nbsp; Had a 25c trip that caused me to &#039;see&#039; things about my life that I hadn&#039;t recognized.&nbsp; I have since made changes that have resulted in vast improvement of my physical heath.&nbsp; Would not have happened without SR.&nbsp; I&#039;d say SR has changed my life for the better.&nbsp; However, I recognize that there are those who will have had very bad experiences and even suffered addiction as a result of the drugs they buy here.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not all peaches and cream.&nbsp; But it is my opinion that these people suffer at their own hands and not at those of SR or any vendor.&nbsp; Freedom and personal responsibility go hand in hand.&nbsp; But I digress...

				Definitely! I found out by pure chance as well... I have experienced the most amazing summer thanks to SR. I would never be able to get the things I got from here in real life if it wasn&#039;t for SR. The MDMA around here was quite shit, the pills were even worse, the weed was always below average.<br /><br />SR gave me the opportunity to bond with friends even more, to experience things I never thought possible.<br /><br />THANK YOU SR!

				Certainly psychedelics have completely changed my life, i believe for the better. My most profound experience was probably from eating 5meo-dmt after using an maoi absolutely unbelievable. Before ever experimenting with drugs I was very much a set in stone atheist. I may still not know exactly what God is, but it&#039;s very exciting to explore and learn. My spirituality went from zero to 60.

				The main thing the road has taught me is how much damage i was doing to my brain smoking soapbar.<br />the access to the amazing selection of weed on the road is a pure delight.<br />I remember the days of chewing my fingers off, dying for a smoke and almost feeling grateful when getting some soap -<br />but not getting stoned - more like settling into a paranoia that it brought out in me.<br />My friends, and even myself, were starting to say I had a problem.<br />Now i am on a mission to try every strain of weed there is haha - and to smoke such fine weed, no paranoia, no stress when i dont have any,<br />it really is great -&nbsp; fuck knows what i put into my body smoking soap - never again!<br /><br />Peace

				I am a regular smoker and had my experiences with cocaine, the good the bad and the ugly.<br /><br />I can tell you that smoking weed is&nbsp; a good thing to do sometimes, same with alcohol or anything really.<br /><br />Class A drugs always have to be handled with extra care ( good setting good mood etc).<br /><br />I can say that i tried shrooms 4 times throughout my life, and each time after I had new ideas for business, or cut off certain people who when I was looking at the big picture, where not needed in my life.<br /><br />Enjoy&amp; be safe&nbsp; ::)

				Well my first orders are still in transit but I&#039;ve caught myself skipping at times while perambulating.&nbsp; The Silk Road has added an important new freedom and dimension to my life.&nbsp; I am old enough to understand the value and appreciate the nature of this gift.&nbsp; With a little bit of self control (which I do have) I prophesy the Silk Road definitely adding to the quality of my life.

				Without the slightest hint of a doubt. Silk Road has enriched my life.<br />In my location IRL the drugs are SO SHITTY, SO DANGEROUS, SO EXPENSIVE AND SO SCARCE.<br />I&#039;m outgoing, yet introverted, so I was absolutely fascinated with psychedelics, but for the life of me, there&#039;s NOT A CHANCE I could find any reliable LSD that I could depend on.<br /><br />People in real life don&#039;t have a clue what the hell &quot;2cb&quot; is, or any other of the specialty drugs on here for that matter.&nbsp; I found it incredibly difficult to source real MDMA, when I eventually did I paid $700 for two grams.&nbsp; When I found SR in Jan/Feb, I was just blown away, I couldn&#039;t believe it!&nbsp; I also wished that I had of kept my tax return for another couple of months, i&#039;d have 10 grams of MDMA instead of 2.<br /><br />Since trying some of the amazing drugs on here I&#039;ve had major breakthrough experiences on psychedelics of the most positive kind, one terrifying scare (it&#039;s all experience I guess) and lots of bonding time with my friends.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to pinch myself.&nbsp; I mean really, Silk Road is just amazing. <br /><br />Highlights:&nbsp; these are the people that are directly responsible for enriching my life, and giving me experiences I will NEVER forget....<br /><br />Ivory and his amazing 2cb<br />Duderugs (unfortunately fell on some hard times IRL) and his 25i<br />3jane and her MDA<br /><br /><br /><br />

				chronic pain and the new prohibition on opiate pain meds had me srsly considering suicide. I did not want to live without any relief ever.&nbsp; Now i know that i can get a little extra in case and not have to deal with the depression, sickness, constant ache and loss of function due to debility. I am able to do more for myself , and not just lay there when i have a bad day. I&#039;m less of a bitch too so maybe I will have a friend and be able to go out sometime. Prices ARE exorbitant in this area...but i guess that keeps me from getting a tolerance. ;)&nbsp; But, its $ to go to doctors w/o health care and often get nothing, except treated like an addict, or they think you can afford a bunch of expensive tests and surgeries.. So Thank you.
