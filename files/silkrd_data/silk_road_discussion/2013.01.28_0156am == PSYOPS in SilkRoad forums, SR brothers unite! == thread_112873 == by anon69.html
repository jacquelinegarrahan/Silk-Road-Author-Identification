				Update:<br />I&#039;ve remembered that i warned this community of the possible dangers of PSYOPS in forums before and due to the recent turn of events I&#039;ve bumped this thread, i hope you be specially careful at these times while the dust clears off.<br /><br />Please take the time to inform yourself you may thank me later.<br />Stay safe<br />Anon<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />Hi there I&#039;ve seen PSYOPS being taken place in IRC&#039;s and forums where certain forums were taken to an incredible lack of activity, irc&#039;s witch hunting the next fed that came around when they were just attacking each other, I never found anything here on SilkRoad though maybe I missed something since I&#039;m still new to this forum, but I would love to hear what you guys had to say about this and how should we protect our own? If there are any actual proof on the forums of such activity please post.<br />I know that this type of techniques will likely be used since we are dealing with heavy gear from all over the world, they are probably copying all the data here, data breaches,doxing, etc.<br />What&#039;s your opinion or anything related to this topic.<br /><br /><br />Also if you are still wondering what psyops are :<br />Psychological Operations (PSYOP, PSYOPS) are techniques used to influence a target audience&#039;s emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and behavior. The target audience is usually the userbase of a target website, and PsyOps are used in order to induce confessions, or reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to the objectives at hand. These are sometimes combined with black operations. <br />from good old https://encyclopediadramatica.se/PsyOps<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare<br />&nbsp;<div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">A good copypasta from ED<br />Bootcamp Version<br />For Newfags<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [1] DisInformation (False sources)<br />http://anonym.to/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [2] Scapegoat (blame it on someone else)<br />http://anonym.to/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoating<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [3] Proof by assertion (they love dis)<br />http://anonym.to/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_assertion<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [4] Appeal to emotion (basic foundations for psyops)<br />http://anonym.to/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [5] Misrepresenting a position<br />http://anonym.to/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [6] Pick your wordz wisely <br />http://anonym.to/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glittering_generalities<br /><br />Also familiarize yourself with these methods and their consequences:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [7] Black Propaganda<br />http://anonym.to/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_propaganda<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [8] Grey Propaganda<br />http://anonym.to/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_propaganda<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [9] White Propaganda (Do it for the lulz) <br />http://anonym.to/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_propaganda<br /><br />For pros<br /><br />These are much longer and more difficult to understand.

This makes it much harder to disprove, and if the subject decides to research on their own, they will find the truth then see your argument as credible. If they find anything disproving, also this adds reasoning that the person, merely miscommunicated rather than lie directly to the target. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; People generally will generally convince themselves when it comes to falsehoods, the best thing to do is provide the groundwork and let their minds work against them. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Details are the absolute most important thing there is. Several small things are infinitely more likely to pass you off as a true member of the community than a huge red fucking banner on your myspace proclaiming &#039;I HEART YIFF&#039; or whatever applies. Once again, people generally convince themselves far more effectively than anyone else ever could. All you have to do is lay the path and put the rose petals down. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; At the same time, too much detail is a bad thing. If a new user demonstrates encyclopaedic knowledge of the target community, people will become suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you need a guide on how to troll through arguments, and need more help on the argument itself, see Forum Trolling. </code>

				I think you bring up a fair and valid concern - however - <br /><br />Manipulating the silk road community as a whole will be incredibly difficult for several reasons - we don&#039;t all read the same posts and take part in the same discussions - those of us who have been buying or selling for any amount of time on the road have learned to be very cautious, considering every piece of information we post as immediately being seen by LE and others. <br /><br />The most weight is given to established members, who contribute far too much to be LE or corrupted in a way you describe. No LE would become a prolific, and (in)famous vendor, (already a challenging task, requiring one to commit professional amounts of time and labor to their trade), just to try some psyops on the forums; we have enough trolls and noobs that we generally ignore information not relevant to our immediate dealings, or at the very least, we will read but not act on or reply to it.<br /><br />And in terms of individual communications, PM&#039;s and addresses and such, we become especially cautious about revealing information about ourselves.<br /><br />In short, the strategies you describe are possible, but the nature of the silk road will render them largely ineffective at forwarding LE&#039;s goals. The worst they might do is raise a stink claiming some vendor or another scammed them, to try to discredit or destabilize the community.

Trolls and noobs are not even in comparison to PSYOPS i mean some trolls are very nice and elaborate but not this new age shit &quot;lolumad brah&quot; &quot;lol i trolled u&quot;.<br /><br />Pm&#039;s i must agree it&#039;s a very potential weapon in spying,spreading chaos and confusion and all sorts of things.<br /><br />And matrix men I&#039;m not just mentioning LE I&#039;m talking FBI,Local Police,Costums, you name it they are in here for sure.We are totally not being watch we aren&#039;t like one the biggest illegal drugs trading platforms on the darkwebz :)

				I use LE as a blanket term for those who would work against us - agencies and otherwise.<br /><br />Yes - we should be concerned about manipulation from outside forces, of a of more insidious nature than just disrupting our trade and sniping a few packages.<br />&nbsp;Pysops may catch a careless individual, but if they&#039;re careless, they&#039;re already at risk.<br />I&#039;d say the lesson to take away is, be careful, be cautious, and know that it all comes with a risk.

				I see I thought otherwise, and yes we should be careful constantly the risk of getting busted is always imminent sorry for the paranoia i might create but we need to get more people aware of these tactics at least if many people read and are aware of this we might prevent some busts in the future.

				Hard to say, but I have read a lot of dumb &quot;scary&quot; shit from people without any history that never came back around.&nbsp; A lot pertaining to getting bitcoins or sensational paranoia about getting things in the mail.&nbsp; All things I&#039;ve never experienced or worried about the least bit.&nbsp; That said, coupled with not knowing the demographic here, I sometimes wonder if it isn&#039;t just someone so far gone (like crazy paranoid junkie type) they&#039;re actually serious.&nbsp; Either way I&#039;m not worried about it.

				Without free exchange of information no matter how big or small this place can not grow in a healthy path.<br />Withholding information is a natural way to create problems.<br />Many members have come and gone and they have all left from the result of this exact issue.<br />Look at some of the vendors from last year and how successful they were yet they left because of a lack of information to ease their concerns.<br />Almost every vendor to reach the top 1% of vendors have now left.<br />Look it up it&#039;s in black and white.

				Seen on bluelight forums, relevant to the thread: Not sure how &#039;real&#039; it is, but the information and strategies described are rational:<br /><br />COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum..<br /><br />There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a &#039;uncontrolled forum.&#039;<br /><br />Technique #1 - &#039;FORUM SLIDING&#039;<br /><br />If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by &#039;forum sliding.&#039; In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to &#039;age.&#039; Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a &#039;forum slide.&#039; The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a &#039;forum slide&#039; and &#039;flush&#039; the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then &#039;replying&#039; to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting &#039;slides&#039; down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.<br /><br />Technique #2 - &#039;CONSENSUS CRACKING&#039;<br /><br />A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at www.abovetopsecret.com) is &#039;consensus cracking.&#039; To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger &#039;evidence&#039; or disinformation in your favour is slowly &#039;seeded in.&#039; Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then &#039;abort&#039; the consensus cracking by initiating a &#039;forum slide.&#039;<br /><br />Technique #3 - &#039;TOPIC DILUTION&#039;<br /><br />Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a &#039;RESOURCE BURN.&#039; By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a &#039;gossip mode.&#039; In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to &#039;drive in the wedge.&#039; By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.<br /><br />Technique #4 - &#039;INFORMATION COLLECTION&#039;<br /><br />Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a &#039;show you mine so me yours&#039; posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your &#039;favourite weapon&#039; and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite &#039;technique of operation.&#039; From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.<br /><br />Technique #5 - &#039;ANGER TROLLING&#039;<br /><br />Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to &#039;stage&#039; a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to &#039;lead&#039; the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you &#039;do not care what the authorities think!!&#039; inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution.<br /><br />Technique #6 - &#039;GAINING FULL CONTROL&#039;<br /><br />It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the &#039;ultimate victory&#039; as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a &#039;honey pot&#039; gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.

Everyone must be aware of theses tactics before you are next, protect yourselves with knowledge and encryption!<br /><br />###################################################################################################<br /><br />
