				I&#039;m just about to buy a second account so I can separate my lottery listings&nbsp; which I want to peg in BTC and my other listings which I want to keep in $$<br />Only way I can do this is by opening two accounts and I&#039;m just about to conclude a deal to buy a used account from a retired vendor.<br /><br />There will be some money changing hands and my first idea is for him to setup a listing and I buy his account so that way we have resolution center if he doesn&#039;t hand over the keys after the sale.<br />Then I got thinking what if that never happens, will resolution center take action? They could always claim I control both accounts now or how could the exchange be proven. <br /><br />Would using a trusted forum member or Mod be a better idea but who can you trust....Trust nobody!! That&#039;s always been my motto but now it&#039;s backfiring xD <br /><br />PGP signiture on profile page to prove who is who? Or am I just way over-thinking this?<br />It&#039;s just I don&#039;t know would resolution center even care to take on such a case.<br /><br />Anyway thought&#039;s ideas would be welcome

				My first thought is that anyone who sells lotteries can&#039;t be trusted. They are usually used to take advantage of people. So, if you did have the deal in escrow and tried to use resolution, I would think the resolution might not go well for you. Buying an account to get fake credibility would also suggest a possible unsavory intent and unreliable word in the resolution. Those are my first &quot;thought&#039;s ideas&quot;. If your not one of the scumbags who are buying accounts to fool noobs into giving away their Btc, sorry for lumping you in with them. Lotteries and begging seem harmful to SR and annoy me regularly.
