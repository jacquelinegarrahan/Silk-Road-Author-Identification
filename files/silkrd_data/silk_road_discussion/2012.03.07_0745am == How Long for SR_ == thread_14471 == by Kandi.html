				I love SR but each time I come here I&#039;m always wondering if it will still be up. <br />I know those articles about this site probably made LE even more determined to stop this site (I mean look what they&#039;ve been doing to torrent sites, and they are nothing compared to what this place offers) so they must be working on it.<br /><br /><br />How come they havent done anything so far? Is it too difficult to take this place or are they not as interested?<br /><br /><br />I was actually surprised when I realized how long its been here so far &amp; really hope it stays but if it doesnt, will somewhere else pop up thats like this place and how could we find it? I only found this place because of the articles on web.<br /><br /><br />Do you think SR has some decent life left in it to survive another year or so?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				We can hope.. The popular vernacular of &#039;All good things come to an end&#039; comes to mind, the hope is that if it ceases in its present form its to become something even greater, to evolve. <br /><br />We&#039;ve taken back a part of our freedom, we can openly trade in things that make us happy. I don&#039;t think They like that, maybe they even want to nip in the bud... It doesn&#039;t matter, at least not for the customers, because something will take its place all hydra like. <br /><br />Decentralised SR? Could happen... <br /><br />Branched out to i2p? <br /><br />Freenet? <br /><br />All possible. There&#039;ll be something, even if SR doesn&#039;t remain. For now enjoy it, make some friends or at least contacts, trade stories, get high and when the music stop....

				the fact that SR is run off (at least) one physical server, and is a tor-based hidden server gives it a step up against torrent sites imo. tho i&#039;d still be curious to know the exact figures of the combined budget of the music industry/torrent sites vs the feds/SR...<br /><br />i $upport the music industry all the time, well the electronic vinyl scene mostly...tho i still love pirate bay...i do my best.. ;)<br /><br />One can only hope and imagine that DPR and all those behind the site have multiple back-up plans for such scenarios...

				I think the main reason the police and government haven&#039;t done anything is because they can&#039;t. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re both here on the forums and on SR checking out what&#039;s going on and trying to figure out how to stop it, but since it&#039;s not centralized (at least not physically with a distribution center) their hands are tied.<br /><br />They&#039;re probably watching with some curiosity about how such a system could have been created in the first place. They might even be using SR, if they&#039;re smart, as a template for creating their own type of system.<br /><br />And although drugs and their distribution is a concern for the police, I think it takes second place to child porn, whistle-blowing and money laundering.<br /><br />The reason torrent sites are targeted is because the studios and labels, along with their anti-piracy groups, have convinced the governments, especially the US&#039;s, that it&#039;s of national concern. Along with the fact that torrent sites are easy targets.

				Here&#039;s what you do just in case;<br /><br />Order a bit more of whatever you normally buy just in case SR goes dark. Why? You don&#039;t want to have to go through cold turkey withdrawals. <br /><br />Also, many vendors have alternate means of contact in the event SR is down. Make note of it.

				I love SR, and it sure as hell beats looking for stuff on the streets.<br /><br />The thing that gots me worried is a scenario like some rich kid with access to a lot of money buys stuff on SR with no real education or knowledge behind his drugs, he O.D.s, dies, and his parents or friends somehow discover he got his drugs through SR. Then that dead rich kid ends up being a relative of some high ranking government(any government) official, multinational LEO agency or well known media reporter. Someone with lots of public influence, and bang the heat is on majorly. Heaven help if some well known celebrity ever buys from SR and ends up dead O.D.ing. LOL. But they could probably get better access to stuff without dealing with the internet, heh.<br /><br />Yeah its good advice to stock up in case it ever goes down for good. But if SR ends up online going for like years without ending, man... I think they would make a movie about it some day, like a mix between the facebook movie, the social network and the movie Blow where johnny depp plays drug smuggler George Jung (Hope DPR don&#039;t end up like poor George&nbsp; LOL). Years from now we could look back and say yeah that&#039;s when we first started buying illegal drugs on the internet in a major way, when the revolution started.

				You can easily bet there will always be a market like this from now on.&nbsp; There are plenty of people who can and would put forth the effort to open clones of SR if it closes.&nbsp; The concept has been introduced, and so has the prototype.&nbsp; Its only upgrades from here on out.&nbsp;

				With all the money the SR owners are making, I&#039;m sure a similar site would spring up quickly. But I dont like to even think of it. The guys running SR have done the world an amazing justice, and if they got busted, not only would we be out a marketplace, but the owners would surely never see freedom for the rest of their young lives.<br />

I had mtgox freeze my account the first time I used the service until I verified and it was an awful first experience but as I searched the web I noticed it was becoming extremely common and they were freezing A LOT of accounts and a lot of people were very upset.<br /><br /><br />it would be great if btc got more&nbsp; popular but I cant see the government being happy about something they cant control. They don&#039;t like that. lol<br /><br /><br /><br />

If you eliminate the dead bodies, be careful, and you can do what you want.<br /><br />Just a minor correction, &quot;100m tons of cocaine seized from horrible violent black people&quot;, has never and will never be a headline. Your LARGEST bust always happen with individuals that own, planes, boats, or submarines...and I have not seen a black person from America attached to one yet.<br /><br />But I feel your point, though, I do.

				Some interesting points and just thought i&#039;d add my own 2 cents...<br /><br />Someone said about some rich kid/celebrity etc OD&#039;ing off stuff ordered off SR. If they were going do this they would have already. They don&#039;t need a real case to get things like this into papers and on the news, You do know they lie all the time about people dieing from drug od&#039;s don&#039;t you? Next they&#039;ll be trying say ganja kills, Well, if you can smoke 50,000 spliffs in 30 minutes, my hat goes off to you, I try but i think 4-5 is my best. But i do pack em :P<br /><br />I think the more logical answer is the BTC itself, But the way i see it they can&#039;t take it down can they? If it runs on everyone&#039;s system and has no centralised point so no &#039;main&#039; bit to take out. People can carry on mining if they made it illegal or anything, People can still trade BTC&#039;s as they do on SR for other means of payment and also, BTC exchanges pop up on the dark web. I&#039;d personally use the anonymous dark-web site over all the ones we have now. MT Gox demanding information on you, Intersango going on holiday with the smart card for lloyds TSB, it&#039;s a joke. Why do these companies that supposed to be for a revolution end up bending over for the 1%&#039;s who want it all to themselves and fuck everyone else. <br /><br />I&#039;m truly sick of how this world goes off about democracy and business is a good thing when its just the large corporations/banks controlling the goverment to there ends. &#039;Money&#039; as a concept has pushed human advances quicker than ever before but over time its become what we call &#039;ECONOMY&#039;. WTF, Last time i checked economy is the use of resources and the preservation and renewal off those resources. Something that no country in the world any longer takes into consideration. Banks can print as much money as they want and when they want. At a cost to us of cause but they don&#039;t care about that. The end of the world was predicted for 2012, My prediction is the mass kulling of humans is now on. Why don&#039;t we use gallium arsenide like the military in computers? It&#039;s EMP proof also unlike silicon. Do you think we will ever see graphene in civilian use? I really don&#039;t think we will. It will be used by big corporations and military to keep that 1% safe. US congress/Bankers (wankers)/UK Royal Family and so many more are all sick twisted individuals. A snippet of the queen in the UK, She claims over 1.5 million a year off the tax payers in FARMING SUBSIDES! Last time i checked the queen isnt a farmer, She just owns ALOT of land (Taxpayers money of cause to support a old way of thinking) and has BROUGHT the rights to claim the subsides. It&#039;s sick. This is a minor tap at the iceberg that is the royal family. Kate Middleton is actually a Rothschild and as been planned all along by these fuckers. Her nan married someone named middleton to change the name from rothchild. A little known fact.<br /><br />Sorry for ranting, These sick fuckers really do get under my skin. Back to SR closing....<br /><br />If the worst did happen like someone said, We have ways of communicating behond SR and as with what USED to happen, Companies die and other better ones come along if they don&#039;t evolve. This is what will happen to SR if it does ever die. The problem we have these days is big corp&#039;s buy out any competitors and were stuck with the same shit different &#039;housing&#039; and tech grinds to a halt. As it is now. Silicon is dead. It cant progress anymore. I mean 22nm is a HUGE achievement no doubt but its a costly and pointless exercise. Silcon should not have gone below 40nm ffs. We&#039;ve had a replacement in gallium arsenide for time but they say its expensive to produce. Well if we were making it on a scale as we do silicon, IT WOULDN&#039;T BE THAT EXPENSIVE! and it uses the same tools as silicon. it a direct replacement. That and the fact more money shoulda been poured into graphene a decade ago. O, And the big blue will own graphene tech in the end. Mark my words. They also run councils in the UK that people are unaware of. And make some nice money off the tax payer too.<br /><br />The world is run by sick people, It&#039;s not fair, not that its ever been, but hopefully with BTC and things like this people will stop listening to the brainwashing from schools/TV/Newspapers etc and start thinking for themselves....... wishful thinking i know!<br /><br />

				They can only kill all bitcoin exchangers if bitcoin is outlawed in every single country in the world. That will take some time, even CP is only illegal in part of the world.
