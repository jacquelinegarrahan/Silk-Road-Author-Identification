				Great idea. I have been trying to find high CBD concentrates for a friend&#039;s father, who is terminally ill with brain cancer. Yeah, it&#039;s a felony in my state to do this....How fucked up can it be to give relief to a dieing person? Anyway, thanks Libertas!

				I would call it hybrids. That seems to be a more used term. Never heard someone call them blends.<br /><br />And it should be sort of obvious that those are more or less 50/50s since there are also sections for sativa/indica dominant hybrids.

I&#039;ve renamed the category &#039;Hybrids&#039; to remove any &#039;spice&#039; confusion, and all 50/50 Indica/Sativa strains will go there for now. I will leave the other categories as they are for the time-being; I&#039;m running through each listing manually to determine where it would be best placed but when I&#039;m running through them again I&#039;ll see if we can justify a &#039;pure sativa&#039; and &#039;pure indica&#039; category.<br /><br />Libertas

				The &quot;dominants&quot; are hybrids, so, maybe &quot;balanced hybrid&quot;, &quot;balanced Indica/Sativa&quot;, &quot;Approx. 50/50 Indica/Sativa&quot;, &quot;near 50%Indica/50%Sativa&quot;, &quot;Indica/Sativa non-dominant&quot;, &quot;equal-cross hybrids&quot;, &quot;balanced-cross hybrids&quot;,...

				Now it&#039;s just up to the vendors to get it right.&nbsp; I was browsing through sativas just now and noticed someone had an ounce of og kush under that category.&nbsp; I always thought it was a pretty heavy indica based strain.&nbsp; It was always listed under indica at the dispensary I went to.&nbsp; And it def. felt that way.&nbsp; But when I looked it up I&#039;m finding conflicting information.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess it&#039;s not that important, I&#039;m just wondering if the vendors identify by selecting either sativa or indica themselves or do they select their strain and then the SR software automatically categorizes the strain?&nbsp;

				Automatic categorization would be problematic because, as you noticed, OG Kush, depending on which breeder&#039;s version it is, has different qualities.&nbsp; There are quite a few other strains like that as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other thing is that there are (almost) no strains that are not actually blends.&nbsp; Even a super trippy sativa will usually have at least 10% indica.&nbsp; Now I understand customers are mainly interested in the actual experience of the smoke rather than some rigid classification system so its not a huge point.&nbsp; I only make it to suggest that whatever terms are settled on, they be approached from the customers&#039; viewpoint so that a hybrid or blend is a balanced head/body stone, an indica is a heavy body stone and a sativa is a heady, energizing stone, regardless of what the strain is called or technically classified as.<br /><br />Perhaps the headings could have rollovers that describe the different categories in greater detail?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to add a thanks to Libertas for making this happen, its totally cool ;).

				I agree that pretty much everything is a hybrid unless it&#039;s a land race like Afghani or Thai.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes it&#039;s hard to classify a strain also because some of the high quality weed in my area didn&#039;t come from the breeders in Holland.&nbsp; For example, the &quot;Mean Green&quot; I have right now supposedly came straight from the growers in Hawaii (and was not bred in Holland).&nbsp; My supplier told me it was &quot;a Sativa&quot; but I don&#039;t know if that means 100% sativa or simply sativa-dominant.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also the Northern Lights strain that is one of my regulars is supposedly the Pacific Northwest strain and not from any breeder in Holland.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am told that the NL strains from Holland were bred with something else.
