				I need some pain pills in bulk or a good place to buy them from, i would preferably like Lortab 10/500 but percocet and roxys will do also. If anyone knows a good vendor that is willing to work with me on the price of about 500 to a thousand of them let me know please!<br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Morpheus<br />red or blue pill

				Look around on the main site, there are listings for the quantities you have requested. If not PM the vendors who offer the product and ask if they can do a custom listing.

				I am a reseller. I have a lot of suppliers and I can make profit on bringing them customers. The rates that vendors want here is ridiculous and I can very, very easily fill the price gap and offer better prices than most or all of the sellers here on many different drugs.

				PureO offers bulk. Search SR for them. Or just search SR using search term &quot;percocet&quot; or &quot;hydro&quot; and you see a lot of vendors that sell it. But most don&#039;t do bulk. And if they would do it special for you, they will probably want FE. So I&#039;d stick to those who offer bulk in their listings and stay in escrow.&nbsp;

				Preciate that fellas, its been astonishing to me that with everything else thats offered on the site that a big ass bag of pills is not one of them! Any other suggestions as how to obtain one would be greatly appreciated also. And to iceman ive never dealt with hydromorphine so i dont really fuck with anything i dont have extensive knowledge about.
