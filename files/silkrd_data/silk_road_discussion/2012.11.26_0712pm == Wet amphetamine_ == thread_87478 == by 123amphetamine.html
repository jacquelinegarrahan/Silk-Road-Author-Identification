I&#039;m from the Philadelphi area and had connections with the Pagans MC. Yea, that shit will &quot;melt&quot; on you. I&#039;ve actually seen it liquify. There&#039;s not a lot you can do. We used to get these little crystals . I think they were called blue dry and put them in with the meth. They were blue and when they would get saturated, they would turn clear. Unfortunately, they were very small, and you would have to scrape the meth off them, which wasn&#039;t easy. We would basically use them in lrger quntites to prevent any melting . I wouldn&#039;t have any idea if you can still get them. <br /><br />The only other thing I can suggest is dry rice or maybe put it in the freezer. Also, you can eat it and still get off. You can also shoot it.

				Yeah FreedomOutlaw I&#039;m pretty sure he&#039;s talking about &#039;European&#039; amphetamine, so not the METHamphetamine you&#039;re referring to :)<br /><br />@OP<br />Just let the stuff dry and chop it up with a credit card or something. Making it wet is used by vendors to sell more weight but less product ::)

				I think you are referring to speed paste. Very common in Europe... It wont dry fully, it will always have a gummy texture to it. Its best eaten not snorted.

				What you&#039;re talking about here is amphetamine sulphate.<br /><br />Very common in Europe, not so common in the US and other parts of the world.<br /><br />I actually find it better to eat, straight from the bag or wrap bits in something and swallow (bits of tissue, cigarette papers etc)<br /><br />There isn&#039;t anything wrong with your product.<br /><br />ENJOY!
