				I&#039;m in the same spot as you. Just was able to log on for a couple moments on 4/30 but other than that no luck. Got so excited though!<br />I have a product thats going to auto finalize soon...I wish I did that when I had the chance. I just hope DPR rolls it all back so I don&#039;t get an auto-finalize!<br /><br />Lets hope were up soon again!

				On from early this morning, but not for the last hour and a half.<br /><br />Honestly, DPR may need to shut the site down for a week.<br /><br />Run tests on the nodes and know for sure, before coming back online.<br /><br />Silk Road is the face of this movement, and I understand why the hackers attack. What I don&#039;t understand is why alternative marketplaces are not experiencing the same thing but their sites appear to be inferior in look/function, to SR.<br /><br />Any informed thoughts on this.

				Loaded for me last night, but not today.<br /><br />Sucks that they are being so consistently attacked! It really disrupts business. <br /><br />It almost feels like some of the best vendors are losing interest in SR. Certainly some of my favorites have dropped out, or reduced stock choices since all the troubles... (SR downtimes AND bitcoin market issues).<br /><br />I&#039;d hate to think I&#039;ll have to go back to scoring IRL, but that&#039;s seeming more and more likely :(

				I got on twice yesterday and a few times today. The second time I logged on yesterday, it took a while and had to first restart Tor browser. I even took the risk and transferred out some coin to test. Hit the wallet in 40 mins last night. So things seem to be working and getting better. Some vendors haven&#039;t been on in a couple of days according to their profile&#039;s &quot;last seen.&quot;<br /><br />If all goes well, tonight things should be closer to normal. <br /><br />

				I was able to get on today during one of my few random attempts. Worked fast as ever. My mood has completely changed, as all my orders were able to be straightened out, messages read,etc except for one purchase (La Fuente, last seen 4 days ago.)&nbsp; Hopefully all vendors get a turn to get on soon.&nbsp;
