				Just heard that a Large shipment from China was intercepted at the airport this afternoon. Report says Syn.

Now there&#039;s a big underground market for it that was not there before it was prohibited. It&#039;s one of the eternal paradoxes of prohibition of any sort.

				Stay away from bulk powders from sketchy countries like China/India etc. if you are in the US. Don&#039;t do the crime if you can&#039;t pay the time, or work something out so it&#039;s not you who will get fucked if a bulk order is intercepted.

				if your going to post info like this you need to let us know how you found out! or give us a link to an article or something! <br /><br />has anyone seen the show on National Geographic called &quot;To catch a smuggler&quot;? Its all about catching smugglers at JFK but they do show the customs guys in the mail room sometimes.&nbsp; They say that if u ship drugs it will be seized, lol not always true, but it was nice to actually see some customs guys at work and get a brief insight on how they do things, obviously nothing substantial but a good show none the less. <br /><br />

I&#039;ve seen some very interesting catches on the show like meth in shoes from Asia, they claimed the total to be almost a KG, along with all sorts of different stuff in cards, statues and many other things. The scanners they use are hardcore. Colour coded to represent different substances and is almost 3d in the representations. My fav was the ketamine sewn into a rug from India... crazy shit that they caught it. A big eye opener for me. Became very clear its a total crap shoot for both sides. If a really sharp customs officer is watching the scanner they can spot some crazy stuff but once they find something its then a process that takes time and them away from the main line. If the next one in the line isn&#039;t as sharp or whatever or there isn&#039;t another one down the line then everything just glides along...<br /><br />I&#039;ll see if I can find any links to the eps for those interested.

				Obviously clearnet link. And Customs and Border Patrol to boot.<br />Edited: links break, look it up.<br /><br />edited to add - Just as a side note, what the hell is a &quot;local CBP express courier operation?&quot; (paragraph 3)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Chicago Customs and Border Protection Officers and Chemists Find New Harmful Highs Coming to America<br />10/16/2012<br /><br />Chicago – The illegal world of imported synthetic drugs has exploded in recent years with the volume of designer highs reaching whole new levels of mysterious molecular harm. As federal narcotics regulations broaden to include more illegal substances, illicit foreign chemists are wasting no time in concocting and selling new nonscheduled mimicking variations over the internet, hoping to circumvent Schedule 1 Controlled Substance classifications in the United States. In the last few months, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Laboratories and Scientific Services chemists in Chicago have identified three new imported synthetic marijuana and methamphetamine compound derivatives coming to America.<br /><br />[picture of assorted sizes of baggies of white-tan powder]<br />Customs and Border Protection officers sent these samples from incoming international shipments to the Chicago CBP Laboratory for analysis.<br /><br />Recently, Chicago CBP chemists received a new organic synthetic cannabinoid, commonly known as synthetic marijuana. In September, the CBP Laboratory in Puerto Rico received a sample of this new organic compound for analysis from a local CBP express courier operation.<br /><br />The sample was transferred to the Chicago CBP Laboratory which was able to provide further analytical data which was then identified by the CBP Laboratory in San Francisco. Arriving in a parcel from China and mis-manifested as a crystalline powder, this new synthetic marijuana was identified as 5F-AKB48, an analogue of AKB48. The Chicago CBP Laboratory has identified another new variation of synthetic marijuana known as A-834,735, which arrived in a parcel at the Chicago International Mail Branch.<br /><br />During this summer, the Chicago CBP Laboratory analyzed an unknown beige powder and identified it as 6-APDB HCl, an analogue of MDA HCl. MDA HCl is an analogue of MDMA HCl which is also known as ecstasy.<br /><br />“We are seeing a whole new level of synthetic highs coming to America,” said William Wagner, Chicago CBP Laboratory Team Leader. “Our CBP chemists have tested hundreds of samples and uncovered emerging trends in the increase in variations of synthetic marijuana, bath salts and other synthetic drugs. In some cases, the chemical compound that arrives in the overseas packet is 100 to 800 times more potent than its natural counterpart. Upon ingestion, side effects can include elevated heart rates, paranoia, vomiting, severe agitation and hallucinations. It is simply unsafe to take these unknown drugs.”<br /><br />CBP officers, working at international mail facilities and express consignment courier hub operations throughout the country, inspect thousands of incoming parcels each day. Upon detection of a questionable substance, officers will detain the shipment and send samples to CBP chemists for analysis. If the shipment was incorrectly manifested or contained an illegal substance, the shipment is seized.<br /><br />“These unpredictable chemical combinations are sending some users to the hospital and others to the grave,” said Steven Artino, CBP Chicago Acting Director of Field Operations. “Our CBP officers have found these shipments arriving from China and Europe, manifested as various chemicals, white powders, or natural plant materials. The drugs come in bulk or in small kilo-sized heat sealed shiny aluminum Mylar packets that are divided into hundreds of three-gram packets and sold for $30 - $500 each. In recent years, the number of samples sent by our officers to CBP chemists for a determination of legality is increasing.”<br /><br />CBP LSS provides technical advice and analytical assistance to CBP officers, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigations agents, Border Patrol agents, and other government entities on a wide range of imports including synthetic designer drugs. CBP laboratories are located in Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Washington D.C.; Springfield, VA; New York, New York; Savannah, GA; Houston, TX; and Los Angeles, CA.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
