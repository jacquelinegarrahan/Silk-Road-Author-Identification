				Legit in terms of will you get free weed? probably.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t long ago a new vendor would offer free samples to earn trust.&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t mean they wont eventually turn scammer but it&#039;s a step in the right direction. If you take his weed do what is expected and post a review.&nbsp;

				A newer vendor with two feedback wants you to tell him two other legit members that youve bought from?<br />If he messaged me going &quot;hey did so and so buy from you?&quot; Id be like, I have no idea who the fuck you are talking about.<br />Any seller that would verify to someone else who theyve sold you is a fucking idiot, and is straight disrespecting you as a customer.

				That is a huge assumption. You never know how other people are running their business. If you give someone info and get busted long down the line, that info is still attached to you. Just always believe you could be more secure, because shit changes quickly out in the wild.
