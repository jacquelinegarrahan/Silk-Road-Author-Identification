				It must be remembered that we are all part of something much bigger than a website to score drugs. We could all migrate to BMR or Sheep and make money and get high but it would only be a matter of time before they are shut down as well or our movement moves into obscurity and eventual death.<br /><br />The world is watching and the world thinks the agents of oppression have won. But our community is more than just one site and more than just one man. The title DPR itself was created with the intent that it would be held by more than one man or no man at all. It is a myth, a phantom. We NEED to keep that myth alive. We NEED an identical site run by another Dread Pirate Roberts. We need to show the world that we are not vanquished. We need to show them that we can never be vanquished. If the oppressors take down The Silk Road, another Silk Road must rise in its place. If the agents of tyranny capture the Dread Pirate Roberts, another DPR must take the helm and steer us into new waters. Let us show the world that we can never be defeated.<br /><br />Let us not give up the fight.

				i just mentioned on another forum where they are discussing a new silk road 2.0 already. i&#039;m surprised with the money he would have had, that dpr wasn&#039;t operating from an osamaesque style walled compound in the hills of pakistan.

				Equally important to any reincarnation of the Dread Pirate and Silk Road is the continued commitment of the site, the pirate, and the community to the values that made us unique. It is our dedication to peace and free markets, to societal improvement through mutually beneficial trade, to a rejection that anyone has the right to coerce others or demand tribute without consent, that gives us the moral high ground and separates us from common thugs (governmental or street). Any DPR or SR that is not committed to these ideals may as well not start at all for they would only do harm to our community and our movement.

				Whomever decides to step up and undertake such a task must be very intelligent and very, very cautious. Someone who has the right technical knowledge with computers, networks, programming, and hacking. Maybe even a military background. Ideally this person would have a solid cover life, maybe a spouse and kids, work a regular &#039;dayjob,&#039; or own a small business. This person must have impeccable operational security and must make sure they are beyond careful. The good news is the genie has been let out of the bottle and there&#039;s no putting it back in, so whoever takes over won&#039;t have to worry about spreading the word like DPR did (which came back to bite him), the community infastructure is already here. So all that needs is the right person who knows what they are doing. Also this person can learn ALOT from Silk Road and the mistakes that were made, so as to improve security and minimize risk. Always use encryption, never use any email or username that can be linked to you, always use TOR, find a good country with good internet infastructure, preferably with no extradition treaty with the US, and never try to pay to have anyone silenced. Have a good escape plan, where if security or your identity are compromised, you get out and destroy the evidence and go into stealth mode if necessary, make the keys and instructions available as a last resort so if you have to abandon ship, the torch can be passed and the mission continued by someone else.
