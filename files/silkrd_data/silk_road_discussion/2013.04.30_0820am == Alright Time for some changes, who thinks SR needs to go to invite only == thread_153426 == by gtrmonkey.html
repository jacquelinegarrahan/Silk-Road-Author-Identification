				Due to all the noobs, and the explosion growth of SR. I think aswell as a couple other member. SR should go to invite only. <br />Some guide lines I thought of.<br />&nbsp;Invites should be give by purchase stats, and activity, The reddit, needs to go. Invites screening process should be on a tor like irc, tested on dosage knowledge, PGP, and should be given sparingly. Invite screening should cost amount of btc. This would make sure that the new member understand how to get btc, how to use pgp, and is not going to over dosage and die. All noob friendly tuts need to be locked down and removed. Sorry guys, we need smart people here that are technology inclined.&nbsp; We need people that learn by research, not by getting there handheld. This is just fine tuning this machine. Cutting out the fat.<br /><br />This will cut out the dumb questions. Training Session is over, people need to learn and research themselves.<br /><br />Fewer Scammers, This will make the Feedback for vendors more legit, and cut down I on vendor bluffing I.e making new accounts and buying drugs from your vendor account make it seem like you have good feedback.<br /><br />Safer for everyone. Obviously makes it hard for L.E to see whats going on.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Fewer buyers( but really S.R vendors are making a profit still and still selling out)<br /><br /><br />If you can think of anything else to this disscusion, that would be great, talk about the pros and cons on invite only.<br /><br />Mods a poll would be great if you could add one also

				The Reddit, the public news stories, the youtube instructional videos all need to go. Underground should be more UNDERground. Only our opinion :)<br /><br />good to block onion.to and tor2web proxy if possible.<br /><br />Invite only too much, noobs not the problem and good for business. <br /><br />Maybe need SR2, SRPro where person need $3000 to transfer in at first to open account. Not as fee or bond, to show you serious and have the $ and can do bulk business. <br /><br />Only ideas&nbsp; ???<br /><br />.

				Something needs to be done that&#039;s for sure. I want the vendors to get as much as they can but I just can&#039;t help but think if there wasn&#039;t so much attention things would be going much smoother right now or in other words no dos attack for days. Sorry I don&#039;t have much to input beyond my support for something to be done. I don&#039;t know about invite only because I&#039;m sure if that was implemented before I joined I probably would never have been able to register yet I still have sense enough not to tell anyone online or offline or bring any unwanted attention or a introduce it to a person that would basically be a disaster waiting to happen. Basically a responsible user. I believe if anyone wants something bad enough they&#039;ll find a way so no need to blab about it.

				Invite only wouldn&#039;t create anything more positive for SR. This is what would happen....<br /><br />Scammers could invite themselves to new accounts (less amount of buyers/same amount of scammers means higher prices)<br />DPR would earn less money (therefore he will need to put his commission up)<br />Vendors would have less customer base (therefore prices will need to go up)<br />Less new vendors would appear (less new products on the market)<br /><br />All this means is that the price of product will go up and then buyers will go elsewhere. <br />

				there are not many options that are not a double edged sword or go against basic beliefs of the site.<br /><br />pay to be a member,&nbsp; whats the point scammer will still pay cuz they will scam 10x<br /><br />invite only, i understand limiting the people joining lowers scams but invites will still be sold, traded,etc look at private torrent trackers.&nbsp; not to mention dea etc already have accounts here<br /><br />there are no real options that do not have any negative repercussions. atleast in my opinion

				luckily i can still talk to my vendors, love u guys.&nbsp; &nbsp;it looks like dpr isn&#039;t going anywhere, and you may get your wish with a semi private sr with multiple addresses -personally i think thats a great idea since resources can&#039;t be bogged down on the only sr tor address in existence. <br /><br />i have no idea how dpr can keep the site up in it&#039;s current fashion with a never ending migration of&nbsp; new users.&nbsp; put new users on sr2.0 or something, many of&nbsp; us i&#039;m sure deserve priority for the sacrifices we made already, as buyers and vendors.&nbsp; this movement is destined into the golden age, not a few golden years.

Kinda been here for a while.<br /><br />Ummm yea this is not a response to the ddos attacks, everyone is treating it as such.<br /><br />Anyways Vendors are making bank off repeat business. Alot of vendors dont want to deal with new people pming them every 5 secs. About where there package is and how to use pgp. You would still have new business just at a slower rate. I dont get why everyone thinks Vendors only make money off new accounts. Because they dont. Which is why most vendors execpt new ones require a certain number or transaction and money spent before they allow you to do business with them. Really lets be honest the most business you would be losing is the F.E people.&nbsp; <br /><br />Note I made this thread not to get bashed. I am not trying to teach DPR anything. :rolleyes: , its just an Idea. <br /><br />To the screening process bash comments. Well thats what a discussion is here for right?. Tweak and tune. I am not saying it has to be done like this. <br /><br />Motek, wow man, seriously Jan 2013, acting like you know Limitless, nut riding to max.You weren&#039;t even a member when he was a mod, let alone range rover thread.&nbsp; I can only assume your a continuous nut rider that has nothing to contribute . Flaunting around krama, because you achieve post whoring. status. Nice. <br /><br />Blksheep, not even worth my time. <br /><br />Delta11, danknugsdun, wraithe, canuckboy, Sensei, flwrchlds9, Lucius Luv. Thank you all for bring something to the discussion that is productive.<br /><br />There is alot of truth, to &quot;The more people that go on SR the more anonymous we become&quot;. While this is true, it does create allot of unnecessary, heat. In my opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />I totally like the idea also of having a second tier SR or a semi private verison.

				I personally think these growing pains will end in time. <br /><br />I believe some outside the box server work could be in order (Ports old boy), but I do have respect for DPR for all he has said and done. Nothing easily gained holds value, and while I trust the methods of the road, by going &quot;invite only&quot; the man has won. I for one want anyone willing to try, to do so. Keep our cops on the real criminals, plus some good bud too on here :)<br /><br />-F&amp;H<br /><br />Speaking of that,hey delta :)

				I don&#039;t like the idea of making it private.&nbsp; Sure it would work for me since I&#039;m already here, but I&#039;m applying the golden rule.&nbsp; It would royally piss me off if I say a month from now I found out about SR, came to join, and found it&#039;s invite only and I don&#039;t know anyone who&#039;s a member who can invite.&nbsp; I think if SR wanted to be a private operation, they would/should have been that way from day 1.&nbsp; I know of another site that is similar to SR which is invite only, not sure if it still exists, but I was never able to get an invite to it even after begging for one from strangers online so I say fuck the whole invite idea.

				How about we split the difference - implement a buyer score / membership rank system, where buyers with refund / AF rates below a certain %, as well as vendor feedback on their experience with a buyer, allows for &quot;proven&quot; members to have a small, private site that you graduate to when you prove you&#039;re up to SR snuff :)<br /><br />People can still join freely, and buy from vendors freely, but vendors can chose to make listings only available to known members. There&#039;s still incentive to sell to the new members, and more pressure on buyers to keep their account in good standing (don&#039;t try to blackmail with feedback, etc)<br /><br />People will complain that this hurts small buyers / unfairly favors buyers who buy in large amounts, but to be fair, they&#039;re making the biggest financial contributions to the road - a customer who buys 50,000 air conditioners a year is going to have a private line to GE tech support, as opposed to a homeowner.

				I agree with the invite only aspect, but when silk road has done nothing but cater to newbies ( how-tos, basically one stop info shops for things like btc,pgp, things people should be researching theirselves). In-depth talk about btc and pgp should be banned. those things have their own info sources. Kids and irresponsible people are more likely to be on SR if they can go from computer-illiterate to buying and selling in a black market and on technology they dont understand or respect, if they can do so without having to leave one stickied thread. <br /><br />If SR wanted to clean up, it could. Gram listings of pot? No one is going through the trouble to spend 29 bucks on a gram of weed 2000 miles away, unless 29 bucks is all they have to spend. Which to me is typically a person who shouldnt be using SR.&nbsp; Theirs lots of things that could cut out a lot of the riff raff. <br /><br />

				The point is, SR has enough established vendors. Its like greed. SR couldnt grow too big, they knew that. Cap members, and new vendors can thrive in their own market, with their own customers. What do you do when a parking lot is full? ramp on top of other cars?&nbsp; &nbsp;Its the same thing with this market. If I wanted to sell drugs on the internet, I wouldbe be offended for not being allowed in a group based on senority or a grandfather clause. Thats why such clauses exist, to create a defining point.

				Of course it should not be invite only! That would go directly against Dread Pirate Roberts ideas and philosophy that he shared in Forbes. So, what exclusive group should be allowed in? People with over 5 years will say, well people with over 5 years of course! One your people, same thing. How about whites only? I say as long as I&#039;m in the club I should be in and I don&#039;t care about who else. Isn&#039;t one of the guiding principals here that we are accepted for who we are and are free behind these doors to do what we want as long as we don&#039;t hurt anyone else. How about we stand together as a group to support the group and DPR.<br /><br />Once you start &quot;suggesting&quot; a closed good ole boy club, YOU should be booted out! Just my humble opinion.

				there could be a stats based system in place; that would make it alot easier on the back end than to process invites on a case-by-case basis.<br /><br />like, 5 transactions minimum with 0% AF or 10 trans. with &gt;10% AF, and so on.

				Yeah invite only seems a bit rash, just being able to get on here should be enough.&nbsp; Well I guess not anymore with all the guides and how easy it has gotten in the last year or so.&nbsp; <br /><br />This may not be realistic but maybe some kind of test for new customers could be put in place, maybe like a multiple choice...example question: <br /><br />1) Which one of these should the silk road address end in...<br /><br />a) .onion.to<br />b) .onion<br />c) .com<br />d) all of the above<br /><br />Obviously anyone could just take the test until they get them all right. But a little test with a few questions that seem to get new buyers in trouble sounds good to me.&nbsp;

				I agree that people should be doing their own research rather than just berating the forums with every imaginable question. With the increased attention PGP should really be mandatory at this point for ordering. If you can&#039;t figure that out on your own you shouldn&#039;t be using SR. <br /><br />While SR will probably always be open to everyone while its around (which I agree with, everyone deserves access ) I think there is definitely a huge market for a more technically and financially elite, security hardened anon market. Just for people who are doing serious business with advanced tech capabilities. Developers could even make a hack the only way to gain access or something.<br /><br />But just talking to friends of mine, most people think even going to the site is nuts. My most technically inclined friends are still beyond sketched out by it and won&#039;t consider using it. I think its going to blow up to a point but most people will just never consider using a tor market for so many reasons. Those of us who are comfortable using btc anonymously and using tor markets tend to forget that because were used to it and it seems easy. <br />It just sucks that hacker(s) are attacking the site so much now. Its gained attention from very sophisticated hackers now, so an invite only kind of thing won&#039;t stop them. Fucking hack a major bank or something that will benefit humanity :( Long Live DPR I hope he&#039;s able to get a handle on this problem.

				I honestly think most folks won&#039;t, can&#039;t figure out how to get here. Heck most people can barely manage getting onto the internet! LOL. Those who do, did some work and maybe that&#039;s enough. <br /><br />The much bigger issue, in my opinion, is all the publicity. The Forbes article is crazy mainstream and I think that may be a big issue. I was not even looking for that info and found it. Lets see Forbes mag, politicians, drug mart, anti-state, boom. Or worse yet, some numb nut will OD and they will be linked back to SR and its all over. I watched it happen with poppy pods and ebay. Remember, its always someone else&#039;s fault.

				No no no to the OP.<br /><br />The more people who know they can anonymously and safely purchase drugs, the more security in numbers we all gain. SR is an experiment in freedom, of anarcho/crypto-capitalism. It is counter to the philosophy to restrict its usage based on some arbitrary requirement. <br /><br />Eventually, enough people may use the Road to make it futile for the State to continue the drug war<br /><br />I hope it happens quickly for the sake of all the people locked in cages now by the State.

				Everyones entitled to their opinion. Hope everyone understands only one opinion matters though.<br /><br />The bottom line is, SR DOES need to choose a niche. Does it want to be chinese ebay, or barret jackson?&nbsp; SR can run off all the big time spenders who have been sending and receiving drugs in the mail for decades, and cater to warp-minded teenagers who stole their mothers credit card to buy bitcoins, if they want to. But I&#039;d rather leave that type of traffic for the &#039;competition&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But what do I know, i run my life on values and common sense, not profit.

				I get the spirit of the conversation here. Yet...<br /><br />I don&#039;t think an &quot;invite-only&quot; or any other system that restricts access is consistent with my understanding of the SR philosophy. But it does seem that vendors could (indeed some already do) restrict access by refusing to serve potential customers who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing yet.

				Come on, this goes completely against everything Silk Road stands for. The Silk Road is fighting the War on Drugs. It is not our place to say, &quot;Well, you don&#039;t get to fight the government in the War on Drugs because you missed the boat.&quot; The Silk Road gives easily accessible safe, quality drugs to ANYONE who chooses to join. Will there be some obstacles along the way? Of course. No revolution happens without some difficulties. But if we decide to give up and start limiting who is allowed to participate, then we admit defeat at the hands of the state. DPR and his team have shown that they are up to the challenge. In the grand scheme of things, a few weeks of off and on service is a slight distraction compared to the amazing things we as a community have already accomplished. Now isn&#039;t the time to be selfish. I&#039;m all for letting anyone join the revolution. The more we have, the better. Perhaps the Silk Road is no longer a secret, but hey, I say that might be a good thing! It means that more people are joining us everyday, and the government is powerless to stop it. That being said, any vendor who wishes may of course go into stealth mode and start accepting only current customers or customers that have impeccable stats. That&#039;s fine, that&#039;s their right as salesmen in the free market. But the free market itself can&#039;t be shut down like that. I&#039;d rather be patient and let DPR work out the kinks than have the site adopt a philosophy that basically says you&#039;re not allowed to join the fight unless you know the right people. That philosophy already existed when drugs were all bought on the street. The Silk Road is supposed to end that problem. If you want to put a substance in your body, here is your golden ticket.

				Heh, people said the same thing way back when Gawker started gawking at shit, was a shitty idea then too. Every federal agent with a computer is already here, make it invite only and you&#039;ll just be taking away more potential money from the marketplace while the 500,000 feds already here just invite all their fed friends as they see fit to rape the stalled market, it&#039;s not like making it invite only would prevent them from doing anything they would have done before. Also, being that we&#039;re on Tor it&#039;s not exactly difficult for anyone to share an account here. As for scammers, I can pretty much guarantee you people will start selling invites, and as I&#039;m sure you know scammers don&#039;t mind putting in a little start-up money to turn a quick profit.

				The cats already out of the bag when it comes to keeping it quiet, to some degree a bit of a shame. But isn&#039;t it like giving in to the attackers who ever they are to tuck our heads in and become selective? We need to prove that this is a better system than buying from dodgy dealers in pubs and street corners and getting ripped off with poison crap in a bag. As divinechemicals said it is already selective on the streets as to who can buy and who can&#039;t and that creates resentment. I do agree that the YouTube and other &#039;how to&#039; stuff on the open web do need to go as they encourage phishing. Well that&#039;s my 2 cents worth.

				Invite only means vendors make less money, IE some vendors leave, prices go up.<br />Lets keep the prices the way they are. If more and more vendors are added prices will drop.

It is not our place to say, &quot;Well, you don&#039;t get to fight the government in the War on Drugs because you missed the boat.&quot; The Silk Road gives easily accessible safe, quality drugs to ANYONE who chooses to join. Will there be some obstacles along the way? Of course. No revolution happens without some difficulties. But if we decide to give up and start limiting who is allowed to participate, then we admit defeat at the hands of the state. DPR and his team have shown that they are up to the challenge. In the grand scheme of things, a few weeks of off and on service is a slight distraction compared to the amazing things we as a community have already accomplished. Now isn&#039;t the time to be selfish. I&#039;m all for letting anyone join the revolution. The more we have, the better. Perhaps the Silk Road is no longer a secret, but hey, I say that might be a good thing! It means that more people are joining us everyday, and the government is powerless to stop it. That being said, any vendor who wishes may of course go into stealth mode and start accepting only current customers or customers that have impeccable stats. That&#039;s fine, that&#039;s their right as salesmen in the free market. But the free market itself can&#039;t be shut down like that. I&#039;d rather be patient and let DPR work out the kinks than have the site adopt a philosophy that basically says you&#039;re not allowed to join the fight unless you know the right people. That philosophy already existed when drugs were all bought on the street. The Silk Road is supposed to end that problem. If you want to put a substance in your body, here is your golden ticket.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+karma x 10000<br /><br />I am patient. I am in this for the long haul. I don&#039;t care about a couple of days or even weeks of downtime. <br /><br />Consider that the State has created &quot;downtime&quot; in the entire country for the drug consumer. In comparison, this is nothing.<br /><br />I understand vendor frustration but this is NOTHING in comparison to being dragged away and put into a cage. In fact 9/10 vendors see it this way too, that&#039;s what this thread has shown.<br /><br />The ones kvetching are mainly the buyers, who frankly are expecting just a bit too much. This place only looks like Amazon.com. This is the beginning of a black market industrial revolution. It&#039;s been only going on for about 2 years! There will be hiccups and you should expect the occasional inconvenience when *practically every single law enforcement on the planet is trying to shut this place down!*<br />

				I dont think anyone on one side of the argument gets it. SR can&#039;t&nbsp; support anymore people! Do you know how many members are on SR staff (not including forum moderators)? Do you know how chaotic and childish things are were before the publicity that flooded this place with even more pathetic customers and attracked 100times the scammers? DPR is a nanny, a nurse, technician, janitor, for thousands of idiots. If you are against lowering or at least maintaining a bearable idiot ratio, then youre just simpley an irrational person.<br /><br />If you want price high, quantity low, service bad, and to never be able to get on because 14 year olds are taking up the bandwidth anyway,then I&#039;m glad for you sticking to your anarchical &#039;freedom&#039; mechanism, I&#039;m sure SR will be a lovely place in that paths future.

				The entire basis of DPR&#039;s concept is to empower the individual and bring down flawed systems.This notion cannot be accomplished within an invite only structure IMO.The Silk Road is a big idea, which could cause a complete paradigm shift within many societies. <br /><br />There is some hope for the future:<br /><br />(clearnet) <br /><br />http://reason.com/blog/2013/05/02/poll-millennials-increasingly-distrust-t<br /><br />Young Americans are increasingly divided on a host of issues, but they do agree on one thing: They have damned little use for government institutions. Oddly, the one institution likely to get millennials — specifically, those between 18 and 29 years of age — killed, the military, is the only one they trust to do the right thing all or most of the time. The folks in uniform get the trust of 54 percent trust of this group. That&#039;s down a point from last year, but it&#039;s better than the Supreme Court gets (40 percent now, 45 percent in 2012), the president (39 percent now, down from 41 percent in 2012) or Congress (18 percent, down from 23 percent). The federal government as a whole draws the trust of a whopping 22 percent of respondents.<br /><br />“That’s disappointing,&quot; says C. M. Trey Grayson, director of the Institute of Politics, &quot;especially because we know that people’s political attitudes are often greatly impacted at the beginning of their adulthood, when they enter the political process.”<br /><br />From the Harvard Crimson:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Young adults aged 18 to 29, also known as the millennial generation, have an increased distrust in every political institution except the military, according to a biannual Institute of Politics report released Tuesday. Written and analyzed by students, the report also showed an increased polarization among party lines since the election and split opinions about gun regulation.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, director of the Institute of Politics, said he was particularly alarmed by the long-term implications of the poll’s results, explaining that the support of the millennials is key to the future stability of modern American institutions like the media, local and federal governments, and Wall Street.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “You hope the process can work, the system can work, politics can work,” Grayson said. “We’ve got to give millennials a reason to trust these institutions.”<br /><br />Incidentally, the rest of the results are also interesting. Millennials are becoming increasingly polarized on a number of issues, from government spending to immigration to guns. According to the authors of the survey, the &quot;gap in opinion between the way Democrats and Republicans see politics and in many cases the world, has grown sharper and more distinctive since 2010.&quot; For example:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; On the issue of whether or not “government spending is an effective way to increase growth,” in 2010 the difference between the number of Democrats and Republicans who agree with this statement was 17 points, today the number is 24 points with most of the difference accounted for by less Republican support (as compared to more support form Democrats). While disagreement among Democrats is consistent at 20 percent between 2010 and today, Republican disagreement with this concept increased six percentage points from 49 to 55 percent.<br /><br />Ideological self-sorting also seems to be growing. According to the Crimson, &quot;The division of the government was even reflected in the social lives of the Millennials. Only 12 percent said that their most recent significant other did not share their political beliefs, while 72 percent reported that all or most of their friends do.&quot;<br /><br />As for just who these respondents are:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 38 percent self-identify as liberal or leaning liberal, 26 percent moderate, and 36 percent conservative or leaning conservative;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 37 percent consider themselves Democrats, 25 percent Republicans, and 37 percent Independents.<br /><br />So ... plenty of variety in views, united by a wholesome distrust toward the state, even if that disappoints Director Grayson.<br /><br />The Survey of Young Americans’ Attitudes Toward Politics and Public Service: 23rd Edition

				Hello guys, i read a lot of nice word here but if we got to this kind of changes, is because this market is getting less and less accessible every day..<br />so the question here is do we want a free market open to averyone that doesnt work, or works well a couple of days a week....or do we want a full functional market with a limited access but still not completly private?<br />Im all for the freedom,but i prefer the second one...<br />ppfld<br />

I think aswell as a couple other member. SR should go to invite only. <br />Some guide lines I thought of.<br />&nbsp;Invites should be give by purchase stats, and activity, The reddit, needs to go. Invites screening process should be on a tor like irc, tested on dosage knowledge, PGP, and should be given sparingly. Invite screening should cost amount of btc. This would make sure that the new member understand how to get btc, how to use pgp, and is not going to over dosage and die. All noob friendly tuts need to be locked down and removed. Sorry guys, we need smart people here that are technology inclined.&nbsp; We need people that learn by research, not by getting there handheld. This is just fine tuning this machine. Cutting out the fat.<br /><br />This will cut out the dumb questions. Training Session is over, people need to learn and research themselves.<br /><br />Fewer Scammers, This will make the Feedback for vendors more legit, and cut down I on vendor bluffing I.e making new accounts and buying drugs from your vendor account make it seem like you have good feedback.<br /><br />Safer for everyone. Obviously makes it hard for L.E to see whats going on.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Fewer buyers( but really S.R vendors are making a profit still and still selling out)<br /><br />If you can think of anything else to this disscusion, that would be great, talk about the pros and cons on invite only.<br /><br />Mods a poll would be great if you could add one also<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />While i agree something has to be done, this is not the way to go about it. Sr cannot go invite only that is outlandish and so is a minimum buy in of $3000, I can tell you straight that if i was asked to put in $3000 minimum when i was new to a site i would walk away and never come back. People need to be able to come and go as they please and feel comfortable before making purchases. <br /><br />And you do realize noobs make up a hell of a lot of business on SR? this is meant to be a community . Nobody who doesn&#039;t want to hold somebody&#039;s hand all the way doesn&#039;t have to, You can simply ignore their posts and get on with your own business. The tutorials and countless helpful members on here who give advice and tutorials is invaluable to some and even me. Nobody knows everything so it&#039;s great to have a place where you can ask questions and learn.<br /><br />when i first started i was shit at the whole idea of things, Now it&#039;s like riding a bike, you just do it. And so will everybody else with time and im so glad there were people on here that were kind enough to help me out! you cant just say only people with experience are aloud to use SR and especially not invite only, who is going to take the time to send these invites etc? and it would only be a certain amount of time before somebody figured out an exploit for that anyway. The mods are working overtime to try ad stop spammers etc constantly. Scout is on here fucking 18 hours a day clearing up spam alone so there is no way they have the time to send out invites.<br /><br />The amount of revenue loss would be unreal as well. It is a marketplace, if noobs want to be stupid and not use PGP that&#039;s their own fault, but that is also their own problem. <br />DPR and mods are working on a new security system as we speak, So you SRMOD2 is basically on the way. all we need is advanced security nothing more. You dont wanna help the noobs? Fine just ignore them, Nobody is Pming you constantly for advice and telling you to help them do this and that, If they were you are perfectly within your rights to say &quot;no thanks im too busy&quot; Simple. <br /><br />thanks to all the mods and DPR for making the marketplace friendly for everyone. I would not be where i am today without you. the help i have received from fellow members as well is unbelievable. And in turn i like to think i have helped a few noobs along the way. It&#039;s the way it should be and SR should not be limited to elitists only.

Nothing at all, and on top of that this is an anonymous forum so nobody knows or really cares if you do this so please don&#039;t use this as reference as a point of authority. Also, I don&#039;t know why people pull up the &quot;Oh yeah I was at a party and this guy I know talked about SR and some other guy did and so did his dog man but it wasn&#039;t his dog he was just on acid BUT HE WAS STILL TALKING ABOUT SR!&quot; like this is going to cause the sky to fall down on their heads and the Apocalypse to start in all it&#039;s fiery earnest. Why does someone else talking about something automatically put you in the frame? It does not. I&#039;ve had many people come up to me and talk about SR and how they get their shit from SR and one guy even talked about it so much he was telling me the full mechanics of it and how it was &quot;the only future of drug dealing&quot; and I just said &quot;Oh really, I dunno sounds weird&quot; nodded my head and smiled. The idea that people talking about it at parties and that you apparently still go to the ghettos to smoke some of your horrible shit is any reason for SR to be invite only is fairly absurd.
