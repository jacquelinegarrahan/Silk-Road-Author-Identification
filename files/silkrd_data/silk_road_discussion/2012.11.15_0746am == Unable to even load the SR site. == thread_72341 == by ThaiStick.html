				I&#039;m having some trouble getting onto the main site, I know that they&#039;ve been down for a bit but I keep on being unable to log-in. I don&#039;t have PGP set up yet, I do have back up BTC addresses for my investors, but I&#039;m a bit slow because I had some personal issues to deal with over the last week and I want to keep my investors &amp; customers updated.<br /><br />Sometimes the homepage will load (very rarely) but after I try to login it simply doesn&#039;t load after that.<br /><br />Can any one suggest any actions to take? I&#039;ve done pretty much everything I know, used TOR on a clean machine / computer, updated to the latest release, renewed IP many times and even used the iPhone app but no luck.<br /><br />Should I carry on trying or just wait till everything is back on track?

				Relax guys, its down for a bit I&#039;m sure it will be back up soon<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like the way DPR runs things I&#039;m sure you can always do it your own way<br />Complaining and nagging isn&#039;t going to get anyone anywhere! <br />I am sure DPR is doing his best, because when he is down he is losing money too!
