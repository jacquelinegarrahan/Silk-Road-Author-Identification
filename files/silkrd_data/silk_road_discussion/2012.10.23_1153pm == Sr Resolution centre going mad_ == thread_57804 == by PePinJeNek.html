				Hi,<br /><br />Like many I got scammed by MrfireUk however<br />for the 1st time ever I had my coins in escrow.<br />So when It all came out I was happy not to have FE<br />but just extended the time by almost 2months to give him<br />the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />But when it was finally about to run out of extended time and it became<br />clear the vendor did not send anything(especially down under) I decided<br />to ask for a 100% refund. After MrfireUk offered me 60% . <br />I wrote a few emails prior to my case running out extended time to SR<br />&nbsp;customer service explaining my case and backing up my suspicion of <br />this vendor scamming, without much luck since they are backed up replying <br />to emails.<br /><br />Ok so I wrote everything I had to say in the resolution centre console <br />hopiing they would at leat read that bit.<br /><br />To cut a long story short I asked them to refund me the money without affecting my stats(I know this is possible)<br />For the simple reason that there is heaps of proof that he has not sending anything and lots of people lost lots of cash.<br />I also included the fact that I had be scammed by tony76, esgal and coking and that It would only be fair to cut me <br />some slack. as I did not want my stats ruined over this and having to start a new account.(member for 9 months)<br />I specificly asked to take all this&nbsp; matter into consideration however yesterday I recieved and standard respond<br />TELLING ME THEY HAD SETTLED ON A 0% REFUND ??? <br />So they give me nothing, they did not read any of my emails prior to the case running out of time. They did not respond first <br />giving&nbsp; me an option to take the 60% already offered by MrfireUK nor did the explain why did could not help me out<br />knowing this vendor was ripping people off.!!<br /><br />Conclusion I probably lost around $600<br /><br />I am going to try to get my money back somehow<br />and if I have to start a new account so be it.<br />This is unfortunatly no pocket change for me.<br />And if this is what SR want , for people to just <br />start new accounts afer a refund than thats a worry.<br /><br />Any thoughts / info ??<br /><br />Thanks for reading my cry&nbsp; :) <br />

				I had a similar situation today.<br /><br />No problem with the vendor, but with SR.<br /><br />I could not log in for the last 12 hours I had to resolve everything in escrow.<br /><br />Finally, I am able to log in, guess what, AFTER the money was out of escrow robbing me of the chance of an extension or refund.<br /><br />I mean, you have GOT to be kidding me. I used to just think people on here were bitching, but this shit&#039;s got to stop.<br /><br />SR has been working fine for me for weeks. Just ran a computer scan and updated to the new TOR and &quot;still&quot; couldn&#039;t log on.<br /><br />For some reason, from a Silk Road perspective, I&#039;m just not buying it.<br /><br />Every time, there is no refund they get their percentage, regardless.
