				Hey guys,<br /><br />So I was approached via the SR Message System by, &quot;ilovedeath&quot; the other day and he wanted to buy a 25 pack order of suboxone and said he was .13 BTC short. I, being the nice guy, sent it to him with the trust that he would buy one of my orders. Anyway, next message from him was &quot;since the fluctuation in BTC&quot;, he needed .11 more and he was ready to order. So, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me now, I did it one more time thinking that would seal our deal. It didn&#039;t, he asked a third time and after editing the listing for him to basically sell him the amount equal to how many total BTC he had in his account, he still wanted that Bitcoin from me. So then, I knew it was a scam. <br /><br />I tried being nice and even though I more than likely won&#039;t see the money again, this is a warning to all you dealers about &quot;ilovedeath&quot;, do not deal with him, I msged SR Admin and basically he&#039;s on his way to getting kicked off the site.<br /><br />There&#039;s another guy I Just sold to in the recent that claims he didn&#039;t get one of our (5 pack) orders, but, tracking shows he indeed did. I never sent him the tracking # because it&#039;s a hassle to keep sending it knowing how slow the site usually is, so, I was hoping (like in most my deals) the buyer would finalize when they received. Well with this one guy, it&#039;s been over 9 days and no finalize. So, I msged him and he said he didn&#039;t get it and was checking the mail every day, but , tracking says otherwise, so I call &#039;scammer&#039; on this. I sent him the tracking # now and I guess let&#039;s see how he deals with it. Question is, how does SR deal with issues like this ie. buyer claims they never receive goods but tracking # says otherwise. I never had a problem with shipments and I have 100% feedback on the site. I have tracking confirming the mailer got to its destination. How does SR Admin work with situations like this?<br /><br />Thanks guys

				Man some people are just too fucking STUPID.<br /><br />This guy tried to get me. Tried to place a large order of my ketamine but said he as 0.13 short. He asked me for it, but OBVIOUSLY I am not going to send a buyer ANY of my BTC so I just edited my listing to be 0.13 cheaper. <br /><br />I messaged him and said go ahead and buy but he still said He needs 0.13. At this point I knew it was a scam.<br /><br />Now OP, how fucking STUPID do you need to be? Personally I would never purchase off a vendor so dim witted.

				Cheapest K in Aus is $190 per gram from Alchemister. That is not something to be proud of considering you most likely paid much less than $40 per gram for it.<br /><br />All that says is that Australian K vendors are a bunch of greedy fucking rip-off merchants only in it for the BTC.<br /><br />If you gave half a shit about your customers, you wouldn&#039;t be bleeding them dry. You could charge HALF of what your are now and still make a tidy profit. You are just greedy and taking advantage of gullible people. Plain and simple.

				Maybe if you had any idea of the sheer risk of importing LARGE amounts of drugs in Australia were, then you might understand. You have no idea of the risk I place on myself. Why do you think there&#039;s not many Aus vendors? It&#039;s a big risky game mate and you need balls to play it.<br /><br />Maybe if you also understood that Australian Customs are the best out there, and that I&#039;ve incurred a lot more losses than you would imagine from seizures, you might further understand.<br /><br />Not to mention, It&#039;s a completely different market here mate. Our cost of living is higher, but we also earn more money compared to foreign countries, so why should I charge a lesser value than overseas? It makes sense to charge more because in relation to our market I am proportionately making roughly the same as anyone else overseas.<br /><br />You&#039;re just a buyer though. You don&#039;t understand. All these factors justify the prices you see in Australian Silkroad. It&#039;s not gonna change, so quit bitching.<br /><br />You&#039;re a greedy buyer, that&#039;s all.

Balls will get you thrown into jail along will all the other macho cunts. There are fuck all Australian vendors because they charge too much and no-one buys from them, not because its risky. Our cost of living is higher because of greedy fucking merchants country-wide looking to make a quick buck off gullible buyers. All your factors don&#039;t mean shit when its fear, uncertainty and doubt.<br /><br />Don&#039;t assume to know what I do or who I am. You don&#039;t know shit.

				I&#039;m not gonna tit tat back and forth like a child with you mate.<br /><br />What I understand by your reply is that you acknowledge that cost of living in Australia is higher and that prices (and wages) and much higher also. This alone can justify higher Australian prices. Like you say, you need a brain to do business here so why don&#039;t you fire yours up and realise how exactly business works.<br /><br />Accompany our market with our customs agency&#039;s (which you can&#039;t deny they are the best in the world) high seizure rate and voila - you have Australian drug prices. Sure not all my packages get seized but I have incurred big losses from failed imports. My most recent was 500g MDMA seized.<br /><br /><br />Now, I don&#039;t really give a shit who you are, but you have proven you&#039;re only a buyer in your thread where you posted about a bank teller asking you why you were buying bitcoins. No vendor needs to buy bitcoins from a bank. <br /><br />Thus -&nbsp; You lose.<br /><br /><br />I am out of here, buddy.
