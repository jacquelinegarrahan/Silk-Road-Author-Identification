				Hey. I think this is my first post here. I had problems for few days because I couldn&#039;t get to login page of SR. But I didn&#039;t mind too much because it was new year and stuff. But today I came to login window but just CAN&#039;T login. I even created a new account. I also tried with false isername/password but it doesn&#039;t even say it is false or wrong captcha or something (dunno if this is to be expected or not). I couldn&#039;0t login into sr forum for ling time too, but now it finally worked. I switched identities but still nothing, sr link is: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/home<br /><br />thanks for help

				Guys you dont need to make new accounts when u cant login.. SR is like that sometimes u just have to keep trying over and over and over sometimes.. Hit new identity once in a while will help also. Its just something that u gotta get use to and understand thats how it is sometimes and has been that way. Its not cause something is wrong with it. I logged in just now for the first time with no issues at all.. Just when u have problems keep trying, sometimes it can take up to a hour iv seen. Not often but it happens..

				Refresh the list of relays.<br /><br />Onion icon -&gt; Network Map -&gt; Refresh<br /><br />Wait a few minutes.<br /><br />Build new circuits.<br /><br />Onion icon -&gt; New Identity<br /><br />That&#039;s usually the most effective thing you can do. You don&#039;t have restart TorBrowser or your computer or any of the other crazy stuff people try. The problem is almost always with the Tor network or the SR server. There&#039;s nothing you can do on your end, on your computer, to solve that.
