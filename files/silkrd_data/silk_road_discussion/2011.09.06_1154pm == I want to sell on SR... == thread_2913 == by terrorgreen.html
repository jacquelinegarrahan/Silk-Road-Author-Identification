				...but I don&#039;t have 22 or even 11 BTC to dish out for it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have much money and won&#039;t have much of anything after buying the products.&nbsp; Am I screwed or is there an alternative way to sell on this fine website?&nbsp; Could I pay whatever amount over a period of time or anything?

				If you can&#039;t front up a few BTC for a sellers a/c, how are you you gonna cover equipment for packing and shipping and have enough to hold you over whilst BTC are in escrow?<br />Must not feed the trolls..

				I agree - depending on your product line a seller should have enough to fork over for an account, buy a good vac-sealer, vag bags, mail supplies, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to mention the product.<br /><br />Throw together a couple of grand and give it a shot then.&nbsp; Until then it&#039;s unfortunately a pipe dream.

				You don&#039;t even have 11 BTC? That&#039;s less than $100. What the hell were you going to sell? That broke ass of yours?<br />Seriously though. What you should do is take donations and loans like Keasy did. We could use more vendors like that.

				Ok, yes I have 22 BTC but if I spend it on a sellers account I will have no money for products.&nbsp; Packaging would just be envelops to start, I plan on selling LSD and mushrooms eventually, along with other psychedelics over time.&nbsp; I probably won&#039;t be selling high quantity to start but I will price my products better than others.<br /><br />It would just be a lot more realistic in my situation to pay for an account after I can make some money with it.

				You could also try and work something out of escrow with a reputable member. You ship your product and they pay after they receive until you can buy a sellers account. But a feature like SR takes 75% of your sale until you have paid off your sellers fee would be cool, but open to a lot of scammers because they would just try and get people to go out of escrow and scam people. But ya I&#039;m kinda in the same boat I have 4 ounces of cracker dry shrooms sitting, while I wait to get $150 to buy a sellers account.

				galtrr is right if you are in need of money then you could send someone 20 hits of acid and have them only pay half up front until they get the rest.&nbsp; it seems if you have acid you can sell it any where in the world on the streets and get the money needed to get&nbsp; a buyers account.&nbsp; with acid the shipping should be cheap.&nbsp;

				You really do need to invest before you start a sellers account. It needs to be treated like a real business and that requires initial financial investment.<br /><br />It&#039;s a tough market to actually make money, especially with BTC volatility. This will of course improve with time and being a seller on SR can be a very rewarding experience on many levels. I encourage you to start!<br /><br />EnterTheMatrix

				if you need to do ftf transactions first in order to gain capital for start-up on sr, then i would suggest on getting started. especially if you have desirable products to offer. it sometimes takes money, to make money. :)
