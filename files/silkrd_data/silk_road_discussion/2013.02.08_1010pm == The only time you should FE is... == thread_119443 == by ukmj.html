				True.<br /><br />Though I have seen some established vendors whose feedback seems to be filled with FE&#039;ers. As they can&#039;t all be new customers, I still don&#039;t see why some people chose to gladly FE for their &#039;trusted vendor&#039;. They&#039;re not a very trusted customer if they have no option but to FE for small orders below 5 BTC. I&#039;ve mostly seen this trend among UK vendors though.

				I have had buyers try and force FE on me, some even go ahead and FE and say so in the feedback, i have always asked them to amend it to clarify i had not requested FE.

				It&#039;s odd as most people are militant about not F/E&#039;ing which I understand as when I use my buyers account I will not FE for anyone ever... <br /><br />Fast forward - to my seller&#039;s acct &amp;&nbsp; I&#039;ve people that FE and say something like &quot;good stats&quot; or &quot;trusted seller&quot;&nbsp; if you FE you release your funds and have no recourse&nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp;We do not require it I know a few seller that do<br /><br />

I&#039;ve only FE&#039;d once and that was for my first transaction, which was a small one anyway.

There have been enough&nbsp; people that FE and lost coins that perhaps others won&#039;t do this so easily. <br /><br />Once you release the funds if anything happens to the seller then you have no recourse.<br /><br />Escrow is there for a reason. It protects both parties.

				Was a nice feeling to get to a stage I wasn&#039;t asked to FE anymore!<br /><br />My very first experience on SR I FE and after a couple of weeks of the item not turning up I contacted the seller and the item arrived after providing the address again. Think it was the start of Sesampino scamming now that I look back on it.<br /><br />Of course I never read the beginners guide like most on here I&#039;d say so learned a lot from experiences, bad and good!
