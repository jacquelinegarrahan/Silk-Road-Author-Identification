				I&#039;m very new here still, and I want to ask you experienced vendors something about refund rates for buyers. Would you consider a refund rate of 5.9%, out of six total transactions for a total of some fifty-odd BTC, excessive? What does a particular refund rate mean, exactly? <br /><br />I got an order and I&#039;m evaluating it to see if I fulfill it or not.<br /><br />Thanks a lot.

				As a vendor, I wouldn&#039;t be overly cautious with a buyer whose refund rate is under 10% as long as he/she has more than 10 transactions. <br /><br />Even worse to me is buyers with a high auto-finalize rate. I will cancel their orders.

				Thanks, Reseller. The person&#039;s got 6 transactions, with Auto-finalize rate: 0%. I guess I&#039;d be OK fulfilling the order.

				How exactly is refund rate calculated?&nbsp; In the instance goblin mentioned above, I originally assumed it meant that out of six total transactions, 5.9% of them resulted in a refund.&nbsp; That would be about 1/3 of one transaction, which made me think I&#039;m missing something.<br /><br />Is it simply that 5.9% of the total BTC spent were refunded?&nbsp; At about 3 BTC for the OP situation, that could easily be one of the six orders, and makes a lot more sense.

				I&#039;ve had one refund in 23 transactions and my refund rate is 5.6%. It&#039;s higher than it should be, especially if I take prices into account, since it was one of my cheapest buys.<br /><br />I found out that this is because SR weighs more recent transactions more heavily (the refund was on my second-to-last buy). This is great, since it can more easily reflect a buyer&#039;s current condition. Say I&#039;ve always been a stand-up buyer but start heavily scamming vendors for refunds... even though I may have over 100 non-refunded transactions under my belt, half a dozen refunds will still make my percentage climb high. And also on the contrary case - if a buyer has had many refunds in the past, but has recently had only smooth transactions, his refund rate will be lower to reflect that.<br /><br />It&#039;s a very nicely thought-out system. I like it, even if right now it&#039;s working against me (though not really since in practice it hasn&#039;t stopped anyone from dealing with me).

				I&#039;ve had a few auto-finalize cuz i&#039;m International and am used to waiting 21+ days for an order.&nbsp; Every order that went to auto-finalize arrived within days of that.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not my intention to with-hold the vendor from their money, but I can&#039;t release it until it arrives.&nbsp; To start a resolution over a matter that always works itself out within day&#039;s of the auto-finalize seems like a lot of extra work, and the vendor still get&#039;s the money when it auto-finalizes.<br /><br />I&#039;m just being vocal because I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair a vendor cancel all order&#039;s with a buyer who has a bit higher auto-finalize rate.&nbsp; <br />Am I being punished for being patient and not trying to harass the vendor with msgs about &#039;where&#039;s my package, I want it now now now&#039; before a reasonable shipping window (21 days) has elapsed?<br /><br />I mean you no offense Reseller and you are free to run your business however you see fit, I just hope you can see my side of the story.<br /><br />Would a 6% auto-finalize and 3% refund rate on 25 transactions be considered a &#039;questionable&#039; buyer status profile given the 6% auto-finalize?

When the auto-finalize deadline is coming, you can click &quot;resolve&quot; and ask for a deadline extension. Just explain that you live in a remote area and that packages usually take longer to reach you. I&#039;m in the same situation, and a five-day extension is usually more than enough for my packages to arrive safely.<br /><br />The problem with auto-finalize is that most orders arrive long before the auto-finalize deadline, so auto-finalizing is seen as the result of a lazy buyer who doesn&#039;t bother to release the funds when his package arrives, and instead waits for the system to do it automatically.

				I am a relatively new buyer with only 6 sucessful transactions so far.&nbsp; I ordered from our most reputable vender, Pharmville.&nbsp; 12 days passed and it never showed up.&nbsp; No response.&nbsp; I really hope they come back and fix this because I truly care about my buyer statistics.&nbsp; If they refund me I will end up with like a 50 percent refund rate and no one will sell to me.

				So if they don&#039;t return and my package don&#039;t come and my order is about to auto-finalize, what do I do?&nbsp; I hate to pay for something I didn&#039;t get.&nbsp; I&#039;m kinda in a situation.&nbsp; I do trust them, but I also want to protect myself.
