				I want to buy a syringe with needle for IVing. I searched on SR and there&#039;s f*cking NOBODY seelling them to the UK!!! All of the listings for syringes are US to US shipment only!<br /><br />Can anyone point me to a seller who sells syringes to the UK? Or could a vendor who has some sell me one as a custom order? Ideally one with ultrafine needle.

				Do some research for insulin needles and go to the pharmacy and casually ask for some. I&#039;ve gotten some by asking for:<br /><br />BD Ultra-FineTM Needle 8 mm (5/16”) x 31 G (available in 1.0, 0.5 and 0.3mL) <br /><br />in the 1ml size. Write it down on a paper and bring it with you saying you&#039;re buying it for someone.

				There&#039;s a lot of needle exchange programs in the UK where you can anonymously get a free rig as often as you need it. A lot of pharmacies will give them out or at least sell them without asking for ID to practice harm reduction.

				Is it seriously that bad in Europe, next time im at the exchange, probably this afternoon, <br />I might pick up a few ten packs, I&#039;ll send them for free, if you cover postage. I dont know <br />about the legality of sending fits though. We can carry them around without being charged,<br />as long as they are clean, so maybe I can post clean fits also, its just a damn medical supply.<br />Anybody got any ideas on this.<br />

				I am in a state in the US where I can get as many as you want no questions asked. Let me know if you are interested, I can send you my SR username so you can PM me with shipping details and to show you where to send the BTC after receiving the syringes. Let me know what&#039;s up. I can get them as soon as tomorrow and ship them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nbeaupre&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is my username on SR.

				Thanks Jmatts for the offer; my only concern is that it would take longer to arrive from the US than if posted from within the UK. I&#039;ll attempt Recicide&#039;s trick with the phrmacy and try popping round to a needle exchange, and if nothing comes out of it and nobody comes along who can ship from the UK I might drop you a line. on SR.

				UK head here.<br /><br />I picked up a bag of 10x BD Micro-fine 0.5ml U-100 Insulin syringes with needles for a penny under £6, just by going into my local pharmacy and asking for them. I told them it was for a science project on hydrolics (this is my actual family pharmacy and they well know I don&#039;t have diabetes) and they were more than happy to help

				ya lorenz, what i do, or did before i signed up for my local exchange, was.... write it down like regicide said.&nbsp; but i would also write down something like &quot;check prices for glucose meters&quot; then ask the pharmacist something like &quot;whats your cheapest glucose meter&quot; and pretend to be interested in that....kind of look at the meters, maybe say my uncle doesnt have insurance, so i need to find a cheap good one.&nbsp; Then after fucking around, pretending to check prices for a test meter, just be like, i guess i only have enough for the syringes, but ill be back! and just be cool about it like your picking up something for a friend, and no one will say 2 words to you man.<br /><br />i also use to write out the entire details about the syringes wanted too, and tell the pharmacist &quot;i need some of these&quot; and show her the paper.. (BD ultra fine 30 guage, 1cc, 1/2&quot;)

				Customs might not like you trying to smuggle medical supplies out of the USA without paying taxes or declaring the contents of the package. I&#039;m not sure exportation of insulin syringes with needles from USA to UK would be totally legal.
