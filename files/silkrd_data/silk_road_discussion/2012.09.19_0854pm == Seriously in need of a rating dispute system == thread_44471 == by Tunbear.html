				I know I&#039;ve been harping on about this lately, but now it&#039;s costing me a lot of money..<br /><br />Normally I get a minimum of 10, but usually around 30 orders a day. However last few days, some cunts have left a lower rating which has brought me down to a 96 overall, and it is affecting my business.<br /><br />I&#039;ve implemented a banlist because one of these pieces of shit complained that my product wasn&#039;t pure, so to just put it behind I offered a partial refund (not to mention a method to test purity), however he still left a low rating! Told me if I didn&#039;t give him the partial refund he would have give me a 1/5 instead of a 3/5. These selfish pricks don&#039;t realize how much effect their low ratings have.<br /><br />Another user has left me 1/5 with NO REASONING and won&#039;t return my message. Today I had 4 orders, all day, and a few messages questioning my rating saying they didn&#039;t wanna order from me.<br /><br />It&#039;s really frustrating how much power is given to users to fuck over vendors because they&#039;re a bunch of twatting fucking cunting bastards..I was gonna go with something more elegant but no, I reckon that term is perfect.<br /><br />Yes this is me venting but also a valid point to bring up

				First off, doesn&#039;t look like his account is suspended in any way.&nbsp; He took down his listings himself.<br /><br />Second, you&#039;re a piece of shit scammer trying to scam a legit vendor.&nbsp; You fucked up.&nbsp; Plain and simple.&nbsp; You FE&#039;ed, you used someone else&#039;s money, and you&#039;re continuing to be a little bitch about the situation.&nbsp; Aakoven is a legit vendor and one of the longest around, and I highly doubt he&#039;d scam anyone.&nbsp; But after how long he&#039;s been here, he has his policy regarding shit for a reason.&nbsp; He even warns how risky it is to send to the US.&nbsp; &nbsp;So unless you got a customs letter saying it got seized, you&#039;re just shit out of luck.&nbsp; And frankly, it&#039;s idiots like you who are ruining this place.&nbsp; Quit bein&#039; a little bitch and learn from it.
