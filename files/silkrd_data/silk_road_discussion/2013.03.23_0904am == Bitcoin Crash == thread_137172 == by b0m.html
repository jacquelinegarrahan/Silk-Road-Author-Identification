				It wasn&#039;t fundamentally sound at above $70 to begin with in my opinion. People have recently rushed into bitcoin, especially since we reached our past high around $30. Its just been greed pushing the price up recently, I think we&#039;ll probably see it stabalize somwhere from $30-45 for the near future, and then see some organic growth follow that. <br /><br />I still believe bitcoin has potential to go above $100. It will take time, patience, and most importantly, ORGANIC growth, not this crazy parabolic growth happening right now. Its just unsustainable.

				I know, it has just dropped so quickly, thank god I cashed out when I did. I can&#039;t see anything in the news like theft, technical errors or anything like that so I guess it is essentially a value correction from a large sell-off.<br /><br />Who knows, value may return in a few hours, it has been very unstable for about 6 hours though.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Feeling sick watching it fall, much nicer when it&#039;s the other way. I just hope it settles at something decent like $35-$40 - at least above what I paid for them. really not much you can do now, if it&#039;s crashing it&#039;s crashing. By the time I&#039;d have chased out it wouldn&#039;t be worth it. <br />

				Don&#039;t freak out! A couple people with a lot probably realized they could retire right now and never work another day in their life! But there is a stable market and people want bitcoins so it will balance back out as long as people want them. If every hoarder cashed out right now freaking out about them failing and crashing to pennies, they would crash all the way down. So don&#039;t jump ship, hold fast and the value will hold too. The same thing happened with silver back in the 80&#039;s, if someone had enough to manipulate the market, they could just be playing all of us and making money on fear.

				What exactly happened? Last night it was at around $175. This morning it was around $161, but it&#039;s gone up since then. How low did it drop?<br /><br />I&#039;m not nearly educated enough to speculate meaningfully about these things, but it seems like it&#039;s just correcting itself after the 2 days or INSANE growth, bringing it back into line with the steady (although very fast) growth we&#039;d got used to. Is this likely/unlikely/stupid?

				IMO the speculators are inflating the price.&nbsp; yes, we all know that bitcoin is a finite resource and designed to be deflationary, but currently all they&#039;re really good for is A)&nbsp; Drugs&nbsp; B)&nbsp; crappy gambling games&nbsp; and C) cashing them out for gov&#039;t currencies.&nbsp; i think it will certainly continue to grow in the long run, but right now they just aren&#039;t worth the current exchange rate, IMO.

				phew. its actually still 51€. i had to sell it in the morning. i thought they will fall to zero. and i HAD to think that as they fell in the 5 minute range about ~5€. heck there were people buying them for 56€, i clicked them to sell and they were sold already. i clicked the next one at 55.50 and sold, clicked next one at 53 - sold - clicked 51 - sold. i thought WTF in 5 minutes i lost ~100€ - then had luck and sold for 49,50. i look at the rates and they were on 40€ already ffs. then strangely how the rates didnt update for 20 minutes and then it was 47€ again. i really had to think they will fall to zero. i thought there was some kind of hack or so as everyone sold them in big chunks... really wish i had read PrincessHIGH post before as that was something which i thought was possible too. but i told myself as soon as i see them under 50 i will sell. and that happened in no time so it was the smartest thing to do really as i couldnt figure why that would happen. it must have happened something to the bitcoin i thought.... well anyway i bought them for 15€ so still a pretty decent profit. i just have to think i trippled my money to not fall into depressions the next days :D&nbsp; BIG headache now... going to chill and forget about bitcoins...

				My prediction is that since it didn&#039;t plummet that much, and it has stabled off, is that now people will start buying up the cheaper coins again.&nbsp; &nbsp;( when it was over 70 I am sure the buying slowed down ).<br /><br />But if the past is any indication, coins are going to continue to rise, followed by short falls.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The need for coins is only going to go up,&nbsp; it isn&#039;t like over night people decided to leave these things alone.<br /><br />Hold on to your coins,&nbsp; even if they fall more, it will turn around and start heading up again.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Just jumping in here rather than put up a thread. <br /><br />Whats the best way to buy btc (UK) directly or a way that allows me to at least buy coins as soon as I see a value change, rather than wait for btc vendors to come through which can be up to 2 days and in which time I&#039;m loosing money all the time?<br /><br /><br />Thanks.

				It seems logical to ride out any fluctuation and keep your investment in BTC- just like the NASDAQ, there will be ups and downs, but the theory is have faith that the market will keep increasing in volume&nbsp; over the long term. It seems like the long term pattern is up up up! <br /><br />I would love to see the few BTC I have go up above 100 USD a piece.. or higher&nbsp; 8) It&#039;s not like it will make or break me even if it does crash or destabilize.

				I bought a bulk order from a very well known top seller. The order was placed in january 8 and it just ended today when i decided to release funds ( even though one package is still yet to arrive) for him since btc was going lower. The amount was 156 btc and it was hedged, it was worth around 2.2k usd back in january like 14usd/btc . So now he got 9k atleast. <br />Lucky him!

				Well I still maintain there was no &#039;crash&#039;. A crash would imply that there was some kind of stability beforehand from whence it crashed. There was not, It went from $40 to $70 almost overnight and then briefly above $80. Since then it has hovered around $70. This is not what I&#039;d call a good investment climate as it&#039;s simply to volatile.&nbsp; You&#039;d have to be a gambling cowboy to throw any real money into this. If you already have some BtC laying around I&#039;d keep em and just let it ride. If you need more BtC&#039;s for an SR order then go out and buy em and spend em right away. <br />

				Thats easy to say if u r not sitting on a lot of bitcoins. u can never know what happened to cause the crash. it might got hacked right now and is worth basically nothing in a matter of hours. the smartest thing to do in such a situation is just to sell em as expensive as possible in my opinion. Holding on to them in that situation is really a gamble.

				Hold fast and trust in it and it will survive. Panic selling will hurt everyone! I wonder how much money was lost because someone freaked out when it was around $50 and now are kicking themselves since it is back where it was! When it dropped, I didn&#039;t think about selling, I wanted to buy as many at 50 as I could! Too bad I didn&#039;t have the money to do it as most of my money is tied up in a few hundred bitcoins. This is likely some bit rich person playing all of your fears, make the price drop, then when everyone freaks out and starts selling them cheap in a panic, buy all the coins you can! This has happened with silver and it will continue to happen with bitcoins as long as people are running scared every time the price drops $10

				I have a feeling there will be a crash again then prices will drop, so I bought what I needed now (10 btc) plus the vendor in question gave me an excellent deal so for the sake of possibly making a couple of hundred extra over the next few weeks I decided to buy what I needed at a good price and the product is now sold out I bought the last so I would rather have top quality right now than double the product but weaker quality. <br /><br />I just have a feeling there be will crash again, dont know why, I will more than likely be wrong, but I am trusting my gut here and I got a good deal so Im happy what ever happens.<br /><br />
