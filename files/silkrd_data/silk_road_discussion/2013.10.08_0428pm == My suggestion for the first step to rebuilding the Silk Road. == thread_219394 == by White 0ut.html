				Step fucking #1. <br /><br />We are going to have to establish a wallet address for donations; dedicated servers that are overseas cost money. Not to mention I&#039;m sure whatever crew, if any associated with DPR has been left fairly broke, like the rest of us<br /><br />We need to find out an authentic person who is solely in charge of getting the road back up, then we need to invest time, BTC, and trust in this person. <br /><br />I see that a new DPR has taken upon the new forums, this is great but I will need more than a username and picture to put my money and trust into...<br /><br />We don&#039;t have very many mods/OG vendors left, so what we need to do is vest all of our efforts into one centralized approved figure. <br /><br />Who will this person be?<br /><br />What affiliation to the original SR/DPR did they have?<br /><br />What are their beliefs and how do they relate to our original charter?<br /><br />So we need to find this person, the lone light that will shine through what is now a governmental cave of hell. <br /><br />-The demand is still there.<br />-The resources are still there to make an operational site<br />-The community is still here<br /><br />What this person needs to do is make a VIP list of members and make it invite only for at least a few months until we can observe the full reasoning behind the takedown and how it actually happened... Then we can truly learn and rebuild...<br /><br />Look, free markets have been around forever even since the first bazaars in the middle east long ago. <br /><br />Let&#039;s get an exclusive ground group together, united under one person (the next DPR) and get this show back on the road.<br /><br />We can conduct business and deals privately using an invite only method at first....<br /><br />Honestly, someone with some respect, authority, and experience needs to step up. Publicly announce this, get some backing from legitimate sources that prove your credibility as the next DPR, get a wallet set up, get some international servers, and let&#039;s get back to business!<br /><br />Can anyone see what I am pushing at here?<br />

				Post from my guide to Silk Road...<br /><br />&quot;To all of you wonderful Silk Road, well (former) Silk Road users who took the time to say thanks here or even read what I had to say..<br /><br />-Thank You...<br /><br />Silk Road and it&#039;s amazing people, you people, have helped me through things in my life that are unimaginable to most.<br /><br />DPR, I salute you. Whether justified or not, your actions took place, and the site is now down. Yes. There will be another, but there will never be a community like we had. It was something special, Oh how I will miss Jack, Purple Lotus, Princess High, FuckingAce, Trashbox, &amp; the rest of the crew. Hell I even imagine coachella will cross my mind every now and then! Regardless of who reads this, or how far we continue as a whole I love you all very much and each and every one of you will hold a deep spot in my heart for many years to come!<br /><br />I have changed the way I think, my beliefs, and my overall life style thanks to what I have learned here, it can only make one a better person. I will be sure to apply it to my life how I see fit!<br /><br />You all are really a great crew of people, please everyone rejoice, for we were part of something miraculous, something that is far from dead and something that will continue, in what I hope will be the path of prosperity that we were on.<br /><br />I look forward to getting to know you all, not physically, but spiritually. I hope you can all tune your minds in to me &amp; wonder how I am doing every now and again.<br /><br />Fuck I&#039;m going to miss this, you guys, and Silk Road in general.<br /><br />FUCK THE POLICE!&quot;<br />
