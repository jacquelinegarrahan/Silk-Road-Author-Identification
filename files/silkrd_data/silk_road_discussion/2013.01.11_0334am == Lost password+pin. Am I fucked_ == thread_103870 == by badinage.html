				I changed my password and PIN on my silk road account right before transferring bitcoins to it (as the buyers guide recommends doing).&nbsp; I saved the password and PIN to a text document.&nbsp; I had the original password and pin saved in text documents that were saved in a password protected RAR file.&nbsp; I delete the text file after logging in to silk road so that the only copy is in the rar file.&nbsp; I forgot to rezip the edited document with the changed password and pin and deleted the document as I usually do.&nbsp; I&#039;m a dumbass.&nbsp; Who do I contact about this?&nbsp; Please tell me I didn&#039;t fuck myself out of the bitcoins I just transferred :(<br /><br />I have tried using a few file recovery programs to no avail.

				UPDATE:&nbsp; I opened silk road on my phone and my account with my bitcoins on it is still logged in!&nbsp; However I still don&#039;t know my pass/pin.&nbsp; How do I go about getting these reset?&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to find the answer quickly in case I get logged out on my phone for some reason.<br /><br />Thank you!

				Contact SR admins, but bear in mind its just as possible that someone is pretending to be you, with this forum account, and trying to gain access to an account that just had btc moved into it. You dont remember PW/PIN? I don&#039;t even keep mine in any format outside my brain, feels least likely to ever be connectable to me.<br />
