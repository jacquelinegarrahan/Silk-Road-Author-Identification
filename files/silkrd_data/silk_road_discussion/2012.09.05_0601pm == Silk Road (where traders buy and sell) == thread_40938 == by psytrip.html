This route brought closer various religions, people, technologies and philosophies and was a major trade route for the &quot;Old World&quot;.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to the &quot;New World&quot;<br /><br /><br />In this World people come across various religions, technologies and philosophies to buy and sell SUBSTANCES those some times enhance consciousness, bring closer to a new world with &quot;Doors of perception&quot; wide open. This New World is different from the Old World(Silk Road) in many aspects. The trade was done on mules, camels and Yaks, whereas here it is done through a completely secure system of PGP&#039;s, Bitcoins and Internet. We, the members of SR community should do every bit to secure all the transactions, and make this community a breakthrough to the New World.
