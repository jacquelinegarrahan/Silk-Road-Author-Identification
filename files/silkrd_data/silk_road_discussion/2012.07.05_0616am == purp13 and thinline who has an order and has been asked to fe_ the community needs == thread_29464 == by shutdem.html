				so who all has a order in with thinline? supposed to be purp13&#039;s partner.&nbsp; Now purp saying he ran off with his equiptment. i got a message from him saying that thinline told him his wife flipped out and threw out his equipment. Now, purp wants &quot;everyone&quot; who has a order in with them? Do you think this is a bit odd? i mean purp has id listed on his page and has even when thinline started.&nbsp; So, my question is anyone in this situation, what are you going to do? do you think this sounds right? to finalize early so he can buy new equiptment? i mean anyone who has a order. now we are talking there has to be 25 people who ordered and that all of them to fe for him to get the $1400 he claims he needs to get more equipiment to do all the ids!?!?<br />let me know what is going on vets. newbies anyone with a order.<br /><br />thank you in advance<br />we have to stick together as a community&nbsp; lets get this going to see whats going on

				This belongs in the Rumor Mill, not in general discussion. You will get more helpful responses if you post this where it actually belongs. Obviously none of this sounds right, but to be honest I&#039;m not completely sure I understand what you&#039;re saying. You could have made this post a little more clear.

				to better clearify this is the email i got. It is purp13 logged in under his partners account. He is saying that he taught him everything he knows. and gave him his equiptment and not the guys wife threw it away, purp also has something like that on his page it says that his partner ran off with it. so? Anyone have a order with him? I do! and Trust me guys i already know i am not fe for anything! I mean my stats are great 0% return and more than enough transactions! So, this sounds kinda fishy if you know what i mean! but i want people with a order to log on and search thinline and see this and comment on what they were told. but yeah he is saying he needs everyone to FE so he can buy equiptment again and too trust him, but since thinline his partner has signed on, Well purp13 never took down his listins for ids for a greater price. So, how could he complete them without the nessasary equiptment? anyway. here is the email. anyone with a pending order with thinline/purp13<br /><br /><br />thinline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject<br /><br />I would like to start this off by notifying you are speaking with purp13 right now thinline is no longer in business with me.<br />My profile can be found here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/1a2c8b2c96 I started this ID business for thinline and taught him how to do it but now he&#039;s telling me that his wife freaked out and threw everything out yet he can&#039;t find it.<br /><br />Not sure what actually happened and I don&#039;t care much about the kid to get into it with him.<br /><br /><br /><br />I will be taking over the business and finish all the orders for him I will cancel this account once that&#039;s finished and switch it over to my purp13 account since my associate is gone.<br /><br /><br />My proposal is I need about 1400$ to buy my supplies again if you could finalize this order put your trust in me I will use that money to buy new supplies and I will finish your order and then send back 25$ as well through SR so that you will have only paid 50$ for your ID.<br /><br />If not I can cancel your order it&#039;s not a problem I do apologize for this my partner was not as trustworthy as I had thought.<br /><br />If you want I can cancel the order and you can place the order through my purp13 account if that earns any more trust either.<br /><br />Just let me know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />now also if he needs money how the hell is he going to give the $25 back with the id? i mean there is 0 transactions. So, it would mean he has to have over 25 orders pending for this to even be close to possible???? I mean i dont want to call bs. but i am saying just doesnt sound right and anyone with a order give the community some feedback<br />thank you in advance!<br />

				I can&#039;t explain to you what is currently going on; however, I can tell you that I have successfully ordered an ID from purp13.&nbsp; He DOES make decent quality IDs.&nbsp; He took a little while for me, but he came through.&nbsp; He is legit; now whatever is going on with this drama--I have absolutely no idea.&nbsp; Just wanted to chime in and say purp13 is LEGIT and DOES make IDs.

				trust me guys i am not nor do i ever fe unless i have many purchases with a vendor and then still its rare unless its large amount and they need the money because the coins are depreciating or something to that effect! Now i appreciate your input and I see someone tomleepdx i believe said purp13 does quality ids. that is great if he does and i would like one but ill be damned if i am getting scammed out of money, if he is on top of his game then he shouldnt need to fe! that was not part of the agreement, I just dont understand he said he has soo many orders waiting in this same situation,&nbsp; If you are in this siuation please let me and the community know what is going on<br />we all thank you in adcanve<br />sincerely<br />shutdem
