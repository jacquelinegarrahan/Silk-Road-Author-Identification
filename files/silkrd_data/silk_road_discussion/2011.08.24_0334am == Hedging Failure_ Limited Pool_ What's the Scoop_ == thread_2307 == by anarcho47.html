				So I have had my account as hedged since the very first day it became an option.&nbsp; Peace of mind and more accurate forecasting are far more important to me than potential gains or losses, adding another layer of speculation to SR.<br /><br />However, my latest transactions to clear all came in substantially lower than the hedged value, actually lower than I would have gotten F2F and just barely eking me out a profit.&nbsp; Has SR unofficially cut hedging (I&#039;m still active, but my latest orders are all hedged BTC, NOT USD).&nbsp; I would like to get a response on this so I can adjust my sales methods accordingly.&nbsp; I will probably have to start doing everything over 1/8 as an out-of-escrow transaction if this is the case as I have had a bad run on SR while I was on vacation, and am still licking my wounds from that.<br /><br />Anybody else noticing this or am i the only one?&nbsp; Or is the hedge pool vastly diminished and is it now a first-come-first-serve basis?&nbsp; Just wanting some clarity so I can adjust the game plan.

				Are you sure it wasn&#039;t the buy/sell difference that SR uses? I know that when I hedged, the buy/sell difference was quite a bit. So much so that I have discovered that hedging (while in theory a good idea) does not work well for me. For example if i hedged something that I put up for 50 bucks and the buyer clicked received, I would only get about 48 bucks because of the way hedging works (the bitcoin didn&#039;t move a cent). Now, if the bitcoin drops like a rock like it has been known to do, well, thats when hedging will save your rear end.<br /><br />I know when I first hedged, I had SR explain why there was a difference and it was explained to me like any forex type deal, Or mt. gox/trade hill transaction. you always have a buy&nbsp; and a sell price. When Its hedged I guess there is a hedge/non hedged price. To me, I will risk the volitility of the bitcoin market rather than hedge. I consider it expensive insurance, lol. Its still great that it&#039;s available, I just wish it was a little cheaper and had the ability to chose which products you want to hedge rather than hedge everything or not...

				What I&#039;m saying is that I have hedging active on my account but all of my current orders are just in BTC Escrow - not being hedged at all.<br /><br />I&#039;m just wondering if the major hit (I&#039;m not sure if there are put options to hedge against long exposure on BTC yet) wiped out the hedge pool but nobody&#039;s said anything...
