				*Edit* Poor title, I meant only people who canceled orders.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be upfront. I think we should. I agree that the vendors have the ability to pull listings if bitcoin goes down. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s right but they do have that ability. Shouldn&#039;t we, as a community, value those vendors that didn&#039;t? I think yes.<br /><br />I think an easy and effective way to show that we value them would be to make a list of those that did pull listings as the value started to drop. Alternatively, we could make a list of known vendors that still did ship. Either way, it achieves the same goal. I&#039;m not saying we say &quot;NEVER BUY FROM THIS GUY AGAIN!!!&quot; I&#039;m saying we say &quot;Ok this guy is known to pull listings if bitcoin prices drop so be careful if the market is volatile&quot;<br /><br />Vendors would be more than welcome to explain why they may have pulled listings. I think we can all agree that having more vendors that honor prices whether they go up or down would benefit the community, so why don&#039;t we do something about it?<br /><br />This is bigger than me or my story, it&#039;s about how we want this community to work in the future. We know for a face there are going to be bitcoin fluxuations in future, and really SR doesn&#039;t offer much protection to buyers in these cases so it seems to me that our only recourse is to take matters into our own hands.<br /><br />Let me know what you think.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				It&#039;s their product. If they decide to randomly pull all listings, and cram every ouch of illegal matter into their anal orifice, they have that right. Your crying about not getting cheap drugs.<br /><br />All this scary talk about lists, you know we have a vendors black list?<br /><br />HOW DARE THAT FUCKING VENDOR CANCEL MY ORDER, I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT GRAM OF COKE FOR $5. THE NERVE OF THAT MOTHERFUCKER! GO BACK TO YOUR FUCKING GIANT YACHT AND HOT MODEL GIRLFRIENDS VENDOR!

				I think I agree with the vendors that pulling listings is ok.&nbsp; However if a vendor cancels an order I think that should be discussed in length and added to some sort of list.

				Interesting question.... I&#039;d say it&#039;s their right and only a fool would fault them for it... but then when bitcoins are jumping sky high, they&#039;re making a killing, and buyers aren&#039;t able to cancel for 4 days.... So I&#039;d argue that if you think it&#039;s ok for vendors to cancel orders cause bitcoins are falling, then you should support giving buyers the right to immediately cancel all the way up to the time it ships in case bitcoins are climbing.<br /><br />I think the reality is that any vendor knee jerking their listings and orders are going to quickly find their business evaporating because the truth is that the days of bitcoins regularity are over. every day now on mtgox the volume of trades has been increasing... what used to be a volume of 20k bitcoins a day is now a volume of 250k bitcoins a day, and thats just the trade in USD... as such the value of bitcoins will most likely continue to be incredibly unstable. Big investors are in on it now and with no regulation, they can sell large amounts at high prices, cause the price to drop, then buy a ton at the new low price, causing it to climb, rinse and repeat. Any smart vendor will ignore the bitcoin value on day to day transactions, and set a baseline for turning bitcoins into cash that they exchange every time the value hits that number. They should be thinking long term, not short term.

				And that&#039;s really the point Sam, why would you ever do that? Why not pull all your listings and cancel orders? It&#039;s well within your rights as a vendor to do that. I&#039;m gonna to guess your answer be will something about keeping your customer base (could be wrong), but if you sold something that had a larger customer base say weed then it probably wouldn&#039;t matter as much. Maybe you&#039;re a nice guy and it would matter to you Sam, but I imagine to some people it doesn&#039;t. Just saying their should be something in place so at least you get some benefit from getting screwed over by honoring your current orders.

				Vendors are well within their rights to pull listings in a volatile market. If the BTC value shoots up and then takes a dive then it&#039;s just good business sense to protect yourself, because a few large transactions could put the vendor who doesn&#039;t have a lot of capital out of business.<br /><br />The tricky thing is honoring orders that have already been placed, and dealing with each situation in a tactful way. I highly respect vendors like SamG who honored those orders, and don&#039;t blame him in the least for pulling them temporarily until certain issues are ironed out. It&#039;s his choice.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently in the middle of a similar situation: I placed an order for two items on Monday evening, when the BTC value was hovering around where Mt. Gox currently has the weighted average pegged to. I figured that it was going up even higher, but I knew from experience that it would also fall back to a more reasonable rate, for myriad reasons. I didn&#039;t want to wait until it reached higher and higher, because I was concerned about having my order cancelled.<br /><br />My two orders are still in the &#039;processing&#039; stage. I recently inquired about the status of my order and I&#039;m waiting to hear back. I hope my order isn&#039;t cancelled outright and that the vendor sees that my order wasn&#039;t placed anywhere near the peak, but the length of time that my orders have sat in limbo worries me a bit. I have plenty of flawless transactions under my belt but this is the first order with this particular vendor. Either way I&#039;ve never bad-mouthed a vendor and I don&#039;t plan to start; by the same token I don&#039;t like that my BTC have been tied up all week. I would still never call out a vendor unless I was taken advantage of and felt an obligation to warn other buyers.<br /><br />Vendors need the benefit of the doubt in this situation. I&#039;ve been on the other side of the fence in a previous life and something like this could have disastrous results to a business. I simply expect a clear line of communication. If the vendor is doing something that doesn&#039;t appear to be good for the customer... Well, that&#039;s why we have these forums!<br /><br />I think that most buyers would agree that they&#039;d rather lose a really good sale than lose a really good vendor. At least that&#039;s how I see it.&nbsp; :)

				Buyers were doing the same thing when BTC was increasing. They stopped buying. They basically pulled their buy orders.<br /><br />Should vendors black list buyers who didn&#039;t buy?<br /><br />It&#039;s a free market and you can do what you want.

				Come On man...how could you expect a vendor to keep selling knowing he is gonna lose money.&nbsp; Your thought process is messed up friend.&nbsp; The last I checked, people sell drugs to make money, and I&#039;m pretty sure that applies to streets and online.<br /><br />Now cancelling an order from before any sign of a drop is up for debate.&nbsp; The way I see it.....With the amount of extra money the vendors have been making on btc uphill run.....they can afford to take a small hit on a few orders.&nbsp; I think it would be a pretty shady move to cancel an order from the day before and fuck a buyer who might not have any money at all.&nbsp; Thats just me.<br /><br />I made a big order the day before and my vendor still shipped during the downward spiral.&nbsp; So I gotta say I have one of the good ones.

				I would be pissed if I had a order sitting the last couple days and it was canceled. Dealers haves every right to pull listing though. And yes some dealers would be screwed with the lower amount of BTC now, but what happens when the btc goes up again they will still have the btc unless they freak out and sell out at the bottom. Its like people who buy stocks sometimes you buy low and the price rises and sell, then other times you miss the top and have to hold. <br />I dont know just my two cents. I would not be surpised if this drop was not caused by some of the dealers here dropping mass amounts of btc into the market to try and cash in on the record highs.

				I show up after the crash is over and find that buyers bought all my inventory to unload their bitcoins and covert them into product so they wouldn&#039;t be screwed. I am honoring all those orders even though I&#039;m losing money six ways from Sunday. I am pulling my listing now and going on vacation until the bitcoin stabilizes. All orders made today will ship tomorrow Friday April 12, 2013. Also, all orders that were made today were hedged so nobody is losing anything so no reason to freak out.<br /><br />If you were looking to invest in bitcoins now is time, buy low sell high is how the market works. Bitcoins will go up from here on out so buy now.<br />

I think yes.<br /><br />I think an easy and effective way to show that we value them would be to make a list of those that did pull listings as the value started to drop. Alternatively, we could make a list of known vendors that still did ship. Either way, it achieves the same goal. I&#039;m not saying we say &quot;NEVER BUY FROM THIS GUY AGAIN!!!&quot; I&#039;m saying we say &quot;Ok this guy is known to pull listings if bitcoin prices drop so be careful if the market is volatile&quot;<br /><br />Vendors would be more than welcome to explain why they may have pulled listings. I think we can all agree that having more vendors that honor prices whether they go up or down would benefit the community, so why don&#039;t we do something about it?<br /><br />This is bigger than me or my story, it&#039;s about how we want this community to work in the future. We know for a face there are going to be bitcoin fluxuations in future, and really SR doesn&#039;t offer much protection to buyers in these cases so it seems to me that our only recourse is to take matters into our own hands.<br /><br />Let me know what you think.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am a vendor and I have kept my listings up.

There is nothing you can do except never order from them.<br />

Remember, without vendors there is no Silk Road.

				To the OP - that is outrageous. You want vendors to go into massive loss? Get out of here dude. Did you have a problem when BTC was going up? NO. But you want vendors to honor listings that could lose them their ass? Vendors are the backbone of this entire place. Why would you want to hurt their bottom line?

				As a buyer, I&#039;m siding with all of the vendors here. They should have the right to pull supply AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON, without question or acknowledgement, imo. <br /><br />Cancelling placed orders on the other hand is an entirely different story, as I feel it is the vendor&#039;s responsibility to take the listing out before orders can be placed. Cancelling orders can just as equally screw over buyers. <br /><br />If anything, praise the vendors who left their listings up and honored all orders placed, but not the other way around. And even this seems like more of a hassle than it&#039;s worth.

				AfterHour cancelled my order 12 hours after I placed it. I spent €200 ($260) for a bitcoin to buy his product and he completely screwed me over. I asked him nicely what happened and he gave me no satisfaction, writing in caps and acting like a child. <br /><br />No this isn&#039;t a legitimate legal market like eBay. But at least have the decency to keep your word. If you have listings up then honour the agreement we made in the transaction. It&#039;s neither the vendor nor the buyers fault for the market crash but we all suffer together. <br /><br />My business is going to another vendor as I&#039;m being coerced. This wouldn&#039;t be a problem but I had a big choice of vendors and I chose AfterHours as he clearly had his listings up. Then he cancels and my coins drop a fifth in value. If he at least explained what happened nicely I would be fine with it. Someone said earlier that the vendors are the backbone of this site. Sorry but it&#039;s the buyers that fund the market. Without customers you don&#039;t have a business. I believe the customer is not always right but this time I was fucked over.

				Of course this is a free market and I respect the right of anyone to withdraw listing at any time for any reason, but vendors have been cashing out often double profits for the past months now. Many of them will have made an absolute killing. G-Analytics shows that some of the top vendors profits increased by 120%. PROFITS increased by that much.<br /><br />I have a lot of respect for those vendors that have been making a killing, and chose to still honor their orders that were placed yesterday. It&#039;s not just vendors that lose out here. It&#039;s buyers too. Every single buyer that bought coins at above the current price, loses out (unless they go up again), and that&#039;s a lot of people.<br /><br />What I have absolutely no respect for, is vendors that are currently saying things like &quot;Pulled listings due to price drop, however I will honor all orders made during this time &quot; on their profile page, then canceling those very orders. I just had weedmanuk pull this shit on me. Profile page says one thing, my inbox says another.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to cancel orders, that&#039;s fine, just be honest about it. Don&#039;t say one thing on your profile page then stab your customers in the back via PM.<br /><br /><br />

				I didnt pull my listings I GOT WIPED OUT ha ha ;D. On Wednesday i got&nbsp; wiped out and made huge losses but the two weeks running up to the crash i will be honest people who left there payment go to auto finalize i made a killing on that. So the way i look at it you take a good with the bad and no once did i think about canceling the orders even tho most were below cost price.

				As I mentioned in the other thread there has been instances in the past week when you could place an order in the evening and wake up to find that order would have cost you half of what you paid for it before you went to bed. And to makes things even worse, it hasn&#039;t even been shipped. <br /><br />Having to wait 4 days as a customer before I can cancel an order is far too long during these volatile times. <br /><br />Yes, Im sure some dealers have lost out in the past 24hrs but its a drop in the ocean to what the vendors with brains will have made in the couple of weeks leading upto the crash. <br /><br />You didn&#039;t really think it could keep on rising at those levels..

				I messaged a vendor and asked them if there was a chance they might cancel the order I wanted to place because I saw they were unhedged, and there was a competitor who was hedged who I would have gone with in such a case. They told me they would not cancel but I didn&#039;t give them enough time to reply and I went with the hedged guy before hearing back because I happen to be a nervous, jumpy twat. But I would have gone with the first man if I&#039;d heard back from him in time. Either way, I saw the situation and thought, why not simply ask first?

				Full disclosure, I just lost some money because of vendors cancelling my orders, and now my 4/20 plans are in limbo. Vendors have every right to pull listings or cancel orders, but I sure as shit ain&#039;t doing business with the people who screwed me over ever again. A blacklist of cancelling vendors sounds a little over the top to me, but my heart doesn&#039;t exactly go out to any vendors who get called out over it. <br /><br />The cornerstone of a free market is freedom of information. If I&#039;d lost serious money like some people have, I&#039;d definitely be naming and shaming and shitting all over their review threads. As it is, not really worth the trouble.

Some drug dealers might hound you in ways you might not like. They have your address after all. Don&#039;t kid yourself and think that as soon as they mark it shipped your address info is ether. They likely hold onto it until you finalize in case you pull some stunt they can throw the address back at you and show you how you submitted it.&nbsp; <br /><br />No, buyer cancellation after 4 days stays. Shorter and 90% of vendors would leave. OR mark orders in transit on day one, ship on day 3 or 4. Or day 7. Or 8. The 4 days is there to give the seller time to ship. <br /><br />You can&#039;t win.

				in fact, the more I think about it the worse it seems!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some of the more financially astute SR members will know about futures and options.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A future is a contract where A and B agree to exchange x amount of (commodity a) for y amount of (commodity b) at a set date in the future. It is a kind of gamble; A thinks the relative values of a and b will go one way, B thinks the opposite. when the time comes for completion, one will profit, the other will lose.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An option is similar, except as the name suggests the trade is not compulsory:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A sells B the option to exchange x for y at set date in future, However B is under no compulsion to do so; he will only make the trade if it is advantageous to him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The benefit to A is that he SELLS the option, basing the price on his estimate of the likely movement of relative price of a and b in mean time.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;under SRs current system, the buyer is GIVING the vendor an option to exchange x amount of drugs for y BTC, at anytime in the next four days that may seem best to the vendor.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even worse, until the vendor decides whether the trade will benefit him, he can tie up the buyers BTC. If he should decide the trade is not to his liking, he can return the buyers BTC.

				Dear Sirs,<br /><br />I think that its perfectly reasonable for sellers to make decisions based upon the market value, i dont think you guys realize how much money we&#039;ve lost because of this crash, I wont be pulling out any orders but i may consider raising my prices, the products are still very cheap, but if you want to be apart of the community then support your vendors, we&#039;re providing you the best service we can even when we&#039;re taking a loss be grateful for tht.<br /><br />&nbsp;SunWu

				On Monday I put in an order from a reputable vendor for a 50 hits of LSD, they didn&#039;t get it out or mark it as shipped yet. Today they removed all their listings. Hopefully they come through, they&#039;ve made quite a presence here on SR which is why I ordered from them and I&#039;m pretty worried that I&#039;ll have lost all my BTC if they cancel.

				The fact is these sellers, myself included, decided to sell unhedged and play the market, they made lots of money in a few days and are all still very much ahead if they have been doing this for any amount of time. No one is going hungry because of this, each bitcoin is still worth more then it was 2 weeks ago, so if they are going to profit on the gain, they should loose on the fall. Pull your listings any time, but a sale should be honored. I have over 2500 in product in escrow that I will get less then 1k for, but I never stopped taking orders. There have been plenty of times that I had 1500 worth of orders in escrow and collected 2500, so I feel it should swing both ways, that is the way of life.<br /><br />No list for those that pulled their listings, but there could be a heroes list of those that stuck around and honored sales.<br /><br />There should Absolutely be a list for sellers that cancel, they are not good for the community and I would personally avoid them with my buyer account.<br /><br />That&#039;s the opinion of this seller and buyer!

The Hedged version was how I thought *all* sales were executed on SR. So I placed a couple orders when BTC was around $100, but didn&#039;t end up finalizing until a few days later, when coins were almost double. So those vendors, if the sales were unhedged (and I believe they were) really made out assuming they cashed in the coins quickly.<br /><br />That I didn&#039;t get. I think that alters my opinion a bit. I still think vendors should be able to pull a listing at any time, but probably should be fulfilling orders regardless.

				I think there&#039;s some misunderstanding here (or maybe it&#039;s mine!). The problem for vendors with this crash was not hedging/unhedging. The problem was that SR was saying BTCs were worth, for example, $120, when you&#039;d actually only get $60 upon cashing out. Hedging could not protect from this, because it was hedged to SR&#039;s approximation of the value of Bitcoin, which was for some time much much higher than the actual value of Bitcoin.<br /><br />Jesus of Rave has explained what happened to him/them in their thread in the Product Offers section, and they explain it much better than me. I&#039;m not sure about the rights and wrongs of cancelling orders, I haven&#039;t thought about it that much and was lucky enough to have spent all my coins last week. But it seems to me that temporarily pulling listings when you are only receiving half of the money for each sale you make is a completely reasonable response, at the very least until you can get your head round the situation.

				Why do so many people complain about how SR values the btc. How they do it is PERFECT! As perfect as it is ever going to get. THEY ARE NOT SLOW. They do the exact same thing they have done for over 1 year.&nbsp; In the exact time frame! It is a 24 hour average and the way they do it...helps ALL members...not just the vendors...but the buyers as well.<br /><br />When you guys go to Mt.Gox and see it is $150 per coin then you come to SR and see it is $120 or even $220 that is just fine. In fact it is PERFECT. It is as perfect a system as you can get. The fact is SR uses a 24 hour weighted average. And that is GREAT for the buyers. It allows you to know where the coin value is going to be. And it is great for vendors to as you have the same information. There is NOTHING wrong with a vendor pulling listings. NOTHING. How anyone does not understand stand this just go&#039;s to show you how stupid people are in these forums. If SR was to update every minute or even 5 minutes as Mt.Gox does it would be terrible for SR. In fact it is ludicrous to even bring that up..so I will move on. That would/will never happen and all of you should understand why that is a good thing.<br /><br />The fact is 99% of buyers only buy BTC so they can then buy drugs on SR. And if you have any kind of smarts...like an IQ over 90... you will never lose any money on the btc. And if you are smart enough to purchase your coins from someone that sell them to you at the current SR rate and not the Mt.Gox rate...then you will always have it good. Meaning you pay for the btc at $90 per coin...then you make a purchase on SR at $90 per coin. Bingo..you just used the btc wahat it was meant for on SR. To buy drugs.<br /><br />There have been WAY MORE buyers that have paid for an item at the rate of $120 per coin...THEN the btc go&#039;s up to $150 per coin and they try and get the vendor to cancel the order so they can reorder at the higher price. That is laughable. And it is one of the reasons you as a buyer can not cancel an order until the 4 day mark...if in fact the vendor has not shipped your item.&nbsp; That has happened a lot more then vendors cancelling orders because of the btc crashing.<br /><br />The problem that people should be talking about is what if a vendor cancels an order on you because the BTC has dived. Well the truth is they should not do that. If they do you should be pissed and you should never buy from them again. On the other hand if you bought a pound of weed at $3500 and the btc was valued at $200 per coin when you made the purchase and 1 hour later it is $90 per coin then you should understand why the vendor would want to cancel it. <br /><br />Notice I said&nbsp; &quot;should understand&quot;. I didn&#039;t say you should like it. Nor did I say it was right of them to do it. In fact I already said that is bullshit and should NEVER happen.<br /><br />&nbsp;Of course you would not like that if it happened to you. Just like you do not like when you make a purchase for $3500 at the value of $100 per coin and the next day before the vendor has not marked it in transit ..and the value of the btc is now $220. You would want the vendor to cancel the order so you could then place the same order and you the buyer would be able to place that order and still have&nbsp; left over $1000 in btc left. That would be nice.<br /><br />But the truth it everyone, including the vendor should understand why you would want that....but they should not cancel your order. The fact is you paid $3500 for the pound...and even with the btc showing a value of $220 compared to the $100 it was when you made the purchase...you still paid the $3500 and the vendor still made the $3500. It makes no difference what the &quot;value&quot; of the coin has done...you guys have already made a deal. And the truth is...by the time you finalize the coin might be worth $90. But even when you finalize that does not mean that the vendor is going to get $90 for the coin. They may get $400.... if they are stupid they might get $80 per coin. <br /><br />The truth is ALL OF US know that the btc fluctuates. And the fact is that everyone...most importantly....the vendors have seen in the last month the coin go from $60 to $260. And on a lot of days they saw it go up $30 per day or more. So no one should be caught off guard. No vendor should cancel an order because the btc has gone from $200 to $90!!! There is NO WAY a vendor didn&#039;t know that was or could happen. And if they were worried about that..then in the example like the one I gave you....the $3500 for a pound...that is enough money where the vendor should do one of&nbsp; 2 things...they should put their listings in HEDGE mode......OR they should not list an item because they are not willing to take the risk of it falling. Or there is a third option...they realize that the btc can &quot;crash&quot; at any minute...and while it was...they take their listings down. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with a vendor taking a listing down. That is just smart. BUT it is TOTAL BULLSHIT if a vendor cancels an order because the btc has fallen too much! And if a vendor did that..then I totally understand you the buyer being pissed. And you should not make a purchase again. As I said...all vendors are well aware of the fluctuations of the BTC. So they should not have a listing up and take orders un-hedged if they are going to cancel the orders when it crashes. It would just show you that you are dealing with a moron vendor. <br /><br />There is no excuse for a vendor saying he cancelled the order because of the btc falling. That vendor knew dam well that could happen. So on an item like a pound of weed...they should just have it hedged. The vendors that are in these forums crying because they sold a fucking gram of weed for $25 bucks...and now when the buyer finalized that $25 is $13 is a joke. First they knew that the btc could crash. Also for the last year...up until&nbsp; a few days ago..all that has happened is that the btc has gone up. And for the most part when they sold that $25 gram...by the time the buyer finalized it was worth $40 or more!! And they were not complaining then. So they complain when they lose... that is laughable. Not only is it only a few bucks...but again they knew when they placed that listing...that the btc is going crazy..both ways...so they should be well aware. Also, and this is the most important part...it is always just &quot;paper value&quot; they are never &quot;losing&quot; money. Any good vendor, that is smart, should realize that it really makes no difference what the btc is day to day. As it makes no difference as they are not selling those coins for cash at those prices anyways. And again, any item that is real money, they either chose to not list it as the market is to unstable..or they choose to list it with the hedge option( though a really smart vendor knows that does not offer 100% protection) or they realize that in the short term..7 days they might see the value on paper of that btc go up or down 40% , they realize by the time they go to sell that btc it will in fact (based on the last 12 months) go up. Also they realize that it could have been a bubble and therefore they just decided to not list anything as they don&#039;t want to take the risk of selling something at a value of $100 per coin and when they have to sell it..it might be $60 per coin.<br /><br />But this OP was stating how it is wrong for a vendor to take a listing down. AND THAT IS TOTALLY STUPID. What is wrong is for any vendor to cancel an order based on the fact that the btc has gone down. And it is just as wrong for a buyer to want to cancel an item because the btc has gone up. You the buyer realize that the btc can go up when you placed the order. If you thought it was going to go up...then do not place an order. What this OP said is about as stupid as it would be for a vendor to make a post that says......<br /><br />&quot; Should we the vendors make a list of the buyers that chose not to buy because they are waiting to see if the btc is going to go down or up?&quot;(I think yes) As a community and for the better of the community, I think we need to make a list of all the buyers that did not buy in the past week. As that is bullshit they didn&#039;t make purchases&quot;<br /><br />How stupid does that sound? That is the EXACT same stupid thing the OP said. Luckily if you read the thread you will see all the smart members that said it is totally fine with the vendors&nbsp; taking down listings. Of course it is OK. Just like it is totally ok with a buyer not making a purchase. <br /><br />Also if a buyer wants to cancel an order because the value has gone up...you as a vendor should say ok... And you should also tell them that you will not take an order from them again.<br /><br />And if you are a vendor that cancels an order because the btc went down..... you should not be vending. Not only is it fucked up to do that to a buyer...it really just shows how stupid you are and how you should not be a vendor.

				All the people agreeing to this, are you for real?<br /><br />Vendors are meant to lose out on huge amounts of cash coming in to their business because you want cheaper drugs? <br /><br />I never pulled mine, but if I felt the amount of order would jeopardise my business in anyway, then fucking right I would have.

Imagine the best vendor for a particular substance on the road got 100 order while coins were at their lowest and he hadn&#039;t hedged, well if he goes through with it and decided to post all orders... Good Mr Vendor, you&#039;re probably broke now&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Stop complaining. We as vendors are here to conduct business. I love this community as well, but I am a SR business man. You wouldn&#039;t go in to a regular store and complain about something so stupid, so don&#039;t come on here and do it.<br /><br />Thank you

				MrAnonymous, a vendor has a clear choice to either hedge or not hedge their orders. It is no one&#039;s fault other than a greedy vendor&#039;s, if they lost out big time with the current drop in the BTC rate. They took a gamble in not hedging their orders. Many probably cashed out a lot of coins prior to the crash and made some good money (and congrats to those that were smart enough to do so), but if the gamble didn&#039;t pay off and they got screwed, I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s fair of them to cancel an order a buyer has already made. There happy to reap the rewards when the prices were climbing but won&#039;t cop it on the chin when the reverse happens.

By hedging them, you&#039;re taking the fluctuations of the BTC Market out of play, even though there is a 6% fee. For a 6% fee, at least you will have peace of mind and not worry so much on what the market is doing each and every day.<br />The best vendors on SR wouldn&#039;t have had all their eggs in the one basket, meaning if something was to happen, they would eliminate the possibility of losing everything. Never bet more than you can afford to lose. Those that go &quot;all in&quot; rarely come out on top. That&#039;s what I was trying to portray before Dingo Ate My Drugs, but I fucked it up. Sorry about that. <br />This whole topic could have been avoided if vendor&#039;s chose to hedge their orders. It&#039;s as simple as that.

				I just had my fucking life ruined by a vendor (Kensho) cancelling on me after I ordered. I ordered at least 24 hours before the crash too. The fact that you you still had your listings up when you had no product to sell on hand is very telling.<br /><br />Fucking likely to kill myself as this completely shatters my personal (it was ordered for my best friend), professional (I am a weed buyer for said friend, I was already $2900 in debt to him, now it&#039;s 4000, and he might not wanna order again, so now I have no way to pay him back), and social life.<br /><br />I don&#039;t eat the first crumb of bread without buying weed. And now that might be all over, or at least severely fucked.<br /><br />I gotta find a friend to talk me down from the ledge.

Everything he has posted is 100% correct. It&#039;s how a vendor should operate and any vendor with an opposing view is kidding themselves. To oppose Rx&#039;s view is a simple case of pure greed. You&#039;re happy to take a buyer&#039;s coins when the price is rising and make a nice profit but by the same token, when you take the same risk and things go the other way, instead of copping it on the chin and learning from your mistake, you try to justify your decision to cancel an order with a buyer because YOU made the mistake of not hedging your orders and are going to lose money. If a vendor can&#039;t see that by doing this you&#039;re undermining the confidence in the community of being able to place an order without fear of it being cancelled, then perhaps SR is not for them. They should stick to vending IRL with real cash.&nbsp;

				RxKing:&nbsp; It is a copy paste thing there buddy. MAYBE something did get messed up, that is why I wouldn&#039;t name anyone. That is one aspect I am pretty careful about, but meh...&nbsp; I guess respect is a word I shouldn&#039;t have used. I didn&#039;t lose much, they actually responded when I questioned it, and I am a big boy, so I try not to&nbsp; :&#039;(. Now, say that name started coming up here on forums as a scam or such, then yes I would verify with that story at least. Shit happens, but it was very coincidental timing and the first time I have ever heard that line.&nbsp; ::)

				First....as a vendor I have every right to take down MY listings whenever I please.<br /><br />Who the fuck is that buyer telling me I cannot do that....make a LIST?<br />Where do you work, administration ?<br />&nbsp;Don&#039;t buy from him till he clean up his act? The fucking arrogance!!<br /><br />Like is been said many times before ....you would be nowhere with no vendors who take more risk and take all the afford to make it all to your doorstep.<br />And saying they are getting rich easy? You had that money too.... only you want to put it up your nose, vains or whatever&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />The only thing I would not do is cancel an order after its in the orderlist, being there is an agreement to sell so to speak.<br />The order is there so I cannot/will not cancel<br /><br />The reason I take a/my listing down is that the coins are dropping faster than SR -can- correct with the pegged prices.<br />Say at 1300 its 1btc $150.....1310 only 1btc $100. <br />SR is still at 1 btc/$150 for at least some time. <br />It should be 1.5btc in the listing so selling now I will loose 50 $<br /><br />If the SR price would change just as fast as the MtGox there would be no problem at all....the dollar / coin would stable.<br />It does not matter if the value of a pill is 1 btc or 10 as long as the dollar/btc is pegged <br />That the coins are loosing value does not influence the selling.<br />There was a time...not so long ago that a coin was ahhhhh 5 euro/ 8 dollar and at that time a pill cost 5 coins a piece.<br /><br />So, be happy there are vendors to get you your so much wanted and needed supply and respect what they do.<br />In general they have more know-how&nbsp; about the business than you as a buyer.<br />And don&#039;t be so arrogant to think you can tell somebody to do something because you think they&#039;re doing wrong.<br />(vendor over a year now 500+ sales)<br /><br /><br />

Since the BTC price was going up, the 24 hour average that SR uses was lower than the current BTC price at any time, and the buyer got charged more BTC (if the price was pegged to the dollar). So not only did you withdraw more BTC, but the price continued to rise until you cashed out, which for some vendors can be a few weeks.<br /><br />Nobody complains when the going is good. Vendors were basically getting bonuses for 2 months, and the BTC crashed in one day, so then they cancelled orders, causing the buyers to lose money.<br /><br />

				One of the BIG problems on here is the vendors that are dumb as shit. Unfortunately there seem to be quite a few lately..<br /><br />There should not be one vendor cancelling orders because of the fall of the BTC. I have read the vendors explanations and they just say more stupid shit. They act as if they had no clue the btc was a currency that go&#039;s down just as fast as it go&#039;s up.<br /><br />Some of these idiots placed their listings....then cancelled the orders and cost the buyers 50% of there money. All because THE VENDORS are&nbsp; too fucking stupid to understand how the btc works. Then some have gone on to act as if they are an expert in btc and that&nbsp; they fully understand the market. If I were a buyer I would be very pissed too! Every vendor should know EXACTLY what can happen with the btc when they place the listing up. And the truth is they do. They just decided to gamble with the buyers money and when it didn&#039;t go well..they just bailed out and stuck the buyer with the bill.<br /><br />And then they have tried to get sympathy saying they have multiple orders and could have lost $1000 dollars if they did not cancel!!!! Oh really...a whole $1000 dollars? So instead of you losing $1000 you decide to stick 20 buyers for $50 each?&nbsp; Then you want to offer your shitty product as &quot;make up&quot;. If they can give the product as make up...then WHY THE FUCK DID THEY JUST NOT SHIP IT IN THE FIRST PLACE??????? IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE!<br /><br />&nbsp;There should not be ONE vendor that loses money ...well in fact they do not lose any money...but they lose perceived value... if they in fact went on to sell the btc they just got... right away at the low price they would then lose money. But who the fuck does that? I&#039;ll answer...NO VENDOR! Also every single&nbsp; vendor should know the market and how the btc works. They should also be on top of shit...and if the btc falls on Mt.gox then they should take their listing down. They should still fill any order they have got as they knew dam well when they listed the item that the btc could fall. I mean this is elementary shit.<br /><br />Things get even worse when other vendors chime in and say stupid shit like &quot; Did you ever think that the vendor could have another 20 orders where they could lose $50&quot;&nbsp; How the fuck is that the buyers fault? On top of that...lets say the vendor does....ok so what? If the btc price went up $30 would they be cancelling the orders? <br /><br />And again the MAIN POINT is that EVERY SINGLE VENDOR&nbsp; knows about the btc. They all know EXACTLY what can happen and they should know that the btc can fall and that if it does and they have listing up that those listings will be affected. It is not like the btc has been $20 for the last 9 months...then in 1 hour it dove to $2 and it stayed there. Yet many have acted like that.<br /><br />Yes, there are plenty of vendors that did not and would not ever do this. Yes, there are a lot of scummy buyers. This shit is well known to any vendor. And this has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH VENDORS CANCELLING ORDERS BECAUSE THE BTC WENT DOWN AND THEN TRYING TO JUSTIFY IT WITH STUPID FUCKING &quot;FACTS&quot; ...LOL ....ABOUT THE BTC. No vendor is more pro vendor then me. But I am more pro &quot;do business the right way&quot; then pro vendor. And if something/someone is wrong then no one should make excuses for it/them just because they are a vendor. Be smart.

The fucking arrogance!!<br /><br />Like is been said many times before ....you would be nowhere with no vendors who take more risk and take all the afford to make it all to your doorstep.<br />And saying they are getting rich easy? You had that money too.... only you want to put it up your nose, vains or whatever&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />The only thing I would not do is cancel an order after its in the orderlist, being there is an agreement to sell so to speak.<br />The order is there so I cannot/will not cancel<br /><br />The reason I take a/my listing down is that the coins are dropping faster than SR -can- correct with the pegged prices.<br />Say at 1300 its 1btc $150.....1310 only 1btc $100. <br />SR is still at 1 btc/$150 for at least some time. <br />It should be 1.5btc in the listing so selling now I will loose 50 $<br /><br />If the SR price would change just as fast as the MtGox there would be no problem at all....the dollar / coin would stable.<br />It does not matter if the value of a pill is 1 btc or 10 as long as the dollar/btc is pegged <br />That the coins are loosing value does not influence the selling.<br />There was a time...not so long ago that a coin was ahhhhh 5 euro/ 8 dollar and at that time a pill cost 5 coins a piece.<br /><br />So, be happy there are vendors to get you your so much wanted and needed supply and respect what they do.<br />In general they have more know-how&nbsp; about the business than you as a buyer.<br />And don&#039;t be so arrogant to think you can tell somebody to do something because you think they&#039;re doing wrong.<br />(vendor over a year now 500+ sales)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are a shitty fucking vendor. AND A TOTAL FUCKING IDIOT. <br /><br />It is not SR&#039;s fault you are fucking dumb as shit and terrible. Do you know what a 24 hour weighted average is? If you did then you would not type half the stupid shit you have. You have said so much WRONG, DUMB, STUPID shit I am convinced you are a girl.<br /><br />You&nbsp; have no clue what you are even talking about. And the fact you even say------<br /><br />If the SR price would change just as fast as the MtGox there would be no problem at all....the dollar / coin would stable<br /><br />Cements you are one of the stupidest fucking vendors on the road. Do everyone a favor and after you pull your listings, pull your vendor account.<br /><br />That was the nicest way I could say that.

I don&#039;t want to be a vendor. I&#039;m happy being a buyer. If it&#039;s so hard to be a vendor, QUIT! No one&#039;s got a gun to your head! It does sound like you&#039;re out of your depth though and have no idea about running a business.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; How many times do you need to be told... Even hedged orders were not safe.<br /><br />SR fucked up and showed the wrong price for the BTC by 30 something dollars.<br /><br />Without vendors this place doesn&#039;t work. You would think buyers would be a little more respectful, we risk our asses and go the extra mile and end up just getting bad mouthed.<br /><br />Do you know how difficult it is being a vendor?

With risk comes reward!! What buyer has respect for a vendor who cancels an order they placed because the vendor didn&#039;t hedge the listing and it suddenly dropped in value, costing him money?? Who&#039;s fault was it that you left the order unhedged hoping to reap a huge profit only to find things had bone the other way? I&#039;m never going to respect anyone who rips others off!! Cancelling orders that were already placed is wrong and any vendor who did that should be avoided IMO. Buyers don&#039;t need vendors, you&#039;ve got that around the wrong way. When you pack it in, another 2 will join SR. Without buyers, you wouldn&#039;t have a business. Pull your head out of your ass and stop acting like a little baby. You have to earn respect and people won&#039;t badmouth you if you do the right thing. If you can&#039;t comprehend that, then you&#039;re in for a cunt of a time. I don&#039;t need to have a crack at vending. I run a large company in real life, employing many people and turning over millions a year in revenue. This is about basic business principles and looking after the customers who keep you in business. Unfortunately, your opinion is to cancel orders and screw your &quot;valuable&quot; customers over to recuperate some of your losses. ??? ???&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Rx, you&#039;re on fire! :) You make complete sense to me mate.

If they can give the product as make up...then WHY THE FUCK DID THEY JUST NOT SHIP IT IN THE FIRST PLACE??????? IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE!<br /><br />&nbsp;There should not be ONE vendor that loses money ...well in fact they do not lose any money...but they lose perceived value... if they in fact went on to sell the btc they just got... right away at the low price they would then lose money. But who the fuck does that? I&#039;ll answer...NO VENDOR! Also every single&nbsp; vendor should know the market and how the btc works. They should also be on top of shit...and if the btc falls on Mt.gox then they should take their listing down. They should still fill any order they have got as they knew dam well when they listed the item that the btc could fall. I mean this is elementary shit.<br /><br />Things get even worse when other vendors chime in and say stupid shit like &quot; Did you ever think that the vendor could have another 20 orders where they could lose $50&quot;&nbsp; How the fuck is that the buyers fault? On top of that...lets say the vendor does....ok so what? If the btc price went up $30 would they be cancelling the orders? <br /><br />And again the MAIN POINT is that EVERY SINGLE VENDOR&nbsp; knows about the btc. They all know EXACTLY what can happen and they should know that the btc can fall and that if it does and they have listing up that those listings will be affected. It is not like the btc has been $20 for the last 9 months...then in 1 hour it dove to $2 and it stayed there. Yet many have acted like that.<br /><br />Yes, there are plenty of vendors that did not and would not ever do this. Yes, there are a lot of scummy buyers. This shit is well known to any vendor. And this has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH VENDORS CANCELLING ORDERS BECAUSE THE BTC WENT DOWN AND THEN TRYING TO JUSTIFY IT WITH STUPID FUCKING &quot;FACTS&quot; ...LOL ....ABOUT THE BTC. No vendor is more pro vendor then me. But I am more pro &quot;do business the right way&quot; then pro vendor. And if something/someone is wrong then no one should make excuses for it/them just because they are a vendor. Be smart.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are so funny when you are angry and did not understand what it was about.<br /><br />Every vendor does know....SR is late with correcting the prices.<br />Usually the prices are pegged so it does not make a difference in a &#039;&#039;normal&#039;&#039; situation but when it goes to fast it is just not up to date and you get say 1 bitcoin instead of 1.25 or 1.50.<br /><br />I also said i would not cancel an order already in the orderlist so why so angry to me?<br />I said that if it was there it is an agreement, a deal. What is so shitty about that ?<br />Again, you are barking up the wrong tree (suppose I care of course LOL)<br />Yes we vendors make money and a lot too (when all is done well), are you jealous? Did you spend your money putting it up your nose or where ever?<br />I don&#039;t care, its your money but why angry at the ones selling it to you and because of that make a good profit?<br />You can write another a4 comments/insults......I don&#039;t care, I sit in the sun with a cocktail waiting for the orderlist to fill up en tomorrow I will ship it out and sit in the sun again.<br />How about you ?&nbsp; :P<br /><br />

All because THE VENDOR is too fucking stupid to understand how the btc works. Then some have gone on to act as if they are an expert in btc and they fully understand the market. If I were a buyer I would be very pissed too! Every vendor should know EXACTLY what can happen with the btc when they place the listing up. And the truth is they do. They just decided to gamble with the buyers money and when it didn&#039;t go well..they just bailed out and stuck the buyer with the bill.<br /><br />And then they have tried to get sympathy saying they have multiple orders and could have lost $1000 dollars if they did not cancel!!!! Oh really...a whole $1000 dollars? So instead of you losing $1000 you decide to stick 20 buyers for $50 each?&nbsp; Then you want to offer your shitty product as &quot;make up&quot;.

Who&#039;s fault was it that you left the order unhedged hoping to reap a huge profit only to find things had bone the other way? I&#039;m never going to respect anyone who rips others off!! Cancelling orders that were already placed is wrong and any vendor who did that should be avoided IMO. Buyers don&#039;t need vendors, you&#039;ve got that around the wrong way. When you pack it in, another 2 will join SR. Without buyers, you wouldn&#039;t have a business. Pull your head out of your ass and stop acting like a little baby.

But your very large company can&#039;t adjust prices to make up for it... But the government has said this is going to last 3 days (lets say these are your 3 busiest days of the year)...<br /><br /><br />What are you going to do? You keep trading you lose a HUGE amount of cash. Or you shut shop.. You shut shop till it&#039;s over. All is well.<br /><br /><br />But.... OH SHIT!! You have a website and while this happened 100 people placed orders that equaled 10 mil in the old currency, but now you&#039;re only getting 5Mil for it and it costs 6mil to make and post and sell this shit. <br /><br />So you haven&#039;t made any money and you either have the choice to lose a bunch of cash or refund peoples old money(meaning they might have to take the hit). So you refund and some people take a hit.. But you don&#039;t care, because you are running your own business and just saved yourself financially. <br /><br />And please don&#039;t mention... &#039;That&#039;s different, you&#039;re talking about millions&#039; in terms of the amount of money available to the business/vendor it&#039;s the same.<br /><br /><br />I do see where you are coming from, and I&#039;m not trying to argue with you. But you can&#039;t possible comment until you are or have been a vendor and have been in the situation - it&#039;s unfair. <br /><br /><br />

				wow RxKing, you have impressed me immensely. One of the most logical, objective, and intelligent posters I&#039;ve encountered. The fact that you&#039;re a vendor and are able to articulate the real issue here instead of taking the biased stance of knocking down any criticism keeps me optimistic of SRs future, assuming you&#039;re not the only one who thinks that way. Many people here are disagreeing with you but it&#039;s clear they&#039;re on another argument, not addressing your points. namely, that it&#039;s completely the vendors&#039; responsibility to be aware of the market, place smart bets or hedge, and never place bets with the buyers&#039; coin. This isn&#039;t an attack on vendors and their ability to make money. it&#039;s an attack on stupid greedy vendors. Being a vendor alone shouldn&#039;t give you a green light to such shady practices simply because they&#039;re providing a product you want. There should absolutely be a level of honesty that includes not playing with other peoples money. I&#039;ll be fanning you immediately, you&#039;ve won a customer in me.

Too many opinions have been expressed here for you to simply change the thread title. And you can&#039;t simply delete this thread. If you do, you will eventually need to get a new username, and you will have to start all over again.<br /><br />IMAHO, probably better to either lock (not delete) the thread, or even better, just leave it.

It just shows that you...along with a lot of other people (but I expect a lot of buyers to not understand it) do not understand 24 hour weighted average. If you did...then you wouldn&#039;t say half the stupid shit you do. You would say the other half...but at least you could leave the btc talk out of it.<br /><br />Well it is nice that once again the BTC is on the rise and we do not have to filter out all the threads of all the vendors, that do not know shit, complain about how SR updates the btc price. Though I suspect we are about to start hearing how btc is flying UP and SR is dragging on updating. I just hope before you guys post that bullshit..you actually try and understand 24 hour weighted average first.<br /><br />Also I am sure no vendors are cancelling orders this week! (I still think buyers should out those idiots that stuck you ( the buyer) with the loses.

				We have and will continue to hedge all escrow and take a 4% hit over time to keep from having to pull listings or worry about market fluctuations. A 4% margin buffer isn&#039;t hard to install into your business plan even after the fact. Vendors that go unhedged deserve to loose money for playing with fire. BTC is too volatile to keep for longer than 1-2 weeks at this point, and you need to set up better ways of cashing yourself out if you don&#039;t have the ability to get rid of your entire BTC stash in under a week. Now when it comes to making lists and whatnot, this doesn&#039;t help ANYONE. It does nothing but cause drama on the boards and the site itself and is bad for PR. Please understand that some vendors are shady while others are truly on the up and up. We try to remain transparent as best we can in our store, but not everyone is so nice so just research carefully before ordering. Also ordering during extremely volatile times is a risk for the buyer as well since we as sellers have a RIGHT to cancel any order placed with us within 4 days per our agreement with DRP and the SR site. This is so WE can choose who WE do business with (also it keeps buyers from canceling an order while a vendor is in the process of shipping it out). At the same time, every buyer has the ability to research and choose the vendors that treat them the way they want. If you personally felt like someone screwed you over then simply don&#039;t order from them anymore. With few exceptions, no one vendor has a monopoly over any category that they do sales in, even for their home country in most cases. The only way to start lowering sales is for LEO to start getting us to not trust each other, and this type of behavior by just starting this thread is detrimental to the site as a whole. Bad vendors will start to drop once people stop using them, but one or two incidents during a VERY volatile period of trade is no excuse to start some sort of witch hunt...... Just some food for thought folks......

Dumb, pompous upstarts like you, no doubt a youngster, haven&#039;t got a clue.

LOL<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you have been here a year and you only have 500 sales...you really are a shitty vendor :)<br /><br />What&#039;s even worse is that you claim to be a vendor, yet you won&#039;t give your vendor name. When people hide behind forum names...it really shows what a total fuck stick they are. If you want to hide behind a forum name and never tell anyone you are a vendor...ok. ....I mean that is your choice..BUT if you hide behind a name..then come in here and tell everyone you are a vendor and you have perfect feedback and blah blah blah blah..you really are a scumbag, I like scumbags btw...just not ones that hide.<br /><br />I left this thread to early. As after I posted you&nbsp; said even more stupid shit about the BTC prices and how SR doesn&#039;t update fast enough. Once again NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH!<br /><br />SR updates the btc price as perfect as one could expect. It just shows that you...along with a lot of other people (but I expect a lot of buyers to not understand it) do not understand 24 hour weighted average. If you did...then you wouldn&#039;t say half the stupid shit you do. You would say the other half...but at least you could leave the btc talk out of it.<br /><br />Well it is nice that once again the BTC is on the rise and we do not have to filter out all the threads of all the vendors, that do not know shit, complain about how SR updates the btc price. Though I suspect we are about to start hearing how btc is flying UP and SR is dragging on updating. I just hope before you guys post that bullshit..you actually try and understand 24 hour weighted average first.<br /><br />Also I am sure no vendors are cancelling orders this week! (I still think buyers should out those idiots that stuck you ( the buyer) with the loses.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Maybe I have real good stuff that is pretty rare and difficult to get....sold out every time before I get new. <br />Happy to have 500+ of those sales.<br />Not some weed or coke dealer.<br />Real funny that a guy like you (big know it all hot shot) is so anxious to know who or what I am....I couldn&#039;t care less about you.<br />Is that your &#039;&#039;strength&#039;&#039; putting people down because there is one small thing (like btc) that you know more about than the average person here?<br />So, find another victim who cares about what you have to tell them, I for sure am not&nbsp; 8)<br />Just sitting in the sun seeing my coins roll in&nbsp; ;D<br />And I never cancel an order because I am fortunate enough not to care..... <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Wow..the more you post..the stupider you get. I do not give to fucks who you are. I could care less if you are a vendor or a bottom for&nbsp; Vivid gay division.<br /><br />anxious ?? Since you are sold out and you have nothing to do..since SR is down you cant count your coins..you should try reading this thread and see what you have said about me. All I have done is echo what EVERY single person in here has said. YOU ARE A MORON.<br /><br />Then I read your post on BTC and it was so awful I had to comment. The fact you are a vendor(if you are) is so embarrassing that I had to come in here and remind the readers that they should not use you as a benchmark. And at that time I was just talking about btc and your take on it. For a vendor...you have the lest knowledge I have ever read.<br /><br />Yes my strength is finding complete jackasses that have no fucking clue what they are talking about..yet the come into a thread and post away like they are DPR&#039;s right hand man. BTW only a fucking dumb cunt would say &quot;put people down in a sentence&quot; ..So embarrassing. Also realize I came into this thread to help others not you. In fact i pointed out how fucking wrong and stupid you are...and guess what...so did every single other poster in this thread.<br /><br />Also genius, you keep coming after me! All I do is point out truths about you(since you seem to not be able to tell the truth about yourself) and I can&#039;t help it that you know nothing about the btc but you post as if you developed Mt.Gox. And you are not sitting in the sun... open your eyes...the heat you feel is from the logs in the fireplace that keeps you warm since you live in that shit part of the world that never see&#039;s 80*. And your not counting coins. You are just counting the same coin over and over and over. Because I will say it again, selling only 500 orders in the last year...you have no coin.<br /><br />Also get it clear about yourself. I was pointing out how fucking lame it is...to claim you are a vendor yet you are in the forums hiding. You can&#039;t even admit who you are. And the real reason for that is because you know in these forums you come off as a total fucking retard.You come off so bad that you are in fact scared to give us your vendor account name. You have to be a total loser to come in here and claim you are a vendor yet you cant give out your vendor name...also the way you write is exactly how a girl would write. A really dumb one. Well that is every girl..<br /><br />And you never cancel because you never get orders!! You only average 1 package a day. LOL And also...you totally care...if you didn&#039;t..you wouldn&#039;t talk about it...and you wouldn&#039;t be ashamed of yourself in here that you will not give out your vendor account. Also I realize you are not a vendor..but you can keep telling yourself you are. I don&#039;t give a fuck.<br /><br />Just do us ALL a favor..and never talk about btc again. That was so poorly written on top of the fact that things you talked about as facts are in fact...totally wrong. You should be really embarrassed. You know...kinda like you are about being a vendor. At least admit you are a female...that is CRYSTAL CLEAR!<br /><br />To sum up...please no more talk from you about the btc...you have written the 3 worst post ever written on SR about btc. Yes, you were that wrong and came off that stupid. That is what i cared about..the info..not the dumb cunt saying it. Also after 4...go back to 1.
