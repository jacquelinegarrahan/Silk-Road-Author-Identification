				-----------------------What&#039;s&nbsp; a good listing of smokable H? <br />-----------------------Also, when smoking H, how would I get more smoke in my lungs more quickly? I want to get as high as possible by just smoking H (so no injections, snorting, pill popping, etc.).<br /><br />I&#039;m considering purchasing the listing at http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/18407 from dolfan2500.<br /><br />His description reads, <br /><br />&quot;JUST LOWERED PRICE TOO!!!!<br />&nbsp;*Also you can sniff,smoke or poke this without anything to break it down good as is! New batch Again.<br /><br />&nbsp;New batch. Its .1 bags 1/10th a gram this is an estimate not always Exact. I DO NOT WEIGH THE BAGS But I make each bag up my self and I eye them sometimes their a lil more than .1 sometimes a lil less I eye it and give every bag the same amount, Bags are always good. Im a Husler IRL and sell the same bags I sell on SR on the streets face to face. Price includes shipping First Class to USA only. Thank you to all my Repeat Customers!&quot;<br /><br />Thanks for any help!

				There is a H review thread in the Rumor Mill filled with knowledgeable H users that would probably give you a lot of good information. Cheers!

				This has been said many times, in more detail, even by myself before in other threads. Use the search function because most of the questions you will have are already answered. I too would highly suggest to read the H vendor thread as suggested by one of the best H vendors tony<br /><br />For H, the forms that are most smokeable will be the freebase #3 and tar. Recommended sellers include psilocin and JD2012<br /><br />Dolfan, Wumg, and Tony all have the salt form, #4, which is good for IV and snorting but doesnt vaporize without largely degrading so you will waste the H<br /><br /><br />Just so you know, smoking has a great bioavailability and rapidly delivers the drug to the bloodstream, producing a rush as close to IV as you can get. Smoking some cuts is actually extremely dangerous though, why are you against snorting? If you want to get higher, just add more heroin to make more smoke. Careful though, psilocin, JD, wumg, tony all have fire H and you could easily overdo it. There is a proper technique to smoking involving letting the H actually run down the foil, and not just melting/burning it in one place. If you are not using the correct process or type of H you are likely wasting most of your supply. If you are, you wont have any trouble getting high :)<br /><br />Good luck, <br />- miR
