				Yeah I am gonna lose a pile if it bottoms out ... but I also made a pile when it was going up and I was seeing $2000 for some of my ounces .... so its my fault maybe not cashing out as much as I should have.<br /><br />If it gets back to 125-150 I will be happy ... the ridiculous spike from Apr 1-8 was totally obscene.<br />

Anybody who bought before then -- meaning anybody who held onto their coins for more than 2 weeks -- hasn&#039;t lost money. You should either spend immediately or be in it for the long haul. You are right though, that trying to make a buck off short term trends is probably destined for failure.<br />

				Had a few grand sitting in my account to make a large purchase that wasnt listed as quick as I had hoped, however, I made out in about 1400 in equity over about 4 days of that btc value spike. Placed a few orders with the excess coin, some stuff that I could resell at a profit, and some stuff for the head. Overall only lost about 160 in equity on the few hundred or so left in my account. Got lucky though, was almost thinking there was no way to lose, and I was stupid not to sit on that coin further. Glad I went the safe route in the end.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I hold cash in mtgox and only buy btc when I&#039;m making a purchase so no money lost that way at least. I invest in stocks, mutual funds and currencies for my real investments lol<br /><br />Good luck to you all. I hope that Vendors will be upstanding and take the loss rather than be tempted into selective scamming / order cancellation. They made lots of extra money on the rise after all which would offset any losses if they were cashing out regularly. If a vendor did that to me I would name and shame...<br /><br />CC

				Infinite respect for vendor subtickle, who honored 13.5g MDMA order at a huge loss to himself. <br /><br />I imagine many vendors stuck it out because they&#039;d been making up to 200% profits as bitcoin was rising.<br /><br />DPR really needs to stop linking SRs bitcoin price to Mtgox though. The guys at mt have proven themselves to be moronic, and their lag is notorious. <br /><br />Thankfully right now there are some very serious people building an exchange that is at a world class level of technology, that can actually handle massive quantities of transactions.<br /><br />There will be more bubbles with Bitcoin, probably a couple more, and if we are to get stability that is anything like modern fiat then we certainly need to end Gox&#039;s monopoly and get some better exchanges operating.<br /><br />

				Yes... I kept many coins when I was debating on selling at $254 but wanted to wait a bit because I got greedy. Yes... it pains me to ship Top Shelf ounces for 1.48 bitcoin but an order is an order.<br />Let&#039;s face it, SR isn&#039;t Walmart and scared money doesn&#039;t make money. I will take the advice of another vendor and repeat it here, sell your drugs for profit and cash out your coins ASAP. <br />As a buyer, buy and use your coins as soon as you want to make a purchase.

				I agree with TraderJoe.&nbsp; I have always spent my coins shortly after acquiring them.&nbsp; The longest I hold any significant amount of coins (hundreds of dollars worth) is a couple days at most.&nbsp; In this little drama recently I actually gained about 160-200 and spent before the drop so I lucked out but the fact is if you want to hold coins and speculate you will learn quickly the ups and downs of speculating.

				We didn&#039;t take a huge loss but we did ship every order we received and never took down our listings, although we did switch from unhedged to hedged mid crash.&nbsp; This included selling a 1/2 ounce for .63 btc so&nbsp; this customer basically got a 1/2 ounce for $63 (at $100/btc).<br /><br />We realize that our customers most likely paid more for bitcoins than they are worth now and we are in it for the long haul so we don&#039;t mind waiting for the price to recover and helping to alleviate some of the loss.

				Let&#039;s just say I should&#039;ve asked for a reship instead of taking the refund that was offered the night before the crash.&nbsp; Woke up to see my refund and got super excited, then looked at the price of the coins (down to 130 from 255 at the time of refund) and almost fainted.<br /><br />Not cashing out yet in hopes that I can at least make a couple grand back :(

Sorry to hear that mate. <br /><br />I invested about $9500 sporadically throughout the inflation with $5000 purchased the day before the crashed @211 hoping I was going to make a few grand in a short period of time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wednesday morning when it was at $244 I had over $14k in BTC and made over $5k in profit! I was at lunch with a friend who I talked into investing $500 worth of coin as I noticed the last price on Mt Gox drop down to $105.&nbsp; I had freaked out, ran home and made a purchase for $8000 @$194 and still have about 22 coins left over.&nbsp; So I still ended up walking away with $1000 profit.. hopefully it does find some stability soon because I believe that history will repeat itself and one day BTC might one day be worth $500 or even $1000 as more and more merchants are starting to accept BTC.&nbsp; &nbsp;
