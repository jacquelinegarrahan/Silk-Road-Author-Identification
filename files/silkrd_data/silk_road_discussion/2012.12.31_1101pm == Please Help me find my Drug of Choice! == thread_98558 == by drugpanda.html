				Hello fellow SR members!<br /><br />I just recently placed my first order on SR for Xanax.&nbsp; I have never tried Xanax before, but from reading the effects I think it&#039;s pretty close to exactly what I&#039;m looking for in lighter doses.&nbsp; The only problem is that I understand Xanax has quite the high potential for addiction/dependency, and is known to quickly build up a tolerance in frequent users.&nbsp; I know about this first hand w/ Benzos from having a prescription to Ambien a few years back.&nbsp; The first time taking one was incredible.&nbsp; The quick onset, the light body high and gigglyness of it that I experienced until I could no longer fight sleep was incredible.&nbsp; The very next night I had to 1.5x my dosage to achieve the same effect, and gave myself an ever increasing dosage until I ran out each month.<br /><br />My ideal drug is one that has pretty light and relaxing effects.&nbsp; My ideal drug is one that I can use to unwind from a long hard day of work, in front of the TV or computer, with light, but relaxing effects, and be slowly but surely lead into a beautiful restful sleep.&nbsp; Xanax, like I said earlier, sounds just about right for me, however I&#039;m afraid I will quickly build up a tolerance for it so I would like to know of other light easy relaxing drugs, and in particular maybe not another Benzo.&nbsp; I have tried plenty of drugs throughout my life, but find myself to have a pretty weak mind or whatever you want to call it w/ drugs like MDMA, mushrooms, and even pot.&nbsp; I can freak out easily I guess is a good way to put it, and that&#039;s why I prefer light easy drugs.&nbsp; Please make some suggestions for me guys/gals!<br /><br />TL;DR - just looking for a very light drug, preferably non-addictive, that I can use some or most nights to relax a little while and then have it help me to sleep.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like being feeling stoned or otherwise too far out of it.&nbsp; I would love a light euphoria, and possibly a slight change in feeling of limbs/extremities, like making them warm/tingly/heavy/etc.&nbsp; Thanks!

				It sounds to me like you&#039;d very much enjoy GHB.<br /><br />Don&#039;t fall for the media&#039;s demonization of this wonderful substance.<br /><br />Have a read of this excellent thread about GHB by SR&#039;s premier GHB vendor, BlueGiraffe: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.0.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had his stuff in partiuclar, haven&#039;t had it in about 7 or 8 years actually (before the public/media really knew about it).<br /><br />But, for me, it felt like a mellow mix of MDMA and weed effects.<br /><br />Maybe 70% MDMA, 30% weed.<br /><br />It&#039;s also an amazing aphrodisiac.<br /><br />Read that thread and see what you think.

				Thank you both for the replies.<br /><br />Leopard - I know what you mean about the pot.&nbsp; A little more background about myself on that subject: I&#039;m 24 now and when I was 15-16 years old I smoked a ton of pot with my friends that I discovered the drug w/.&nbsp; I loved it then, and it certainly was the right choice for me at the time.&nbsp; One day a traumatic event occurred in my life, the loss of a parent, and I smoked shortly after and I felt terrible.&nbsp; Paranoia, terrible thoughts, loss of control, the whole nine yards of bad effects that pot has the potential to deliver.&nbsp; Ever since then, I can&#039;t smoke any of it w/ out paranoia and feeling like I am socially inept and can&#039;t so much as carry on a conversation on it.&nbsp; It all boils down to my mental set on it I suppose, but I really do not think I can get over it.&nbsp; I have smoked a handful of times over the years since then, and yes, when I take one baby hit everything is fine and dandy...but I find that just oh so hard to do.&nbsp; Also, where I live, I do not have the ability to burn anything in my home, so without a vaporizer I&#039;m kind of limited on that front.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Valium, yea I plan on trying that after the Xanax.&nbsp; I expect to like that a lot too, it&#039;s just, it&#039;s still a Benzo and thus probably will build up a tolerance in my quite quickly.<br /><br />Keep it coming folks, I really do appreciate these posts and I research any drug you all mention right away.<br /><br />As for the GHB - it isn&#039;t really available on SR domestically, so I think that&#039;s out.&nbsp; But yea, I like the fact that it&#039;s a mild intoxicant.&nbsp; I could see myself taking that in VERY light doses.&nbsp; After all I do sadly love getting drunk.

				It really sounds to me that your preference would steer you toward weed. Keep in mind that THC can quickly overpower a non-tolerant user. I&#039;m guessing that you probably do not smoke pot often because of how high you feel. As THC tolerance builds, you&#039;ll notice a more manageable stone.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking to benzos for a nightly relaxation, you could end up with some dependency and withdrawal. Benzos are fun, but it is my understanding that you shouldn&#039;t let your daily dose approach the 4mg per day range for Xanax because it is known to produce withdrawal. I&#039;ve never been through benzo withdrawal but I have read that it can be worse than heroin withdrawal. Xanax is not really for producing a high, it is effective at 0.25 milligrams in non-tolerant users for anxiety. To feel relaxation, for you I would take 0.50mg up to 1mg max.<br /><br />I would order a few grams of Hash if I were you. Often hash can have a more clear headed stone (for me at least). Give it some time to saturate your receptors. As your tolerance builds you will notice it not kicking your ass as much. Also weed/hash mixed with benzos is nice too. Heroin is fun also, just don&#039;t do it longer than 3 days in a row or you&#039;ll learn why you weren&#039;t supposed to.

				I have similar effects from weed.&nbsp; I cannot smoke the super potent stuff.&nbsp; I look for the old mexican dirt weed that no one likes anymore.&nbsp; <br />If I find some of the less potent weed, and mix it with a little tobacco, or just take 1 small hit and then wait for a while to feel the effects,<br />I can get to that point of being high and relaxed without the weird feelings.&nbsp; Just takes a little patience and time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, hope this helps.

				was trying to think of something that someone didn&#039;t mention but am having trouble. GHB is probably a good suggestion, be careful with the dosage, and mixing it with other drugs, alcohol esp. Benzos prob fit the bill the best but i try to avoid them b/c they always made me want to abuse them(take them too freq. or use alcohol) for some reason plus i would have to many unproductive days(take one and want to nap) even though i was well rested. You should consider checking into marijuana more though too if you already haven&#039;t---vaporizing and eating are def. much different and are much less likely to cause paranoia. ohhh... codeine i always found extremely easy and relaxing but there&#039;s the addiction potential, not too sure how healthy it would be to use it all the time. good luck

				Whatever it is - take it if you can leave it...<br /><br />I really enjoyed GHB when I first tried it, maybe 12 years ago.&nbsp; I never had an issue with it, always respected doses, NEVER mixed it with alcohol or CNS depressants,&nbsp; never had it too often....<br />I watched a dozen people fuck themselves up with it for a year or two until someone almost died and another got busted with a HUGE amount. It&#039;s a good one for those who can use it well, but despite not being addictive in the same way heroin or nicotine is,&nbsp; some people really can&#039;t control themselves with it.&nbsp; For starters, you feel good in the morning after taking it,&nbsp; it is the best thing ever for coming off MDMA, it is relatively cheap, and a good aphrodisiac. Toooooooo easy.<br /><br />Xanax is some seriously addictive shit...&nbsp; Benzos are playing with fire IMHO.<br />

				I had the same experience as you on Pot. Loved it, then it just started getting me depressed or paranoid etc.<br /><br />But several things: first, there are multiple strains of pot and SR is a good place to explore them.<br /><br />Second, if you&#039;re in a reasonably happy place now, having a toke with friends or whatever will be entirely different to your past bad memories. Especially if you don&#039;t smoke until you can&#039;t focus on the bong anymore which is what your younger self might have done. Just a few drags and mellow out.<br /><br />I have a feeling it is much harder and more dangerous to pick a &quot;drug of choice&quot; outside weed if by that you mean very regular use. Weed is more socially acceptable, it won&#039;t have you sneaking away from polite society to imbibe alone with your demons as much.

GHB is active in the 1g - 3g range (unlike most other drugs which are generally active in the mg range). GHB is actually a carbohydrate - more akin to a nutrient with drug-like effects.<br /><br />And yes 1g is a good conservative first dose, and a good way to start to get to know the substance. But the effects may be quite subtle... On subsequent occasions you may want to take another 0.5g - 1g every 30 mins until you&#039;re grinning - and then back off. Experiment with it until your understand its dynamics in your body.<br /><br />BG
