				-= Program website (just a placeholder):&nbsp; http://5kqzr7ezpohedxxa.onion/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Final site (still under construction):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://5kqzr7ezpohedxxa.onion/new/<br /><br />-= v1.1.0 Windows all-in-one installer; zip files and exe files aren&#039;t recognized, hence the .gz file type.&nbsp; When asked, put Ruby in the default location!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://5kqzr7ezpohedxxa.onion/metasilk-1.1.0-install.exe.gz<br /><br />-= v1.2.0 tarball of Metasilk and some of the required gems (libraries), does not include Ruby.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://5kqzr7ezpohedxxa.onion/metasilk-1.2.0.tar.gz<br /><br /><br />- So here&#039;s the deal.&nbsp; The readme is in the following post, but is a little outdated.&nbsp; Almost all of it still applies though, the prog just does a little more.<br /><br />- Windows Installer: If you want a really simple Windows-style installation program, just download the Windows installer.&nbsp; What it does is install Ruby (v1.9.3-p392 as of this writing), the necessary gems, copy the Metasilk files, and then give you a start menu shortcut if you check that box during install.&nbsp; Obviously this is a little bit less transparent than copying all code yourself and looking to make sure you really are running the safe code that&#039;s been vouched for.&nbsp; Frankly it doesn&#039;t really matter, I promise it&#039;s the same code and the installer is doing nothing else, but whatever you&#039;re most comfortable with (security vs. convenience) is the best choice for you.<br /><br />- Screenshot of v0.6.0 (Linux):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://5kqzr7ezpohedxxa.onion/snapshot-0.6.0-scrubbed.png<br />- Screenshot of v0.5.1 (Windows):&nbsp; http://5kqzr7ezpohedxxa.onion/snapshot-0.5.2-win.png<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Known Bugs</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Known bugs -- updated for v1.0.4 <br />==============================================<br /><br />* Disabling display of balance in BTC causes an unrecoverable error upon updating.<br /><br />* Searching by keyword works.&nbsp; Sorting on the &quot;smart sort&quot; column sorts by category, then subsorts by price (low to high); but a ton of gtk-critical-warnings spew forth if you sort the search results list while it&#039;s still actively looking up &amp; adding listings to the results.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t crash on my system, and the program recovers just fine the way it&#039;s supposed to, but the &quot;critical&quot; warnings (wtf definition of &quot;critical&quot; do the glib devs use?) are unnerving if you see them.&nbsp; They also could crash the program on other systems for all I know.&nbsp; So in short: if it crashes, don&#039;t sort until the list is finished being loaded (the progress bar will say 100% when it&#039;s done).<br /><br />* The incognito enable/disable functions work on my basically-unused account, but not on my real buyer&#039;s account.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why, but if it works for you, awesome.&nbsp; If not, figure out why &amp; tell me &amp; I&#039;ll fix it :)<br /><br />* There may be an issue with logging in more than once per run of the program.&nbsp; You can load as many sessions as you want, but there&#039;s some unpredictable difficulty getting more than a single authenticated session ID until the prog is restarted.&nbsp; Dunno, I&#039;ll figure it out for next version.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: ChangeLog.txt</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Mon Apr 22 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Updated the URL used to access BitcoinCharts.com&#039;s API, as they&#039;re<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; removing the old URL next month.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Sun Apr 7 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Added decryption using GPG to the gpg_interface code.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Thu Apr 4 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Fixed a bug that was causing the login operation to mistakenly abort if<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a specific step failed for any reason (it should always retry timeouts<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and the like).<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Thu Apr 4 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Added an option to disable the error popups seen when unrecoverable<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; errors cause an operation to be aborted.&nbsp; If nothing else, at least this<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; will allow some kind of work-around for any bugs that start causing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; problems in the future (if the site changes, but not enough to make the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; basic functions unusable and I&#039;m in prison or something, heh).<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Sat Mar 30 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Fixed a problem with the configuration settings not being properly<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; initialized upon first run of the program.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Disabled the BTC balance display button in the options window, since<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; it&#039;s bugged and causes errors if disabled.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 29 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Fixed an issue causing an error the first run in the performance library<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; code.<br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 29 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Balances over 999 weren&#039;t parsed properly when displayed in BTC.&nbsp; Fixed.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 29 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The program log wasn&#039;t displaying the account balance correctly when<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echoing the updated values upon a change; fixed.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 29 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In Windows, the Net/HTTP lib is frequently failing due to an exception<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; not being properly propagated across threads.&nbsp; This has been causing an<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; unrecoverable error box to popup repeatedly.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how anybody<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; used the program with that happening, it must have been incredibly<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; aggravating... should be fixed.&nbsp; If it happens again, just let me<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; know and I&#039;ll take care of it.<br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Sun Mar 24 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Added some tooltips to the main window&#039;s menu items, since what they do<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; probably isn&#039;t as obvious to everyone else as it is to the guy who wrote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the program...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Added a window that displays the program&#039;s known bugs; you can find it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in the help menu.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Disabled the &quot;browse&quot; menu item, since it&#039;s unimplemented and confusing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; otherwise.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Added options to select which currencies you want Metasilk to display<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; your account balance in.&nbsp; It can be any combination of USD, EUR, and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BTC (in fact it can even be none of those if you really want).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Changed the type hint of the login dialog to &quot;normal,&quot; in order to fix<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; some window managers not displaying any title bar for it.<br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 22 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m incrementing the version number to 1.0, since it&#039;s both stable and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; relatively finished.&nbsp; Primarily it&#039;s because this is probably going to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; be the last version for quite awhile; it&#039;s possible I may never release<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; another one.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 22 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Adding a few more untracked files to revision control.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 22 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Added detection of balance changes and triggering of the corresponding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; event, which plays the sound file you set in the options.&nbsp; A cash<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; register is the default setting.&nbsp; Note that changes less than 5 USD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; are ignored, since the BTC exchange rate fluctuates &amp; changes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; estimated balance by small values.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Account balances are now displayed in US dollars, euros, and bitcoins<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; simultaneously.&nbsp; The euro value is the straight BTC to euro trading<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rate (as opposed to calculated with a BTC -&gt; USD -&gt; euro rate).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Changed the variation of pause time between cycles from +/- 60 secs to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; +/- 30 secs.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 22 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Incrementing version_minor to the next release&#039;s value.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 22 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Adding overlooked files to revision control.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Fri Mar 22 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If automatic checking for account activity is paused mid-check, the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; check will now be properly stopped; the cycle will be restarted upon<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; being re-enabled without any delay.<br /><br /><br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp;Mon Mar 18 2013<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Improved the Makefile installation routine; hopefully it&#039;ll work on more systems this way.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The program wasn&#039;t properly creating an initial empty config file to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; store preferences in, causing it to never start the first time.&nbsp; Fixed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Metasilk<br />========<br /><br /><br />A free and open source client application and API for making travelers on the Silk Road a little more comfortable.&nbsp; Primarily of interest to vendors who use the site frequently, though I find it useful even as a customer.&nbsp; For example, anytime I make a deposit I use Metasilk so that I&#039;m automatically notified the minute SR credits my account.<br /><br />That said, it&#039;s unlikely to be worthwhile for your average weekend warrior.&nbsp; It&#039;s free, but honestly it took a lot of time -- if you like it and use it, BTC donations can be made to:<br /><br />1DLVXbayVtqMBiaK9SuoFzM7PchVb4uCt9<br /><br />... and would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Truthfully I use SR quite a bit and am more often than not completely broke.<br /><br /><br /><br />### Purpose<br /><br />It started as a generic API for other utilities to interface with SR, but it turned into an always-on, always-current monitor for activity on your Silk Road account.&nbsp; It can be used either way, but the focus is really on it being a stand alone client app at this point.&nbsp; It notifies you of unread messages, outstanding orders, and always keeps you apprised of the current balance of your account (in both USD and BTC at once, naturally).&nbsp; It&#039;s actually about as pretty and easy to use as your average Windows program too if you just stick to the GUI.<br /><br />Basically it simulates full push notifications for activity on your Silk Road account, e.g. the way your mobile phone notifies you of email as soon as you get it (as opposed to pull notifications, which is what having to refresh the page is -- as in you&#039;re &quot;pulling&quot; the latest activity, it isn&#039;t being &quot;pushed&quot; to you as it happens).<br /><br />It launches into the GUI by default, but there&#039;s also a low level (nongraphical) terminal mode available for you to make use of if you like that sort of thing as much as I do.&nbsp; The program implements command history recall, history search, tab completion, etc. in the terminal interface.&nbsp; You can see usage information by using the standard Linux &quot;-h&quot; or &quot;--help&quot; arguments when executing the program if you&#039;re interested.<br /><br />The program is written in Ruby and uses GTK+2, Glade-3, and VRLib.&nbsp; It&#039;s confirmed as working in Linux, Windows 7, and Windows 8.&nbsp; Should work on a Mac or WinXP too, but don&#039;t quote me on it.<br /><br /><br /><br />### Feature list<br /><br /><br />1. Status tray icon that flashes when there&#039;s new activity.&nbsp; Keeps flashing until you interact with it (so you&#039;ll know if something happened while AFK), and won&#039;t flash again until something new happens once it stops.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1.1 It also plays a sound file when a new message or a new order come in, so you can go play a video game while you wait or something.&nbsp; The two sound files are different so you know which event occurred without having to get up and look.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1.2 You can change the sounds if you want.&nbsp; Just replace &quot;mail.wav&quot; or &quot;order.wav&quot; with your own file(s) for it to play.&nbsp; Go ahead, overwrite the file.&nbsp; If it&#039;s a wav it&#039;ll work fine.&nbsp; An MP3 may or may not work on your system.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1.3 If you really want to play an MP3 but it isn&#039;t working, to convert from mp3 format to wav, type:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sudo apt-get install sox<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sox audio_file.mp3 mail.wav<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... and prest-o change-o, it (sort of) plays your mp3 :) <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1.4 Clicking on the status tray icon toggles visibility of the full status window so it isn&#039;t in your way all the time.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1.5 Let the mouse hover over the tray icon to show a brief tooltip with the current message count, order count, and balance shown.<br /><br /><br />2. A cute little window that provides current account status at a glance, including BTC and USD at the same time (naturally).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2.1 It retries any failed connections automatically so that you know you&#039;re always seeing the latest information.&nbsp; Just sit back and let it do it&#039;s thing, it&#039;ll take care of all that hassle on its own.<br /><br /><br />3. There&#039;s some mediocre support for sending messages and reading unread messages (including PGP encryption).&nbsp; Hopefully it&#039;ll make customer service slightly less aggravating for you.<br /><br /><br />4. A slightly more advanced (as in non-graphical) mode if you want to use the terminal interface (run it with &quot;-c&quot; to get there).&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of like a Ruby version of bash, more or less; tab completion, command history, etc.&nbsp; I find GUI programming tedious and boring, so there&#039;s a lot of stuff that doesn&#039;t have buttons.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4.1 You can also evaluate any valid Ruby code on-the-fly in the terminal interface if you want to (the terminal interface command &quot;irb&quot; launches an interactive Ruby instance in the same addres space/environment as the app).<br /><br /><br />5. The underlying API, which as the program wandered away from a generic SR API and toward an end user-centric utility got less and less useful.&nbsp; If it&#039;s helpful to you, then go ahead and use it.&nbsp; As an example of what I mean, you can use the project as a library for your own code and fetch 1 or more (including all) pages of your Silk Road inbox with a single method (see &quot;Message::list&quot; in the API docs).&nbsp; Each page is fetched simultaneously in a devoted thread, as is the case with many of the features it provides (it takes into account strain on the server though, so don&#039;t expect it to go fetching 53 pages at the same time or something).&nbsp; The return of Message::list is an array of Message objects, each containing all the relevant data of a single message in the inbox.&nbsp; You would then presumably proceed to make use of your ninja-coding skills to do super cool stuff with those messages instead of waiting for SR to implement all that sweet ninja goodness for you.&nbsp; You get the idea.<br /><br />Note that not all the method calls Metasilk provides are so neat and tidy: as I said, it turned into a client for end users mostly, but the API is still there -- that&#039;s what it uses itself, after all.<br /><br /><br />If you write some sweet code that uses Metasilk to do the lifting, as always, donations for my time and effort would be appreciated.&nbsp; You&#039;re free to use it as you wish either way, PROVIDED you only use it in a manner consistent with your government&#039;s laws: I do not condone illegal activity of any kind, nor are you allowed to use this program in an illegal manner.&nbsp; Your download and use of this application signify your agreement to this legally binding End User Licensing Agreement.&nbsp; You are hereby notified of further restrictions on liability, fitness, and implications of distribution in the LICENSE.txt file.&nbsp; If you do not agree to these terms, you may not use this program until such time that you do agree.<br /><br />... because I&#039;ll come and find you and stop you, and... stuff.&nbsp; Yeah, and stuff: lots of it, too, so you best watch out!<br /><br /><br /><br />### Speed / reliability<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s not _much_ faster than a browser, but it is a little bit faster and it&#039;s a lot less irritating, that&#039;s for sure -- Metasilk doesn&#039;t just time out and say &quot;unable to load page, try again later.&quot;&nbsp; It fucking tells you something went wrong so you know why you&#039;re going to be waiting a few seconds longer than you thought for an update, then it goes and it fucking tries it again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; And fucking again if it has to.&nbsp; Fuck this &quot;manual reloading&quot; shit.&nbsp; It also plays sounds so you don&#039;t have to wander over to your computer to check if you&#039;ve got an order.<br /><br />It does a really good job of making things look smooth, but it&#039;s not magic or anything.&nbsp; Sometimes connections fail or are slow.&nbsp; You can just walk away if you want and it&#039;ll do what it has to do in order to keep its data as current as it can.&nbsp; If you like it and find yourself using it all the time, throw me some bitcoins now and then.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is I&#039;m on SR for a reason: I don&#039;t like all drugs, but I&#039;m very into my DoC and am more often than not quite literally broke.&nbsp; Help me get healthy organic fruits and veggies to offset the poisonous drugs a little bit, won&#039;t you?&nbsp; :) <br /><br />Yes.&nbsp; I am really a vegetarian health conscious drug addict.&nbsp; I want to do my DoC, not be sickly and unhealthy.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />### Security<br /><br /><br />I consider myself a man of integrity and of my word: when I say that this program is in no way trying to harm you or anyone else, I hope that&#039;s good enough for most of you.&nbsp; If not though, it&#039;s open source software -- you can look at it and change it all you like.&nbsp; I&#039;d be pretty delusional if I wrote malicious code and then expected that no one anywhere in the entire world would notice even while staring right at it, now wouldn&#039;t I be.<br /><br /><br /><br />### Caching sessions to file<br /><br />Metasilk allows you to save the current session cookie and reuse it later in order to bypass the slow login.&nbsp; Why not solve the captcha programmatically?&nbsp; Doing that is incredibly difficult even for simple ones like SR uses; infact, most often people just buy subscriptions to captcha solving services -- which themselves usually use real people solving them in real-time.<br /><br />Passwords aren&#039;t saved, just the authentication token the website uses to identify you as properly logged in.&nbsp; Basically, if you don&#039;t explicitly logout, the site has no way of knowing your browser ever even closed -- so it continues to accept the cookie days later when it sees it again.<br /><br />If you like this feature, then use it.&nbsp; It&#039;s very convenient, and session cookies remain valid for quite a long time.&nbsp; It does, however, provide an attacker that gains access to your system complete access to your account without any additional information necessary (it will NOT compromise your PIN, however, so your transactions would still be as safe as they can be with someone else logged in as you -- but messages, account history, and everything else not PIN-protected would be in their hands).<br /><br />If at some point you decide you&#039;re not comfortable with the session cookies hanging around, then just start the program and select &quot;save session&quot; before you login.&nbsp; It&#039;ll save an empty/blank cookie, effectively clearing it (until you tell Metasilk to save a logged-in session cookie again).&nbsp; It&#039;s completely up to you, but security is only at risk if someone has access to that local (100% plaintext) file.&nbsp; It&#039;s just as secure as usual if nobody can get to the file.<br /><br />You can always wipe this away by deleting/shredding/whatever-you-want the &quot;$HOME/.metasilk/cookies&quot; file manually if you like, as well.<br /><br /><br />### Other data files<br /><br />Metasilk does not keep any data anywhere except for the $HOME/.metasilk directory.&nbsp; If you remove everything in that directory, there won&#039;t be any trace of your Silk Road activities left (except what a forensics expert could recover from the disk, which poses the same risk as such a circumstance always does).&nbsp; It also will never save your password or username.&nbsp; Note that it&#039;s possible to specify the directory Metasilk uses for data files (see the &quot;-d&quot; startup parameter).&nbsp; If you do that, obviously the previous statement is no longer true -- Metasilk will not store that location nor remind you of it next time you run the program.&nbsp; If you specify the directory, it&#039;s your responsibility to remember the contents of it.&nbsp; If you really care, that is; there&#039;s hardly anything in the files anyway though.<br /><br /><br />## ZOMG, H4x3rz!<br /><br />Given that the Firefox browser most people use (the Tor browser is a version of Firefox) is ridiculously complex and full-featured for what we need, Metasilk is actually safer.&nbsp; What makes me say that, you might ask (and rightly so): Metasilk does not include a JavaScript interpreter.&nbsp; It does not parse HTML, XML, or any other markup beyond scanning for data points to internalize for use with its API (the GUI gets it&#039;s info via the underlying API).&nbsp; It does not support Java or any other plugins or extensions.&nbsp; It has no forgotten or dated features from 1992 that provide yet another zero-day exploit to be used by those out to do you harm.&nbsp; It does only what it needs to do with the site, and that&#039;s it.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know, zero-day exploits/attacks are ones that have never been seen before (as in the attack takes place on day zero).&nbsp; They&#039;re often catastrophic and nearly impossible to detect -- for a time, anyway.<br /><br /><br />## Data leaks, e.g. rogue DNS queries<br /><br />There are none that I know of.&nbsp; Metasilk will never allow a TCP connection to bypass Tor (this only applies to connections Metasilk makes, note that it doesn&#039;t mean Metasilk protects any other programs).&nbsp; It makes no DNS queries itself, it only connects to Tor and passes the info along.&nbsp; Other than the SR onion site, it does connect a few times an hour to bitcoincharts.com through Tor -- this is in order to show you accurate USD + BTC values at the same time (bitcoincharts.com offers a free-to-query-on-occasion API for various exchange data).&nbsp; As you know, SR only provides your balance in either BTC or USD, not both: Metasilk needs to get the most current value of a bitcoin from somebody somewhere so it can calculate the one SR isn&#039;t giving it.<br /><br />Every program has bugs.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Mine are not exceptions to this.&nbsp; I do, however, consider your (and my) safety to be a matter of the highest priority.&nbsp; I don&#039;t take it lightly when someone assumes I know what I&#039;m talking about and places their faith in me one way or another; I recognize that anyone who uses this program is trusting me, and I have no plans of proving anyone&#039;s trust as misplaced.&nbsp; There are mean people out there who would like to see us all, buyer and seller alike, lose our basic freedom.&nbsp; I don&#039;t plan on making that any easier for them to accomplish.<br /><br />If you find any issues, be sure to point it out to me and anyone else you feel compelled to tell.&nbsp; You&#039;ll probably want to tell me FIRST, though, so I can fix it quickly before you go telling everyone everywhere how to make use of whatever bug you&#039;ve found.&nbsp; Always remember that these are very serious charges vendors are playing with: responsible disclosure could save decades of many people&#039;s lives, or even their actual life itself.&nbsp; In short, please think about the people who want to steal from and/or arrest us all before you go yapping publicly.<br /><br />Feel free to bring things up with me if you&#039;re concerned.&nbsp; There&#039;s no shame in being wrong -- it happens to all of us now and then -- so if you suspect something, go ahead and send me some mail (preferably encrypted) mail about it.&nbsp; Please provide your own public key for me to encrypt my response with as well.&nbsp; I tend to err on the side of caution, and if you&#039;re asking me for sensitive information and/or not giving me a way to encrypt my message, I&#039;m likely going to assume you&#039;re trying to bait me or aren&#039;t a careful enough person for me to associate with in such matters.<br /><br />That means I&#039;d delete your message and write you off as someone who&#039;s more trouble than you&#039;re worth.&nbsp; Nothing personal, you understand: it&#039;s just my strong interest in self preservation.<br /><br /><br /><br />INSTALLATION<br />============<br /><br />Just run `make&#039; to install all dependencies, then run `metasilk.rb&#039; to use the program.&nbsp; This is with Ubuntu, the most common Linux distribution, in mind.&nbsp; Basically what it needs is Ruby 1.9 and some gems, but the gem installation doesn&#039;t vary from distro to distro, so once you get Ruby 1.9 installed the &quot;gem&quot; command can take care of the rest (just type &quot;make gems&quot; if you have to).<br /><br />If you want to see what things are going to be installed, just run &quot;make -n&quot; so that it&#039;ll show you without doing any of them.&nbsp; Or decide later and run it without root privileges for now -- no harm in watching it repeatedly fail to change anything at all (not to mention fail to run, since it won&#039;t have any of the required libraries to use).&nbsp; To be clear, Metasilk does not require any special privileges to run.&nbsp; It does need to download and install a few harmless dependencies that it uses though, which requires escalated permissions to do.&nbsp; All the gritty low-level details of what it &quot;installs&quot; are in the Makefile if you want to look.<br />

I wrote a client application for interacting with Silk Road, including a general purpose API (note that it&#039;s not finished yet, but it&#039;s fully functional).<br /><br />I do not have a vendor account, and I have never seen the page that vendors use regarding orders.&nbsp; Initially I intended to write a quick, clean, fast client for Silk Road because it seems that everyone who&#039;s forced to use the site is a) grateful that it&#039;s providing the service it does, and b) fucking abhors the slow, unreliable web interface.&nbsp; I have no server access, so instead of fixing the server side code like any sane developer would do, I went ahead and wrote a client that does the next best thing.<br /><br />But I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE VENDOR ORDERS PAGE, rawr!&nbsp; I cannot program an API and point-and-click functions when I don&#039;t even fucking know what they&#039;re supposed to do.&nbsp; I need someone to THOROUGHLY STERILIZE the XHTML source of the pages associated with vendor orders (as in what you see if you right-click and select &quot;view source&quot;).&nbsp; It needs to be cleaned by hand of all customer information and whatever else you think is sensitive -- I just need a peek at the DOM tree and stuff to make it work.<br /><br />Sure, I could be baiting somebody to try and hack their account;

				Thanks Eddie, I appreciate that.<br /><br />So if you download this, please consider yourself something of a beta tester.&nbsp; Also check the known_bugs.txt and readme.txt files.&nbsp; And the changelog.txt if you care.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t get it running... well, basically all it needs is Ruby v1.9 and the .gem files it comes in a zip with (plus a couple of other ones that those gems depend on, but it should take care of that for you).&nbsp; You *should* be able to type &quot;make&quot; after unpackaging the contents of the .tar.zip into a directory, and have it add a line to your torrc file so that it knows where the Tor proxy is listening for a connection.&nbsp; That part requires escalated privileges.&nbsp; The dependencies (the gems) are put into your home directory, so that part you can do as any old user -- modifying the /etc/torrc file needs privileges though.<br /><br />Also, you must always have Tor running or this program will do nothing but fail in a most epic fashion.&nbsp; It never connects to anything except through Tor, and if Tor isn&#039;t there... well, it doesn&#039;t work so good.<br /><br />In a nutshell, you&#039;re on your own getting it running for now; any bugs you find after that you should tell me about if you want me to fix them though.&nbsp; I&#039;ll work on the orders thing in a few days when I get some more time.<br /><br />http://oukryuqqc7ffenin.onion/files/54b48b3a5e88e976ac24717bce7e0585.zip<br />&nbsp;

If we could essentially crowdsource a fucking community applet that&#039;d be pretty fucking sick.<br /><br />EDIT: Also forum notifications and autorefresh would be great.

				Yes, cut out the slow cumbersome SR site and just collate the data into a easily accessible frontend. And im not just talking about replacing what already exists, but adding things like msg mgmt, order status lists (like utorrent lists torrents), better search rules (price/geography/sellerstatus), integration with gpg, etc... Think of it this way, if you create something that becomes far better than SR is, then people will migrate to it and DPR will only have to work on developing backend features. <br /><br />BTW do you have a windows version? I imagine most SR users are on windows.

				I think people are misunderstanding this thread.<br /><br />The file SelfSovereignty attached IS a functional, cross-platform Silk Road client. This isn&#039;t a theoretical. He linked the beta in his post. That being said, it&#039;s a BETA test and at the moment may have bugs and/or limitations in it&#039;s functionality (particularly in GUI mode). If you have no idea what to do with a beta program, maybe its not for you. If you have somewhat of a technical background you might find it quite useful. I have.<br /><br />Yes, it works in Windows. You have to install Ruby, add Ruby to your path, install the gem dependencies, then run metasilk.rb. Can&#039;t say it&#039;s quite /supported/ for windows yet, but it works quite well if you know how to do that sort of thing.<br /><br />I&#039;ll add some more details on getting it running under windows when I get a chance. I&#039;m still using the previous version.

The refreshing point is a valid, but you&#039;ve been beat to it: (clearnet warning) https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/check4change/<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I&#039;m quite aware that there are thousands of Firefox extensions that are capable of refreshing a page.&nbsp; Bending the entire browser to implement that list I compiled, plus anything else anyone can think of, would be virtually impossible.&nbsp; It would take months or years of tedious, aggravating work; personally I think that&#039;s just silly.&nbsp; If your opinion differs -- well, good for you.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what else to say about it.

				Ok then here&#039;s a perfect solution. Do all the backend(if you&#039;re willing), and just have someone here code the gui for you. If you do the backend, which really is the hard part, then someone can code the gui really easily i bet.

				SS, how do you feel about putting up SR listings for certain features, and after X number of people buy in then you finalize the order and implement it. Figure a reasonable price/purchaser ratio and put a timelimit on how long you will hold their money in escrow for. Keep the names of the buyers up on the product page so everyone knows how close they are to getting the feature, then let them have the updated version for so long before you make it public.

The spinner does actually work under Win. I see it otherwise normally during the program. It starts spinning then freezes w this bug. And this freeze isn&#039;t recovered from (at least not by 20 mins). It logs in successfully when restoring a session, the console output spits out &quot;x unread messages&quot; and then frozen. Something about that set_title function Windows doesnt like. Can you put it in the status bar instead?

				My point is writing analysis only works based off a subset of named authors. So they get a fingerprint of SelfSovereignty, what are they going to check it against, everything everyone has ever written anywhere? Maybe oneday when their new Protect Everyone against Terrorism project forces people to register themself online with their forehead embedded id, but until then theres no conceivable way they can correlate everything everyone writes to an identity and then fingerprint that to a persons name. <br /><br />I dont mean to sidetrack this thread but you shouldnt stall development just because youre afraid of some theoretical attack that was based off a very controlled experiment. Get some funding and support from the staff and the community and continue creating this very cool tool.

				LOL... are you for real?&nbsp; What do you think I&#039;m doing as I try to explain this -- I use the forums for mini-breaks while I work.<br /><br />What do you think I meant by &quot;basic profiling techniques,&quot; anyway?&nbsp; I meant cross referencing every list that I&#039;m almost certainly on, and coming up with perhaps 100k names or fewer.&nbsp; That&#039;s manageable.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve got the resources they do and you want to find somebody, it&#039;s not a difficult thing.&nbsp; Let me put it this way: I&#039;m relatively confident I could find every person who has over 1000 posts on this board if I had access to government databases.&nbsp; The fact that you can&#039;t imagine anyone being clever enough to do that is just... naive, I don&#039;t know how else to put it.&nbsp; This is what some people spend literally their entire lives doing.<br /><br />So we disagree.&nbsp; That&#039;s fine.&nbsp; But since it&#039;s my ass on the line and not yours, I&#039;m trusting myself and not you.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see what the big problem with that is -- obviously you don&#039;t like it, but what do you want me to say here?&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to do something just because you seem to think I should.&nbsp; Also, if you didn&#039;t realize it, I&#039;ve been working on this for 3.5 months now and this thread isn&#039;t the first time I&#039;ve mentioned it; even if I had talked to somebody from Silk Road... why the fuck would I actually say as much?&nbsp; Other than bragging rights or something, it would serve no purpose.<br /><br />Why would anyone else need to know?<br />

				Alright i got it to work on windows, looks good, very very basic interface no doubt it does more on the command line but that would be a step back from TBB. Its just as slow as TBB because of SR&#039;s crappy servers, but then again it does alert you of new messages or orders without having to actively refresh the page. The only issue with the basic gui is that it didnt show my current messages when i opened up the view messages box, even after it finished loading it never showed them. All in all the windows version seems incomplete but if you&#039;re a serious vendor you shouldnt be using windows anyways. <br /><br />Will attempt on tails and see if it works.

				Ive just finished installing ruby2.0 on windows (after uninstalling 193), reran install.bat but it gives errors that it cant install nokogirl and some others without build tools, though i selected everything when installing ruby. Either way metasilk wont run now. <br /><br />Also something occurred to me when installing this, your install bat lists specific dependencies in a specific order, couldnt this be used to profile your TBB users, since cmd/terminal goes outside of tor? Just a thought, if you can package the dependencies with your program and offer it up as a single install, or at least let people know that the risk exists and to use tails/libertie with metasilk if they are concerned this might be a better solution to protecting them.

				Yes, it&#039;s entirely possible masterblaster.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I include most of the gems.&nbsp; The problem is that the program uses... well I think it&#039;s 17 libraries all said and done.&nbsp; About 10 of which have to be compiled for the target platform.&nbsp; The ones that I don&#039;t include are so common that I don&#039;t consider it any risk at all.<br /><br />Ruby is a very popular language.&nbsp; It&#039;s much bigger than Bitcoin.&nbsp; Some of the top 10 websites in the world are built on the Ruby on Rails framework.&nbsp; There&#039;s no risk of profiling through the libraries not included -- that&#039;s my opinion, and we&#039;ve established that I&#039;m more cautious than necessary.<br /><br />As for Ruby 2.0... I haven&#039;t even tried 2.0 yet, so I&#039;m not even sure it would work even if you could install the dependencies properly.&nbsp; A higher version number does not always mean &quot;better in every way.&quot;&nbsp; The Linux kernel is on 3.8 I think now, but they still backport security fixes for the 2.6 series.&nbsp; Frequently people don&#039;t care about features, they want stability and security -- Ruby 2.0 is a feature release focusing on features and speed. 1.8 and 1.9 are safer.<br />

				So I checked, and building the libraries is a serious hassle with Ruby 2.0.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I actually had to fix a syntax error in the Ruby header files to get them all to compile... but if you do upgrade to 2.0, and you manage to actually get everything built, it&#039;ll run just fine in either 1.9 or 2.0.

				Er, I haven&#039;t updated the 0.5.2 Makefile -- that&#039;s old, sorry.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to screw with your torrc anymore.&nbsp; You can just type &quot;make gems&quot; and it&#039;ll install the required dependencies.&nbsp; I think by default to avoid requiring privileges, it installs them into your home directory... pretty sure that&#039;s how I set 0.5.2 up anyway.&nbsp; If you still get messages about missing files or something, then just stick them in the system location with &quot;make gems-remote&quot; and it&#039;ll just do a regular install.<br /><br />To be clear, you do not need any special permissions for anything except installing the dependencies (the gems).<br /><br />Oh -- also, if you don&#039;t have Tor running, the program doesn&#039;t do much except fail.&nbsp; It should at least give you an error message though if you&#039;re in Linux... in Windows, if you want console output you have to run it with &quot;ruby&quot; instead of just running &quot;metasilk.rbw&quot;, but in Linux you should be getting a failure message at least.

				SS, I&#039;m still concerned about a fingerprinting attack on this software. It tries to install the following gems from rubygems.org:<br /><br />awesome_print<br />gtk2<br />mechanize<br />nokogiri<br />socksify<br />vrlib<br /><br />I also see it fetching these:<br /><br />pkg-config<br />glib2<br />atk<br />cairo<br />net-http-digest_auth<br />net-http-persistent<br />mime-types<br />ntlm-http<br />webrobots<br />unf_ext<br />unf<br />domain_name<br />require_all<br /><br /><br />If this is the only software in the world that downloads this specific combo of gems, then an attacker with access to the rubygems.org server logs can enumerate the users of this software. Installation on Tails should be fine, because all connections are transparently proxied over Tor. On other Linux distros, you could include instructions to run the make command with torsocks, which should be installed if the headless Tor client is installed. On Windows, I&#039;m not sure what to do. Is there a Windows version of torsocks that can be bundled with it?<br /><br />Edit: I found these, but haven&#039;t tried them...<br /><br />http://www.freehaven.net/~aphex/torcap/<br />https://github.com/cpatulea/TorCap2

				- Gtk2 comes with the Windows installer, and is basically one of the all but 2 choices for stable/mature GUI toolkits.&nbsp; Virtually everyone everywhere who uses Ruby has it.&nbsp; I mean millions and millions of people use Gtk2.&nbsp; It&#039;s what Pidgin uses &amp; requires, as well, BTW.<br /><br />- awesome_print is included in the zip file I posted.&nbsp; As are the ruby bindings for gtk2.&nbsp; Meaning they don&#039;t have to be downloaded from anywhere, they&#039;re already there.<br /><br />- mechanize is also in the zip file and doesn&#039;t have to be downloaded.<br /><br />- socksify is no longer an external dependency, I pulled it in to the project and it&#039;s not external anymore.&nbsp; When it was, it was also included in the zip file.&nbsp; FYI, the only modifications I made were to the event logging mechanism.<br /><br />- vrlib is in there too; no download of that either.<br /><br />I&#039;m grateful for your attention to detail and I&#039;m always open to possible attack vectors, but honest, astor -- the pool of candidates who download the dependencies I don&#039;t include are practically every Ruby user out there.&nbsp; Ruby is currently the 2nd most popular language, depending on who&#039;s list you go by; in other words, they&#039;d have better luck finding us by throwing stones randomly.<br /><br />If you use the &quot;gems-remote&quot; option, which the Makefile does not do unless you specify it manually, then yes, the gems are downloaded from remote storage.&nbsp; But as it turns out, that wasn&#039;t the problem.&nbsp; I should have looked at my own KNOWN_BUGS file: Ubuntu doesn&#039;t come with gtk2-dev, only gtk2.&nbsp; Metasilk requires the gtk2-dev package, since it&#039;s building the GUI code as part of the install process.&nbsp; &quot;apt-get install gtk2-dev&quot; should fix at least that if not everything you saw.<br /><br />It&#039;s almost impossible to plan for every Linux distro and Windows as well.&nbsp; The problems you&#039;re seeing are actually the Ruby guys, not me (though since the program uses Ruby, it&#039;s obviously something I have to deal with as though it were my code).<br /><br />The zip would be about 100mb if I included every last dependency.&nbsp; That&#039;s just overkill, and besides, it still wouldn&#039;t guarantee success -- your compiler version isn&#039;t the same as mine (I don&#039;t use Ubuntu), etc..&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to try and make sure things go smoothly on most distros, but there isn&#039;t really any good way of &quot;fixing&quot; the installation, is what I&#039;m getting at.

				Well, I&#039;ve kind of started uploading a new version every week, and even though my updates aren&#039;t in a &quot;release&quot; worthy state, I put them up there.&nbsp; Mostly because I doubt I&#039;m going to feel like cleaning it up and testing it properly in the next few days, so I may as well.<br /><br />That&#039;s what &quot;unstable&quot; branches/versions are for.&nbsp; Hey, they&#039;re the versions I use, so they aren&#039;t that unstable... :)

				You don&#039;t need to modify the installation script. If torsocks is on the system, start the MetaSilk installation with<br /><br />torsocks make<br /><br />On a Debian based distro, torsocks will be installed with the vanilla Tor client.<br /><br />Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.14), libevent-2.0-5 (&gt;= 2.0.10-stable), libssl1.0.0 (&gt;= 1.0.1), zlib1g (&gt;= 1:1.1.4), adduser, lsb-base<br />Recommends: logrotate, tor-geoipdb, torsocks<br /><br /><br />Anyone who wants to run MetaSilk should have the vanilla client anyway. Running a persistent application through TBB&#039;s Tor is hackish. Plus, the one of the main selling points of a desktop app like MetaSilk is that you don&#039;t need to have a browser open all the time.<br /><br />So, in the README you could include one line that if you want to install over Tor, run torsocks make. Also point out that if installing in Tails (which is quite popular around here), they don&#039;t have to do that because all connections are torified already.<br />

				So here&#039;s the current state of the project: it no longer crashes or freezes in Windows to my knowledge.&nbsp; Admittedly I only bother even using Windows at all to test compatibility with, so my testing isn&#039;t exactly extensive, but the point is that every fatal bug I know of has been addressed.&nbsp; Any that remain I&#039;m not even aware of and should at worst inconvenience the user, not crash the application outright.<br /><br />In Linux, I have tested extensively and over durations of more than 24 hours at a time. The application is rock solid for me and will retry every failed I/O attempt transparently to the calling code until it gets it right (or it encounters an unrecoverable error that isn&#039;t a failed network op like a timeout or something).<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen it retry single GET requests for hours at a time while Tor attempted to build a circuit and reach SR, and it happily waited until the operation was finished successfully before it returned the data requested.&nbsp; In this case it was a search of the entire SR listings database, which ended up dying midway -- but Metasilk faithfully displayed half of it anyway while it kept on trying, finally got the data it asked for, returned it to the calling GUI code, and my list of everything was promptly finished displaying: price-and-category-sorted list in one window of every item for sale.&nbsp; Which did me little good except to have it there to stare at, since I never did get to actually adding anything into your cart from the program.&nbsp; But it was fun to see how well it worked even in the face of a network that crumbled beneath its feet, and to just have that list of every item for sale on SR sorted by price there in front of me too :)<br /><br />It then kept running and updating itself for the next 24 hours without a single issue.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty pleased with it; there are some rough edges and some features that may or may not be of use to some that I didn&#039;t get to, but it does what I set out to make it do and it does that very reliably and very diligently.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t used the site to read or respond to a letter for months, and I probably never will again.&nbsp; Manually encrypt messages with PGP my foot -- that&#039;s for people who don&#039;t code (or know somebody who does, like me)&nbsp; :P<br /><br />In short, it&#039;s not clean and tidy (or as well documented as) the way a general purpose API should be, but I&#039;m satisfied.&nbsp; I find it extremely useful, personally.&nbsp; Infact I&#039;m beyond satisfied given that it&#039;s free.&nbsp; Some guy is selling a stripped down version that doesn&#039;t do half of what mine does for over $50 bucks on SR, did you know that?&nbsp; I sure didn&#039;t until a few days ago when the fucking thing popped up in a search (on an in-my-program search, no less, hah!)<br /><br />If that fucker&#039;s using my early code, I swear I&#039;ll find him and drown him in a pool of rabid ferrets or something, just you wait...!&nbsp; I&#039;m coming for you, Obsidian...<br /><br />... We all know I&#039;m joking, I hope.&nbsp; I mean yeah right, like I&#039;d bother to even if I could find him; I&#039;ll just let him keep ignoring my polite requests to see the code I think I own the copyright for, LOL... it&#039;s cool and all, it happens when you give your stuff away :)<br /><br />If you guys want to toss me a bitcoin here or there for the crazy hours I&#039;ve now put into it -- or even as a means of asking for more stuff added -- I&#039;ll be happy to make it do anything anyone wants to toss me a few coins for.&nbsp; But beyond that, I&#039;m going to focus on something that&#039;ll actually help me get some food in my stomach for the time being.&nbsp; I really can&#039;t afford not to anymore, honestly.<br /><br />It was fun to write it &amp; coordinate with everybody about it, and I may keep doing so occasionally :)&nbsp; I&#039;m not abandoning it by any means, by the way.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that I can&#039;t afford to not get paid for all this coding I do all day long, hah... please do be sure to let me know if you find problems though.&nbsp; I just need to switch gears to more profitable work, that&#039;s all.

				Well, it&#039;s logging in alright for me, but both the primary source (bitcoincharts.com) and the fallback (mtgox.com) are failing to provide the current price of bitcoins.&nbsp; Bitcoincharts.com is giving a 502 error (bad gateway) almost every time, and MtGox is failing the SSL certificate check... don&#039;t know what that&#039;s about.&nbsp; Other than that though, working fine for me.<br /><br />Though I did find a bug... it doesn&#039;t retry a specific operation if it fails during login.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to get to it soon.

				Didn&#039;t you get a Torhost site? Put it on there. Or I can give you an FH invite and you can put it on there. It&#039;s far less likely to disappear.<br />

				No, I had no affiliation with TorShare, which is where I was uploading the stuff.&nbsp; I mean I *could* just find a free clearweb site, but I don&#039;t want to be able to accidentally connect to it via my usual browser.&nbsp; Onion sites for onion business, I guess, heh.

Profiling is a joke, they can&#039;t even profile people correctly at the airports, how are they going to determine one out of the millions of tor users? You think they&#039;re collecting dossiers on everyone who uses tor? So what, this is what you&#039;ve revealed, you are a programmer, you dont like making gui&#039;s, you live in the us, your probably white/asian male, 18-30, you like amphetamines, you use tor....alright that describes about 75% of tor users. For them to find you they would have to eliminate 99.9999% of tor users.

You&#039;re letting fear infect your better judgement. There are no absolutes with power, it is always context dependent,, governments are perceived to be all powerful but this is at least partially based on myth. People are overly impressed by direct forms of power, such as murder and filling cages with people they don&#039;t like. Even at the highest levels and at their most professional they are surrounded by incompetence, it&#039;s the stuff of legend even inside government circles. <br /><br />The record on achieving their most important objectives is simply abysmal. Three examples spring immediately to mind. It took them over a decade to capture the world&#039;s most wanted man. None of their intelligence agencies figured out that Communism was about to suddenly fall, hell, they didn&#039;t even get the big picture about the Russian economy right and the real numbers regarding ICBMs. And the world&#039;s largest and richest superpower lost a war to some of the poorest people on earth.<br /><br />

				Anyone who uses this software is just begging to be busted. It is clearly an LE trojan to circumvent the security of the Tor browser bundle (TBB). Just look at who is doing the review of the source code: eddiethegun, the vendor that doesn&#039;t sell anything illegal, he wouldn&#039;t even ship nightvision items outside the US because it&#039;s illegal without an export license. Also note his email address: nypd@tormail.org. <br /><br />You&#039;ve been warned!

				I had a quick look through the code over the last few days but I&#039;m no expert in that subject by any means... i&#039;m sure that some forum members (myself included) will be relieved to see some higher ranking forum members putting 3r3&#039;s fud to rest ;)

I&#039;d be patenting it and releasing it in the clear with my name and customer service and end up with millions of dollars.&nbsp; Except I offer customer service for this bloody thing too... well I guess I&#039;m just a nice geeky guy who likes helping people, what can I say.<br /><br />So anyway, the program works and you&#039;re more than welcome to use it, but it&#039;s got several unfinished features that will never be finished, the documentation is no longer kept accurate, etc..&nbsp; Also, it contains no malware, and if you don&#039;t believe me or don&#039;t have the skill to read the code yourself... well... I don&#039;t know -- I guess at least don&#039;t blame me for your programming ignorance?
