				I don&#039;t know if this is relevant, but my captcha on silkroad login screen seems to be the same first word every time i try to log in. I mean the numbers change but the word constantly says Beso (Mexican for kiss). So Yeah still cannot log in.

				Also having this issue but not really worried...I&#039;ve been on SR a few months, I&#039;m confident that DPR is ontop of everything. Not to mention, I&#039;ve been in the world of computers (programming mainly) for awhile, and really if I were DPR and I had so many issues with the site going down lately there would be no more SR. I&#039;d say fuck it and let that be that. The very fact that any part of the site or forums is still accessible is astounding to me considering the increased difficulties of working with TOR hidden services, and its part of why I trust DPR to be working on figuring out the issue at the least. Also, I&#039;ve noticed more &quot;SCAM&quot; threads since this issue appeared, I&#039;d just like to say that none of the recent problems seem scammy to me whatsoever...like one person had said, if he were just trying to rip us off for whats in our accounts, everything would be gone already.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=82975.msg617301#msg617301">Quote from: Funbagz on November 23, 2012, 04:34 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t know if this is relevant, but my captcha on silkroad login screen seems to be the same first word every time i try to log in.

				Anyone else noticed you get the same captcha?<br />like constantly I noticed it gives: legs(3number), beso(3number),jay(3numbers), fans(3numbers), marks(3numbers),san(3numbers) or even juno(2numbers), jay(2numbers).<br /><br />Looks like it&#039;s fucked up with the captcha or something.<br /><br />Koelen3.
