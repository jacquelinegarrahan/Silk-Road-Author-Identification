				Guys,<br />I was thinking about the worst scenario, that can happen with SR. The server is found and shutdown, but the guys who run it not caught by LE and can organize another server.<br />So, basically I think it&#039;s a good idea for ppl who love SR and would love to continue their business without building their seller reputation again is to have a way to announce about new SR server in hidden wiki or somewhere else (default point of announcement) and to let ppl know, that new SR is up and running. <br /><br />Of cause admin of new SR must have the same PGP as now to make sure it&#039;s him.<br /><br />What do you think, guys ? <br />Let&#039;s SR admins say something about where these announcements could have place in the worst scenario for SR server (hidden wiki or some hidden forum)?<br />

				maybe someone can figure out how to encrypt the site and it can be served anonymously by users running P2P servers so that their isn&#039;t only 1 server but many servers located everywhere globally.&nbsp; maybe incorporate it into bitcoin clients, lol.

				I think that&#039;s a bit intense.&nbsp; To the best of my knowlege there are constant backups of SR, and one could easily pull the most recent and upload to a new .onion.<br /><br />Also buyers and sellers both can verify their identies with their PGP keys.&nbsp; You are the only one who has the private key so someone could send you me a PGP message, for instance, to see if I actually AM Anarcho47 and I could respond with proof.<br /><br />Keep your PGP contacts backed up, they are one of the keys to being able to transfer your rep over in case of a serious emergency.&nbsp; You can also use your PGP key to verify your identity on alternate selling sites (as a seller, that is).

				This is a really good idea and I actually like the peer 2 peer idea. I wonder how complex that would be to implement.<br /><br />Any techie guys?
