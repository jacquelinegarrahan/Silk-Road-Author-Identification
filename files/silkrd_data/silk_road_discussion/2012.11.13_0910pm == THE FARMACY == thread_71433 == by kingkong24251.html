				ALRIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. IT&#039;S BEEN 2+ WEEKS SINCE ORDERING TO TRANSIT TO WAITING AND STILL WAITING FOR MY PACKAGE. Website is STILL down, still haven&#039;t received my package. I spent 400$+ and FE&#039;d so I&#039;m pretty much FUCKED in the ass. Doesn&#039;t seem like he wants to reply to my forum messages, and he doesn&#039;t make ANY incentive on wanting to check forums after website has been down. JUST RIDICULOUS! IM GOING NUTS. <br /><br /><br />HAS anyone ordered with this dude, and had to wait more then a WEEK in the US for shipping? I mean WHAT GOES

				Being 100% honest here. I waited nearly 2 weeks for my 5gs of wax. The guy needs to pick his customer service up, no doubt. But The Farmacy is the real deal and proved to me to be legit. More than once.

				i ordered from him a few weeks ago and it took 15-16 days to arrive (US). just give it some more time and relax while you wait. i was worried for a while too because he didn&#039;t respond to my PM (about the package not arriving after 2 weeks) but it came just a day or two after i sent him the message.<br /><br />you should be ok.
