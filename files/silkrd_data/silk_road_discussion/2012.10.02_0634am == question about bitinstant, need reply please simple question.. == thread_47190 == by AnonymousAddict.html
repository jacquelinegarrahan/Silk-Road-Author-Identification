				Yep, sounds like enough time. Except when I buy bitcoins, I usually like to wash them a bit...(I&#039;m a tad paranoid...)&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;ve only deposited money into my blockchain.info account using bitinstant (moneygram) and that is always within an hour. Bitinstant is definitely the easiest way, I wish you could just order some with a debit/credit card that would be so much more convenient.<br />When I transfer money from my Blockchain wallet to SR though it always takes HOURS. I think if you deposit it directly though it shouldn&#039;t take that long..<br /><br />Let us know if it worked out / How long it took will you?

				Ok heres the deal, i deposited the cash today using my sr address, i went to blockchain and put in my address to make sure it had been recieved. Blockchain shows my SR address i put in to check that it did in fact add money, but no coins have been sent to SR yet? WTF? IS THIS NORMAL? at the bottom of blockchaiin it says the amount of money i added to the sr address i put in and thn in blue says 1 confirmation, how long til coins show on SR?

				I can usually deposit cash at a major bank and have it sent directly to my bitcoin wallet and it&#039;s usually done within 30 minutes....then I send it to my SR account and it usually takes another 30 minutes...so around 1 hour.

				We used Bitinstant to initially fund our vendor account and have recommended it to several clients. Just be patient. The system works great - your coins will show up.&nbsp; 8)<br />.Hades.

				Here&#039;s what I did...<br /><br />1. Did a money order to bitinstant (they use ZipZap to process it).<br />2. By the time I got home the BTC was already in my wallet.<br />3. Transferred to my anon wallet on blockchain.info<br />4. Paid blockchain.info 1.5% to use their anon function when depositing to SR<br /><br />blockchain.info&#039;s anon sending function tumbles your BTC so it&#039;s impossible to tell who you sent BTC to.<br />Then SR tumbles again, which is cool.<br /><br />I think I did it right.&nbsp; ;)

				Thanks guys everything went fine, It took about 3 hrs but bitinstant said they had a delay and they messed something up, they got tec support and within 10 min i saw activity on blockchain.. I have a blockchain wallet also but i dont use it, i just send straight to SR cause as some one said soon as i add them and they show up they go to someone else anyway, i used another place one time and it was a hassel then found bitinstant, i think is the best an cheapest!! I need to start putting a xtra 30bucks on at a time then what i do cause right after i orderd my stuff it left me with a little left over but just a dollar or 2 short from anything good i wanted, SO from now on xtra 20 or 30 always will be put on there
