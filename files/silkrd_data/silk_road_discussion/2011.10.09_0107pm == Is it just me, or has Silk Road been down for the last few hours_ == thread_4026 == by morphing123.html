				I had to put up a private listing before 7:00 am Mountain time, about 25 minutes ago, and after a brief hiccup signing in, had no problem at all.<br /><br />It&#039;s still up for me now, albeit a little slow, but that&#039;s nothing new.

				It&#039;s back up for me. Someone should develop a www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com equivalent for .onion sites.

				Why would Anonymous attack SR??&nbsp; Its not like SR is the governments operation or trying to repress anyone or has CP on it...&nbsp; that just don&#039;t make sense.&nbsp; If anything we&#039;re closer to being on their team than on the governments side.&nbsp; Hell, they should be helping us... were just trying to allow people to make their own choices with regard to self medication instead of the government telling us what we can and can&#039;t do.<br /><br />Paperchasing

				Anon had *nothing* to do with this. The message from SR is *3 MONTHS OLD* for f__Ks sake. <br /><br />This is a psy-op against the SR and Anon communities, trying to pit them against each others.<br /><br />Look, a weak DoS did happen, and it was timed to occur at the same time as this new hoax message. It is a co-ordinated attack, but the attack has nothing to do with CP *or* Anon. Its all about causing suspicion and paranoia. It *almost* worked.<br /><br />Look at this paste-bin, from a day before the messages popped up at SR: http://pastebin.com/bgY3KFpx&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;--- this is the original carbon copy and very fake. Google this:&nbsp; &quot; This was very unnerving because we&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;-- to see the original 3 month old message from SR.<br /><br />Besides, Anon would never do a release like this. I&#039;ll leave to you to draw you own conclusions who would devise such an attack. I personaly don&#039;t think the religious anti-drug crowd has the brains or resources... Smells a little LE.. defintly not the average troll.
