Do you know how much time and effort goes into each package to ensure that it arrives safely? Or have any idea of the time it takes to drop off packages in different locations for safety reasons? Vendors practically lose money on samples. Why would a vendor want to lose money when they already have a well established customer base buying larger amounts?!&nbsp; ??? They don&#039;t need to sell sample amounts precisely BECAUSE they know their product is good.<br /><br />10 BTC may be a large amount for you to risk on something you&#039;ve never sampled, but would you risk 2 BTC? Equally, 2 BTC may be a large amount for someone else to risk on something they&#039;ve never sampled. Where do we draw the line? 10 BTC / $100+/- would be about the price I&#039;d expect to pay for any sample I buy if I&#039;m intending on buying large amounts. Vendors get people every single day asking for samples promising to buy larger amounts once they&#039;ve tried the product. 99.9% of these people have no intention of doing so. The other 0.01% that do intend to buy larger quantities will be able to afford to pay for a decent sized sample.<br /><br />This is an underground drug market, not eBay - do your due diligence, research your vendor thoroughly before you order, never Finalise Early, and if you feel you&#039;ve been wronged, bring the matter to the Resolution Center. There&#039;s no reason that a vendor should have to list sample amounts except when they&#039;re starting out. Most dealers on the streets wouldn&#039;t give out small samples for you to test because the risk:reward ration is too small. This is the same, except the dealer&#039;s (vendor&#039;s) costs are usually higher.

				The honest vendors don&#039;t fake there feedback, if your still unsure use the forums to research your vendor all you need to know is on here, besides there&#039;s nothing stopping the bad vendor sending out good quality sample products then there shit product for main order.

				All fair points but yeah i do have an idea of the work it takes as i am a vendor lol<br /><br />And what I do is offer a tier system - the more you buy the cheaper it gets but I sell samples at higher price to cover my aditional costs and time.<br /><br />

				Most vendors offer samples to get them started, after that it&#039;s not worth the time to go through and make small orders for minimal gain. if you are looking to order bulk I am sure a vendor will be able to send you a sample, but you are going to have to pay for it. don&#039;t expect something for free, and don&#039;t pester a vendor unless you are ready to place a bulk order. Otherwise use the forum and read all the feedback to make an informed purchase.

				Although I understand where OP is coming from, wanting to sample a product before buying it, especially if it high priced, you need to look at it from the other side and the situation you&#039;re in - you&#039;re buying drugs from a drug dealer. You&#039;d never ask a drug dealer for a sample of his goods before buying, and it&#039;s considered taboo to ask for smaller amounts than what he offers.<br /><br />But on the plus side, with Silk Road you have both a feedback system AND a forums, so it&#039;s much more unlikely for a dealer to be hocking fake/low quality wares.<br /><br />Then again I&#039;m speaking as a vendor of products that are not only cheap, but who&#039;s profit margins are massive, so doing samples is just too much of a pain in the arse to even care about..I can imagine people who aren&#039;t making much profit and so depend on as much business as possible to see this as a viability.<br /><br />Also, with my product being so cheap, doing samples would mean the postage would cost more than the product ha.

				This is how I view samples:<br />Hello officer, would you like to try a sample? I will send you one for free right away so you can narrow down my location np!<br /><br />Hello potential bulk buyer, would you like to try a sample to see if you like my goods and promise you&#039;ll buy bulk later? Okay np! I mean if you promise to buy in bulk later I&#039;ll send a sample for free np!<br /><br /><br />Vendors please don&#039;t give out samples, it&#039;s bad for business. This is why we have rep, the other day I refused to send some guy a sample and he got offended. Check my feedback, go to the forum and check there just in case and if you still don&#039;t want to take a risk then don&#039;t buy the product, that simple.

				There&#039;s also the thing that samples shouldn&#039;t be needed unless it is to establish yourself, because once you&#039;ve conquered that hurdle and people know your shit is legit and getting regular business, which started off as a first time purchase&nbsp; because of the previous dedicated buyers...<br /><br />It&#039;s almost like going to a restaurant that has awesome reviews but you&#039;re unwilling to order anything until you try somehing from the behind the scenes.<br /><br />

				I think that in samples are a good way to prove your products are the real deal, but I agree that once you have shown that, your reputation and feedback should be sufficient.

				Some drug dealers i know of do give samples, but these samples are purchased, if someone has drugs to sell, there was risks taken and money invested somewhere along the line, drugs ain&#039;t free.<br /><br />The reputation and feedback plus the forums should be more than enough for you to make a decision if you should trust a seller on quality. Maybe have a chat to the seller to see what the smallest quantity you can buy?<br /><br />

Put a small listing that would cost twice as much as if they purchased bulk. If they really want to test it out they will but it and test it.

				It could be a security compromise to have vendors sending lots more packages with little added benefit for the risk they&#039;re taking. <br />The vendors for whom samples would be most applicable (ounce/kilo) also realize that the best way to stay in the game is to be on the field as little as possible unless for big plays, so to speak.
