				was just wondering if if a vedor account can allow two logins simultaneously so two pcs can work in the same account at the same time - so one guy can do messages and one can do orders? if not can somebody suggest another alternative?

				I believe it is possible or it was at least possible about 3 months back. Recent attacks and the changes needed to mitigate any future attacks may have changed this though..

				in what way is it disconcerting? as in communication between your buddy? <br /><br />what if you are both in the same room, stick to your roles eg. 1 man messages, 1 man orders proccessing and you just say &quot;hey guy on order rahrah rah says this for order &quot;rahrah&quot; -so the message guy isn&#039;t fooling around in the order/processing guys business? like how a tradion one room office might operate.<br /><br />...its just i heard of a vendor farm out his ordering to another vendor account and just thought that separating messsages/orders and shipping details to entitrely separate accounts would be complete insanity - open to reasons why it may not though

Example: T5 as the main account. My and my partner can log in the main account with info such as T5_Admin, with all the power that comes with the usual vendor account. Then we could have other sub accounts such as T5_messages that only get access to the message section, but nothing else, then T5_Orders for the people who fill orders sheets for shipping department...and etc.<br /><br />What do you think, is this something that would actually be worth something to improve vendors&#039; service...?

				It&#039;s neat how when the road is working as it should all of these ideas for improvement start mushrooming.<br />Subaccounts for vendors is a pretty good idea, give your sub access just to answer messages and such.

				yeah i was just refering to one single vending account but having ya coworker be able to sit in his/her computer and go thru messages while you do orders on your computer.<br /><br />i mean surely big boys like supertrips have to have some way of running the show.. surely one guy cant be doing all the work with these hundred order a day plus type shows! if you had 1000 emails to answer a day and 500 orders to fill you&#039;d really need to partition it out. multiple logins on an single account would be the only way i could see people staying sane.<br /><br />if you guys know the situation like &quot;mimm and going postal &quot; how mimm takes orders and goingpostal ships.... well that method seems like business insanity to me..

I open multiple pages on SR all the time. All the second PC needs is the session info. I&#039;m not sure if SR puts session info into a cookie or ? You could try it.

				i was thinking this while vending, why should i have to send customer info to my shipping dept in another state when i could just have them login and do it, but i dont trust my shipping people enough to give them the keys to my car. Also it would be nice to have someone help you out with order processing without giving them complete control of everything.
