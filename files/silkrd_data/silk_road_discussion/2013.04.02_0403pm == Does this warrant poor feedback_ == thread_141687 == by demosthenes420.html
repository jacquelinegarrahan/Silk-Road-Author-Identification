				I am new to SR, and so I&#039;m looking for a little bit of help deciding on feedback for a recent purchase. I have made three purchases that all went without a hitch, and the purchase in question is my fourth. On the vendor&#039;s page, the vendor stated ...<br /><br />&quot;All orders are shipped within 48 hours of order. Period. &quot;<br /><br />but when I placed the order this is what actually happened...<br /><br />ordered: March 27, 2013, 10:34 pm UTC<br />shipped: March 30, 2013, 7:27 am UTC<br /><br />Now, I would not normally be so niggardly as to make a fuss about a 9 hour delay past what the vendor states they can do except for two reasons... 1. This delay in shipping was on a holiday weekend and due to the delay, rather than getting timely delivery on a priority post package this package is now going to take an inordinately long amount of time to be delivered. Not a huge deal, but frustrating. 2. This vendor offered &quot;something special&quot; for the first 20 buyers. Now the vendor has 30+ feedback ratings, most of which stated they ordered significantly later than I did. I could be jumping the gun on this one because I haven&#039;t received the package yet, but when I do receive the package I will be more than a little pissed if I DIDN&#039;T make the first 20 cut due to a delay in shipping time outside what the vendor states they would do.<br /><br />So... Is this breach in what a new vendor stated they could/would do worthy of a reduction in feedback? Or should they get a 5/5 with simply a little comment in the feedback section? I&#039;ve read through many feedback threads and have seen the two basic arguments... 1. Seller feedback is critical to them and if you get a product that is reasonable you should not ding their feedback. and 2. Be honest, if there are problems your feedback should reflect it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to be a stingy bastard about feedback and possibly hurt a new seller, but I&#039;m also a big believer in &quot;under promise and over deliver&quot; and this was a breach of what the vendor stated as policy, and it&#039;s a breach that may have material consequences (won&#039;t know until receipt). Obviously I&#039;m just looking at the shipping portion of this transaction as I haven&#039;t yet received the package. Thoughts?

				Wait for it to arrive, if you are not happy with the overall delivery time and/or product bring it up with the vendor. If they are unresponsive or rude then a 4/5 is reasonable, but as this is a new seller I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll apologise, offer an explanation and maybe a discount on future buys. If this happens give the a 5/5 and explain what happened in the feedback.<br />A 4/5 will bring their stats down significantly as a new vendor, wait until it arrives and you speak to them before deciding feedback.<br />All the best.

				Good call, that was about what I was thinking. Don&#039;t want to be brutal but also have to be honest, one of the reasons I tried a new vendor was the free goodies for the first 20 customers! and its hard to know you ordered a week ago and watch people that ordered 3 days ago getting their packages and leaving feedback while your still waiting and they&#039;re talking about lightning shipping speeds!

				Personally, before I knew about the feedback system I would leave a 4/5. However, being a vendor now, and knowing how weird and unfair (Sorry SR) the feedback system is I always leave 5/5 unless there is a huge problem with the order.<br /><br />And always, always, ALWAYS, contact the vendor first allow him/her to rectify the situation (or at least give him/her a chance)

				Since you re kind of new to sr, i will give you an advice.<br /><br />1. Always try talking to the vendor before leaving him less than 5/5. Feedback is all and especially to those vendors who re just starting. People make honest mistakes and sometimes take longer than expected. I had an order with a very well known top vendor for almost 3 months, he took ages to ship 25.000tabs of 25INBOMe. I still left him 5/5 even though it took so fucking long, if the vendor is responsive and tries to make it up for you, just leave him 5/5. If he is a douchebag and tells you to fuck off, then you leave him bad feedback. <br />Remember we re all humans and sometimes make mistakes, you need to give them a chance to explain before fucking their feedback up.

				Given the critical flaw in SR&#039;s rating weight, there&#039;s essentially only 1/5 or 5/5. Forget about the ones in between. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t eBay. It&#039;s a black market. If you get what you ordered, 5/5. If you don&#039;t 1/5.&nbsp; After being here for well over a year, that&#039;s really it. Everything else, as mentioned, can be resolved by contacting the vendor and being human and treat them as humans. <br /><br />And whatever you do, don&#039;t blackmail a vendor using feedback. That will get you on SR vendor&#039;s private black list. You could end up having vendors not accept your order or sending you bottom shelf product. Vendors hate those people. Considering the difficulty being a vendor on SR, it&#039;s easy to see why they would hate that kind of person. Sometimes us buyers think that using feedback blackmail is the only way to get what we want because some of these vendors do come off as pricks. But they come off as pricks because some buyers, especially new ones, pull some crazy stunts to try to get what they want or get one over on the vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I agree what others have said and see what the will do for you before leaving negative feedback. Because even if something goes screwy and he/she works with you than he still deserves good feedback. <br /><br />But good for you not assuming the vendor is a jerk and coming on and asking before you leave feedback. Some people will just leave negative feedback without ever contacting the vendor to give him/her a chance to resolve the situation. <br /><br />You still have too wait and see when you get it, what the quality is, how good the stealth is etc... <br /><br />But you have a good positive attitude and a desire to be fair that will ultimately lead to a good relationship with many vendors.<br /><br />Of course if it takes forever to get to you and the vendor is impossible to deal with than its a different story.<br /><br />Keep us informed how things go. <br /><br />If everything ends up good you should consider starting a review thread for the vendor if there isn&#039;t already one.

				I think you should Google UDT Time Convertsion.<br />And actually see what time it is by your home compaired to what time SR thinks it is....<br />Then you should stop to think &quot;Could said 9hours have happened because of the Vendor&#039;s Geographic Location in comparison to your own.&quot;<br /><br />Also I noticed you said this is like your 4th order from the guy right? If so... you should respect him.<br />Or did you mean that you&#039;ve only done 4 transactions on SR? If so stop ordering from vendors until you&#039;ve actually found them on SR Forums and research them.<br /><br />If you plan to leave poor feedback I suggest you Contact your Vendor first.<br />Discuss the problem and attempt a personal resolution.<br />I can tell you for a fact that in the Vendor Roundtable forum (restricted access), Usernames pop up on the BlackList all day long because the BUYER left poor feedback without contacting the vendor first.<br /><br />I try to always remember that I am not ordering from Amazon.com and that a complaint of &quot;1/5 pills were smooshed&quot; is absolutely Assanine and those whom are leaving such feedback need to take mom&#039;s nipple from their mouths.<br /><br />Always remember that 1/5 is what you would rate somebody who STOLE from you because it is the Lowest score.<br />Therefor you should NEVER EVER rate somebody close to 1/5 if the drugs actually arrived.

				Not withstanding that this is not eBay there are some vendors who need an attitude adjustment. I have seen vendors post that if it gets to you ( even if weeks late) and the quality is crap I am entitled to my 5/5. There are vendors who won&#039;t answer any inquiries at all. Just want you to FE and go away.<br /><br />Not every vendor feels that way of course. There are plenty that are great here. Unfortunately the all or nothing rating prevents people from seeing vendors that truly deserve that A+ rate. <br /><br />There is an art to successful selling on line. The merchandise sells its self. What people here are paying over double street value is quality and service. Not everyone has the right personality to sell on line. It is not easy as it does take an organized person with good communication to make it a success.<br /><br />I think as the site grows you will see a lot less all or nothing ratings. People will start rating a transaction 3/5 or 4/5 based on shipping and communication, stealth,FE etc. And in a way thats a good thing. True first rate sellers deserve top billing. They work hard for.<br /><br />With that said you should always work things out with a vendor if you can. Screw up&#039;s should be rare but they do happen even with the best vendors. So give them a chance to fix the problem before leaving feedback. <br /><br />This guy has not said anything about black mailing a vendor or any thing like that. He kind of jumped the gun a bit worrying about being scammed this early. But, just because a vendor marked an item in transit that does not mean it is. <br /><br />At least he is asking questions to learn how to handle the situation if things go wrong.

				You should not get negative feedback on neither of those based on what you described. Those sound like the same thing as buyers doing screwy things with mailing addresses causing packages to be undeliverable. You shipped to the address you were given. <br /><br />Situations like this are when it is not fair that vendors can&#039;t give feedback to buyers or at least write a response if negative feedback is left.

				Well, This particular vendor, who is getting a 5/5, sent me 33% more weight than I ordered, and the product was good, so my feedback will reflect the slight delay in shipping but as they are as new as I am I think overall they performed well. This thread was more about getting a feel for what other people think. I know it would be complicated but wouldn&#039;t it be neat if there were actually multiple categories to rate on? Shipping, Stealth, Communication and Quality? Make it so feedback is actually meaningful! Anyway thanks all for your thoughts on the issue, this particular vendor came through for me!<br /><br />I&#039;m still in shock there is a good, reliable source of party favors!<br /><br />Peace.
