				Technically, you&#039;re currently ALLOWED to do that ... but it&#039;s not recommended due to the issues RoxiPal and NCK mentioned.

				If it is hosted in any country that is even friendly with the US you&#039;ll still be screwed if they want you.<br />MP is a US only thing also, so they can definitely get your information even if they have to go through an extra channel. (like getting that website shut down financially or threatening to if they don&#039;t give you up)<br /><br />Definitely not a good idea at all. MP is only anonymous for the buyer (and even then, cameras) and not really at all for whoever is actually using the funds.<br />
