				That was me being calm. <br /><br />And what you said was not a question..it was you making a statement that you THOUGHT was correct.<br /><br />But of course ....like a lot of things you say...it was totally wrong!<br /><br />Though you would not know that because YOU do not have access. <br /><br />I would suggest that you spend your time trying to be a good vendor and not trying to talk shit to or about other vendors. <br /><br />
