				I know some vendors can go into stealth mode but I don&#039;t understand exactly how it works.<br />&nbsp;How can I find listed items from stealth mode vendor that I have made many orders with and no problems ever? If I have good stats and such can I also access a vendor I never bought from who went stealth?<br />&nbsp;Also, if a vendor is in stealth will it be indicated in the profile or just show them having no active listings? I see 1 vendor who I dealt with who&#039;s profile says in stealth mode but not sure if all vendors in stealth say that or if it was some optional thing. Also, that vendor in stealth I can&#039;t find how to see the stealth listings they have.<br />

				If a vendor is in stealth mode you wont be able to find items listed from that vendor, you would have to be given the link to the vendor. It will be indicated in their profile if they&#039;re in stealth mode.&nbsp; It&#039;s not an option for them to turn off that notice, as far as i know. Become a fan of a vendor, then if the vendor goes into stealth mode you&#039;ll still have access to their listings. If you want to do business&nbsp; with a vendor for the first time and they&#039;re in stealth mode, it should say on their vendor page if you can do business with them or not. More than likely, you can.&nbsp; That vendor in stealth you&#039;ve done business with before, try to message then and see if they will give you the link to their vendor page. Hope this helps.
