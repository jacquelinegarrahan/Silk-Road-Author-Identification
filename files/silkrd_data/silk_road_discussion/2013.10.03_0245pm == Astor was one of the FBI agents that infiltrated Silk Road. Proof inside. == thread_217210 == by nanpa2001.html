				Astor was a &#039;helpful&#039; poster that ingratiated himself into DPR&#039;s confidences, and was acknowledged by DPR as being helpful. Astor is one of 3 FBI agents that had infiltrated Silk Road before it was taken down. Astor was involved in the second &#039;assassination&#039; ordered by DPR.<br /><br />Here are the players: FBI agent 1 is &quot;Friendly Chemist&quot;. He starts the process by blackmailing DPR.<br />FBI agent 2 is astor. <br />FBI agent 3 is &quot;redandwhite&quot;, the &#039;hit man&#039;.<br /><br />The first agent creates the problem, the trusted and helpful second agent introduces a problem solver, and the third agent resolves the problem in order to gain trust.<br /><br />At the point this starts the FBI already has access to the SR servers, and all the usernames and communications. Agent 1 uses this information to blackmail DPR, providing proof that he has many usernames and addresses, and demanding $500 000 in return for not releasing Silk Road customer information, the release of which could destroy Silk Road (according to DPR). This is called &#039;creating the problem&#039;. Agent 1 in the meantime made a fake purchase on using his SR account, and that includes his &#039;real&#039; name and address. Of course, no such person actually exists, and this transaction has been made so that DPR would discover the name and address.<br /><br />Agent 2 (astor), known to be of assistance to DPR in the past talks to DPR over the site infrastructure, and DPR confides to agent 2 about his problem with the blackmailer. DPR reveals to agent 2 that he knows the name and address of the blackmailer. Agent 2 then tells DPR that he knows someone that can fix problems like this. This person he introduces DPR to is agent 3.<br /><br />DPR contacts agent 3 and agent 3 negotiates a price with DPR, and then &#039;kills&#039; agent 1. Agent 1 simply disappears and no longer bothers DPR. Now agent 2 and agent 3 are very high in the confidence of DPR, and are among his closest advisers. Around this time DPR made a semi-public announcement of appreciation for the work that agent 2 (astor) was doing for Silk Road.<br /><br />Now heavily in the confidence of DPR having solved the problem that they created in the first place, DPR was now using agent 3 to purchase fake identity documents, documents that were of course intercepted and led the authorities straight to his residence, and his real identity. What happens next is well known to everyone here.<br /><br />This operation was a crucial part of determining DPR&#039;s real life identity, and agent 2 (astor) was the most critical and determined agent in making the operation to capture DPR a success. Similar operations are run on the Klan all the time by FBI infiltrators. The infiltrators are always the most &#039;helpful&#039; members offering to resolve problems.<br /><br />I know that astor is just doing his job and it is important that Silk Road users know the truth about what happened. If you lost any money here, it is largely thanks to his work. Still, almost all of the users are oblivious to astor&#039;s role in this, which is a credit to his skills as an undercover agent.<br /><br />Any future underground market will have to be vigilant and look out for the warning signs. If not for my article today, astor may have even come back to bring down another website.

				If this is true, your story, and the ones ive read dont add up (like every fucking thing today)<br /><br />The complaint said DPR requested that agent 1 tell his supplier to contact him, so how does agent 2 magically become agent 1? And if I remember correctly, DPR suggested the hit, not agent 2. And what about the previous 80k head he had? is that agent 0? If you ask me, DPR fucked up the only real rule to never break when you&#039;re in the game. Dont trust a fucking soul, everyones going to fuck you, sooner or later. What matters is how you take the bang. IF i was DPR I would hire at the very least 3 lawyers, which he should have on retainer if he has .03 cents of a brain. He&#039;ll need a criminal justice lawyer, a geeky one, and a medical one to prolong his case due to &quot;health problems&quot; until its thrown out. It only take about 100k to have a case last years. But really, what charges are going to stick? As far as I know he&#039;s not a vendor, he sells a business, essentially. Commission for escrow. He may be a hacker but he did not hack into anything illegal pertaining to SR. And He&#039;s definitely not laundering money, has anyone here bought anything on SR with federal &quot;money&quot;? I&#039;ve only used BitCoin. The Murder-4-Hire on the other hand may be a bit tricky to loophole

				I&#039;ve been collecting my thoughts over this tragedy. I may have some final things to say, but I don&#039;t feel like dealing with this bullshit.<br /><br />One of the few things that they admitted in the criminal complaint that actually work is PGP, and that was the biggest thing I advocated in my time here. If I was LE and everyone had taken my advice, then I would have fucked my own investigation. Instead, they have 1.2 million unencrypted messages and who knows how many unencrypted addresses. If the server was being watched since July, they may also have thousands of addresses that are encrypted that would have otherwise been unencrypted, if it wasn&#039;t for the efforts of myself and others to challenge people to increase their security.<br /><br />You can believe what you want. I&#039;m just an anonymous dude on the internet.<br />

				If you ask me, this is absolutely absurd!!!!<br /><br />Firstly, you must give reasoning for such an accusation like this. Anyone can post a theory without any supporting evidence and gain as much belief as this. If you&#039;re truly serious then you&#039;ll explain where you got this from?<br /><br />The way I see this OP is that he is in fact an agent and is trying to discredit someone who as been an OUTSTANDING contribution to all that&#039;s gone on here for all of us and making people weary of him and blacken his name.<br /><br />I refuse to even consider believing this without some solid proof for concern (which i&#039;m sure we&#039;ll never see)<br /><br />My advice here to everybody is don&#039;t believe any of these speculation bullshit posts. Even what you&#039;re reading about DPR&#039;s arrest.<br /><br />Media are the last i&#039;d believe about anything and for all we know, the details of his arrest and reason for being caught are complete bullshit and just put out to make people think it was because of stupid mistakes he made (which again, seems very unlikely considering his knowledge)<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot more to this than meets the eye and just everyone be cautious about their actions.<br /><br /><br />Rant over :P<br />

If I was LE and everyone had taken my advice, then I would have fucked my own investigation. Instead, they have 1.2 million unencrypted messages and who knows how many unencrypted addresses. If the server was being watched since July, they may also have thousands of addresses that are encrypted that would have otherwise been unencrypted, if it wasn&#039;t for the efforts of myself and others to challenge people to increase their security.<br /><br />You can believe what you want. I&#039;m just an anonymous dude on the internet.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You may remember, back about a year ago, there was an Aussie dude (Winters86) who said his family were all upper-echelon police officers.&nbsp; He claimed to have seen a report on Silk Road, and the gist of that report was that the one thing that the police feared most was that people would begin to learn and use software like PGP. As he stated in his post: <br /><br />1. PGP is terrifying them, every new user who learns it and helps others learn, closes a possible loophole they where planning to exploit. <br /><br />2. User ignorance of the technology being used (Tor, PGP etc) is the their single best hope for any kind of serious action against the SR community.<br /><br />This was over a year ago, that Winters86 pointed this out. <br /><br />A little over a year ago, I had an argument with another user over the terms in the Seller&#039;s Guide. I interpreted the terms as stating that vendors were required to use PGP, while the other person said that was not the case. DPR eventually weighed in, and sided with the other party, to my very great dismay. <br /><br />As much as parties like RxKing may have argued (and STILL argue) against its use, if use of PGP had been mandatory on SR, then the police would most certainly NOT be having the field day that they are now. The entire idea behind advocating PGP was as protection or insurance in case the server were ever seized or compromised, which is the _exact_ situation we&#039;re facing now.&nbsp; The people who used proper opsec (unlike DPR) have relatively little to fear. Astor, Guru, myself and others put in a lot of time trying to evangelize PGP, because it&#039;s effective -- it works. If Astor were truly a cop, he wouldn&#039;t be advocating use of a tool that would make their lives considerably harder<br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090 <br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

				What OP said makes sense, and I can see why he suspects astor is one of the agents. Until there is proof, it&#039;s really not fair to say it was him though. There are lots of candidates just from the forums alone.<br /><br />The tactic he described is indeed used to bait suspects into further incriminating themselves. Google the recent bust of a man intending to use x-ray devices to kill Muslims. IIRC, the FBI was also involved and they played that guy in a very similar manner.

				Kmfkw is definitely suspect, astor as well. I have no proof, but my intuition tells me someone prominent on this thread could also be LE.<br />I have no proof, so I won&#039;t call out any names that haven&#039;t been called out already. Point of the matter is, TRUST NO ONE. <br /><br />Their modus operendi seems to be: show great technical knowledge, make major contributions for free, gain a reputation as a valuable member of the community, gain the trust, and go for the kill!<br /><br />IMPORTANT:&nbsp; There was a cocaine vendor on here called &quot;Nob&quot; (not to be confused with nod). My intuition told me he was LE from the beginning. Apparently DPR was brokering a cocaine deal with someone, I believe this someone was nob. Nob claimed he knew DPR personally and they were doing a deal together. He was also selling kilo quantities of cocaine on SR on a new account. Then on the vendor forum, a guy name googleyed1 claimed he not only got ripped off by Nob but much worse. Nob did his deals by storing the &quot;product&quot; in a self storage unit whereby the buyer had to go pick it up. I think a bust happened that googleyed1 didn&#039;t want to talk about.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to find the thread. But I think SS was DPR and it all started from there.<br /><br />UPDATE: I found the thread:&nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120169.0<br />Nob contacted DPR to find a buyer for bulk coke. DPR contacted googleyed1 and gave him BTC to buy the coke and receive it at his house. Nob who was an undercover LE, sent the &quot;coke&quot;, a controlled delivery was done and googleyed1 was busted. DPR thought googleyed1 was going to talk to LE so he hired nob to have him killed. Nob sent him fake photos of the killing and got paid the balance.

				*facepalm*<br /><br />Some of you really are stupid to give the slightest bit of credence to this idea of Astor being LE.<br /><br />Point of fact; DPR turned out to be an arrogant, flighty-headed prick with delusions of grandeur, who thought he was untouchable. If he had followed the basic advice Astor and others had recommended, the greatest cyber black market would still be here with LEO&#039;s best efforts wasted on picking off low hanging fruit.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />DPR taking one for the team, killed the whole damn franchise - making mistakes that most of us vendors never would have. <br /><br />His geekness seemed to make him forget what this place was first and foremost, a black market. What, with his attempts at making the place more user friendly and amazon-like. Adding stupid, fucking features most vendors hated all the while ignoring features vendors needed. It&#039;s clear he was soaking up the San Fran cyber vibe and forgetting that this is a black market for hard fucking drugs and not some hipster bazaar. <br /><br />All that coin in commissions went towards what? Opsec? Nope. No fucking way. Not even 1% was devoted to Opsec. All that coin went into a black hole of wishful, flighty thinking. <br /><br />Could SR have lasted forever? No. But it could have lasted a lot longer. That much is clear. And in better hands, it could have been formidable. <br /><br />At least on the other markets that exist, buyers will smarten up and realize that they are operating in a black market with black market players and not doing business on Amazon or ebay. Now at least they will have more realistic expectations. Something DPR failed to instill considering he lead by example after all.

				astor has done more to promote the use of PGP than anyone else here. He also strongly advocated Tor for everything. Had DPR followed astor&#039;s advice then there would&#039;ve been no way to find the physical location of the SR servers and the site would never have been compromised. The special agent&#039;s affidavit showed that DPR logged into the site as an admin many times without Tor and that made it a cinch for LE to locate the servers. God fucking damnit! It&#039;s so unbelievably stupid and sloppy that it makes the official story suspect. Only it&#039;s not. The allegation is highly improbable and I strongly doubt any proof will ever surface that would support it.

				i mean i guess we wont find that out for awhile, i read one report that DPR was actually communicating to what he thought was a trusted source who was actually a rat that turned his info over to the FBI, i mean i guess we wont know til more implications are made, im just wondering to see what if anything DPR says to the LE, cause im sure he holds a substantial amount of info so im wondering how that is all going to pan out for him. but i dont know who was involved , or really the exact story the only part that seems to keep popping up is the murder for hire not once but twice apparently, but besides that the details are so muddy and unclear and with all these theories makes the water even more murky to who is what and that is what we deal with on the underground sites many dont know who many are thats the point of these markets which is its beauty but in rare occasions can suck when we are trying to figure out who can be trusted and who cant so we probably wont find out who the rats are until they are attempting to taking down Sheep Market and BMR, and sadly to say im sure they are working on that anyway cause im sure they are on these forums and following the rest of this awesome community to the other sites, its a shame that we have to deal with others that try to live by such strict rules and standards and dont allow the rest of us to enjoy the true freedoms and beauties the world has to offer , hopefully someday all will change

Then on the vendor forum, a guy name SelfSovereignty claimed he not only got ripped off by Nob but much worse.

				I can find no mention of FC having made any purchases although he was apparently a vendor[*]. None of that would explain, however, how DPR would know that he had &quot;Wife + 3 kids&quot;, as he allegedly told redandwhite at the end of March, as claimed on Page 22 of the complaint.<br /><br />[*] And I&#039;ll ask again, does _anyone_ here remember a vendor by the name of FriendlyChemist?

				I feel like it is premature and somewhat naive to accept much of the intelligence regarding the investigation which led to DPR&#039;s arrest as veritable.

				WOW. Am I the only one who read motek&#039;s post? Freindly chemist was ron paul? With the info given, it makes sense.idk...<br /><br />If someone like astor was involved, using his past actions and personna to disprove this isnt necessarily sound. They wouldnt have to be an official agent. They could have been flipped at some point. If le had access to the entire system, there is a chance someone could have been caught up on something, related to teh road or not, that was used as leverage. If they couldnt get dpr, the next step would have been to bust people close to him. Techies are historically notorius for flipping. And le is notorius for not being able to do their &quot;jobs&quot; without the aid of rats. Spread the plauge...<br />Just a side thought; red and white can mean hells angels in the states. <br />If moteks post is true ( i mean that in a purely objective tone ), pauls claim to have access to the system seems to faintly correlate with the feds july takeover. could that mean anything?

				&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, if Ron Paul was friendlychemist how did he get all those addresses?&quot;<br /><br />That my friend, is the 3.6million Btc question!?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;Becoz I too was quite (very!) shocked by these allegations and must have sent Astor (and Cirrus et al at SR High Command) over 10 requests for more information, which were ignored <br />I received NO answers from ANYONE about thesE allegations of having access to SR files!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Before I got this Privnote, from Ron Paul, (AND the first thing I knew something was &#039;wrong&#039;)&nbsp; I got a pm from a vendor I trusted implicitly, who said to me the he has &quot;just been offered $5k from ANOTHER VENDOR for my address!&quot;&nbsp; and would I mind &#039;explaining WTF?&#039;&nbsp; ...... <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I pm&#039;d him back straight away saying &quot;It&#039;s RonPaul isn&#039;t it?&quot; ,&nbsp; which, quite surprised I knew, admitted that it was, indeed RonPaul ... and I explained the basics details and this vendor ended up reporting RP for this matter ... <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; For the vendor&#039;s reporting the matter, SR high Command &quot;thanked him&quot;, said they would get back to him about it, and NOTHING WAS EVER MENTIONED AGAIN .... <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And then, not long after this, this vendor had some &quot;unexpected &quot;family&quot; troubles&quot; ... which he fixed for a few weeks, and as os july has not been seen or heard of since!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FARKIN HELL!&nbsp; I must have sent at least 20 pms, to SR admin and various mods,&nbsp; until I gave up trying to get a response,&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Many were to Astor,&nbsp; but aside from his initial brushing aside, what I had said about RonPaul&#039;s threats, and&nbsp; that i&nbsp; &#039;shouldn&#039;t&nbsp; worry&#039; <br />&nbsp;and passed him off as&nbsp; &quot;just another pathetic keyboard warrior&quot; who is full of shit!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then HOW DID HE STAY A VENDOR?<br /><br />&nbsp; I mean , c;mon, seriously, the dude had been a vendor here since mid 2011, and with several &#039;other vendor accounts&#039;&nbsp; (he had contacted me through at least 3 trying to elicit information from me with &quot;free offers!&quot;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And then he&#039;s making some VERY SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE LACK OF SECURITY IN SILK&nbsp; ROADS SYSTEMS which allow him, AND MANY OTHERS, to access key data about transactions!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And it seems&#039;s that these allegations might not be that far fetched after all ... esp IF it IS TRUE, that DPR&nbsp; DID DO his &#039;work&#039; from a cyber cafe (or wireless link, depending who you prefer) using UNENCRYPTED PROCESSES and IF they caught him &quot;hot&quot; .. on line and logged in!&nbsp; depending on the access/priveledges he had as to wtf has been divulged<br /><br />&nbsp;The only thing you can be pretty sure of is data you encrypted with GPG ..... that shit should be secure&nbsp; for at least a few more years!<br />&nbsp;<br />Love ya all<br /><br />m m m motek x<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />p.s&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#039;s all some AMAZINGLY&nbsp; CLEVER game being played by DPR&nbsp; and Co,&nbsp; where there suddenly numerous &quot;DPR&#039;s&quot; are somehow (mis) identified, and in the end it&#039;s such a massive clusterfuck that the prosecution wont be able to build a solid case or find a fair jury for many reasons already about!&nbsp; &nbsp;We could be in for one hell of a show.<br /><br />Remember Anonymous released 7 PGP encrypted &#039;files&#039; to various government bodies, and also gaave then a few snippets of&nbsp; what WAS on those encrypted files, and they &#039;threatened to release the public keys for ALL the information. IF the governments didn&#039;t comply with a number of protocals, ....

				This seems like a smearcampain towards some of the most important contributers to silkroad. Astor, kmf and Pine has done a lot to teach the people of this community to protect them selfs and the communtiy. It was Pine who wrote the tutorial which taugth me pgp, and Astor wrote a lot to help me improve my configuration to make my pgp more anonymous. And kmf has been very good at pointing out attack vectors.<br /><br />The ones who engage in this smearcampain is most likely LEO or attentionseekers who wish to come with shocking news. LEO relies on there being these attentionseekers so they just have to start the rumors and the ball will start rolling. The important thing for LE is that as many people as possible do not listens to the security advices of people like astor, kmf and pine so that people will not learn pgp and how to secure them self which would lead to making LEO&#039;s jobs much easier.

				Just because no one&#039;s mentioned it and the question has come up a couple of times... The complaint suggests that friendlychemist got a list of addresses by hacking into another (largescale) vendor&#039;s computer, and not SR itself.<br /><br />I remember motek&#039;s claims at the time (I was spending way too much time on these boards for a small personal user). I didn&#039;t really believe it (and I don&#039;t think astor not believing it is any evidence at all of astor being LE). But, if ron paul really was quite close with dpr in some way, as motek claims ron paul claimed, this would explain why DPR knew some of his personal details, or at least had something to work with that allowed him to gain some of them. If such details had been fed to DPR by ron paul, then it would explain why the details for that person do not exist, since ron paul could have been building toward this scam long-term. Still, to pay friendlychemist&#039;s &#039;narcotics suppliers&#039; for the hit... Hard to believe. But it&#039;s also not clear to me why the Feds would be lying, given that they&#039;re not even charging for this AND they had ALREADY got DPR to hire a hit through THEM.<br /><br />Questions.

				Ever since this whole thing broke, I&#039;ve been somewhat in shock... as well as my opinion(s) about what things are more likely to be true and which are more likely to be false,&nbsp; [let me emphasize that they are ONLY OPINIONS formed by myself alone], have swung drastically back and forth the more I read from various SR members in the forums, as well as what is in the media (mainly the online media as I&#039;ve not seen more than a couple of brief mentions on TV of any of this).&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I have only been a member for 6 months and never as a vendor, nor have I ever had any real knowledge of anything that goes on on the vendor&#039;s side - although in reading some of the posts in this thread as well as in some others, IF what some of the vendors are now saying is true, and I take some of it into consideration - that makes some of my original opinions seem wrong.... but at the same time this whole thing just reinforces what I have believed most of my life which is to TRUST NO ONE.&nbsp; That feeling goes back as far as I can remember.&nbsp; It just boils down to the fact that each and every person on this planet has a live to take care of that is more important than any other life (with a very few possible exceptions) .. which of course would be their own.&nbsp; And as I got older and started to notice that most things - from small favors to much bigger ones, almost are never done purely to be nice, but almost always are done with the person doing the favor also standing to benefit themself from it.&nbsp; I think that that very basic concept extends to every aspect of the human condition.<br /><br />With that said, one of the earlier things I read in conjunction with this debacle, was the federal indictment which has been posted all over the internet (although it&#039;s so long that I never did reach the end of it yet), and my first impression.. (and one that I still feel is quite probable) was that the stuff in there about DPR ordering murder-for-hire was nothing more than a lie deliberately used for the purpose of furthering their propaganda to the public that drug dealing is DANGEROUS and people get killed and there is always violence involved, blah blah... even if it&#039;s conducted purely online.&nbsp; I mean, government propaganda that drugs are &quot;bad&quot; goes back at least as far as Reefer Madness, which everyone knows and gov&#039;t even admitted to long ago, was nothing but propaganda..&nbsp; still, even though people have gotten more sophisticated and the advancement of technology has obviously played a good part in this... the feds have never swayed from their relentless forcing of anti-drug propaganda upon the public... and while atm I&#039;m pretty confused about it all and who&#039;s telling the truth and who&#039;s not and who&#039;s mixing it all up and creating their own stories and/or theories..&nbsp; still, with the idea that as of now I think I still believe it to be true that DPR voluntarily decided to take things such as weapons, CP, and other things that could be used to harm others off of SR and seemed to be of the philosophy - one that I personally have always believed in..&nbsp; that people who wish to put something into their own body should be allowed to make that decision for themselves, as that choice does not intentionally or otherwise harm others - that the same person who carried that philosophy would be soliciting murder-for hire.&nbsp; That is something I still have a lot of trouble reconciling in any way.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t make sense!<br /><br />Then, among many other posts, I read the OP of this thread and immediately though that the OP was either one of two things:&nbsp; an attention seeker with a &quot;shocking&quot; theory...&nbsp; OR someone who knows (if what he/she said is true) WAY too much about the way the FBI operates.. making me think that if he/she was the latter, then that person must surely be LE.&nbsp; If there is truth to either side of my original thoughts on that post, I&#039;ve no idea.<br /><br />Then, in reading further in this thread, I ran across posts by motek (whom I&#039;ve never even heard of, know nothing about so I had nothing to go by personally to either believe or disbelieve what he/she wrote) - with that in mind, when I read about the privnote with the death threat...&nbsp; I started to wonder if there might be after all more truth in the indictment than I&#039;d first thought...&nbsp; then I came upon astor&#039;s post which I&#039;m only including a portion of it:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: astor</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217210.msg1590703#msg1590703">Quote from: motek on October 04, 2013, 11:01 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">&nbsp;

when I saw in his response that he was never an admin...&nbsp; I got to thinking that I don&#039;t recall ever having seen &quot;administrator&quot; above is name in any of his forum posts...&nbsp; which leads me to give a lot less creedence to motek&#039;s post(s)... and no less confused than I&#039;ve been these past few days.<br /><br />Anyway, I appologize for the length of this post...&nbsp; I&#039;m afraid that my final thought here will not be seen by most who got bored before they got halfway through my confused ramblings...&nbsp; but here it is anyway:<br /><br />I&#039;d wondered from the beginning why the feds immediately shut down the road (other than to confiscate all the btc on the site), but kept the forums open (as it must be obvious by now to everyone that they are now in full control of the forum), because it seemed unlikely that they would have much more to learn or gain by keeping them open than they already have or think they have.&nbsp; But in reading this thread in particular (although I&#039;ve really no idea if the same thing is occuring in other threads as well), it&#039;s becoming obvious that people are pointing fingers at each other, bringing up others who haven&#039;t even posted in here, etc..&nbsp; &nbsp;so, I think I may have possibly figured out the reason for keeping the forums open.&nbsp; People are now becoming more and more suspicous of each other, turning on each other, exposing [supposedly] private messages that had not been made available to the general forum prior to this sad occurrance, and probably would have remained private had this not happened.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking that this is exactly what the feds had hoped/expected and very possibly helped facilitate to happen.&nbsp; People turning on each other and in the process, handing over more and more info that they can sift through and possibly use to add to the already ridiculous list of charges in the indictment.&nbsp; I honestly hope that everyone who is getting caught up in placing suspicion on others without real valid proof of it, takes into consideration at least the possibility that they may be playing right into the hands of the Fed&#039;s plans... and think twice before posting things that pit members against members.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last thing (promise)... all those supposed mistakes made in the very beginning of the birth of SR were probably not made by the DPR who was arrested.&nbsp; In the interview he did with Forbes not too long ago, he admits that he was not the original founder as shown in this quote found on this page of the interview *CLEARNET WARNING*&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/meet-the-dread-pirate-roberts-the-man-behind-booming-black-market-drug-website-silk-road/2/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot; Roberts isn’t actually the site’s founder, he revealed in our interview. He credits Silk Road’s creation to another, even more secretive entrepreneur whom he declined to tell me anything about and who may have used the “Dread Pirate Roberts” nom de guerre before it was assumed by the person I interviewed. The current Roberts discovered the site shortly after its creation in early 2011. Around that time, he says, he found a security flaw in the “wallet” software that stored Silk Road’s funds. The bug could have allowed a hacker to identify the site’s hardware and steal its Bitcoins. Instead of exploiting the weakness, he helped the site’s founder fix it, gained his trust and became an active partner in the business. Eventually, the current Roberts says, he bought out Silk Road’s creator and assumed full control. “It was his idea to pass the torch, in fact,” says Roberts. “He was well compensated.”&quot;<br /><br />What I took from reading the indictment against the man known now as &quot;Ross Ulbricht&quot;, it appears as if the feds are under the impression that this is the same person who was the original founder.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe this to be true.&nbsp; In part because of the above quote from the Forbes interview, as well as I&#039;ve seen several threads pop up over the time I&#039;ve been here that have had a common theme of debating whether the current DPR is the same DPR who was the founder.&nbsp; It appeared as if most people agreed that it was NOT the same DPR...&nbsp; just wanted to mention.....<br /><br />The above entire post is just the rambling thoughts of a SR member who believed and still believes in the SR Message.. but actually knows nothing about the real events that took place in order for us to have lost this great place, or the people involved in it..&nbsp; just my few cents is all....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />~foxen<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp; Nanpa has been one of the most valuable contributers to these fora, usually stating a clear and concise opinion/pov!<br /><br />&nbsp; I wondered where they had been epecially as matters like this would have them making high quality comments, in detail and at lengthh, JUST AS the OP did,at length!<br /><br />&nbsp; I have always had a lot of respect for Nanpa and their opinions, as they were usually well&nbsp; considered and factual, and has been/was one of my favorite posters<br /><br />&nbsp; Ergo, when I saw her comments about Astor (for one, I&#039;m SURE she has other &#039;ideas&#039;) and other mods like Cirrus who simply NEVER REPLIED TO ANY PM&#039;S REGARING DEATH THREATRS FROM VENDORS!<br /><br />&nbsp; VENDORS WHO CONTINUES TO TRADE as well as maintaining a 100% rating?&nbsp; WTF? <br />&nbsp;And yes, it was Limitless who was part of this whole scam!&nbsp; &nbsp;To thid=s day, I honestly wonder &quot;how fucking stoopid&quot; can people be, to order a &#039;recipe&#039; online, and then (somehow, DDW NEVER ANSWERED &#039;how&#039; he somehow, provided, &quot;clandestine chemistry consulting&quot; ON LINE!!&nbsp; (probably Skype, with thesemental giants!)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also agree with Foxen, and this statement ....<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I&#039;d wondered from the beginning why the feds immediately shut down the road (other than to confiscate all the btc on the site), but kept the forums open (as it must be obvious by now to everyone that they are now in full control of the forum), because it seemed unlikely that they would have much more to learn or gain by keeping them open than they already have or think they have.&nbsp; But in reading this thread in particular (although I&#039;ve really no idea if the same thing is occuring in other threads as well), it&#039;s becoming obvious that people are pointing fingers at each other, bringing up others who haven&#039;t even posted in here, etc..&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;so, I think I may have possibly figured out the reason for keeping the forums open. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;People are now becoming more and more suspicous of each other, turning on each other, exposing [supposedly] private messages that had not been made available to the general forum prior to this sad occurrance, and probably would have remained private had this not happened.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m thinking that this is exactly what the feds had hoped/expected and very possibly helped facilitate to happen.&nbsp; People turning on each other and in the process, handing over more and more info that they can sift through and possibly use to add to the already ridiculous list of charges in the indictment. <br />&nbsp; I honestly hope that everyone who is getting caught up in placing suspicion on others without real valid proof of it, takes into consideration at least the possibility that they may be playing right into the hands of the Fed&#039;s plans... and think twice before posting things that pit members against members&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; AND THE &quot;WHO WAS/IS THE &#039;NEW&#039;&nbsp; DPR???<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot; Roberts isn’t actually the site’s founder, he revealed in our interview. He credits Silk Road’s creation to another, even more secretive entrepreneur whom he declined to tell me anything about and who may have used the “Dread Pirate Roberts” nom de guerre before it was assumed by the person I interviewed. The current Roberts discovered the site shortly after its creation in early 2011. Around that time, he says, he found a security flaw in the “wallet” software that stored Silk Road’s funds. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The bug could have allowed a hacker to identify the site’s hardware and steal its Bitcoins. Instead of exploiting the weakness, he helped the site’s founder fix it, gained his trust and became an active partner in the business. Eventually, the current Roberts says, he bought out Silk Road’s creator and assumed full control. <br /><br />&nbsp; “It was his idea to pass the torch, in fact,” says Roberts. “He was well compensated.”&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; What I took from reading the indictment against the man known now as &quot;Ross Ulbricht&quot;, it appears as if the feds are under the impression that this is the same person who was the original founder.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t believe this to be true.&nbsp; In part because of the above quote from the Forbes interview, as well as I&#039;ve seen several threads pop up over the time I&#039;ve been here that have had a common theme of debating whether the current DPR is the same DPR who was the founder.&nbsp; It appeared as if most people agreed that it was NOT the same DPR... <br /><br />As have we too ..... this whole thing is BEYOND fiction!

Based on a forensic analysis of the SR server, the server included code restricted access to a specific IP address. That IP was through a VPN server. The provider&#039;s records were subpoenaed. Most of the information on the account was deleted by the user, but the information on the last log in was preserved. The IP used to log into the VPN was 500 feet from the friend&#039;s house where he was logging into his Gmail account (the one he used to live with). They also discovered that by 7/23 (date they imaged SR server) that the IP address had been commented out of the SR code. Reviewing is SR PMs, they found a message form 5/23 form another user indicating that some sort of external IP was leaking from SR. It listed the VPN IP that had been used up to that point, leading Ulbricht to deactivate the code regarding the VPN IP and to change the way he accessed the server.<br /><br />and someone came into the forums around that time saying it.

				It could be that the feds got Astor, and used him to catch DPR. Like offered him a deal or used his account. This would make sense cuz DPR wouldn&#039;t make a deal with someone he didn&#039;t trust.

But it doesn&#039;t make much sense. From the post of astor there aren&#039;t anything which suggest that he has done anything illegal. So if the FBI did find out who he was they probably wouldn&#039;t have anything on him to force him to cooperate with him. And astor is most likely just a member of this forum, which is much harder to find than a person who is responsible for the forum and its servers. He is also evidently very conserned with security so he would be a hard fish to catch. <br /><br />It would be much easier for them to just get DPR instead of getting astor so he could &quot;make a deal with DPR&quot;.
