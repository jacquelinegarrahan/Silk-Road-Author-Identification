				Hey everyone!<br /><br />Been a while since I&#039;ve last posted. I wanted to share a small story to further confirm why SR is amazing. I realize I&#039;m preaching to the choir, but hey, I think it&#039;s good to share anyway. :)<br /><br />I initially had an interest to join SR for me and my curiosity. The idea that this place could be a safe way to explore curiosities blew me away!&nbsp; And so I did just that. And things were good. That&#039;s about the time I met someone else. This person and I have actually developed quite a relationship so far. I&#039;m definitely excited to see where that goes. <br /><br />She does, however, suffer from chronic back pain. With the economy the way it is she hasn&#039;t been able to find employment, and therefore no health insurance is available to her. So how could she get the meds she requires so she doesn&#039;t live in pain? Hmm, I know! ;) I got her covered, thanks to this community.<br /><br />In conclusion: I think the only thing better than buying from SR to experiment, is buying from SR to help someone that truly needs it. Take care guys. Happy holidays!<br />

				Wow, what a touching story. It is amazing that what is deemed taboo is actually beneficial to people. Stick with each other and be extremely supportive since you have an understanding of the pain she goes through. I wish you two luck +1
