				I think a temporary fix could be recreating all your listings from scratch with no image (I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s possible, I don&#039;t have a vendor account).<br />Just an idea though...

				I&#039;m leaving my listings up but I&#039;m taking all my not in escrow BTC off the site. Looks like the db is getting mucked about with, probably a sql injection as others pointed out.<br /><br />Clever idea really, this scam. Presumably the hot wallet is secured elsewhere. So how do you turn access to the product listing tables into a scam? Kudos, scammers.

Carefully. I had that shipping &quot;bug&quot; the other day too. I think that was just a dry run by the people carrying out this attack. <br /><br />To everyone else, this is not about having coins or moving coins. Just because the image &quot;server&quot; is vulnerable does not mean that SRs methods of storing coins is (although they could be), just cant assume one is connected to the other.<br /><br />I very modestly have a few listings that are in the top pf certain categorys. It seems it is these listings that get both the image changed and has hipping options dropped.<br /><br />I was out for a bit. Has any progress been made about this issue? Any &quot;official&quot; message from DPR or the likes?<br /><br />

				Thanks Shroomeister, <br /><br />We had this same problem with our shipping options. Reloading the defaults actually worked but I guess we&#039;ll have to check our listing around. The Quick Buy thing is more of a concern imo...even though we&#039;ve not been attacked yet this is nerve racking. Let&#039;s wait for an actual update from DPR, we need one.

				It would appear that if they are able to target specific listings then they are targeting the default highest ranked ones.<br /><br /><br />Not about being broke or new ;)<br /><br />...well maybe new, because then your item wouldnt be at the top of &quot;best selling&quot; yet...<br /><br />Im redoing all my images and shipping options again.
