			<dd class="postbody">
				Well this is probably going to be a bit of a rant actually, but I think its to just blow off some steam from the past week and feedbacks I received. I would like to think I would go that little bit extra to keep people happy, but I know that there are some people I am just not going to please.<br /><br />But I think the one that really tipped me over the edge was an order that was placed basically a month ago. Now I normally send out the orders and wait ten days before I send a check up message to see if there is a problem and get it nipped in the butt. I send that messasge off and 18 days later he shows up to say he hasn&#039;t received the order. Mind you the order has already auto finalised and everything.<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t run an FE policy and I let things stay in escrow for a reason. If there is a problem it can get sorted within that time and a bit further if needed, but I would want the problem raised&nbsp; within that time. This guy just let it go and I can only assume he got his order and there was no problem. But they still can leave 1/5 feedback saying they never got it, even though I feel like I did everything as a vendor I could. He even paid extra on the international shipping (technically was two orders but i shipped it in one package) and even past this I still honoured the message I sent saying I would refund half the P&amp;P back and have done so.<br /><br />Just feeling a little sad I guess.<br /><br />-Amush

I think he should be given the opportunity to read the mail I last sent him detailing the situation as from my point of view. I am mad about it and if he cannot see the problem of just letting something auto finalise, not replying to follow ups and then marking bad feedback because he didn&#039;t receive an item; to which he never raised the issue with when it was in escrow, I would like to ask the link to the blacklist so that I can warn other vendors.

				I just got burned in the same way when I tried to be a GREAT vendor with a free re-ship and free seeds in BOTH orders.<br /><br />What is really crappy is I used Delivery Confirmation Notices and both of them show delivered.<br /><br />The guy stated &quot;Sorry, I&#039;ve been on vacation, I never received anything&quot;, waiting until almost an entire month before posting his feedback, after his coins have already finalized.<br /><br />It seems like this is the new buyer scam.<br /><br />In my case, SR Admin is sitting on it because they don&#039;t know which side to believe even tho I&#039;ve produced two DCNs that show delivered.<br /><br />Oh, the buyer in my case used two different addresses in two different states. I didn&#039;t catch it because of how I clean my records out. I will be working out a new system to help with this abuse on my end. I wish SR could do something but it&#039;s a weak point in the system.<br /><br />I had perfect feedback until this guy ruined it.

And how am I supposed to know this? I mean that is why I sent up a follow up. Cause I have no clue. He never informed me he would be away. I mean if he did I would have made for allowance for the fact he may not have been there for the order to arrive to pick up that there was a problem with the order. Delay it so I would send it off for when he would actually be there. I just can&#039;t do that after the fact. I mean I can totally believe he was on holiday, but that means anything could have happened to the mail.<br /><br />And I am a bit annoyed that he did give me 1/5 without really contacting me first. Especially doing all I could for him on my end. I couldn&#039;t have done anymore really.<br /><br />-Amush

				I just wanted to say to those vendor&#039;s posting here on this thread how impressed I am with the way you guy&#039;s operate and care about your businesses and it&#039;s reputation.

				<br />This is definitely one of the most difficult ways to retail products that I&#039;ve ever tried. Reputation is so important here. It&#039;s such a stark contrast from the normal business world. Now both customers and vendors are on the bleeding edge with each other for control over the marketplace.<br /><br />Very interesting times, indeed, but this is difficult. :-)<br /><br />HMS<br />

				I know why people sell coke and E and its hard to get a pure products.<br /><br />But for weed, I would not bother. I don&#039;t mind buying in bitcoins and used them for over a year but being a vendor you pay here and pay fees just to get the botcoins back into money! Even that must be hard to do.<br /><br />I would buy coke here and E and only cannabis oil as you never see that being sold.<br /><br />Also, I was a buyer here who spent hundreds of bitcoins, always released the payment when I got the orders. Allways marked 5/5 if it was or messaged the vendor as sometimes they make mistakes and twice this did happen. If I marked the vendor 1/5 it would be mean unless I got in touch. I ordered 60 items, but my stats got ruined with just a few grams of very pricey oil. Also got robbed of 10 grams of charly off a vendor {and we all did!! ]&nbsp; <br />So vendors who scam should be reported. But when they just vanish we have to just take the loss because at least nobody is going to be stabbing you or whatever because buying in the street or even the houses is dangerous this days and age.<br /><br />I love SR but was pissedd off when I lost out a lot of money. I also was stupid for FE when my stats were good!!!<br /><br />Now, I got 0% and can be scammed easily as I got to FE.<br /><br />I will not be stupid and buy lots of something/<br /><br />Andeverything i sent for her did come!!<br /><br />

				Sounds like you need a secretary!<br /><br />I do sympahise though and maybe you should use mail tracking or registered/recorded delivery. For bigger orders I would do this without thinking as my work would often be running the entire office whilst some man with his head up his arse just had an idea! Secretaries&nbsp; make the business not the managers, CEO or the board. <br /><br />Nobody is&nbsp; perfect though and I lost my pin again/!!!<br /><br />And my glasses!<br /><br />So excuse any spelling mistakes.<br /><br />&nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br />But my pin is being reset. (again!) <br /><br />I know now what a phisher is! ?So SR have to make sure that people cannot steal the bitcoins you have.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />So mine are safe from the phishers who I imagine guess your password but then cannot actually take any bitcoins because they might not guess the pin.<br /><br />I have found a website for generating complex passwords. Trouble is you cannot remember these and so this encryption might make sense so I can keep this password extra safe and not just on a usb keyring!.<br /><br />Because I have bought anything yet I have not sent any address out so will use encryptrion and test it on someone when I buy because I have no idea yet if my &#039;key&#039; will actually work!<br /><br />Thanks SR!<br /><br />And if anyone needs a secretary, a good secretary, let me know!<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

You have a wrong concept about encryption:<br /><br />- To send an encrypted message to somebody you don&#039;t need your key but that somebody&#039;s. <br /><br />- To have somebody send you an encrypted message you give that person your (public) key, which they use to encrypt a message to you.

				One thing that sucks about the internet is you arnt able to judge people. You cant tell what kinda car they drive or the clothes they wear. I have never had a problem in real life when im dealing with a successful individual. I can tell these people they have all new everything, diamonds in thier watches, gold around thier neck. These people know how to make money. But then there is the constant problems generated by broke mother fuckers. The punks that look like a rich broke mother fucker. They got a fake watch, thier gold chain is turning silver in some places, got 24s on an 84 lac. Sounds to me like you were dealing with a poor person. And poor people dont know how to get money, thats why hes focused on 6 grams.
