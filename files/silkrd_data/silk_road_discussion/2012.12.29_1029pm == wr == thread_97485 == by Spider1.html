				To be a bulk domestic dealer, you need to get even more bulk internationally, increasing the risk.<br /><br />So you want someone else to take that risk for you so you can get the low-risk domestic bulk.<br /><br />Tell you what, why don&#039;t you become a bulk domestic dealer?

				I honestly wish i could supply to vendors on here because i can get heroin so much cheap and i could make a profit and vendors could still mark it up. I just don&#039;t wanna have to go through the hassle of fucking having to fill orders and float all my coins in escrow. <br /><br />I also have a big problem with the exchanges.<br /><br />I wish there was a wholesale escrow system for bitcoins that we could use without having to become a vendor. We just send the sample, and then escrow and send larger and larger amts.<br /><br />Like people who supply upcoming vendors, that is who i would want to be.

				Yeah but it is to much of a hassle and dude i have no fucking clue how to use mtgox lool.<br /><br />I have my own method for obtaining and cashing out bitcoins, but it wouldn&#039;t work with fucking hundreds of BTC.<br /><br />I would use the Escrow if they had a supplier system in which the wholesale suppliers didn&#039;t get penalyzed or taxed much.<br /><br />I am tempted to start sending out samples to people. <br /><br />And i might start a third party business to use Liberty Reserve (i&#039;ll hide behind VPN, multiple proxies and accs) and ship large amounts of H. But idk cause fucking bitcoins are so annoying to deal with,
