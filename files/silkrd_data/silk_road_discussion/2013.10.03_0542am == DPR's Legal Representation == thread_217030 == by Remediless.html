				Right so I know none of us know WTF is actually going on but apparently this Ross kid appeared in court in San Fran briefly yesterday saying he can&#039;t afford a lawyer and was assigned a court-appointed lawyer.<br /><br />Can we put our heads together and think of any contacts we may have personally we can reach out to or anyone - specifically lawyers who have an interest in human rights, libertarianism etc might represent him for the publicity pro bono? <br /><br />I&#039;m happy to get in touch with them myself today and point them at the case in case they aren&#039;t aware of it but I need help thinking up potential names......... (and you&#039;re all cleverer than me, ahem, well mostly).<br /><br />Also would Libertarians like the paypal mafia guy who bankrolled Ron Paul&#039;s presidential bid (I&#039;m going thru a slight opiate withdrawal so bear with my clangy train of thought) be able to contribute to his defense fund? I know he&#039;s in deeeeeeeeeeep shit and the FUCKING FEDS (FUCK YOU GUYS, BTW if you&#039;re reading) are gonna make an example of this poor guy but I&#039;m a big believer in doing SOMETHING instead of sobbing hot salty tears over SR&#039;s end. <br /><br />Reme xxx<br /><br /><br />

				Oh course he has money.<br />I&#039;m sure he worked out how to withdraw at least enough to pay for a lawyer.<br /><br />I&#039;m not 100% sold on the info we&#039;ve been given either.<br />It doesn&#039;t all add up.

This is insane, especially when you consider these prisoners are then pimped out as cheap labour to local counties.&nbsp; In my opinion it&#039;s the new face of slavery.&nbsp; The US system is fucked.

				It&#039;s VERY conceivable he has no money.<br />All he had is now considered a proceed of crime, and he would not be able to use any of it to pay a lawyer.<br />There is no lawyer that will take a case where &quot;if he wins he might get paid&quot; from a pool of seized assets.<br />I&#039;d say he&#039;s going to have to go public defender or someone will have to start a legal kickstarter... it won&#039;t be a cheap case.

				Just a quick update in case you haven&#039;t seen it :-<br /><br /><br />Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund, created by a semi-famous anarchist Mike Gogulski (nostate.com , bradleymanning.org):<br /><br />CLEARNET: <br /><br />http://www.rossulbricht.org/<br /><br />*********COPY AND PASTE FROM THAT SITE FOLLOWS..............***<br /><br />Introducing the Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund<br /><br />Hi, I’m Mike Gogulski, and I operate rossulbricht.org.<br /><br />On 2 October 2013, the US government announced that it seized the Silk Road website and assets and arrested its alleged operator, Dread Pirate Roberts, now known by his alleged real name, Ross William Ulbricht.<br /><br />I registered the following domains within hours of the announcement: rossulbricht.org, rossulbricht.com, rossulbricht.net, freerossulbricht.org, freerossulbricht.com and freerossulbricht.net. All of the other domains redirect here, to rossulbricht.org.<br /><br />This site is dedicated to providing support and legal defense funding to Ross. He is charged with a variety of offenses, and given the extremely punitive nature of the US “justice” system, he faces many, many years in prison if convicted. Raising funds for his legal defense is important, since the more legal resources one has, the better the chances of acquittal or reduced sentencing.<br /><br />This website is also for YOU, Ross Ulbricht’s supporters — well, and detractors. My policy right now, before launch, is to not censor or delete any negative comments about the man, about me, or about this legal defense fundraising&nbsp; and support effort. Don’t feed the trolls; eventually, they get bored and move on.<br /><br />Who am I? Just a guy. My business website is at gogulski.com and I blog at nostate.com. Some will be interested to know that I was also the original registrant of bradleymanning.org, and thereby co-founder of what became the Bradley Manning Support Network. That organization is now called the Private Manning Support Network, as Manning announced upon sentencing at court-martial that she now identifies as a woman and that she has chosen the name Chelsea to replace Bradley.<br /><br />More to come. Meanwhile, read the FAQ, and start a conversation.<br /><br />Peace,<br />Mike Gogulski <br /><br /><br />________________________________________<br /><br /><br />Ross Ulbricht’s parents say zero chance of murder-for-hire<br /><br />The parents of Ross Ulbricht — who is accused of being Dread Pirate Roberts, operator of the Silk Road marketplace — say that there is no chance he ever ordered a murder-for-hire and that they have legally-admissible evidence to prove it.<br /><br />I spoke for about two hours today with Lyn and Kirk Ulbricht at their home (by telephone –ed.). We discussed a variety of matters including legal, public relations and fundraising strategies.

Dread Pirate Roberts did less bad things than Heisenberg.<br /><br />Seeing that extrajudicial assassinations (often killing civillians as collateral damage) by the US government don&#039;t cause an outrage in America I don&#039;t see why this should lessen sympathies for Dread Pirate Roberts.<br />The US government is like &quot;Look! We don&#039;t take our laws seriously. And we shit on the human rights of every human outside America and constantly try to hack friendly countries. Crime and unlawful actions are necessary under certain circumstances.&quot;<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts couldn&#039;t commit as many crimes in 10 years as the US government does in a few months.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sentiment seems to be mixed here. Most admire what he created and his stance on the war on drugs (usually prefaced with something like &quot;I don&#039;t condone breaking the law BUT ...&quot;. The whole murder-for-hire thing isn&#039;t sitting well with a lot of folks. I&#039;m not sure that I&#039;d classify that as a character assassination; he was indicted for it. <br /><br />On the other hand, the story about hiring redandwhite to kill FriendlyChemist does not belong in the complaint and should be in the news. He wasn&#039;t charged in that and they have zero proof. I know they have no proof, because you get charged for hiring an assassin whether they are successful or not (like as in the MD case). And they are painting him like some kind of violent gangster (average Americans are pretty afraid of anarchy, so it&#039;s not tough to play on that fear).<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s not really a liberal vs conservative ideology thing here. Many conservatives are pro-legalization of drugs and libertarians can pretty much be divided into those who lean liberal or conservative.

				I&#039;m still unclear about something that perhaps someone would clear up.<br />Just WHY did SR get shut down when DPR got arrested. They couldn&#039;t shut it down before and what should be different unless DPR told them HOW to shut it down. If they had the ability to do this what difference does arresting the Admin. make?<br />So did DPR direct them to shut it and if they could do it without his help then why did they wait untill now?

				@Incubusdriver: Hey! I saw your message before and will be in touch!<br /><br />If anyone&#039;s interested (because I know all sorts of people read these forums, not just SR vendors and buyers who obviously wish to stay anonymous), then I saw on reddit that Ross Ulbricht&#039;s mom and dad are currently running his email address and wants people to help with his defense fund.<br /><br />*******COPY AND PASTE****<br /><br />They can send an email to the now public rossulbricht@gmail.com, his mom and dad are using it to solicit phone numbers of people who are willing to help post bail. If you email her with your real name and phone number, she will give it to the court officer in New York. She needs it before Monday but Ross’s defense lawyer says that the more support he gets in the form of secured bail before his hearing on Tuesday the better for his trial starting off on the right foot.<br /><br />********<br /><br />If you&#039;re concerned about doing that but serious about fronting money to help then you could always contact his attorney Brandon LeBlanc direct.&nbsp; Office: 415-436-7700<br /><br /><br />Whatever the info might be that we&#039;ve heard in the past week... I personally still believe in the idea of being innocent until proven guilty ...

He&#039;s not going to be granted bail anyway, but he&#039;s still in custody because of the actions of his own attorney. <br /><br />He&#039;s a major flight risk and he&#039;s charged with some very serious felony offenses; he will remain in custody until: A) he has a trial and is found not guilty, which is a matter of years in federal district court, and if found guilty, several more years for the appeal process -or- B) he agrees to a plea bargain and serves his time.

It DOES NOT mean that it proves anything. You can introduce as many holes as you like, but the jury has to think that a reasonable person would consider them possible (introducing holes is what defense attorneys are paid to do, but I don&#039;t know of any with a 100% success rate). If they don&#039;t by the theory, then it doesn&#039;t matter. Unfortunately, the term &#039;reasonable doubt&#039; is subjective (i.e. in the eye of the beholder). The judge will instruct the jury (this is all hypothetical because 95% US criminal cases never go to trial) that &#039;reasonable doubt&#039; is what an ordinary person of average intelligence would believe to be true (or doubtful). Unfortunately, this interpretation is based on each juror&#039;s personal experiences, which is why both sides will try to pack the jury with people who they think would be sympathetic to their argument. Usually people whose views are transparent are eliminated from the jury pool (each side gets a limited number of objections).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217030.msg1590573#msg1590573">Quote from: Cornelius23 on October 04, 2013, 09:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t know what evidence his parents may have but it might, for one example, be that he was incapacitated or otherwise unable to use a computer on some of the dates in question.

He should have refused to say anything at all to them since they didn&#039;t have either a search or an arrest warrant. That was two months before his arrest. <br /><br />How does one prove that a person wasn&#039;t able to &quot;use a computer?&quot; Even if I were hospitalized, I still could connect to the internet with an iPhone. And if it were an Android phone, I could use Orbot to connect to the TOR network.<br /><br />The best shot they have is to prove that Ulbricht wasn&#039;t ANY of the supposed DPRs and that there was no such person. But if they can&#039;t show that he was in no way associated with that character whatsoever, then he&#039;s still subject to being found guilty on conspiracy charges.<br /><br />Sure, evidence is evidence, but that doesn&#039;t mean that the jury will interpret it in the same way that you or I would. And they will definitely weigh the fact that it was produced by his parents. Most people would do anything to protect their children, and if they didn&#039;t know he was guilty, they wouldn&#039;t be guilty of perjury. The jury would be aware of that.

He could be Santa Claus and still be one of the &quot;others&quot; referred to in the complaint.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />He may be named but it would still need to be proved that he conspired with the persons planning to commit the crimes. Simply knowing a person does not indicate that one knows everything that they&#039;re up to. We know each other and we know that we are both criminals but if I turn out to be planning to assassinate the queen you are not therefore guilty of conspiring with me to do so :)<br /><br />There seems to be no evidence beyond hearsay to support the &#039;hit man&#039; allegations in the NY case (hence his not being charged for such) nor, I as see, any strong indication that he had any connection to DPR prior to around July other than being a friend who promoted SR. The Maryland indictment depends entirely on the assumption that DPR and Mr Ulbricht were the same person much earlier in the year but seems to offer nothing to support the assertion. While I cannot account for whatever tricks may be employed to sway juries I feel that these facts could be vital to Mr Ulbricht&#039;s defence against the Maryland charges. The NY ones, of course, (not including anything murder-related) are somewhat trickier.

				The first person he is accused of wanting to be murdered was never killed, and I wonder if DPR, whoever he was at that time, was aware that he wouldn&#039;t be[*].

The vendor was Nob. The hitman was a UC agent (aka Nob). Chronic Pain was the former SR employee that DPR wanted killed.<br /><br />The Maryland indictment is going to hard to beat. They were very clever (well, for the FBI at least). According to the indictment, an undercover agent (we know it&#039;s Nob) got DPR to facilitate a deal with a vendor for a kilo of coke (which we know to be googleyed1 and Chronic Pain). Nob gave DPR a song and dance about being so big that it wasn&#039;t worth it for him to sell less than 10 kilos (although oddly the deal was only for 1 kg). DPR thinks he&#039;s going to make a killing on the commission. Chronic Pain got arrested. He started threatening DPR. And of all people DPR turned to Nob to kill him. Not good.<br /><br />That&#039;s all laid out in the indictment. I say we know that googleyed1 and Chronic Pain were the vendors, and that Nob was the agent, because the events on pages 3-4 watch exactly what googleyed1 says in this thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=218042.15<br /><br />The first 6 pages are a good read:<br />https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/801207-gov-uscourts-mdd-238311-4-0.html<br /><br />My guess would be that Chronic Pain is testifying against him. It will be tough with both the agent and his testimony. This is the stronger of the 2 cases. They just have to show they know Nob was talking to Ulbricht.
