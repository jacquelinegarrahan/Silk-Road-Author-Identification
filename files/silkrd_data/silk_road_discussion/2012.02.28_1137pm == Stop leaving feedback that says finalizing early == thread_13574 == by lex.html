				There is NO POINT in leaving stupid feedback &quot;Finalizing early!&quot; &quot;Finalizing early for this TRUSTED SELLER&quot;. What are you people completely retarded? Once you click &quot;finalize&quot;, the coins are released, that&#039;s it. DON&#039;T LEAVE FEEDBACK UNTIL YOU GET YOUR PRODUCT. Jesus fucking Christ what is wrong with these people?

				But &quot;finalizing early for a trusted seller&quot; doesn&#039;t tell you anything since many people do it &quot;out of respect.&quot; And they do it for vendors who don&#039;t require early finalization. I see it all the time and usually am puzzled as to why they do it. Reading forums I found that they do it as a favor to the vendor or out of respect for the vendor. But this is a risky business and anything can happen to the vendor at anytime. <br /><br />Not only that, but scammers love to get that sort of feedback. <br /><br />Anyway, to each his own. But useful feedback will disclose how long shipping took, past experience, professional packaging, etc. Details that inspire confidence in the vendor.

				If you would take a second to breath instead of typing frantically, you&#039;d realize there is a very useful point in noting you are finalizing early.&nbsp; It is the only way currently to distinguish a fully satisfied 5/5 for a product delivered as promised from a 5/5 for an order that hasn&#039;t arrived yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically, you can choose from either leaving less than 5/5 when finalizing early until the package arrives, leaving no feedback notes, or essentially equating your incomplete order with 5/5 completed orders by not noting you had finalized early and are awaiting a package.<br /><br />Do you believe that a transaction that has been filled to the customer&#039;s satisfaction is the same as a transaction that has been paid for yet not filled?&nbsp; If not, then why would you expect the feedback to be the same?&nbsp; Different scenarios require different feedback.&nbsp; The scenario of finalizing early is a perfect use for...you guessed it....a feedback of &quot;Finalized Early.&quot;<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Editing to add a reply to BenJesuit.&nbsp; The act of finalizing early for a trusted and beloved vendor is a way to show your appreciation for solid customer service by freeing money from escrow so it is more immediately useful to their ongoing operations.&nbsp; It is also beneficial for the buyer if they have full faith in the vendor, because with more capital at any given moment the vendor has more flexibility in what and how much they stock.&nbsp; I personally avoid most early finalization, but will not hesitate to finalize early for a trusted smaller seller I feel may benefit from the immediate funds.

				@sonic<br /><br />I see where you&#039;re getting at. After all, that have to leave something. And sure they can update later. <br /><br />I guess, DPR will have to eventually crack down on the process of finalizing early by locking out buyers with more than a certain number of transactions and with a certain amount spent from the ability to finalize early. <br /><br />So many people get scammed or have to go through unnecessary stress because of finalizing early. I mean, sure, if you leave it in escrow and have to wait for a resolution, you can lose money due to a drop in BTC value during that time. But it sure beats losing the entire amount due to a scam or some other unforeseen event that occurred with the vendor<br />

You can finalize an order without assigning a number or adding a comment (or can finalize and then wait a few days before posting any kind of feedback).<br /><br />My sense is that some inexperienced/insecure buyers see finalizing early (and letting the world know that they&#039;ve finalized early) as &quot;the *right* thing to do if a seller is a good/legit one.&nbsp; I think that seeing so many buyers note &quot;I&#039;m finalizing early&quot; causes new folks to think it is some kind of SR tradition that makes one an insider or a full fledged member here, thus they follow suit.

				Point taken. Since I never did it, I wasn&#039;t completely positive in the mechanics. It just seemed like leaving it blank wouldn&#039;t mesh with the psyche of most people. So they&#039;d feel obligated to say something.<br /><br />But I think you&#039;re right about the new buyers thinking it&#039;s an SR etiquette or tradition. <br /><br />A lot of them don&#039;t come to the forum to read about the sad tales of those who finalized early. If they did, they think twice about it. That is unless they meet up with a vendor that requires FE for new enlistees.

				How about leaving 1/5 if you are first to finalize early until you receive the item? When you see <br /><br />ranked #3 out of 324 sellers with 99.9% positive feedback from more than 500 transactions<br /><br />You think he&#039;s the most legit seller on the website, but only realizing later that most of that feedback is &#039;Finalizing early&#039;.&nbsp; It&#039;s not as bad as the lotteries though.

				I don&#039;t think anyone would have the balls to leave 1/5 when FE. Fear that the vendor might retaliate somehow. Considering a vendor did have a meltdown with a 1/5 with FE (though it was a buyer scam), it stands to reason that most vendors wouldn&#039;t be happy about it. <br />&nbsp;

				It&#039;s hardly a chore to read through a few pages of feedback before ordering is it? You&#039;re about to spend $100+ on something, you check it out before right? If it all says finalizing early then leave that seller and come back when some people have updated the feedback. A lot of the buyers on SR seem to be obsessed with &quot;I want it NOW&quot; - if you&#039;re in such a rush for your product then go down your local dealers house and get it. This is my opinion anyways and it&#039;s been this way (in the short time I&#039;ve been on SR) due to some really bad behavior towards a quality seller I&#039;ve, getting shit from people for no other reason other than their own impatience.

				God yes!! I totally agree with the OP and I&#039;ve said it before in other threads. Why on earth would you finalize early and then leave feedback??<br /><br />If you HAVE to finalize early for some reason then at least wait until you receive the actual product before leaving feedback. I&#039;ve lost count of how many vendors have over-inflated ratings because everyone leaves a 5/5 because they have &#039;respect&#039; for the vendor whether they have ordered from them before or not. This doesn&#039;t help at all. How can you give 5/5 if you haven&#039;t even received and tried the product??<br /><br />It really does screw with the whole point of feedback and this trend of leaving 5/5 even when you haven&#039;t received what you ordered is madness. It almost feels like people leave a 5/5 because they think this will keep the vendor happy. The whole point of feedback is to evaluate the whole process - from ordering to receiving to consuming.<br /><br />This issue is close to my heart at the moment because I am one of many who have taken the rating of a vendor to be a fair and just assessment of their reliability and in return have been burnt.<br /><br />Please, if you have to finalize early, at least wait until you receive your product before leaving feedback.

				As a new buyer with low stats, most vendors request early finalisation.<br /><br />I had no idea you could FE and leave the feedback BLANK until I read this thread.<br /><br />Will keep this in mind for future purchases.

				I am new here and already received one order and waiting for a new one. When I did it for a first time, vendor did not forced me to finalize early and I finalized right after receiving envelope. Also, before the first buy I spent some time for investigation on shipping, security, etc. And on stage of choosing vendor, I already knew about escrow, finalization, also i read vendor&#039;s history, searching real delivery reviews among the fe-reviews. Don&#039;t assume that SR newcomers are stupid, everyone can easily find all important information about buying stuff here. And if somebody are so lazy and stupid, you somehow should forbid them to buy here, because they can ignore all personal security measures and got busted lol&nbsp; ;D

				No truer words. No truer words, davidd. <br /><br />so true, can&#039;t control the actions of others. If people want to finalize before getting their order, that&#039;s their business. If someone gets burnt because of it, well, means they dont spend any time reading the forum. Ive been lurkin and readin b4 my first order. this whole thing seemed to good to be true so i figured better see what the catch is. everywhere I read, somebody would say, &quot;do not finalize early.&quot; <br /><br />so i thought vendors who required it were scammers. I looked for ones who didn&#039;t. not even for noobs. And i thought finalize early might be like some thing to do to maybe get you some extra. But I am not looking to get burned so i figured i&#039;d be different than everyone else and use the escrow system for what it was designed for.&nbsp; <br /><br />if i had to guess, i say that maybe only 33% of people use the escrow system how it was designed. could be more like maybe up to 50% on a good day.

				It strikes me that you&#039;re looking deeper than you need to.&nbsp; The finalizing early thing is a great show of trust/respect between a buyer and seller.&nbsp; They have used them before and have no doubts their order will be received and for that are rewarding the vendor with quicker access to their funds.&nbsp; If it&#039;s a vendor asking a buyer to FE, well then they should state that.&nbsp; I know as a vendor when I see the new buyer I prefer to make their experience the best ever rather than treat them as a crook right off the bat.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been burned by this but I accept that as the risk.&nbsp; I&#039;ll take the risk to get someone comfortable with the market and the good vendors rather than treat them like a crook on their first purchase at an emerging market.<br /><br />As far as all the other feedback tweaks...only one I&#039;m looking for is not being able to change it down the line.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a lot of vendors posting complaints about someone showing up from a purchase earlier and holding their feedback ransom...what the shit.

				excuse me if maybe I am too malicious but if you are going to scam &quot;finalized early&quot; or similar declinations of the same phrase are the most simple comment you can leave if you use self-fabricated accounts.<br />In facts, building up a consistent number of positive and most of all credible comments to overshadow negative feedbacks and mantain a &gt;95/100 reputation requires time ( a couple of days for sure because 20 feedbacks in 2 hour is definitely NOT credible ) and a lot of fantasy.<br />However I think that reviews on forum are much more important than feedbacks, in particular I trust in sellers who got a detailed review every 20 feedbacks at least because I think that subtracting the repetitive buyers at least 50% of all orders are made by noob, so I cannot believe that at least 1 of 10 of these noobs doesn&#039;t come to the forum and enjoy their experience.<br />&nbsp;

There is obviously always an element of risk involved in doing business like this for both parties.<br /><br />My comments were more directed at other people/posts in this thread who were painting this picture that people tend to only FE early because they have some sort of profound trust in the vendor and are regular customers that have purchased repeatedly from them.<br /><br />Just wanted to remind people that the majority if FE cases are actually due to the fact that new buyers typically have to establish themselves as trustworthy and build up a reputation, and are left without many choices but to FE. If you trawl through pages of feedback, you usually see comments that say something like &quot;Finalising early, new buyer.&quot; Admittedly, sometimes the comments do say things like &quot;Finalising early, trustworthy seller,&quot; but I think the majority of them are new buyers.<br /><br />After considering all of this, I guess I don&#039;t really see FE as so much of a problem, as long as more people make a habit of going back and updating/changing their feedback and comments once the item is received and tested, as well as writing reviews of vendors and products in the forums, so we can all get a better idea of who to do business with.

				I think it looks bad also but I feel if they do finalize early the buyer should also update once it&#039;s received. I think that&#039;s just the buyer being honest but also looks bad for the vendor so I feel anyone who says finalized early should also update that once they receive.

				like the above post says. It is completely optional to leave feedback when finalizing. You can finalize one day, and wait a frickin week to give feedback (AFAIK.. I&#039;ve only ever waited about 3 or 4 days). I usually finalize immediately (OK, not immediately, as that would be impossible, but as soon as reasonably possible) upon receiving a package, then finalize once I&#039;ve had a chance to assess its quality, quantity, packaging, etc. In the couple situations where I&#039;ve finalized before shipping (which I&#039;ve only done twice) I reserved the review until I was satisfied enough to give a 5/5. I did this even when one order came up short (finalized, but did not review yet).. That ended up very well, because the vendor (Davidd) gave me what I was owed, plus extra (which must have surely cost him out of pocket, and for shipping).. He got a very good review from me in the end... That&#039;s not even finalizing early..<br /><br />Still, it always left me confused looking at all the &#039;Finalizing early&#039; feedback. Its optional! :D

				I haven&#039;t read this whole thread but this kind of puzzled me also....because I always see reviews saying.... &quot;finalized early for trusted seller. Will update when i receive product&quot; ,....but there are never updates and it looks like all these buyers were ripped off or never got product.<br /><br />Why not just wait to receive it (or not receive it) and THEN write that u finalized early and received product as promised or whatever? Then we&#039;ll all know u got it and weren&#039;t scammed. <br />I had to FE once but didn&#039;t leave feedback until I got package...and I like that NOT REVIEWING AFTER FE&nbsp; leaves the feedback box on my orders page to basically remind me to review the item and then I can write the FULL experience at once.<br /><br />Once people review to say they FE, they never seem to remember to come back &amp; finish the story &amp; let us (potential buyers) know if they ever got it. Instead it looks like they gave their money away, never got package and just cut their loses and never came back to update.<br /><br />Is there some kind of benefit to reviewing BEFORE u receive an item that I&#039;m not aware of as opposed to just waiting to write your full experience at one time?<br />

				A friendly request from your neighborhood Mod, even if you finalize early, do not review until you have tried it. And the please DON&#039;T write &quot;Good smoke, got me really high&quot;, do try and be descriptive. Some of these vendors don&#039;t understand the power of a good description. <br />Plus every time you leave a detailed, well thought out, and awesome description your dick grows a bit. <br /><br />~Digi

				This seems like a silly thread, especially with the OP such up in arms over something so trivial. You sound like a control freak.<br /><br />I, myself, like when people state FE. When I&#039;m checking over the listings and see people writing that, I know the vendor is one of those types that require FE without having to read over their entire profile. That way, I&#039;ll have an idea if I want to deal with them or not, most times not. So I find it pretty helpful while I&#039;m browsing.

				Anyone stop to think that if someone leaves feedback saying &quot;FE for trusted seller; will update later&quot; then comes back and updates, unless they leave in the part that says &quot;FE for trusted seller; will update later,&quot; which would make the feedback piss off OP (probably), they more likely erase the whole feedback box and start over?<br /><br />In other words, it&#039;s invalid to say nobody ever comes back and updates, because you are only using examples to the contrary to prove it and those examples disappear when people do what you want them to.

				Its easy to study up on sellers before you buy. I did this and after reading the forums various threads on various sellers gear - plus reading the user comments plus the sellers description - you get a good sense of what is a good deal and what is not.<br /><br />Speed for example has a lot of debate and I think my choice of seller had good speed because all the comments say so!<br /><br />One sellers admits to some trepidation over a batch of speed but some buyers love it and he or she states that they would prefer previous buyers.<br /><br />One UK seller is doing a gram for the insane price of one bitcoin! By reports its well worth the buck - its a basic &#039;ok&#039; street speed.<br /><br />As for finalizing early - I think its valid for people to both do that and state so publically. If a seller has a good rep - and many are finalizing early it shows confidence in the package arriving.<br /><br />New people here will want to finalize when the package arrives which is fair as buying here the first time is &#039;will it or won&#039;t it&#039; process. <br /><br />As stated people can actually go back to their comments in the user panel and add more information such as how long it took to arrive - if it was as described and hopefully a little review as to the quality of the said product.<br /><br />Admittedly I did not know you could change or edit your comments but now I know I will always add a review of the testing of the goodies.<br /><br />So in conclusion stating finalizing early - or even &#039;FE&#039; - is valid and has some use. But edit the comment when you have more insight as to the wonders of whatever delight you purchased. The big question for every potential buyer has to be &#039;Is it the real thing?&#039;<br /><br />Thanks for reading. ;)

				Used to be, escrow was the norm, and it was hard on the sellers sometimes, so we buyers started finalizing early, to let other new buyers know these were trusted sellers, and since we didn&#039;t want to just leave it blank, we&#039;d put in &#039;finalizing early, trusted vendor&#039; or something along those lines. <br /><br />I agree it got bad, and abused of, and yeah, too many new vendors thought *that* was the norm and even started demanding it, but changes have been made, so if it&#039;s a little harder to rip people off.&nbsp; But in any case, telling people what to do never accomplishes what you want, and usually just aggravates them into doing the opposite. <br /><br />I myself don&#039;t much care one way or the other, I always go to the forums, and read what is written there, and don&#039;t go much on feedback, certainly not on &#039;good&#039; feedback, as they can just sell a bunch of cheap shit to run their numbers up.&nbsp; &nbsp;But again, people, me included, just want to help out their vendors, and at the same time, let other people know they haven&#039;t received their product yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Regardless, it&#039;s always important to go back and edit any posts that should be changed, once your product arrives...it&#039;s not that hard to figure out how to edit, and I figured everybody did that, or should do that, if they finalize early for whatever reason.&nbsp; But anyway, this was fought out earlier, and we do the best we can with it.&nbsp; Giving out accurate info is important, but also, the sooner newbies get to the forums, the better off they&#039;ll be...

				I&#039;ve lost big chunks of money (for me) more than once to vendors that had come through multiple times with great product. I still prefer escrow. I find truly professional vendors don&#039;t seem to mind. I guess if someone is really poorly funded then it is an issue, but when they stay that way long-term it&#039;s a sign of some sort of problem anyway.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t have an issue with vendors requesting that unknown buyers finalize early. I think that when vendors request someone finalizes early that they should always use some kind of tracking that can be verified by the buyer. I prefer untracked shipments and I am willing to split the risk with the vendor but I can understand why so many are hesitant to do so.<br /><br />So finalizing early seems to have a place but doesn&#039;t seem like it should be the norm other than for buyers that need to establish a pattern of reliability. I value my reputation as a buyer in the same way, I think, that a good seller values their reputation. Sometimes things happen but with shared financial risk we manage to get through them.<br />

I did this and after reading the forums various threads on various sellers gear - plus reading the user comments plus the sellers description - you get a good sense of what is a good deal and what is not.<br /><br />Speed for example has a lot of debate and I think my choice of seller had good speed because all the comments say so!<br /><br />One sellers admits to some trepidation over a batch of speed but some buyers love it and he or she states that they would prefer previous buyers.<br /><br />One UK seller is doing a gram for the insane price of one bitcoin! By reports its well worth the buck - its a basic &#039;ok&#039; street speed.<br /><br />As for finalizing early - I think its valid for people to both do that and state so publically. If a seller has a good rep - and many are finalizing early it shows confidence in the package arriving.<br /><br />New people here will want to finalize when the package arrives which is fair as buying here the first time is &#039;will it or won&#039;t it&#039; process. <br /><br />As stated people can actually go back to their comments in the user panel and add more information such as how long it took to arrive - if it was as described and hopefully a little review as to the quality of the said product.<br /><br />Admittedly I did not know you could change or edit your comments but now I know I will always add a review of the testing of the goodies.<br /><br />So in conclusion stating finalizing early - or even &#039;FE&#039; - is valid and has some use. But edit the comment when you have more insight as to the wonders of whatever delight you purchased. The big question for every potential buyer has to be &#039;Is it the real thing?&#039;<br /><br />Thanks for reading. ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Remember everyone, this is a discussion about those people who leave FEEDBACK when finalizing early, not about people who finalize early per se. In my opinion, customers should only leave feedback once the product&#039;s received - and I think that needs to be made clearer to buyers.

				I think people are just trying to give as much info as they can, which many of us do appreciate.&nbsp; If they say &#039;finalized early, trusted seller&#039;, we know what that means, and if they leave more descriptive feedback, we know they have gotten product and are describing what it was like...and all the other stuff.&nbsp; If it&#039;s not a &#039;trusted vendor&#039; then don&#039;t put that, just put &#039;finalized early&#039;.... <br /><br />I don&#039;t like &#039;blanks&#039; as it doesn&#039;t tell me anything.&nbsp; Seems like a small thing, and I don&#039;t see why it&#039;s bothersome, even after reading all these posts.&nbsp; People can do what they want, we are free agents.&nbsp; &#039;Live and Let Live,&#039; my motto ;)

				Always agreed with this point - finalize early if you have to - but there is no need to finalize early on their feedback. Its pointless if theyr given a 5/5 before theyv done anything - im sure you think theyll come thru nicely but no harm in waiting it out
