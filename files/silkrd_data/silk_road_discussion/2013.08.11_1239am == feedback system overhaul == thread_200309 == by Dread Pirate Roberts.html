				UPDATE (08/18/2013 2213 UTC):&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; So much feedback and ideas for ratings.&nbsp; I think this will be a major focus for a while until we can really flesh everything out so both vendors and buyers can have all of the information and tools they need to decide who they want to work with.&nbsp; At this point, there are so many things to do, we have to start thinking about what order to do things in and how to transition.&nbsp; Everyone responds to change either positively or negatively, and I&#039;ll keep doing my best to keep the negative to a minimum.<br /><br />An idea I had not yet mentioned, but want to implement is moving discussion to the main site.&nbsp; What I am thinking is that there will be a &quot;discuss&quot; link on every vendor page, item page, and even the category pages.&nbsp; This link will go to a thread with the latest posts about the vendor, item, or category.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking we&#039;ll require a minimum spent of maybe 1 btc to post.&nbsp; Each post will include the user&#039;s account age, total purchased, number of transactions, and number of vendors they&#039;ve bought from.&nbsp; For the item and vendor pages, we can display whether the user has bought that item or purchased from that vendor, and we&#039;ll highlight posts from the vendor themselves when they post on their own thread or a thread of one of their items.&nbsp; I&#039;ll want to enforce a strong policy of courteous conduct and will have a link for you to flag posts for admin review, and we&#039;ll give admins the ability to suspend posting privileges.&nbsp; Also, we&#039;ll want you to have the option to post anonymously, so I think we&#039;ll put a &quot;discussion name&quot; field on the settings page, so you don&#039;t have to post under your account name.<br /><br />My hope is that this feature will fill in any unexpected gaps that might be created by changes in the rating system, so at worst, free and open discussion between buyers and sellers can be looked to when making decisions.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE (2028 UTC): Ok, I&#039;ve rolled out the first set of major changes.&nbsp; We&#039;ve done away with the percent based rating score entirely and are now displaying the ratings as a bar chart that shows the relative weight of each rating category (1 through 5) and a total average.&nbsp; This chart shows up next to each listing when browsing, and on the vendors page.&nbsp; I outlined the change to the vendor, buyer, and rating weights, but will put it here again:<br /><br />The rating algorithm has been changed to the following:<br />A vendor&#039;s score, which determines their rank and factors into the weight of buyers, is found by adding up all of their sales with each sale multiplied by a factor that starts at 100% now and tapers off to 0% after 8 months.<br />A buyer&#039;s score, which affects how heavily their feedback is weighted when determining a vendor&#039;s rating (not rank), is found by multiplying the price of their purchases by the vendor score of the vendor they purchased from, and then adding them all together<br />A rating/review&#039;s score, which determines it&#039;s weight when averaging with other ratings, is found by multiplying the buyer weight of the buyer leaving the rating, the volume of the purchase, and the same dampening factor used for the vendor&#039;s score.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Normal protocol dictates that updates don&#039;t get talked about until they are ready for release.&nbsp; This is because if they get delayed or put on the backburner everyone won&#039;t be disappointed and the less info that is released the better in general.&nbsp; It also keeps the developers unconstrained as they work on the update.&nbsp; I want to try a different approach for an update we are working on.&nbsp; I want to include the community in the process, get feedback as we go, and pull back the curtain just a little bit.<br /><br />The update we are working on is an overhaul to the feedback, rating and ranking system.&nbsp; The current system has been in place for a long time and served us well, but I believe we can learn from how it has performed over the past couple of years and make some much needed improvements.&nbsp; This system is integral to the proper functioning of Silk Road and affects everyone, which is partly why I want to make this development process public so I don&#039;t overlook it&#039;s affect on all of the various people involved.<br /><br />So, here&#039;s what we have so far...<br /><br />I want to rework how both buyers and vendors are rated.&nbsp; We&#039;ve identified 6 critical dimensions that I think affect how SR users should be judged.&nbsp; They are:<br /><br />buyer weight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total amount spent<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total purchases<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of vendors purchased from<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purchase distribution across vendors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight of vendors purchased from<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account age<br /><br />vendor weight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total sales volume<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total orders processed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total number of customers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sales distribution across customers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight of customers serviced<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account age<br /><br />Some of these are self-explanatory, but I&#039;ll go through the ones that may not be.<br /><br />&quot;Purchase distribution across vendors&quot; is a measure of how evenly distributed a buyers purchases are across the vendors they have purchased from.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say two users have spent $1000 on 10 items from 5 different vendors.&nbsp; If one of them bought 2 items from each of the 5 vendors and spent $100 on each item and the other bought 6 items from one vendor and 1 from the other 4 and spent $900 at one vendor, I think we should judge these two buyers differently.&nbsp; I think the feedback from the one with an even distribution is more valuable, all else being equal.&nbsp; The same is true for a vendor looking at &quot;sales distribution across customers&quot;.&nbsp; If most of a vendors sales are to just a few customers, this is not as impressive at a vendor who has good feedback across a large distribution of customers.<br /><br />&quot;weight of vendors purchased from&quot; and &quot;weight of customers serviced&quot; is a kind of feedback loop connecting the weights of both vendors and buyers.&nbsp; Basically with a vendor who has serviced buyers with a high weight as measured across the 6 dimensions defined above, we should weight them more highly than a vendor who has only serviced low weight buyers.&nbsp; Conversely buyers who&#039;ve made purchases from high weight vendors should be weighted more highly themselves.<br /><br />I think the other 4 dimensions are self-evident.&nbsp; Part of what must be considered is how much to emphasize the 6 dimensions relative to one another, and how to weight high values in each dimension relative to low values in the same dimension.&nbsp; So for example, how much should account age influence a buyer&#039;s weight compared to how much they&#039;ve spent?&nbsp; Should a user who has been around for a year and spent $1000 be weighted higher or lower than a user that has been around one month and spent $5000?&nbsp; Looking at a single dimension, should a vendor who has completed 100 transactions be weighted twice as much as a vendor who&#039;s completed 50, or more, or less?<br /><br />These are questions that are hard to answer without looking at past data and experimenting with different settings and seeing how they affect things.&nbsp; This is something we&#039;ll be doing and sharing with you in this thread.<br /><br /><br />Another thing I&#039;d like to change is how feedback is displayed on vendor and item pages.&nbsp; Right now it just shows up as it is left in a continuous stream of feedback.&nbsp; Instead I&#039;d like to push the higher quality reviews to the top and filter out the low quality ones.&nbsp; There are a few dimensions I can think of to judge the quality of a review:<br /><br />buyer weight (as defined above)<br />amount spent on the purchase<br />age of feedback<br />length of review (just thought of this one.&nbsp; not too long not too short?)<br /><br />Looking at it this way, recent feedback from high quality buyers who&#039;ve spent good money will be seen first.&nbsp; With the age factor included, no one feedback will stick around forever even if a very high quality buyer spent a lot of money.&nbsp; This will also have the added benefit of obscuring how much business a particular vendor is doing.&nbsp; As it is, one can simply count the feedback being left and get a good estimate of how many sales a vendor is doing.<br /><br /><br />There are a couple of other changes I have in mind, but this post is already getting long and complex, so let&#039;s leave it at that.&nbsp; I look forward to your hearing your feedback.

				I&#039;m definitely on board with the new ideas for displaying feedback. I hate going through pages of useless feedback like &quot;good shit&quot;, &quot;5/5&quot;, &quot;thanks&quot; and such. If there was a way to see what I consider &quot;valuable&quot; feedback prioritized over the others it would make the decision process much easier. <br /><br />One thing to consider with your system detailed above is that vendors who pad their feedback might have a reputable buyer account with a good amount of money spent - we don&#039;t want their padded feedback always being shown amongst the &quot;top reviews&quot;.&nbsp; Some vendors may be able to gain an unfair advantage with such a system.<br /><br />Also, another risk when listing the &quot;top reviews&quot; rather than the most recent ones is that when a vendor experiences problems, buyers may not be made aware of such issues since they will not be seeing the most recent feedback but rather the &quot;best&quot; feedback. Viewing recent feedback allows you to make sure the vendor is still on their toes, rather than the fact that they were once in the past.

				weighting it so that high value buyers feedback is more prominent than anyone lowly will mean that scammers will always make sure that the high value customers get their goods and the minnows get done, as you&#039;ll be hiding the poor reviews from easy sight.&nbsp; which will make it harder for objective judgements to be made on whether to trust the vendor.&nbsp; Also, the feedback in its current form allows people to see an early trend if they seller is going bad - either non deliveries, increase in FEs or poor quality.&nbsp; If you&#039;re trying to protect vendors from the prying eyes of LE, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll quickly knock up a script (as will anyone else) to extract the data, however much you try to obfuscate it, so it just keeps the nosey competition and potential buyer scammers away<br /><br />&nbsp;you just want to make it an overall star rating where you have to click on each of the star values to get the reviews?&nbsp; that&#039;d take some of that newfangled scripting stuff which might cause issues<br /><br />for overall weightings, it seems to be fair.&nbsp; Really, what are you trying to fix here though?&nbsp; If you&#039;re trying to make it more nuanced so people will actually leave reasonable feedback scores, I&#039;m all for it but if it still means buyers are still under pressure from the threat of a blacklist to leave 5/5 no matter how good, bad or indifferent the process and quality has been, then why bother?

				hi hi DPR!<br /><br />i like the ideas!<br /><br />as to some of your questions, specifically &quot;who weighs more: a buyer who&#039;s been here a year and spent 1k vs a buyer who&#039;s been here a month and spent 5k&quot;<br /><br />i feel the old saying &quot;money talks.&quot; applies here. simply being an old account and purchasing small amounts every so often i dont feel is equal to someone who spends quite a bit more in a shorter amount of time.&nbsp; that being said - there is definitely something worthwhile to note that a buyer has stuck around for awhile vs a buyer that&#039;s been here under a week or under a month. <br /><br />for &quot;should a vendor who completed 100 tx be weighted more or less than a 50 tx vendor&quot; i think that you cant simply deduce that from a single dimension. the 100 tx could be all $20 items, where the 50 tx vendor could be selling $1000 items, that would mean, to me, that the 50 tx vendor should be weighted higher.<br /><br />personally, for me as a vendor, when i evaluate a prospective buyer&#039;s stats i tend to look for the &quot;avg price&quot; of what they&#039;re buying. so, total spent / number of tx gives me the buyer&#039;s approx spending habits. <br /><br />now, speaking for myself again, i have a few customers that have come back for more purchases a number of times. how would you suggest to weigh that? i feel they come back to me because the service is excellent and the price is fair... should that count more than someone who blasts out a bunch of one-off orders and the customers never return? could this be abused by vendors who offer &quot;grand opening or limited time sample sale - limit X per customer&quot;?<br /><br />i&#039;m not so crazy about weighing the item feedback based on character count. when i was young, i always got in arguments with teachers who wanted essays of a certain # of words. i hated that. i feel if you can properly get your point across in 5 words, then there you go. no need to get all verbose to make a point. (for the record i won those battles and was a straight A student)<br /><br />as for prioritizing feedback left on the vendor pages, i happen to specialize in a specific product. some vendors have a multitude of products with very very different prices. does this mean their lower cost items will rarely have visible feedback?<br /><br /><br />while we&#039;re on the topic of feedback..... please please PLEASE make it so that buyers can not change feedback!! it should, however, be plainly obvious to the buyer that they do not need to write feedback when they finalize, and should only write feedback once they have tried the product. i feel this would completely eliminate feedback extortion scamming. i would personally be much more open to dealing with new buyers if that were the case. as it stands now, i have a moratorium on new buyers due to this.<br /><br />finally, it&#039;s quite cool that we get to influence an upcoming feature :)<br />xoxo<br />-mb

				Major search engines such as Google have a similar type of problem when deciding how to rank search engine results. To prevent users manipulating the system they make minor changes to their ranking algorithm(s) on a regular (daily?) basis, and periodically they have a major shake up. Perhaps the new code could be written with this in mind?

				just an idea, but what about an ebay/amazon sort of thing like 5 star ratings - clickable to see them 4 star, 3, 2, 1.. <br /><br />that way it address the issue of possibly scamming low end buyers?<br /><br />just an idea.

				Sounds like ones credit score!! :)&nbsp; On one hand you have the ability to create a fluid, highly sensitive system that could potentially rate the buyers and sellers through a system of weights and measures. And on the other hand you can look at other sites that have gone the complete opposite route using extremely simple methods to rate their buyers and sellers.&nbsp; <br /><br />I see you have chosen factors that can be weighed universally, which is necessary, but since there are only so many parameters to choose from that can actually carry a universal weight it leaves you wondering exactly what type of customer do you truly have after the computation is complete.&nbsp; I think the parameters you have chosen are good -&nbsp; total amount spent, total purchases, vendors purchased from, purchase distribution across vendors, weight of vendors purchased from, account age.<br /><br />A good way to test this concept is to compare two completely different buyers (one well respected buyer and another not so respected buyer) using equal vendor weights to see how each would be reflected.&nbsp; <br /><br />But yes, the question now is how much weight should each individual factor equal overall.&nbsp; <br /><br />IMHO, I would weigh each in a percentile such as this:<br /><br />-Buyer<br />&nbsp;35%- total amount spent <br />&nbsp;30%- total purchases<br />&nbsp;15%- number of vendors purchased from<br />&nbsp;10%- purchase distribution across vendors<br />&nbsp;5%-&nbsp; weight of vendors purchased from<br />&nbsp;5%-&nbsp; account age<br /><br />Haven&#039;t thought much about the sellers but maybe we could do something similar with that too. <br /><br />Whatever we decide I just want to mention that I have secured the domain DPRsList.com in anticipation of this turning into the Angie&#039;s List for drug dealers.&nbsp; I see a future in this :)

				First of all, thanks to DPR and crew for actively listening to the small folk.&nbsp; Big love. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200309.msg1436980#msg1436980">Quote from: missbliss on August 11, 2013, 01:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />now, speaking for myself again, i have a few customers that have come back for more purchases a number of times. how would you suggest to weigh that? i feel they come back to me because the service is excellent and the price is fair... should that count more than someone who blasts out a bunch of one-off orders and the customers never return? could this be abused by vendors who offer &quot;grand opening or limited time sample sale - limit X per customer&quot;?<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes!&nbsp; I love this idea.&nbsp; Customer loyalty should be a very important aspect of any legitimate vendor&#039;s business.&nbsp; Dedicated vendors also deserve the best, most hassle-free customers. This new system gives those customers a more organized ladder to climb, and more incentive to climb it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200309.msg1436980#msg1436980">Quote from: missbliss on August 11, 2013, 01:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />while we&#039;re on the topic of feedback..... please please PLEASE make it so that buyers can not change feedback!! it should, however, be plainly obvious to the buyer that they do not need to write feedback when they finalize, and should only write feedback once they have tried the product. i feel this would completely eliminate feedback extortion scamming. i would personally be much more open to dealing with new buyers if that were the case. as it stands now, i have a moratorium on new buyers due to this.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It seems simple enough that vendors could possibly break new buyers in with &quot;sample purchases only&quot; policies. This would also prevent their feedback from weighing in heavily.&nbsp; More of a screening process than a moratorium.<br /><br />Ability to change feedback may be important to newer users due to inexperience.&nbsp; They may have negative thoughts at first and change them after research, further sampling, etc., or vise versa. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Why do we have to be assigned a single credit score number like cirrus mentioned?&nbsp; Why not make all these categories sortable?... or let us display their/our page in this or that way (e.g. display all items in USD, BTC, or some other currency).&nbsp; Obviously these categories hold different levels of importance for different people... some may think amount spent is most important, while others something else.<br /><br />The same with feedback.&nbsp; I like being able to see feedback displayed as a timeline so I can see trends... but I&#039;d also love to be able to hit a button and see feedback arranged by amount spent, buyer SR age, rating, etc.&nbsp; This would give me many angles I could look at and judge.<br /><br />Maybe this is suggesting way too much though.<br /><br />Guess I just don&#039;t buy into the whole aggregate scoring... whatever factor ends up holding the most weight in it will be exploited anyhow.&nbsp; Might as well give us the whole picture imho.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anywho... just hope I&#039;m not going to be punished for being loyal.<br />

				These are a very good set of metrics to base the feedback&#039;s weight on. <br /><br />Though it might seem counter-intuitive, new/newish vendors would be wise to NOT do business with very active long term buyers given the additional weight their feedback carries versus a newish, less active buyer. One 1/5 left by a single active long term buyer can undo weeks of 5/5s from average buyers and would take a slew of 5/5s left by relatively active medium term buyers to undo. Heck, even a 4/5 or 3/5 left by a single active long term buyer can shave off a lot of percentage points from the newish vendor&#039;s rating. All of which makes veteran buyers &quot;persona-non-grata&quot; to newbie vendors. <br /><br />The exception would be to do business with veteran buyers who have a good forum presence and reputation. They are less likely to commits acts of feedback blackmail on new vendors and are more forgiving of newb vendor mistakes. <br /><br /><br />But there&#039;s one critical element that must be addressed with regards to feedback and that is the duration period to leave feedback and ability to change feedback. <br /><br />Currently, it&#039;s something on the order of up to about 4 months that a buyer can change feedback. There is no viable excuse or scenario where something of this sort is necessary. In 3 months, a buyer&#039;s weighting can change if they&#039;ve been very active since they left a vendor feedback. That would change the weight of the feedback even though the original feedback&#039;s weight has been aged some what. If this buyer has done a few bulk buys since they left a particular vendor feedback, the weight of the old feedback would necessarily increase. <br /><br />The duration to leave or change feedback should be limited to 2 weeks after order finalization.&nbsp; This will of course negatively affect those who finalize early, especially for international orders. But you know what? That&#039;s an additional part of the risk they take by not staying in escrow. But more importantly, it puts a sense of &quot;urgency&quot; to feedback which should also help with deterring feedback blackmail. Those who engage in feedback blackmail would have a limited time in which to effectuate their nefarious plan. The run the risk of the vendor not complying with their evil plan and them not being able to change the feedback back to a 5/5. If their clock runs out and they can&#039;t change the 1/5 blackmail back to a 5/5, the feedback blackmailing buyer runs the critical risk of being blacklisted and exposed for their attempt at fraud.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />TL;DR:<br /><br />DPR, limit the duration that a buyer can leave or change feedback from the current 3+ months to 2 weeks after finalization.

				With this &quot;weighting&quot; system, will buyer&#039;s and seller&#039;s &quot;weights&quot; be publicized? As like a number, or how would this work? Or perhaps that&#039;s what you&#039;re trying to figure out.

I would prefer 3-4 weeks to be able to change the number because, as posted above me, it the product is bunk or whatever the rating should be able to change as well as the comment. Otherwise, the feedback would say &quot;shit shit shit&quot; with a 5 star rating. If people are skimming over the feedback, they&#039;d just see the 5 and continue on. However, I see where you&#039;re coming from. How about 2.5-3 weeks? Pick one and you got yourself a deal.

				If this is to stop vendors gaming their scores then you&#039;re into a whack-a-mole scenario.&nbsp; Whatever you do they&#039;ll work it out (because there are people who are so determined to sell that they will do what they can) and work around it.<br /><br />Also, if you are going to use averages for buyers and sellers ( average amount spent per transaction on the site for buyers and average amount purchased from the seller) to map their weighting to, then zero transactions distort everything and just getting rid of zero transactions doesn&#039;t help because people will just increase it to a few .000s of a bitcoin.&nbsp; Removing anything under say .1 btc should remove that particular gaming temptation but will affect new sellers trying to build a reputation with samples. <br /><br />wouldn&#039;t it just be easier to create a job that runs that looks for some of the more common characteristics you&#039;ve identified of feedback fraud and then do a visual inspection?

				can we set something up so we can see the buyer when you go to the feedback whether were a vendor or buyer. maybe be able to see anyones total amount spent if they even send a message to and SR vendor so we know if there talking out there ass or are serious. maybe its a bit of something against there rights or something but if its all anonymous it shouldnt matter. its numbers and they want to talk numbers lol so we should be able to see.

				I&#039;ve always thought it a little strange that finalizing orders and leaving feedback were all part of the same function. On most e-commerce sites, the seller getting paid and the buyer leaving feedback are two completely separate functions. I advocate a system whereby buyers finalize when they receive their orders and then leave feedback if and when they choose. Once they leave a feedback, it can never be changed, i.e. edited for content, but it can be removed by the buyer if the situation warrants, say if the vendor and buyer resolve the buyer&#039;s issues without going to SR resolution. And of course feedback can be removed by site admin if it is in violation of site policies.<br /><br />True, a lot of buyers will never leave feedback, but a lot of buyers don&#039;t leave feedback with the current system, unless you consider Leave Feedback Here or &quot;thanks&quot; to be helpful feedback.

				I&#039;m with Jack N Hoff, <br /><br />For once SR only has to look at its competition to see how feedback should be done correctly, <br />While this system is better just like the method used to calculate fees it&#039;s all very confusing/behind the scenes and the metrics used to calculate are not really clear or at the very least confusing to the average user. <br />You are still a better marketplace overall than Atlantis but I cant praise their feedback system highly enough and in this case your not really losing face to copy some aspects of it<br /><br />Feedback is locked to prevent vendor threats (or at least makes the issue of retroactively intimidating a customer for a 4/5 moot) <br />Buyer feedback, Buyers are assigned a unique &quot;ID&quot; So you can easily see the 20 reviews for a vendor are from 20 accounts (making it much more time consuming for scammers to game feedback since they would have to setup 20 accounts to do this) <br />Feedback also includes the value of the transaction so same scammers would have to pay fees for each of their &quot;padded reviews&quot; thus making it expensive to even get into the scamming business&quot;<br /><br />What you propose is an improvement but like some posters have said people will still find the easiest method to exploit it.

				We could maybe even make it point based too... such as each transaction is worth one point. Your total amount spent can be based on a tiered system such as every $100 is worth 1 points, or something like that.&nbsp; Vendors can be tiered by points too from 1 to 3 points.&nbsp; So for example buying from a well established vendor can earn you up to 3 points per transaction, and buying from a newer vendor is worth 1 point.<br /><br />There could even be things that could cause you to loose points, such as inactivity for over 5 months will trigger a point loss, or even causing orders to go to into resolution that result in a refund could net you .5 points... or something like that.&nbsp; I&#039;m only throwing out some thoughts. :D<br />

It all depends on who&#039;s leaving it and for what order. That&#039;s why vendors want a 5/5 all the time and blacklist buyers who are nitpicky and shave off points for relatively little things. We don&#039;t want other vendors to have to lose points over this buyer with unrealistic expectations. Or scammers who use feedback as blackmail.

There&#039;s lots of BS to go around. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That being said, for the current work, if a weighting system is introduced a view toggle should be introduced along with it.&nbsp; As others have said, &quot;Customer weight&quot; (call it &quot;frequent customers&quot; or something in the UI) should be switchable to Most Recent.&nbsp; Can&#039;t take away the most recent; if a vendor is stellar but starts to fall off, only a most recent view is going to show this to buyers.&nbsp; You need the most recent view to protect them.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see with a weighting system is that it enforces a sort of classism amongst vendors.&nbsp; If you know that somebody&#039;s review will &quot;count less&quot; you can inherently deprioritize the processing and shipment of their order.&nbsp; This information should not be available to vendors.&nbsp; It should be an invisible part of the weighting algorithm.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You really, really have no idea how the system works. Again, not your fault. Many vendors don&#039;t either. It&#039;s all a big secret. It can be partly reverse engineered. But there is no classism or metrics to properly discern who counts more or less. It is literally a guess - educated or gut feeling guess. If you have a refund rate or a few auto-finalizations on your history, you might get your order cancelled and rightfully so. You&#039;ve demonstrated that you&#039;re a PITA to deal with. If you&#039;ve been making so many purchases then suddenly make a purchase that is larger then the previous sum of your purchases... red flag. If you&#039;re on a blacklist, a vendor can decide if they want to be bothered with you or not and when and for how much. Best bet... stay off the blacklists. It&#039;s easy. You can leave a 5/5 but comment on what bothered you. Most vendors don&#039;t mind truthful feedback commentary. It&#039;s mostly viewed as constructive. Docking points is viewed as destructive. Unless really warranted. Major fuckups cry out for a 1/5. Keyword1: Major. Keyword2: fuck. ups. (or fuck downs. depends on your point of view.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The &quot;FE 5/5&quot; reviews need to go away, period.&nbsp; This is the biggest problem with the feedback system and should be higher priority than any weighting algorithm.&nbsp; Purchasers should be able to choose &quot;fund directly&quot; or &quot;use escrow&quot; and the feedback mechanism should be decoupled from this, enabling a review to go in once a product has been received or dispute resolution has been reached.&nbsp; Just having another state on the orders page; &quot;awaiting review,&quot; that occurred after finalize (and finalize not requiring a review) would solve so much.&nbsp; Leave it to vendors to PM followup and ask for reviews if customers don&#039;t leave them.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Mmm...

Not here, not ever. Most buyers aren&#039;t responsible enough to use it properly. <br /><br />Come on brother (or sister), look at what is sold here. Drugs. Drugs that can and are often abused.<br /><br />Scenario:<br /><br />You get someone in withdrawal or about to be who ordered 1st class mail, who&#039;s asking a vendor every 5 minutes, &quot;did it ship yet? Huh? Huh? Huh? Answer me goddammit!&quot;&nbsp; <br />What kind of stars you think he or she will leave with regards to vendor communication? <br /><br />Quality? So much plays into that. Tolerance for one, certainly does. Many don&#039;t even understand the bio-mechanics of tolerance to a drug. (That&#039;s how we get so many people harming themselves on opiates. They take a break, tolerance drops, and when they return, they start off at the dosage they left off at and bam! Overdose.)<br /><br />Stealth? Some think everything should be in triple MBB packaging inside a hollowed out book or stashed inside a $100 pair of Beats headphones. They have no idea about how the postal system operates and the procedures involved. They don&#039;t even know anything about Federal law in the US. Package got there. Packages keep arriving. So maybe there&#039;s a method to the madness that you, the buyer, didn&#039;t contemplate? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And for disclosure, the above are my opinions and I am NOT a buyer who would weight highly in this system.&nbsp; I would be closer to the end of the list.&nbsp; But I&#039;m still somebody :-)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, first thing we can agree on.

I feel like it&#039;s just going to complicate things. I&#039;ve never once gotten fucked over by a vendor. It&#039;s not that hard- read their profile page, the first 3 pages of feedback, the last 3 pages of feedback, and some random ones in between, then search their name on the forums. <br /><br />As mentioned earlier, this makes me more confident we have a new captain. If this is a new DPR, I wonder what the original would say about this.<br /><br />For vendors saying they don&#039;t want buyers to be able to change feedback or only have a short time to do so, I don&#039;t think that makes sense. I&nbsp; leave feedback regarding shipping time, packaging, vendor him/herself, and initial reactions of the product when I receive it. Then I try the product and update the feedback accordingly. I can see how 3+ months might be a bit much but sometimes it takes a little while to consume. I think a month to update would be good. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />30 days is long but is better than the almost 4 months currently allowed. But even 30 days is too long really. Is a detailed review comment all that necessary? It&#039;s nice, sure. No doubt. But it shouldn&#039;t have anything to do with the rating #/%. All that really goes into considering the feedback rating number can be assessed in a few days after receiving it. <br /><br />I mean, who&#039;s really reading the long feedback comments? It&#039;d be great if buyers would read vendor profile pages which most don&#039;t as evidence by the questions they ask that are already answered on the profile page.<br /><br />Tell you what then. Comprise time. 2 weeks max to be able to change rating number and an additional 2 weeks to only modify the comment. Fair enough?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Good fucking response. I appreciate your professional and thought out response. +1. I would prefer 3-4 weeks to be able to change the number because, as posted above me, it the product is bunk or whatever the rating should be able to change as well as the comment. Otherwise, the feedback would say &quot;shit shit shit&quot; with a 5 star rating. If people are skimming over the feedback, they&#039;d just see the 5 and continue on. However, I see where you&#039;re coming from. How about 2.5-3 weeks? Pick one and you got yourself a deal. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m cool with up to 17 days (2.75 weeks) after finalizing. Gives wiggle room because a buyer can extended it by not finalizing immediately after receiving their order. So in a way, you get your 3 weeks give or take. <br /><br />But...<br /><br />Reading JackNhoff&#039;s commentary about Atlantis... I did not know that they locked in feedback. Having been a long time buyer on SR myself, I don&#039;t know how comfortable I am with immediately locked feedback. Have to be honest. The thought makes me want to hold myself and tell myself it will be OK while fighting to recoil a finger away from the mouse button that&#039;s about to click &quot;submit.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;

				ok, a couple of thoughts I&#039;d like bring up...<br /><br />This idea of decoupling feedback from the transaction is interesting.&nbsp; Right now, when a transaction is completed, a big box shows up on the order page with a 1 - 5 and message field, so just about everyone fills it out in order to remove it from their page.&nbsp; They could wait as long as they like to fill it out, but many fill it out as soon as it&#039;s available, even if they haven&#039;t tested their product.&nbsp; So, what if we removed the message field and left just the 1 - 5, and instead put a link to &quot;review this item&quot; and &quot;review this vendor&quot; on the vendor and item pages.&nbsp; Instead of a stream of little comments, you&#039;d get reviews left only by people who really want to leave the review.&nbsp; This, I think, would be enough to hide the true volume of any given vendor as many customers are fine leaving a 1-5 rating and not a message.<br /><br />Another suggestion I really liked was being able to sort the feedback.&nbsp; Some sorting options might be &quot;newest&quot; and &quot;buyer weight&quot;.<br /><br />Also, I think some of you misinterpreted the OP, thinking that I want to roll up everything about a buyer into a single score and hide the rest.&nbsp; This is quite the opposite.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to make the buyer stats easily accessible so you can judge the review according to your own tastes.&nbsp; The six dimensions I listed were the only ones I could think of that might be important to someone judging another&#039;s review.&nbsp; I could pose the question differently... What information about the transaction and buyer would you like to see next to a review?

				Well, just providing all the buyer stats to the seller makes it simple instead of trying to create some combined rating.&nbsp; As far as the information that can be seen next to the transaction about the buyer would probably be the age of the account and the number of vendors they purchased from.&nbsp; This allows those who see feedback to have an idea how much credibility to give the reviewer about the transaction.&nbsp;

				DPR, <br /><br />Feedback rating decoupled from feedback comments is a great idea. <br /><br />Whatever you do, keep in mind the security of buyers and seller alike. Also be careful not to give new buyers the wrong impression that this site is other than is at its core, a black market. Otherwise they will fail to maintain a healthy amount of skepticism and paranoia and do stupid things that may have life long consequences. While Libertarianism is about self empowerment, it&#039;s also about self defense. The best way to assist buyers in self defense is to NOT make this site like an Amazon.com.

				I would like to see the link next to feedback in profiles labeled &quot;Item&quot; for an Item no longer listed to still show legacy listings in some manner so you can still see what the FB was for. This would help if a vendor sells multiple unrelated products and you want to see if the &quot;weak product&quot; comment was for pot or coke.... <br />&nbsp;Also this would help identify padding if you see great feedback for some lowball priced item no longer listed, since I assume vendors are less likely to pad themselves via huge priced items since they will cost them more in fees.

Especially for custom orders, low volume items, and vendors who aren&#039;t selling multiple orders per day. Worse, feedback scammers/blackmailers would have increased attack area since they can claim that an anonymous feedback was left by them. Vendor might given in to their demands not realizing that it wasn&#039;t them in the first place. Too much anonymity brings out the worse in some. <br /><br />Ship speed, stealth and quality are all too subjective measures and are metrics that can be used by LEO to profile a vendor with greater ease especially if a search/sort feature is added. There are vendors who purposely only ship on certain random days to avoid profiling. If you let buyers rate shipping speed, some of those vendors would be unfairly rated. Stealth... another very subjective measure meant only to calm the fears of the paranoid. The vendor who has been shipping weed for 10 years using tried and true methods might get docked for not using MBB which is all the rage by the overly paranoid. Not to say it&#039;s not effective. It&#039;s just not as necessary as many are lead to believe in all circumstance. Plus that rating would would mark some vendors as primary targets for LEO. There&#039;s a reason why packaging is not allowed to be discussed in feedback. And many vendors change up packaging methods every so often. So rating stealth means you might be rating an already obsolete method. <br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about stealth, ask a vendor before purchasing. They would appreciate it because many vendors don&#039;t like doing business with fussy buyers. A common complaint about buyers especially the new breed. That&#039;s why it looks like DPR is warning us all ahead of time that mainstreamers will be signing up after the article is posted bringing with them all their unrealistic eBay-like expectations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Interesting times ahead. I just hope DPR &amp; co don&#039;t make a feedback system that aids LEO in profiling vendors. Make those LEO bastards work for it.

Trying to make some type of complex archaic formula weighting a slew of factors to rank vendors (or buyers for that matter) is IMO an exercise in futility. Not to mention one serious math headache. <br /><br />Just decide what data you can make viewable, and give people menus to sort by. I think this is the most logical choice for a free market. Let the people decide what ranking factor is most important to them.<br /><br />I also really love the idea of having the endless stream of &quot;Leave feedback here&quot; and &quot;thanks&quot; feedbacks not crowd out all my good feedback. <br /><br />I know for some reason you want to limit the &quot;scope&quot; of a &quot;feedback system overhaul&quot; to completely ignore buyer feedback...but I can&#039;t help myself:<br /><br />I would be very careful implementing a feedback system overhaul without implementing buyer feedback at the same time. I know it&#039;s a lot of work to do at once, but I think the community is willing to wait for a well polished product. <br /><br />I even think that you could make things much simpler than they are in a way by combining these issues. Do it like amazon does it - completely remove the obvious demand for people to leave feedback to &quot;get rid of the window&quot; in their orders page. If they want to leave feedback, they can. What incentive will they have? Two fold: Buyers who have received bad product will obviously have incentives to complain about vendor out of frustration, and more importantly, buyers who receive good product will have an incentive to leave a quality review because then when the vendor leaves feedback for the buyer, it will be better!<br /><br />I hope that makes sense. I really do think it is all one interconnected and very important circle. To ignore the need for appropriate evaluation of buyers seems folly to me. The way things are now though, I suppose the only factor that really matters at all for buyers is total amount spent:<br /><br />If you are not going to change anything else about buyer feedback, like letting vendors leave actual feedback; at least you should change the default number in orders page to show total amount spent rather than transactions. Total # of buyer transactions is 100% completely useless. Completely. Total amount spent and refund % in percentages. Should look like this: <br />Buyer ($1,567/0%). Would be infinitely more useful. As it is right now, I literally do not ever bother to read buyer stats. Don&#039;t see the point. Maybe options to in account settings to choose the default display? Putting bandaids on real wounds though I suppose, really we just need buyer feedback and we need to not tiptoe around the issue. <br /><br />Not mention buyer feedback in a thread for &quot;feedback system overhaul?&quot; I do not think it is wise to have the &#039;scope&#039; quite so narrow DPR.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				@ DPR<br /><br />How about limiting the time frame someone can edit their feedback. Also if they do edit it...then make it so the original can stay up there. Also make it so that if a buyer go&#039;s to resolution and loses....&nbsp; they can not leave feedback.<br /><br />I think you should take a que from eBay. Also a lot of buyers use the feedback system to thank the vendor. I do not think it would be a good idea to not have them leave comments but a link to leave them somewhere on the forums...as a lot of people will not take the time to do that. Also a lot of buyers are not forum members.. I know there are buyers who have spent over $100k+ that do not have forum accounts.<br /><br />What is important for the buyer is to know how long the seller has been here for...how many transactions they have done successfully. I know you put the 300 there for a reason....as maybe you thought it was &quot;bad&quot; if a vendor showed they have done 4000 transactions...as they would not like LE to target them. And if they feel that way then they can go into stealth.<br /><br />But the fact is...that if you are a vendor with over 4000 transactions and all of them are 5/5...then you should be rewarded...and I would think a buyer would feel a lot better using a vendor with those stats...then one with 200 transactions... and some 5/5.<br /><br />Also you commented how a vendor could sell themselves $0 listings and leave themselves feedback. I actually think this happens a lot less then others seem to think...BUT the fact is it can happen. So it would make a lot of sense that feedback for transactions over $500 or whatever amount you feel is right...from buyers who have purchased over $25k in orders... should have a lot more weight...A LOT MORE... then a $0 order from a newbie. And I saw that you now do that...I think at least on the $$ side...but I think it should even have more weight....Also I do not think you have it where a buyer that has spent $25k+ has more weight then a buyer that has spent $300.<br /><br />The bottom line is feedback is there to help others trust that vendor. So anything that addresses that is good.

				Often I see buyer feedback that indicates everything went well and that they &quot;will report back once tested.&quot; <br /><br />9 out of 10 do not return. I&#039;ll dig through the feedback but if I go back a month what&#039;s the likelihood that the product is exactly the same as what the vendor is selling now?<br /><br />Would be interesting to investigate if users can link their forum review to the feedback to leave on the vendor page. <br /><br />Vendors have issues with the current system also and do make it better they quote feedback on their profile page - but this isn&#039;t pulled across onto specific product pages. <br /><br />Great idea though DPR.

Also a buyer that has been around for 1 year...that has spent 100k+ ...that has200+ orders...and has used 10+ vendors...should have more weight then the buyer that has been here for 1 day, spent $5, placed 1 order.

PERIOD.<br /><br />The feedback system should be in place to help the buyer understand that the vendor is legit and trustworthy. And a vendor that has been around a long time, that handles high volume and high priced volume should be more trusted then a new vendor that does neither. And the fact is that if you chose that vendor...and you do not FE..then you are in great shape. <br /><br />In fact....you can choose any vendor...and be in great shape if you just FE. PERIOD.

				Brownie points would go to you if this could be something that is user customizable (under an &quot;advanced&quot; tab unlocked after a buyer&#039;s 5th purchase for newbie safety). Possibly a list of cleverly named presets that include a short description followed by a bullet list of the pros and cons of using each method. The default would of course be the site standard.<br /><br />If I had to number the weights:<br /><br />buyer weight<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;total amount spent -25<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;total purchases - 25<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;number of vendors purchased from - 20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;purchase distribution across vendors - 10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;weight of vendors purchased from - 5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;account age -15<br /><br />vendor weight<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;total sales volume - 25<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;total orders processed - 25<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;total number of customers - 15<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sales distribution across customers - 10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;weight of customers serviced - 10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;account age - 15<br /><br /><br />I like the idea of locking feedback in after a certain time but would it also be possible to include timestamped edit history? Perhaps the post is fully editable for a certain period (two weeks maybe?) and after that time has passed buyers can only leave additional follow up information. The locked feedback would only be revisable if the buyer and seller reach a mutual agreement to do so or a site mod allows it.<br /><br />I agree that feedback should be sortable by preference&nbsp; and that more buyer info should be given. A rough idea of buyer transaction count (or whatever weighting system gets used) should also be provided. As some people might not want the exact number of their transactions made available perhaps their experience should be something like:<br /><br />1=less than 5 transactions<br />2= &gt;5 but &lt;10<br />3= &gt;10 but &lt;25<br />4=&nbsp; &gt;25 but &lt;50<br />5= 50+<br /><br />Granted, the numbers are examples and the real ones should be based on a standard of deviation of a normal curve of the site&#039;s users. I do think it would be wise to put a cap on the buyer weight to prevent LE from easily tracking the top buyers. Granted, there are a lot of people that get stat pride and might want this information but I myself would not want to be the tall one in a crowd. Openly displaying weight can help a buyer surmise whether a seller&#039;s critical reviews are legitimate or if they show signs of selective scamming low rated buyers.<br /><br />It would be nice if the transaction&#039;s weight could be visible as well using a similar rough increment system as above with the intervals being somewhat like 0-10,10-50,50-100, 100-250, 250-500,500+. An $ symbol could denote every level above the $10 mark (or currency equivalent). Once again I don&#039;t make the numbers. It would certainly make it easier to determine legitimacy of feedback considering it is probably not a good idea to include listing information in the feedback profile to help keep things still relatively anonymous. This would make it harder for sellers to pad their feedback without moving large amounts of BTC around, costing them money.<br /><br />The cons of that sytem is dollar weighting wouldn&#039;t cut down on the WU Bitcoin scams as most their transactions are small trivial amounts. They would need to be dealt with separately should this become a bigger issue. I would like to see some improvement on that. Would probably best be solved by some sort of reverse escrow. Then again I wouldn&#039;t be buying coin on SR. There&#039;s a saying about not relieving yourself where you also eat. Buying the coin anywhere else has some sort of plausible deniability about it. There are thousands of legitimate places that use them. Take the time to buy something from one with coin just so you can say you did. /rabbit<br /><br />For all fairness and to make judging buyers easier I believe a categorized ratings system with composite rating would be a more informational way to go. It may prevent a lot of sellers from achieving high numbers but, as a whole, provide more a more accurate feedback rating.<br /><br />I&#039;d want an of 5 star (possibly with half increments) rating for stealth, description accuracy, shipping speed, and communication as well as any additional criteria that might be deemed necessary. The composite rating would be displayed beside the vendor&#039;s username where the feedback score goes now. A composite will be given after 10 feedback. Individual ratings will be available with the reviews and someone could calculate a rough composite. This is to prevent a new seller dropping to the bottom of any searches after making any newbie mistakes that may have damaged their rating.<br /><br />If communication occured, buyer contacted vendor, or other systems took place like resolution center or excess processing time then the buyer would have the option of leaving a rating.<br />If communication did not occur then the rating would be left out of the composite. <br /><br />The theory is, that it would encourage vendors and buyers to communicate with one another more since a good communication score would add additional weight to the review and result in higher numbers should they find their other scores lacking. Most useful for buyers who want to know if long lead times to transit are because of shipping delays or a consequence of the seller&#039;s actions.<br /><br />Description ratings could cause the buyer to look back at the listing and reread the description to determine how well the product matches up. This would cause vendors to do their best to provide good and accurate descriptions on their listings. This would also cause the buyer to think twice about the rating they leave and notice any details they may have missed upon first read. The anticipation of awaiting the package in the mail causes buyers to guild the lily as they build up their own idea of the product in their heads. By the time they have bragged to their friends about their &quot;shipment&quot; they open to box and are disappointed because the product is not as good as expected. By encouraging them to give the listing a second look it could lead to more accurate reviews.<br /><br />Shipping speed is self explanatory and promotes accurate in-transit times. Could be an auto 5 if finalized within a specified number of days. Con: Doing so could be bit iffy because transit times vary greatly by location.<br /><br />Stealth is easy enough as well. Should not be a problem for the sellers that are already up to par. Include a link to an appropriate shipping security thread from the forums.<br /><br />This is just my .002 Btc on the matter. I have seen similar thoughts and ideas, it is just far easier to put them in my words than to spend an hour quoting every single person who touched on a same or similar point I did. This is something that should take a lot of thought and planning and I feel like I spent some good money on a B.B.A. by doing what I can to help this oasis survive.<br /><br />Thanks for listening to us. The collection of ideas en masse are almost always helpful.

				Perhaps vendor and buyer stats should weight recent purchases more than old purchases (I&#039;m not saying heavily weighed, necessarily).&nbsp; It seems like vendors have been able to coast on their previous hundreds / thousands of transactions so that their more recent scamming doesn&#039;t hurt their score enough.<br /><br />Or does the current algorithm already do this?&nbsp; In general I believe the more stats we can look at, the better.

As I did it..And so have a lot of others. And I also think that any item that is $0 should not be counted. Sure it might hurt the new guy a little...But if he is dealing with a legit person...that tried the sample...then that person should buy from him and leave a real review. <br /><br />But what it does protect is the community from vendors stacking their feedback to scam.

				No time to read 7+ page right now and add very meaningful to discuss.

				Another thought: somehow rewarding vendors who work with new buyers. This, after all, is in DPR&#039;s best interest. He wants SR to grow, and for that to happen vendors need to be willing to take a (reasonable) chance with new buyers and, if they do, should be rewarded for it. Good stats mean that older buyers will also want to order from these vendors, so it&#039;s good in two respects.

				no matter what I think changing the display order I think is bad, as a buyer and as a vendor I hold these views!<br /><br />The buyer feed back is a good system to show the current state of the&nbsp; vendor you are about to buy from, if they are currently scamming every one you can see easily from the feed back that they are doing bad things.. other wise you&#039;ll have to dig ( meaning youll never find it at least most wont)&nbsp; The way it&#039;s set up it pormotes good vendor habit&#039;s of being active on the forum to be seen and we all know if someone&#039;s active on the forums they most likely have better communication habits and are more efficient and professional at running their store.&nbsp; As a vendor I like to keep a look at my reviews to see if there&#039;s any issues at all that may come up that I am not aware of seeing as most buyer&#039;s will buy and never respond sometimes..&nbsp; and many who tend to leave bad reviews wont even respond to you ever!<br /><br />Keeping newest reviews current is mainly important for understanding the vendor&#039;s current quality of operation since not all vendors host their review forums habitually as it takes a lot of dedicated time to keep up on it.&nbsp; I personally never used to buy from a vendor unless I A. saw good reviews and no outlier&#039;s in service, and saw a couple reviews on the forums on the vendor&#039;s quality of service could be vouched for by a reputable looking buyer.

It would also weight towards those vendors with a wider product range that reach a larger customer base. &#039;Specialist&#039; vendors wouldn&#039;t build a rep very quickly at all.<br /><br />Also, say a buyer doesn&#039;t enjoy a range of different products and just jumps on for one particular product.

				great ideas everyone.&nbsp; I&#039;m really glad I opened up the discussion.&nbsp; The delivery success rate and transit time metrics are ones I&#039;ve wanted to have for a long time.&nbsp; The problem with transit time is when to count an item as delivered (when it&#039;s finalized?&nbsp; What about FE?&nbsp; Depend on the user to submit the data?&nbsp; What about different postage options like express vs first-class vs. international and variations in the postal systems of different countries?).&nbsp; Then the problem with delivery success rates is the same problem we have with feedback in general, which is fraudulent data, whether it&#039;s vendors padding their own stats, or knocking their competitor&#039;s stats, or buyers using their review as leverage over the vendor&#039;s stats.<br /><br />So as you can see, it&#039;s a tough nut to crack in its own right.&nbsp; For now, I&#039;d like to focus on improving just vendor feedback and reviews.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been playing around with different systems and parameters and seeing how it affects the current and historical stats.&nbsp; One thing I keep coming back to is something that was said earlier in the thread:&nbsp; &quot;money talks&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s looking more and more like the most important parameter for weighting buyers and sellers is simply how much money they&#039;ve spent/earned.&nbsp; Basically, it&#039;s really hard for a scammer to fake feedback from buyer accounts that have spent lots of money with vendors who have lots of sales.&nbsp; I think one of the main reasons for this is that, to fake a transaction, you still have to pay the commission, so pretending to be a top vendor through dummy transactions with high volume buyers simply costs a lot.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gone ahead and implemented one behind the scenes change that I think has improved things a little bit already.&nbsp; The vendor weight, which determines their percent ranking as displayed on the vendor pages is now determined with just two variables: sales volume and age of sales.&nbsp; So, the vendor weight is the sum of all of their transactions, but each transaction is weighted from 100% today down to 0% once it is 8 months old.&nbsp; There is a whole thread in the vendor forum of vendors who are really pleased with the effect this change has produced.<br /><br />I&#039;m still liking the idea of decoupling the 1 - 5 review and the written feedback.<br /><br />Another idea I am liking is displaying not just the average review expressed as a percent, but the actual distribution of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 point reviews.&nbsp; I think this will make it much more acceptable to leave a 4 because instead to damaging the average, it just puts a little more weight in the 4 column.&nbsp; This is something Amazon does and I think we should adopt it.<br /><br />This, I think, is enough to chew on for now and get pushed out into production so we can see it in action.&nbsp; We don&#039;t want to change too much at once because it is hard to foresee all of the effects a change will have until it is actually made.

				sounds excellent ;)<br /><br />Also with the delivered/undelivered stats.. Every stat is going to be manipulated a little bit. But all vendors will probably be on a level playing field. Its just a law of averages..

				I was just thinking about this, not sure if anyone else said before me, but I like the new ideas with the feedback system however I feel like you should put a sorting feature for it kind of like with the listings. Always have the most recent feedback first but have a button so you can switch to see the feedback left by the buyers who have spent the most money, or the buyers who have bought the most items, and so on and so forth. That way people can look at the stats they want depending on what type of order they will be placing with the vendor. I don&#039;t see anyone having a problem with that because it will be exactly the same as before except now instead of JUST having the most recent feedback you can have the feedback that you&#039;re SPECIFICALLY looking for. Hope that makes sense.

				DPR: I hate to bring this off topic as you have previously said not to, but I simply would like to hear your reasoning behind the No Customer Feedback policy that has been here forever. Does it not make sense for vendors to be able to call out users who they potentially believe to be LE/non-finalizers to warn other vendors? Trolls that leave bad feedback for no reason? I am sure you have good reason for not implementing this feature considering it&#039;s been a hot topic since the road was brought up, so please enlighten me.

				<br />lovin the new look!!<br />the new criteria seems fine to me!!<br /><br />regarding the editing of buyer feedback..<br />as a buyer, i feel it very necessary to be able to edit feedback.. especially in the case of a FE purchase..<br />BUT, i do however feel that only ONE edit is necessary!! in case of a burned FE purchase.. and one edit can decrease buyer feedback scamming!! just a thought..<br /><br />much love!!<br />long live SR!!

				I am fairly new to SR considering the age of my account but I have spent roughly $800 in under a month and as I am new I base my purchases on feedback and this forum. I like to scope through the feedback before I decide who to buy through but tbh it really is a pain in the ass sifting through pages and pages of invaluable feedback like &quot;thanks&quot; &quot;5/5&quot; or &quot;Leave feedback here&quot;.<br /><br />Having valuable feedback from respected buyers easily accessible would be an extremely useful resource for newcomers to SR and people looking to try out a new vendor. I think what you are planning is a fantastic update for vendors and buyers.<br /><br />Love seeing the dedication DPR and the community put into SR and I am grateful to be a part of it :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

I then like to wait a few days after testing the product out to leave a review. I can see where vendor&#039;s do not like this and from a buyer&#039;s point of view I would say that 7-14 days after finalizing is more than enough time to leave an adequate review. I would say the limit of time you have to write a review should be 10 days and the once that review is left you should only have 14 days from that time to be able to make any changes to it.

RAWR!&quot; as a buyer, you simply *finalize* once you receive the package, and you have the OPTION to leave *feedback* at that time. but the stars should be set in freaking stone! when you leave feedback that should be IT. that should be THE FEEDBACK! <br /><br />it is not intended to be a messaging system or an extortion mechanism.<br /><br />i will continue to deny all new buyers because of this silly system.&nbsp; the only tools we vendors have keeping buyers honest is tracking information and the looming threat of being put on the blacklist if they choose to mess around. and an established buyer with great stats does not want to be found on those lists, as the stats become meaningless when no one will serve them because of it. those honest established buyers are the ONLY customers i serve. and it looks like it will continue to be that way for some time now....<br /><br />sorry newbies, nothing personal&nbsp; :(<br />xoxo<br />-mb

				Did transactions that happen in stealth not count in the Vendor Stats Transactions box? Also, feedback left for transactions in Stealth, have they vanished?<br /><br />I left a feedback/rating for a vendor last week.. and it&#039;s gone now. <br /><br />Also, another vendor I&#039;m a fan of.. whom I know has a gazillion transactions, their Vendor Stats show like 249 or 250 or something like that.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m looking at it wrong..

				New look is great, the thing i don&#039;t like is the way beside a vendors name before it had (100) ect now its just the name, also there is no overall rating maybe its still getting changed but i think it should be added again as it was easy to see what the vendor was like.

I&nbsp; leave feedback regarding shipping time, packaging, vendor him/herself, and initial reactions of the product when I receive it. Then I try the product and update the feedback accordingly. I can see how 3+ months might be a bit much but sometimes it takes a little while to consume. I think a month to update would be good. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />30 days is long but is better than the almost 4 months currently allowed. But even 30 days is too long really. Is a detailed review comment all that necessary? It&#039;s nice, sure. No doubt. But it shouldn&#039;t have anything to do with the rating #/%. All that really goes into considering the feedback rating number can be assessed in a few days after receiving it. <br /><br />I mean, who&#039;s really reading the long feedback comments? It&#039;d be great if buyers would read vendor profile pages which most don&#039;t as evidence by the questions they ask that are already answered on the profile page.<br /><br />Tell you what then. Comprise time. 2 weeks max to be able to change rating number and an additional 2 weeks to only modify the comment. Fair enough?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Good fucking response. I appreciate your professional and thought out response. +1. I would prefer 3-4 weeks to be able to change the number because, as posted above me, if the product is bunk or whatever the rating should be able to change as well as the comment. Otherwise, the feedback would say &quot;shit shit shit&quot; with a 5 star rating. If people are skimming over the feedback, they&#039;d just see the 5 and continue on. However, I see where you&#039;re coming from. How about 2.5-3 weeks? Pick one and you got yourself a deal.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Also, not all vendors have review pages on the forums or are even talked about on the forums so it&#039;s important to have as much info as possible.

				This has been mentioned before, but it would be better for everyone to give buyers the ability to rate speed, stealth, communication, and product quality separately, like each one has its own 5 stars you can give it. This is alot more important than written feedback which is more onerous to sift through and can often be muddled or vague.

				Well, one thing I have immediately noticed is that this has caused me to appear as a much lower feedback vendor. <br /><br />My &quot;feedback score&quot; used to be 99.8%~. Now it is 4.76/5. That is a very significant drop. For those who are a little slow at math, that means I am essentially now appearing to have the equivalent of what was 95.2% positive feedback before.<br /><br />So I guess my point here besides whining is that it appears to me there are ZERO disincentives in place to stop buyers from leaving false/blackmail feedback. <br /><br />I think this is a pretty serious problem. There really is nothing at all I can see to stop them in place. The vendor blacklist is not an efficient or feasible method to deal with this problem on a systemic scale.<br /><br />What is preventing me from using a buyer account I&#039;ve built up to have very good stats to buy competition&#039;s listings and leave bad feedback? Possibly getting put on the vendor blacklist which only 10% of vendors actually check? What recourse does a vendor really have when that happens? Currently, it&#039;s writing a line about it in your profile! Seems absolutely primitive and barbaric to me. I feel silly doing that, so I don&#039;t. Vendors need to be able to respond to feedback left, maybe even challenge it. <br /><br />Perhaps more importantly, I think what type of feedback a buyer leaves NEEDS to be immediately made part of the visible buyer stats. Has this buyer left 1/5 feedback for the last four items he purchased? Yeah, I&#039;ll think I&#039;ll pass on your business. In a real marketplace we would be able to have access to this information. If you cause trouble for one storeowner in town, they will let the other storeowners know and you may find yourself without a place to shop! This is really the foundation of a Free Society. We want to have a &quot;civilized&quot; society with some amount of order, and that can be done by Reputation. &#039;A man&#039;s word is all he has&#039; is an important phrase that our society will need to learn once again imo.<br /><br />Making all these information about vendor feedback public just gives &#039;customers&#039; even more power and in my opinion will bring out the worst in people and lead to inter vendor wars. But maybe I&#039;m just a negative nancy. (While giving the customer all the power may seem nice to some of you, consider that the customer is NOT always right. this isn&#039;t walmart. some of our &#039;customers&#039; are trying to put us in a dungeon for the rest of our lives.)<br /><br />I know you&#039;re doing a lot already but I feel like vendors are much more vulnerable right now, otherwise I wouldn&#039;t bother to bring it up. And of course the feedback hit I took...curious why that is. Change in the way that number is averaged I suppose.<br /><br />edit to clarify: I suppose a possibility is that now your feedback score is as you say in the OP &quot;a total average.&quot; Which would mean that my little low-value lottery tickets that are only a few cents a piece are now an enormous vulnerability for me. If a &quot;high ranked buyer&quot; leaves 1/5 feedback for a $1 purchase, how much will it affect me in comparison to the same high ranked buyer leaving 1/5 feedback for a $300 purchase? I suspect it will affect me far too much in comparison, and that is the issue here. But I could be wrong.

				Cork1Screw, has some good points. However, I wouldn&#039;t say your feedback &quot;dropped&quot;, it just changed to a new standard. The vendor being able to comment on feedback isn&#039;t a bad idea. I also like the vendor being able to see the type of feedback the buyer has left. That would be an easy way for vendors to spot scammers/people who don&#039;t know how to use SR properly (ie getting packages sent to the wrong address, somebody taking their package, etc.).

				To me it certainly seems like it dropped. 99.8% of 5 is 4.99. 4.99/5 sounds a lot more appropriate than 4.76/5.<br /><br />(I do see your point though, just offering maybe not even my perspective but what I have to assume will be the customer&#039;s perspective, if that makes sense)

				Hi @ all Roader´s!!<br /><br />For me as a buyer it is most interesting at vendor stats,<br /><br />1. how many items were arriving safely and<br /><br />2. the item is off good quality!!<br /><br />So there should be a statistic (like mentioned by GUS) about % received international/national.<br /><br />Even if quality is a &quot;subjective&quot; perception, there should be a rating from 1-10 about quality.<br /><br />The icing on the cake would be, when it´s mentioned if the vendor uses MBB (gives<br />some extra points)!<br /><br /><br />Now the &quot;feedback changing thing&quot;:<br /><br />I had an order at a vendor with (99), he required FE, I did.<br />Then the vendor had some private issues (hacked account, death in family,...) and he didn´t<br />send it out.<br />After 2 weeks I messaged him - no response.<br />Another 10 days later I messaged him again, he unnoticed my order.<br />More than 30 days after placing the order I received the package.<br /><br />So at the end I understood his problems and changed the feedback to 5/5, the quality<br />was very ok! Everybody can get in trouble (gf leaves, death in family,...)!!<br />Even communication was ok when he recognized his fault.<br /><br />I was happy to change the feedback, at the end he earned a 5/5, he even gave a little extra.<br /><br />Everything has 2 sides...

				Oh this is a great update. I&#039;m new, but I just went back and looked at the vendors I sifted through before and the breakdown is much clearer. I can tell, from the little bar graph things, who constantly has issues.<br /><br />I agree with the above comments about needing to ask people to rate the individual aspects of the service. Anything to break people out of this &#039;well, I never got my order and no one responded to my messages, but 5/5 because oh well.&#039; <br /><br />I&#039;d also love to see vendor ranks in terms of numbers, like who is the best seller, etc. I think it would encourage some healthy competition.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t mind the idea that vendors should be able to see my past ratings/feedback. That would actually work in most people&#039;s favor I think. I&#039;m not quite on board with letting vendors, respond though. Just because the responses I&#039;ve seen in the forums are people bickering back and forth. I also left a less than stellar rating recently and got TEN freaking messages from the vendor, most of which made no sense and asked things like &#039;why do you hate us&#039;? So when I think of vendors commenting on feedback, I just see potential for flamewars. <br /><br />Anyway, cool update, thanks :)

But that&#039;s what a number of bad buyers do. <br /><br />The time limit on the ability to change feedback can be segregated:<br /><br />1. International orders<br />2. Domestic orders<br />3. Orders in resolution&nbsp; <br /><br />For none of these is a 4 month ability to change feedback necessary. It&#039;s absurd. The majority of e-Commerce site feedback is permanent. Even on Atlantis, it&#039;s permanent. <br /><br />There was a suggestion to decouple finalization from feedback. That would work. And to set the limit for leaving or changing feedback starting from the point of finalization of an order.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				There is one thing we would like to put emphasis on... <br /><br />Vendors should ALWAYS have access to recent feedback in the order that they are submitted. This way, we are aware if there is any issue at all. We had a minor shipping problem a couple of weeks ago and the feedback helped us a lot to fix the problem. Feedback is useful for bother buyers and vendors, and everyone needs to see what is the present state of a vendor. This needs to stay! <br /><br />We absolutely love that SilkRoad is trying to enhance the rating/feedback system, these are all great ideas. Perhaps a division between Featured Reviews and Live/Recent Reviews would be helpful. While you get the most important reviews on top, you also get a &quot;live feed&quot; of recent feedback.

				Sorry if this or something similar has already been suggested but......<br /><br />I thought about having a default template for leaving feedback that everyone has to use;<br /><br />Something like:<br /><br />Service and Communication = (score out of 5) = (Description of service and communication given)<br /><br />Stealth and Delivery = (score out of 5) = (Description of stealth and delivery)<br /><br />Product Quality = (score out of 5) = (Description of product quality)<br /><br />What do you guys and DPR think to that?<br /><br />

There&#039;s a nice mix of posts supporting both buyers and sellers in my posting history since I&#039;ve been on both sides of the coin. <br /><br />Just pointing out the often overlooked or forgotten aspects of vending. The majority of buyers and vendors are just fine, decent people. But the few bad apples are really bad apples. Plus these bad buyers are capable of having multiple buyer accounts and can switch identities at will and whim. The feedback system is favorable towards their antics and scams. Vendors have been asking SR staff to level the playing field for the longest time and finally some progress is being made. But the progress might end up being superficial if some loopholes aren&#039;t closed up. The biggest one being the ability to change feedback months after finalizing. There is no justification for it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The thing is, if the new feedback algorithm heavily discounts old feedback, then the ability to change feedback weeks and months later doesn&#039;t really matter. Something that would be most important to new vendors who are often victimized by feedback blackmail. <br /><br />You want new vendors to survive to add more choice and price normalization. <br /><br />

There is no viable excuse or scenario where something of this sort is necessary. In 3 months, a buyer&#039;s weighting can change if they&#039;ve been very active since they left a vendor feedback. That would change the weight of the feedback even though the original feedback&#039;s weight has been aged some what. If this buyer has done a few bulk buys since they left a particular vendor feedback, the weight of the old feedback would necessarily increase. <br /><br />The duration to leave or change feedback should be limited to 2 weeks after order finalization.&nbsp; This will of course negatively affect those who finalize early, especially for international orders. But you know what? That&#039;s an additional part of the risk they take by not staying in escrow. But more importantly, it puts a sense of &quot;urgency&quot; to feedback which should also help with deterring feedback blackmail. Those who engage in feedback blackmail would have a limited time in which to effectuate their nefarious plan. The run the risk of the vendor not complying with their evil plan and them not being able to change the feedback back to a 5/5. If their clock runs out and they can&#039;t change the 1/5 blackmail back to a 5/5, the feedback blackmailing buyer runs the critical risk of being blacklisted and exposed for their attempt at fraud.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />TL;DR:<br /><br />DPR, limit the duration that a buyer can leave or change feedback from the current 3+ months to 2 weeks after finalization.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;As a buyer: Two weeks after finalization sounds fair, however, some substances aren&#039;t used right away, and cannot be reagent-tested with sufficient efficacy to determine potency, such as LSD, but this is the exception.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think there should be an option for 1 update on feedback, at about 2-4 weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would allow for FE&#039;d int&#039;l customers to test and evaluate product.&nbsp; Remember, us buyers like to horde chems, especially psychedelics.&nbsp; I honestly think that the current stats speak for themselves.&nbsp; The only time I really update feedback is when I try a new dose or method of consumption, just to help promote the vendor&#039;s product.&nbsp; &nbsp;I honestly pay more attention to the positive feedback, and give little attention to people who would say &quot;this sucks&quot; or something vague like that.&nbsp; The no-feedback leaving people are who piss me off more than anything.&nbsp; I almost think users should be REQUIRED to leave feedback, until they can order again, but that is another issue.

NO ONE is forcing you to leave a rating and feedback words IMMEDIATELY when you finalize. i have personally had quite a few buyers finalize an order, and NOT leave feedback for a day or two. this is PERFECTLY FINE!!! it means they are respectable people who understand the coins are valuable to us vendors and release them when they receive their gear, and that they also want to leave proper feedback when they HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO TRY THE PRODUCT!!<br /><br />there is ZERO good reasons to allow feedback to be changed all the time. the argument of &quot;well, i *had* to FE&quot; is complete BS. NO you did NOT have to FE, and you did NOT need to write feedback early, EITHER. you CHOSE to FE because you wanted to buy from that vendor!!!!! that is even more important of a point to make! these points go together and it&#039;s plain as day that due to naivety/ignorance/misinformation buyers are assuming they need to drop feedback right when they click finalize. this is simply untrue.<br /><br /><br />please DPR, i feel we really need to ditch the constant feedback changing. i&#039;m ok with infinite feedback changes for like 24-48 hours after it&#039;s written, but after that it should be set in stone. so silly that it&#039;s not.<br /><br />and for all the buyers saying this new update favors the vendors: it most certainly does not. there is a major outcry on the vendor forum about this. personally it worked out better for me, and here i am complaining about it! because i know it&#039;s not fair for all vendors!! <br /><br />sorry for the rant, but i feel i have to stick up for what&#039;s right<br />that&#039;s my 2 satoshi<br />xoxo<br />-mb

				I don&#039;t think that people who can afford to spend more money should be heard more loudly. And as a buyer, I don&#039;t want to see more comments from big purchasers than small purchasers. I would like to see all comments in time, and make up my own mind. <br /><br />I think decoupling is a good idea, as it will lead to more helpful comments. <br /><br />I also agree that a little education on how to rate would raise the level. <br /><br />As a buyer it would be helpful to know whether the vendor is great at stealth, not just selling great product.

I&#039;m not certain what I think yet about the proposed forumish integration into the main site, but on the surface it seems like a great idea. There&#039;s bound to be some turmoil over changes to the base mechanics of the site, but I think it&#039;s been pretty minimal over all and you seem to be handling it well.<br /><br />I will say though, that I noticed you did not make any mention of vendors being able to see what feedback customers have left. Not the actual text or reviews necessarily (although I would include that), but just the strict 1/5 average the same as you&#039;ve done for vendors. <br /><br />If a customer has 100+ transactions and a lot of money spent but leaves on average 3.5/5 feedback and recently left a long string of 1/5 feedback...that is an excellent &quot;flagging&quot; system for scams imo, without being too intrusive. Maybe that user recently got hacked, for example.<br /><br />Other than checking blacklist, this would provide a very ready at hand way to quickly get some real insight into a buyers recent attitude/activity without being too intrusive. <br /><br />(P.s. - not discounting that I may have misread your update. Maybe you are already talking about letting everyone see the reviews/feedback buyers have left and just didn&#039;t mention it specifically enough for me to notice)

				So now is it not a cardinal sin to give anything below a 5 as a rating?<br /><br />If I get an order on time, on weight and the quality is good... but the stealth was shitty, does that warrant a 4/5? What does warrant a 4/5 or a 3/5? <br /><br />Any system that still pressures buyers into needing to give a 5 or be blacklisted is flawed.<br /><br />Maybe we should have some sort of posted community guidelines as to what sort of issues and things should cause a transaction to receive under a 5.

It&#039;s not a bad idea. <br /><br />During my days as a buyer, I never left less than a 5/5 mostly because I couldn&#039;t figure out exactly what constitutes a 4/5 or 3/5 or even a 2/5. I wasn&#039;t even worried about being blacklisted since it never occurred to me back then that you could be. The only thing I knew was, I got my order usually hassle free and it came in decent enough time. So 5/5. Some vendors gave a little &quot;street&quot; attitude on occasion but I didn&#039;t think it was anything to dock a point for. Had been in resolutions a couple of times and everything worked out in the end. I got shorted a time or two, but I contacted the vendors and they were cool about it and made it up to me. <br /><br />Saying all that to say, not having had experienced a situation that warranted less than 5/5, IMO, and that didn&#039;t deserve a 1/5, the ratings in between don&#039;t seem to have much practical or sensible use. <br /><br />It&#039;s hard to quantify using numbers how you might &quot;feel&quot; about a transaction. Words like &quot;positive,&quot; &quot;neutral,&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; seem to better convey how someone might feel about the total transaction experience. <br /><br />The numbers from 1 to 5 I guess could be quantified like a survey&#039;s fill in the bubble thing. <br /><br />Such as:<br /><br />5 = positive<br />4 = less than positive, but not neutral<br />3 = neutral<br />2 = less than neutral, but not negative<br />1 = negative. <br /><br />Yeah, looking at it, that doesn&#039;t make sense especially considering that a 4/5 can have as much impact on a vendor&#039;s rating as a 1/5 does depending on who&#039;s leaving it and how much the order was for. <br /><br />Probably need to do away with the number system and move to the 3 word rating system.<br /><br />As miss Bliss would say... that&#039;s my 2 Satoshi.

				Do not like the missing (xx) next to vendor names. Reconsider removing. Replace with VENDOR (4.85) or something so can see at a glance from list of names and can easy tell when vendor is demoted etc. <br /><br />Buyer and Vendor can be scam fuck, important to no give either too much leverage. Also shit happen sometime and should no be able to hurt vendor too much. Balance important.

				Do you think maybe it&#039;s useful to show a number greater than 300 for the amount of transactions has? Not sure if it would add a lot, but I think it&#039;s maybe interesting to see a vendor who for example has 2000+ transactions as opposed to 400.

				To all those vendors clamoring to lock feedback and not allow editing, as a buyer, I&#039;m against this, because there have been a number of times I ordered product I was unable to try for weeks or even months. This becomes particularly important for psychedelics. You can&#039;t just take them upon receipt, at least I can&#039;t. Plus, I have ordered things I didn&#039;t necessarily need at the moment to stock up in case of an SR blackout, as we all experienced several times earlier this year (maybe I&#039;m the only one doing this kind of thing but I don&#039;t think so). I like to be able to edit feedback to include comments on the quality of the product, for the vendor&#039;s benefit, after leaving initial feedback on shipping, stealth, and overall transaction. There are a lot of people who aren&#039;t on the forums, especially with the 50 post requirement to be seen on regular threads - buyers and vendors. Leaving thorough feedback on SR proper is essential for a lot of vendors who might never be seen or discussed otherwise, and invaluable for me as a buyer shopping around. I am absolutely willing to pay more for product based on feedback.<br /><br />I might be SR naive since I&#039;m not a vendor, but if I have a serious problem with a vendor, I take it up with them in PMs to resolve things and come to a mutually beneficial resolution before I leave feedback that could really hurt a vendor. I know SR isn&#039;t some utopia where this happens with every buyer, but I do think most buyers and vendors are decent people. Perhaps you could have a month or two month limit on editing, or limit buyers to a single edit, something like that. I understand vendors&#039; frustrations, I really do. But I&#039;d respectfully ask for the editing feature to remain in some form simply so I can try and do right by each vendor when I can.<br /><br />I totally support the idea of having buyer&#039;s profiles. I think this might help vendors feel more comfortable especially with newbie buyers and encourage more openness all around. We can see so much about vendors, I think turnabout is only fair.<br /><br />Some great suggestions and changes here.

Plus, I have ordered things I didn&#039;t necessarily need at the moment to stock up in case of an SR blackout, as we all experienced several times earlier this year (maybe I&#039;m the only one doing this kind of thing but I don&#039;t think so). I like to be able to edit feedback to include comments on the quality of the product, for the vendor&#039;s benefit, after leaving initial feedback on shipping, stealth, and overall transaction. There are a lot of people who aren&#039;t on the forums, especially with the 50 post requirement to be seen on regular threads - buyers and vendors. Leaving thorough feedback on SR proper is essential for a lot of vendors who might never be seen or discussed otherwise, and invaluable for me as a buyer shopping around. I am absolutely willing to pay more for product based on feedback.<br /><br />I might be SR naive since I&#039;m not a vendor, but if I have a serious problem with a vendor, I take it up with them in PMs to resolve things and come to a mutually beneficial resolution before I leave feedback that could really hurt a vendor. I know SR isn&#039;t some utopia where this happens with every buyer, but I do think most buyers and vendors are decent people. Perhaps you could have a month or two month limit on editing, or limit buyers to a single edit, something like that. I understand vendors&#039; frustrations, I really do. But I&#039;d respectfully ask for the editing feature to remain in some form simply so I can try and do right by each vendor when I can.<br /><br />I totally support the idea of having buyer&#039;s profiles. I think this might help vendors feel more comfortable especially with newbie buyers and encourage more openness all around. We can see so much about vendors, I think turnabout is only fair.<br /><br />Some great suggestions and changes here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree, I am also against vendors being able to lock feedback for the reasons mentioned by loobaloo but also because I have been in a situation where after a purchase has gone to resolution and then finalised for an order not arriving, the order later turned up, so obviously I needed to change my feedback to reflect this. It&#039;s not always about amending feedback to make it poorer, and this was to the benefit of the vendor.<br /><br />Some great ideas to be implemented though, looking forward to the changes and more transparency from both vendors and buyers enabling more informed decisions/purchases.

				Not sure if this has been mentioned, but I think a good addition would be making the feedback ratings click-able, so if someone has 5 rating 1&#039;s or 2&#039;s, you can click on those and go straight to them, right now you have to sort through pages of feedback to see the different feedback.

				I feel like this whole discussion system is just sort of redundant....<br /><br />What would I put into a discussion post that would not be a part of my review if I bought a product from the vendor?<br /><br />What would I want to say about a vendor that I wouldn&#039;t put in their rumor mill thread or some other thread on the forums?<br /><br />Maybe it gives someone without a forum account some sort of voice that isn&#039;t just a review, but if you haven&#039;t ordered from a vendor or actually bought a product why should you be able to say anything public about them anyway? I think that &quot;discussion&quot; is probably going to be less reliable than any reviews that are made after a purchase and real experience with the vendor.

				I think this is the best idea.&nbsp; Buyers never get good or bad feedback, and sellers post on the profile page &quot;by ordering from me you agree not to leave anything but 5/5&quot;.&nbsp; So Almost every vendor, even the ones that suck, have 100%.&nbsp; &nbsp;I literally always have to leave 5/5 even though it was marked in transit when it wasn&#039;t, the vendor doesnt even read any messages, 3 days late, &quot;but priority isnt gauranteed thats why we do it because it can take forever but you still must leave 5/5 and once u order dont even try to message me and think ill respond.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Then they always end up in stealth mode, but they really wouldnt have to if they got to pick and choose who they would let order, and buyers would have access to more sellers as long as they dont ask for refunds half the time

Its not rocket science and you got remember alot of new vendors are here for the ££££/$$$$ alone. I don&#039;t come on the forums a lot due to just the sheer amount of retardedness on here and people that use our services know what were all about! And it ain&#039;t just for the dollar like most new comers. Do you think people who have been here 2+ years have not made there dollar? A lot of good vendors have gone over the time but the really good ones that care about there customers and have a higher goal than just monetary profit are here and serving to the highest standards! <br /><br />At the end of the day its your choice/risk and ive been scammed by Supertrips (£600 on 100G Speed (ENPTY CASE AFTER FE)), TrippyNation(£1100 on 25G 2C-B (NEVER POSTED!)) &amp; a few others over my time. ST is the biggest scammer on here and SR need to ban this fool. Its a shame idiots like him get to carry on scamming people. As for trippynation, Notice his 25G listing as dissapeared! You know why don&#039;t you, Cause my feedback exposed him!<br /><br />You learn all this in time and its apart of this business but eventually we hope we can clean the scum out of this industry and have it with smart, reputable people that can move things forward instead of just been selfish pricks! We can all dream&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Peace &amp; GL to all<br /><br />P.S - Were buyer&#039;s as well as been a seller, Here are our stats without including other &#039;buying&#039; accounts<br /><br />1 month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all time<br />total transactions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95<br />total spent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£1,550.40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£3,847.90 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£9,510.40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£17,962.00<br />total vendors &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57<br />refund rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />auto-finalize rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5%<br /><br />So as you can see..... we don&#039;t mess around. We also care about the small person as much as the big dude! Everyone&#039;s equal when it comes to dealing with us and we do our best to make this community a better thriving one. We welcome competition as it&#039;s all a win win situation and there enough business for everyone in this new world of free markets. This was another reason why we were so disappointed in TrippyNation, Shame really but he showed his true colors by the end. <br /><br />people change there spots when it comes to the crunch, Be aware of imitators!

Many of the suggested changes, such as the vendor discussion, separation of review and rating, rating system improvements, and vendor and buyer stats improvements are all things I have thought about and desired over the past few months. If I had realized that these types of changes were possible and eminent, I would have posted in the forum and contacted staff with ideas. In the future I will be sure to voice my ideas more. It&#039;s interesting how everyone has the same ideas and how they are exposed naturally through this discussion. I think this is very productive. Like others, I have a few concerns that the changes will negatively effect things that I currently use to educate myself about vendors and products.<br /><br />Some more ideas:<br /><br />1) Integrate the official vendor review thread posts into the vendor profile or some of the recent posts like the last 5. This should motivate vendors to be active in their vendor review threads and will be useful to buyers who post in and routinely view these thread posts before buying.<br /><br />2) Show the true number of transactions that vendors have completed or add higher level greater than labels for more than 500 transactions, more than 1,000 transactions and so on. I think this has been mentioned earlier.<br /><br />3) Detection and moderation of shills that are used for trolling / spam / feedback scamming, items listed in the wrong category, items that are getting fake sales / items that people are obviously not buying that have sales (browse digital goods), short bursts of fake sales to boost listing placement and rank in a category.<br /><br />4) Some sort of home page that shows top vendors by category, top products by category/price, user and vendor stats, site stats, newest vendors, newest members, etc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Options... we need options. Not everyone wants all these new features and some don&#039;t want certain things revealed. So give buyers and sellers options to turn on/off some features. <br /><br />For instance, displaying # transactions, that should be under vendor control. They should be able to show 100+, 300+, 500+, 1000+, or &quot;not disclosed&quot;. Some vendors might not want to show the exact number so they can&#039;t easily be profiled by LEO. <br /><br />If vendors can&#039;t be given mod power over discussion on their page, give them the option to turn it on/off. <br /><br />If buyers don&#039;t want to show how much they spent, they should have the option of showing &gt;$500 spent, &gt;$1000, &gt;$5000, etc. or not disclosed. <br /><br /><br />I think we&#039;re getting a little too comfortable and forgetting that this is a black market which predominately trades in illegal items. There needs to be a better balance between security, anonymity, and safety. <br /><br /><br />Also...<br /><br />Vendors now have more work. Not only do vendors have to field daily questions from buyers sent via PM but now we also have to deal with what&#039;s posted on discussion pages. New vendors might have time to deal with this (although adding discussion potentially means they have two attack surfaces to defend, feedback blackmail and now discussion smear campaign blackmail) but high volume vendors won&#039;t have time to deal with both. <br /><br />

				They&#039;re probably trying to get the site up to the standards of the Forbes reading demographic who are all about social media and commenting on every fraking thing. It&#039;s all an attempt to legitimize a black market and bring black marketry into the mainstream. <br /><br />Of course scammers and blackmailers are going to take advantage of the new commenting system. Vendor rivalry is likely to pollute the category discussions as well as individual listing discussions.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;ll probably be a mess. <br /><br />Time will tell, but some things are guaranteed to occur.

				amazon has discussion boards for products and even there most people don&#039;t use them.&nbsp; The good thing about them is that people might get a question answered by others rather than having to wait for the vendor to respond but for most items it will probably not be used..&nbsp; particularly if there&#039;s no way of notifying people they&#039;ve had a response, so they may very likely forget to go back to check.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how it plays out.<br /><br />

				Well, if you look at eBay as an e-commerce business model, the biggest complaint in the early days was that sellers had too much power.

Buyers 12, vendors 0? :p<br />[/quote]<br /><br />The discussion system does seem redundant. And also less reliable than feedback. If anyone who has not actually used that vendor can leave a discussion, how am I supposed to trust that? Especially if I can make 12 accounts randomly and just start discussing vendors in a negative, but not inflammatory way as to incite a mod to delete my posts. Unless mods will just delete any negative post that gets reported.<br /><br />Buyers too need a lot of time to be able to change reviews. Not all of us can receive LSD on a Wednesday and take a whole bunch immediately.&nbsp; Personally, I think I leave good, informational reviews on the products I buy, even if I have to fill in the details in a month. If I don&#039;t try something right away, but it measures out right, came on time and all looks right... I&#039;ll give the vendor the benefit of the doubt and leave a 5 for now. Come back and comment on the quality (always has been good) later.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t get how buyer feedback would be a better measure than stats? Maybe we should add reships as a buyer stat, like we have refund rate. But knowing that I have 16 successful transactions on my account and no refunds should show I&#039;m legit. If I have 16 transactions and a bad comment, because I gave a vendor a 4/5 for shipping a week late, now I look worse and the system isn&#039;t as effective. <br /><br />The real problem with the current feedback system is that its unacceptable to give a vendor anything below a 5 on a review. That is what taints the system. Its not honest and open. <br /><br />Any improvement should just be geared to make it so that if a vendor gets a single 1/5 it does not blow up their entire score. That way, if some buyer threatened to change their feedback a month later, it wouldn&#039;t be such a massive fucking deal if they did. One 1/5 out of 500 transactions can be seen as an outlier to any intelligent buyer. Unless it brings down a sells ranking so drastically.... That system just doesn&#039;t make sense<br /><br />Until the feedback system exists so that I don&#039;t have to give out a 5. It is broken. When I can give a 3/5 because the vendor sold me okay weed, packaged in something not so stealthy that stank, and came a week late, the system is broken. Right now I would have to give that person a 5 and just type that stuff out.

I can agree on one point that you cant stop morons from FEing, but SR can limit the amount a vendor can have in FE&#039;s and his listings freeze when he exceeds that. a vendor can have as many orders in escrow as they want. but when you see 5 pages of FE and the forums are lit up with no orders being received thats BS...many of the buyers are domestic and it dont take 8 days to get a letter. i have received stuff from Germany, UK and canada in 7 days.&nbsp; &nbsp;the other idea is to limit the amount of FEs a vendor can ask for in a weeks time. than they lose it for a week... by than most orders should be received within 14 days.&nbsp; If you have the smarts to develop SR, finding a way to curb this kind of abuse should be easy.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Tell &#039;em. <br /><br />I think DPR is trying to bring the forum, SR side since a lot of peeps don&#039;t read the forum. Problem is, using an alias to post and because anybody can post in a discussion, the discussion has less value than the forum and feedback. DPR thinks it&#039;s more valuable because buyer stats are posted with the post. But because of that, anyone can say any kind of shit and feel safe talking shit. Or so they think. <br /><br />The smart vendors are going to start keeping buyer stats and attach them to aliases and blacklist those talking shit. In a month or two, the discussion feature will be corrupted and unreliable and only a dummy would use it. <br /><br />Vendors will do it. Guaranteed. Because DPR has been ignoring vendor requests for like ever and keeps forcing things on them. <br /><br />Vendors are running out of lube.&nbsp; &nbsp;

On ebay, it takes nothing to become a seller. It makes sense to me that they would have to protect buyers more in that situation. It&#039;s really just apples and oranges if you ask me, I don&#039;t think ebay&#039;s success and silk road&#039;s will be because of the same reasons at all. Just way too many variables there.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t think having buyer feedback would be any worse the current atmosphere of &quot;Leave 5/5 or I&#039;m putting your name on the blacklist!&quot; that seems to be the entrenched attitude in the system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You make a good argument and I have to agree. You&#039;re right, you can&#039;t compare eBay to SR. But it seems that is the way the powers that be are trying to make it seem like. The potential negatives of the new discussion will probably prove to outweigh the positives intended. The fact that it is anonymous on top of the anonymity the site provides is a recipe for trouble. Though it seems that posters can be banned from being able to post in discussions if they violate the arbitrary &quot;be polite, not inflammatory&quot; rule. And of course, anything that a vendor feels is negative can be construed as inflammatory. And in most cases, the vendor would probably be right. But will SR admins agree? <br /><br />A few people opined that the discussion system is redundant to the feedback system and forum. When you think about it, they are probably correct. If feedback can be abused, so can the discussion system. <br /><br />But on the plus side, vendor ratings next to vendor name are back! <br /><br />So what&#039;s the score? Buyers 12, vendors 0? :p<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200309.msg1475036#msg1475036">Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The discussion system does seem redundant. And also less reliable than feedback. If anyone who has not actually used that vendor can leave a discussion, how am I supposed to trust that? Especially if I can make 12 accounts randomly and just start discussing vendors in a negative, but not inflammatory way as to incite a mod to delete my posts. Unless mods will just delete any negative post that gets reported.<br /><br />Buyers too need a lot of time to be able to change reviews. Not all of us can receive LSD on a Wednesday and take a whole bunch immediately.&nbsp; Personally, I think I leave good, informational reviews on the products I buy, even if I have to fill in the details in a month. If I don&#039;t try something right away, but it measures out right, came on time and all looks right... I&#039;ll give the vendor the benefit of the doubt and leave a 5 for now. Come back and comment on the quality (always has been good) later.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200309.msg1475036#msg1475036">Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I also don&#039;t get how buyer feedback would be a better measure than stats? Maybe we should add reships as a buyer stat, like we have refund rate. But knowing that I have 16 successful transactions on my account and no refunds should show I&#039;m legit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think refunds/reships is no doubt an important buyer stat that should be shared. If you have 16 decent sized transactions and no reships or refunds you certainly look legit.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200309.msg1475036#msg1475036">Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> If I have 16 transactions and a bad comment, because I gave a vendor a 4/5 for shipping a week late, now I look worse and the system isn&#039;t as effective. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, I guess I partially agree with this. I think if you have 16 transactions and one vendor was a little upset it might be fair to say you &quot;look worse,&quot; but I don&#039;t think that means the system isn&#039;t as effective. As soon as DPR changed the rating system from (100) to being x/5, my rating went down significantly. I was (100) in the previous system, now I&#039;m (4.8) in this system. Do I look worse? Yes. Does that mean the system is necessarily less effective? No. Your next points highlight the real problem I think.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200309.msg1475036#msg1475036">Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The real problem with the current feedback system is that its unacceptable to give a vendor anything below a 5 on a review. That is what taints the system. Its not honest and open. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think this is indeed a big problem with the current system. It started with the very unfortunate choice of words they picked - &quot;Negative&quot; and &quot;Positive.&quot; If anything less than 5/5 is counted as &quot;NEGATIVE&quot; feedback, it only makes sense that a system would evolve that really pressured people to only leave 5/5. If a C-grade experience warrants a 5/5, but an A-grade experience also only warrants a 5/5, and I have to have an F-grade experience to warrant anything else, the system is definitely broken.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200309.msg1475036#msg1475036">Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Any improvement should just be geared to make it so that if a vendor gets a single 1/5 it does not blow up their entire score. That way, if some buyer threatened to change their feedback a month later, it wouldn&#039;t be such a massive fucking deal if they did. One 1/5 out of 500 transactions can be seen as an outlier to any intelligent buyer. Unless it brings down a sells ranking so drastically.... That system just doesn&#039;t make sense<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again I agree. As it is right now, I have no idea how they calculate how much a 4/5 brings you down, but it is a LOT!!! From my rough math, I will need about a hundred 5/5s of the same value to &quot;get rid of&quot; the negative effects of a 4/5. Vendor JacknHoff had a similar issue where a couple stray feedback among hundreds have brought him down to like 4.0/5. Is the actual AVERAGE of his feedback 4/5? Hell no, but some weird mathematical formula that gives WAY too much weight to &quot;negative feedback,&quot; makes him look like a shitty vendor. While this is still the case, it only makes sense that vendors will still be heavily encouraging leaving 5/5 feedback. I can tell you right now if I get a 4/5 feedback from someone in the current system they will have to be at the very least personally blacklisted.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200309.msg1475036#msg1475036">Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Until the feedback system exists so that I don&#039;t have to give out a 5. It is broken. When I can give a 3/5 because the vendor sold me okay weed, packaged in something not so stealthy that stank, and came a week late, the system is broken. Right now I would have to give that person a 5 and just type that stuff out.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree. I think you&#039;re on the right track. I honestly think the answer is two fold: One, Buyer Feedback. Vendors need to be able to see this. Two, &quot;negative feedback&quot; (anything less than 5/5) should not count so heavily!<br /><br />Personally, I think if I have 99 5/5 reviews and one 3/5 review my average should be 4.98/5!!! That just makes simple mathematical sense. As it stands right now your average would be more likely to be way lower depending on a slew of variables no one really understands and is ultimately terrified of. If 99 5/5 reviews and one 3/5 review can drop my rating by 0.20 instead of by 0.02, I think there is a problem. <br /><br />The only real argument I can see for not making negative feedback have less impact is that &quot;oh well but then scamming vendors wont be as easy to pick out early.&quot; And I think that&#039;s pretty much a non-point. AFAIK the vast majority of scamming vendors have near perfect feedback when they run their scam anyway - see Planet Express for example.

				ok, it&#039;s working as designed, but maybe the design needs improvement.&nbsp; As I&#039;ve said before, the review weight is a combination of 3 factors: age (how long ago it was left), size of the transaction being reviewed, and the weight of the buyer.&nbsp; The weight of the buyer depends on two factors: how much they&#039;ve spent on SR, and the weight of the vendors they&#039;ve bought from.&nbsp; The weight of the vendors depends on two factors: how much buyers have spent on their items, and how recent each purchase was.<br /><br />With that in mind, the two 1 of 5 ratings and the one 2 of 5 rating outweigh the 111 5 of 5 ratings by a factor of 10.&nbsp; This is because the low ratings are for large transactions by highly rated buyers and the high ratings are for small amounts from low weight buyers.<br /><br />We are still working on features to help you drill down into the ratings and see why vendors are rated the way they are, which should help make situations like this more clear.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to look into tweaking the weights as well.&nbsp; Maybe instead of the weight rising linearly with each factor, it can rise logarithmically.

Not so many buyers active in this thread. Maybe that&#039;s because the vendors in general are more active in the forums than the buyers? Or maybe the buyers don&#039;t care so much, just as long as &quot;the spice flows&quot;? Or maybe this really is hurting the vendors so much that they feel the need to come out more loudly?<br /><br />The example above might seem to be a bit unfair. However, I think it is still a step in the right direction, just maybe needs some adjustments.<br /><br />For me as a buyer, those numbers are totally relevant. I want to know where the feedback comes from. A vendor with stats like these seems to have a serious problem if all their large transactions are so fucked up that they get 1:s and 2:s from them. Maybe they are even selectively scamming? I want to see these kind of issues reflected in their stats. If all the feedback would have equal weight, then a vendor like in the example would seem to be really legit, even though every time they send out a large order they have serious problems with it. For me this is especially important, as I don&#039;t buy personal amounts, only bulk. I really want to know how a vendor handles serious transactions. It is so much easier to ship a g of coke succesfully, than say 250g:s of MDMA.<br /><br />This also almost totally solves the problem of feedback padding, and the problem many see with lotteries and such (of which Miss Bliss was worried about also if I recall correctly? Hmm I think her issue had a different, very valid point though...). Manufacturing fake feedback will be very very costly, if the weighting is anywhere like this.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m not saying sbraser is a scammer or anything like it! I have no history with this vendor what so ever.<br /><br />His poor stats could, on the other hand, be a result of another problem with the system: Extortion from buyers with very good stats. If a vendor mostly has small listings, and then someone with very good stats claims a non-arrival of a large order and leaves 1/5, a vendor will be royally fucked. A quote from sbrasers vendor page:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">*** my last feedback<br />1 of 5 no package<br />was an international shipping, i proposed for a 50% refund (against my rules), but this guy claimed for a 100% refund.<br />***</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course, this is also not good at all. In any case, sbrasers rating seems to bit &quot;a bit&quot; unfair, and something clearly needs to be done here.<br /><br />All in all, I think there are good things happening here, and I&#039;m sure DPR and the team will figure out the right balance with the weighting and everything. Maybe the buyers high rate should not be weighed as much? Or maybe the size of the order should not weight as much? I dunno, but I do know that I, as a buyer, want to see larger transactions effect the vendor rating more than smaller ones.<br /><br />And I would really like to see a clickable sorting for 1-5 ratings, so I could use my own judgement to evaluate the feedback of a vendor and decide if they are relevant to me or not.<br /><br />Keep up the good work! I&#039;m sure the right balance will be found!<br /><br />Lots of love to you all!

				Just throwing out an idea there :<br /><br />If the 1 to 5 rating bars could be a little more detailled (for example by clicking on it or something in that style), wouldn&#039;t it be possible to make something that looks like that ?<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;420 ratings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$20 avg. purchase<br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 ratings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $150 avg. purchase<br />3<br />2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 ratings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $200 avg. purchase<br />1<br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br />This way an interested buyer could more precisely have an estimated success rate for the price range of the listing he is looking for, and the general score would be more easily understood (and won&#039;t hurt as much in cases like sbraser&#039;s one).<br /><br />Because that may be just me, but I don&#039;t really care if a vendor has a lower average rating than normal that seems due to him having problems dealing with big orders if I am looking for a small listing. And the other way around, I don&#039;t care if a vendor has a very high success rate with small listings if I am looking to buy bulk.<br /><br /><br />Edit: Yeah, the clickable rating numbers linking to the feedbacks left with that rating would be an even nicer addition to this.

The vendor would have to go above and beyond to get the last 10% such as sending freebies or next day shipping or just being awesome in some other way. <br /><br />Also, I like the idea of being able to click on each individual rating (1,2,3,4, or 5...unless it went to 10, of course) to see all feedback that was given that rating.

				hi hi <br /><br />@love inc:&nbsp; i think there has been plenty of buyers in this thread voicing their opinions, mostly positive on the feedback system changes. and i believe you are correct in your summation that vendors are generally negative on this. personally, the rating system has worked out well for me SPECIFICALLY, as with the x/100 system i was at like 98.x%, and now i&#039;m a straight 5 star.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />what i take most offense to, is the ability for random anonymous strangers of which i have had no prior transactions being able to leave &quot;feedback&quot; in the form of a discussion comment on my vendor profile, item listing, or general category. i do not feel that it is fair to force me into stealth mode and lose my position on the category to &quot;disable&quot; discussions. again, of which i have been lucky to not have to deal with yet.<br /><br />i also feel the 5star system does not address the main crux of the problem which as was pointed out earlier is mostly societal - and can not be easily remedied. <br /><br /><br />you had mentioned i had qualms with lotteries (as they exist now), and you would be correct. to that end, i have posted awhile ago in the feature request forum what i felt to be a suitable solution to the lottery &quot;problem&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;the short story on that is a separate &quot;type&quot; of listing that would be just used for lotteries. please see that thread for more information on what i proposed. i believe it would fix all aspects people have about lotteries, and overall improve user experience for those who wish to gamble. <br /><br /><br />sadly, the only real counter we vendors seem to have to feedback extortion is the blacklist, and that continues the nasty cycle of &quot;you must leave 5/5 or be shunned&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;ve already said my peace on this, and feel feedback should be locked, which would allow me to vend to newbies and veterans alike without the fear that they will at some point weeks later decide to try and hold feedback over my head for a discount/free drugs. we&#039;ll see how DPR wants to move forward with it, as it is his website and he is the boss.<br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb

				READY FOR THE WRENCH?<br /><br />Ok so here is my issue... I think that some real scammers could come in here open a vendor account and generate false feedback. How you ask? You would be paying a small fee to SR for your transactions from one of your buyer accounts to one of your seller accounts.... This would in turn be you paying for your feedback to be bosted.<br /><br />Once you have reached an amount of feedback needed to start requesting FE&#039;s ( I know I know don&#039;t FE.... same story when they told me not to do drugs cause they are bad for me... where did that get me???) and you in turn get them... enough so you make your money back and then some. Is this a hard operation? Yes. Does it require some of your money upfront? Yes. Is it worth your time and effort? Depends on who it is because I see some sellers showing 1-5&#039;s and no sign of these in the feedback provided for that item.<br /><br />As a buyer I don&#039;t know how to make a purchase because the guy I want to buy from has been here less then two months... this in turn has me not making a purchase because I don&#039;t know if it in fact is true feedback or false. I think the feedback should be a much more complex system on my end.<br /><br />I think you should have more security measures to make sure a true buyer is placing that feedback... If you do infact FE you do not get any feedback at all for that transaction. This again is just what I think should be done but if you mix what I am saying in with what some of you have come up with I think we could all be happy.<br /><br />In the end all I am saying is some of you smuts are inflating your feedback....&nbsp; ::)

If you do not FE then you have none of the risk you talk about here. I mean that is the whole point of escrow!!!!<br /><br />And your analogy of getting people not to finalize is like being told not to do drugs is really not even close to accurate. Meaning it is a terrible analogy. I get what you are trying to say...that no matter how many times we warn &quot;them&quot; they will still FE. BUT...the facts are that most people do not FE. And that the scams that vendors pull with the FE option is actually not that big a number at all. Now of course I wish it was zero. But that is never going to happen. Sure YOU can not control the other morons who FE...but you can control you...and you can totally buy from this vendor and have nothing to worry about at all if you do not FE.<br /><br />Also...as to your theory of fake feedback....it of course happens...but again...fake feedback is hard to do. Sure you can do a few...but if you just pay a little more attention as a buyer you could easily spot it. And fake feedback has never been a real issue here. In the forums you have some people ..like your self...that totally over value fake feedback and they believe that it is something that happens a lot more then it does...or they believe it is easy to do and is worth the time to do it. You actually address those issues...but the one thing you left off is that fake feedback is actually really a waste of time for a vendor and that is why it does not happen that often. <br /><br />I have no idea if you are&nbsp; a new buyer or just someone that is overly cautious....but the fact is if you just use the simple guide line of not FE&#039;ing ever....you will pretty much eliminate any chance of getting scammed. You would also find that this is not at all how vendors scam here. They do not do it offering items for sale or with&nbsp; new accounts. They almost always involve BTC. And the accounts that end up scamming the people here are in fact accounts that are totally legit..no fake feedback at all...ever...and actually are model vendors...then when they want&nbsp; to leave......they start asking people to FE....and they blindside long time customers. That is what you have to look out for ...just giving you the real facts.

				Just wanted to reiterate, as a buyer, I like to see the amount of &quot;fans&quot; a vendor has...and compare this to total transactions and their longevity on SR.&nbsp; This is a quick way for me to ascertain if the vendor is popular and is satisfying his or her clients.&nbsp; &nbsp;This statistic is now missing altogether from the vendor profile page.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I also concur with some folks above that if we are rating on a 1 to 5 scale...we really need to define what it takes to earn a 5.&nbsp; &nbsp; What it takes and what criteria should be met to earn a 4, etc. etc. etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a buyer, if I get my gear on time, and the stealth is adequate, and the quality is better than average (or sometimes even just average) I still feel obligated to leave a 5 out of 5.&nbsp; &nbsp;But should I ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If we have clear definitions for each rating...I think that would help make feedback more meaningful. <br /><br /><br />thnx for everything and for allowing input... 8)

				A thought on feedback refinement from a buyer&#039;s perspective:<br /><br />I&#039;m routinely reading feedback from customers rating no-shows. I&#039;ve had this situation myself and was not really sure how to express my best judgement. Sure, the vendor&#039;s communication might be one factor in this process but without any product, ratings are pretty meaningless. How should I say anything about the transaction and the product quality if I never received anything? There are many 5/5 ratings for no-shows and I believe buyers should have another option - at least after the order went into the resolution phase.<br /><br />I would very much welcome to know a vendor&#039;s success rate. I think it&#039;s an important performance indicator often missed when talking about vendor feedback. It could be nothing more but a check box disabling the usual feedback controls indicating that transaction rating was not applicable.<br /><br />What are your thoughts about this suggestion?

				I liked the bar graph at first, but after seeing it for a few days I&#039;m starting to dislike it. Maybe you should get rid of the 5/5 section of it since that&#039;s full on everyone&#039;s page and doesn&#039;t really need to be displayed. Just display the 1,2,3,and 4&#039;s so people can focus on the ratings other than 5/5 when looking at vendors. The only thing the bar graph really seems to tell me is that a vendor either has all 5/5&#039;s or 5/5&#039;s with some 1&#039;s or 3&#039;s which you could easily tell just by looking at the number and seeing if it is a 5.0 or 4.9 or 4.8 ect. Just my two bitcoins.&nbsp; :)

				Thanks DPR.<br /><br />The listing for the sample giveaway isn&#039;t stealthed, its purely gone and deleted. I did that days ago, not knowing i needed to keep the sample listing active for that feedback to show. The price of $0 for samples not giving the reviews any weight kinda makes the whole New Vendor Giveaway a dead duck. <br /><br />So, should I try out this new &quot;discussion&quot; thing and see if I can get my sample winners to comment in &quot;my&quot; thread? Or should I do another sample giveaway and then keep that sample listing active afterwards by having the price at 1,000,000 BTC?<br /><br />This sux!<br /><br />SS

We really do need to change the culture from &quot;5/5 is positive feedback, anything less is for scammers and only the worst service.&quot; But you don&#039;t do that with a hope and a prayer. <br /><br />I would do two things here DPR: First, implement a short and sweet helpful guide for people leaving feedback. (At some point it would be nice to have a few categories of feedback, with each being optional and independent of the other. Ex: Stealth, Quality, Communication. Worth noting I think is the side benefit that implementing the three independent categories of feedback would have: it would allow for a &quot;fresh start&quot; in many ways. Unlike retroactively applying a new formula to old feedback, like you have done (this is always going to cause a bunch of complaints for you to look into as I&#039;m sure you experienced), you can leave everyone&#039;s old feedback visible still at the bottom of the listing/profile and begin collecting NEW AND FRESH feedback on Stealth, Quality, and Communication categories from people who actually want to leave a review. In addition, with the guidelines for feedback going into place at the same time, this would in one fell swoop I am certain, be our best chance of instantly changing the culture of &quot;5/5 or DEATH!!! RAWR!&quot;)<br /><br />If you are going to stick with a */5 system, then I would make a guideline for that. Poll the community, do whatever you think is best to come up with it. But put a guideline together that people can look to. Whatever you come up with will have to work better than the current system where 5/5 is left for everything from a D-grade experience to an A+ grade experience and the entire 1/5 to 4/5 range is reserved for D minus grade experiences and below.<br /><br />Quick example guideline blurb: &quot;3/5: Good service. Product arrived successfully and matched description. 4/5: Above Average service that meets or exceeds expectations. 5/5: Superior service in every respect.&quot; or something to that effect. That&#039;s if we don&#039;t expand to multiple categories of feedback, which I would strongly recommend. (Stealth, Quality, Communication)<br /><br />So, after implementing a guide for people leaving feedback (and hopefully splitting the entire feedback system up into three categories), onto the second thing I would do: make it so vendor&#039;s have independent feedback averages for each listing.<br /><br />&nbsp;As many users have mentioned even in the last few pages of posting, it is important to see how a vendor handles bulk vs small vs different KINDS of orders. Shipping weed is very different than shipping some blotter sheets, even high value blotter sheets. I think the answer to this is to show, for each listing, a feedback average. And really, I just keep coming back to the three categories. I want to see the simple average (add the numbers together and divide them man) of all the feedback a vendor has got for a SPECIFIC item he is selling, and I want to know how his Communication, Quality, and Stealth was in regards to that SPECIFIC item. Anything less is selling yourself short. <br /><br />IMO, preferably not a complex formula ;) which I know will pain you to hear DPR. Just a simple average. I too like to tend towards the KISS (keep it simple stupid) methodology, and to me utilizing a simple average rather than a complex one has some clear benefits. <br /><br />Something that would have to be fixed before this got implemented is vendors being able to change their listings to cost $0.01 and then leaving a bunch of feedback on their high dollar items and changing prices back. That could be abused by a simple average system if it wasn&#039;t changed beforehand, but I would just make it so that next to each feedback it showed the total price of the listing in $ or btc or however you&#039;d like to display it. Would make it painfully obvious when then manipulation occurred. Downsides? Potentially showing a look into vendor&#039;s pricing history, but to counter that I would just limit the data to the same time window that feedback has weight for.<br /><br /><br /><br />Quick cliffnotes/reiteration:<br /><br />&nbsp;+ Make guidelines for feedback that are more appropriate than &quot;5/5 for product received, 1/5-4/5 for everything else&quot; so we can leave the current culture behind. Community poll/discussion in order?<br /><br />+ Split feedback into three independent categories: Stealth, Communication, and Quality. <br /><br />+ Make it so every individual listing shows the average feedback rating for each category. Sure the vendor has great product, but how is their stealth? Different things are important to different people. User A may not care about poor stealth if quality is great while User B may be the opposite, and yet User C may not care about Quality so much at all as long as the Communication is excellent and the stealth is good. <br /><br />+ Display the price of the transaction next to the feedback so vendors cant manipulate the system by changing high dollar listings to $0.01 and leaving fake feedback/ratings.<br /><br />+???<br /><br />+Profit

				Also, I think one should be able to see all the feedback one ever left of vendors. I understand if I don&#039;t have the ability to edit it (maybe after 3-4 weeks) but I&#039;d like to see it. That way, if I know I&#039;ve done business with a vendor before, I can look at my feedback and see what I had to say about him/her/them. This would especially be useful to get an ETA of the package. Additionally, when I do reviews for vendors on the forums, I provide a link in the feedback on SR. If I ever wanted to look at past reviews, I could easily just go to my feedback page and have all the links right there. <br /><br />I can see how some people might want no record of their purchasing history available anywhere. To this I say make it an option for the user to enable/disable like the incognito feature. For bonus points, give the user options like &quot;never keep any feedback&quot;, &quot;keep feedback for 3 months&quot;, &quot;keep feedback for 1 year&quot;, and &quot;keep feedback forever&quot;. That&#039;d be awesome!

				I&#039;m in a total rush right now but, I&#039;ll try to point some of my thoughts as best I can with one foot out the door. (And if some of these were brought up I&#039;m apologize as I only read through a few pages, rush, one foot out the door. Sorry!)<br /><br />Feed back system, on 2 columns would be great! The good and the bad so buyers can read both on the same page. As you mentioned early on , the higher quality review would swing up top (or make a like system so that the one with most attention and buyers agree on would float to the top) This to be worked also with the bad reviews.. Also the point system as one member mentioned is another thing that I found useless and couldn&#039;t base anything from it. He brought an idea, which woulld be helpful and to have each category it&#039;s own 1-5 score card and the buyers would choose each one 1-5 would click the score per category of what their experience was with the vendor and the final will deter main it&#039;s rating...A pro&#039;s and con&#039;s option would work well I think along with a &quot;other comments&quot; for buyers who need to share a little more. The feed back system we have no is completely useless, for one vendors tend to try and force a 5/5 score which makes the overall feed back system have no value at all. A score for each category<br /><br />1. Customer service - 1 5 stars system or 1-5<br /><br />2. Processing and shipping - This to be followed by a number system from 1-5 but also have 2 separate boxes to fill in the times of each (This is something buyers can use to judge or get an idea if a order placed will he /she be able to get it on this date. I found myself in a couple situations that I could of use info like this instead having to wait for the vendor to reply hours later to find out it can&#039;t be done or it&#039;s to late.) and the boxes are for the buyers overseas to also get the burning question answered.<br /><br />3. Stealth - 1-5 point system but I want to mention and this is for new vendors that I&#039;ve made a couple orders with and while expressing my concerns and wonder how it made it through a response was never replied from the vendor till weeks later and what pissed me off was the excuse of trying to save cost on stamps and shipping material..........This is found to be very troubling and careless and selfish on the vendors part and this I believe should be more strict on with and if a buyer gives a low score on it&#039;s stealth a box giving the buyer to express his/her concerns on what the problem was only to be seen by the vendor of course AND THE STEALTH SCORE TO BE IN BIG BOLD BRIGHT LETTERS to advise a warning that it&#039;s not safe till the vendor understands and agree&#039;s with the buyer. To bring it back to normal.<br /><br />4. Quality of product - 1-5 points<br /><br /><br />5.&nbsp; Over all experience, will buyer be back 1-5.<br /><br />A pro&#039;s and con&#039;s box? <br /><br />6. Other thoughts <br /><br />One more thing, a display of the buyers tolerance or experience level on what was purchased. with the fair amount of people here doing the choice of drug for a short period of time would almost always say the product was the best..to only be with a product was decent for an experienced user. The boards do help on this matter as new users do state their tolerance and the experience users only look for specific reviews from from specific users because of the level difference.<br /><br />Also an idea, to be brought to another page when clicking on the order number with all the details on the order but also options to leave the feed back,&nbsp; PM&#039;s to the vendor or continue on pervious messages share back and forth, to being linked or having the discussion of the vendor shown on that page also. I can see this might take up some space but to show only show the important few and link to point the person in the right direction to read more would help people find things quicker.<br /><br />I tried to put into much detail as possible with the amount of time I have but shoes are starting to fly at my head and I got&#039;s to go. <br /><br />Nice job so far DPR and the crew! Keep up the hard work and hopefully by the end we&#039;ll all have something that will have everyone happy..Which life has taught me is impossible. :)

				This may have already been proposed, as this is a very long thread. In addition to Tess&#039; idea, perhaps down the road the ratings can be split in some way between buying experience and product quality. The buying experience would be what is displayed for the vendor (as it already is), and the product quality could be attached to individual listings. The listings themselves could then build up their own reputation based on quality. New listings would have zero reputation, of course, but from what I can tell a lot of vendors use the same listings again and again.

				Very disappointed I cannot see the most recent feedback on my vendor page anymore.<br /><br />I see i can go to another page and resort it to get what MAY be my latest feedback. Breaking a freshness sort into sub-categories, makes it not a freshness sort. I have only gotten less than 5/5 once and that was an accident (which, if it ever happens again, can&#039;t be repaired - another disappointment). So, the freshness sort works for us at the moment. The new text on the 5-point scale encouraging buyers to give less than a 5/5 (another disappointment) makes the sub-categorized &quot;freshness sort&quot; less likely to be useful when people want to know what has been happening most recently.<br /><br />A 4/5 rating is a huge minus (-20%). If you want people to be able to give less than a 5/5 for small vendor disappointments, the scale should be 10/10 or 100/100. And, we probably need hundredths 0.00 rather than just tenths 0.0 if we are to be well informed. I know this is a complex update with a lot of issues to consider. I think the current &quot;build&quot; needs a lot of work to be as good as the old system. I do appreciate the big effort going into trying to make things even better all the time :-)

				I agree there are many situations where a buyer needs to edit feedback. I propose the solution: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyers should only be able to edit there most recent transaction with a vendor. This would prevent feedback blackmail while still allowing a buyer to adjust the latest feedback. (After all the fact a buyer has ordered again shows they were happy with the previous transactions.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for the rest of the new system, I have to admit I preferred the old system, but maybe that is just familiarity.

				If so, perhaps someone can explain why almost every top 20 vendor has seen drops and has a stream of complaints...<br /><br />Fine to make life easy for customers...but without a product you have no SR...and vendors need to feel this is working for them too.

				This feedback system is extremely buggy. I&#039;ve seen it display the values as &#039;a&#039; &#039;b&#039; &#039;c&#039; repeatedly. It also makes no sense to put old feedback on the front of your profile page. I don&#039;t even sell most of those items anymore and haven&#039;t for quite some time. Sales have DEFINITELY dropped to almost nothing. Also, if you go to view feedback in account, the new feedback does not show. You can only see it if you go through it on your profile and sub page and then half the usernames are &quot;alias hidden&quot; and half of them show, which is a security risk for the buyers. This is just a major major MAJOR fail. The old system had its flaws but this is just terrible. It&#039;s like replacing Facebook with Myspace. This is a downgrade. Really I applaud the effort and in theory it seemed good, but it is not working. <br /><br />DPR: If you aren&#039;t aware, take a peek at the Roundtable section and you can see how many problems this is causing.

				yes, a peek in the roundtable section is definitely warranted! <br />i applaud the effort and attempt but, there seems to be lots of issues all around, especially from the vendor&#039;s point of view. rollback to what we had for now, and take on board all the thousands of points made over the past week then incorporate the good ones into a silkroad v.2.<br />its not the kind of site to roll out changes like this, and then try test for bugs after. <br />

				It&#039;s been a few days now.. And i have to agree that there is definately a disconnect going on now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve began planning my next purchase, but viewing the main vendor page is pretty well useless as far as knowing whats going on over the last few weeks.<br /><br />Specially when your dealing with weed, we all know most of the weed vendors are buying their weed from Uncle bob, cousin sally, and Joseph down the street.&nbsp; All of the vendor&#039;s sources may well have Purple Kush, but all the sources will also be of slightly different in quality.&nbsp; I.e.<br /><br />Which means when I look for 1 lb of Purple Kush, I&#039;ll see review&#039;s at random of purchase made over time and from many different batches.&nbsp; I now don&#039;t have a clue what to feel about those reviews...<br /><br />So instead what I do is shoot my preferred Vendor&#039;s an message and ask them... Which isn&#039;t a bad thing, if your preferred vendor&#039;s are good dudes, who shoot straight (which i believe mine are :P). But lets be honest... A lot of vendors will swear up and down that their shit is better then anyone&#039;s while at the same time talking shit about his compititors (rude dudes).&nbsp; hmmmm. What i&#039;m trying to say the feedback review system has just become almost useless to me.<br /><br />And the Time/review/information disconnect, makes me very uneasy, especially if your dealing with a newer or unestablished vendor.

				One more thing to add.&nbsp; It is better now that they are chronological, but it is really awkward having the 5/5, 4/5, 3/5, 2/5, and 1/5 reviews all sorted in separate lists.&nbsp; Now, while there is some value to being able to get a list of each number, for instance if you want to check all the 1/5 reviews without scrolling back many pages, I don&#039;t think this should be the default view.<br /><br />The default view should be sorted chronologically first (ratings 1-5 mixed together in chronological order), and at the top of this list, it can say something like<br />[all]&nbsp; &nbsp;[5]&nbsp; [4]&nbsp; [3]&nbsp; [2]&nbsp; [1]<br />which would be clickable links for which ratings to show.&nbsp; [all] would be the default so you would see all the ratings regardless of number, and then if there were no low ratings recently it would not be on the first page, but this is reasonable because older low ratings may be not relevant anymore.&nbsp; But, for a user that wanted to be safe, they can click on the 1 to doublecheck.&nbsp; In fact, the links for the specific rating can have the number of ratings total in parenthesis, such as:<br />all(5847)&nbsp; 5(5800)&nbsp; &nbsp;4(40)&nbsp; 3(0)&nbsp; 2(0)&nbsp; 1(7)<br />so that users won&#039;t waste their time checking the 1 ratings if there are none, for example.

				Sorry if this has already been suggested, but:<br /><br />It would be nice to be able to alter the sort order of feedback.<br />The ability to sort by newest, even if default is the new &quot;feedback from highly rated buyers first&quot;.<br />If I suspect a seller is now sending out poor quality product, yet they have an impeccable reputation from the past, it would be good to see what other people are saying right now about the product that&#039;s being sent out, without having to go through every page and look at the age of each entry.

				Maybe buyers can see their own feedback by clicking &quot;Account&quot; and then &quot;Recent orders&quot;. That does not work for vendors anymore. They stripped out the feedback. (ruined it)<br /><br />Also, the &quot;Freshness&quot; sort on my vendor page only shows transactions where the buyer left feedback. So, it appears I have very few recent sales. Very offputting to potential new buyers. Seeing all recent transactions is crucial to being able to check out a vendor. Please bring that functionality back soon, we need it badly.

I agree the Poll was set up in a biased way, but, I think an unbiased one would get very similar results. I don&#039;t think this update was good for buyers and bad for vendors as some seem to imply when dismissing vendor concerns.<br />There are great parts and ideas in the update. It just seems to me that it has problems which overshadow the good for both buyers and sellers so far. I have high hopes that we will get a lot of good from this effort in the long run. I just wish I did not feel so scared of the current dangers that I agree I should be going into stealth-mode while I wait for that great future day.

ST is the biggest scammer on here and SR need to ban this fool. Its a shame idiots like him get to carry on scamming people. As for trippynation, Notice his 25G listing as dissapeared! You know why don&#039;t you, Cause my feedback exposed him!<br /><br />You learn all this in time and its apart of this business but eventually we hope we can clean the scum out of this industry and have it with smart, reputable people that can move things forward instead of just been selfish pricks! We can all dream&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Peace &amp; GL to all<br /><br />P.S - Were buyer&#039;s as well as been a seller, Here are our stats without including other &#039;buying&#039; accounts<br /><br />1 month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all time<br />total transactions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95<br />total spent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£1,550.40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£3,847.90 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£9,510.40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£17,962.00<br />total vendors &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57<br />refund rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />auto-finalize rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5%<br /><br />So as you can see..... we don&#039;t mess around. We also care about the small person as much as the big dude! Everyone&#039;s equal when it comes to dealing with us and we do our best to make this community a better thriving one. We welcome competition as it&#039;s all a win win situation and there enough business for everyone in this new world of free markets. This was another reason why we were so disappointed in TrippyNation, Shame really but he showed his true colors by the end. <br /><br />people change there spots when it comes to the crunch, Be aware of imitators!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />generalsalms quite your shit.&nbsp; We still have your address if you want to cause any more shit. Remove this thread or we will take action.&nbsp; You are a scam artist.&nbsp; You want free drugs. ABUSE the refund system and and just want to make mega bucks from your 2cb caps whilst everyone loves our 2cb powder.&nbsp; Just leave us alone and let us run business if you want to make loads of money go suck old mens dick.&nbsp; I am sick of people like you ruining the community.&nbsp; Ruining DPR&#039;s wonderful system and how everything runs.&nbsp; You want to get ruined. How about we have a little chat to him.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />-1 to TrippyNation for saying he still has an address...and threatening to use it

Saying:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The new feedback system is going through growing pains, no doubt.&nbsp; But you can&#039;t deny the usefulness regarding obvious FE scammers like KetamineOcean that just racked up 50+ &quot;beware of scammer&quot; feedbacks before his inevitable vendor demotion.&nbsp; While I&#039;m sure he got some newbie FE money, it was caught far sooner than under the old system.&quot;,<br />suggested you were referring to the &quot;feedback system&quot; that I think makes evaluating scammers more difficult. I actually tried to see if a vendor was legit today. No way to tell since most transactions appear to be hidden now. He had some nice feedbacks, but only a few. He had done some gambling game and it gave him a lot of transactions in the past. No way to tell if his account had current transactions. So, I did not order from him.<br />Sorry to get on you personally, I&#039;m just sensitive about the real &quot;feedback system&quot; these days. I should have realized people who say it is great could easily be referring to something else.

				I think the new rating system is fine except for one thing - if I choose not to leave feedback I should be able to leave feedback later. The way it is now forces me to choose between finalizing as quickly as I can versus providing a rating after I have had a chance to try the product.<br /><br />When I receive the package I finalize. Period. If I don&#039;t like the product or it is light I will work with the vendor to resolve it. My primary reaction to bad vendors is that they go on my private blacklist - I don&#039;t buy from them anymore. I would, in the past, change my ratings based on the interactions with the vendor as well as to provide updates on the quality of the product which I often haven&#039;t tried before I finalize.<br /><br />So I just made my first order under the new rating system and I said &quot;Don&#039;t rate&quot; thinking I could go back and provide a rating when I tried the product. But I couldn&#039;t. The two vendors probably deserve 5&#039;s due to their incredibly fast service but until I had a chance to examine the products I didn&#039;t want to do that.<br /><br />But my issue is that I want to finalize so they get their money. The way the rating system works now forces me not to finalize quickly in order to be in able to provide a review based on facts.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think this is good for vendors. And I don&#039;t like not leaving reviews in order to finalize ASAP.

				I think you don&#039;t fully understand how the new system works electriccrazyman.<br />If you wanted to wait before rating/leaving feedback, well you just had to do so.<br /><br />Once you click finalize, vendors get their coins, and after that you have all the time you want to leave a rating or a feedback.<br />The &quot;I don&#039;t want to rate this seller&quot; is here precisely for what it says, which is if you don&#039;t want to rate the seller, be it now or later.<br /><br />Also on this issue the following quote from the orders page is quite clear I believe :<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">* DO NOT leave a rating if you are still waiting on your order!<br />** All ratings are final.

				i&#039;m very peeved that customers can&#039;t update their feedback anymore. this is nonsense. i&#039;ve been several hundred user&#039;s first vendor on SR, and so believe me when i say that people accidentally put negative ratings not realizing how the system works. this also takes away incentive for fixing issues. if someone leaves a 1/5 because of USPS&#039;s mistake, it&#039;s going to stay a 1/5 even if i reship it for them. not fair.<br /><br />how many customers are really going to wait another five days or so before announcing their frustration anyways? if a customer wants to leave a temporary feedback about how their order&#039;s progress is going, i think that&#039;s fine. the previous feedback system has worked great for this for thousands of orders. now i foresee my 11 negative feedbacks over the past 8 months probably doubling or tippling in number within the next 2 months because of USPS fuck-ups.<br /><br />also as a buyer, i don&#039;t order things when i&#039;m ready to use them. i order them way in advance. so why should the vendor be withheld from my positive feedback in the meantime? i should be able to announce successful arrival, and then later announce how much i liked the product.<br /><br />i&#039;m also not excited about the idea of buyer&#039;s feedback being anonymous. i should have the ability to know who leaves me negative feedback. some new customers are under the impression that their negative feedback shows up in my inbox. one customer even got irate with me when i told him that he never msged me about his problem. BTW thank you DPR for giving us the recent orders page back.<br /><br />i want the feedback system to go back to exactly how it was a month ago.<br /><br />as for improvements to the feedback system, i&#039;m sure that all of the veteran vendors would agree with me on these:<br /><br />1) let my buyers update their feedback.<br /><br />2) if i issue someone a full refund at my own expense there better be no way in hell that they have the ability to leave me negative feedback.<br /><br />3) i need to ability to leave my own comment about someone&#039;s negative feedback.<br /><br />4) i would love to have the ability to challenge negative feedback and have it removed from my profile if the user disappears and never even gives me a chance to address the issue. many people people won&#039;t respond to my msgs and i&#039;m assuming most of them are accounts that got hijacked, they forgot their password, they changed their username, or they&#039;re just not even a part of the SR community anymore.<br /><br />5) i like FuzzzyYak&#039;s idea to have a private Trusted list. i would love to reserve special deals for users that already have an established reputation with me. or better yet, i would love to have a higher price for newcomers, and have a series of tiers that customers can earn their way into to get better prices.<br /><br />6) correct me if i&#039;m wrong, but there needs to be a way to see how many disputes with reships a user has initiated.<br /><br />as for the new 4/5 feedback standard... i don&#039;t care what it says when they click on the 4/5 option, i&#039;m still going to warn every user that i&#039;m going to sever my business relationship with them if they leave anything less then a 5/5.

The pressure on buyers to give 5/5 is so great that it detracts from its value.<br /><br />When I look at reviews, I am less interested in the 5/5 ratings than knowing the likely worst case scenario. I want to see what happened when something went wrong, and how the vendor handled it. For example, if vendors get 3/5 or 4/5 because the product took longer than expected, then if I am not in a hurry it&#039;s not a problem for me. Again, if a lower rating is given just because that product is not exactly as described (eg colour or crystal size), this is unlikely to affect my decision as to whether to buy. With the new feedback system it is the discussion feature which I turn to first, and then the forum posts.<br /><br />I don&#039;t expect vendors to be perfect, but neither do I expect buyers&#039; ratings and reviews to be 100% accurate.<br /><br />Since the new feedback system came in I have not given any ratings yet because it is not possible for me to relay feedback on product quality for a month or so. (Note the word &quot;relay&quot;.) Fortunately the discussion feature does allow me to comment on delivery stealth and packaging. For the record all the ratings I have given have been 5/5, and I am grateful for the excellent service my SR vendors have provided. However faced with an option to leave 5/5 or else be banned from using that&nbsp; vendor again, I would buy from another vendor or do without.

				Under the new feedback system, a rating can drop dramatically. For example just one rating of 3/5 could pull a perfect 5 down below 4 easily.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s time users perception of good vendors changed as although a perfect 5 is good, a 4/5 could still indicate an excellent vendor.<br /><br />Just be wary of the 1/5 or 2/5 vendor. This is the benefit of the new system. With the old feedback, buyers had to actually read through pretty much ALL the feedback to get a good picture of them as even a 97-98 could have signifcant issues.

				We need eBay style category-specific ratings, e.g. 1 -5 stars for comms, 1 - 5 stars for speed of delivery, 1- 5 stars for packaging, 1 - 5 stars for product.<br /><br />That way, a buyer would feel no guilt in giving a 4/5 for comms, because they gave a 5/5 in all the other categories. To the buyer it feels like giving genuine feedback and helping the seller to be even better, while giving praise at the same time.<br /><br />It would be important to not make the mistake of presenting and combining the above into an overall single-number score though, as that would completely undo the core principle of the system. Just average out everybody&#039;s ratings in each category and display the average star-ratings for each category (including half-lit stars so that the overall average for each category is on a 1 - 10 scale).

				In many cases I dont even know if buyer left feedback or not simply because I have no idea where the feedback is hiding . &quot; Freshness &quot; make no sense to me.<br />Anyway ...I guess I have to go back to school to be able to figure out those math equations we have been given....:)<br /><br />Good luck to you all&nbsp; <br /><br />

				OK how about this idea:<br /><br />DPR re-winds to before the feedback system change, and freezes those scores that vendors had then and displays that as the seller&#039;s &quot;Legacy Feedback Score:&quot;<br />Each seller also has a second feedback rating - their score from feedback under the new scheme - their &quot;New Feedback System Score:&quot;<br /><br />Then it&#039;s a level playing field going forwards, and no one feels their old hard earned feedback is being wiped out.

				Never mind.......I guess I just have to get used to it somehow...... I just found 2 more ratings below 5&nbsp; :(<br />I am&nbsp; 100 % sure that those 2 were given by mistake too.....How do I know ?<br /><br />No one gives 1/5 while going into details how much he loved my product.....<br /><br />Anyway ....I am sure this new feedback system is here to stay ..(with its funny math equations :)...we like it or not<br /><br /><br />Best of luck&nbsp; to you all to clean up the mess you might have<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
