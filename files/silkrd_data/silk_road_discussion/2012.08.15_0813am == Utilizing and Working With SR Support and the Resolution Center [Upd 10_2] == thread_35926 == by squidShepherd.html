				UPDATE: PIN reset period is now 3 days instead of 1 week!<br /><br /><br />Utilizing and Working With SR Support and the Resolution Center<br />A Guide<br /><br />This guide is intended to cut down on the number of messages sent to Support by telling you what information they&#039;ll need to solve any problems, and what problems they can&#039;t solve.<br /><br />Post any questions, I&#039;ll update this post.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Infamous PIN<br /><br />Support gets more PIN related messages than anything else. They&#039;d get half as many of these or less if everyone understood the reset process a little better.<br />1. Enter 5 incorrect PINs to lock it. At this point an automated message will be sent to you by Support, notifying you to reply &quot;in 7 days,&quot; meaning after at least 7 days, to have your PIN finally reset. This message is no longer correct, it&#039;s 3 days.<br />2. Wait 3 days. Not 2 days, not 1 day, and certainly not 5 minutes. Feel free to wait 5, 14, or 30 days, just make sure it&#039;s 3+.<br />3. Reply and wait for new message telling you to log out and in.<br />4. Log in and set new PIN.<br /><br />Why does Support make you wait 3 days to have your PIN reset? It&#039;s in case your account has been compromised, and someone else is attempting to empty your wallet. Assuming any identifying information may be compromised with your account, the one thing Support can do is give you some time to find out that someone else locked your PIN and message them that it wasn&#039;t you, before they can take your money.<br /><br /><br /><br />Missing Packages<br /><br />Any issue regarding the pending completion of an order, such as a package not arriving, is referred to as a resolution matter, and can only be fruitfully discussed in the resolution center. Unless the order has been finalized, Support&#039;s response to messages belonging in the RC is &quot;Please refer resolution matters to the resolution center.&quot; Whether you want a refund, or an extension, take the order to the resolution center before it auto-finalizes by clicking &quot;Resolve&quot; next to the order.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve finalized, that&#039;s that. Support can&#039;t get your money from the vendor&#039;s wallet, they lose power when the funds leave escrow. Support gets a number of messages saying &quot;Yeah, this vendor made me FE and now I want a refund cause the order never came and they&#039;re not talking to me now and it&#039;s been like a month.&quot; The answer is invariably some variation of &quot;Sorry, can&#039;t help you with funds released from escrow, talk to the vendor and if they ignore you leave accurate feedback about your bad experience so others can make informed decisions.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Missing Transaction Number<br /><br />&quot;Yeah, this vendor wants to refund me but they need the transaction number and I don&#039;t have my account history anymore, they said to ask you.&quot; Who here sees the flaw here? If you need a transaction record, Support can grab it easily if you just give them 3 key pieces of information - vendor, product, and approximate date of purchase.<br /><br /><br /><br />I/My Buyer Can&#039;t Finalize (Early)<br /><br />Support gets a sad number of messages regarding vendors with under 35 transactions requesting FE. This is not allowed - that is why vendors with under 35 transactions get a 3-day period after shipping before buyers can finalize.<br />New vendors, stop requesting FE. It&#039;s in your contract that you can&#039;t yet.<br /><br /><br /><br />Deposit Won&#039;t Appear<br /><br />Deposits into your SR wallet will typically be fairly quick, but they can sometimes, much less often, process very slowly, taking upwards of 24 hours. So feel free to message Support, but don&#039;t freak out too early. If your coins don&#039;t appear within reasonable time, message Support with the receiving address used on the deposit and how much it was.<br /><br /><br /><br />I Want to Cancel My Order<br /><br />The cancel button becomes available after 4 days of processing, for when a vendor is negligent and fails to ship your order. It is not for backing out of orders because you changed your mind; that&#039;s why it&#039;s not available immediately. If buyers could easily back out of orders, there would be a lot more impulsive order/cancellation pairs, which would disrupt some larger or less organized vendors.<br />Support will not cancel it for you.<br /><br /><br /><br />I Have a Suggestion<br /><br />There&#039;s a section for that here on the forum. If you message Support with it, they advise you to pos it there and provide the url for the subforum.<br /><br /><br /><br />My Refund Was NOT 100%<br /><br />The order was hedged; you were refunded the dollar value you put into escrow, at the exchange rate of the time of refund, resulting in a different number of BTC.<br /><br />But why is that 4% fee taken out even when the vendor just cancels right away?! That&#039;s so not fair!<br /><br />What most people don&#039;t seem to realize is that it&#039;s not a simple fee. It&#039;s a facet of currency conversion - when a hedged order is placed, your BTC are virtually converted to USD. When the order is closed, whether by finalization or resolution or cancellation, those virtual USD are converted back to BTC. Any time you engage in such a conversion, real or virtual, you lose the bid-ask spread. This is usually about 4%.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m Not Getting a Response from RC Staff<br /><br />The RC staff will see your transaction in the center after it comes due, when they get through the transactions before it. If you put a 14 day extension on it, they&#039;ll see it after 14 days, when it&#039;s due again.

				Hopefully this will cut down on the amount of messages to admin., also this should really help a lot on the forums too, if people will just use the search function, instead of a new thread on the same shit everyday. Great Job Shep! :)

				Thanks Squid. I think a lot of these support tickets can be avoided now that this post exists. <br /><br /><br />I have looked for answers to more then a couple of these questions on the wiki to no avail. <br /><br /><br />I sure there aren&#039;t that many trusted admins and I&#039;m sure you guys are crazy busy, but if the wiki was updated with a FAQ section then you may even receive LESS support tickets. <br /><br /><br />E.G. - I never found any documentation anywhere that says vendors can not request FE until 35 transactions. It may exists somewhere but it is not easily accessible. <br /><br /><br />Short of asking for a wiki editor accnt, if I took the time to make a FAQ in wiki format would you entertain seeing that it got put in place on the SR Wiki?<br /><br /><br />PS - I also feel suggestions end up getting mailed to support because there is NO admin presence in the forum. There are some g rest ideas over there and we frankly feel like we are all just speaking amongst ourselves.

				&nbsp;Great post. I am searching through the forums for a possible timeline resolutions get noticed. I made three purchases from a vendor for a single purchase tie in. After trying to get in touch with the vendor(no avail). I even asked him if I should open a resolution to extend. Still no response. The listing I think have been taken down by SR, not sure though. The vendor has BS success rate, good communication, and phony feedback. (doesn&#039;t match the forums) So I had to open three resolutions. First, I just applied for a extension and got no response from the center so I asked forum members what to do. All saying I should just get my coin back.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry if that was unneeded information(same story heard over and over ::) ,being my first and hopefully last resolution conflict, basically what I do want to know is:<br /><br />How long does it take for resolution center to work?&nbsp; I have 3 days until payment is due. Estimates, previous experiences, whatever works, etc.

As a buyer, that is all one could hope for. The Resolution Center, from memory, should send you a generic PM after 10 days have passed since your order was put &quot;in transit&quot; reminding you that if your order hasn&#039;t arrived yet to visit the Resolution Center and submit a proposal to the vendor in question. It will also state that if your package has arrived, to release the funds to the vendor immediately&nbsp; You can choose to either extend the due date for your item&#039;s arrival by adding days on to the due date or request either a percentage of the cost of your product or a full refund. Once chosen, a message is sent to the vendor, where they can either agree to your proposal or submit a different resolution for the buyer to then approve. SR Admin will only step in to resolve a matter when both parties can&#039;t reach an agreement, which from my experience is very rare. Most of the time, extending the due date by 3 - 5 days will solve any problems. If you feel the vendor is trying to rip you off, you&#039;ll need to email SR Admin detailing what has happened and submit any evidence you have to support your claim.<br />In your case, I would send SR Admin any evidence you have which may support your claim and send them a detailed email about what has happened. If you only have 3 days remaining, do it today cause if nothing happens, your BTC will be released to the vendor and an &quot;auto finalized&quot; added to your stats which is to be avoided at all costs. :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Although this is probably nigh-on-impossible to implement, and no longer an issue for me, it would be good for some sort of system to be implemented for UK vendors, who send to UK buyers - we can get our products to customers in less than 24 hours, but then have to wait several days to have the funds released.<br /><br />This might not seen a major issue but in fact caused me to lose several orders, as the money was needed to afford postage early on, and with no way to post orders, some people cancelled (I must mention that they cancelled because it wasn&#039;t posted within 2 days, so was still WAY within the guidelines of Silk Road).<br /><br />Maybe some sort of implementation where if the Vendor has their location set as UK and the buyer has the same, then the finalize limit is set lower ? I have no idea how the coding works here and maybe this is a disproportionately amount of workload for such a minor &quot;gripe&quot;.<br /><br />Would like to add though how amazing a feature the resolution centre is :)

				<br />OK, so it looks like I&#039;m missing something critical here regarding the difference between &quot;SR SUPPORT&quot; and &quot;RESOLUTION CENTER&quot;.<br /><br />I just received a PM from &quot;SR SUPPORT&quot; with a generic subject &quot;checking in&quot; stating:<br /><br />&quot;One or more of your shipments have not been confirmed in over 10 days . Please finalize any shipments that have arrived, or click &quot;resolve&quot; next to the ones that have not arrived. If you do nothing, your payment will be released to your vendor 17 days after your order was shipped.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road staff<br /><br />NOTE: This is an automated message. Please only reply if you need to reach Silk Road support staff.&quot;<br /><br />I thought this was in regards to an issue I am having with a vendor who has not sent me my order and in which I clicked &quot;resolve&quot; with two days left to finalize.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I replied with a copied/pasted string of the messages between the vendor and myself to the automated message in order to find out whats the deal with my &quot;resolution&quot;.&nbsp; I was thinking this was in some way related to helping me resolve this issue.<br /><br />Few hours later I get a reply reaming me for copying/pasting the string of messages between me and the vendor with whom I&#039;m having the issue with.&nbsp; <br /><br />He also stated in the reply that I need to &quot;refer resolution matters to the resolution center, as the staff there have the orders, not me, and they don&#039;t see these messages when they&#039;re working in the RC.<br /><br />~SR Support&quot;<br /><br />Oops, sorry, but I don&#039;t know where nor how to &quot;refer&quot; this matter to the resolution center, since I did click on &quot;RESOLVE&quot; and two weeks later, still no action...<br /><br />Can someone please direct me as to how to finally get this issue &quot;resolved&quot;???<br /><br />Thanks for your patience!<br /><br />Omega Rushmore<br /><br />

				I have a question. I have an old account and I truly do not remember having a pin needing to be entered when I was last on here (over a year ago) and also I notice my stats are erased. When SR did a server move or change whenever that happened is this when pins were introduced and why my past reputation is gone?&nbsp; Did SR always have a pin at checkout? I really do not remember having to enter one.

				I sent a massage to Sr Support about needing my pin reset.<br /><br />They sent me a response... <br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Your PIN has been reset.

				Hey I have posted this already in the Supertrips thread but I thought it couldn&#039;t harm posting my very good experience with SR Support here as well - in case anyone encounters similar problems. <br /><br />OP mentioned that contacting SR Support to cancel orders is not what it&#039;s intended for. <br /><br />First off, I know that it was clearly my fault for not doing research on the vendor in the forums before buying, I just assumed the good reviews on the vendor page are enough (recently started using SR). I ordered from ST, then discovered the forum thread about him and I was almost sure my package wouldn&#039;t come. Obviously I tried to contact him via PM so he could cancel my oder on the main page but wasn&#039;t expecting any replies based on other users&#039; experiences. Anyways, I contacted SR support for 2 reasons - the first one is: ST&#039;s behavior with flagging orders as &quot;in transit&quot; shortly before I was able to cancel seemed shady to say the least - and I knew I wasn&#039;t the only one having that issue. The most important issue though is that he sent me a message saying he couldn&#039;t decrypt my address - so&nbsp; I sent him my address twice again - they were unread at the time he marked it as &quot;in transit&quot;. I don&#039;t think this is the proper way to do business and I believe users should be able to cancel an order if due to unforseen circumstances the delivery will delay as long or the vendor is having other mayor organizational issues. I know he has a reputation and I&#039;m not trying to say he&#039;s a scammer but his MO with delaying order for almost exactly 4 days in processing and flagging stuff as &quot;in transit&quot; when it&#039;s clearly impossible if he can&#039;t read my address. Oh btw. obviously this only applies if you DON&#039;T FE!! Once you FE you can write whoever you want... you&#039;re depending on the good will of your vendor. Luckily I got that part right and did not finalize early.<br /><br />Long story short: I&#039;ve made a very good experience with SR Support. They canceled my order as soon as my message was read (maybe 3 or 4 days after sending) and saved me from having to wait another 10 or so days until I could use the resolution center for a package that wasn&#039;t even sent out. Canceling orders doesn&#039;t only happen if you want to back out of a transaction.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

				With the greatest respect, I realize the need to stop spamming. I know with SMF software fairly well and you could create a separate group for vendors. It seems counter intuitive to make a vendor who spent $150 just to join would still require a 100 posts before the captchas disappear. Note it is not just the posts. Most annoying is when I have to edit my posts for changes of any kind. All modifications require captchas as well and quite honestly, it is IMO both unnecessary and time consuming.<br /><br />Luv ya!<br />Party Girl<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=84794.0

				I have a case with the resolution center for a package that never arrived after a month.&nbsp; I extended the deadline twice and am now applying for a 100% refund.&nbsp; My application pushed the order deadline out another 7 days.&nbsp; I emailed resolution center looking to have my case looked at and resolved ASAP because I want to order elsewhere with my refund but it looks like I&#039;ll have to wait another 6 days until they view and decide on the case? Their reply to my mail led me to here which basically tells me I have to wait until the deadline blows and they get to my case before it&#039;s resolved.<br /><br />I just want my money back to order again as it&#039;s been a over a month since this order was screwed up by the seller!!!<br /><br />W
