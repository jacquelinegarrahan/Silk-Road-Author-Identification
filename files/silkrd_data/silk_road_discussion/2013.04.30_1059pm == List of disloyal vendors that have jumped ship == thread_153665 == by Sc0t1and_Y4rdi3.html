				Listen you scamming idiot, it isn&#039;t called being disloyal.<br />It is called diversification. Do you expect vendors to have their electric and water turned off because they can&#039;t afford the bills due? Do you assume a grow lab operates better without electricity? <br /><br />Nah, you just like to troll and spam, and if you get lucky scam some btc, right?

				Is it really necessary to do that? I&#039;m assuming that these are vendors who&#039;ve moved on to other sites to peddle their wares while SR is down. A lot of people are here for two reasons...1: to make money selling things, and 2: to buy things being sold. If a vendor feels their needs will be met elsewhere(either permanently or just during the downtime), then godspeed to them; you can&#039;t hold other people accountable to the standards you hold yourself to. Calling them traitors does nothing but create an &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality in the community on a subject that doesn&#039;t need it.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

				We have taken a decision to not &quot;jump ship&quot; from Silk Road but putting up vendors who are vending on other sites is stupid. This isn&#039;t a witch hunt. That&#039;s their decision and let&#039;s leave it at that. Theres plenty of us who are around here and you should be able to get whatever drugs you need. Most vendors here have a makeshift operation going and are taking orders. No need to worry about what others are doing. Thats on them!

				The OP is &#039;tarded. <br /><br />Jumping ship would imply that they have resigned and turned in their contract. . . when in fact they have only added more stores to their business to service customers.&nbsp; <br /><br />What a kind of teenage thread is this?

				It is not about loyalty, it is about practicality. You cannot seriously be this naive. When you create huge demand for low cost narcotics; the sellers have to source that and buy in bulk. This is an income for a lot of people, their electricity and water bill does not disappear; they still have to buy food because they&#039;re human beings. To cast blame onto them because they&#039;re not willing (or able) to sit back while their income disappears is really stupid. They will do what is necessary to survive. Please use your brain.

				Ordered from Atlantis yesterday after DPR&#039;s last post that was kind of disheartening.. Quickly marked shipped and the guys pgp key matched what is used on SR so Im not worried.. All this Atlantis has to prove itself, a lot of you wouldnt be here if it wasnt for your local news source spouting off at the mouth about this place.. I will always come back to SR but I have local customer base that expects me to have what I say I have when I say Im going to have it and I cant wait around all day hoping SR comes back up when I need it too.. This is just another market place, I don&#039;t only go to walmart for my food, sometimes I stop at krogers and they dont get butthurt about it..SMDH

				first of all vendors joining atlantis is good for everyone! just means more resources for <br />them if one site goes down! dont get me wrong im an SR guy all the way! i think dpr is the shit <br />and the community is too! but why would it hurt anyone to have more resources. and if your a <br />vendor, while this was going on you were unable to make money or move anything. <br />how is a dealer disloyal for trying to survive?! for buyers they dont have a ton of listings yet <br />but it has definitely grown(about 800 now) and as a buyer its always good to know that if one<br />store goes down, i can shop at another if necc. again sr is the holy grail and i will always love it best!<br />but competition as long as its done without malice is not a bad thing! options are good!<br />

				Haha. If anyone actually READS what DPR posts - he&#039;s all for free market economies. Competition by vendors, and the platforms they choose are a good thing. The whole idea of &quot;loyalty&quot; to DPR and SR is complete bullshit. We vote with our coins. If DPR and Co. manage to lick the DOS problems, then we&#039;ll be back. If he doesn&#039;t, well.. then we&#039;ll move on to Atlantis, or BMR, or wherever. <br /><br />The same goes for the vendor fees actually. Atlantis and BMR have a different fee structure than SR. In the end, it&#039;s the one that will allow the vendors to supply their customers at prices the customers are willing to pay that will win. Libertarianism free market economies at their best, right here. <br /><br />and THAT is what DPR stands for folks. It&#039;s not loyalty to SR, it&#039;s loyalty to the free market that he&#039;s after (I believe). <br /><br />So go on, be free. Visit BMR and Atlantis, and anyplace else that comes along. Competition fosters innovation. Innovators win. Evolve to meet market demands, or die, it&#039;s Darwinism at it&#039;s best. Ultimately, the platform that wins will be the one that provides the best bang-for-the-buck to both the consumers, and the vendors.<br /><br />You&#039;re actually dumb if you AREN&#039;T exploring the other platforms as both a vendor, and a consumer. I placed an order on BMR while SR was down, and found it to be pretty decent. Though the additional escrow for shipping seems sort of stupid and needlessly complicates thing in my eyes. If the market agrees with me, then eventually BMR will do away with it. Atlantis was fast, but didn&#039;t have what I wanted at the time, or I&#039;d have placed a small order there too. <br /><br />
