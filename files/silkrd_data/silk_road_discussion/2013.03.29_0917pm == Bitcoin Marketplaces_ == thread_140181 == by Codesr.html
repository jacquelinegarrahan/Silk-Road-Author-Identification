				I&#039;m looking for bitcoin marketplace sites both on and off of clear net like Bitmit and BMR. Bitmit is the only semi-legit looking clear net site I could find. Anyone use any other bitcoin marketplaces? Thanks!<br />

				Are you talking about market places as in legit goods and service or black market? If it legit services...there is a shit load..if you are talking about places like BMR and SR...then there is only SR...as you know BMR is fucked and the only good people there are the ones that are here.<br /><br />Even by your 2 examples I don&#039;t know what you are looking for...and I assume you are talking about onion sites as you would have to me a moron to not be able to find the legit good sites...and I don&#039;t think you are a moron. :)

I gave an example of a clear net market (Bitmit) and an example of a deep web onion market (BMR). I&#039;m looking for more clear net and onion sites like these. I can find clear net stuff, but nothing that looks legit. Onion sites are more difficult to find. I&#039;m hoping people who have experience with other sites will mention the ones that they know are legit.

				Wow-- I have to say I am a bit shocked that you have put an effort into this and you are having trouble finding places. Also you are not going to find people here that use their coins other places then here. At least not in this forum(meaning silk road discussion) back in the day this post of yours would be moved to the correct forum but&nbsp; it does not matter where you post at nowadays. Though you would think this forum is the most read so just go ahead and type anything in here as many people do....it would actually do you better to ask this question in the correct forum. As you would find people that actually use the btc on other sites in the other forums as they don&#039;t read this forum as it is supposed to be used for only Silk Road discussions. And they have not got he memo yet that this forum is really for any fucking question you could have about anything that has to do with anything..even sometimes Silk road.<br />The Europeans use the BTC for a lot more shit then we do in the states. That will change in the couple of years.<br /><br />So you can start here https://www.spendbitcoins.com/places/<br /><br />Good luck.

				That&#039;s interesting, but I do not need to find places to spend bitcoin. I need to find places where I can sell things for bitcoin.

So you are not getting exposed to new buyers there. This is why you are having so much trouble finding them..they do not exist..though there is a scam going around that a silk road 2.0 will open at the end of April.<br /><br />And though there are certainly honest vendors over there and I am not saying all the SR vendors that are there are scammers...I do know of a few vendors that are in both places..and they are legit here as DPR runs a tight ship and they do not wan to get fucked...they go over there and either selective scam..or totally scam.<br /><br />Sorry I didn&#039;t understand you right away. Good luck.

				Unfortunately most people here have no idea about exchanges, marketplaces and all the other forms of trading btc, all they care about is how to get their next fix as fast as possible.<br />There are factors like fees, speed, security, anonymity that you have to factor in when choosing the right site.
