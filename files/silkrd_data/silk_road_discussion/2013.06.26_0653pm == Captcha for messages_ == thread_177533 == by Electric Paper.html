				Does anyone know why there is now a captcha you need to fill out to send a message? Is it supposed to be there or am I on some kind of a phishing site? It says VB5PIZ3R like normal.....Just wondering

				It&#039;s new and it&#039;s to slow down the spammers and it&#039;s for everyone. It&#039;s no big deal for me, but I feel bad for busy vendors who are sending hundreds of messages.

				Hey Festivalia I really like your avatar pic, I dont know why I get a kick out of it but I do, I never thought that is good hand code if you want to tell a buddy its time to toke up around others that you dont want to know, instead of the ever so obvious putting your fingers to your lips like your toking a roach. more incognito if done sly I bet<br /><br />+1 for the off topic interest for me :-)<br />

				I know it is to fight spammers targeting vendors with loads of BS msgs. That is a cause we all can pitch in towards, effects everyone because t slows down legitimate communication and can easily cause our msgs to be lost in the fog and never replied or read by vendor. That is frustrating and&nbsp; most buyers feel they are being intentionally ignored when they see a vendor has logged in yet still has not read the msg sent to them 2 days ago.<br />&nbsp;

				it would, however, be nice if SR used the simple 3 number or similar short captcha&#039;s like BMR does assumed they are still as effective of course&nbsp;
