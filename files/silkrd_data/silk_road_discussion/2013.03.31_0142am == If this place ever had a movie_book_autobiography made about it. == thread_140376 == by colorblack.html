				How fucking cool would that be? Just thinking outloud. I read once DPR hinted at writing his memoirs one day. Although I&#039;m all about&nbsp; &quot;pirating&quot; my movies/books/music.. I&#039;d definetly shell out some BTC for the our fearless leaders memoirs!! I nominated Johnny Depp to play the part. Blow + POTC seems like perfect practice :)

				I hope DPR is writing *something* down.....<br /><br />I would keep the story of SR encrypted on a server in the middle of Mongolia and set it to be released all over the place if I don&#039;t check in at least once a week.&nbsp; :D Like a dead man&#039;s switch.<br /><br />There&#039;s already been a study on SR, and I bet if it keeps growing there will be more media attention.&nbsp; Hopefully it remains baseless speculation... ;)

				There will be documentaries made about it for sure. I am writing a book on the general subject of the technologies, philosophies and realpolitik of SR, it&#039;ll be like a cross between a reference book and and a primer on cypherpunk/anarcocapitalist perspective. I&#039;ll try and keep it friendly to the lay person curious about the subject but I&#039;ll need help debugging it, chapters will eventually start appearing on this forum.

				Good God pine! That is fantastic. I&#039;m really looking forward to that man.. although I&#039;m relatively new here, you sure are quite the legend in these parts. Who else better suited to write such a book.

				Can&#039;t wait for your book pine. Release it all at once and have it be part of DPR&#039;s book club.

				Nomad&#039;s book would be the most interesting hands down.&nbsp; Others would make great autobiographies .<br />I can imagine the juiciness.&nbsp; A good book would need aspects that Nomad described to make it good.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stories about clever Drug dealing has been done before.&nbsp; What makes this story good is the back story.&nbsp; &nbsp;THere would have to be a moral to the story like Blow and others to make it fundable to make for the masses though sadly .&nbsp; &nbsp;A hero story about drug dealing would be a hard sell even in today&#039;s world.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Now, if you make him a villan of sorts, trapped between two worlds,&nbsp; now you got a story.&nbsp; &nbsp;The story needs some negative aspects to make it good.&nbsp; Challenges, fights, lies, cheating, murder of friends, etc.&nbsp; these are human aspects we like to co experience in movies and books.&nbsp; Overcome the negatives and the challenges and morals and the audience looks up to the &#039;villian&#039; now as a recovered hero of sorts who created an unstoppable machine that will challenge the morals of the world one keyboard stroke at a time.<br /><br />Then, you make a sub story about DPRs daughter.&nbsp; &nbsp; The one who is good in school, but has friends who use this website to buy drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad sees the package in the mailbox when he arrives home early one day.&nbsp; DPR wonders if he should punish his daughter or just leave it be?&nbsp; Freedom at last. <br /><br /><br />I think all positive stories are Walt Disney stories.&nbsp; :-) <br />
