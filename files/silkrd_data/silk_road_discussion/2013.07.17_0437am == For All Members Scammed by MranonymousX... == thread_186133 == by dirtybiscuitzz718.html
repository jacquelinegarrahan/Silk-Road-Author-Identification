				It saddens me to say that it has come to surface that the possible scammer in question, MRANONYMOUSX, has in fact gone rouge. <br /><br />He arrived a couple of months ago, developed a small, but trusting clientele base. He had excellent customer service and top notch MDMA. He even sent in a sample to the MDMA Avengers for washing and testing. I had personally spend a few hundred with him as well. <br /><br />A short time ago, he promoted a &#039;HUGE BULK MDMA SALE&#039; for FE, naturally. With my vouching for his service, and a handful of other previous buyers, he managed to get a load of FEs on bulk MDMA, to which he never delivered and now, his seller account is gone.<br /><br />I feel absolutely terrible for all those who FE on these large (and some not so large, but heavy enough to hurt) orders. I can not help but feel some what, in part, responsible for contributing to this massive FE scam. This is a public apology to all who may have took my backing him, as some sort of guiding light to making your would be purchase with MrA. I in no way had the slightest doubt in my mind, that MrA was going to come through for every one. As is always did for myself. <br /><br />Sadly, I did not in anyway, at one time or another, condone finalizing before your product had arrived and been confirmed as what had been advertised. As shitty as i feel about this, it is just another case and point, that no mater what, or why, no one should EVER FE if they can not afford to take the loss if it just so happened that way. <br /><br />My first SR order ever was a scam, and before i knew about these forums, i got right fucked as well. I think its safe to say that all of us, at some point in our SR dealings have been taken for an FE. Some much more $ than others, but i digress. Once more, i can not apologize enough to all who have been scammed by this CUNTRAG. I feel used, abused made a fool of and most of all, like i took some hand in all this. Im sorry again. <br /><br />As always, much love people.

				You never know. Even with bulk, don&#039;t FE unless you&#039;re cool with making a donation to that vendor.<br /><br />It&#039;s not your fault - if anyone made a purchase and FE based on one person&#039;s recommendation, I&#039;d be highly suspect of their longevity on SR.

				Dirty,<br /><br />That&#039;s sadly a risk that all of us that write reviews for vendors have. We risk every time that a scam vendor will use the popularity s/he gets from the review and our name for backup to then scam people.<br /><br />There&#039;s little, very sadly, to do about this, because you can never know in anticipation. If the product is bunk it&#039;s easy, but if the product is perfect, the price is good, stealth is fine etc. etc. you have no motivation to not endorse that particular vendor, but if that vendor wants to use this to scam s/he can do it without problems and you can do nothing about it. You will be caught in the middle and that&#039;s all.<br /><br />For this it&#039;s anyway very important for users to beware and take responsibility in any case. It doesn&#039;t matter if the vendor is endorsed by reviewers, threads (as LSD Avengers or Deemsters etc.; how many times it has happened btw that a good endorsed vendor on those lists has gone rogue? It has happened a lot, especially in the Avengers - what they can do about it if not to immediately let others know? Nothing) and whatever else, the user must always be attentive and not trust blindly a priori.<br /><br />Just because a buyer is endorse by a review or thread DON&#039;T FE anyway or don&#039;t trust him/her blindly in any case. It is not worth to do it, no matter what. If a vendor is legit the reasons to ask for FE are very little (only in certain particular cases they can be understood, in the others it&#039;s just obviously a way to go out of the system; even if not with the intention of scam, however the vendor will have the upper hand no matter what in any circumstance) so don&#039;t do it if not in those very particular cases, elsewhere if you do then you must understand that it&#039;s your own responsibility (and nobody&#039;s else but yours) and you can either lose that amount.<br /><br />I understand that you are sad about the happening and I would be too in your shoes. It feels extremely bad to be used, but there&#039;s nothing you can really do about it and it will surely happen again, no matter what. Just know, however, that the advantages of reviewing products greatly overcomes these bad things. You are still helping hundreds of people making a quality purchase and in 99% of the cases the buyers have bought a good product thanks to your help.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />BlackIris.

				If I can tell about a little thing where you have been naive, Dirty, is when Mr.A. started posting all those things about giving you 5 grams free of molly for month and then even 500$ worthy of product for free @ month; that was IMO a big red light that something was not so good or there was something that potentially could go really wrong.<br /><br />I can understand being generous vs. a person that helps you, but there&#039;s no way any vendor will give a person s/he doesn&#039;t either know 500$ worth of product free every month, it was obvious IMO that he wanted to manipulate you at that point and you should have understood it then.<br /><br />It was still too late because many already stupidly (and on this they have only themselves to blame) had FE (Mr.A was quite smart on it; he sent almost all the first orders, even those of larger quantities and then started posting the bullshit about the bulk offers to where naturally many people jumped in) but maybe it would have saved some of the last buyers of the 100g orders.<br /><br />When a person licks your butt too much, in EVERY circumstance (also legit), there&#039;s always a catch, always. Nobody especially in this business does anything for free. If the interaction starts getting too &quot;hot&quot; I always start thinking the worst (I had to learn the hard way myself), or at the very least I start asking myself &quot;so, where&#039;s the catch?&quot;.<br /><br />Again I&#039;m very sorry for you Dirty, but I&#039;m sure you have learned something out of this and next time it will be much more difficult for someone to manipulate you.

				There&#039;s no need to do easy sarcasm.<br /><br />Dirty committed an error (and only of being a little naive, since the real error was of those buyers) and he apologized publicly for this, and this is even more than was expected from him.<br /><br />Totally the contrary of how you acted since you NEVER took responsibility of what you have done in the past, and you continue to not do so.<br /><br />So stop pretending making the morale to others; you are surely the worst person in the position to do so.

In any other instance, it is. Only it wasnt here with MrA, cause dude, when i tell you, he would hook me the fuck up. If I was paying for a gram, he often sent two. If i bought 3 he would send 5. Now again, usually that in it self would seem to come with a catch. Thing was, i was literally one of, if not THE first customer of his. First that was a member of these forums for sure. Once the first order went off so smoothly, I had no choice but to leave my honest feedback in his thread. <br /><br />&nbsp;When asked why, or when i would tell him he did not have to hook me up like he was, he often replied to me how much I helped kick start, boost and promote his business. For this he would exclaim that he would always take care of me, how ever it may be. So when I got word of his 5 gram a month offer, for free.. I figured, shit, hes doing pretty damn well it seems, more power to him and ill gladly take some return on my helping him along. <br /><br />Idk how often youve seen my posts, or how much youve followed my posts/threads, if at all Iris but Im no fool, LOL. Shit happens, and the world keeps turning. Much love man.
