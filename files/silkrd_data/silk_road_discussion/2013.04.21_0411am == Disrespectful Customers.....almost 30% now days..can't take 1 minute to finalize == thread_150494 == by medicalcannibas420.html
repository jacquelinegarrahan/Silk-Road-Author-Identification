				I seem to be hearing about this a lot from different vendors. I feel for those who have a lot of cash tied up in escrow and need to obtain more product. I understand that sometimes things happen, but one should always make an effort to order products when they will be around to receive them with access to SR. Finalizing right after receiving and inspecting the product is quite satisfying for me!

				Not a vendor here, but I feel your frustration. I am always quick to finalize same day, been a buyer on SR here coming up on 2 years....I think its because too many kids have gotten on SR.....it won&#039;t be around much longer, I&#039;m afraid :(<br /><br />Hell, I only have a small group of vendors I use now anymore. No new vendors, period. Good luck in getting your coin man.

				I&#039;m having the exact same problem too, they dont have respect for the fact that we&#039;re trying to run a business, they take the product, test it, sell it then still complain looking for a partial refund, I think vendors should start a thread naming and shaming these people so we dont get stung by them and can cancel their orders or request to finalize early. I also think that we should be able to hit a &quot;feedback&quot; button on buyers and leave our own feedback so other sellers can be sure who&#039;s good and who&#039;s bad. <br /><br />

				Crap sellers.<br /><br />Try to deliver within 1 week for just once!<br /><br />Even domestic does a 80 mile trip for delivery take more then 1 week.<br />Still I have to give 5/5 or at least it is expected, so i do it.<br /><br />Domestic is 2 days enough.<br /><br />The longer you let us wait, the longer it&#039;s going to take to finalize.<br />Cuz we do not F.E. !<br /><br /><br />But from where the complains?<br /><br />Complaining when you do sell 30 items per day and have to wait...<br />Complaining when you sell only 3 items per month.<br />Complaining and complains, always complaining.<br /><br />When you sell three items each day and no shipment will reach it&#039;s destination with in one week, you will have over 20 orders in the pipeline.<br />20 times a let&#039;s say 50 euro average for 1 item, is 1000 euro.<br /><br />Ain&#039;t difficult to calculate and predict.<br /><br />Always the same...<br /><br />I know you guys, complaining when you have to pay 500.000 dollar on taxes but complaining too if the taxman only can ask/demand 500 dollar.<br />You can&#039;t have it both ways.<br />Or you are selling bigtime, doing good business and pay a lot of taxes or you don&#039;t make a lot of money, and pay little taxes.<br /><br />I wished I have to pay 500.000 dollar on taxes, then I know I did well and made a lot of profit.<br /><br />Thank god that there is 1 month in the year when you guys complain less...<br />...FEBRUARY...!<br /><br />Why do we complain less in the month of February, you say?<br />Because you complainers are complaining each and every month the same , more or less<br />That&#039;s the reason why you complainers do complain less in February<br /><br />Still dont get it?<br /><br />You complaining complainers have not the chance to complain the same amount of complains in February.<br /><br />Hard to understand for some complaining sellers.<br />You have to be a satisfied, non complaining buyer to understand.<br /><br />I will look at your sellersite on the main SR site , just to see how you do with your counting.<br />I bet most sellers have the same issues, and we don&#039;t here them cry.<br />A occasion complain every now and then, here and there, from...(yep) a complainer.<br /><br />My complain is you, complaining.<br />I don&#039;t have pity for you!<br /><br />What goes around comes around.<br /><br />

				There is actually one instance where I would prefer that customers not finalize right away and I learned this the hard way. When the BTC is in freefall, even if the orders are hedged, once they finalize and it&#039;s in your SR wallet and the BTC is going down, down, down, you will see your wallet drop accordingly.<br /><br />I had a ton of orders finalize when BTC was at ~$250 and lost a ton of money. If only those customers had waited a day or two till the BTC dropped to like $70, I still would have been paid the BTC equivalent of my USD and wouldn&#039;t have lost any money at all...<br /><br />So a word of advice for the good customers out there, if you see BTC in freefall you might want to message your vendor and ask if they would prefer you wait a few days before finalizing to see if the BTC stabilizes.<br /><br />Just my $.02.

				@Molly,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I see where you&#039;re coming from, but that just adds another RULE to follow...Always finalize as soon as you receive your goods...oh, EXCEPT when BTC are going down.&nbsp; It&#039;s fine when BTC double after placing an order to finalize, right? I&#039;m not trying to start anything, I just think we should stick to one rule:Finalize as soon as you get your goods. That&#039;s what hedging is for right?<br /><br />I&#039;m new to all this, but have made 5 orders, 3 of which have already arrived and have finalized immediately (with my TOR app on android in some cases to make it faster)

				I always finalize as soon as I receive my product and open it up. Usually before I even weigh it. I can understand the frustration of vendors, though. It would probably get me a little upset as well. But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to blacklist users that finalize a day or so after they get their package. Some people like to test it out before leaving a review. Others are just busy. Unless it&#039;s 3+ days or if it leads to auto-finalizing then I would maybe think about making a list and putting it on your vendor page to discourage others from waiting so long. And I also never even thought about messaging a vendor when BTC value is falling like that. If there is ever a sharp decline in BTC value I think I shall do that.

				There should be a different auto-finalize period depending on where the buyer and vendor is. If it is domestic, one week is more than enough time.

I know I would have appreciated it if more customers had waited a day or two in that case.<br /><br />But yes, in general I agree it is best to finalize as early as possible. I only make a shit-list for customers that auto-finalize. I will not deal with those customers again... it&#039;s a cash and carry business and I can only keep moving product if finalizations go quickly.

				While I always finalize within an hour of receiving my packages I also have a business to run and have a job as well and sometime can&#039;t open the package until later in the day or I might need to run a QP asap to somebody. If I take too long they go find someone else and I lose money. I understand wanting your money as soon as possible but pming the shit out of customers a couple hours after it says delivered sounds super impatient and unprofessional esp. Since you don&#039;t know if they were home or able to open it right away. And messaging shipping info that should be destroyed is unacceptable and should be reported if you ask me. Would never do business with someone who acted like that. That&#039;s my .02

				Here&#039;s one for you; we had a customer just 4 days ago, so happy with the service they received that they PM&#039;d us in SR and poured out the compliments - when their package arrived - and here we are on day 3; they still have not finalized - still have not given feed back where they are supposed to, lol!&nbsp; <br /><br />I read that PM and just replied with &#039;??????&#039;s&#039; and &#039;glad you loved your service/product but why didn&#039;t you finalize?&#039;. ???<br /><br />We&#039;ve seen good customers come and go. All repeat customers get special attentions and bonuses for being so regular as a show of appreciation. But recently the past 3 customers have been 1. new and 2. flakes, nice flakes but flakes no less! <br /><br />Shrug? c&#039;est la vie, no?<br /><br />Hezký den! Everyone!<br />

				Ya I feel you bro. I always finalize within an hour if possible. Always same day and I do agree there should be no reason to take longer than 24hours to finalize after the customer gets and inspects the package. Sorry for not commenting accurately. If the customer tries to scam then that&#039;s a different story then. But indeed you should be paid promptly if their package was on weight and quality was as advertised. What I really hate is when I see leave feedback here on someone&#039;s vendor page... How hard is it to tell others how the product and service is? Another thing I think everyone should do... Leave HONEST detailed feedback. Anyways hope you get some better customers and everything goes smoothly from here on out. Peace

				SR has also been down a lot lately. I&#039;ve been constantly refreshing for the past 2 hours so that I can FE an order. This could be the cause of your problem.

				I don&#039;t know who you&#039;re selling to but I haven&#039;t really had any finalization issues, I&#039;d guess over 90% finalize right away.&nbsp; Even with me selling to a higher percentage of noobs than I&#039;m sure many vendors are.&nbsp; <br /><br />One guy auto-finalized a sample, hope he enjoyed it because it&#039;s the last he&#039;s getting from me.&nbsp; A handful of others have finalized within 3 days of receiving their package (slow but acceptable), and I&#039;ve had to send a couple messages out to people, who then finalized within the day.<br /><br />*shrug* It&#039;s a business, you&#039;re dealing with people.&nbsp; Many are good, some suck, that&#039;s just the way it goes.

				I have also noticed this, I always had a 97%+ rating until about a month ago.<br />Now I have people leave less than 5/5 for the most crazy reasons.<br />IE giving me a 1/5 for canceling their free sample order because they did not meet requirements for one leaving bad feedback for not giving out tracking even though the buyer never bothered to ask.

				I&#039;ve been buying drugs for decades. It&#039;s not hard.<br /><br />You want the transaction to be quick, discreet and successful. If the dope is shit move on until you find a better dealer.<br /><br />When you find that better dealer you stick with him/her through thick and thin, and if they are a good dealer they will stick with you.<br /><br />Never ask for tick and you may get offered it, always keep your mouth shut, always be cool and don&#039;t bring things on top for the dealer or yourself.<br /><br />Not paying your dealer is gross stupidity. Do you think they&#039;re going to have anything to do with you next time? You just shot yourself in the foot buddy.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not a vendor atm, but as a buyer I ALWAYS finalize as soon as I open the packet and check the goods. I want the Road to run far and smooth for as many folk as possible.<br /><br />Is it really true that the SR is becoming saturated with the stupid little scrotes that IRL will rip you off for 0.5g of shitty weed that&#039;s been covered in crushed glass to make it look like THC crystals? (I kid you not)

				My first transaction was through a vendor with a very good rep. My 2nd and 3rd transactions were through relatively new vendors. Hey, everyone has to start somewhere right? If my transaction doesn&#039;t go well, I will deal with someone else next time. Same as on the street. It&#039;s just that it&#039;s safer and more convenient to order from SR these days...for me anyway. I&#039;m getting too old to &quot;run the streets.&quot; I&#039;m keeping it real on my end and I can only hope the vendors I order from do the same. So far, all have done so. (OK, so the quality on my last batch wasn&#039;t as expected...but it weighed and was legit dope)

				I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s just a case of there being a lot of n00bs who don&#039;t know how finalization works.&nbsp; I&#039;m tempted to say that there should be more detailed statistics for buyers so that vendors really could get a better idea of how their customers are.&nbsp; As someone who is only a buyer (ie not a vendor) I have the suspicion that some of my vendors don&#039;t even know how to look up buyer stats (this *is* possible as a vendor, right?!).<br /><br />I typically compare my transactions vs. the street when giving feedback and if I look at my feedback the only visible one that is not 5/5 was SuperTrips who obviously was a mess (multiple times).&nbsp; For instance with MDMA I am buying at what I consider a very cheap price and getting on-average much higher quality than the stuff on the street.&nbsp; A lot of buyers on here seem to think they are big-shots and want to hit vendors where it hurts.<br /><br />What some buyers forget is that the healthier SR is for vendors, the healthier it will be for buyers.&nbsp; Sometimes the biggest challenges a community faces come from within the community.
