				I&#039;ve only had one missing order out of 15 until last week.&nbsp; I placed two orders from two different vendors and neither one showed up.&nbsp; Both these vendors have 100 feedback and have been communicating.&nbsp; In both cases, the tracking number returns no data on USPS&#039;s web site.&nbsp; What are the odds of two quality vendors having packages go missing in the same week?<br />If the tracking number returns an &quot;invalid&quot; message from both, could it be that USPS is losing the packages on purpose?&nbsp; If a package is intercepted by USPS what does the tracking info usually return?<br />Any replies are appreciated.<br />thx

				How late are they?<br /><br />I just had my first order that didn&#039;t show up also. It was from a very reputable vendor, sent priority mail. I&#039;ve been in communication with the vendor, but he doesn&#039;t have a way to track it.

				Shipments not showing up. Bummer. I&#039;ve only lost 5 packages out of over 200+. And I recently shipped to NYC and other heavily storm damaged areas. Just before the storm! So far so good. I am sure the other reliable vendors will come through. But they should have a way to track it. But hey, honestly.... I&#039;ve lost or destroyed delivery/ confirmation slips before there time. It happens. <br /><br />If your shipment never arrives a good vendor will work w/ya. It just sucks NOT getting your fix on time! I hope the shipments come through for ya. Good luck

				I am waiting on an order from the UK and I&#039;m hoping it is late because of the storm. I didn&#039;t want to order from outside the US but I took a chance because the vendor is highly rated and nobody state side had the quantity of the particular product stateside. Let&#039;s all keep our fingers crossed :-\

				My vendor is great and has already offered a full refund if it doesn&#039;t show by Friday. The bad part is that up until now I&#039;ve only had 3 orders, and the shipment I haven&#039;t received actually consists of 4 transactions. If all of them get refunded I assume that will put my refunded rate at 57% (4 refunded out of 7), which vendors won&#039;t be excited about.<br /><br />As for why it can&#039;t be tracked, he said he normally could track Priority mail, but for reasons I don&#039;t understand (because I don&#039;t ever ship) this time he couldn&#039;t.

				Great news! Mine just showed up today. 7 days via priority mail sucks, but it&#039;s nice to know it wasn&#039;t confiscated. Next time I&#039;ll just use first class.

The seller had already started to discuss resolution with me but no need now. He tried to track it but tracking # showed what he called &quot;stuck&quot; (I&#039;m in US and he is overseas, so not sure how much info is provided when he tracks) which he said usually indicated that it was confiscated by customs. I just had this feeling that the hurricane was fucking everything trans-Atlantic up and even screwing with domestic mail. If you have a similar situation I say wait it out a few more days, but be mindful of the seller&#039;s rating and feedback.<br /><br />Also, if your package shows up with Delivery Confirmation service but the number does not show in the system as if it was lost in the mail, please please be honest with your vendor and don&#039;t hold it against them if your order was placed in the last 2 weeks or so. I totally could have scammed my vendor and claimed non-receipt but karma is real and will get you when you least expect it. Scumbag gets as scumbag does.

				&nbsp;I was very happy to check my mail today...both orders showed up!&nbsp; One due to a kind vendor re-sending, and the other was delayed because it had its origin in NY.&nbsp; I guess I was spoiled by the near flawless shipment history I was used to.&nbsp; The best part is that both vendors were very understanding and did everything they could to help.<br />I&#039;d leave their names but I am not sure if they want publicity.<br />MrDDro, you are another great vendor...highly recommended.<br />

But let me clear up something again. PRIORITY MAIL (envelopes) does NOT GET THERE ANY FASTER THAN FIRST CLASS MAIL. Yes, large boxes that are shipped priority will possibly show up a day or two faster, but if you&#039;re talking envelopes or those smaller packges, they do NOT get there any faster. This is the big &quot;scam&quot; of the postal service, they get to charge people extra, without it really getting there any faster. Priority Mail arrives 2-7 days from Coast to Coast (anywhere in the US). This is also true of priority. Check the USPS website and learn more. You can also google people&#039;s experiences with what I&#039;ve stated.
