				I placed a order with one of the vendors and was asked to FE. After looking at recent feedback I decided to hold off and messaged him stating that if this was a problem to go ahead and cancel the order. I messaged him several more times and went ahead and asked him to cancel. I never received a response or a package. Anyways I went ahead and hit the resolve button and gave details about the transaction. It now shows in the resolution center but says due in 10 hours. What happens at the 10hr mark? I am afraid that it will automatically become finalized and I will loose my funds. Any suggestions or advice?

				SR Resolution will decide what to do most times since you did not FE for the vendor they will do a full refund unless the vendor claims he shipped then he may want 50/50 split look beside the SR resolution were it says view click it and see if the vendor made a complaint or is offering anything sometimes vendors ( like myself I ask for 10 days extension and then reship your parcel so there is no loss)If he made a cliam always fight it if he asked for an extension you will see where it says accept his offer

				That makes me feel much better. I checked that out earlier and saw my comments or statements but the seller never replied. I will update and let everyone know everyone know how it plays out.

				Hi TheDuke, just a tip for next time, ask the vendor before you place an order (and it&#039;s not written in the ad or on their vendor&#039;s page) if they require you to FE. That will save you the hassle of going through the resolution process in cases such as the one your in now.&nbsp; :) :)
