				Hi there&nbsp; :)<br /><br />First of all, let me just express my appreciation of the Silk Road.&nbsp; The concept and the application is frankly amazing and the community I see on here is strong and pretty damn united.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a lurker and buyer for a few months.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had successful buys from three Aus vendors and two international vendors.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t the account I usually post on because I don&#039;t want to get blacklisted.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how y&#039;all will take this and, in the tradition of Tor, I want to remain anonymous.<br /><br />Anyway, to cut a long story short: why is it that I can buy MDMA (and some other drugs) so much cheaper internationally than from Aussie vendors?<br /><br />I know MDMA isn&#039;t produced much in Aus.&nbsp; All right, that means its always going to cost more.&nbsp; But I&#039;m going to assume that most of the small time Aussie vendors simply buy the product they resell from reputable international vendors (your Ivorys, SKYYs, DrNyxs) then sell it domestically.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good business model.&nbsp; The vendor takes the risk of importing then marks it up and sells it on.&nbsp; But-why do they mark it up so much?&nbsp; From around $60 for a gram of Ivory&#039;s finest to $200-300 for Australian customers?<br /><br />I know it&#039;s a risky business importing the stuff..&nbsp; But if I can anonymously and safely import it, with about 95% confidence I won&#039;t get caught and that the worst that will happen is a missing package.....&nbsp; And that just using the advice and common sense that I learned from reading these forums.<br /><br />I know the street pricing is the same or probably way above what Aussie vendors sell on here, with less purity.&nbsp; But when international vendors (say from the US) import it from the Netherlands or the UK and sell it on, they don&#039;t mark it up so much.<br /><br />I know Australian border protection is looked on as pretty damn tough.&nbsp; However, from what I&#039;ve read on these forums, they match what you&#039;d find in any Western country.&nbsp; The image and reputation doesn&#039;t match the fact that the international vendors who sell to Aus are mostly successful.<br /><br />I know that vendors are doing us a service and they can set any damn price they want.&nbsp; I realise that.&nbsp; So if nothing changes from this thread, I&#039;m not going to harp on about it.&nbsp; I know that vendors need to mark up their prices for the risk they take and the effort they go to.&nbsp; But to mark it up from around $60 to $2/300?<br /><br />I also know the prices are slowly coming down, in stops and starts.&nbsp; That&#039;s good.<br /><br />My challenge to everyone is: make this fairer.&nbsp; Make MDMA cost a fair bit but don&#039;t make it cost an arm and a leg.&nbsp; On the streets, there&#039;s people buying shit cut with God knows what for $20.&nbsp; Silk Road is acting to minimise the harm caused by that....&nbsp; but how can it when the pure stuff costs more than the average Joe can easily afford?&nbsp; Sure they could buy internationally, and they will, but I for one would like to keep my buck here at home.&nbsp; Even the money from the black market winds up as money spent in the &#039;clean&#039; economy.<br /><br />Or is Silk Road only for the elite and wealthy?

				I am not from Australia, but loads of my friends have emigrated to Australia in recent years due to the state of our own economy. Many of my friends were regular enough drug users before they went to OZ; they have pretty much stopped now on account of the prices that dealers charge down there.<br /><br />I guess it all boils down to supply and demand. If the supply is limited, with huge demand, dealers can charge what they want for it. There is always someone willing to pay. I guess it is partly to do with the high risk of importing drugs into Oz, because your customs are pretty tough cookies and in that situation, premium prices are charged to cover the risks being taken.

				Ha.&nbsp; I threw away my password thinking I wouldn&#039;t post here again.&nbsp; So...&nbsp; yes.<br /><br />@ghostcat:&nbsp; Exactly!<br /><br />@LouisCyphre:&nbsp; Agree on the pricing being set by organised crime.<br /><br />I&#039;m not entirely sure about the connection you made with the Victorian gangland war and the drop in MDMA pricing.&nbsp; As far as I know, there were many factors that led to that, chiefly the dispute between the Morans and Williams.<br /><br />Agree with the power vacuum thing.<br /><br />I disagree with you on the consequences of selling MDMA on the cheap.&nbsp; First, we&#039;re pretty anonymous here.&nbsp; If sellers are using Tor right and have good security processes, there&#039;s an excellent chance of them avoiding the gangs. Never 100%, of course.<br /><br />Second, Silk Road at the moment is strictly small fish.&nbsp; We&#039;re nothing compared to the street dealing.<br /><br />Third, ideally speaking we shouldn&#039;t be giving in to the gangs.<br /><br />@PaulMuadDib:&nbsp; Exactly.&nbsp; This is why we need cheaper pricing on SR.<br /><br />@Aussie reviewer account:&nbsp; Damn, you should be avoiding street and local dealing.&nbsp; None of this is a game, but THAT is definitely not a game.<br /><br />A lot of what you said is the same as what I said...&nbsp; If I were a seller I would sell it for more than its worth and less than the street price.&nbsp; How about...&nbsp; $80-100 for 1 gram MDMA?&nbsp; I would do this in an attempt to get other vendors&#039; price lowered.<br /><br />The risk of getting caught is always present, for buyers and sellers, with serious consequences.<br /><br />@LouisCyphre again:&nbsp; Even if there was more competition on SR, I have my doubts whether pricing will go down.&nbsp; It&#039;d be nice though.

				Sorry for the double post.<br /><br />I was just thinking it&#039;s a bit sad to see that none of the major Aussie vendors really commented on this, even negatively...&nbsp; or better yet, rose up to the challenge!<br /><br />However, also wanted to apologize--I assumed when I first posted there would be epic flaming, but everyone&#039;s been very cool.&nbsp; Responses have been considered and well-put.&nbsp; Thanks :)

				I think the prices for MDMA are fair based on what they risk etc , however vendors needs to realise that we lose between 10-20% in getting BTC. I would gladly pay 200-250 for the quality MDMA that we have here but on the streets but once you add the extra 10-20% to get BTC it adds up fast.<br /><br />Having said that I will pay what ever vendors are asking, albeit just not as frequently as I would like and I also ration myself more when its an expensive drug (naturally)<br /><br />Drugs will never be cheap though.

				totally agree kingpin, i&#039;d be happy to pay $200/g more often than paying $250+, but as you said when you look at the actual cost of the BTC, the prices on offer are between $250-$300, when you take into account BTC fees, when i first came on SR you could get domestic MDMA for between $180-200 (total cost incl. BTC fees).<br />Maybe the problem now is that there is no competition, a while back you had a different high rated aussie sellers, maybe that kept the prices down.<br /><br />I for one would definitely be getting more if it were cheaper, but id rather just go without than pay grossly inflated prices.<br />:)

Especially when you have to put huge amounts of time and effort into getting established as well as accepting an even bigger risk of getting caught. If you want to make money you&#039;re not looking at occasionally importing a gram or two, you&#039;re looking at going bulk. Which ups the risk even more, and in turn ups the final price we pay.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s an interesting point.&nbsp; I suppose there&#039;s two types of vendors we&#039;re talking about then; the part-time ones and the full-time ones.&nbsp; The part time ones will be looking to use selling as a way to (probably) add some extra income on the side.&nbsp; The full-time ones will be using selling as their main income, and seeing it as a profitable income.<br /><br />When you consider that without considering risk, you&#039;d assume that the part-time ones would price their stuff higher and the full-time ones will price lower.<br /><br />Factoring in for risk, you get the opposite.<br /><br />Then again, you&#039;d expect the full-time vendors to have better security and well-defined, lower risk supply (meaning with more access to boxes and so on).&nbsp; If a full-time vendor is ordering in bulk to his own address...&nbsp; that&#039;s a scary thought.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a solution in all of this.&nbsp; Maybe MDMA is always going to be a drug for the wealthy, in Aus?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28320.msg320099#msg320099">Quote from: moksha on July 02, 2012, 06:20 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You&#039;re right that more competition is probably the only thing that will drive prices down, short of the dalai lama coming back to Australia with keys of MDMA up his ass to spread the love. <br /><br />All I can say is that it&#039;s nice to suggest it, but don&#039;t hold your breathe that the local vendors will go out of their way, and out of their pocket to massively discount their stock.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh I know that.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice dream.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28320.msg320099#msg320099">Quote from: moksha on July 02, 2012, 06:20 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you want to send a message then stop buying from the vendors you feel price their stock too high.

				Agree, it&#039;s a little higher than it should be. $250AUD for a g works out to about $25 per dose, which is *ok* considering you&#039;ll pay $25-$30 in a club for an lesser quality pill version. <br /><br />But considering we ourselves are willing to buy in bulk - notably above the &quot;personal&quot; amount defined by law (0.75g) we too are taking a comparable legal risk to the dealer.

Aside from attempts to manage any scammers or genuine disputes and transaction fees to keep the site going, there&#039;s none of the normal government impositions on trade (e.g. tax, tarriffs, exclusive deals, etc.).&nbsp; It&#039;s entirely down to who delivers the best product in a secure and consistent manner to which section of the market.&nbsp; It&#039;s fascinating to watch (in as much as it can be watched here on the forums).<br /><br />As SR grows and a percentage of the new members become vendors, we should see some gradual fluctuation as they try to compete with each other and the existing vendors.&nbsp; The rate at which that increase occurs is unknown, especially when many people have multiple accounts.<br /><br />To simplify it a little, once the growth rate has across the globe has increased considerably, it should end up as a buyers&#039; market if the vendors active at that point in the future have an uninterrupted supply of products across the board.<br /><br />The SR vendors could try making their own cartel to throttle supply and drive prices back up, but human nature dictates that another vendor will take advantage of that by undercutting them.&nbsp; Then the members of this hypothetical (and more than a little unlikely) cartel would begin to lose their nerve, would compete with the lower price and the cartel would fall apart.<br /><br />One day a sociologist (and/or an anthropologist) is going to log into these forums and come on the spot at the sight of this twisted bazaar.<br />

				It&#039;s been years since I was young enough to be raving away on MDMA (talking 90s happy hardcore days, combined with the old Gravity/DCs combined venue days for the Perth folks - the major hardcore and drum-n-base club sharing a courthard with an &#039;open sexuality&#039; house club, making acceptance of gays/lesbians central to the Perth scene many years before acceptance of gays spread into mass culture (funny how such achievements are overlooked by the anti-rave, anti-drugs crowd).<br /><br />But even back then, pills in Oz were MUCH more expensive than pills in the UK/Europe.<br /><br />But there was a BIG difference. In Oz, pills were very high % MDMA, wherein a single pill would give 3-4 hours of huggy, lovey danciness, combined with bursts of chill out lovin&#039; (safety campaigns run within the scene emphasised the need to take breaks from dancing and lower your body temperature to avoid overheating). In the UK around that same time, folks were necking 5 tabs+ to get a loose approximation of that effect, with the pills containing mostly speed+caffeine and little MDMA between them.<br /><br />In those days at least, the price difference was huge, but taken as $/per-MDMA it was very reasonable.

				We&#039;ll maybe see a market correction in prices, but there will always be a proportion of the population that buy into the culture and zeitgiest, where all the BS and trappings of getting pills will outweigh the cost.&nbsp; The more of those types there are, the longer the 500% discrepancy between Local and Int&#039;l Molly prices will remain.<br /><br />I kinda got tired of the &#039;discussion&#039; about this elseware because it degenerated into a pathetic flame-war between the local sycophants and anyone who even dare ask the question.&nbsp; The problem is, that I don&#039;t see anything changing domestic Molly prices anytime soon.&nbsp; It hasn&#039;t really changed in the past 15 years, and it&#039;s not like SR is going to make much of a dent, so my philosophy is &#039;Fuck the local guys, I&#039;m buying International&#039;. For a lot of things, it&#039;s exactly what I do IRL, too.&nbsp; Don&#039;t like paying $270 for a pair of jeans that&#039;s $125 in the US?&nbsp; Buy it online!<br /><br />To be frank, if I had a local connection I&#039;d probably happily pay a reasonable upcharge for &#039;Risk&#039;, it&#039;s just that I don&#039;t think 500% is reasonable.&nbsp; What&#039;s happened in Australia I&#039;m guessing, is that the Molly market was set up to sell to rebellious middle class ravers who could afford fluro pants and a couple of hundred bucks to get high, and as demand has increased quality has gone down, profits sky-rocketed, and price remained the same due to lack of competition or anything else driving the prices down.<br /><br />And now we&#039;re left with a country where the gear is shit and prices are ridiculous.<br /><br />*Boom* And now we have SR!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I think there&#039;s a market for a few more small time Domestic operators on here, but in terms of it having an impact on the AU market?

It&#039;s a marketplace - not a ghetto territory.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;8)<br /><br />To every seedy cunt who knowingly ripped me of: suck my balls! The gig is up.<br /><br />One of the greatest things SR has given me is independence from the thugs who used to control the drugs.

In Oz, pills were very high % MDMA, wherein a single pill would give 3-4 hours of huggy, lovey danciness, combined with bursts of chill out lovin&#039; (safety campaigns run within the scene emphasised the need to take breaks from dancing and lower your body temperature to avoid overheating). In the UK around that same time, folks were necking 5 tabs+ to get a loose approximation of that effect, with the pills containing mostly speed+caffeine and little MDMA between them.<br /><br />In those days at least, the price difference was huge, but taken as $/per-MDMA it was very reasonable.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interesting how things have changed, huh?&nbsp; Now it&#039;s the UK with the super MDMA and Aus that&#039;s selling shite for way too much.&nbsp; Street-wise, anyway.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28320.msg352454#msg352454">Quote from: MyChemicalRomance on July 18, 2012, 01:14 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We&#039;ll maybe see a market correction in prices, but there will always be a proportion of the population that buy into the culture and zeitgiest, where all the BS and trappings of getting pills will outweigh the cost.&nbsp; The more of those types there are, the longer the 500% discrepancy between Local and Int&#039;l Molly prices will remain.<br /><br />I kinda got tired of the &#039;discussion&#039; about this elseware because it degenerated into a pathetic flame-war between the local sycophants and anyone who even dare ask the question.&nbsp; The problem is, that I don&#039;t see anything changing domestic Molly prices anytime soon.&nbsp; It hasn&#039;t really changed in the past 15 years, and it&#039;s not like SR is going to make much of a dent, so my philosophy is &#039;Fuck the local guys, I&#039;m buying International&#039;. For a lot of things, it&#039;s exactly what I do IRL, too.&nbsp; Don&#039;t like paying $270 for a pair of jeans that&#039;s $125 in the US?&nbsp; Buy it online!<br /><br />To be frank, if I had a local connection I&#039;d probably happily pay a reasonable upcharge for &#039;Risk&#039;, it&#039;s just that I don&#039;t think 500% is reasonable.&nbsp; What&#039;s happened in Australia I&#039;m guessing, is that the Molly market was set up to sell to rebellious middle class ravers who could afford fluro pants and a couple of hundred bucks to get high, and as demand has increased quality has gone down, profits sky-rocketed, and price remained the same due to lack of competition or anything else driving the prices down.<br /><br />And now we&#039;re left with a country where the gear is shit and prices are ridiculous.<br /><br />*Boom* And now we have SR!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I think there&#039;s a market for a few more small time Domestic operators on here, but in terms of it having an impact on the AU market? NnnnnnnIdontthinkso.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, there&#039;s a difference between having an impact on Australian street pricing and Australian SR pricing.&nbsp; We can&#039;t change the situation on the street, we&#039;d get beaten shitless.<br /><br />But we can change the situation on SR...&nbsp; although I&#039;m doubtful whether we will.&nbsp; The majority of posters on this thread are just accepting the situation.&nbsp; Change will not happen as a result.
