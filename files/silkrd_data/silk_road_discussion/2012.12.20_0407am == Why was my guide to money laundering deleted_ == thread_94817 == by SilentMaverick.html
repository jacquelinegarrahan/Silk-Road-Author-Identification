				I just replied in detail to a thread asking about money laundering with 5 methods that legitimately work to launder drug money. I have an economics degree and have been involved in &#039;shady&#039; finance for several years and felt qualified to answer the OPs questions as that is a topic that is a personal interest of mine. The methods I proposed have been personally tested my myself and people I know.<br /><br />So why was the thread deleted? Is there some rule here against explaining how to cashout as a vendor or divulging money laundering secrets?<br /><br />Maybe I should start offering my services as a consultant on money laundering, but i&#039;d rather just give out advice for free.<br /><br />EDIT: If anyone wants advice on money laundering or vendor cashout just ask in this thread or send me a PM and I will help you at absolutely no cost, but your welcome to swing me a bit of BTC if you like what I have to say :)

				1) All the advice in that thread was terrible<br /><br />2) Your advice was probably terrible too<br /><br />3) You shouldn&#039;t discuss ways to launder money on an open forum, that&#039;s how the LE learns how people are doing it

Awwwful lot of hawkies in here............ That&#039;s why you NEVER give this out on the forums. Also, discussing it over PM is no better unless they are proven or at least recommended. May I suggest Lim?<br /><br />lol modziw btw
