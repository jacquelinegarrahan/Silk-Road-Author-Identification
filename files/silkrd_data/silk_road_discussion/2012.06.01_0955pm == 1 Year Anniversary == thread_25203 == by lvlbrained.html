				Today marks the 1 year anniversary from the Gawker article that changed everything for the silk road (http://gawker.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable).<br /><br />It means its probably marks 1 year since many of the people here first found silk road. It&#039;s been a crazy 365 days and just wanted to say thanks to Silk Road and DPR for a great year. Theres been alot of ups and alot of downs but we are still here and doing better then ever. So thanks again Silk Road, and heres to looking forward to our second anniversary and a big FUCK YOU to senator Schumer who attacked Silk Road a year ago pledging to get it shut down. nice try asshole.

				In a couple of days I&#039;ll be celebrating in a big way.&nbsp; &nbsp;;) <br /><br />This is all the more delightful knowing that Chuck Schumer&#039;s effort to close Silk Road resulted in such a spectacular FAIL.

				Chuck Schumer. God.. What a fucking piece of shit name.<br /><br />It rings like the sort of guy that rubs mayonaise on his balls and takes pictures of himself in his wifes dresses, which he almost certainly does.<br /><br />Hey there Chucky.. How&#039;s it going? 1 year in, and noone harmed, no-one dead.. Your beliefs are kinda a big fat cocksuck aren&#039;t they, you little puritan piece of shit. <br /><br />These people need to die off if the human species is to rise to anywhere like the height demanded by its dignity and its intelligence. I&#039;m not typically social darwinist, but these people just need to die off. They are retarding our species.

				Yes Schumer is a piece of shit and all these fevered egos which are destroying our collective unconscious will either wake up to the pain and suffering they are causing or will be dealt with as we the people cannot allow this type of tyranny to go on against us. Its time to take our power back as a citizen we hold the most important seat in the country. This seems to be an amazing community from only being here couple weeks and I&#039;m looking forward to many more years on SR!
