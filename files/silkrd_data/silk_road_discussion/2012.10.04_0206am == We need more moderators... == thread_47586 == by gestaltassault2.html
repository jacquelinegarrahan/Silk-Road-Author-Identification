				This is not your ordinary forum. I believe that it is run very closely by DPR and he/she can not trust all of our lives with just anyone, nor with too many.<br /><br />The software angle sounds good, but perhaps there are security issues with outside software.<br /><br />Hopefully DPR can write something to cut it down. In the mean time, just ignore it and keep encouraging the good folks.<br /><br />Modzi

				Though I agree ...we could use more moderators...we actually just lost one in lim...if we had 20 more they could not help the spamming situation really. Because of TOR you can&#039;t ban IP&#039;s and you can&#039;t ban screen names. I mean you can but they just make another one. If you really think about it..there is little spamming. Yes, in the last month these BTC idiots have done a lot and they will continue regardless of how many mods we have. And the reason is there are still ton&#039;s of idiots on here.<br /><br />All the post made about how to get BTC and what not to do...yet these fucking retards on here actually have gone to that site and used their fucking Paypal account and &quot;bought&quot; BTC!!!! I can&#039;t even fathom how stupid you would have to be to do that. Yet some moron just a couple days ago did it..then came in here and tried to explain that he didn&#039;t know...and how would he???? He said he looked on this board for info about it and couldn&#039;t find any..lol so he made a purchase. There is only a fucking sticky about it!!!!Let alone if you were smarter then a 1st grader you would realize that if someone is selling something that is $6... yet it is really going for $12 ...you are getting fucked.<br /><br />So until people stop being total fucking losers and complete morons.. these type of post will continue. It won&#039;t stop because of moderators but it will stop when it no longer works.<br /><br />I still cant believe 1 person fell for it or even takes the time to write a post asking if it is a real site. It just shows you how stupid people are.<br /><br /><br />Unlike other boards I think being a moderator on here is tough. Though I like how Lim worked..I could see how a lot of people didn&#039;t since he took shit personal and talked a lot of shit to people. People are sensitive bitches and do not want to be called out for being so stupid. I think on here you just need to lock threads and keep quiet. About a 180 from Lim. Also not easy to get a mod on here for free. It takes a lot of time out of your day im sure.<br /><br />Also I think mods should just move topics to the right board and lock threads that are totally against Silk Road policy.(i.e. trying to sell without a vendor account and asking for/talking about items you can&#039;t on SR according to DPR) and that should be it... Not chiming in on every topic or getting into fights with posters. So I am sure that sounds easier then it is.<br /><br />The best mods on here are the ones you don&#039;t hear from or see. You don&#039;t even know they are on here.I also think it is hard for DPR to get mods to work on here. This is a tough place. I actually like how you can say almost anything on here. It&#039;s nice we are treated like adults and not kids. I have seen boards where you get warnings for saying things and in every post a mod is in trying to police it. This board is in very good control considering the ease it is to get another screen name and make a post if you did get banned.<br /><br />Were lucky there is only a few spams on here and not tons like other boards.

I would be worse then Lim!! I actually think it would be a lot of work and not as easy as it seems. I&#039;m sure that is why it was hard for Lim. It is actually pretty boring as you need to read all the threads and then keep your mouth shut and just do the job required. Not post or respond to things said about you. It is really about the board and not you the mod. Would get old real fast. You see that sometimes DPR &quot;mods&quot; in here and moves a post to the right area. But that&#039;s just what we see. I am sure along with all the other work he comes in here and move/deletes stuff and we never know.<br /><br />&nbsp;We totally need them but at the same time I think DPR would want it done a certain way and that would be hard for a lot of people. People have their hands up to do it...but I think they don&#039;t realize what the job is. IMO.<br /><br />I do think that this board runs pretty smooth. Especially when you put into account it is a drug based board and people get/are high and say stupid shit.<br /><br />We need mods that their only job is to move things to the right place and delete/lock those threads that are about banned things per SR. Not give their personal opinions or remove something because THEY don&#039;t like it.<br /><br />And hello Wiz.. why the switch??<br />

				Honestly you should leave it how it is. I see very little of it but I still see it daily and I just ignore it. If some idiot is dumb enough to buy those fake btc ads well he/she clearly doesn&#039;t understand the concept of common sense and probably shouldn&#039;t be here. If something is too good to be true, well then it probably is!<br /><br />Anybody with half a brain knows the value of btc. $7.99 for 1 btc when they&#039;re worth in the range of $11-12.... <br /><br />Like I said we should leave them up so the idiots that buy it get discouraged from here and leave. :)

That is when the forum manipulation will begin, and little noticed censoring may occur. Or perhaps that moderator will go through the motions for a couple of weeks or months and build up a rapport with another member - who just so happens to be one of their colleagues - which will lead to them being recommended for a moderator position themselves, a decision which will most likely be supported by the community at large because &quot;well, they&#039;re just such a great person, right?&quot;<br />This is the deepweb. We are all anonymous here. To be frank, NONE of us have ANY idea who anyone else is, nor do we have any idea who may have been tasked with forum manipulation. I could be LE, you could be LE, absolutely any of us could be LE and there is nothing to be gained by burying one&#039;s head in the sand and ignoring this very real, very dangerous fact. I&#039;m not a paranoid person, and I have no real reason to be. I never see the bulk orders I place on here; I have no contact with the people receiving them, apart from an anonymous payment system. The only personal drugs I use are alcohol, caffeine, an occasional cycle of ephedrine when I&#039;m working out and the occasional viagra when I want to have a better night than usual. None of these will get me in trouble with the law in my country - the latter two might possibly get me a fine, yes, but no record or any other such madness. As such, my &#039;paranoia&#039; is aimed entirely at attempting to ensure the continued freedom of expression that we all enjoy here.<br /><br />We don&#039;t need more moderators; in fact I would argue that we need less. I appreciate the current moderators volunteering their time (and would encourage all users to donate something to them, if they can) but we must ensure the security and freedom of this forum, not leave ourselves open to the possibility of censorship and oppression should the wrong person &#039;get the job&#039; so to speak.

This scam has&nbsp; been going on for a while now (probably longer than I&#039;ve been here, and I&#039;ve been here for approx three weeks), and I&#039;m sure they&#039;re trying their best to rectify the situation, but I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s difficult to on Tor since our IP&#039;s are concealed, if you don&#039;t like it don&#039;t click on it, all newbies should read the sticky that warns them of this scam &#039;Forum Alerts [READ THIS / upd 9/27 7:49 PM UTC]&#039; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=42091.0, they only have themselves to blame if they don&#039;t read the Silk Road discussion stickies before they post for the first time (I ensured I did), I would recommend for everyone to read those stickies, they&#039;re there for a reason, and that is to either update us or protect us&nbsp; :)

				I meant spam modifications, not spam moderators. forum software to handle the spam so that people don&#039;t have to go about deleting post after post by spammers. the first one that comes to mind is the simple captcha to post if you have &lt;say 50 posts. then the spammers would have to key in a captcha for their first 50 spam posts (more if the first 50 get deleted quickly) before they can go on their posting spree. I know banning by IP won&#039;t work, but I think there are some additional MODs (modifications) that can help against the problem. <br /><br />speaking of MODs, I would also like to see one that disables all caps posts (like phpbb has) I hate reading all caps posts, but I guess this hasn&#039;t been a problem lately.

				My statement was that we should be cautious when modifying the forum software. That statement stands for itself. You ask me how anonymity could be compromised. I will answer that by saying that I am not a programmer, and I don&#039;t know how it could be done, but isn&#039;t it safer to be careful than to just add MODs that haven&#039;t been checked for any type of malicious code? the name of this game is safety and security, and that cannot be achieved by simply saying that since we are using Tor, then there is NO way that we can be compromised.<br /><br />or as my grandmother said...&quot;better safe than sorry&quot;

What I didn&#039;t understand is why you made it. You clearly have no idea what you are talking about and yet felt a need to &quot;warn&quot; us on something that CAN NOT HAPPEN! Also lets assume for one second that their modifications could indeed, maybe, put us at risk... Do you think they would make them? <br /><br />Now let us get back to reality... There is NOTHING they could do that would ever put our anonymity at risk here on the forums that we all access through TOR.<br /><br />I am not trying to jump in your ass. But I am trying to make a point that we do not need a member with such high regard as yourself, making post about security in threads that not only have nothing to do with security but in fact your statement is just impossible to happen. It would be like me warning someone about the dangers of flying yet they are walking to the store. And then when someone calls me out like I did you...I say &quot; Should you not be concerned about a plane crashing? And then you say &quot; well I guess except for they are not flying, they are walking and they are in no danger of a plane landing on them. And then I would say &quot; But did you see the episode of shameless?? When the engine fell out of a plane and almost killed William H Macy? <br /><br /><br /><br />At least in my example a plane can actually crash and a falling engine could hit someone. In your &quot;warning&quot; the think you actually said we should be careful about......COULD NEVER HAPPEN.<br /><br /><br />So would it be possible to have a thread on here when some Hero member does not chime in with their security or Leo concerns? <br /><br />Even though since the very beginning of Silk Road there has NEVER been a LE incident or a security breach of any kind!!! <br /><br />I think the worst thing that happened is a vendor got pissed and actually put a customers name and address in the forum. And that might have been in the first 3 months.&nbsp; Yet there is a group of HERO posters (meaning they made over 1000 post..that is how you become a hero member) that in the real world they would be like the group of people that believe that the world is going to end in 2013... Nothing wrong with them at all and most are really smart guys. But they are often throwing&nbsp; out make believe stories that could happen so they have something to talk about.that have never happened and telling stories how you must use pgp when in fact there is no security in pgp at all and the only thing it is good for is if SR gets compromised. The best argument is why not use it as it does&nbsp; not hurt anything and I totally agree&nbsp; yet they tell new members if they do not use it they will not get vended too or if a new vendor wont use it they won&#039;t sell anything. (both of course totally false) I just want a less paranoid, safe road! Nothing more or less!

				High guys might i just suggest the best suggestion to this spam issue and for the spam busters to make schedules for shifts&nbsp; like a night watchman?<br /><br />We do need a couple moderators for the different sections of the forum, like it was originally with me handling the market section and Digital Alch doing the Discussion section and chronic pain in drug safety. That being said it is nearly impossible to find the right type of person to be one of these moderators and believe DPR has a &quot;type&quot;. i know the type and I could select a few with DPR approval to ease the process. Sadly I tried this already back at Christmas and I believe DPR only truly trust himself for such large decisions. As I believe by a recent event that shocked the members of the community. The fact of the matter is you have to have your face in every members business to find these types of ppl DPR can trust as Global Moderators. Dpr doesnt have the time to do that to my knowledge.<br /><br />Imma drop the entries to this post because frankly I&#039;m PMSing I&#039;ve not been mentioned in this thread yet. :P <br /><br />;)<br />nomad bloodbath

Not to shoot you down by any means :P Just making sure we all don&#039;t think this place is perfect and trust it 100%. <br /><br />And I think I may have misunderstood your last comment a bit but hopefully this is still in line with what you&#039;re saying - people around here seem to blindly trust that the title &#039;hero members&#039; or in my case &#039;spam buster&#039; and take it to mean everything they say is gospel. I think a bit of doubt and paranoia in this respect would go a long way. There&#039;s bound to be some snakes in the grass.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok I will address what you said.<br /><br />But first I want to state that though the tone of my post seems like I am attacking ALL hero members or other members that are worrying about security or anything like that..I am not. I am just stating facts, And I can back up every thing I say with facts. My only angel is that I know a lot of buyers come in here and read these type of post and they hit the panic button and believe that there safety is in danger. And the simple truth it is not.<br /><br />I do believe that doing extra things to take precaution or using PGP&nbsp; is a good idea in the sense that all it does is add another layer of security and that can never be a bad thing. And I think we would all agree that everything is just that..an extra layer and that is always good. But nothing is bullet proof. And using PGP is a choice and using it can only help you not hurt you BUT I also know that it really does no good except for in the chance SR get compromised and you want eliminate the chance your address can be on the servers. Even if SR does delete everything and it can not be brought back up ...by using PGP and I mean ALWAYS using it, you can eliminate any chance of something happening. That&#039;s it. It offers no other protection. So I am not against anything at all. Security is good and the more the better..<br /><br />But I can&#039;t stand the post that are made by a group of vendors that range from HERO to&nbsp; ones with 10 post that make threads and post about the security of Silk Road always being in danger. Or making post that are 100% wrong like wretched original post in here that come form a &quot; lets be careful xxx can happen&quot; when in fact xxx can&#039;t. This is an awesome place. We all agree. \\<br /><br />In 1.6+ years there has been nothing. No vendor has been busted because of SR. No buyer has been in trouble. No LE has set up accounts. <br /><br />NOTHING. <br /><br />Those are the facts and I want them talked about not the constant bullshit about this vendor being busted or this vendor being LE. And I can show 100+&nbsp; threads that a main group always post in and 99% of the time talk about and speculate there is a security branch or something like that and they all have proven false and total bullshit.<br /><br />I liken this group to a IRL life group that believes the world is going to end in Dec 2012. Most people IRL believe that group is paranoid and wacky and are a lot like the Y2K group. Ir a better example might be the preparers. Like the TV show. Except for in here because they make a lot of post and have titles like HERO next to there name, new people red these post and take what they say for face value and believe it. Even though it is total bullshit!<br /><br />There is a thread in this forum right now with the title&nbsp; &quot;Honeypot vendor&quot;and you can read for yourself exactly what I am talking about. It is unreal and a perfect example of the bullshit I&nbsp; am talking about. It is right there and black and white. The crazies doing what they do best.. Making up shit and trying to discus a situation that never happened.It is insane. I just want the new and old buyers to realize that Silk Road is a safe place to buy your goodies. Get BTC, use a trusted vendor, place an order, be patient and within a few days you will have your goods. Finalize and enjoy! That is how 99% of the transactions go.<br /><br /><br />Now as to what you said....<br /><br />I look at what you do as working on Silk Road to make&nbsp; it a better experience. I have never really read any of your personal post so I have no opinion on you. I understand exactly what you said and I in no way think you were trying to down me or anything like that. And I am not trying to you...BUT<br /><br />Your first few words is very important....&quot;there&#039;s never been any security breaches&quot;. FACT<br /><br />Then you go on to say.....&quot;there&#039;s certainly been a few things here and there that are quite concerning&quot;<br /><br />&quot;8+ months ago there was something wrong with the search function on SR where something could be typed and it showed encrypted addresses and peoples orders instead of the regular SR page&quot;<br /><br />This has ZERO to do with LE or anything like that... but as you say was, for lack of a better term, a coding issue. That&#039;s it. And SR was not even a year old and like you said it was fixed right away. <br /><br />I hardly think that one thing is in any way even worth mentioning. In fact you saying that... I believe ....even cements that much more what I have posted all along. <br /><br />There has never been a problem with SR. Especially when it comes to LE or anything like that!!<br /><br />I mean in 1.6+ years and all the post that I know you have read, with all of the so called breaches or this person is a LE or that..the facts are as you would 100% agree.....THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE. EVER!<br /><br />And the good news in the last 2 months the usual suspects in this... have kind of been quiet. ;D&nbsp; and that is a good thing!<br /><br />As for your last paragraph... I don&#039;t know what you didn&#039;t understand..and I don&#039;t think it is that big a deal :) <br /><br />But I disagree with your last 2 sentences----&quot;I think a bit of doubt and paranoia in this respect would go a long way. There&#039;s bound to be some snakes in the grass&quot;<br /><br />I do not think paranoia helps in any way at all. And I would be ignorant to believe this is Hawaii and there are no snakes. I just believe in being smart, being cautious, having no paranoia and realizing that even if there are snakes in the grass..they are not black mambas they are gardener snakes. And I as a vendor have 1000x more at risk then 99% of the people in these forums and members of SR. I do not think nothing can happen. But I also do not think every 4th buyer is LE. I do not get paranoid. I get people what they ordered. Very fast. Very stealth. And very safe.<br /><br />I believe the biggest threat is IRL. Not being on here. This is the last place I worry about.<br /><br />I really respect those who want to use all the safety features they want. As I believe the IRL preparers&nbsp; have a right to do what they are. I am on the side that thinks they are crazy and wont ever need it. But It is there choice and god bless them.<br /><br />At the end of the day every one has to do whatever they need to feel safe. Security can&#039;t hurt. I just want people to be honest and not post Bigfoot sightings or about the UFO they might have seen.<br /><br />&nbsp;Post facts.<br /><br /><br />Like you did! One thing happened 8 months ago that had nothing to do with anything other then a software issue. Not bad for 1.8 years.<br /><br />The worst thing I have seen is tony76, all the vendors that require FE, the stupid fucking buyers that can&#039;t spell there name, The bullshit vendors that have zero customer service and don&#039;t take care of their customers, That loser PERKY and the liars in here that try and ruin it for the 99.9% of us that love this place.<br /><br />But 90% of people that purchase on SR do not post in here. The hero members are in no way the voice of the average buyer in here. Though a lot of them 99% are a huge asset in here and really smart. And without them this place would not be what it is. <br /><br />I think all of us want one thing.... To come back as Hugh Hefner<br />
