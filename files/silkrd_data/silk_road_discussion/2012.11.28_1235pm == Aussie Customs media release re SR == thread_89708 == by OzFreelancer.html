				http://www.customs.gov.au/site/silkroadgoal.asp<br /><br />media release<br />Don’t take the Silk Road to gaol<br /><br />Customs and Border Protection continues to actively monitor the so called ‘anonymous’ online drug marketplace Silk Road and, as online discussions show, is disrupting the illegal trade it facilitates.<br /><br />Silk Road is an overseas based illicit e-commerce website which sells drugs and other items prohibited under Australian law.<br /><br />Customs and Border Protection seizes a significant amount of cocaine and MDMA in the international mail stream, which intelligence shows has been purchased through the Silk Road website. These packages may contain only a few grams of an illicit substance, yet our world class detector dogs and cutting edge x-ray technology allow us to identify and seize them.<br /><br />The message is clear to users of Silk Road; even if your package contains a small amount of drugs for personal use, Customs and Border Protection has the ability to detect them and find you, no matter where you are in Australia.<br /><br />Customs and Border Protection works closely with federal and state law enforcement partners, as well as international partner agencies, to share intelligence. This creates a global web of intelligence about known sellers and buyers, a web which gets tighter with every transaction.<br /><br />As a result of the pressure applied by Customs and Border Protection, several ‘anonymous’ Silk Road dealers have announced on forums that they will no longer sell to Australians, or they have imposed more stringent transaction rules on Australian buyers. This demonstrates that Customs and Border Protection is actively disrupting this illegal trade in dangerous drugs.<br /><br />National Manager of the Cargo and Maritime Targeting Branch, John Gibbon, used these recent announcements to warn users of such alleged ‘anonymous’ websites not to jeopardise their future.<br /><br />“Don’t fool yourself that a shipment is too small to warrant further investigation. Illegally importing any amount of a border controlled drug, even for personal use, is taken very seriously,” Mr Gibbon said.<br /><br />“Those who think themselves safe behind an ‘anonymous’ web handle are potentially wasting their money with scammers, and exposing themselves to prosecution. The risk just isn’t worth it.”<br /><br />If you have any information which could help combat drug smuggling, report it to Customs Watch on 1800 06 1800 or report online at http://www.customs.gov.au/customswatch. You can remain anonymous.<br /><br />

				Nice find!<br /><br />Definitely a scare letter, I see absolutely nothing new ;).<br /><br />&gt; Defines Silk Road<br />&gt; We sometimes catch MDMA and coke that comes in. What about the other 4000 drug listings lol.<br />&gt; We have the same dogs &amp; X-Ray as we did last year lolz.<br />&gt; Some old news about web, anonymity, etc etc<br />&gt; Saying UK vendors stopped sending to us for CUSTOMS related reasons when it was in fact more likely to be oz SCAMMERS.<br />&gt; Call this number for info coz we are damn desperate and cannot stop the most elaborate anonymous drug network to ever exist.<br />&gt; The guy they talk about obviously does not know the anonymity of SR. Plus he says websites as plural -&gt; SR is stronger than any clear net website lol.<br /><br /><br />Customs doesn&#039;t look cheap, and I doubt they&#039;re getting any ridiculous new amounts of funding for state of the art X-Rayzzzz.<br /><br /><br /><br />Any Silk Road operations would be useless against buyers given that there are THOUSANDS of buyers.<br />Vendors obviously have potential risks. Imagine trying to pinpoint vendors that randomize drops, blend in with business mail and leave absolutely zero traces, lol.<br /><br />Also, the overseas vendors that have stopped shipping to Oz are of course a combination of both scammers and legitimate confiscations, but more importantly, those transactions were settled thru support and therefore the kid ain&#039;t in jail for losing the drugs and no arrests laid lol. <br /><br />BTW: Aussies never forget who could be Law Enforcement here. Me, the OP, every vendor even..... it ain&#039;t hard to falsify feedback from what we see.<br /><br />Hope everyone gets something outta this xx

				More scare tactics. If they had actually caught anyone then they would have announced that. Plus they have no control at all on domestic mail in Australia and they know it. All they can do is stop a % of international orders.

				Oh, the irony. I&#039;m scared shitless now, I think I will delete my account and never use SR again.<br /><br />How pathetic, they saw they can&#039;t do shit about SR and started throwing statements like:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">“Don’t fool yourself that a shipment is too small to warrant further investigation.

LE, on behalf on SR community I am advising you to start catching the real criminals and the thieves that break countries apart and ruin peoples life.<br /><br />Go fuck yourselves!<br /><br />

				Lol next media snap will go something like:<br /><br />SR vendors beware we now employ a team of highly trained telepathic monkeys, they monitor every single inbound parcel and letter to Australia. They can sense you thinking about the parcel and we will inform the authorities from the originating country. Our monkeys are so advanced that they can even detect 1/2 grams of ketamine in the mail system. <br /><br />Beware, do not buy from silk road, you may become infected with a computer virus and have to go to hospital, The viruses our intelligence has detected on silk road are lethal 99% of the time. <br /><br />

				&nbsp;:o ;D ;) :) ;D &gt;:( :o 8) ??? ::) :P :-X :) ;D 8) :o :o :o :( ??? ;) ;) :) :)<br /><br /><br />They are fighting a war in Afghanistan to bring &quot;freedom&quot; to people that never asked them for it, but if it&#039;s their own people, you can be rest assured they will try to make you believe everything you know to be a lie at the threats of violence against yourself or your loved ones. <br /><br />Even worse, by protecting you from yourself by throwing you into a small cage with hardened criminals but at the same time tell you it&#039;s for your own good.<br /><br />You see people what this is called is The State! <br /><br />A State based on theft, torture, lies, cowardess, ignorance, despair, greed, opportunism, stupidity, Fascism, hypocrisy, barbarism, conformity, discontent, chaos, pain, submission, the Elite, false promises/dreams, suffering, fear and everything else that is the result of a dictatorial world government known as the United Nations and the people that serve them.<br /><br />To all LE out there, you people treat us a criminals when it is you, who are the ones who are the perpetrators and instigators of this aggressive, uncivilized and insane war against us who pay taxes in the belief that you are there to Serve And Protect and not To Punish and Enslave us as the motto goes in the Transformers movie. Do you suppose there was a subliminal message in there LE as to why it was the Police car that had that slogan on it&#039;s sides? The movie itself sucked balls and was a huge disappointment to those of us brought up in an era before shameless product placement, and was an advertising nightmare that was really just another example of everything that is wrong in today&#039;s society.<br /><br />Yet you people have the gaul to accuse us of being &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;sick&quot; or the ones I love the best Weiner, an appropriate name for the former head of the White House Drug &quot;Czar&#039;s&quot; Office, said that they were &quot;getting more of the SLIME off our streets&quot; and even more humorous, that smoking cannabis was the number two cause of car crashes (in the Penn And Teller War On Drugs BULLSHIT Episode, ;-)). Great show!<br /><br />We just love being dehumanized and thrown in concentration camps for our beliefs and believing we should have the right to act on those beliefs provided we cause no ill will toward another, it&#039;s funny how soon we forget what freedoms we supposedlyu fought the Nazi&#039;s for that coincidentally would not be throwing us in prison for posession of any drug. If you are LE reflect on it&#039;s not actually us (aside from the cartels you force into being illegal and go to war against) who are the dangerous, vindictive and cruel people who want to impose our will onto others, but in fact these are your actions. We just want to be left alone to conduct free trade, get bent every now and again and do our best to help leave this world in a better way than we found it, and when you arrest us and ruin our employment prospects with criminal records and worse, you make real criminals out of previously decent citizens who are then driven into a life of crime. The same thing goes by making essentially worthless commodities worth 1000&#039;s of times their real value causing junkies to rob people in order to feed their habit, as meth in Australia now is $700+ a gram on the street and you wonder why you have a crime problem, a crime problem BTW which you guys created by persecuting much safer compounds like MDMA with faulty data now debunked long ago and continue to feed by giving what is essentially for all intents and purposes a poison. <br /><br />However it&#039;s not up to us to decide what our fellow creatures can and can&#039;t do with their anatomies but up to us to help them. We really have to say what is it about our world that is so bad, or rather these peoples worlds, that are so bad as to make them want to do that all the time like they were in the 60 Minutes &quot;Ice Age&quot; doco.<br /><br />Certainly there was a lot of sensationalism in that 60 minutes documentary as in many things they do since you can have a meth habit and be the No1 tennis player in the world for years and Andrew Johns didn&#039;t just take ecstasy he was hitting the pipe too for sure. I have met people who would use meth when we would go out at an after party to keep partying on and go to work Monday as accountants and lawyers, but at the &quot;Ice Age&quot; end of the spectrum these people need serious help and it&#039;s sad that it would take other illicit drugs like mushrooms or DMT to make them see what&#039;s wrong with their lives and make them reflect that they&#039;re killing themselves. However we should never force another fellow creature at the end of a gun what to do with their lives or what to pu into themselves. <br /><br />However... lurking somewhere in a political or law enforcement office somewhere there&#039;s been a man who been up since 5am busily working away trying to catch pedophiles, he&#039;s on a team of about 20 people. Meanwhile we devote trillions each year to stop adults from doing something to themselves they clearly enjoy. This unwinnable and psychologically devoid of any logical thought war on drugs is being fuelled by the same hatred and ignorance inside Christians that makes them hate Palestinians, it&#039;s the same hatred that makes Black Panthers and the KKK hate each other... IGNORANCE AND BIGOTRY! <br /><br />As you sit there and smoke your bong, or crack pipe (you may not be able to ponder this if you&#039;re a crackhead and if so I&#039;m sorry) but there are millions and millions of people or it may be billions, somewhere, who either never got laid or has a religious doctrinal belief system or is just a plain power junkie, who thinks they know what is better for your life than you do and as a so called &quot;free&quot; adult they ALLOW you to have SOME &quot;rights&quot; but rights aren&#039;t rights if they can just be taken away by someone at any time they choose, when you have done nothing to them or anyone else. As every religion, government and major corporation has blood on it&#039;s hands how can they continue to commit atrocities against innocent people? What drives a person to be that brain washed? The saddest thing too as someone who&#039;s smoked DMT is that these people voluntarily will deny themselves the most astounding thing that will ever happen that it will change their lives more in 5 minutes than anything prior to that, and afterward they would spread that love to the rest of society that&#039;s sick.<br /><br />The biggest cause of unnatural deaths in the 20th Century wasn&#039;t, drugs, or automobile accidents, or people falling off ladders, it was STATE FORCED WAR AND GULAGS!!!<br /><br />If you are reading this anywhere in this world right now, the comedian Dylan Moran when he toured Australia a couple of years made a joke about how Australia is essentially a jail, or as it&#039;s spelled there &quot;gaol&quot;, and the audience just laughed it off without giving it a second thought, when he wasn&#039;t ACTUALLY JOKING at all.<br /><br />We live in a land with a parliamentary system that is essentially what&#039;s known as a Left/Right paradigm, and it is this two party system that holds up the ruling power structures who dictate to the two parties which policies they want pushed through. There is an excellent Alex Jones (I know he&#039;s crazy but this is good and short) video on YouTube explaining this further.<br /><br />This system is hopelessly outdated and we need HUGE reforms in our system of government and above all REAL RIGHTS that protect the individual and his property rights against anyone including, unless under exceptional circumstances, the State. <br /><br />If you have a system that is supposed to be fair, where 49% tell 51% how to live their lives, and then when this so called elected government gets into power quite often making large promises they break (GST, Carbon Tax, Challenging K-Rudd for example) then you ought to lose your job for lying to your employers, the Australian people. <br /><br />Furthermore, we would like to insist that if you wish to test mine and other civic workers urine or hair samples as part of your Drug Nazi Gestapo Movement, and will try and ruin our livelihoods if in our free time we alter our state of mind in the non-governmental approved fashion, then so to should ALL politicians be subjected to and indeed forced by random computer selection to submit tests for analysis at question time as we are on the job site. Nobody I know who does drugs goes to work under their influence, I&#039;m sure it happens but it would be seldom and those people would go to work on anything they obviously could legal or otherwise. People don&#039;t even know there&#039;s psychedelic plants that are legal everywhere you could use to get high, even nutmeg if you have about ten grams or more will have you tripping.<br /><br />I wonder if your drugs attitude then when you feel how violating and degrading it is, to not only submit bodily fluids to a foreign person you don&#039;t know, but also that attitude toward an employee that&#039;s giving his all for a company is too stupid not to show up to work sober is repugnant to say the least.<br /><br />An employer, who suspects an employee of not being sober ought to give them a warning or two then either be legally allowed to take them (with full pay until guilty) to a hospital because we all agree certain jobs require a sober mind, but a responsible person knows this and a responsible employer knows their employees and if their sober one would also think.<br /><br />END PROHIBITION, WE DON&#039;T WANT TO BE YOUR ENEMIES IT IS YOU WHO BY MAKING THING THAT AREN&#039;T CRIMES INTO CRIMES, THAT THEREFORE MAKE REAL CRIMINALS!<br /><br />We&#039;re not stupid and most of us want to see the youth educated and meth addicts cleaned up and you need to end the stigmatization of these things so people aren&#039;t ashamed to get help and if they don&#039;t want it, and hurt nobody else, then leave them alone you can not change people through use of deadly violence and threats of dehumanization, or the resistance will grow to where those who enforced these laws by &quot;just doing their jobs&quot; will be treated like Nuremberg war criminals.<br /><br />We in the Libertarian Movement or what we call the rEVOLution (Love-olution) from now retired hero of the movement, Dr Ron Paul, to such persecuted people as Mark Emery (who was extradited to the US for something that was not even a crime in Canada to a country who just legalized it completely in two states) or Julian Assange, to the young person who&#039;s had their lives destroyed by the State demand an End To Violent Autocratic Rule Everywhere. Peoples lives are continuously ruined, not by the drugs they were consuming or selling, but because the very government that was there to protect their right to be free instead chose to make them into slaves because they disagreed with their master, and they metaphorically (or not so, depending on your viewpoint) ate from the Tree Of Knowledge and tasted the flavors of our species development.<br /><br />What does it say if the bullshit story of Adam And Eve were true, and God couldn&#039;t keep something freely available prohibited from two people, that he made, what does that say about human nature?<br /><br />Police don&#039;t seem to understand they would save so much resources they could actually use to something beneficial, save lives and prevent poverty and above all get RESPECT from the community at large if they were only given the RESPECT in return to conduct themselves as they please, provided they harm no one but themselves. <br /><br />The biggest thing they would find is drugs would lose their value, but more importantly and this applies particularly to the younger more curious and less disciplined of our society, the allure that drug&#039;s are somehow &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;bad ass&quot;. Next thing you know they&#039;re hooked on meth which is a shitty shitty drug when compared to good MDMA or DMT and is the real substance they used in that &quot;Your Brain on XTC&quot; NIDA propaganda campaign that coincidentally scared many people off MDMA to of all things... fucking meth!<br /><br />If you really want to make a difference, and you&#039;re an Australian citizen (personally I see myself as Stateless but we all want to make changes) join Australia&#039;s ONLY Libertarian Party the Liberal Democratic Party and make your voice heard and it&#039;s free online here: www.ldp.org.au (no this isn&#039;t some phishing scam) and I also suggest you listen to Russia Today for your world news and AdamVSTheMAN isn&#039;t too bad... also the Joe Rogan Experience.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister claims to be an Atheist, but you could never be an Atheist and prosecute other fellow creatures for being themselves and providing other fellow creatures something they require... SHE IS A NEO STATIST FASCIST PUPPET PEOPLE!<br /><br />Vote Liberal Democrat or...<br /><br />Welcome to 1984 bitches!

Perhaps not too far in the future, there will come a time when we are as free with our bodies and minds as we can possibly become without government or individual coercion through the threat of force and violence. There is a War For Civilization, and the war on drugs is equal to importance as the war on religious nonsense stunting our species further development. Make no mistake, they are one and the same. I hope to see it in my lifetime which is faster and faster coming to an end. <br /><br />When America has legalized before a former convict colony there is some serious flaws in logic there when it was they, if I&#039;m not, mistaken who made the world sign the UN drugs act but even prior to that convinced our good ol&#039; boys to follow everything they do<br /><br />Half the reason the Western world is so sad is people have lost their sense of freedom and individual liberty and have instead submitted their will, and therefore their sense of purpose, to serving a system that not only despises them as much as it does the next man, but when you subordinate yourself to anything it takes away ones sense of self worth and you become dis-empowered. The fanfare of the belief in a real Change with Obama in 2008 was a manifestation of our species repressed desire for Liberation but also an example of a pathetic image of what Christians call &quot;the flock&quot;. People are all looking for someone to lead them to true Freedom in the sense that they see the impact in their daily lives and all the while Obama smiles and acts cool, he continues to destroy the osul of humanity and our Prime Minister is under the same Prime Directive you could say.<br /><br />The best person&nbsp; (it should have been Ron Paul) the Republican party put up, out of 300,000,000 was a literal Mormon High Priest that while he was debating Obama had on and does at all times, magic underpants.<br /><br />The family first senator in Australia is a young Earth Creationist who believes the worlds 6000years old and actually said it to Richard Dawkins on Q&amp;A. You can see it on YouTube! My point is these are the people dictating to us how to live and there comes a time when we need to get organized and push back against this same superstitious bullshit that started religion also drives the war on drugs, it&#039;s a War On Reason World Wide!<br /><br />Ultimately my friends, comrades, brothers and sisters, LEO&#039;s and politicians can not admit all these years they were doing the wrong thing based on lies and faulty data ,and that is I believe the main contributing factor to this whole issue when it comes to prosecuting the war on drugs. I personally would much rather see my tax dollars going to catching wildlife smugglers and preventing insects that could destroy our fauna than stopping someone or persons unknown willingly getting high. Without the drug war customs would be able to better stop illicit firearms (that all law abiding citizens should be allowed to own) <br /><br />Another thing is people in politics and LEO&#039;s/Customs officials have made this their whole lives existence and meaning to prosecute and carry out this homicidal campaign and if you take that away from them and set the people free they (wrongfully) jailed, it will be like taking away their whole reason for existence (which is more pathetic than a drug habit itself IMO).<br /><br />These people need to take a good hard look at themselves and the implications of their actions and instead of ruining peoples Christmas and/or NY&#039;s celebrations by stopping their blow or MDMA, save some endangered species that are locked in a suitcase somewhere and train dogs to sniff out different types of explosives instead of different types of drugs.<br /><br />HACK THE PLANET AND LIVE FREE!!!<br /><br />Peace brother - regards JWM

				I actually thought OzFreelancer was a cop for a full minute and then noticed the little &quot;media release&quot; on top. My bad. <br /><br />The Australian authorities have a tendency to bullcrap and intimidate every 30 seconds or so because they don&#039;t have any evidence of anything.... they don&#039;t know squat. If they don&#039;t even know what country it&#039;s run (&quot;overseas based illicit commerce&quot;) they&#039;re a little behind the eight-ball. (btw, that&#039;s not how jail is spelt. Dickheads.) <br /><br />&quot;...a significant amount of cocaine and MDMA...&quot; is probably not significant or they&#039;d cite the actual amount, and &quot;intelligence shows has been purchased through the Silk Road website&quot; is probably more garbage as it would have resulted in an arrest, laid charges, and national headlines. (Whether or not you agree with me, I can assure you the first real arrest (Ryan West doesn&#039;t count) of a SR vendor or buyer would be gleefully broadcast. SR is hot right now, because it&#039;s &#039;the one that got away,&#039; and that makes cops look dumb. My mistake. I mean, even dumber.) The billions of dollars spent every year (I forget the precise amount, it&#039;s in my Reader and it will take too long to find) on security infrastructure to combat terrorism isn&#039;t worth a cent. I think that&#039;s extremely cool, and a little embarrassing.<br /><br />&quot;...This demonstrates that Customs and Border Protection is actively disrupting this illegal trade in dangerous drugs....&quot; It sure does. I&#039;ve noticed a steady increase in logged users on SR forums alone. They don&#039;t seem to realise that these little exposes on Silk Road generate a noticeable increase in members as people find us &#039;just to have a look&#039; and then when they realise how goddamn cool this little operation is and they can do it with relative anonymity and getting shot, knifed or busted by cop, they decide to stay. Way to go Australian Customs, you just provided SR with invaluable advertising. Dickheads.<br /><br />Unless there&#039;s somebody visiting Silk Road on the regular surface web via onion.to, they should be reasonably safe I suspect. Especially if they use bridges. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=89708.msg633628#msg633628">Quote from: chilled on November 29, 2012, 04:22 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=89708.msg632325#msg632325">Quote from: OzFreelancer on November 28, 2012, 12:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If you have any information which could help combat drug smuggling, report it to Customs Watch<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I believe I have valuable information concerning the biggest import/export agency of illegal drugs, in the entire world.

I peed a little. I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s the same in the U.S., but in AU we have a wee bit of a problem with corruption in the police force when it comes to drugs. Ever notice how carefully they they seize the marijuana (or whatever) and cart it from the premises, and shortly after there&#039;s an inexplicable theft from the evidence lockers and it&#039;s suddenly back on the streets from police channels which in turn leads to more busts in another 6 months? Don&#039;t pee on my leg and call it water. <br /><br />As sure as I can be sure of anything I know there has to be at least a few LEs monitoring this site, posing as legitimate buyers or sellers. Could be me for all you know. But at this stage, if we all stick to the rules we should okay. I have to order a pizza now, but I&#039;ll be back later. Piece.
