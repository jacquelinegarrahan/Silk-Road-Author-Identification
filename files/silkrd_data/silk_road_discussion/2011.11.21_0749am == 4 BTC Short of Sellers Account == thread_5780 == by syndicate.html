			<dd class="postbody">
				I would like to create a sellers account to begin the sale of 30MG Adderall XR at a better going rate than the current prices, as well as Lunesta 1 &amp; 3mg (eszopiclone), among a few others.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I did not deposit enough, and decided I would just ask the community (as I am sure some of you are interested in better prices on Adderall XR) if anyone would help me out with 3-4 BTC, to bring my balance above its current 64.90 so that I may register for a sellers account and get started right away.<br /><br />If anyone would be willing to help out with this, I&#039;d send a few samples and also pay back your BTC after my first sale.<br /><br />If this is against forum rules, I sincerely apologize and will not post again if removed.<br /><br />Thanks all!

				Thanks you guys, I don&#039;t think I have ever been involved in such a generous community, its great to know that there are people here willing to help others with things like this, it gives me a lot of faith in seeing SR succeed :-)<br /><br />My username on the forums is the same as my username on SR (syndicate).<br /><br />I now currently have about 62 BTC available, and a sellers account is going for about 67.00 BTC, so any help there would be greatly appreciated, and I will definitely send out a couple samples as soon as I get started!<br /><br />I really look forward to serving this community in the coming days!
