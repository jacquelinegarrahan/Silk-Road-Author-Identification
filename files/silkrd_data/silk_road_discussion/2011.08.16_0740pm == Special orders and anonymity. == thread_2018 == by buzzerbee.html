				So here&#039;s the thing, some SR sellers will put up special orders for a buyer which is great.&nbsp; The problem with this is when someone says something like &quot;Special Order for buzzbee&quot;.&nbsp; This has never happened to me, but using my forum name as an example.&nbsp; I would suggest anyone putting up a special order item to use something other than the buyers user id to describe the item, perhaps call it &quot;Special Order 123456&quot; or something else OTHER than the buyers ID.&nbsp; It would be pretty easy to guess what a user is buying in that special order based on the fact that most sellers deal with one particular item, some with a small variety.&nbsp; Just makes sense to keep your customers anonymous and avoid problems.&nbsp; Here is an example of WHY to keep user ID&#039;s out of special orders:<br /><br />LE sells some stuff to a number of people, perhaps not for a bust but for info gathering.&nbsp; Now LE watches SR and happens to notice the user ID of one of the people it has sent items to appears in a special order, so they look at what the seller is offering for sale and at what price, then they easily guess what that user ID mentioned in the special order is buying.&nbsp; So for example, they guess a pound of weed is being sent to that same ID then they can easily focus in on the address a package is going to.&nbsp; In fact that would probably be enough evidence for LE to get a warrant to open mail destined to that address.&nbsp; It&#039;s going to be small things like this that will snag people and their &quot;special orders&quot;.<br /><br /><br />

				I have also wondered this. Will LE actually send out 1/8th of whatever just to collect the address? I have seen several vendors that take lots of orders but never deliver, I can only assume that they are LE and are trying to profile with their addresses that they are collecting. can see them advertising and taking the order but I dont see them actually delivering it. Maybe im wrong. But, I think they would be breaking tons of laws on their own, if they were to do that (Yes, I realize that they break laws every day and not care). Even when they bust someone face to face, they never let the perp take the stash and let them smoke it and then grab em.<br /><br />Also, I know that people change their username on the market about as many times as I change my depends underwear on a daily basis. It literally takes 10 seconds to make a new account and xfer btc into it. I know it says that there are 44k users on the market, but if there are 5k active unique users, I would be very surprised.

				I suggest to put info in item description.<br />For vendors who have not delivered many order is now easy to undurstund what was going on.<br />That happen before when scammers did know how SR escrow really works. So they started to sell something what they did not have and hoping that there is a way to relesa some amount of btc or chance to go outside an escrow or even that somebody will finalize before delivery.<br />Other is simply non respnasable vendors who have not pay for sellers account.<br />And finnaly, address in LE posesion is not enough for nothing because there is no evidence to point real person as a buyer behind that address. Other problem is juridiction and small amounts of drugs.

				Can all ways make a new options when making the listing that make it private where it dose not show up.<br />So a seller make the listing as private dose not show up so seller send link to buyer. a seller can all ways just get the link form the account settings on main site.

				buzzbee,<br />maybe because of my shity english and lack of vocabular you meant that I complain towards your post, when that is not true.<br />I agree on you when say that vendor do not put buyers name in title of special listing, I do that in item description and suggest all other vendors to do the same.<br />Other thing about LE and phising addreses is solely my opinion, nothing more and nothing less, but we do not know anything for a fact and wild speculations is not good.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And don&#039;t think for a second that LE will not do something to someone just to show an example.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You assumption - maybe dangerus on spreading panic!<br /><br />Anyhow, I can not say anything as I do not live in U.S. so do not take my point to much credit only stand as an opinion. I see many members here freaking out before knowing anything for sure and that only bring more posts with freaking out mentality. But you or me can not do much about it or why we should? That comes with territory dealing with illegal activity.<br /><br />We have two type of buyers;<br />1. Who have never have anything with Police, no interview , clean record.<br />2. Who had some &quot;problems&quot; with police and court of law.<br /><br />To first; welcome to the game, nobody force you to start buying drugs and having possibility to having something with LE.<br />To second, they already knows how things works.

				Mseller, perhaps complaint is a poor choice of word to describe your post.&nbsp; Not meaning to spread panic, no no no, but it is a bit naive to not think about possible investigative procedures.&nbsp; &nbsp;But if people are putting up special orders which for example say in the description &quot;For buzzbee, one pound of weed&quot; is not good.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll refer back to the example I had in my OP.&nbsp; It would be very easy for LE to figure out who is buying weed, whether it be through fake sale posts of small sales to gather addresses.&nbsp; Sure, seeing some special order posting for a particular user and knowing the address that a particular user has is not probable cause or anything like that, but it does allow further investigation, perhaps focusing in on packages destined for an address, run more tests on them or have a dog sniff them to get enough evidence to allow opening of packages.&nbsp; To me I think it is common sense that the less someone knows the better.

LE can set up a seller account and harvest addresses; even though nothing is ever sent, the &quot;seller&quot; gets a list of buyers and each buyer&#039;s address. Then when LE sees a special order for a buyer they have in their database, they know to check the mail for that buyer.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve ever ordered from a seller who never delivered and later was tagged as a scammer, you may have had your address &quot;harvested,&quot; and you may want to have all future orders sent to another address.

				I agree but what to do?<br />I am doing like this, I inform particular buyer that I will make special listing just for him and with quantity 1, Title: -custom listing- buyer username is in desctiption, nothing else, who mentioned put one pound of weed??&nbsp; maybe to put some other passphrase... So buyer ASAP after my pm go to purchase that item and item dissapear from section. That way special listing is only visible short period of time. Maybe even we could make special section just for special listings..

				I agree, very similar to my listing. I do not include in description goods only username.<br />Username can not be used in search mode and if that is only info you can not send him a pm. (If that username have not active listings, of course buyers should change usernames often)<br />For that you need ID number.
