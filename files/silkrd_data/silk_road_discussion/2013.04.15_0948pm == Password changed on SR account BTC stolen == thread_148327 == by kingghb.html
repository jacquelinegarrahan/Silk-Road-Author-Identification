				So on Friday, I tried logging into my SR account, my password had been changed. I immediately messaged SR support. It took until today (3 days later) that my account was finally reset. When I got back in I see that luckily the small amount of BTC i kept in my account 1.03BTC wast transferred on (4/15/13 8:59PM). I may have at some point months ago, accidentally put my username/password into a phishing site but NEVER gave my pin. I don&#039;t know if someone seriously brute forced my pin for the 1.03BTC or what but this could have been resolved had my password been reset earlier.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				In order for anyone to transfer btc on SR, they would need your PIN.&nbsp; Are you sure you haven&#039;t entered it anywhere?<br /><br />Because at this point, you&#039;re saying someone knew your password AND your PIN ... which would be difficult for anyone to guess.

				Scout like I said I never gave it out to anyone, my computers are clean of all malware. I think months ago I may have accidentally hit a phishing site because it said I couldn&#039;t login. Anyway, I only use particular passwords for these types of sites but i have no idea what happend but I do know I didn&#039;t give a pin. That&#039;s why i asked about the PIN being BF&#039;ed

Anyhow, I guess more than anything, people be careful if for some reason you lose your link to SR. Now I know what the .onion address looks like so it&#039;s very unlikely this would happen again. I guess really a 4 digit PIN wouldn&#039;t take long to brute force even through tor, but I would think SR would automatically lock out for an elapsed period of time under these conditions.

				Yeah, no kidding. I guess the word &quot;PIN&quot; is so widely used (and usually 4 digits) that he just assumed that was the way it was here, too. Make it long and complex, man. Letters and numbers.

				Regardless of if it was 1234 or 0000 doesn&#039;t matter, it&#039;s only a possibility of what? 256 combinations?

				Either way. Lesson learned. I&#039;m pretty damn sure it was brute forced. 256, 10,0000 either way depending on what beginning number they started with it wouldn&#039;t&#039; take very long. apparently it took 2 days for them to transfer the BTC. From now on I&#039;d use at least a 6-9 digit pin.

				This might be a good time to change the nomenclature of the PIN. I think most people think &quot;4 digit numeric&quot; when they see PIN, and possibly fishers are using that to their advantage.<br /><br />Maybe &quot;Secondary Password&quot; or &quot;Withdrawal Password&quot;?

				By the way, no it wasn&#039;t brute forced.<br /><br />The system allows you 5 failed pin attempts before it freezes your pin.<br /><br />Most likely scenario is that you entered your pin in the phishing page as well as your password -- all the phishing sites ask for pin.
