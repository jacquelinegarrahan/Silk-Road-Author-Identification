				FFS Perky, at least put a little imagination into your scams!&nbsp; ;D Also, you may want to take a course in English, because everybody can spot your posts a mile away. &quot;OMG WTF LOL LMAO HAVE TO LEAVE SR JESUS MOTHERFUCK PARANOID COPS COMING AH!&quot; - give it a rest already.<br /><br />You registered the above account today for this exact purpose.<br />If you can produce a piece of paper for me that proves your IQ is above 60, I&#039;ll give you 100 BTC / $1100 USD, how&#039;s that? And that&#039;s a promise. If you can produce a verifiable IQ test that states you have a modicum of intelligence, you won&#039;t need to try and scam people.<br />Doesn&#039;t get any easier than that, kid.&nbsp; ;)
