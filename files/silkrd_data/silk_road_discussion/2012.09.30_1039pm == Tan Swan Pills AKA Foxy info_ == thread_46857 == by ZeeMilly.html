				Ok, So I was buying from a girl this weekend, I was on molly but looking for rolls (actual pressed pills) to take home with me and was hoping to run into the blue Defkon&#039;s or thumbs up, or No1&#039;s..... She had Swan&#039;s (tan pills, swan on front and a large X on the back used for splitting the tablet) She explained that they were MDMA of great quality so I got like 13 of them because i rarely get out and thought I would stock up. <br />So now I&#039;m home, researched my score and realized what I bought is classified as not as MDMA but as &quot;Foxy&quot; which is an interesting cocktail of:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Benocyclidine: 4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Caffeine: 4 More info<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5-MeO-DiPT: 2 More info<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MDPV: 1 More info<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MDMA: trace More info<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TFMPP: trace<br /><br />A friend I met at the show had one and described it as &quot;real fast, trippy but not too visual, body buzzing, and good&quot; And he was sweating, googlie-eyed.<br /><br />1. I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with these specific pills - please give your review.<br />2. I&#039;m new here and don&#039;t see a way for me to be a vendor. Since I was looking for Ecstacy, I want to sell off or trade all but 2 of them (DMT, Defqon MDMA, MDA, LSD, 2CB) got any info on how to do that? Two way Bitcoin exchange or something? <br /><br />Thanks everyone.<br /><br />*ZM<br />

				It&#039;s the 5-MeO-DiPT that&#039;s known as Foxy, if I remember right it&#039;s supposed to make you real horny. I&#039;ve had it&#039;s sister Moxy (5-MeO-MiPT) which had great euphoria and visual elements.<br /><br />Regardless, I wouldn&#039;t want to ingest those pills. Benocyclidine = nasty. MDPV = nasty. TFMPP = nasty. Caffeine = unwanted. But that&#039;s just my opinion.
