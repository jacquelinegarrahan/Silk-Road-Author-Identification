				If any of you guys have seen The Wire, in Season 3, the police department of Baltimore decide to section off an area of the city where drug dealing and prostitution are legal. This in turn concentrates all the drugs into one area and cleans up the neighborhood, as well as getting rid of the majority of drug related violence.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking, maybe Silkroad is America&#039;s &quot;Hamsterdam&quot; (the name of that particular street in The Wire). This place makes buying drugs easy and safe; how many murders and muggings and overdoses has Silkroad prevented through its existence alone? How much money and manpower has Silkroad saved for law enforcement? A shitload, I bet.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure that, behind all the bullshit, the people who run this country realize quite clearly that the drug war has been a failure. Maybe allowing Silkroad to exist is a way of psuedo-legalization, but without the mass protests from the sheep that make up the majority of the population if legalization was officially legislated.<br /><br />What do y&#039;all think?

				I wouldn&#039;t be too positive about this idea.. If anything I bet SR&#039;s openness and audacity *really* pisses off a lot of those zealous DEA folks. Probably drives them up the wall that there&#039;s this burgeoning public drug market, using their government post system, and they can&#039;t do anything about it..

				I want to challenge this idea that the people in charge are somehow reasonable and know really that the drug war doesn&#039;t work and that we aren&#039;t harming anyone..<br /><br />NO.. I think that they are literally fucking insane. They DO believe in the drug war. They GENUINELY think that we are a threat to their &quot;clean&quot; society. And they WILL try to shut us down, because SR is a big fuck you to the governments of this world and in the end, governments always try to silence dissent. <br /><br />They WILL try to shut us down.

				I believe that you are correct. The Road has prevented a lot of violence regarding street level dealers and has saved many people from wrongly getting dangerous chemicals. Many people are still supporting violence and cartels in many cases when they buy certain products though. But regardless, that problem cannot be solved through a website. It has still made the end sale of the product in question much safer.

				I think that the fact that the war on drugs is failing doesn&#039;t mean anything, because the government wants to keep drugs illegal for totally different reasons.<br /><br />The Silk Road will come under fire when governments have a reason to do so. In the US, I can say that a main reason for trying to get SR shut down would be to gather a favorable publicity from the public and the media, or if the public and the media are causing certain elected officials to have negative publicity for not going after the Silk Road.<br /><br />Other obvious reasons are if the existence of the Silk Road is somehow threatening some other institution who the elected officials benefit from.

				Maybe Silk Road just needs to become so successful and widespread that most drug users in the world buy on silk road. I mean millions of people. If the world tunes in to silk road maybe the police and society at large will finally come to terms with the fact the drug laws are unenforceable. As of today the DEA only claims to stop 5% of all drug trafficking in the United States.

				- tons on drugs get thru successfully every year<br />&nbsp; UK :- &quot;Huge increase in the amount of cocaine seized at British border as customs officers recover more in the past six months than in the whole of 2010<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1 tonnes of the Class A drug recovered between April and September<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Haul boosted by single seizure of 1.2 tonnes of pure cocaine on board a luxury yacht in Southampton<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Success follows damaging revelations that senior officials relaxed vital border checks over the summer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Figures also show amount of heroin trafficked into the UK from Pakistan has increased&quot;<br /><br />- so SR is a shoe box sized sweet shop in comparison.<br /><br />- the above is just UK ALONE, imagine north america?!<br /><br />- i wouldn&#039;t want to insult DPR and suggest some higher LE has an interest in SR, just based on raw stats above its clear where the real money is being made and<br />&nbsp; pretty obvious some top brass are getting back handers to turn a blind eye...cos if 3 tonnes is confiscation imagine whats getting thru&#039;.<br /><br />- SR could be a target on the latest &#039;Operation&#039; to set an example and would be politically motivated, depends on quite a few factors : how much SR rubs LE face<br />&nbsp; in it, how much publicity it generates which the public then expect action on, any kids who die as a result of buying off SR, amt of drugs are discovered by LE which<br />&nbsp; they pin on SR, quantity&nbsp; of drugs LE are able to order and get thru the &#039;channels&#039; successfully -reflects on SR success rate and &#039;size&#039; -again puts pressure on auth<br />&nbsp; to clamp down and probably try put SR out of business.<br /><br />&nbsp; so its a difficult balance to maintain or how far to push it, its down to strategic, if the right bits aren&#039;t in place it more prone to imploding / self destruct, SR must be a<br />&nbsp; stressful / busy operation to keep afloat.<br /><br />- there are a bunch of ideas to distribution which would be nice to tryout but not giving LE / BBC here for free .....hehe<br /><br />

				In my city in Canada there was a block that used to be full of sketchy dealers who would fight all the time, rob customers and were a nightmare for the police.

				The fake store guy&#039;s are clever and somehow manage to sell to a hundred people a day yet never keep more than personal amounts lying around, so if the police do bust the place it&#039;s pointless no trafficking amounts. As they are criminals with a hierarchy, the lowest jr member cops to the drugs and serves a petty week long sentence if anything should they get busted. The senior guy&#039;s with the money walk every time.<br /><br />Cops are mainly complaint driven, so if nobody complains they won&#039;t do anything. If there&#039;s visible street dealing the mayor obviously wants it eliminated so they go after them. If it&#039;s out of sight out of mind, nobody complains, cops don&#039;t care. There was a guy on here once claiming to be an ex cop who said never say what area/city you deliver from in your advertisements. If the local police think you&#039;re international there&#039;s no point in them wasting resources to go after you they don&#039;t have the funds<br /><br />

				It&#039;s obvious that politicians realize that the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; has failed but keeping it going serves too many interests. For example, the pharma companies that produce methadone and other addict replacements, it keeps 5-O employed, it gets votes, it gives the people in power a path to direct &quot;the Mob&#039;s&quot; hate down, it allows governments to exorcise control over lesser nations (look at the U.S&#039;s relationship with Mexico and the rest of Latin America) the list really does go on and on. <br /><br />At the OP I wouldn&#039;t get too complacent about what LE thinks of SR. It probably makes them quite uncomfortable actually. If you think about it this place has about 16000 users, over that now actually. Compare that with the huge open air gun markets in the tribal areas of Pakistan that supply the Taliban and Al Quieda (dunno how to spell it, my bad) and tell me what the difference is? The only differences are that this is in cyber space and drugs are used by millions whereas those gun markets are IRL and supply terrorists that oppose Western culture. Which is more dangerous? Which will get more priority?<br /><br />

				Well said my friend.<br /><br />When I was at college in the UK the council and police created a &quot;toleration zone&quot; in the city where I lived (a very large city by British standards!) This was done to contain prostitution mainly but it was generally understood there was drug use going on.<br /><br />Crime plummeted in that area and indeed all around the city. The girls who worked the streets were able to do so more safely as Social Workers and Doctors would regularly visit the area to make sure they were there of their own free will and were in good health. People who had a moral aversion to that type of thing knew where not to go&nbsp; - people who were OK with it knew where to go!<br /><br />Then as often happens there was a shift of power in government and the Council rather highhandedly decided prostitution was immoral and degrading to women and abolished the zone, to the extent that crime of course returned to its old levels.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17753.msg179957#msg179957">Quote from: mdmamail on April 06, 2012, 10:36 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In my city in Canada there was a block that used to be full of sketchy dealers who would fight all the time, rob customers and were a nightmare for the police.

				This Hamsterdam idea is certainly an interesting take but I don&#039;t believe that the government is simply allowing us to operate simply to clean up their streets.&nbsp; I find the more likely reason to be that the government simply lacks the resources and ability to shut down SR, otherwise most everyone (buy, selling, and operating) on this site would be in handcuffs.

				SR is like any other commercial enterprise, it will survive so long as it can adapt to market conditions and can secure it&#039;s place a needed service. Only difference with SR is that security is a major factor in the adapting side of it and not just the need to expand it&#039;s corporate hold. <br /><br />No need to over complicate and over analyze what SR is/what it means etc because fundamentally the laws of the market are universal, it&#039;s just that different market sectors work differently. <br /><br />For example McDonald&#039;s absolutely no different to lets say the Colombian drug cartels. They both globally network a product via a network of distribution centers that run semi-autonomously under an established brand. Only difference is that one product is cocaine and one is the Big Mac, the former is outside of the law and the latter is inside of it. Ironically though they are both shit for your health. <br /><br />ECONOMICS 101 MOTHA FUCKAS! ;)

SR is not McDonald&#039;s the Latin American cartels can be compared to McDonald&#039;s. <br /><br />SR basically this place - just-eat.co.uk just for illegal shit. <br /><br />And I would say neither is evil per se, things like good/evil/right/wrong, you can&#039;t really attach that those terms to a commercial enterprise because it gets in the way of profit. If you look at Maccy D&#039;s they cut down large parts of the Amazon which displaces indigenous people and ruin the environment to graze cattle that then get turned into burgers. Yum Yum. If you look at the Colombian cocaine cartels/Afghan heroin cartels they create addicts for cash. Sniff Shoot. If you look at SR it facilitates the meeting of parties that want to find things that are usually hard to get however it can POTENTIALLY be a factor in becoming in people becoming addicted however you could argue that this is a much safer for those that make the choice to do that. Digital Sniff Shoot Smoke. <br /><br />You have to look past what is good and bad and just see it as cause and effect. SR is just as much a part of the world economy as MacDonalds is and the Cocaine/Heroin Cartels have just as much a part as SR and MacDonalds. They just occupy different spaces within this economy. <br /><br />

This place makes buying drugs easy and safe; how many murders and muggings and overdoses has Silkroad prevented through its existence alone? How much money and manpower has Silkroad saved for law enforcement? A shitload, I bet.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure that, behind all the bullshit, the people who run this country realize quite clearly that the drug war has been a failure.

				&nbsp; Keeping S.R. alive is not in the government&#039;s best interest.&nbsp; The government has a hard time admitting that they are wrong and assume they &quot;look weak&quot; if they do (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Defense about the war on terror).&nbsp; Following this logic, they want to shut it down.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; On the other hand, if you have been following any of the recent cyber crime discussions, S.R. seems to fit pretty low on LE&#039;s priority list (especailly Europol).&nbsp; While it does support international organized crime, it comes across as a decently civil business and isn&#039;t connected to any specific cause.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t defrauding mass amount of people, stealing information or property, endangering the nations security, or any of the other major cyber crime problems mentioned.&nbsp; A similar example is the call services in New York (escort and mmj delivery).&nbsp; While it is pretty easy for anyone to have weed or a hooker at their house just by leaving a message, they operate out of public sight and often have a &quot;clean&quot; appearance.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; The U.S. government will not tolerate being a drug courier but, they have bigger problems to deal with.&nbsp; On any given week, you can read about massive shipments of cocaine being seized (sent via mail), bot networks that steal millions of dollars, etc...&nbsp; If anything, S.R. will be shut down by the FBI, NSA, ICE, DEA or USPS (not European LE; it is obvious they don&#039;t have their shit together).&nbsp; I have no doubt LE will shut it down eventually, it is just a matter of how many resources they are willing to use.&nbsp; Shutting down S.R. needs to handled delicately.&nbsp; Bitcoin, Encyption and Tor are all legitimate barriers that cannot be overlooked without law suits or bigger problems arising (i.e. corrupting Tor, breaking encryption they use for secret level document, taking away due process).&nbsp; <br /><br />@ Limitless- McDonalds may be applicable as a very simplified economic model but economics has no standing when talking about the existence of an illegal entity.&nbsp; The government is a rational institution but the influence of factors is based on a sliding scale.&nbsp; The part of S.R. being illegal trumps all other factors that produce rational influence.<br /><br />&nbsp; I fully agree drug reform is an all or nothing situation.&nbsp; Legalize all drugs (not decriminalize).&nbsp; New problems will arise but they can be dealt with through an emphasis on education and liberty.&nbsp; Our current drug policy just perpetuates itself (which is a side effect, not a goal).

				theeroticreview.com is an escort review site, I mean these girls have websites with menus (bbbj = bareback blowjob, greek = anal, msog = multi shot on goal (ie, you can cum more than once). Their phone numbers and pictures are right there, not to mention the backpage advertisements. The girls keep the same phone numbers because it&#039;s the only way to truly verify if a listing is real or not, yet these girls operate virtually undeterred when it would be quite easy for a sting operation to setup appointments with these girls and taken down 20 or more a day - but they don&#039;t.<br /><br />They will bust them on the street for solicitation because the probability of violence and other crime is more prevalent and it&#039;s in the open view of bystanders.<br /><br />I would like to think, and hope, the same applies to SR. It&#039;s hidden, less so recently with all the media coverage, and doesn&#039;t propagate the amount of violence street trade does. This, combined with the difficulty of legally shutting it down in the first place, probably puts SR pretty low on the priority list.

				I actually DO think it&#039;s in the best interest of various governments worldwide to keep SR alive. Of course, they&#039;ll never accept that fact as long as the public view on drugs is that they&#039;re going to destroy humanity if ever legalized.

				[Editors note: Wow this turned into a long post! drzheng sells some seriously good methylone]<br /><br />It&#039;s worth noting that almost everyone in positions of power in this world, if they aren&#039;t current users of illegal drugs, at least used them in the past and know many people who use them, and many are directly involved in drug commerce. No one does cocaine like the rich and powerful. Plenty of people on wall street are doing lots of that and MDMA. Silicon valley? MDMA was initially rediscovered and popularized in the SF bay area among scientists and therapists associated with Sasha Shulgin. Myron Stolaroff worked at Ampex in Redwood City just down the road from Facebook and Apple HQ. Shit Google has a camp at Burning Man, San Francisco is half empty every year when BM is going on, Steve Jobs talked about the benefits of his LSD experiences, tech companies don&#039;t drug test and if they did they&#039;d have no one to work in it.<br /><br />Many dont actually believe in prohibition, some are against it in general, some just don&#039;t want the dumbass general public having access, and for some in favor, the war on drugs is about power and money, and keeping it in their hands. It&#039;s just politics that requires this degree of secrecy, it&#039;s a type of secret society like the freemasons, many founding fathers were members, they planned Washington, SF and other cities from the ground up, but it wasn&#039;t and isn&#039;t something you could talk about in mass media because the public wouldn&#039;t be able to accept it. Same for extraterrestrials, yeah sure if you&#039;re paying attention you know they&#039;re out there, there is hard evidence, but it&#039;s maybe not a subject ready for mass public consumption, the government lets out certain facts to informed people, but slowly so as not to cause mass hysteria. Afterall they have technology far more advanced than ours and could wipe us out if they felt like it. All of our advanced weapons wouldn&#039;t have much use if we couldn&#039;t launch them...<br /><br />I always wondered if SR wasn&#039;t actually run by somebody or somebodys with powerful connections who are against the war on drugs for any of a number of reasons. I&#039;m sure at least some rich and powerful people are members and buying or selling drugs here. Keeping it running but out of the public eye is definitely in some of their interests, and frankly in all of OUR interest because the less attention given to us the better. Everyone knows everyone is doing drugs, but it&#039;s just not time to come out publicly about it. But look at Charlie Sheen, Paris, Lindsay Lohan and other celebrities, everyone knows what they&#039;re up to and they&#039;ve as much as admitted it, they&#039;re not killing anyone other than themselves and nobody really cares.<br /><br />Drugs are a problem in the hands of people who aren&#039;t intelligent or responsible enough to learn about them and use them responsibly, and unscrupulous people and violent gangsters in the trade. Just getting on SR and buying or selling things requires a minimum level of knowing what the fuck you&#039;re doing, so we at least all have a base level of intelligence and most of us want to and can use responsibly. The feedback system and forums get unscrupulous suppliers run out of town quick and no one can gun down the competition.&nbsp; SR is actually playing a role, maybe a big role, in reducing the social harms of drug use. Thus people arent dying from SR drugs, can&#039;t attract media attention and politicians don&#039;t want the general public knowing about this anyway. Its like the speakeasys and trade during alcohol prohibition, everyone up to the president was illegally drinking, and everyone knew that, you just had to keep it under wraps and not attract attention so everyone could keep doing what they wanted.

				My 2 cents:<br /><br />While I think police/dea obviously want to bust drug users, the streets are rampants with so many that there&#039;s not much point for them to go through the extra hassle and effort to TRY(and likely fail) to bust an online SR user/vendor. It doesn&#039;t mean they won&#039;t, but I don&#039;t see the point when the police in America are already overwhelmed with the amount of drug-activity on the &#039;streets&#039;. They just want convictions, and they likely want to do so as easly as possible. It&#039;s not like there&#039;s a shortage of drug-crime being commited in America.

				guys, its not the Silk Road that the government lets it. it is the&nbsp; TOR. and from what i have read TOR is about 95% child pornography. <br />this should get us into more thoughts. There are sick bastards out there that allow child pornography. Silk Road is a perfect example on how all business should be made when paying online. well ok, its about drugs, but you understand what i mean? TOR...if it dies.... if all onion sites cannot work, i think child pornography will be significantly reduced. And all similar activities in the clearnet would be an easy game for the LE to bring down.<br /><br />Dont forget, (correct me if i am wrong) that tor was designed for military hidden communication? <br />You have heard of HAARP? that belongs to the military too. <br /><br />Anyways... someone gets a lot of money from SR alone, (and i dont mean DPR) ... imagine what money is moved to child pornography, if SR is just a part of the darknet<br />oh and i just remembered some nice lyrics from System of a down <br /><br />&quot;utilizing drugs to pay for secret wars around the wolrd...&quot;<br />How would you feel if you u knew that some of your money is used to buy and supply ak-47 to children??<br /><br />my opinion. i have told it before. Someone big, really high class, even higher than governments (massons ? dea) allow all this. <br />cause this is crazy
