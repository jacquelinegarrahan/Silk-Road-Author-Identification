				Anyone have any pro-tips they&#039;d like to share regarding getting tanks filled?&nbsp; Seems that the best bet to get anything but automotive-grade is to get your catering license for food grade.&nbsp; As far as I&#039;m aware, the only difference between food and medical is that they add petroleum jelly to food grade, which can be filtered out w/ any piece of cloth over the nozzle.&nbsp; I know making systems for filtering automotive isn&#039;t that hard, but it&#039;s just a step I don&#039;t want to deal with - and I still feel like the gas is lower quality even once filtered.<br /><br />I have plenty of airgas suppliers around my area, have excellent social engineering skills, and clean up very well lol, so keep that in mind. I&#039;ve been known to bullshit my way through much more difficult situations, so if anyone has tips for this lemme know!&nbsp; &nbsp; I also have plenty of friends in the restaurant industry, so maybe that could be a huge help?&nbsp; Not looking to get into the business or anything as I value my exquisite jawline and dental structure, would just be nice to grab a 25lber every once in a while for hotel parties and whatnot :)<br /><br />Cheers to anyone who can shed some knowledge on the subject!

				Food grade is as easy as writing up an out of town catering service with a business card.<br />Medical grade is as easy as finding the local furiously fast street racers, the big dogs all use medical grade nitrous in the tanks.<br /><br />I use to get 3-4 5 foot tanks a week. Throw parties where half the ppl got arrested and the other half got hurt trying to get away.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				check out my N2O filtering system, racing gas is straight N2O with sulfur dioxide added, remove the sulfur and it&#039;s pure N2O, I&#039;ve been huffing it for years...<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/34344e8cc8<br />with fresh filters the N2O is so sweet it&#039;s like syrup in your mouth ;}<br />my vendors page<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/32d843c09d
