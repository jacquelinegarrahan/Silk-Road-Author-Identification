				Hello all,<br /><br />New here and felt appropriate that I should introduce myself. My discovery of this website I owe to whole reddit thread/gawker debacle, and spent some time researching it back then but lacked any sort of funds to get going and by then the exchange of bitcoins had skyrocketed. I just recently remembered this place existing and saw that the exchange rate was somewhat reasonable and decided to start making and saving bitcoins in order to make some purchases. I find this service invaluable since I&#039;ve recently relocated and lost all connects for my drugs of choice (opioids).<br /><br />I also have a huge interest in playing NHL over PSN, writing/recording music, and cooking low carb foods.

				So your mining bitcoins or just buying and making a bit as the price has gone up of late! Wish I had enough for 1000 BTC a few weeks ago - I&#039;d earn something - 70p each bitcoin so good if you save BTC and that happens.<br /><br />Well as for opiods I got no dealings with those. Got a friend in prison sorted out - but not here - IRL. the guy is doing time and kept his mouth shut so is owed favours. Sad he cannot smoke hash in prison but its too many drug tests. Heroin you can get out the system quickly but not weed! <br /><br />Anyhow be care with the opiates or opioids. If your buying then sample some small amount. Try to read up a lot on the H forums! Those guys and girls there know what good H is. for me - I&#039;d likely be gone and addicted very quickly. So I avoid H but get opiate pain killers.&nbsp; ;) They do me, mostly for pain but they are chilling also. So far I never banged my prescription in a few days. <br /><br />As for low carb food - I just eat healthy and am no watching weight so like a pasta also! Just ate fish and chips which is like extreme carb but I feel good and ate some fresh veg with it and always cook my own bread.<br /><br />Actually cooking a chocolate cake this weekend. A special cake. One with approx 2 oz worth of resin extract. This would mean if I cut it into 8 then 8 people would be taking the THC from approx 7 grams of fine bud. I&#039;d eat half the cake. I might even do just that. Mrs Red says its not fair because she is waiting for her coke and I got my hash and so on. <br /><br />Of all the drugs to really like - coke is an unfortunate drug of choice! I mean to say I &#039;like&#039; coke but no way could I take that every day or every weekend! <br /><br />Wish my wife was into normal drugs enjoyed by UK&#039;ers. Weed, hash, related cannabis extracts, a touch of MDMA, some Valium to ease things and a bit of LSD, some speed to get low down and dirty a few times a year. Drink 12 pints. Stay up all night drinking. Or whatever!<br /><br />Any toehr drug aside from coke is pretty easy yo get here. We can get coke but its a difficult time right now - few vendors having to take a break, others taking over from established vendors. Coke is the most argued about drug because lets face its the highest priced drug most commonly used by people. <br /><br />My wife will not touch speed. Says it always seems &#039;dirty&#039; compared to coke. Well - each to their own I suppose.<br /><br />Be careful with the first buy. Welcome also. I like real football (English version)
