				Grab your sleeping bag, stock up on supplies and get ready to camp out on your computer for 49 hours, because on April 20, 2012 at 4:20 PM, the greatest sale in the history of the Silk Road kicks into gear, and you&#039;re not going to want to miss a minute of it.<br /><br />This 4/20, every 420 seconds, some lucky buyer will win one of our 420 great prizes! From $50 gift certificates to a brand new iPhone 4s, some lucky person will be chosen every 420 seconds to win a prize.<br /><br />Of course, we aren&#039;t stopping there. We are also offering a grand prize trip of a lifetime. A trip for two with all the trimmings to paradise, all expenses included. 12 days of the nicest weather, the clearest blue waters, and the finest accommodations you can imagine are all included. You won&#039;t even need to pack for this one, as we&#039;re including $2,000 spending money for your travel wardrobe and incidental (cough *weed* cough) expenses. From the time the limousine picks you up at your front door, until you&#039;re swimming with the dolphins or taking in a helicopter tour, you just aren&#039;t gonna believe your luck!<br /><br />Every time you complete a sale you can win one of our 420 second prizes, and for every btc you spend during the sale, we&#039;ll put in one entry for you for our Take a Trip to Paradise Grand Prize. Seriously, why would you be anywhere else but on your computer from 4:20 PM (UTC) on Friday, April 20, until 5:20 PM (UTC) on Sunday, April 22, 2012. One great prize every 420 seconds, and the mother of all Grand Prizes could be yours with a single purchase.<br /><br />But wait, you also get these six Ginsu knives -- wait, wrong script. Wait, there&#039;s more -- Every item on the site will be discounted up to 10%! IN ADDITION to this, our vendors have put together some deep discounts on your favorite 420 goodies.&nbsp; More info and links here:&nbsp; silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/four_twenty<br /><br />PS - if you are a vendor who isn&#039;t on the sale list and would like to be, just send a description of your sale over to Vendor Support and we&#039;ll add you asap.

				Super excited for the sale. Big thanks to all the vendors who participate, your customers appreciate it HIGHly&nbsp; :P<br /><br />One question though... How will the vacation be awarded? It would seem to me that winning it would force one to compromise their anonymity... Is this not the case? Or just the risk you take for such an epic, all expenses paid vacation?<br /><br />One more big thanks to DPR and all SR&#039;s vendors... You guys rock.

				I used to think all those people who camped out all night for a sale were stupid, but now my sleeping bag is ready. It would be a good idea if vendors could offer a delayed send date or a finalize when ready option because my post man may need a wheel barrow the week after this weekend, also this would reduce the risk of LE having extra checks for the week after.

				Awesome sale, although the &#039;trip&#039; sounds like a terrible idea (you&#039;ll have to handover a shitload of personal info). I&#039;ll be in it for just the discounts ;).<br /><br />Afaik the SR fee will be removed (probably not the 4% hedge fee). So for everyone&#039;s convenience, these are the current fees:<br /><br />10% of the first $50 (max $5)<br />8.5% of $50 - 150 (max $8.50)<br />6% of $150 - 300 (max $9)<br />3% of $300 - 500 (max $6)<br />2% of $500 - 1000 (max $10)<br />1.5% for everything over $1000 (min $15.015)

				Think I&#039;ll be passing up on this sale. At 1st, I was like, I should spend 10K and get the most &#039;raffle tickets&#039; for the vacation. I sure could use a good vacation. But then, the way I would&#039;ve done it was collusion, which is most likely what is going to happen, anyway. Right? <br />But what really has me avoiding it, is that 420 is already a well known holiday, at it seems like if everyone is waiting for a certain day to buy, and a certain day to ship, then it&#039;s essentially back-logging packages, on a day where security might be stepped up. I will order today, and be sad I have no chance at a vacation.

				just to be clear, the more you spend, the more chance you have of winning, so doing lots of small purchases won&#039;t be better than doing fewer big purchases.&nbsp; and yes the servers should be up to the task, todays trouble didn&#039;t have anything to do with server load.

				I know it&#039;s just me, and nothing to do with this sale/prize, but a common LE ruse to find &#039;bad&#039; guys, is to say &quot;You&#039;ve won a prize!!!!&quot;&nbsp; Apparently people who are normally very careful about security, let down their guard if they win something....or it&#039;s *free!!!*<br /><br />Me, I don&#039;t need any prizes, giveaways, free samples, or any of the like.&nbsp; Just need SR to keep on.&nbsp; And for me not to let my guard down, which often is difficult. I want to be friendly, all that, but security is everything, and sitting on that cold concrete bench in a felony tank is hard hard hard.&nbsp; Like I said, just me, but this makes me uncomfortable: we can never be a group, a gang, pals: our strength is our anonymity, from Tor to btc to me being careful...

				I am a little confused about the prizes.&nbsp; &nbsp;So is the second prize this------&gt;&quot;every 420 seconds, some lucky buyer will win one of our 420 great prizes! From $50 gift certificates to a brand new iPhone 4s, some lucky person will be chosen every 420 seconds to win a prize.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Then to&nbsp; win one of these 420 second place prizes it will take entries which are gained from spending bitcoins?The more spent the more entries?&nbsp; I am going to do a&nbsp; few larger orders but I might as well just wait until 420 to do them. This will give me more entries for the second place and grand prizes?<br /><br />Does being online have anything&nbsp; to do with winning prizes? I&nbsp; dont want to camp by my computer for 49 hours but I will if i need to ;)

				maybe they just dump enough bitcoins in your account to go to the bahamas or something, but advertise it as a Vacation, because it sounds better than the first prize is an undetermined amount of BTC.

				While a healthy amount of paranoia is a good thing, I really can&#039;t see how this trip could EVER equate to a trip to club fed....<br /><br />I mean, it&#039;s not like DPR tells the booking agent that this trip is going to be a prize for &quot;The Amazon of Drugs&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure all the reservations are done anonymously.&nbsp; No info about where/when it&#039;s going to take place is going to be posted.&nbsp; There is really a very very small risk to a buyer winning this vacation.<br /><br />Infact the only risk I can see is that if DPR has already been busted and is just trying to rake in everyone (super highly unlikely).&nbsp; Also, why would they go after simple users?&nbsp; They want us vendors, they don&#039;t give 2 shits about you guys.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not like we&#039;re entering a raffle sponsered by the DEA, it&#039;s sponsered by the most trusted member of this community!&nbsp; <br />

I want to be friendly, all that, but security is everything, and sitting on that cold concrete bench in a felony tank is hard hard hard.&nbsp; Like I said, just me, but this makes me uncomfortable: we can never be a group, a gang, pals: our strength is our anonymity, from Tor to btc to me being careful...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well said phubaiblues. I have read numerous reports of LE stings in this very same way. <br />I also I saw a REPO-sting operation where the repo tow company sent out a free dinner ticket +1 to debtors.

The debtor tries to hid for so long only to get caught up for a free dinner. Stupid. <br /><br />Everyone should be more careful about what they post and do online. I&#039;ll pass on the felony tank. How about the rest of you? Any prizes, giveaway, free samples, or any similar should be viewed with extreme caution. Better safe and not win.

				phubaiblues i know exactly what you are talking about. I too have seen certain law enforcement tactics such as you mentioned, especially one possibly was come claim your boat you won... show us your id to claim your prize, as person with felony warrant just walked in one after the other just to be arrested. said it is much easier to get all the folks with warrants to just come to you rather than having to chase em down. definitely saw like a cops episode or something too. honestly first thing I thought of with all the prizes like a vacation and cell phone etc which could potentially be very dangerous to accept. maybe id give my grandparents a nice vacation or something if i win (would that be wrong to risk it with someone else), dont think i could handle the anxiety. if i win some free dope from tony too though to manage my anxiety maybe then i would risk it :) you know what im saying dawg <br /><br />whoever wins and actually goes on the trip, will certainly have a once in a lifetime kind of best experience ever vacation... cant wait to hear about it hopefully<br /><br />also to whoever asked, i believe the winners will be announced as was already said and as was done with the last sale and prize giveaway. (is the winner still around? can you respond please if you read, thanks). dpr just said especially for the grand prize winner they wont be announced till after they return from the party.

				Doesn&#039;t giving away those prizes compromise the security of individuals? The iPhone and the trip; wouldn&#039;t both of those be potential security holes on both ends? I&#039;d like to know more about how the event is being kept secure on that end...

You&#039;re only supposed to finalize after your order arrives, after all. Even if you plan on finalizing early, which you ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT DO, EVER, the option is only made available when the seller confirms shipping, and with the higher volume of orders due to the sale, it&#039;s a sure bet that most orders made on 4/20 will only get shipped a few days later - which means that in those cases you won&#039;t even be able to finalize until the sale is over.

				Out of all of these dealers with sales listed for the big 420 sale (a holiday based on marijuana) and NO ONE has amounts higher than an oz for sale? Maybe I&#039;m wrong but how many people are really going to come to silk road to buy a gram or an 1/8th? <br /><br />To all of you sellers I&#039;m looking for a discounted qp or half p.

				i&#039;m not sure, if i&#039;ll take part with at this event, but the give-aways from sr are an awesome idea! i would take the trip for two to paradies without any concerns, haha... - the user, who wins the price will definately stay anonymous till the trip is over, as far as i could read, so don&#039;t bother... - secondly, the iphones and stuff like that, won&#039;t get bought through amazon from sr-stuff or something... - i guess, they have pretty good contacts to people from the carding scene, who will provide them the stuff... - just a thought... - <br /><br />i&#039;ll make a WARM-UP FOR 4/20 and will open within NEXT HOUR A THREAD, providing 10x FREE 250 MG SAMPLES OF PURE WHITE MDMA CRYSTALS = FOR REPUTABLE MEMBERS + HONEST FEEDBACK - ... to build up some decent reputation here... - which seems to be harder than i thought, haha... ;)<br /><br />best greetings, imprint :D<br /><br />PURE WHITE MDMA CRYSTALS (PIC)<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=bb5e5f2b45377451669c0dd8fd443227.jpg<br /><br />ps: i&#039;ll add a link here, when i&#039;ve posted the thread... -

				Some vendors are more than removing the fee!! :D<br /><br />Some GREAT offers out there and wow I need more bitcoins. ;D<br /><br />I feel like a chick with a loaded credit card hitting the sales!! ::)<br /><br />Shall I get the coke - or the E - or more Afghan black or a dabble of this and a smattering of that? 8)<br /><br />And I mean - the money off is fantastic but the free prize every 420 secs - oh man its all so exciting and we should start a winners thread here so I can hopefully be the one that says I am going to paradise or even having the $50 would nice! The iphone I will gladly take! Security issues? lol - so what if you use SR it might be for legit things like sunglasses. I myself buy sunglasses here online. I have many pairs. I am a regular sunglass wearing dude. Its what I do. And for a party trick I put them on my - well - lets move on....<br /><br />But this sale!<br /><br />Cannot wait and I think the 25% off coke is going to lure us in for the 8 ball maybe.<br /><br />But I&#039;m thinking about getting enough E to see me through a few years! Stash the stuff. Own usage emergency stash for Christmas 2015. <br /><br />Its fantastic this sale and I would love to win something or even find an extra tablet or something - a little taste of some tasty hash to supplement the 10 gram of Afghan black. I like treats! don&#039;t we all? <br /><br />I feel lucky for this sale - good odds - but I got a tactic that I think might favour me. I might be VERY stoned right now but I got some math formula and a vision of me with the iphone and the holiday and maybe winning the 8-ball of coke or money to buy one. <br /><br />I will see you all there!!! ;D

				Having a sheet doesn&#039;t make you a dealer, but under Federal law it certainly would, and through in the fact you got it sent across state lines and using the USPS they can easily get you on a federal offense, and whatever felonies they can pull out their ass. I am sure they would charge you with a bunch and then offer a deal, so you plead guilty to only 1 or two.

				A few sellers have dropped prices in the lead up. I found some coke with 25% off from a reputable dealer. I decided to treat myself.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />The UTC time zone is one hour behind the UK so 5.40pm here is the appointed time.<br /><br />I spent most of my BTC last night as I got 25% off a few things and thought I would take it whilst it is there.<br /><br />I am waiting for some more BTC but aint got but 12 or so which will grab me something nice.

				Banango, you won&#039;t see a change in price if the vendors have their products set at the price before commission. The price would be 10% higher if not for the sale. Some vendors have their product set at the price after commission, and their prices have in fact gone down.

				I didnt see a drop for my order as well, but wanted to put it in anyway so i can enter the 420 drawings. Hopefully i will get some extras or something in my order. Not really worried because from our brief conversation the seller seems cool as hell.

				Thanks for explaining divinechems, that makes sense now. I&#039;m pretty new here, just over a month and three transactions so I did not know that was how it worked. I thought every item would be reduced 10% today and had my BTC all planned out. My fault, but I&#039;m still bummed cause now I&#039;m short... maybe there is a kind soul out there who would loan me the 6 BTC? Or even 3 BTC would allow me to get my backup item.

				sorry to those who were expecting deeper discounts.&nbsp; some of the vendors did not opt in to the &quot;up to 10% off&quot; part of the sale, so instead of their items being discounted, they stayed the same and the discount is passed to them instead.&nbsp; Still, there are some amazing deals on the market right now, so keep looking if your original plan isn&#039;t panning out.&nbsp;

If you&#039;re dropping your commission fees, then the prices should go down, and the vendors should be forced to manually increase their prices if they feel like being dicks.<br /><br />From looking around, I don&#039;t see that any of my vendors opted to let the discount pass along to the customers.<br /><br />What a huge letdown. Instead of having a commission free weekend, like the last sale, or a normal weekend with normal commission, the feeling of disappointment has made this weekend worse than normal. I stockpiled some bitcoins in anticipation, but I may as well have just ordered earlier this week so I could actually have my drugs ON 420.

				i planned this since weeks ago. i messaged support to make sure listing like mine is ok. they read message but didnt respond. some people want to play the game but dont want to risk lots of drug orders to play. downloads on hidden site not safe so i sell nothing. more people play and be happy if they win. if they dont win i give the codes so somebody else can play. i am happy on 420 and i want others to be happy too. if SR didn&#039;t want me to sell nothing, they could have told me weeks ago when i asked. sit back relax and enjoy the love being spread. more listings have bought so more codes will be posted later but now i am going to sleep a few hours.

				Sr doesn&#039;t lose out by you doing it so I doubt anyone will take issue with it<br /><br />Although this is making me think.. What&#039;s stopping you from buying 0.00 or 0.01 items hundreds of time to get prizes?<br /><br />I know that the grand prize requires 1btc to be spent, but the every 420 prizes? It just says every purchase.<br /><br />I suppose they could have a minimum purchase amount but I just won spending 0.4 so maybe not?

				I see I think I understand. You are a proprietor of goods and package them up real nice and pretty for re-sell at a slightly adjusted rate to cover costs and time spent making your own package for your goods, so they can be easily passed on to a consumer that is more suited to the cultural standards.<br /><br />

				I think special out of escrow transactions is just frowned upon, and is whatever agreement the two parties have discussed, but doing all your sales out of escrow and under the rug to get around fees would definitely get your account banned.

				And bloymymind: This isn&#039;t a scam.<br />Do you think that everyone in the world is corrupt and greedy like politicians and those rich people?<br />Some people actually do believe in freedom, and will find a way to get it. Just because we don&#039;t seek to rule the world the way a politician does doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re weak. <br />This website is a place of freedom.<br />Like in Heinlein&#039;s book, &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, this is a place of rational anarchy.<br />This is not a dream. This sort of place does exist, we do defy society and we are winning. We have won so much, that you&#039;re able to get free money, just for buying illegal products. Isn&#039;t that beautiful?

There&#039;s a two word code in the email (that anyone can use!). You apply the code to your order at checkout, and it uses coins from there first.<br /><br />If the order is less than the code amount, the remainder stays on the code and you can use it again. If the order is MORE than the code amount, it will adjust the &quot;total&quot; due and deduct that from your normal account balance.

				&nbsp;;D Woo hoo! I just won 5 btc!<br />I was at a techno night last night, lots of people looking for pills an such.&nbsp; Decided to tell someone about the road. At first they didn&#039;t believe me, and by the end of the night who knows if they&#039;ll even remember any details from what I said. This really is special for those of us currently involved. A lot of the general population (even the ravers out there), actually think SR sounds so good that is can&#039;t actually be true! Their loss!... my 5btc win!<br />&nbsp;Where else do you win a gift code for half a G of MDMA? This place is just damn exciting!<br />Thanks DPR!&nbsp; Just goes to show, this epic sale was worth saving our btc for!

				I am so happy for you all! <br /><br />I hope the bad luck will even out on all these lotto entry i have been buying all day! <br /><br />Realy tho, the give back from Dread and SR staff for this giveaway is amazing, would never happen with typical business, always looking at bottom dollar and profit margins. Good to know this is more a family/community than just dealers/buyers.<br /><br />Worried that scammers are lessening my chances at getting a little bonus after spending over 1000 in 2 days.. If sombody had a buyer account and vendor account, could they jsut buy/ fe/ send btc back. buy/ fe/ send btc back..&nbsp; I know that would probably take a while for each free entry.. unless the custom listing was 1000 btc..&nbsp; Or whatever scam 3bags mentioned. <br /><br />Either way I have a ton of great goodies on the way and a few more hours to win!

				Congrats Bubble. You deserve to win. You are always so helpful. Hopefully I get my coins before this sale is over. I just want to order 400MG of DMT freebase from MoonUnit. <br /><br />Originally I thought he was giving out 400mg DMT samples as long as shipping was paid but the next day his name was off the 4/20 sale list. Hell I would have bought one sample and then paid for 400mg so that I could have recieved 800mg of DMT. A bunch of friends and I really want to give it a try.

				With all of the talk about lotteries, I&#039;m surprised no one is talking about the one from LittlePharma? He has a lottery going right now for a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tab ($2.53 per ticket) that&#039;s about to be drawn on 4/30. It has only 2 people in it so far (I&#039;m 1 of them), and he said that he&#039;ll give it away even if only 5 people participate! That&#039;s AWESOME odds for something that sells for $450 at Best Buy!

				What if-<br /><br />SR raised fees to 20%, but ONLY for people who chose to participate in a permanent lucky winner thingy.<br />Reduce winning a little bit, so the site doesn&#039;t go bankrupt, but that would be a fun way to make every sale exciting, for those who want to participate. <br /><br />Also, my lottery has four tickets left!

				Thanks for all the fun DPR!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally picked up a 10 BTC winner after spending $1100, but was VERY happy to see it<br /><br />Thanks for making SR such a great place.&nbsp; And I can&#039;t imagine what great sales stats all the vendors must be racking upe during this sale (not to mention, all the loot)<br /><br />And DPR Isn&#039;t making a single penny off this whole 4/20 sale, he could have very well said, screw it, but instead threw down $20,000 in prizes (i&#039;m guessing) AND isn&#039;t charging commission right now!!&nbsp; <br /><br />God bless you DPR you are truly a Saint!

				Lol, you know that old saying &quot;Nothing comes for free&quot;, Im kinda on a...&quot;i&#039;ll believe it when i see it&quot; trip. But even when i do recieve it, im kinda worried...like really...has anyone thought this could be a sting or something? With farmers market going down etc.It really seems too good to be true. Maybe to cynical. I hope that me sayin this wont upset anyone, I just thought i would ask, i am extremley thankful , just...very very safety conscious.

				Heh...so I was a grumpy motherfucker this morning.<br /><br />&quot;Man, this sucks, none of the vendors are passing along the commission savings to the buyers&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Man, this sucks, I read page after page of people who I&#039;ve never seen participate on here winning codes&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Man, this sucks, I&#039;ve spent so many thousands of dollars on the site over the past year, and I don&#039;t win anything&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Man, this sucks, you could easily use the lack of commission to rig buyer and vendor reputations, scammers will figure this out and totally abuse the system&quot;<br /><br />And then....hmm, I see a new vendor that seems to have a decent rep (&quot;Off The Wagon&quot;) has some percocets for sale for $5 each, an actual reasonable price. It&#039;s not a Pharmville price, but I&#039;ll take it. So I order about $90 worth.<br /><br />Message from SR! I win 10 BTC! YEAH! So, now I am no longer a grumpy motherfucker. <br /><br />Thanks DPR!

				&nbsp;:)OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!<br />I WON THE TRIP!!!<br />THIS IS SO GOOD, I&#039;VE NEVER EVEN BEEN OVERSEAS BEFORE!<br /><br /><br />lol just jokes, that last bit was true though! Maybe that&#039;s why I bought some cheap trips instead, for the best price in the 420 sale, all thanks to DPR, SR and this amazing community of vendors and buyers standing up for their rights. I&#039;ve got some MDA, MDMA, 25i-nbome, 2ce and 2ci on the way.&nbsp; All of which combined comes to less that I would pay for a single gram of MDMA where I live (with questionable quality too).<br /><br />I have never been more proud at being a part of any community or advancement on the internet.

				This 420 sale was great - I haven&#039;t seen anything else like that anywhere. Didn&#039;t win anything, but hey - I had a great time and there were so many &quot;too good to be true&quot; offers, that I can&#039;t even imagine what the next year&#039;s 420 would be. SR - you&#039;re terribly good, keep on goin&#039;! <br /><br />xphor - this is not the right place for your question, you should definitely try the 2Cs (not as strong as LSD, however giving really colorful, sensetional, mind blowing trips, still feeling mild and not too intens or alienating) - there are some great offerings on SR for 2C-B &amp; 2C-P, which I&#039;d generally prefer to 2C-I, which is maybe the most popular. And, with some MDMA a bit earlier, the trip is f*ckin&#039; fantastic :)

				I just won ฿10! Thank you Silk Road.<br /><br />I don&#039;t normally finalize early; the escrow system is for everyone&#039;s protection. But I do understand that some of the vendors, especially those having 420 sales, might be stretched a bit thin. Since I only do business with good rep people and I am active in the forums as well? AND since it was my order to Noriega that gained me a&nbsp; ฿10 gift code? I am taking the plunge and finalizing early with Noriega.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br />Quick PM to xphor on the topic of psychedelic so as to not derail this thread.

				Just to congratulate Kiwi! For a moment I wondered if my prize was THE prize! I won 110 BTC so am over the moon anyway. Spent it all now. that is what we do with prize money in the UK. <br /><br />Enjoy the holiday mate.<br /><br />Thanks SR for making us all winners int he sale regardless of winning a prize or not.<br /><br />There were some GREAT deals and scoring 5 BTC of the normal price of coke - wow - and MDMA at about 25 UK £ = wow again.<br /><br />I got some GREAT bargains.

				Yes I assumed it was last years thread. <br />Revived and continued for this year?<br /><br />It&#039;s got he Boss&#039;s name on it as the OP so it looks great. <br />We need promotion because we are just starting.&nbsp; Money/gear isn&#039;t an issue, we would like to be a &#039;junior&#039; sponsor of the event. I would assume large vendors should get the top ad spots.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;ll sub the thread and follow.
