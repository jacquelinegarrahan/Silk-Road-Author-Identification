				If you think from a vendor&#039;s perspective, then no it&#039;s not safe to buy. Granted, I&#039;m not a vendor but I know they&#039;re taking huge losses just like us buyers. I don&#039;t think anyone should be mad if a vendor doesn&#039;t honor an order during these hard times, unless it&#039;s already been in transit for a few days.

				If it&#039;s already in transit and already on it&#039;s way to you, you should speak with the vendor and see what they think. If you FE at the current rate, they&#039;re going to lose money and the amount you get back depends on the hedging. If it&#039;s pegged to the dollar you&#039;ll get your $250 back, if pegged to BTC you&#039;ll get the current value back

				It&#039;s a bad situation for everyone. I bought my FIRST BTC&#039;s @ $130 and spent them right away only to look a couple days later and see that they are going for $260! Hope you get your order!<br /><br />P.S.-Joolz, if you DIDN&#039;T buy anything, your 1BTC would be still be in your account and worth $61

				Excellent point moxy! A vendor that accepted an order while BTC were 150, only to finalize at 250, makes a killing. It&#039;s risk. So the same rule should be applied when BTC value falls.

				as vendors we have had a lot of orders finalize during this crash and we have also accepted orders.&nbsp; We are taking losses as part of this current climate.&nbsp; We are doing this as we feel that this is only fair for the community as a whole!!! We do not want to use the crash as an excuse as to not be making profit!... win some u lose some, swings and round abouts.<br /><br />we will honor all of our orders during this climate, even though it means that we incur losses, what can we do about it? nothing... we must keep the community running!

				We have shipped every order that was placed in the last 2 days, both hedged and unhedged, and this included a .63 btc 1/2 ounce that was unhedged.<br /><br />I think it would be unethical to cancel orders based on btc fluctuations as the vendor has the choice of whether or not to hedge.

I hope my buyers see how legit I am and it gains me some long term loyal customers. I have lost a lot, but I made a lot too, so it all works out in my mind.<br /><br />And on another side of it, this drop has encouraged me to spend and cash out as I go and not hoard all my BTC, it needs to be traded and passed around for it to have value, otherwise it&#039;s a speculators market and can crash with a few big players getting out. I have made as many purchases today as I have confirmed and shipped, so I hope my sellers are as legit as I am!

				We kinda put ourselves back in the SR vending game right towards the end of the market escalation/correction. <br /><br />All orders will be honored from us regardless. Our listings are pegged to the dollar, so it doesn&#039;t matter what the market did/does/will-do from that perspective; the price seen is the price paid.<br /><br />Much love and compassion to those on here who have felt the crack of the whip of the market contracting.

				For the record, I ordered this at least 24 hours before the crash and he hadn&#039;t shipped it out by the time of the crash. So he is slow to ship too.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Kensho.

That wasn&#039;t my money to lose.<br /><br />You wish to build a relationship with your buyers, huh? I think you should remove that lie from your profile. You just ruined my relationship with my best friend who I&#039;ve known for 23 of the 26 years I been on this planet.
