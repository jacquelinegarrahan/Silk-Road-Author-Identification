				Hey, I&#039;m in the resolution centre with BigBill6778 because he shipped my cannabis oil to the wrong country. I ordered it for my friend who has cancer and the waiting time has caused harm to everyone involved. Bill will not accept a refund because he has convinced himself that I told him to ship to Australia when I&#039;m from Europe.<br /><br />So I&#039;ve been stuck in resolution for 26 days because I gave him the benefit of the doubt (until he revealed yesterday that he sent it to the wrong continent!). There is 2 hours left on the resolution ticket and he will not accept a full refund for his mistake. <br /><br />What happens once the resolution time goes to 0? Does an SR mediator come in or do the funds get released to the vendor?<br /><br />Thanks

				Just extend the resolution time if nothing has been solved yet and you expect it being solved after more time
