				Since i gave props for their buds I might as well tell the whole story. So, I ordered some edibles from greenovendoor. I went for the bomb edibles rice krispy treats and treezits after i got some green crack. i ordered a 1/4 ounces of the weed and got 22 grams. I ordered 4 treats got 6 and 4 packs of treezit and got 6!!! they also put an 1/8 of bud with my edible orders. <br /><br />You might ready be thinking this is unheard of around here but thres even something else. They sent me a message saying asking for another address so thry could send me a free order because they expected my last order to be a day late. Mind you we are talking about a day late of 2 days?<br /><br />Of course i asked them to use same address and lo and behold on Saturday afternoon i got a package to my door of somd really really good grand dad purple buds thst smelled great.<br /><br />A 5/5 did not do these guys justice so i thought i share my last couple of weeks on SR.

That&#039;s exactly what caught my eye about that post. Hopefully it&#039;s just the vendor shilling for himself and slipped up rather than the vendor keeping the address on file of an actual customer?<br />Edit: And, like half that vendor&#039;s orders/feedback are FE and he&#039;s been here less than a month, is that allowed? Seems to be free shipping if you FE rather than him specifically requesting based on feedback though if that matters

				We have been fortunate enough to gain a really great buzz during the beginning of our SR business endevours simply by being over generous. I can&#039;t honestly say i recall adding an additional 1/2OZ to anyone&#039;s order but between an 3.5Gs - 7Gs of bonus product is rather uncommon around here. In the long, you get out whatever you put into something and as long as we continue to put out as much and in most cases a little more than our customer give, we believe we shall continue to run a productive business. <br /><br />When you&#039;ve been in the industry for as long as we have and have grew up in an area polulated by cannabis enthusiast, there becomes many opportunities to meet growers and suppliers who are gracious for despensaries looking for consistant quantity. By being in a position to place very lareg orders each week we are able to secure better than your average streets prices on cannabis and extracts. Unlike your neighborhood pusher, we actually do this for real. Our scales are not broke...we just OUTWEIGH the competition.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />Don&#039;t take it the wrong...we respect what we see everyone doing on here even the schemers and nit pickers, It kinda keeps this whole thing interesting. We hope to serve all of you some time or another!<br /><br />We appreciate you all...even the last few posters on this thread<br />The Green Oven Door (if we ever post, it&#039;ll be from this user...ALWAYS)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c2af292438<br />You won&#039;t be disappointed...We won&#039;t be beat!<br /><br />
