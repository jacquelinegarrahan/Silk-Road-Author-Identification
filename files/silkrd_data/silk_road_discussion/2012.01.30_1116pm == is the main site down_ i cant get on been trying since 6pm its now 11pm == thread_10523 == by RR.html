				its been a bit bogged down for me today, but I&#039;ve been able to get on.&nbsp; My bigger concern is the fact that none of the orders I expected to be updated to shipped have done so thus far today, and there&#039;s not much today left.&nbsp; A coincidence?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; OR MAYBE NOT

				Just checked out the bot link http://warweedoeg6lfyoz.onion/updown/ and the results are below.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />&gt;:( Silk Road is - DOWN<br /><br />As of: Tue Jan 31 03:51:42 UTC 2012 <br /><br />Sure as hell hope this is temporary. After weeks of studying bitcoins, pgp setups, setting up accounts to buy bitcoins and transfer funds, it would be a bitch to have it shutdown for good. It has been a lot of jumping through the hoops and hope it comes back up.
