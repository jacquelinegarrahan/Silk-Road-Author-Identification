				<br />Fleeing the Euro for Bitcoins <br /><br /><br />Worried your government is going to take your savings? There&#039;s an app for that.<br /><br />Actually, there&#039;s an entire currency: Bitcoin, an online-only currency based on a decentralized network. It&#039;s unregulated, hard to track and increasingly common. Since Sunday, downloads of three Bitcoin-related apps have surged on Spanish charts, Bloomberg Businessweek reports. <br /><br />The interest in Bitcoin coincided with news that the Cyprus government planned to tax savings accounts as part of the country&#039;s bailout program. The value of the online currency increased more than 20 percent in the past two days to $64, according to the latest price information.<br /><br />The downside is it&#039;s a currency that has experienced price fluctuations, occasional hacking and account thefts, and is a favorite for black-market transactions, including almost 2 million a month in illegal online drug purchases at the Silk Road marketplace. That some Europeans are investing savings in Bitcoin isn&#039;t exactly a sign of confidence in European banking.<br /><br />According to a European Central Bank report published in October, increased demand for Bitcoin &quot;could have a negative impact on the reputation of central banks,&quot; especially if the public perceives Bitcoin&#039;s rise is due to &quot;a central bank not doing its job properly.&quot;<br /><br />Bitcoin removes financial institutions completely from transactions, allowing users to conduct two-party exchanges over the Internet without a middleman. People can exchange local currencies into Bitcoins on online exchange sites and store them in e-wallets. Payment-processing services such as BitPay allow merchants to accept the currency as payments. The virtual money can buy a range of goods and services, including video strippers, gun parts, pizza and WordPress upgrades.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Without regulation or integration into existing banking structures, Bitcoin doesn&#039;t yet appeal to investors looking to park large amounts of money. But as the currency grows more mainstream, with banking confidence eroding, Bitcoin is something to watch.<br /><br /><br />clearnet link<br />http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-20/fleeing-the-euro-for-bitcoins-.html
