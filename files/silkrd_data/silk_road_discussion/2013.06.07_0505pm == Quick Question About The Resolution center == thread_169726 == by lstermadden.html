				Hey guys, I kinda am against the clock right now so ill try to be brief and to the point. Almost a month ago, I purchased 5 OC 40mg Pills from Googleyed&#039;s US Domestic Stash. <br /><br />He started communicating on sunday, saying that he just checked the tracking number, and I will be getting my package early THIS week. Monday, NO, Tuesday, NO, Wednesday, .. You get the point. He agreed that when I receive the package he will give me a 10% refund on the cost, which is very cool of him, and he said if I don&#039;t receive it today (friday) he will do a reship.<br /><br />I rather have the money back, but its the least he can do and Im fine with that, As long as Im not waiting another month :(<br /><br />My issue right now Is that there is 4 days left until auto finalize. Yesterday I clicked the resolve button in order to extend the Finalize date 10 days. So that resolution is sitting in the resolution center, and my orders page shows it as being in resolution, but there is still a counter saying 4 days left to auto finalize.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just want to make sure that I did the right thing.. In the box that says &quot;Extend Due Date&quot; i entered 10, and wrote a little paragraph describing the situation. <br /><br />So now do I just sit back and wait? I just don&#039;t want him to get my coins autofinalized if, as I suspect, he never even sent the products. Thanks for reading my situation, and I will check here periodically for responses! <br /><br />-Lster

				thank you for clearing that up libertas. If I go to my orders, My order is now listed under &#039;Resolution Center&#039; And if I click &#039;View&#039; It shows the order is in the &#039;Proposed Resolutions&#039; Section. What happens when the 10 days are up? Do I have to go back to the resolution center and propose another resolution? Grr this is the first time dealing with such a vender.. It has been 19 Days since I placed a DOMESTIC order :(

				I am curious about all of this too. There doesn&#039;t seem to be much info on the resolution center in the FAQ. I&#039;m just afraid to click anything here because it all is so final and actual details on the resolution center seem bare. <br /><br />

				The idea of the resolution center is that you can work out this issue with the vendor.&nbsp; There are generally two ways it&#039;s worked out.&nbsp; Either a refund or a reship.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to balance the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s.&nbsp; you may wait longer with a reship, but a refund will lose you some money(at least 4% as that&#039;s SR&#039;s fee - that&#039;s even if you get a 100% refund) AND it&#039;ll affect your refund rate on your account that shows up under your &#039;buyer statistics&#039;.&nbsp; This will make other vendor&#039;s more wary of you and less likely to want to enter a transaction with you.&nbsp; The only way it won&#039;t affect your refund rate is if you ask for a refund and the vendor doesn&#039;t propose ANY resolutions, not even an extension and the extension is granted by SR staff.<br /><br />You and the vendor can both post proposals as for how to resolve this.&nbsp; they show up under &#039;proposed resolutions&#039;.&nbsp; If at the time it&#039;s due, neither of you has agreed to the other&#039;s resolutions, the SR staff will review the transaction, proposed resolutions, and the previous transaction history of both you and the vendor and make a decision based on that.<br /><br />Best of luck. :)

				If what I say is drunken coke waffle then let me know but some folk might go to resolution not having read anything about it so for those who don&#039;t read up on how it works, once they go to resolution, do they already or if not should they receive a message to say that once in resolution, the case will be looked at without auto finalizing once it hits the last day before it does auto finalize. I panicked emailing support to look at a case I had thinking it would auto finalize before I knew it would be dealt with on the final day. I thought SR staff were too busy to get around to my case.<br /><br />Drunken coke waffle over!!!&nbsp; :)

				It&#039;s definitely not very intuitive or clear, but you go into resolution at least to prevent it from auto-finalizing if you haven&#039;t gotten it yet.&nbsp; Then there is a different deadline from the AF deadline where you propose resolutions to each other.&nbsp; If that second deadline passes without resolution, then SR staff gets involved.

				To OP, that&#039;s total BS. You should not have to wait that long for a domestic order. Worse, it sounds like the vendor is lying to you. He probably just doesn&#039;t have the product to ship and is stalling, but he should just admit as much and offer you a refund. I think you&#039;re right to request a refund rather than reship.
