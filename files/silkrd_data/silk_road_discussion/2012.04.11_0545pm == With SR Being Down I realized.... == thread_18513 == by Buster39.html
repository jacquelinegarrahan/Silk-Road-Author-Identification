				Sometime I just sit there, dreaming about how much fun I could be having if I won the lottery. Snowball fights with fists full of cocaine, searching for oompa loompas through a forest of weed and magical mushrooms, gumball machines overflowing with rainbows of ecstasy, an entire bookshelf of just Dr. Seuss books printed on tabs of LSD. Man...things would sure be swell. :)

				I agree SR is addicting. Each day I find myself spending more time on it sometimes I just browse for hours. I spend as much time on SR as I do watching TV. Its very interesting and I enjoy all the great products.

				haha, yeah I spent a crap-load of time on SR.. but then again I always have messages to answer, orders to check etc. <br /><br />I was harsh panicking this morning when SR wasn&#039;t loading as I had just sent out almost 18 orders and still had to get paid for them....&nbsp;

				I&#039;d be flipping out if this place disappeared as well, but ultimately I think this sort of thing is going to be the future. Should the worst happen, something will take SR&#039;s place, maybe not overnight but it will happen.

				When I found this place, I&#039;ve just stay here for hours looking with kid&#039;s eyes this showroom of almost pure drugs ... Totally different game, White-collar Dealers with Respectfull and fair buyers (with the reviews). After the discovery it has been an habits and now, almost everyday I check SR for 30min / an hour since I&#039;ve improved security ( Linux for SR ) and it&#039;s still so enjoyable ! Can&#039;t wait for my first order to arrive. Thanks SR.

				My real life has been put on hold since I realized how f***ing unreal this thing is. Imagining all kinda different scenarios non-stop, constantly checking forum and the market, but also freaking out because the bitcoin currency is appreciating every day now and afraid that the whole world will flood the forum soon.
