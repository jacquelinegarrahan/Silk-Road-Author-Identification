				Could be more than a week. They are fat soluble so it sticks around longer than some other drugs. It will vary greatly from person to person though based on lifestyle. For anyone that uses drugs and could ever possibly have to take a test I highly recommend you go buy a bunch of tests yourself and see what&#039;s up. They are pretty cheap in head shops or online. Anyway I don&#039;t think benzos are tested for in normal tests.

				A far as a urine test, it will take about 6 weeks for valium to clear your system.&nbsp; Like the above poster, it varies person to person.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how long for blood tests or for klonopin.<br />

				Yeah benzos are one that can vary hugely from person to person. Could be 2 weeks could be six. If there&#039;s something serious hanging on the test then as the above says, test yourself first.

				I am underweight and have a fast metabolism and I have taken Klonopin THE NIGHT BEFORE A DRUG TEST and I passed! <br />That being said klonopin and xanax are usually out of your system within 48-72 hours (blood maybe a little shorter).<br />Once you hit 96 hours, you should be fine as long as you are drinking alot of water and you are not super overweight

				Yeah, if you can switch over to Xanax as the test approaches.&nbsp; It&#039;s got a half life of about five hours and its metabolites are gone in less than a day.<br /><br />Then go back to your long-term fucked ups k-pins and whatnot. ;)

				valium has one of the longest detection times partly because of its long half life but also because of how many metabolites it has and there half lifes.

				I take urine drug tests every 2 weeks. I can say for sure that Valium by far takes the longest to be undetectable from urine due to its half-life. Last time I took Valium for 4 days in a row at 1 dose a day of 40mg, so once a night for 4 days I took 40mg of Valium (4 10pm pills), and then stopped and I was still testing positive for 8 weeks after I stopped taking it.<br /><br />Stick with clonozapam or Xanax, leaves your system much faster...
