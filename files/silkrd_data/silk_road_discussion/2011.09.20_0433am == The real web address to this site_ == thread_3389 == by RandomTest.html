				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m a new user here, and ultimately plan on being a reputable seller/buyer.<br /><br />I made an account under the web address of the .onion link listed on the Wiki page for the Silk Road (the regular, non-Tor internet Wiki). Turns out that after going through the Tor version of the &quot;Hidden Wiki&quot; page, it claims that the link I used to sign up for Silk Road was a phishing link.<br /><br />The claimed phishing link: http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/<br /><br />The supposedly real link (Silk Road #2): http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page - it says not to sign up through this link using hidden Wiki, which is where I got it from. So the phisher is admitting he is phishing... ? I guess phishers aren&#039;t too smart.<br /><br /><br />Why is there a Silk Road #2? Is there actually two of the same website?<br /><br />It seems as though every link I go to says every other link is a phishing link. What is the REAL link to the REAL Silk Road.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll wait for some posts from reputable members/sellers. For all I know I will get a ton of phishing links posted.

				http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion<br /><br />That is the real URL.<br /><br />You are instructed NOT to link in from the hidden wiki because peopel replace the real SR link with a phishing page and farm a few dozen user/pass combos (and swipe the BTC) before it gets caught and it gets changed back - it&#039;s a wiki.&nbsp; There is only ONE SR.<br /><br />Save the URL on a truecrypt volume or something or memorize it, and when you go to the site just directly enter it into your browser.&nbsp; never go to SR any other way.&nbsp; This will ensure you are always hitting the real login page and not letting some bastard hop on and grab your $200 in BTC&#039;s you&#039;ve just transferred in to buy my product ;)

				A cool (sorta) method for finding this place is also via the gawker or wired articles in google. Useful if you have to here from another pc that&#039;s got no bookmark.

				And once you&#039;re here, it&#039;s relatively easy to remember that it starts with ian and ends with ulzz, so you can just keep that in mind whenever you find yourself navigating to it from a new computer or something. Won&#039;t help you get here on its own, but should help make sure you aren&#039;t trusting the wrong link.

				How about this:<br />http://tinyurl.com/thesilkroad<br /><br />goes to: http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/<br />as you can see here: http://preview.tinyurl.com/thesilkroad<br /><br />Of course I can&#039;t promise TinyURL won&#039;t hijack that link, but it seems unlikely.<br /><br />Also made this, you can guess where it goes:<br />http://tinyurl.com/silkroadforun

				HiddenWiki bad?&nbsp; Like life, bad and good come together in the same box.<br /><br />I am no fan of people who will take advantage of people&#039;s ignorance/innocence or lack of experience. Especially when they steal from them in the process.<br />But everyone who&#039;s ever been burned one way or another has received something for their costs......experience.<br /><br />Remember, we live in a world where nearly every inch of land has been claimed by some &quot;ruler&quot; and usually make the claim that it is to protect us. The culture gets rife with the idea that someone is there looking after them, when they are not. The only time the criminals calling themselves government actually protect anyone is either totally by coincidence or when is is THEIR best interest to do so.<br /><br />Fact is that even if they were pure in their intentions what they claim is impossible in practice. Police draw great chalk outlines but only by accident happen upon an act of deadly violence in time to stop it.<br /><br />So here is my point: the guy that ripped you off last, (hopefully one or two times is enough) while being a scumbag, at least did you the service of helping to de-program the cultural side effect of all of this &quot;protection&quot;, namely weakening your own horse sense defense systems.<br /><br />Bookmark it, write it down, memorize it (after a while you will just know if it looks wrong in the address bar anyway) but always remember that while there are good sources like the HW for info the very nature of it (and of our attempts at anonymity) lend themselves to scumbags.<br /><br />In the end we want people who are smart, alert and hard to fool in our &quot;society&quot; and a few minor burnings are actually as natural to producing that as&nbsp; predators are to producing smarter prey animals.<br /><br />As for LE sucks.....that&#039;s only because the Law has been hijacked and perverted into an instrument of plunder. And even then a blanket statement like &quot;all LE sucks&quot; isn&#039;t true.<br />In a world where the law was just, where it was nothing but a collective )and NON monopolistic) effort to reinforce the individuals own right to defense against plunder, LE would great. And there would many different LE organizations to choose from, competition keeping any one vendor from getting the &quot;swagger&quot; so well known to be held by so many (but not all) government monopolist LE agencies.<br /><br />In that world the only people who anything to fear from LE in here would be the scammers.....and you could actually CALL LE (the one of your choice) in to help you!<br />Of course we wouldn&#039;t be hiding in here in the first place.<br /><br />Read&nbsp; &nbsp; Frederic Bastiat&#039;s&nbsp; &quot;The Law&quot; &quot;What is Seen and What is Not Seen&quot; is worthwhile as well.<br />That is after committing the SR addy to memory or safe storage. The one put up by Anarco47, the real one.<br /><br />
