				Yes, I am haveing the exact same concern here - and also am looking to make a purchase, but am holding off.&nbsp; Can nothing be done to offset the instability issue presented by the fluctuation of Bitcoin rates?&nbsp; Because, what will then happen if Bitcoin rates continue to rise indefinately, which some are expecting to happen, indeed?&nbsp; Can there be some kind of medium between the parties of sale and purchase? For example, sellers name their price in terms of a normal global currency (for example, Dollars), and then the Bitcoin price is adjusted in relation to that named price?&nbsp; That would seem to solve the issue, although I am of course skeptical that such action would be taken. However, I am hopeful that SOMETHING is done to deal with this, or otherwise, do you suppose that sellers simply will adjust THEIR selling price to account for the rising bitcoin rates? Is there something about the &#039;Escrow&#039; system I am missing here? Any answers are greatly appreciated, Thank You.

The seller defines the items price in $ and on the products page the corresponding BTC value is shown, which changes when BTC goes up or down.
