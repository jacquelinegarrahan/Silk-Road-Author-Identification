				Asked this question the SR vendor support a couple of days ago.<br /><br />Their answer:<br />Something like 10, but it is depending on the amounts and quantities ordered; it is not an exact number of transactions.<br /><br />cheers

				I wondered this myself because I had over 300 transactions and no percentage rating. All of my listings are digital and under $10, but as soon as I sold a physical product for over $10, I immediately got a number by my name. Maybe it has to do with price of your listings?

				Items over $10 count, items under $10 do not count. (Always true)<br /><br />And then there&#039;s also something about needing a minimum of 4 transactions. It seems a bit more finicky than that, in truth, but the price-limit is something that was enacted as a response to a large scam after one guy got a fuckton of feedback on a lottery all saying 5/5 and built up 300 transactions... then he switched over to moneypak-scamming and a lot of people got ripped off.<br />
