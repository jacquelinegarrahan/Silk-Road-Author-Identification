				I&#039;m currently using ketamine to fight my depression.&nbsp; It&#039;s only been couple months and it&#039;s been working well so far.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a strict regimen or dosing, I just kind of eyeball it and snort it whenever I feel like my depression is seeping back in.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know if there are anyone out there who&#039;s used ketamine as an antidepressant and how it worked out for them in short and long-term and what their regimen was.<br /><br />Thanks.

				why dont u just buy some b-12 , b3, alpha lipoic acid 1200 mg per day and some lithium orotate.<br />that would work better and cost less.<br />dont be scared by the lithiun its 5mg and over the counter.<br />wtf is depresion? i take it and dont have any!!<br />keeps the pms away - but i doubt u needed to know that lol&nbsp; :P<br /><br />what that combo does is return ur brain chemistry to normal whatever the fuck that is&nbsp; :)

				Haha You&#039;re a funny fellow Christy. I&#039;ve used Methoxetamine for depression, and it has worked wonders I was completely I&#039;m not sure if I can even find a word to describe what I was lol.<br />I am not depressed anymore to say the least, I am not who I was before I was depressed (in a sense as we all change some in do time) <br />

				didn&#039;t work for me but it was fun! The best remedy I have found is daily (or at least every other day) exercise (any movement to get the juices flowin) and good healthy eating and maybe some supplemental vitamins and minerals to be sure you&#039;re getting what you need. just feeling like im taking care of myself by doing these things, let alone the physical benefits, makes me feel good, which reenforces the process. I have heard of studies in Houston, Tx testing the effects of ketamine as an anti depressant (actually the day after I first tried it I heard that on the radio, NPR i believe). for some certainly an extra dose of something is needed. for me though i feel like a daily dose of the chemicals released during a run, or swim really have an immediate and a cumulative effect that i think raises my base line happiness level over time. its getting over the hump that&#039;s the hard part but once the clarity from movement and good eating has been experienced its obvious how important and helpful it is.

				I usually hole at least once a week to an album of my choice and occasionally toss some in with whatever other psychedelic I&#039;m on every so often and it doesn&#039;t so much as get rid of my negative emotions but rather gives me a different outlook and motivation to kick ass for the rest of the week so I can explore my mind once again a few days later. It does leave an absolutely wonderful afterglow though which helps. :D<br /><br />Just make sure to take a break from it every once in awhile, it has the potential to be habit forming without a doubt so make each time count by turning it into a ritual or form of meditation to really sort your shit out on it.

				I&#039;ve read about K as an anti-depressant and I think it&#039;s very interesting. Supposedly it helps restore neural pathways involving a brain compound called glutamate, I believe, which may be responsible for its anti-depressant characteristics. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really suffer from depression myself (excepting the occasional grumpy mood), but I have been using K in small doses (~50mg) for the past month about once or twice a week, and I can tell you that I have felt somehow more resistant to bad moods in between K doses. It seems in the past month I&#039;ve had a greater ability to ignore negative thoughts and feelings. I tend not to dwell on things lately. I simply move forward from life&#039;s little issues without letting them bother me. I suppose this could be attributed to the K.<br /><br />I know some people experience come-downs involving depression with MDMA, but actually, I have found that MDMA is a great anti-depressant for me as well, long after I come down. I have never experienced depression post-MDMA. On the contrary, I find it renews my positive outlook on life for a good long time. I have been a happier and more positive person in the past 2 years since using MDMA...

				I inadvertently discovered Ketamine could treat my depression.&nbsp; I bought some for recreational use, and the very next day I found my moderate to severe depression of 10+ years was utterly obliterated.&nbsp; It felt as though it had completely rewired my brain in a way that changed my thought processes -- the depressive thought patterns I had experienced for years were just gone.&nbsp; It still blows my mind that it&#039;s possible to feel *this* good on a daily basis without any drugs.&nbsp; Ketamine has been an absolute miracle drug for me, and I hope to see it FDA approved so others can (legally) experience this kind of relief.<br /><br />Answers to common questions I&#039;ve been asked:<br />&nbsp;- I used racemic Ketamine (I haven&#039;t found any literature examining the roles of each isomer for depression relief.&nbsp; For all I know Ketamine&#039;s antidepressant activity could be conferred by the R-isomer, although I think this is unlikely.&nbsp; In clinical trials they administered racemic, so that&#039;s what I&#039;m sticking to). <br /><br />&nbsp;- I started with an initial dose of 50 mg IM, and upped it to 100 mg IM for the next several doses.&nbsp; Studies seem to indicate depression relief can be achieved at much lower doses (even subpsychoactive doses), but I was using it recreationally sooo...I have no interest in lower dosages.<br /><br />&nbsp;- How it works*:&nbsp; Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, seems to cause an immediate and rapid increase in &quot;synaptic plasticity.&quot;&nbsp; This is a fancy term for making new connections -- how we form memories, associations, etc.&nbsp; It seems as though antagonizing the NMDA receptor causes an increase in a certain downstream protein called BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor).&nbsp; &nbsp;Low levels of BDNF are associated with stress and depression, and eventually lead to degeneration of vital connections in the hippocampus (your memory center).&nbsp; BDNF has been shown to play a key role in promoting synaptic plasticity (new connections) and is likely the mechanism by which Ketamine reverses depression.<br /><br />&nbsp;- Placebo effect?&nbsp; Something I found impressive -- one study showed depression relief in a large percentage of those administered Ketamine, while none (0%) of those administered placebo reported any relief.&nbsp; Interesting that there was no placebo effect at all.&nbsp; I found this study after I had tried Ketamine as I figured any depression relief I would experience would just be a placebo effect because I had heard about the clinical trials.&nbsp; A placebo effect is most certainly not the case for me.<br /><br />*From what I have gathered from a quick review of the primary literature and what I can remember from my medical school neuroscience course.

				I took MXE or DXE.&nbsp; Forgive me, I am not exactly sure what the correct letters are but I was told it was similar to or had properties of Ketamine.&nbsp; It was an intense fun psychedelic experience and the next day I felt better than I had in years.&nbsp; I have a tendency toward depression so this joyfulness was amazing and it lasted several days.&nbsp; I attributed this turn around in my depression at the time to the Ketamine or Ketamine-like qualities of what I took. <br /><br />I have since learned that Ketamine is very effective in the treatment of migraine headaches, another problem I suffer from.&nbsp; I am definitely very interested in getting me some Ketamine!!!<br /><br />Thanks for the info folks!

				IM injections may be more effective but I personally feel that most people will benefit from just snorting ketamine.&nbsp; Just finely grind the crystals with a metal spoon or something.<br /><br />Some people say, they like to take smaller doses daily and others say they like taking bigger doses infrequently.<br /><br />I have been experimenting with different dosing regimens.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t like the small daily dose regimen.&nbsp; Taking smaller doses rather makes me feel irritable and flat at times.<br /><br />At this point, I believe taking higher dose every 5-10 days seem to work better.&nbsp; Plus, I don&#039;t think taking ketamine on daily basis would be healthy since there are reports of withdrawal syndrome.&nbsp; Thus, taking breaks in duration of 5-10 days may work better while minimizing dependence and long-term side effects.<br /><br />Ketamine will be a &quot;reset&quot; button on your reality.&nbsp; It will make you feel very vulnerable like an infant being born.&nbsp; This is the time where your mind is very mendible.<br /><br />Make sure to be in positive and calm environment and listen to some good music or positive messages whether in forms of video or audio you can find on youtube or so on.<br /><br />I may also try S-isomer in the future and see how it differs from racemic ketamine.&nbsp; <br /><br />For those who are want to fight depression, also look into psilocybin mushrooms.&nbsp; Clinical data suggests that shrooms can indeed help with anxiety and depression. <br /><br />Currently, I am convinced that weekly ritual of ketamine / psilocybin may be far more effective in long-run than the anti-depressants on the market at the moment.

And I haven&#039;t seen anyone do a comparison (which would probably be pretty hard to do anyways).<br /><br />Well, this thread motivated me to place an order for a gram of S isomer. Thanks OP and everyone who&#039;s contributed, and I&#039;ll keep you guys updated as to how it works for me. :)

Anywho, if you&#039;re too impatient for that just grind up a tiny amount to snort and just keep going at it until you start to feel your mind free itself from your cranium. Being on ketamine is like dreaming while awake, but not everyone can learn to enjoy it like the rest of us.

				sorry to tell ya the L orotate wont cause any damage at all and is 5mg a day.<br />your brain actually needs it to function properly. u have been taking it all of your life in the food u eat - prolly just didn&#039;t know it\ <br />i think ur confused with the prescription lithium - i would never tell anyone to take that - its poison!<br />it&#039;s like 5 or 6 bucks a bottle for 30 days - seriously give it a try - u wont be disappointed!

				I took Lithium Orotate when I was depressed and even taking a quarter pill (!) I was constantly - constantly - dying of thirst. So I can completely believe kidney damage is a possibility with more. You feel sedated. It makes your thinking fuzzy. It messes with your endocrine function. Especially thyroid, which is in itself one of the major causes of depression. Whatever Christy and the internet try to tell you, it is the same lithium that they use on psych wards but with an orotate ion instead of a carbonate. Do NOT waste your money or your time. Leave that hippy fairy dust for people looking for magic beans.<br /><br />On the contrary what did cure my depression - and my mom&#039;s - was just the basics: <br /><br />100mg Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (B6) <br />800mcg Methylfolate (B9)<br />&nbsp;&gt;1mg Dibencozide (B12) <br />&gt;15mg Optizinc<br />&nbsp;&gt;500mg Carlson EPA Fish Oil<br />250mg Genceutic Naturals Curcumin BCM-95<br /><br />Also EXERCISE EXERCISE EXERCISE!<br /><br />I mention the best forms/brands because I only ever found certain ones to actually work. And I have tried EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Proper nutrition etc won&#039;t be enough for everyone but it will give you the best shot possible.
