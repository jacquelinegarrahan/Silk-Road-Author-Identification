				I&#039;ve been a good, quiet, patient Vendor through all this bullshit the last 3 weeks....but this is REALLY getting unbearable and ridiculous at this point.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve seen NO change to the site from what it was before 2 weeks ago. Connectivity problems are still evident.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only been able to actually get logged in an average of 2 times a day for the last week, after hours of trying.......WHO&#039;S RUNNING THIS SHOW??&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is obviously evident they are NOT DOING A GOOD JOB.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I appreciate that SilkRoad exists, i really do, but COME ON GUYS!&nbsp; &nbsp; FIX THIS SHIT!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;With all do respect.......<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yes, I agree!&nbsp; This is BULLSHIT!&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if it&#039;s fucking Thanksgiving, someone should be manning the password server to make sure that not only does SR not lose a shitload of money from sales revenue, but that vendors and customers alike can get on the site and do their thing!!!<br />From what I can see, the fucking password server is down, and no one can get into the damn site!<br /><br />GET IT TOGETHER - PLEASE!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Get the site up and KEEP THE DAMN THING UP!&nbsp; &nbsp;ALRIGHT ???????&nbsp;

				They will get it fixed. I don&#039;t expect SR to have the same amount of servers as google or anything. If they did it wouldn&#039;t be to hard for the powers that be to hunt them down and fuck this shit up permanent like
