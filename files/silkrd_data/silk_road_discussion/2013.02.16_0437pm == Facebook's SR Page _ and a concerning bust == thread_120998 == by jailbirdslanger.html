				I was on facebook earlier snatchin some pictures of a friend of mine thats no longer before his FAM removes his profile. I hadn&#039;t been on facebook in over 2 months due to my new years resolution.<br /><br />I looked up to see if SR had a facebook. Yes, SR has a FB page, now how official I don&#039;t know. I was wondering if it is official. Does anyone know? I searched &#039;facebook silk road&#039; on the forums with a return of 3 results, nothing indicating what I was looking for.<br /><br />Anyway I happened to see some post on it that said some guy in Salem area of either NH, or MA got busted Jan 25 on 5 elbows. Someone at the destination location had signed for the package that originated in CALI. Now who the fuck would sign for a domestic package, IDK. However I do like that I saw this on FB, even if the page is unofficial. The link didnt say whether he used SR or not, but damn 5 elbows goin from CALI to the east coast? I&#039;d def say small chance of the guy that got busted actually grew up in CALI and had that connect. Here is the link to the news article:<br />http://salem-nh.patch.com/articles/salem-man-charged-after-receiving-drugs-in-mail<br /><br />First off this guys grandma or something signed for it, secondly, the package had a false return address/name? <br /><br />If the facebook page is official thats all good, because each source we have to obtain news like this will benefit all of our causes. <br /><br />Let me know whats up , I&#039;m def sure others are interested.<br />

				Do yourself a big favor, and stay away from any connection between Facebook and SR.&nbsp; The two should never meet.&nbsp; LE took awhile to discover social media, but they got it, and they know how to exploit it.&nbsp; Do you think it&#039;s an accident that you see ads for things that you&#039;ve searched?&nbsp; If you become the target of a narcotics investigation, your activities on FB will be exploited.&nbsp; The fact that you have browsed pages related to SR could become PC for a warrant for your computer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m normally not the &quot;Oh, my God, the black helicopters are coming for you!&quot; kind of guy, but this one is near and dear.&nbsp; Keep your FB life and your criminal life in two separate worlds.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t, the one will give the other away.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the advice sleepyeyes2k2. Ya I don&#039;t stress like that, I just made the post because last night I saw that a vendor I&#039;ve used before had a review in his thread that said the postmaster sent him a letter in the mail saying the package got seized. I really like to read about these busts. I&#039;ve been utilizing usps for a long time now and haven&#039;t had any problems. It seems like more people get busted for bigger amounts.. now how that is I don&#039;t know, it would def be worth researching lolol

				Yeah, seriously, folks - compartmentalize your drug and SR-related life from the rest of your life with as much discipline as you can.

				Guys in case you didn&#039;t know facebook is literally the worst site on the entire internet for privacy. Literally the worst. They don&#039;t delete content, even when you pull a picture. If you have a direct link to it you can get back to it after it has been &quot;deleted&quot;. Literally everything you do on FB is tracked. They have word scanners too to auto-alert the authorities. If you log into facebook while on the run, they will track you. I don&#039;t know how many news stories I&#039;ve seen where the only way the dumbass got arrested was cause he logged into facebook, or posted pics of him smoking weed/snorting coke.

				I kicked the FB habit around the same time I discovered SR! <br /><br />I wanted all my energy and time, that I was wasting on assholes I never hung out with&nbsp; in HS, and never would IRL had it not been for that bastard child program of some nerd wanker who happened to be in the right place at the right time. (The most fucked up time in history, for this half century-old geezer!)<br /><br />Thank God I have access to all of these drugs now! - The things that I started to notice people making a big deal about. The insane &quot;Celebrity Culture&quot; I found myself living in, made me feel alienated. <br /><br />I sold my 52&quot; TV, cut the cord on the cable+Phone. The internet I can pick up from neighbors. <br /><br />What I see being billed as &quot;important&quot; or &quot;something I absolutely must see&quot;. - I wonder. &quot;Am I the earthling, and they&#039;re the alien, or the other way around?&quot;<br /><br />Either way, I know I&#039;m not like THEM&nbsp; - and happily so !

				Hear Hear jagfug! I&#039;d give up the tv as well if my wife would let me.&nbsp; I refuse to pay for cable though.&nbsp; We have an internet bill and prepaid, no data cell phones and that&#039;s it.&nbsp; I need to unplug from this laptop more often as well.&nbsp; We are moving in the correct direction though!

				Agreed with everything above--FB makes you more exposed than pretty much any other thing on the entire internet.&nbsp; Stay out.<br /><br />But on an unrelated note, there are plenty of people who have coast-to-coast IRL hookups.&nbsp; It&#039;s not as uncommon as you think.&nbsp; It&#039;s been going on like that for years...long before SR came around--it&#039;s not like elbows were never put into the USPS system until a couple years ago.

				I&#039;m just going to reinforce what everybody&#039;s been saying. Don&#039;t tie your facebook with anything illegal doings! I thought it&#039;d be common sense but don&#039;t join a page that has to do with illegal activity.&nbsp; It can very well comeback and bite you in the ass<br />Better yet, just get rid of your facebook or any form of social media
