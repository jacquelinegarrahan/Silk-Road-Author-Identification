				Hi fellas,<br />I&#039;ve lurked around for a while but recently decided to take the plunge and actually buy something on SR. One problem though, which leaves me in a sort of dilemma. <br />The product I want, from the seller I&#039;d like to buy from has a condition: If product value is greater than &gt;25% of buyer&#039;s total purchase value, FE is required. Obviously, I have $0 buying history. And I can&#039;t afford to spend $600 just so I can buy $150 worth of goods without FE.<br /><br />The seller seems trusted, with 100% feedback but only about a month or so history. What should I do?

				Honestly, I&#039;m not sure how it is across all vendors but there doesn&#039;t seem to be many left that will let you stay in Escrow if you have no buying history at all. <br /><br />You could try negotiating with the vendor but it&#039;s unlikely to work (particularly since they&#039;ve detailed their policies on their page).<br /><br />My advice (as a buyer) would be to try and locate a vendor that allows new buyers to stay in Escrow (they&#039;re around, just takes research - all my first transactions were in Escrow). Or you could take the risk depending on the feedback. A month doesn&#039;t seem like a long time for a vendor account but if in that month they&#039;ve done 800 transactions and have no bad feedback then the odds are in your favor but it&#039;s still a risk.

				You really should take the time and learn the finer points of this community and how to be secure. and make a few smaller buys before you splurge on a big purchase.<br /><br />and also, It is not unheard of for even some of the most trusted sellers around to selectively scam newb buyers on a big first-time purchase like that.<br /><br />some food for thought

				Thanks Dr Gonzo and Aligibbs.<br />Is it inherently unsafe for the vendor to go into escrow with a new buyer? Or just inconvenient? I would imagine it wouldn&#039;t be too hard to prove if a new buyer is attempting to scam?<br />I am domestic so I don&#039;t see any way the mail could get confiscated, either...

				The fact is that a new buyer is an unknown quantity in the sellers eyes (especially a brand new/ no transaction account) and for all they know you could be a competeing vendor that&#039;s trying to give them bad rep.<br /><br />And as far they know you could also be a scammer buyer thats gonna try to use the resolution center to get a full/partial refund or reshippment (double the drugs)<br /><br />So in a vendors mind:<br />the least negative worst case scenario is that they will get undeserved negative feeback<br />and in the worst case scenario they could be getting scammed<br /><br />all in all you have to tread lightly as a new buyer and feel things out slowly.<br />establish a connection with a vendor before you buy from them and always start out small.<br /><br />given enough time you will eventually find a reliable hook up with a vendor that you trust.

				Thanks again, doc.<br /><br />When you say start small, what sort of quantity/dollar value are we talking?<br />I would love to have the option of starting with a vendor who accepts escrow -- but the product I am looking for is only available from one vendor at the moment.

				I dont know exactly what your after.... but your first couple of buys should be small ammounts of easy shit.<br />Like i gram of weed, or a couple of pills, etc....<br /><br />Anything larger will look suspicious to the vendor for a first-time buyer

				Hi there, I am a brand new buyer and user of Silkroad, so a newb as well.&nbsp; And maybe I was being blonde but it took ages to get Bitcoins and get them sent into my SR account!&nbsp; Anywhay, I bought 2 small-ish items and the orders are now currently &quot;processing&quot;.&nbsp; I sent a msg to both sellers that I would finalise early, and they are both top-rated sellers.&nbsp; My 2 purchases:&nbsp; I bought 1g of coke from the Netherlands, here to the UK; and 2 pills from&amp;to the UK.&nbsp; My question is: was that a small enough order and am I doing everything correctly so far?&nbsp; I want to being doing my best for the seller if this will be a good product but I also don&#039;t want to be scammed...<br /><br />

				I&#039;m in the same boat as Jennyem above me, but I started with a 10 strip of blotter, and a 1/2 gr on DMT, each from different vendors. Is that too much for a first time buy?

				Personally it doesn&#039;t matter if the first buy is too big if you are willing to FE. I have FE&#039;d for almost all my purchases even though I am above 15 transactions because I now trust the sellers.
