				I recently ordered a few ounces of weed from a vendor on here. I thought it was great so I went back and bought a whole pound. Now a few of my customers are telling me the shit is sprayed with either a solvent or jwh.<br />They say this because the weed sparkles apparently. Someone lit up a bowl in front of me and the weed actually sparkled. Is this an indicator of sprayed weed?

				Sparkling could be from something as simple as not flushing properly.<br /><br />What you need to do is get a 25-50x scope (ideally) and if it&#039;s sprayed you will notice glass like substance on your buds. <br /><br />If it&#039;s not sprayed it will just have your normal trichomes visible which you can google for a accurate image of that.

				Wait, are you talking about sparks/sparking or sparkling? Because good weed is supposed to sparkle, due to being loaded with trichomes which are the glands containing the yummy resin that gets you high.<br />Sparking on the other hand is usually a sign of excess nutrients being left in the bud due to not being flushed properly towards the end of the grow cycle.<br />Hope this helps

				in the UK a few years ago there was an influx of &#039;sprayed&#039; cannabis. some of it had sugar syrup on it which when dried added weight, other bud was gritty and you could feel the &#039;crystals&#039; like dust. some research into the subject and it was found out that it was microscopic silica dust, blown onto the plants while growing. adding huge added weight to grows.<br /><br />eventually after a few months it dissapeard. im sure its still about on some base level street dealers menu somewhere though.<br /><br />END PROHIBITION.

				I had we&#039;d that sparked and flared up.&nbsp; It was too much fertilizer and not flushed and also spider mite bodies and eggs.&nbsp; Sometime infestation of spider mites makes the weed do strange things but too much fertilizer always burns the lips when smoking it and burns fast and hot.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would be surprised anyone would add something to weed.&nbsp; I mean c&#039;mon now.&nbsp; It would make bad feedback and vendor rating. Who would chance it?&nbsp; Just for weed?&nbsp; I think it&#039;s something else .&nbsp;

				i don&#039;t know... nl based vendor djabbar has sold vast quantities of sprayed weed on here in the past. i&#039;m not sure if he&#039;s still a vendor but he mentioned the fact it was sprayed in the listing not the title. he claimed it was not harmful and just added weight. i never bought that, literally or figuratively. <br />is the ash hard and black? does it not burn right? if so i&#039;m going to say bad flush is the most innocent of explanations. sprayed or contaminated is also possible. either way it&#039;s not what it&#039;s supposed to be so you should really name the vendor unless you&#039;re still negotiating or something.

				Don&#039;t buy from that vendor again, and rate him 1/5 immediately.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s debatable how common this is, but it definitely exists. There&#039;s a LOT of shit weed on the silk road. It works because our median age is probably ~18 and we&#039;re a VERY uninformed consumer base. Also buying sight unseen. Prohibition is an awful thing.<br /><br />I want you guys to be very very skeptical of any and all things you buy on the silk road, and stop being so liberal with your 5/5s. It makes it really hard to tell who&#039;s deserving of the 5. If you give all 5/5s or all rave reviews, then your reviews and recommendations mean very little.&nbsp; 8)

				As a medical grower/smoker of over 20 years, I can attest from personal experience that &quot;sparkling&quot; weed can be produced by several factors, but by far the most common two causes in my experience are<br /><br />#1 Phosphorous. One of the three &quot;macro&quot; nutrients our beautiful ladies use to grow. If too much Phosphorous is used and not thoroughly flushed you get a very acrid flavor and a weed that can spark, Phosphorous is is used in flares too lol<br />#2 Insects, of which Spider Mites are the most common. A heavy spider mite infestation will cause a very sparkly effect when burned due to all the little insect bodies popping and burning. if you use a scope you can see those nasty little Borg fuckers!<br /><br />There are different things people spray on to increase weight, usually sugar based solutions. You could always take a bud and water cure it and see what comes off it, that&#039;ll give you some idea and it might make it more smokeable if the problem is phosphorous!<br /><br />

				Yeah, I lost an entire crop once to spider mites, was disgusting, they turn the entire plant from the inside out into a giant hive nest of web. The weed was nasty, I normally sell my herb for top dollar locally but that harvest i turned the entire thing into bubble hash to get rid of those fuckers. It doesn&#039;t effect the high at all, but depending on the density it will definitely effect flavor. burning heavily infested bud looks almost like those little snake puck things people get for the fourth of July that you light on fire and they grow into snakes while they burn. The bud will just sort of spark and sizzle. Very depressing to see great quality herb taken over by the Borg :(. The only thing about it that is more unappealing than smoking thousands of those little fuckers is using a 30x+ scope on the weed and watching those hideously ugly little fuckers walking around on the bud. They are just BARELY visible to the naked eye and only if you really know what to look for, although a heavy infestation you can look at what parts of the leaves were left on during trimming and possibly see damage from them there depending on the level of infestation.

				Hello everyone :),<br /><br />As a grower for over 25 years and a vender here on SR,,,,,I will give you my thoughts on this issue.&nbsp; It all comes down to &quot;what do you really want to do&quot;/&nbsp; Growing Indoor Dank....is not easy....not at all....my room is<br />&#039;clean green certified&quot;.....Gets inspected and re-certified every year.....the program i am in requires the grower to keep very accurate records as what is used to grow, pick from a approved list of OMRI approved products,<br />it the Marijuana&#039;s version of organic.....since the word &quot;organic&quot; is owned by the federal government...and requires very specific guidelines to become a &#039;certified organic farmer&quot;..you have to pay a large fee and then pass all<br />inspections of soil....tissue samples of existing plants and all nutrients used in growing....the cost to be a &quot;organic grower&quot; is huge.....since Marijuana is not a federally approved plant &quot;it can never be deemed organic....so the program &quot;clean&nbsp; green certified&quot; was born by a group of &quot;organic USDA inspectors&quot; for the medical marijuana market......currently there are less than 100 growers in the program.....for more information &quot;Google clean green marijuana&quot;.........any way.........no synthetic nutrients are allowed....of any kind....no sprays that are not OMRI certified .....none of that stuff that .makes you weed spark......it&#039;s a program where the grower takes great care in growing<br />the safest medical marijuana that can be grown......the learning curve is huge......and the yield is lower......but when dialed in....the best Marijuana in the world.<br /><br />For me the biggest problem.......people are only concerned with price....quality is second.........and there are lots of growers that will spray....very harmful chemicals on their crop to fight bugs.......I was hired last season to consult with some real big farms....i personally saw crops being sprayed with &quot;a bleach solution&quot; &amp; DDT......they men were in&nbsp; the white space suits....I ran over and asked what are you spraying this for....and they said &quot;we are not going to smoke it&quot;....so we do not care....... :-[........I could not believe it.<br /><br />All I can say is.....&quot;you get what you pay for&quot;.....if you want cheap weed...be aware.......if you want high quality...be prepared to pay top dollar for it......<br /><br />It&#039;s a easy choice for me.....i want the best....and I want to grow the best for my customers........<br /><br />my 02. cents

				I would never sell weed to anyone real-life, when it comes to weed for me it&#039;s just so important that my product is the best there is, so fuck off if you put glass in it - would you smoke that urself?

				i disagree so ur telling me that if a vender is advertizing some dank weed and u get bunk shit u should give them 5/5 just cuz they sent some product?<br /><br />i agree with finalizing right when u get it but i dont see ANYTHING wrong with changing ur rating after u tried it.. u should all change it if its bunk.. <br /><br />reason being is what if the vender has been selective scamming?? then what? puting the rating lower and stating why after u try might help someone who just is looking through the feedback.. <br /><br />cuz lets face it venders sometimes scam newbs.. and whos gunna believe them on here? <br /><br />so.. LEAVE BAD FEEDBACK.. THATS JUST HOW IT HAS TO BE.. BUT FINALIZE WHEN U GET IT AND STATE U WILL UPDATE IF ITS BUNK OR NOT..&nbsp; a lot of people already do this.. ur tripping bro saying u should leave 5/5 so the vedners rep is perfect even tho they are scaming or selling BULLSHIT..

				Yeah giving a 5/5 just because someone sent you something is rediculous. I should give a vendor 5/5 for sending me some drywall instead of the stated fishscale? No one should have to sift through review threads that are hundreds of pages long to be able to tell if someone is a decent vendor is absurd!<br /><br />If people are scamming vendors, then the vendors should have scammer review threads in their forums to track those people... I bet they already do!

				Nah I kind of get what he&#039;s saying; that the feedback should not be influenced by subjective judgements like &quot;I found this weed to be harsh and more of a body load than the mental high I was promised 3/5&quot;. I get that. But if there is something properly wrong with the product such that it is not as advertised, then I would have thought the feedback was the appropriate place to mention this? Not everyone reads the review forums and there&#039;s a fair bit of shilling goes on there anyway.
