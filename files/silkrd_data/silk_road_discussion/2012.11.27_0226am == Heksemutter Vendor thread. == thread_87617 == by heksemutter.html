				5/5 all the way through! Ordered Nepali Suitcase Charas and got 2 samples of Pollen and Super Smoke! Quality hash, got very stoned with good body and head buzz, of only 0.2 gram of the Super Smoke. Can&#039;t wait to try the other two. <br />Awesome guy Heksemutter, will order again definately! <br /><br />Edit: Tried the Nepali Suitcase Charras. It is black as cole, and as soft as chewing gum, the hashish will almost instantly turn into oil when heat is applied(This is a very good sign) And quality is top. Got some awesome creative thinking. Again, only used about 0.2 gram. A philosophers stone certainly! And sorry for calling you a guy Heksemutter. Dunno why i pictured you as a guy when your nick is HekseMUTTER. Damn bear with me :) <br /><br />Will report back when Pollen has been tried.&nbsp;

				Hi.<br /><br />I&#039;ve received 0.54 of Super Smoke and 0.55 Pollen samples.<br />Since I rarely smoke hash,&nbsp; I was stunned just from 0.08 and if you count that I entertained some friends to help me up with it, then this was just enough for 12 times.<br />Super Smoke was more dry and hard to smoke. But Pollen I liked a lot. Effects was the same.<br />Unfortunately the price is not suitable for me. So I will continue to order cheap skunk&nbsp; ;D<br />And I would like to see wholesale prices.<br /><br />P.C. Fast delivery.<br /><br />Regards.<br />LL

				Review: Heksemutter- Pakistani<br /><br />Took 7 days from ordering arrive in the UK.<br /><br />The hash smells different from moroccan (I assume this is growin in morocco?) its got a smell like freshly chopped citusy plants mixed with a charasy sativa sweetness. Its quite soft pressed, crumbly not really sticky but if you work it you can make it into a sticky mold-able. Quite smooth in a pipe, very bubbly! Personally i find the effects warm and fuzzy centering in the brain, not a put you to sleep buzz but nice for relaxing.<br /><br />The vendor was also kind enough to include a sample of the pollen. I timed my order badly and the price of bitcoin went up by about 20% in the few days after I orderd! Anyway happy to get to try this without having to make a full order. This is like classic pollen sandy texture nice moroccan flavour more sativa effect. Think this one is possibly a nicer high, doesnt seem as oily as the pakistani. Hard to get to grips with the high as I had been smoking a lot and eating mushrooms before.
