				They keep falling. Everyday the weight average decreases. I&#039;m out! cashed them in. done. it will be funny if they fell to back to $12 now. the media had a field day bashing bitcoins and i see they to continue to fall. I wouldnt recommend holding on to them. buy them and trade them right away. Lesson learned.

				You wanna know what&#039;s funny. I purchase some btc right before the crash and got shorted so much I couldn&#039;t place my original purchase. So I bought more two days ago and it&#039;s fell so much again that I STILL won&#039;t have enough to place the order that I want when I get them. I honestly just laughed today and said fuck it. I also agree with you Snooze about the media bashing, I just keep thinking to my self if it weren&#039;t for all of the negativity surrounding btc in the media they have actually had a chance to stay above $100 for a bit longer.

				As soon as the bitcoin prices started climbing at such a high variance rate, I completed all purchases and converted back into&nbsp; a different currency.&nbsp; I prefer to avoid variance altogether rather than ride the rollercoaster and hope it ends on a high note.<br /><br />I wish people took the time to study basic concepts of economics.

				The reverse of what happened last week is happening now. The price continues to drop so it&#039;s natural for people to hol off buying them untill tomorrow when they&#039;ll be cheaper. This results in less buyers and more sellers and around and round we go.

				There in the $60&#039;s now. Weighted average time of OP $93 and change. now the weighted average is $83.39 its sinking. think about it, they were only $10 a coin in late October, $12 at Christmas. that&#039;s probably the true value for these coins. nobody who doesn&#039;t use bitcoins to buy things with will not invest in them. the media mocked it hard since the crash. Very unstable currency now, can&#039;t be good for anyone. <br />

				some good comments here. somepup and fractal. now everyone&#039;s had a taste of what life is like in an economy that doesn&#039;t have a stable currency, ie. Zimbabwe, 1930&#039;s Germany, 1980&#039;s Argentina. Investing in a currency, even a cryptocurreny, is fraught with risk. Risks that a non financial professional are not equipped to understand or undertake. The masses will just suffer the consequences of volatility. Can&#039;t buy food in Zimbabwe, can&#039;t buy drugs on SR, same difference. Just like you saw economic refuges leave Germany in the 1930&#039;s, you&#039;ll see many users AND vendors leave SR. I just hope SR doesn&#039;t spawn a Hitler like Germany did.

				<br /><br />(Newser) – The Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame/infamy are leading the charge on another digital frontier: the digital currency known as bitcoin. Their holdings translated to some $11 million in actual money, they say; that is, before values dropped drastically yesterday. But Tyler and Cameron are confident in their investment. &quot;People say it’s a Ponzi scheme, it’s a bubble,&quot; says Cameron.&quot;At some point that narrative will shift to &#039;virtual currencies are here to stay.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />Tyler puts it this way: &quot;We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error.&quot; The Winklevosses&#039; bitcoin portfolio seems to be among the largest out there, the New York Times reports, and they&#039;re being very careful with it. They&#039;ve put the coding behind their holdings on flash drives, which they placed in safe deposit boxes in three cities. But others aren&#039;t so sure the currency will hold up. &quot;To say (the investment is) highly speculative would be the understatement of the century,&quot; says an expert.<br />

				If I would have cashed out right when I saw it over $250, instead of being greedy and taking a chance I would have made a significant profit instead of losing. I was greedy and said &quot;i&#039;ll give it a few more days&quot; then it was down to $70 or something. Oh well. SR, BTC all new to me.

				I think to a lot of people didn&#039;t like that they spent $200 and got 1 bitcoin, especially when they were used to getting a lot more. Of course, they could buy 2 grams of coke or 3 grams of MDMA with that bitcoin, but that part didn&#039;t translate.<br />

It&#039;s because the establishment financial elites, that gets to sleep with all the MSM, don&#039;t want any competition. It&#039;s that simple. But I don&#039;t see any way for bitcoin to disappear doen the memory hole. If anything, it will make the banks and the fiat currencies hurt so much they will become practically useless, and the bond holders and stock holders will be royally fucked!<br /><br />goblin<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Winklevoss-brothers (facebook) invest in bitcoins, they own as they say, 1% of all coins. <br />Everybody know how stupid they are right ?? -sarcasm off- <br />Of course there are more &#039;&#039;big guys&#039;&#039; who invest but do not tell.....<br /><br />There is a saying...never gamble with money you cannot afford to loose.<br /><br />Same goes with buying coins...if you need to struggle to get the money to buy them...DON&quot;T !!<br />Have money you don&#039;t need for at least a year or so....buy!<br /><br />Gambling with money you cannot loose....you will panic because you see them drop or sell them when they go up a little....you need to sell...you need to because wowww now you make 300 dollar profit.<br />Stop kidding yourself....you just loose one way or another. Investing or play the market only possible without emotion and all I hear/see here is emotion&nbsp; ???
