				There are some online pharmacies.&nbsp; I have never used any but I do check out the reviews on Pharmacy Reviewer (clearnet).&nbsp; I have thought of placing orders but never have since the prices are usually only slightly lower or the same as SR.

There are some, for especially benzos, for cheaper or same price as SR rates, most have good customer service too, however, you risk getting scammed if you dont do your research on the site first!<br />I know 4 good ones off the top of my head...that are easily findable on google search

				the real pressing issue for some i would imagine, is opiates. if you have become &quot;accustomed&quot; (oh don&#039;t that sound nice!) to them, you will find it very difficult to weather their absence. any ideas in that area for our friends w/jobs &amp; families at stake? i assure you, small differences in price matter none in these conditions...&nbsp;

I was buying opiates from Mexican pharmacies before I ever heard of SR. There are some great clearnet forums out there. I think Drug Buyers went down (an absolute fucking shame) but Pharmacy Reviewer has a lot of old DB members, and a wealth of sources and information.

				To be totally honest, I&#039;m using other resources and holding off on hopping over to BMR. The only way I would try it right now is to buy from a trusted vendor from SR. But only if the vendor confirms on SR that they have setup shop at BMR. There are a lot of scammy listings over there. Seriously, I would say nearly half the listings you can automatically rule out upon reviewing them. I don&#039;t feel like BMR has a lot in place yet to deal with scams like SR does.<br /><br />Hope this whole fiasco makes them shape up over there though. :) would be nice to have competition.<br /><br /><br />if you&#039;ve got a good eye for scams and are an experienced buyer, I&#039;d say try out BMR.
