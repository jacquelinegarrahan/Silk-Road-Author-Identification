				Ordered a product 2.5 weeks ago. Didn&#039;t attend SR for a week, and realized it has already autofinalized my order.<br />It still hasn&#039;t arrived, it&#039;s coming from another continent, so I thought 2 weeks is normal delay.<br /><br />Is there anything I can do now?<br /><br />On another note: Do I have a reason to be afraid? Like, when the authorities catch a mail, what do they normally do? (I live in europe)<br /><br />Thanks

				In one word No. But you can always contact the vendor to try to resolve the issue. From my experience if you&#039;re a trusted buyer with good stats any reputable Vendor will try to get to a solution with you even if the order has already been autofinalized.<br /><br />-about the delay: if you have ordered from the us or canada it will be reasonable to say that the package should have been delivered by now, although it&#039;s not impossible that your order is still on it&#039;s way to you. i don&#039;t have enough information on Other continents.<br /><br />-about the possibility of interception and how it goes from there: it really differs from case to case. It depends on what country you&#039;re in and what/how Much you&#039;ve ordered. I can&#039;t really give a specific answer to your case as i don&#039;t know all the details but i&#039;ll suggest that you search in the forum with the name of your country as many users from different countries have already asked this question. (at least the big and &quot;busy&quot; countries has already been been covered).<br /><br />If i were you, i would contact my vendor explaining the problem.he&#039;ll tell you if additional time is needed for the package to be delivered And I&#039;m sure he has some valuable information thay can answer your questions. In most cases if you&#039;re both reasonable you&#039;ll reach an agreement that&#039;ll satisfy both parties. Good luck

				You just came in today,<br /><br />&nbsp;Your name looks the SPAMMER that takes the joy away !<br /><br />I do not trust you !<br /><br />You make a order and did not check here (You just registered)<br /><br />Then you don&#039;t come for a week or so?<br /><br />You do not even now how finalize works! BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO FINALIZE. Can not be done by the other (seller) site!<br /><br />Asking about MtGix gave you away, stupid!<br /><br />I say; YOU ARE THE SCAMMER !<br /><br />Proof me wrong or make sense, and stop the spam!<br /><br />
