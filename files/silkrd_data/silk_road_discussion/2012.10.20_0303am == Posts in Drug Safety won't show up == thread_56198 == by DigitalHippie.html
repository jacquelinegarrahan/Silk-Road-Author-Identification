				I made a nice little advice topic for first time psychedelic users. The post never showed up, and it said I&#039;m posting too fast (even though I haven&#039;t posted in at least 30 minutes). I then checked the drug safety board to see if my topic showed up, still nothing. I posted again and it said &quot;You posted this previously, you must have hit post twice or the refresh key&quot; which i didn&#039;t. I thought in my head &quot;well, maybe I did on accident, who knows&quot; checked Drug Safety, topic still not there.

				sometime it just gives an error, i think it says the last post from your IP was less than 2 sec ago. then if you try to submit again it wont work for some reason<br /><br />you need to copy the text of the post and go back to the thread, then hit reply again. paste and try to re-submit<br /><br />its cause everyone appears to be on the IP 127.0.0.1 to the forum somehow<br /><br />thats also why you can get the search error about having to wait 5 sec to search again

				Just tried just now. It worked, thank you :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why they have the IP filter, doesn&#039;t everyone&#039;s IP address come up as localhost (127.0.0.1), so I guess 2 people can&#039;t post at the same time or near each other.

				That answers a lot of questions. I have gotten the &quot;searched 5 seconds ago&quot; error so many times and was tripping out. Sometimes 5 searches in a row would return the error (not actually 5 seconds apart) and I thought something shady was going on. Good to know it&#039;s just a little fluke in the system. Thanks for that info. ::readjusts shiny metal hat::
