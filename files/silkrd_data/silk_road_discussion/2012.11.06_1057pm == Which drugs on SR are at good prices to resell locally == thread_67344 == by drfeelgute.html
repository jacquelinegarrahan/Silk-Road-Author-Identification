				A shitload. Some drugs on SR aren&#039;t for reselling, especially the coke and LSD listings.<br /><br />The easiest to resell IMO = NBOMe. Most vendors sell each tab for less than a buck a hit, and one hit will usually have you tripping.<br /><br />I&#039;m not about to list out all of the drugs you can make a profit on, because the list is already on SR itself. Look for what you&#039;re comfortable with selling, find the right vendor with reasonable prices, and invest in a .001 scale and some baggies/capsules. Consider buying a cheap prepaid phone for dealing.<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot to it, but it&#039;s easy enough.

				honestly, nbome has the most money in it. less than a dollar a hit, i charge 5 per hit, 150 per half sheet and 300 a sheet and make a lot of money.<br /><br />i also have great success in MDMA, DMT, 2c-x chems and mushrooms.

If u live in the states you can get mdma for less that 25 a gram of mdma and sell it for over 60 a g and nobody will complain because this is 100X better than anything they have had locally

				Shrooms here seem to be better priced and better quality than I&#039;ve seen irl, in addition to what&#039;s already been said.<br />I think the resale value of the NBOMe research chems are the lack of a catchy name; even other research chems have neat ones like 2cb-fly and bromo-dragonfly, even 2c-b, 2c-e etc are easy to remember, rather than going&nbsp; &quot;twenty-five eye enn bee etc...&quot;<br />I think we should come to a consensus for the street name, have the vendors use it on product pages. I bet this would be enough to coin one for the gp

				^ agreed, NBOMes need a street name and a way to get rid of the god awful taste - then they are totally the next best thing to MDMA and acid! I was thinking something that refers to the nature of the trip and the visuals; you know how everything looks like its melting and everything you touch feels like its liquid? Ideas?

				I move a lot of 25c-nBOME around and the most I&#039;ve heard as far as street names are &quot;nBOME&quot; or just &quot;tabs&quot;. Dudes around here just call em tabs or stamps. On Erowid it lists &quot;Solaris&quot; as a street name but I&#039;m calling bullshit. nBOMEs are cheapest for sure though, I easily sell them 10-15 per 800microgram tab of 25c.

				nbome is called N bomb sometimes<br /><br />and it is not supposed to be twenty five x nbome, at least given the chem structure <br /><br />it is two, five x - nbome as in 2,5-methoxy-4-x-PEA-Nbome <br /><br />and the price margins on it are ridiculous - doses can be bought for a few cents and sold for ten or fifteen dollars <br />id recommend c cause a gram goes further and i havent noticed reports of deaths from it only 25i so far

I&#039;m a smart dude and my customers know that, and it&#039;s catching on quick. <br />I started out buying it for myself because it was so cheap, sharing it with my friends and such but after a while word spread and here I am.

When I started I charged 15 a hit but I realized I was being crazy and now my terms are thus:<br />For first timers, you get one free sample. My treat. If you like it, come on back. If not, at least you got free drugs. Then if you&#039;re just coming around once a week or so it&#039;s 10 a hit or 2 for 15.

Pressed E, mushies and anything psychedelic is considered rare and elusive, like a goddamn unicorn. Out of the thousands of people I&#039;ve talked to about substances, only 2 or 3 are aware of MDMA (molly) and NOBODY has ever known what any research chem is (like 2cs and the nBOMEs). <br />It&#039;s crazy because E goes for 20-25 easily and everyone who let me use one of their pills for erlich testing never even had a hint of MDMA, I suspect just weak meth and caffeine, it&#039;s nothing like actual E.<br />High quality weed is 20-25 a gram (60-70 an 1/8th) and shrooms are the same damn price. I&#039;ve never met a single person who had real Lucy and I always stormed their consumer base by just hanging out with them and being friends with their friends, selling less than 100microgram tabs for 20 a piece easily. It&#039;s insane. Regular midquality weed is cheaper than anywhere I&#039;ve ever lived, 7g for 20USD.<br />I agree though, depending on the availability in your area, it&#039;s well worth it to pay a few extra bucks to get what might be unheard of where you live. Without the road I&#039;d only have access to crack heroin coke and weed. Which is just a bonus point to my business, as I can charge whatever I want (and I always go cheap). It&#039;s incredible how big a difference SR makes.

				Well I guess I&#039;m lucky that I have access to strong, cheap, legit LSD from a local source then.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried the NBOME series and I really just don&#039;t think they compare at all to quality LSD. I think it&#039;s a travesty that so many people are getting NBOME&#039;s thinking it&#039;s acid. I don&#039;t mind people selling it for what it is, it does have its perks (cheapness///accessability) but the amount of fake acid and greedy people out there now is just insane.<br /><br />50-60 an 8th of shrooms is also crazy as fuck. There is always a huge demand for shrooms though. Hell even the prices for them here on the SR are overpriced most of the time. I&#039;m lucky I get mine for free, and often give them away for free as well. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
