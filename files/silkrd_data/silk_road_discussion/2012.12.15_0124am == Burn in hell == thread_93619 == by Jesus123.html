				Anyone else find it funny how the &quot;drug abusers&quot; can spell properly and the &quot;clean christian&quot; can&#039;t? Or how he supposedly used to &quot;snor&quot; Coke MDMA Smack Crack and Heroin? I&#039;d figure if he can get coke&amp;crack, he&#039;d snort the coke and smoke the crack...MDMA I just don&#039;t know but, also, smack and heroin...same drug.

Mormon Jesus hung out in America with the Jews and fucked bitches and had wives and all kinds of shit.

				Why is it whenever the God squad chooses to preach on here they don&#039;t bother spell checking, leave the caps-lock on, and ramble so incoherently they&#039;re obviously on more drugs than any of us heathens could ever hope to ingest in one sitting?

				I think Red Rama is right -- some idiot has wandered on in here high on narc.s or alcohol or just the smell of their own sh*t. Last time I checked, Jesus didn&#039;t use abusive language and neither did many churchgoers. (I&#039;ve been away btw. Someone from BMR told me a crackpot was on SR and posted your thread.) <br /><br />Stop wasting everybody&#039;s time here. You&#039;re not Jesus. You&#039;re not christian. You&#039;re not ANYbody. Don&#039;t come in here and spout off because you can&#039;t handle your own liquor. Or because you finally clocked Gears of War 3 and can&#039;t afford to buy your next computer game until Friday. And if you threaten us, you better hope to God we don&#039;t find where you live you juvenile little piece of sh*t because I&#039;m not the kind of animal who puts up with it. Go home.<br /><br />Piece out, drive safely, and don&#039;t forget to die. ;)

				I&#039;ve been smoking since I was 16 and I&#039;m 22 now. I used to do it a few times a week, mainly weekends. The last two years though I&#039;ve been a daily smoker, and it&#039;s not unheard of for me to clear 4-6 bowls of top shelf a day when I have enough. Aside from detoxing for a new job and an occasional break that was always not my choice I&#039;ve never bothered &quot;quitting&quot;. My longest break from it was maybe 3-4 months. I honestly don&#039;t see much noticeable damage to my short-term memory. I&#039;ll gladly take the short-term memory difficulties if there are any, considering how many other areas of the brain/cognitive function benefit from it.

				Really! we are discussing brain damage and weed now...common guys...there have already been new studies that prove there is no brain damage caused nor any long term affects when you smoke weed other than possible lung complications.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sure when you smoke a fatty and your all stoned... your not gonna remember shit...if you smoke a fatty before school or something important, your gonna zone the fuck out and not pay attention to shit.<br /><br />Be responsible about smoking weed and you&#039;ll be just fine...<br /><br />But fuck that, i stay high alllllllll day mothafuckas!

				LOL i see some of my favorite SRforum regulars on this bitch already!!!!<br /><br />Dude Shut the FUCK up. Save your own soul and don&#039;t fucking worry about mine! I turned away a fuckin bible banger from my doorstep in the rain this morning. I stopped caring when I talked to some Christians who informed me that ALL who have not chosen Christianity go straight to hell. I know some Jews who are extraordinary people (for example). I wont follow a religion that condemns people for not believing every word of a book that was written 2000 years ago and mis-translated about 2000 different times. A book which contradicts it&#039;s own damn self for that matter. You fucking Christians have been the root of pretty much ALL wars so get the fuck out of my face and burn in hell!
