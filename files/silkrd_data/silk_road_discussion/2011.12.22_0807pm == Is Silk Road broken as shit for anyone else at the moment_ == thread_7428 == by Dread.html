				Because on my end my messages, orders, account balance, etc are all refusing to update. I&#039;ll read a message and when I go to my inbox it still says it&#039;s unread and when I get new ones I won&#039;t see them in my inbox until I exit my browser and reopen it. It&#039;s basically that way for everything else as well.<br /><br />

				Weird, it&#039;s working great for me, has been for a couple of weeks. <br /><br />For whatever reason, the TOR node I&#039;ve been on for the past week, SR and the forum are almost as fast as browsing the clearnet.<br /><br />I was just able to send a message, finalize an order, and browse the store with no problems.

				That&#039;s odd. I&#039;ve sent and received messages just fine and my balance updated just an hour or so ago when I deposited some bitcoins. Consider messaging SR Support (link is at the bottom right on the main website).

				There was a recent update to tor, again.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t updated in the last couple of weeks, and SR just updated today, that could very well be the problem.<br /><br />Your tor version you are using now should end in .35

				I couldn&#039;t get on for hours before when no one else had a problem. It&#039;s weird. I tried using a new identity, restarting the browser and even restarting the computer. Then I updated to the latest tor version and it worked fine. <br /><br />After updating to the newest tor I can&#039;t see the btc value anymore and there are a few graphical glitches like the minimize, maximize, and exit buttons are all black.<br /><br />Lots of glitches. It&#039;s part of the charm of SR. ::)

				I have problems logging on to SR maybe 50% of the time I try. Its something I expect now. Try shutting down and restarting tor or just refresh. Eventually the issue will work itself out.
