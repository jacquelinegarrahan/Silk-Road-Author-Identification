				There&#039;s a new vendor that just popped up that has a great deal that I&#039;d like. However, he has literally 0 reviews. What&#039;s weird is that the account is 7 months old.<br /><br />He&#039;s not requiring FE, so it doesn&#039;t look like he&#039;s scamming. LE maybe? He has a very limited quantity of the item I want (at an absurdly low price btw) so I don&#039;t want him to sell out.<br /><br />Should I just go for it? If it is LE, what could happen? There&#039;s still no proof that I&#039;m the one who actually ordered it, so why would LE do this anyway?

				Odd, he doesn&#039;t require FE so if a good deal was avaliable I&#039;d take it.<br />He also seems to have some knowledge according to his listing details.<br />

				Yeah well definitely won&#039;t FE. He only requires it for people with &lt;10 transactions so I&#039;m good. If he has something priced **absurdly** low, should I not order it?

Its possible he`s a scammer, but its also possible he`s legit. Hard to say why he`s still around after a long time with no sales though.
