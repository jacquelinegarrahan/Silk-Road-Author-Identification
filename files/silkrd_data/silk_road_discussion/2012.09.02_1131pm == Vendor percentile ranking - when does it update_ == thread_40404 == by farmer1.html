				I have been a vendor here for only 21 days and 30 completed transactions. When does my percentile ranking change/update? What factors make up a ranking and what weight does each carry?

				I would also like to know this answer.&nbsp; A guess would be once a certain number of sales is accomplished.

				It only ever updates when SR gets back from the beach having chased all the hot gals he can handle and comes <br />down from the single malt scotch hangover. Two aspirin and a vitamin c and he finally will<br />get to it after he does all the other shit that comes first!!!&nbsp; :P

				Take it for all you can!&nbsp; Don&#039;t try to make a big deal about it because it puts you up ahead of all the vendors that worked their butts off to get to the top %, &amp; you get first billing for just starting out!&nbsp; Just check out seller rank under cannabis, domestic, &amp; don&#039;t complain!<br /><br /><br />NCK

				Pirate Roberts has explained this. You have to search for yourself.<br />A deal gone bad will set you back a few % even though you would have 300 or more flawless transactions.<br />Because the last deals count for more %<br />If you have 300 transactions and every transaction would count for the same percentage, you would have to have more then 9 transactions that went bad to come at a rate of 99% or a less percentage.<br /><br />You will find it in combination with the right words.<br />Otherwise you have to check all the messages from the pirate.<br />A little over 400 posts.

				The issue is currently with the new updated site, all the new vendors with what looks to be less than a month under their belt, get listed at 0%, which puts them on the top of the first page for best sellers, it doesn&#039;t start them at the 100% and start to work the % down at least in the first month or so apparently.&nbsp; It&#039;s a glitch that DPR knows about,&nbsp; &amp; is on the long list to correct.&nbsp; But it is a bit misleading when the first 6 - 10 vendors listed are actually in the lowest percentile, &amp; once you get past them all of the sudden you have the highest rated vendors . . .<br /><br /><br />NCK
