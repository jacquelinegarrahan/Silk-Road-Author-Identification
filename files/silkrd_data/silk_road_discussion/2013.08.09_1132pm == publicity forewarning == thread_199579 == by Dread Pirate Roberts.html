				I have insider information that it is an article that will be published by FOX, and will look favorably upon SR by one of their more libertarian writers. It will probably bring a whole lot of new people to the SR. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m allowed to post about it publicly, so PM me for more details.&nbsp;

				Is this going to be another article that says Silk Road is the &quot;eBay for criminals&quot; like every other SR article ever, or is it going to be more informative?<br /><br />On another note, does anybody ever wonder what DPR will do once this site gets really big? I mean, there&#039;s really only two foreseeable options for the future of SR. LE busts it, or DPR takes it down. As SR gets more and more popular, it seems like an LE bust would become more and more likely. Is there a point where DPR would decide enough is enough and take down the site, or are we in it till the end?

				DPR, would you like to see this site just become the one and only black market, and have every world government bow down and put a real end to the War on Drugs?&nbsp; Think about how the world would be if all of this was legal, and widely accepted.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Also, is this &#039;new information&#039; about yourself stuff WE know?&nbsp; OR is this like, semi-sketchy info?&nbsp; What&#039;s up?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They&#039;re not going to tell us that you&#039;re a honey-pot, now, are they? lmao

				Hopefully we have a contingency in case it ends up being bad news...<br /><br />If this does bring more users to the road, DPR&#039;s % will increase and that money can be used to furthur improve SR and make it harder for LE.<br /><br />The more users on TOR the harder to track...<br /><br />DPR, i put my faith in you.<br />

				If DPR is involved in this I guess the only positive thing that can come of it really is trying to give some ideology and context to the website, presenting it as how we see it and why we think it is morally correct to use the website regardless of legality, hopefully that should plant a seed in the minds of the public, rather than a bias, skewed representation by the mainstream media about a website full of immoral criminals.&nbsp; Giving our side of the story so to speak.&nbsp; Or maybe I&#039;m being too optimistic.

Depends on the media outlet &amp; country somewhat. But seems pretty unlikely. It&#039;s the attention grabbing headline that will sell, and the subtle ideology and intentions are likely to end up towards the end of the piece, if they make it in. Be prepared that forum quotes could end up in print if they haven&#039;t already - there&#039;s a good chance of that, forums will always make easy pickings for lazy journos! <br /><br />In some respects, the more the general public are reminded that recreational drug use is not going away, the closer we get to a rethink of the whole sorry system.

				So 5 pages of this speculation circle-jerk, and over 24 hours later, and not one follow up response from the OP. You know DPR? (or as top44 rightfully Freudian slipped &quot;DRP&quot; ...lol!<br /><br />Seriously though. Why throw us this &#039;bone&#039; of info, only to leave us alone afterwards to fight over it with conjecture and speculation?<br /><br />I saw the random threads, peppered throughout the forum in the past few weeks speculating that there had been a change in the writing styles of DPR, leading to the educated guess that - Yes, it does seem plausible, as that is the whole idea behind the moniker. I didn&#039;t read &#039;The Book&#039; but I know the gist of it, and it only makes sense that the DPR handle is used by a multitude of business/techno-savvy individuals high up on the Silk Road chain of command. <br /><br />If anyone want&#039;s to get into some REAL conspiracy theories about this, try my latest paranoid delusion. <br /><br />OK, so Freedom Hosting gets hit, all in the name of kiddie-porn, or &#039;CP&#039; as is the &#039;PC&#039; term.&nbsp; That in turn takes out Tormail, which up until that day, was lauded as the be all end all of secure email. by even the nerdiest techies of shit I don&#039;t understand, but am grateful to the men and women who are technerds. <br /><br />Now, this next question begs an answer. How would the elimination of Tormail help Silk Road? Not help the buyers and vendors, but the real profiteers of Silk Road. The OWNERS. The one(s) you affectionately imagine to be DPR, some sort of elusive superhero- archetype?<br /><br />One big benefit I see, is helping to wipe out &quot;out of escrow transactions&#039; or more to the point &quot;out of Silk Road&quot; transactions. <br /><br />And if you think that shit wasn&#039;t happening, or it was such a small percentage, then you probably also think DPR is this one man, all done up in Capt. Jack Sparrow garb. <br /><br />Anyone notice a lot of vendors getting banned for &#039;out of escrow&#039; activity? Very few, if any actually getting their account back, like Frank Matthews. I think he was such a good &#039;earner&#039; that they let him come back. <br /><br />Now this is just a theory children. I can&#039;t prove any of it. It&#039;s a hell of a lot more interesting than &quot;There&#039;s a different person writing under the DPR screenname&quot;&nbsp; - which even to an amateur like me, was obvious a long time ago. <br /><br />Now, we can put a double layer of tinfoil on our heads, (funny, I can only find aluminum), and take this a step further. <br />Remember the speculation that LE already took over SR a while back? Perhaps right after that last outtage? Once again, I&#039;m not computer savvy, but wouldn&#039;t having the site down for 4 or 5 days be the best way to comb through the data of all the sales and PM&#039;s ?<br /><br />Then forums goes down in the same fashion? Another &#039;cull the archives for illegal activity shakedown&#039;?????<br /><br />Just some paranoid thoughts since the person in lieu of DPR, seems to be teasing us with small tidbits of clues. Reminds me of The Riddler from Batman. <br /><br />Now if you techno-IT-computer people are going to jump on me here, please dumb it down to laymans terms if you don&#039;t mind. I am interested to learn, but some of you don&#039;t realize you&#039;re talking calculus to an 11th grade Algebra/Trig dropout. (Thanks in advance) ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;8)&nbsp; Chip&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br /><br />PS. And stop saying &quot;The Man who runs this site&quot;! - How do you know it&#039;s not a woman? - Sexist pigs! ::)<br />Also, who the fuck does Blue Giraffe play into this? - It sounds like that name is connected to the CP shit, but I also recall some spaced out LSD vendor using that name. - I&#039;d research it all out, but frankly I&#039;m sick of it already, and the last thing I want to hear about/think about is CP and the scumbags who are involved in it.&nbsp; IMHO public hangings are in order for the likes of them.

				I believe DPR is giving us a heads up because something very similar to this happened about a year or so ago i believe.&nbsp; a whole bunch of SR related articles started popping up on the clearnet and the silk road got REALLY REALLY busy.&nbsp; Busy enough it crashed the SR servers and SR was down for a very long time.&nbsp; Also during this time you always get wild and crazy debates over is new customers a good idea?&nbsp; are they all cops!? (and then the tin foil is broken out)&nbsp; i&#039;d also like to mention last time this exact thing happened the BTC price skyrocketed from $12 US a BTC to $100 US a BTC.&nbsp; I think DPR is trying to give those of us that were here and remember what happened the chance to get our affairs in order with our favorite vendors to make sure we can still contact them in case of another site crash, and to buy some BTC while they are at the price they are now so if there is another skyrocket in BTC price we can all make a little money.&nbsp; Get your affairs in order, prepare for a server crash, buy some BTC, get some popcorn, sit back and get ready to watch the crazies.&nbsp; (BTW us old-timers who don&#039;t mind helping noobs and answering the same noob questions 8 times in the same day, Get ready to be really busy)

				There have been many reports and articles published about SR. SR isn&#039;t exactly a secret. Tons of people know about it. This thread is full of paranoia. If you don&#039;t like the way dpr is running the show, you are free to use atlantis or bmr or private boards. I joined SR almost 2 years ago and dpr has never done us wrong. There was a ton of publicity and an influx of new members after the gawker articles and SR survived just fine. I trust dpr&#039;s judgement. Obviously he is making money but he really believes in what he&#039;s doing. He hasn&#039;t been as active on the forums as he used to be but he is still here. Just relax and enjoy the show.

				Apparently some people are a little confused. The Dread Pirate Roberts is a character in a book who&#039;s identity gets passed on from person to person, each new one taking the place of the old one so as the former may retire while their legacy is continued in the form of a new captain who will rule the seas. This book was adapted into a movie, which is known by many names but is commonly called &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

				I don&#039;t think SR was ever intended to be secret. We know about it don&#039;t we? Remember DPR&#039;s earlier posts - this is an experiment in liberty. It&#039;s not just a cute way to get drugs. It&#039;s 2 years since even US congressmen called for SR to be shut down, and SR has resisted it all. DPR, whoever he/she/they are, are far too smart to willingly compromise their business. I have confidence. If it is time to move forward into mainstream visibility, so be it.<br /><br />Take care.

A man gets hypnotized and has to periodically and impulsively buy a specific book every time he sees it on display.

It&#039;s a shitty book that he compulsively buys, that&#039;s how they know it&#039;s almost always him at that specific bookstore when the purchase goes down. When the time comes, his government handlers read him a phrase from the book, and he goes into kill mode, causing him to assassinate his target.<br /><br />This is the strategy DPR is using.

				FUCK.<br /><br />Might be about time to quit while I&#039;m ahead.<br /><br />I dont think dpr is to blame for this really though.... maybe fox was already doing an article, and they decided to message dpr to get some info for the story....<br /><br />Either way shit is getting real and I dont think I am going to want to stick around much longer.....

				Guess the article. &quot; At the time of writing, Silk Road remains open for business, as for the Dread Pirate Roberts, he recently posted a message to his customers. &quot; I&#039;ve never had so much fun, I know we&#039;ve been at it for a year now, but really, we are just getting started&quot; He signed of with a yellow smiley face, grinning ear to ear!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Class that is.

				the way i like to think about it... sr servers are set up in a barn in the middle of but fuck no where and no one knows. whoever dpr is at the time can do whatever they want because they are the captain. if he/she wants to do an interview and thinks he/she covers there ass enough which im sure they would...... no doubt. then who cares. other then if people are scared LE will take over, *doubt it * then its all good. who cares if more people know about it. the more people using it, the harder it is to stop.

				I do not see why this is necessary at all. I believe SR has more then enough business as it is, I don&#039;t know how much more it could take to be honest. It makes me feel like DPR has a bigger plan. I&#039;m not sure what though. A drug revolution? Hopefully something with good intentions. I just don&#039;t think now is the right time.<br /><br />To me SR is more then a marketplace, it is a community.

				The ideas regarding the current DPR have nothing to do with the lore or the book or movie or whatever.<br /><br />It has to do with the fact that there&#039;s been significant changes. And it has to do with how things were run before. There definitely seemed to be a different air/heir. There&#039;s a number of points I could point out that holla at a change of ownership. But that&#039;s when you revert to the lore. Either it&#039;s completely changed, that the news story will show that, or whoever they think it is..... he/she/fish.... there could have just as easily been a change of FORUM ADMINISTRATION for the profile listed as DPR. All you have to do is have someone else write for you and the place goes bonkers. <br /><br />Point is, is SR is still here. Let&#039;s put our faith in our fearless leaders who really get shit done. DPR, original or not, we still have you here. And we are all better off that you are here. <br /><br />To everyone who makes this place a new frontier, and all those that pioneer, my hat to you.

				Read the article and was happy until I got here&gt; “We’ve won the State’s War on Drugs because of Bitcoin,” he writes.<br /><br />FACE PALM! Thanks DPR...

The banks and govt already hate it and want it gone, you&#039;ve given them a golden quote to help do it. In the future I would ask the community to help protect bitcoin as its just as important as SR if not more so because eventually drug laws will change but MONEY? <br /><br />Theres a fight on and many fronts, the drug war is important to challenge and destroy and I THANK YOU for doing some very heavy lifting DPR but the policy of being low key was a good one.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather the buffoons in gov not be given cliff notes on how we&#039;re going to fuck them.

				Everyone should go forward with the idea in mind that the site is in the hands of LE, and always should have&nbsp; been doing buisness this way.<br /><br />We do now know and will not know until it is to late who is actually running the site, all precautions should be taken.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter if the site is run by LE and I don&#039;t really give a fuck, it does not make a difference if you make sure you are making no info of yourself available to the admins who can read PM&#039;s and so on.<br /><br />Cheers.
