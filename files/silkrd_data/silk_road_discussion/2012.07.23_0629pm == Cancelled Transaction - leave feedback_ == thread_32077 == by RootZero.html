				I had a vendor cancel an order a while ago due to various issues. I notice it gives me the opportunity to leave feedback for this.<br /><br />What should I do in this situation? Is there a way not to leave feedback?

				Just be honest with your feedback on how the transaction went (even though it was cancelled). Express your concerns about the various issues, if they were the vendors fault. <br /><br />If the vendor has issues than other potential customers have a right to know. If the issues were on your end, and the vendor worked with you to cancel the order then give them positive feedback and say they&#039;re doing things right.

				Yeah, good advice. Was for a tiny test order that never arrived, I expect the issue was at his end for various reasons, not worth going into.<br />Just left a quick note and a 5/5, he seems a good bloke and the more I thought about it the more generous I realised he&#039;d been.<br /><br />Just find it a bit odd the SR system does this more than anything. ???

				Not odd at all. Even if the order is canceled it gives the customer a valuable opportunity to give feedback on the process. Like if the vendor was a douchebag of if they were great.
