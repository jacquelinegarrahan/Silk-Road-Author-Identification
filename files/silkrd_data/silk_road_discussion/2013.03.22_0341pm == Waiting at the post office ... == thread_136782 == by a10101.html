				I&#039;m waiting in line at the post office because I was supposed to receive a package yesterday, and it didn&#039;t come. It was guaranteed delivery by 3PM. The USPS website says that the package was undeliverable, but it listed the wrong zip. It looks like they&#039;re gonna try again, hopefully with the right zip this time. I called several times, but I can&#039;t get a clear story about where the package is, although they seem to know which PO it&#039;s supposed to be at. The local post office doesn&#039;t answer the phone, so I have to go in.<br /><br />I figure there are 3 possibilities. 1. The vendor put the wrong info. I know my info was right. I have the same text file that I use for each order, so I can&#039;t have messed that up. 2. The PO screwed up and put it on the wrong truck. This seems the most likely. 3. It&#039;s a sting. They want me to come in and claim it and slap the cuffs on me.<br /><br />If it&#039;s 3, I&#039;m screwed. But they have my name and address, so how much worse can I make it by showing up? If the address is wrong, it will get returned to a bogus address, no doubt, and I can&#039;t have that happen. I have to go get the package. My mailman doesn&#039;t come until 4PM every day, so I can&#039;t wait until then to know. It would kill me to wait that long.<br /><br />The people at the PO are really helpful. I give them the DCN and they send me to a manager. The manager tells me to wait for a few minutes and goes to the back. This is where I start to think about the possibilities. Did the vendor pack it up in a rush and leave some trace? Did the package tear and the drugs can be seen now? I look around for the cops, expecting them to come in at any moment to drag me away. Well, it&#039;s too late now. I just have to wait to see what happens. A full 5 minutes pass. A very long 5 minutes.<br /><br />And then I see it. Thank god. It&#039;s a beautiful, fully sealed package. I know I&#039;m in the clear now. I have to sign for it, but I&#039;ve come this far and I&#039;m not backing down now.<br /><br />In the end, it&#039;s all good. Thank the SR gods.

				Yeah it&#039;s like the first rule of Fight Club thing...<br /><br />To sustain plausible deniability never tell the post office you were expecting a package.<br /><br />99% of the time it&#039;s not an issue and they need a hand to get the package on track to you or just needed a few more days to sort things out... but the 1% of the time sure does suck a lot of ass and going to get the package that they marked as illicit can be the difference between kissing your girlfriend good night and getting a tattoo that reads &quot;Rocco&#039;s Bitch&quot; on your ass.<br /><br />Next time only order amounts you are willing to loose and do your best to not have any involvement with the DCN except maybe checking it through third party sites over TOR a good while after it was supposed to arrive.

				I have to say a10101 has more balls then I do. Jesus that was a hell of a risk especially with all the warning signs that most of the time indicate a sting. I don&#039;t suggest anyone else do what he did. Anyway I&#039;m glad your ok and it worked out. I&#039;d hate to see you get locked up so reconsider if something like this happens again.&nbsp; :)

				I wouldn&#039;t take the chance either. It&#039;s only money, easy come easy go. Then I think about the last time I was in a PO and some guy in front of me had this sketchy brown flimsy box with a terrible tape job and handwritten &quot;Live fish&quot; on all sides sitting on the counter. The guy behind the counter didn&#039;t even blink an eye and slapped some postage on it, then into the sack. <br /><br />So many packages go through.....

				This reminds me of some show on national geographic or discovery or something, they have people getting caught with drugs in the post office all the time exact same story as yours except they are in jail now and you are at home with a big smile on your face im guessing... glad your still with us on the road man.

				I aint gonna lie one day I was expecting something and I didnt get it yet it was out for delivery. Turns out she forgot to put it in, so I drove up to the post office and inquired ahah, thats why i asked about the ID. It turns out they called the mail lady and she had already went back and put it in the box . I think going to the mailbox and post office would equal the same, unless of course their holding it there for the police to intercept and sting. With all the shit that I realize is going thru the mail now tho it just seems like theres not alot of attention focused on busting people , unless of course it spills out in transit or just wreaks

				I might look like I&#039;ve been around awhile but I&#039;ve only been actively around on the forums since right around new years, been a user on SR since June 2012, I know of a farmers market bust but nothing too specific on Breck CO, elaborate if you can or link me.

				I had a similar situation.....and I&#039;ll admit I was scared shitless going to the PO - esp. cuz of benzo WD - but when the PO manager seemed helpful, and said he found it and to come pick it up, I did.&nbsp; and he threw the package out from the back w/o even looking at my face<br /><br />Riskier than I&#039;d like - but I figure if I had a legit package with the same problem - I&#039;d be calling the PO tracking it down.&nbsp; And if I did nothing - and didnt get it - there&#039;s a package floating around out there that may get returned to sender and opened....which neither seller or buyer want.
