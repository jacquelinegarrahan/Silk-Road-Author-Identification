				Hello, I have been here for about 3 weeks and got my first order last monday, which was 2g of weed and when I opened that letter, I was blown away. The quality of the weed was so good and the smell was heavenly. It was fluffy and the weight was 2g&#039;s as I ordered it. It didn&#039;t even took long to come, about 3 days and it was so easy I&#039;m still blown away. It was pretty cheap too about 10e/g. Here where I live weed is 20e/g, even if its shitty weed. Only thing you can get here cheap is some shitty hash and even that is gonna cost you at least like 13e/g, so getting weed this good, at this price is a life saver. I don&#039;t need lot of weed to get high, so far I have smoked about 0.3 grams and that&#039;s from 3 nights, so I can make this weed last about a month or so. I freaking love this place and I&#039;m still little shocked about the fact that it&#039;s real. I just wanted to say I appreciate every vendor,admin and moderator here, I can&#039;t even imagine the work and dedication needed to sell and ship goods here without getting caught, so thank you for doing this. I love this site and I love everyone here, thank you for making this happen, getting weed is never been easier.<br /><br />PS: Vendor I got the awesome weed from was Freewheelinf.

				Which vendor was it? If you are happy with their service and product, dont forget to mention their name so others can know as well. The only thing you shouldnt do is give any clear details revealing the location or shipping methods for security reasons.<br /><br />Glad you are pleased by your first transaction. Welcome to the Road<br /><br />I definitely suggest you try out LexiSadie, shes got some of the most delicious and potent nugs EVER :)

Oh yes, you are right, of course I should tell the name of the vendor, so people know he&#039;s awesome and build him rep as a thank you for excellent services, how rude of me. Vendor was Freewheelinf and his nug is awesome and arrived quickly. Of course I wouldn&#039;t risk revealing my location or shipping methods because, I understand that you have to be careful with these things so, you nor the vendor get in trouble, because that&#039;s the beauty of this thing, being totally anonymous 8). I tried to find this LexiSadie, but couldn&#039;t find her from marketplace, but I did found her from forums so, should I contact her or what? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14075.msg138542#msg138542">Quote from: verbalkint on March 05, 2012, 07:12 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14075.msg136926#msg136926">Quote from: Riku on March 04, 2012, 01:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I freaking love this place<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s awesome! congrats on your first order.&nbsp; We need more pot smoking emoticons imo&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks and this forum could definitely use some emoticons with joints in their mouth, make it happen admin&#039;s. ;D <br /><br />Update: I saw that she hasn&#039;t been active for a while, thanks anyways tough. =)

				Riku I think we live in different locations which is why lexi&#039;s listings dont show up for you, she only ships domestically. <br /><br />I have never heard of the vendor you used for example.

Freewheelinf ships to EU, CH and NO so, I guess you don&#039;t live in any of these place&#039;s and that&#039;s why you can&#039;t see his listings?
