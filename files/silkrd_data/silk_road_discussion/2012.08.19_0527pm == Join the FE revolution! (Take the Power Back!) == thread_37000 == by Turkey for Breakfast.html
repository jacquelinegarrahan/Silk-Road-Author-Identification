				I was thinking that a vendor who requires FE should never be entitled to feedback of 5/5 losing a point for the requirement. In my assertion 5/5 = perfect and a FE requirement is less than perfect. I personally will not deal with a vendor who requires FE as it opens me up to more risk than I am willing to take. But if those who do would begin offering only a max of 4/5 feedback to those vendors the community would be encouraged to not require FE on the seller side and the buyer side could more easily identify those vendors simply by their rating.<br /><br />Anyone disagree?

				I think if a vendor deserves a 5/5, I&#039;ll give him a 5/5. Some people don&#039;t mind finalizing early, so obviously people will disagree with this, it&#039;s all personal preference. Do whatever you want, and let other people do whatever they want. If I&#039;m required to FE but the product gets here fast with great shipping, is just as good or better than advertised, the seller had good communication, and no other issues were present, I&#039;m giving a 5/5. Don&#039;t want to FE? Don&#039;t buy from vendors who require it. Want to give a 4/5 for someone who requires that you FE? I don&#039;t really care, go for it if that&#039;s what will make you happy. Personally I wouldn&#039;t give a 4/5 if I knew beforehand that they required FE. Respect the vendor&#039;s rules or find another one.

				Im thinking the rating system is set up to provide vendors evidence of the quality of there service, you cant predict this until you have the product in hand, FE is normally advertised on there profile so you know this is going to happen before you place the order. You know what your getting into before you buy, your not misled, thinking its something its not or poor service, iv finalized a few times for respected vendors but rated them on there service and product.<br /><br />&nbsp;

This is like if you purchased something advertised as &#039;shitty weed that I&#039;m selling off cheap&#039; and then giving the vendor a low rating because you did in fact receive shitty weed.

				I can see where the OP is coming from. Vendors who FE just to FE are dangerous, especially to newer buyers. That said, if I see a vendor that wants me to FE and I don&#039;t want to FE then I don&#039;t buy. If I couldn&#039;t find another vendor then I&#039;d just suck it up or maybe try to talk to the vendor. <br /><br />Someone mentioned Ivory and Ivory is a great example. I placed an order and Ivory was my first FE ever. I know Ivory has great product and an impeccable reputation and has a business to run. For someone like that, they need that money today, not in a week or two when the product comes through.<br /><br />There&#039;s plenty of vendors out there and the ones who aren&#039;t good will eventually get outed and run out of business. The ones who are legit and treat their customers well will prosper and make money--regardless of FE policy.<br /><br />Long story short: FE provides nice protection for the buyer but sometimes the seller needs the coverage more. <br /><br />Cheers

				I get the thing about not wanting to FE for safety. If it&#039;s a big order, I get not wanting to FE. If it&#039;s an international order and it&#039;s a large order, you&#039;re taking your money into your own hands as is in risking seizures and such. If you&#039;re ordering small internationally, how does it really detract from the product/service by FE&#039;ing? <br /><br />I don&#039;t FE unless I trust the vendor (and that&#039;s the rare exception not the rule thus far). It&#039;s not like you have access to that money after you place the order anyways so if you&#039;re buying from a reputable vendor (which you should in this situation) then why not FE? <br /><br />Maybe you&#039;ve been burned and I get that. But this is a fucking black market enterprise and the dealers need their funds. If they need more product they already have to go through the hoops of getting their BTC back into cash (going through any laundering they may need), buy/acquire/make more product, then continue the process of selling. I doubt we&#039;d have as many good international vendors willing to send out if they needed to wait a matter of weeks before making their profit off one order. <br /><br />Not to mention all the lazy fuckers who don&#039;t finalize in a timely manner even after they get their product. I mean, damn. <br /><br />Not all of this is directed at OP as I definitely get that we buyers want assurance that we&#039;re not getting fucked but let&#039;s not get so entitled that we start making vendor&#039;s lives more difficult--the good ones already work hard to service this community and they deserve every 5/5, FE be damned<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />.

				If you choose to agree to buy from someone who requires you to FE then that is what you should expect to happen. If you FE, get your product, and then leave a 4/5 because the vendor did what they said they would then you are not being honest when leaving feedback.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t your choice to decided if FE is wrong or not. You can use it or not but you don&#039;t get to decide if others get to use it or not.<br /><br />I don&#039;t require anyone to FE, but I wouldn&#039;t pass judgement on anyone who did. Maybe they have their reasons. It is a useful tool in certain situations (as others have described above). Where a buyer chooses to spend their money is their real power and the best means they have of changing a marketplace.

In the end the vendor is working for money. When a vendor requires FE the transaction is inherently imperfect. 5/5 implies a perfect transaction. The vendor gets paid for his services, he does not automatically deserve perfect feedback when he is offering an imperfect service. I am struggling to understand why so many people disagree with very obvious logic.&nbsp;

				Your version of &#039;perfect service&#039; doesn&#039;t include the buyer getting exactly what they were supposed to get from a seller (according to the terms of their agreement). Your gripe is with the system, not the vendor. They are just using the tools which have been made available to them at the best of their abilities.<br /><br />I do not require FE - just to be clear.<br /><br />&quot;Always use the escrow system! This can&#039;t be stressed enough. 99% of scams are from people who set up fake vendor accounts and ask buyers to pay them directly or release payment before their order arrives. This behavior should be reported immediately. If you do choose to do this, we will be completely unable to help you in the event of fraud.&quot;

Luckily i didn&#039;t buy anything from him but it was tempting. You have a great idea with the 4/5 but i don&#039;t think enough members will participate for it to work sadly. The rating system is greatly flawed i see buyers leaving 5/5 for items advertised as LSD but weren&#039;t. They complain yet leave a 5/5 still wtf?

				To put it simply, any buyer who Finalizes Early for whatever the reason is absolutely crazy. There are many vendors who don&#039;t require buyers to Finalize Early. I understand vendors having buyers with less than say ten transactions or bad stats to Finalize early, but for buyers with good stats, vendors IMO, should use the SR Escrow system.I believe a vendor needs to factor in the potential delay in receiving BTC due to reasons such as international deliveries, when starting up a business which I&#039;m sure is easier said than done. Equally, I implore all buyers to finalize any orders they receive immediately so vendors don&#039;t have to wait unnecessarily for their coin. It&#039;s about having a level of decency and respect for each other and follow the philosophy that &quot;treat others as they treat you&quot;. For me, if a vendor processes my order in a timely manner and keeps me informed then I will 100% finalize the order within an hour of receiving it, guaranteed. Even if there is a problem with the order, as long as we can reach a solution I will still Finalize the order for them so they can keep their business turning over. That&#039;s only fair to the vendor and IMO, will prosper a vendor/buyer relationship for future transactions which is good for everyone. :)

				I am not a big fan on FE. I think that Silk Road needs to add a feature that would allow you to Finalize Early but take away the ability for the customer to score the vendor on it. Once the customer click it It would start the regular timer that silk road has but it gives the vendor a 0/5 until you go back to review after you receive the product. If the timer counts down without you going into resolution or revising the feedback default feedback score will be given and it will count against the customers stats like an auto finalization. If a vendor requires FE they have to keep 33% of their current transactions in their account to settle any disputes. <br /><br />This would resolve the problem we have when we go to a vendors page and only see FE, or vendor with 100+ transactions and 100% score with no quality feedback and requiring customers to FE. Every time a customer has to FE it will hit their score until the customer revises their feedback. This will also encourage the customer to revise feedback after receiving the product. Keeping the 33% of transactions will help keep the vendor honest and at least allow for something back if the vendor stars scamming.

We have a functional escrow system and a 4 point feedback review system (and feedback notes) (I say 4 because 1/5 is essentially 0 because you cannot give 0.) Surely there is some way to alter the entire system and solve this problem, but until that happens I think anyone who takes the time and thinks about an FE requirement as a problem and thus an imperfect transaction will agree that it should never be given 5/5 feedback.

				The feedback system should be somewhat reworked imo somewhat like ebay it should be.<br />That way instead of FE lowering their rating it will go along with their total feedback.<br /><br />Positive- Neutral-Negative .... So that a 4/5 rating will not lower there rating<br /><br />Item as described&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Communication&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/5<br />Shipping time&nbsp; and packaging&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5/5<br /><br />Required FE... Yes or No<br /><br />This is much better because many sellers may earn a 4/5 rating for their packaging for example but you don&#039;t want to lower their 100% feedback.

It allows a vendor to send the product knowing the buyer has paid for the product in full. If there was no Escrow system, there would be fewer buyers, if any, willing to send an anonymous vendor BTC for a product they bought anonymously over the Hidden Web. Equally, I doubt there would be many vendors willing to send drugs to countries all over the world in the hope the anonymous person corresponding with them over the internet pays up. The potential risk would be massive for who ever sends to the other first, whether it was BTC or drugs. Escrow, IMO as a buyer, actually encourages a buyer to make a purchase with the knowledge we won&#039;t be ripped off. It encourages business, especially for people like me who without it, would stay away from sites such as SR Without Escrow, I personally would go without and look elsewhere for my fix. One thing is for sure though, I wouldn&#039;t purchase anything over the net without a safe guard such as Escrow in place.<br />I can totally understand where you are coming from as a vendor and actually sympathize with you regarding the way some buyers abuse the Escrow system. Unfortunately for newbie&#039;s, I believe some&nbsp; constraints such as not selling to people with less than 10 transactions or a certain amount of BTC spent may have to be implemented to minimize your risk (although I suspect they may already be used by you). It&#039;s these dickheads who screw it up for honest buyers such as myself who simply want some good shit delivered to my door and have no problem paying for the service or the privilege. I believe it&#039;s at the stage where registered post is a must so vendors actually know if a package does arrive. There seems to be a lot of he said/she said about packages arriving or not. At least if it can be proven to have arrived, SR Admin would look favorably at the vendor should it go to the Resolution Center for a decision to be made. There are both good and bad buyers and vendors here on SR and we as a community need to keep exposing them, weeding them out as best we can until someone thinks of a way we can eliminate them for good. Until then................

				If the buyer agrees to FE on their own accord and both parties are happy with that, then there is no reason a 5/5 can&#039;t be given if both parties are satisfied with the overall transaction. Where a vendor stipulates a buyer must FE for what ever reason, the buyer really has no reason for lowering his feedback score if&nbsp; he has entered into and agreed on the vendor&#039;s terms when making the order. If you stick to the rule of&nbsp; &quot;never FE for anyone, regardless of how good a deal may sound, you can&#039;t go wrong&quot;.There are plenty of vendors who are happy for you to use the Escrow system, just do some research. :)

				If you don&#039;t want to FE don&#039;t buy from that vendor...It&#039;s up to them what their policy is. A rating should be based on service, product and professionalism, not their requirements for doing business with a person.

				Your right NorCalKing, a buyer shouldn&#039;t give a vendor a 4/5 simply because the vendor asked the buyer to FE. It is a personal choice.

I can&#039;t see how a 1/5 feedback score can be given initially to the vendor when at that point, the transaction is in it&#039;s early stages. A vendor with 35+ transaction has a right to ask a buyer to FE so weather we like it or not, they are only operating within the rules set out by SR. My point is that a vendor with 35+ transactions has a right to ask a buyer to FE. Equally the buyer has a choice to either take the risk or politely refuse the request. If the buyer agrees to FE, for whatever reason and I&#039;m yet to find one, and the vendor has operated within the SR rules in asking the buyer to FE, then a 5/5 must be given provided the transaction was as expected. If they FE and it&#039;s a decision they have made, no one can complain.<br />

I&#039;m not going to give someone on here anymore respect then what I give to my local dealers which is close to none. this is a business not a fucking eharmony online making friends while buy drugs site.

Why would such an uneducated wanker like yourself, who probably has an ashtray on his motorbike, attempt to articulate these incoherent ramblings floating around in your head which make no sense at all and are best described as pointless dribble. You are the sort of person who would take an hour and a half to watch 60 Minutes!! Seriously, who are you trying to be champ? Your rude and hostile demeanor is fucking ridiculous and unwarranted. Your attitude stinks, especially towards vendors. It&#039;s really starting to piss me off, this wanna be gangsta talk used by some on this forum Show some respect, learn some manners and stop trying to be some &quot;tough hard ass&quot; dude your obviously not. It&#039;s this sort of bullshit, irrational behavior that has some of the more experienced forum members up in arms at how quickly some things here on SR have so quickly diminished.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The better question what the fuck is wrong with you trying to tell someone what to do on a open fucking forum. You&#039;re just another bitch ass nobody posting in a forum like myself. You don&#039;t like me fucking ignore me and stop whining like a 10 year old girl about it.<br />You probably been having discussion about me with your mom at the dinner table. 90% of you mother fuckers in here remind me of american government, just can&#039;t handle the fact you&#039;re not in control, get over it losers.

You? Pleeeeeeease! This is more like a case of your miniscule brain being stretched to capacity in a feeble attempt at securing some ammunition for your next post. I have no doubt that based on your previous posts, there are very few, if any bullets left in there!!!! Buy yourself a dictionary, go back to school and learn how to communicate with the human race.

				I couldn&#039;t give 2 fucks who you are, where your from or how tough you had it growing up!! There are others here on the forum who have grown up in similar circumstances that are polite and respectful of others, unlike yourself. I&#039;m not a nerd by any means, but I&#039;d certainly rather be a nerd than a cunt like you. If all you care about in life is drugs and are happy to label yourself a &quot;drug educated con&quot;then your living a sad existence. There are a lot of educated people on this forum who contribute loads of USEFUL information for all to use as they wish. Then there are incoherent jibberers like yourself who just talk shit about nothing. Look at some other member&#039;s posts, other than mine, after you have written yours and you&#039;ll see what I mean. After all you have written here and the replies you&#039;ve sent on other threads, I can say with some certainty that if you believe you &quot;have everything figured out perfectly&quot; in regards to your life, your fucking crazy and can&#039;t grasp the concept of reality. Not all drug users are junkies who don&#039;t give a fuck about anything. There are a lot of users who have full time careers working 40+ hrs a week and indulge in drugs as others do alcohol or cigarettes. If anyone wants an idea of the pointless dribble posted by spacecase #2, here is a classic example.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=37000.0;topicseen<br /><br />It&#039;s time for you to lay off the drugs mate cause obviously your having trouble distinguishing the difference between being straight (normal) and being high. Time for you to get some help.
