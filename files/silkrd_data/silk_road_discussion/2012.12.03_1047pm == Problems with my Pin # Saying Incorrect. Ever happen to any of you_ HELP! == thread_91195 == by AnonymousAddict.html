				This happens to me all the time. I have to usually enter my pin at least 3 times and I&#039;m close to 100% certain that I didn&#039;t add a typo or anything.<br /><br />

				This happened to me last night. I am now locked out of my account and unable to buy anything for 3 days.<br /><br />To change your PIN go to Account &gt; Settings.

				I&#039;ve had this happen before, was very frustrating, even more-so once I entered it 5 times and got locked out. <br /><br />Then I found out it&#039;s a regular occurrence, and you merely wait the allotted period of time, reply to a message they send you, and you get to reset your PIN. Although when it happened to me, it was 7 days, surprised to be hearing its 3 now.<br /><br />There are some people who even copy and paste their PIN and this happens to them though.
