				I was able to get on all morning and take care of orders, ship them out and read and respond to all my pms.&nbsp; Was on for about 4 hours, listed products and then went to drop off packages, came back and couldn&#039;t get on so I stopped trying for 4-6 hours.&nbsp; Just tried and wasn&#039;t able to the first 3 attempts but then the login page popped up and it&#039;s running faster than normal for me right now.<br /><br />Was able to read and respond to a bunch of pms without having to wait several minutes for each page to load so seems like too much traffic instead of another attack. (I sure hope so at least)<br /><br />I got several more orders during the hours I didn&#039;t try to connect so buyers were able to get on during the time I wasn&#039;t so I&#039;d say too much traffic for the servers is what is causing this.<br /><br />STM
