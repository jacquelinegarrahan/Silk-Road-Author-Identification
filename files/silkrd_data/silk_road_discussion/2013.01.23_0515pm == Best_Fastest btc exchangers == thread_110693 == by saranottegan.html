				I&#039;m trying to find someone to buy 3 bitcoins from.&nbsp; I usually go to Blue Sky Traders (deposit through Bank of America) and have the coins in an hour. They are closed this week and I really need the coins. I prefer bank deposit over moneygram and western union because i&#039;m not familiar with them. I might be able to handle WU though. <br /><br />The whole point is I need to 3 measly bitcoins soon so I can make my purchase. Anyone know of some good bitcoin vendors?

				The majority of vendors will have a minimum amount to exchange, such as Sugar Mama (who is awesome!). You can try PMing a few vendors and see if they would be willing to exchange a small amount. <br /><br />sdesu

You wont need any id for this process EVER, they dont card anyone for sending cash, only to collect $$$<br />After that you get an instruction form that shows you the account info, print the form<br />Go to walmart, cvs or wherever your moneygram is and grab a blue moneygram form<br />Fill out the form with the same alias name/address/date and account info on the form from Bitinstant (Payee will be Zipzap, inc) and amount of deposit<br />Go to counter and give them the moneygram slip &amp; money and you sign alias name on reciept.<br />In 5 mins when I&#039;m back to work I sign into my tormail and have an email waiting already from Bitinstant with confirmation # for the order execution on the BC network<br />Coins will be sent to the bitcoin address you provided.<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />Kola_nutz

				I&#039;m not plugging them on purpose, I just wanted to recommend that you keep an eye out for the vendor btcking.&nbsp; they were always an efficient reliable way to get btc.. especially in larger amounts. They have&#039;nt had any listings up for a few months, but I think they are returning in the next couple weeks if they&#039;re vendor page is any indication.

				Bitinstant bitinstant bitinstant bitinstant! Why anyone wouldent use them is beyond me.. only once have I had an issue... I did cash deposit at the store to email (coinapult) around 9pm on a Sunday night. I ended up having to wait till 8am the next morning before they were available. Do that shit at lunch time. After you pay you have coins within 5 minutes.

I have been using them for a while myself.. I just mentioned btcking mainly for transactions over 2000 bucks. They fore-go annoying daily caps.
