				Have anybody here ever bought drugs for low online and resold for higher online also? This is something i was thinking about doing but thought it wouldn&#039;t really work out. If you have done this how is it ? and what are the profits looking like?

				Many vendors would buy a pound of weed from my previous boss, BudCentral, and then just list it on their own vendor page for $1000 more. They had their own followings of buyers and so did we, so it wasn&#039;t like they were trying to compete with us with our own product.<br /><br />I&#039;m kind of pissed off that the other vendors could mark up our weed for that much and not even offer kickbacks, but on the other hand, good for them, if they can outsmart us and make a higher profit margin with fewer sales, GOOD FOR THEM.<br /><br /><br />You could buy ecstasy or M1 by the gram for 60 or 20 respectively, and break it down into doses and sell them for a higher mark up. I think thats what most people did.

				Yes you can, but you probably won&#039;t make a lot of money unless you think it through.<br /><br />Buying something online domestic and selling it domestic probably won&#039;t make a lot. Buying bulk from another country where its cheaper and selling it in smaller quantities domestic could make you quite a bit, but it does involve risk. Risk that the market you&#039;re operating on gets shutdown, risk that customs take your order and so on. You need to look at all the things you are able to buy cheaply then look at what there is a demand for where you are then go for the best options. Selling offline could be better depending on where you live and some other variables. This is really just common sense.<br /><br />Stay Safe.

The customs part is the part i&#039;m paranoid about, I was wondering how can a package get through customs anyway?&nbsp; Is there a certain way to package the stuff ? do customs look inside every package?

				Not personally, but it was clear vendors in NZ were buying things on SR bulk from overseas, splitting it and selling it at a high mark up.&nbsp; They&#039;d pay 50c per tab of nBome, resell for $20.&nbsp; MDMA at upwards of $50 per 0.1g, probably off the road too.&nbsp; Still sold quite a bit because people loved avoiding customs, and there never was a huge amount of vendors domestically.&nbsp; Similar situation in oz I think?&nbsp;
