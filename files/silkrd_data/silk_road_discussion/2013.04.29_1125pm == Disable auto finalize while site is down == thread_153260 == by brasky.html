				I have an order with MarijuanaIsMyMuse who from all accounts seems to have turned into a selective scammer recently. I dont want my order to auto finalize while I cant access to dispute it. Will my order auto finalize even if the site is down for the next few days?

Extensions kick in after the 17 day auto-finalise period has expired, so if you put it into resolution on day 10 requesting a 5 day extension and it is accepted, it will be another 12 days (the 7 day period that is left, plus the 5 day period requested) before an Administrator sees it again in the resolution center.<br /><br />Once an order is in the resolution center it will not auto-finalise. It is also considered bad etiquette to wait until the moment before auto-finalisation to request an extension as the vendor will be expecting their funds to be released to them on day 17, only for the order to be put into resolution at the last minute and an extension being requested.<br /><br />This will generally protect you for most site outages as they have rarely lasted longer than a day or two in the past. This case is a little different, and the site is expected to be down for at least a few more days, but employing the process above in future will give you peace of mind, if nothing else.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
