				Just curious, if you ordered from a vendor and verified a ship date and paid for express shipping, but the order wasn&#039;t shipped for 2 more days, would you expect the extra bitcoin spent as a refund or am I out of line?&nbsp; For example, placed an express order on Wednesday, order wasn&#039;t shipped till Friday (but vendor said it would be shipped Wednesday and in my mailbox Thursday), would you ask for your bitcoin back?

				If you specifically paid for upgraded Express shipping then yes.<br />If he simply offers Express and didnt send on time, thats a no IMO

				If a vendor specifically promised a shipping date to you personally and didn&#039;t live up to it they should proactively offer some sort of refund - but maybe that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t do anything about it, I see no harm in asking them.&nbsp; But be cool, just tell them you think what&#039;s fair.

				If it&#039;s someone you use regularly, maybe ask for a little extra product on next order, think I&#039;ve seen people do that around here -- I haven&#039;t personally, but if tactfully asked, would be worth a shot.<br /><br />DAN<br />

				This was with someone I hadn&#039;t used previously, and probably wouldn&#039;t use again in the future.&nbsp; One of the key things I judge a vendor on is how long it takes them to package and ship a product.&nbsp; I just wanted to make sure I wasn&#039;t out of line asking him for the difference between regular shipping and express shipping back since he sat on it for a few days.&nbsp; <br /><br />To Fred - it was a shipping service he offers already, but I had a discussion with him and verified with him which day it was to be shipped before placing the order, so I opted for the express option and verified this with him.&nbsp; When it didn&#039;t show up 2 days later I asked what was up and he said, oh, it just went out today, sorry.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be a whiny bitch, but it&#039;s more of the principal of the thing, not so much the dough.&nbsp; When I asked for a refund, he acted like I was being ridiculous.&nbsp; Either way, product received, that&#039;s half the battle right.&nbsp;

				If the vendor promised a specific day and didn&#039;t deliver I may ask for a partial refund.&nbsp; Express is a more expensive way to ship something period so some of the extra cost goes to that.&nbsp; I guess it kinda depends on how much extra you paid for the express shipping.
