				Hi there, i am seriously interested in setting up my own .onion site such as the<br />silkroad marketplace that works under tor.<br /><br />I am looking for a business partner that will look after the IT technical side while<br />i will run the site and do customer service etc.<br /><br />I am able to fund the site and am looking for a long term partner that has the<br />required technical expertise and that is very trustworthy. MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY<br />NEED TO KNOW HOW TO HIDE FROM THE AUTHORITIES AT EVERY STEP AND HOW TO CONCEAL AND<br />HIDE OR CASH OUT BITCOINS ETC AND MAKE THE SITE A LONG TERM AND PROFITABLE SITE.<br /><br />I have some knowledge on computing but require someone who has full<br />expertise on keeping the site completely hidden from law enforcement. They<br />should have knowledge on linux, encryption, keeping servers running 24/7 even if<br />attacked, and any other subject in running the site.<br /><br />Will you be able to help me?<br /><br />I do not just want to buy a simple onion url and cart and be left on my own to run it. <br /><br />I need someone that can implement many features that are needed that has the<br />best of the main onion marketplaces.<br /><br />Features such as =<br /><br />Custom design/ reliable shopping cart/ forum/ live chat/ nearly perfect<br />anonymity/ bitcoin washing/ New categories etc <br /><br />Can you give me an example of a onion marketplace you have setup? Or can you<br />show me the workings of a site you designed?<br /><br />Also please can you tell me what expertise you have in terms of<br />webdesign/programming/linux/encryption/onion/tor etc<br /><br /><br />Please also tell me more about the hosting that you aim to use? Is it freedom<br />hosting? I understand that silk road first started using freedom hosting but then<br />had issues with this, they then moved to their own<br />dedicated hidden servers.&nbsp; This is the sort of hosting expertise that i<br />am looking for.<br /><br />Please get back to me as to what exactly your service includes and what you can do<br />for me.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				This OP sounds like LE looking for information on how SR is being run... nice try but i don&#039;t think anyone who is smart enough to set up an anonymous darknet marketplace is dumb enough to give you a bunch of information&nbsp;

				I think Stray Cat intended to warn you about the risk that anyone contacting you regarding this &#039;ad&#039; could be from LE
