				DUE TO THE POTENTIONAL OF ME BANNHED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS SAID IN JEST AND IS IN NO WAY TRUE<br /><br />Hey wonder where protection of vendors fits in after one just finding out another has stored the address&nbsp; he used over 9 months back and messaged him outside of SR to show that he had this in a threatening manner<br /><br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t that be crazy right ?! I mean biascallly having no sort of ramifications of such a cosmic event (if 1 from 1 9 months ago is a saved, how many other vendors, how many other customers, would also be saved?<br /><br /><br />BUT YAY FOR SILK ROAD!

				I want to post my .02 cents. I am sure some people will Neg me but whatever.<br /><br />Honestly, this site is awesome, and I am very appreciative of this site being here to assist us, and yes I do agree that we should live free and be able to make choices on ourselves. If you want to do 40grams of heroin a day, or smoke 1 blunt a year then that is your choice. Some people praise DPR as being gods, this is ridiculous. I mean afterall, they believe in free will and free spirit, and just run a drug site and they are making bank, people act like they are doing this for free!!! IN FACT, they are making insane amounts of money. Only if everyone had intense knowledge of IT based occupations, IT secuirty, web based design and building blocks, security, money laundering, then anyone can make a similar site if they have the balls, just like Atlantis has done(I am still skeptical of that site)<br /><br />I have made enough of this site to live comfortably for at least 3 years without a job, and for that I am grateful. I had a connect in cali that I was shipping to and from for over a year before I even heard of this site before, and honestly it was easier to mail homeboy 14k in cash for a 5 pack bc he trusted me then to get bitcoins, hope the site is up, then message to message to get what I want. I stopped because he wouldn&#039;t care if a pack ever went missing hahah.<br /><br /><br />This site is one of many for the future, I DO commend DPR staff for fighting for what they believe in, whether it be money or the act of in believe for what they believe in. That is truly amazing, they will stand up and fight no matter what happens.<br /><br />Always fight in for what you believe on. Long live the road.<br /><br /><br />Always, <br />Nuggets5

				Well that version of the charter is actually shortened and refined a bit from the original one that I saw that inspired me so much, but still. It&#039;s obvious you guys don&#039;t share the same voluntarism ideals that I do, and because of that you&#039;ll never understand why this site is so significant in the way that those of us in the freedom movement do. You may not share my passion and you clearly don&#039;t see the historical significance of this organization, but that&#039;s okay. You can look at us as &quot;just a drug website&quot; all you want, but I promise you that history books will reflect my sentiments and not yours. We are dedicating every waking moment of our lives to freeing mankind from oppression, and even though we are just getting started we have already done more to alter the future of civilization then most of you could ever hope to achieve in 10 lifetimes. But go ahead, brush us off as worthless nobodies. You enjoy your slavery.<br /><br />I will add, that I completely understand the sycophancy toward DPR may be a little off-putting to a lot of you. But that&#039;s just a manifestation of how passionate we are about our beliefs, and how important it is to us to see change in our lifetimes. Many of us were the same way with Ron Paul, and will continue to give &quot;god-worthy praise&quot; to anyone who can bring the world closer to the free utopia we dream of. Once we get there, hopefully you will finally understand why we were so passionate about Silk Road.

				I love the Silk Road and think DPR and crew are doing an awesome thing, and they&#039;re doing it incredibly well. That said, I&#039;m no believer in libertarianism (sorry guys!). I have different ideas about how this site will effect society, and they are probably more modest and perhaps disappointing to DPR and those who understand his philosophy. But whatever, I think it will change things for the better, even if I don&#039;t think it will lead to the radical change I&#039;d like to see (or the radical change DPR would like to see).<br /><br />One &#039;worry&#039; (I don&#039;t actually worry about this) I have is that I think many will read the charter and find it to be simple &quot;common sense&quot; and will not really see the radicalism in it. This is not at all a criticism of the charter, just a hunch really. I would have been interested to read the full version, but oh well.<br /><br />@indigo - I agree it is more than people simply &quot;doing business&quot;, there is a great community here with people quite selflessly helping one another on a regular basis. Do you and/or DPR (and/or whoever else might be involved) think SR is likely to lead to some sort of social/political movement? And if you&#039;re not snowed under with work, feel free to elaborate! Not trying to be combative, just genuinely interested in your views.
