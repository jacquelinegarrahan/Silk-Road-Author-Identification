				well what you said about how ez it is to scam ppl is true. but all the stuff to stop the scamming is there ppl just dont use it. with ppl saying ok to finalizing early (yes finalizing early dose help us venders getting the money a few days sooner so we can buy more good and alike but open you up to getting rip off) just dont finalizing early also the out of escrow stuff. well i do like out of escrow for big orders. on the last one i did if i did it within escrow i have to add about a other $130 or so to the cost just to get the same money form it. so i see why ppl do it. well my point is the stuff to stop the scaming is there and dont let this one bad time stop you form buying. also there is no way to stop 100% of scaming there all ways will be some not just here on SR but all over. like your dealer in RL can just give you fake/bad stuff they leave town and you lost your money.

				I have seen Grey defend this guy before. <br />I will soon be posting all my messages. <br />They will leave no doubt combined with the other evidence the guy (CANT FEEL My FACE) is a scammer.<br />In what way I dont care. <br />He takes money and delivers nothing or something fake. (Both in his case.) There is ample evidence out there Grey why don&#039;t you let the people decide that are going to be getting screwed in the next few weeks. <br />I ain&#039;t worried. <br /><br />I am honestly trying to stop someone from ordering from a thief. <br /><br />G.V.<br />

You said that on Wednesday and I had to ask if you had got it in mail after i was willing to take the chance on delivery at small PO.<br /><br />If it really got in mail on Monday there is small chance it is still coming.<br /><br />If not then be straight up because I have been there and lets do this right.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />G.V.<br /><br />PS- I will let yo know tomorrow if it arrives.

				Check out the mid-november stuff from that dude with almost same responses. <br />I bet he has been doing since then and the good posts are him giving himself feedback. <br />Nothing prevents someone from doing that. <br />Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. <br /><br />There are almost all awesome people here which is rare. <br /><br />But for me, the depth of scum at the top and the denial of the leaders to look at it is too much. <br /><br /><br />The Street Is More Attractive.<br /><br /><br />G.V

So if he was a scammer, he wouldn&#039;t be getting all the positive feedback he&#039;s getting. <br /><br />When you look at the numbers .. add up the amount of good feedback on CFMF on his vendor page. Then look at the forums. Its a 20, even 30:1 ratio of good to the occasional person (such as yourself) accusing him of being a thief. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not doubting you - but some evidence would help your case. Right now, if I do as you suggest and check the last 30 days of CFMF feedback (both here and on the vendor feedback), there&#039;s only a few cases of disgruntled customers. There are people that ordered from him a week or so ago who only just got their orders. <br /><br />Where are you based GV?<br /><br />Grey

				I have a feeling he&#039;s a scammer. <br /><br />I&#039;m new on SR so he sent me a message telling me to finalize early. I did, and rated him 5/5 because it was &quot;in transit&quot; very quickly. I didn&#039;t know I had to save the URL to edit my feedback, so my 5/5 rating will remain on his record.<br /><br />Now its 9 days after it was supposedly &quot;in transit&quot; and still no package.

				Well, it is Christmas rush, and all delivery services love to fuck up this time of year.<br /><br />I&#039;d wait until it&#039;s at least 12 or 13 days, and then click on &#039;resolve&#039; and contact the vendor and ask them what they suggest the next move should be. I personally wouldn&#039;t fuck with my feedback rating until I&#039;d exhausted all avenues with the vendor first.<br /><br />Be polite and patient, and 99% of the time you&#039;ll be rewarded with a good working relationship with the vendor in question.<br /><br />Best of luck.

				I have to agree with Garyvogel and SRTRAVELER. I have been ordering from CFMF, TV, GJ and Slappy. About 80% of the orders are pure crap.<br />The other 20% are highly cut. The one positive point is that all orders arrived in a very timely manner and stealthy, for what it matters.<br /><br />It&#039;s too bad because CFMF had the potential. My patience has also run dry........<br /><br />I suggest that we buyers can go back and set all of our purchase feedback to 1. That would send a message. I may only have one post, but <br />how much feedback I can influence is the real question. There have been too many 5/5 gifted. <br /><br />Another observation is that the shipments from CFMF seemed to have stopped when the .onion URL changed. Out of character for CFMF. <br />Is there some connection? <br /><br />In short BUYER BEWARE.<br /><br />I was going to try paperchasing, but after his tantrum, I decided not. Kinda reminds me of a cat trying to cover up his chit in the sandbox.<br /><br /><br />

				Sorry, let me get this straight. You are saying that out of all of the orders you have received from the top coke dealers on here ALL of them have been either crap or heavily cut (is there a difference?). Please define crap coke if it is not heavily cut, I am not sure what you mean.

				I have received from CFMF - sure its not the most pure ever, but it did arrive. Maybe has had some problems as of late? Also TV is very reliable, there may have been a batch a few months ago that had a little amphet but lately its been killer. Also you do know that you can clean cutting agent out of coke? http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27089<br /><br />If it has 10% cut, you can flush that out no problems, I&#039;ve done it and maybe out of 3.5g lost .2 - .3 but the end result was PURE.

				&quot;WELL YEAH I PAID OUT OF ESCROW BUT STILL ITS NOT FAIRRRRRR!!! THE SYSTEM IS FLAWED!!!!&quot;<br /><br />Boo fucking hoo. You fucked up. The system is set up to avoid this, and you took a shortcut that cost you an order. I can certainly empathize, but come on.<br /><br />I do not know CFMF, and have never ordered from him. But based on my IRL experience, I&#039;d be willing to wager that if someone (assuming he is not an intentional scammer, which it is possible) bought from him a few times, got some &quot;highly cut&quot; and not &quot;crap&quot;, and brought it up that CFMF would ease it up on the baking soda/amphet/whatever bullshit it may be, and help you out. <br /><br />This world is built solely on trust, reliability, and of course product. But you can use any of the three to reach any of the others...<br /><br /><br />Done ranting here. CFMF may indeed be a scammer, and may indeed have some shitty yayo. Just wanted to point out that garyvogel helped contribute to the unreliability of the system, only caused by its misuse, and then claimed it was flawed... really?

				I&#039;m fairly new to SR.&nbsp; Been around a few months but only have so many orders (10+-).&nbsp; I have a feeling one of my recent orders may have been a scam, serves me right for not doing my homework on the seller like I usually do, but I&#039;ll have to wait and see if the stuff shows up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I knew that was the name of the game when I started here.&nbsp; Our job as buyers is harm reduction - we need to do what we can to reduce the inherent risk that the current SR system poses to ourselves.&nbsp; This goes for all aspects of using SR, not just buying. <br /><br />Also, I have been scammed IRL too.&nbsp; Sure it&#039;s much easier to get away with it on SR but still...&nbsp; Bottom line is do the positives outweigh the negatives of using this service?&nbsp; For the OP I guess not, but for me hell&#039;s fucking yeah.

				I could not resist checking back to see if I was right.<br />Now there is an actual Thread about CFMF being a scammer. <br /><br />Here is what I have learned. <br /><br /><br />You all make some good points. <br /><br />ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS use escrow. ( Although there are one or two people on here I trust enough STILL not to)<br /><br />Beware that the very nature of this game is a scam and proceed from there.<br /><br />All in all it made me better for it. I lost not much with CFMF but my point was never that.<br /><br /><br />MY POINT WAS THAT MAYBE SR COULD TAKE A LOOK AT HOW TO MAKE THIS A BETTER PLACE FOR THE BUYER AND THE SELLER BY SCREENING FOR SCUM OR LISTENING WHEN MORE THAN ONE PERSON SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />Thanks and happy holidays,<br /><br />G.V.

				I agree with greyvogel. If more than one seller is feeling the pinch maybe it&#039;s time for the mods to swoop in. After all it&#039;s SR which will lose out in the long run to scammers. The scammers will walk away with the cash. The buyers who are not comfortable enough will move out and ask others not use SR. SR will have fewer people and a bad reputation in no time. Maybe the deposits need to go upto $1000. $250 or whatever it is SR is charging isn&#039;t enough. <br /><br />The 6% vendors pay out should be increased to 15% for new vendors and when volumes peak for a vendor. If he is making way too many trades in a few hours maybe hike it again to 30% which gets released after 2 weeks with no scam results. SR has to be made safer. SR is a good thing.

				And wouldn&#039;t not scamming be part of making your customers happy?&nbsp; There are so many forum topics on the risks of OOE, and probably about 15 vendors that are actually good for it and have earned the rep to do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a buyer/seller discretion thing, and if a buyer wants to take the plunge, really, what&#039;s going to stop him?&nbsp; And if he gets scammed?&nbsp; I still think most of that can be avoided with a lot of due diligence.&nbsp; When buyers do direct-buy from me I don&#039;t make them finalize early, because I want the feedback and to track the product and shipping times, so if you roll over to my feedback what you won&#039;t see is 75% of my feedback history saying &quot;finalized early&quot;.&nbsp; I think that should be a huge red flag for a buyer - if you&#039;re shucking off some of the armor, might as well make sure it&#039;s with someone who isn&#039;t going to stab you in the kidney.

				That&#039;s why it&#039;s integral to keep updated on the scammer threads.&nbsp; You never know when a seller might decide to bag it up and take a few weeks worth of buys as a going-away present.<br /><br />Once you start seeing even a few reports trickle in, those hairs on the back of your neck should be standing up.<br /><br />Also, remember, rank is not everything.&nbsp; I&#039;m ranked fairly low, but that&#039;s because I do a TON of direct-buy business (my &quot;custom/bulk orders&quot; listing is the 5th most popular weed listing on SR), so my dollar volume doesn&#039;t weight as high against my rank as sellers that force early finalize - this is what I consider to be the last way to &quot;game&quot; the system.&nbsp; If you can get a bunch of buyers to early finalize it pushes up your rank like crazy because your dollarvolume/time/transactions spikes against sellers who are using the process normally (even on direct-buy orders I don&#039;t like customers to finalize until they have received so I can track shipping times).&nbsp; This entices even MORE buyers in.<br /><br />I would say, if you guys are actually going to finalize early, leave a 1 or 2 feedback and write &quot;finalize early - left 1 feedback until item received&quot;.&nbsp; This will get sellers to be more likely to actually send stuff out the door, and also have them follow up to remind you to edit feedback once you receive.&nbsp; &nbsp;This will display the proportionate early-finalize versus legit transactions for buyers checking out the seller.&nbsp; Any buyer who doesn&#039;t do this is doing the community no favors.&nbsp; It will also keep seller rank in check for those planning on doing a scam sweep and sucking in a whole bunch of new buyers because their rank is so good (I guarantee that #16 was almost entirely from early finalizers).&nbsp; <br /><br />Either way, stay sharp out there.&nbsp; And if you want weed or mushrooms, I&#039;m here for you :)<br /><br />Anarcho47

				&nbsp;???<br /><br />How is it not possible to just do virtual buys over and over and give yourself 5* and &#039;aamaziiing&#039; comments to get your rating up massively? It doesn&#039;t require a brain, just clicking over and over. Given half one, you could script that even. This could be the only thing you do on SR, apart from scamming the real humans.<br /><br />For better results yet, what stops you from picking a 10% of your users randomly (or maybe according to how fast they finalize and leave 5* comments) and just wank them around, while serving the others? Maybe while doing the above, too, giving you a 9&lt;high&gt;% feedback overall? You&#039;d still have the 90% of actual humans served to defend you in forums (well... assuming they would get off their asses) and make you look legit.<br /><br />So, &quot;use escrow&quot;. Great, but I&#039;m a new buyer, and they won&#039;t sell unless I finalize early, so where do I start exactly?<br /><br />I am not talking about this CFMF guy specifically, as I don&#039;t know anything the fuck wrt that, but what Gary whines about so eloquently could very easily be done.<br /><br />I _actually am_ a new buyer, so if I&#039;m seeing this wrong, please explain.

Will he actually cancel my order if it is my first?<br /><br />Will these comments soon be bumped by glaring 5*s? Is there a limit to feedback?<br /><br />Another option is MrYellow. &quot;All must FE&quot;, feedback 5/5 with FE, further back on feedback people who still haven&#039;t received. Nothing on forums. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Bikerbum</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">SilkRoad profits from SCAMMERS just as they do from legitimate VENDORS.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It may well do, but I would imagine there is a lot of money to be made here.

				Dude, there are a few shitty vendors here, most are pretty damn good considering what they do and what they put up with.&nbsp; Sure, SR profits off of finalized transactions from scammers.&nbsp; THERE ARE VENDORS THAT WILL NOT REQUIRE FE.&nbsp; Even for someone new.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never FE once, MANY transactions, never been taken.&nbsp; The only time I&#039;ve ever FE was w/ someone on here that I had done 10+ transactions w/ and it was out of SR completely.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just find someone that doesn&#039;t require FE, like some xanax, something cheap, do it 5 times, then people won&#039;t require it of you.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t afford to do that, you probably shouldn&#039;t be buying drugs in the first place.&nbsp; <br /><br />And for vendors that require FE, don&#039;t use them period.&nbsp; Why risk it.&nbsp; I can&#039;t think of a single vendor on here that requires FE that doesn&#039;t have a competitor that doesn&#039;t require FE.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why do I keep responding to a 6 month old thread - jesus I&#039;m bored!

				I actually think this thread has some use historically as new customers are sometimes reluctant to use my cash in the mail service for Bitcoins as they&#039;re worried about being scammed. <br /><br />Hopefully now they see how easy it is for someone to complain in very public terms about the service they&#039;ve received if it&#039;s not up to scratch. I hope everybody can now see that it&#039;s in a vendor&#039;s best interest to provide a reliable and honest service.<br /><br />V.
