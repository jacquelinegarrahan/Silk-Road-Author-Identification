				I really mean it. Fuck nomad bloodbath, DigitalAlch and ChronicPain.<br /><br />Seriously, sometimes those guys are such fucking dickheads, it really pisses me off.<br /><br />I hope those assholes end up drinking and partying too much and puking all over themselves.<br /><br />And I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one that wants to see those lick-spittle cretins writhing in a pool of their own vomit, dropping their spliff&nbsp; roach in the toilet as they lean over it, swearing they&#039;ll never drink again. Can&#039;t you just picture them awaking the next day, or perhaps &#039;coming too&#039; would be a more accurate description, with grit in their eyes, the neighbors cat sleeping in their mouth, all the while their walnut-sized brains attempt to rhythmically burst through their thick skulls, while their apoplectic livers attempt to trade places with their bleeding spleens. *sigh*<br /><br />So come now; can you feel my dream, can you imagine its power, and don&#039;t you want to make it your dream too?<br /><br />I mean, don&#039;t you want to see those useless smegma-stains fucking suffer!<br /><br />To assist in fulfilling this dream, I&#039;ve just sent ChronicPain and DigitalAlch $25 each, and because I *really* want nomad bloodbath to retch, cause he&#039;s here way more than the other guys and therefore is way more fucking annoying, he&#039;s got $50.<br /><br />But I&#039;m not stopping there, I want to make sure those shit eating sonofabitches rue the very day they started modding here.<br /><br />So to further my diabolical plan, I&#039;ll match dollar for dollar, up to $100, everyone who makes a confirmed similar payment to assist in the furtherance of my sinister dream. Simply skip over to SR and send some soon to be pain-causing bitcoins to their accounts, and then drop back here and post about it, and I&#039;ll gleefully curse them under my breath as I match your payment.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t got the BTC today, at least show your support for my dream and come in the thread and pledge something for the future. It doesn&#039;t have to be a big amount, as every little bit helps. Make it 0.1 BTC and call out their resemblance to syphilitic baboons, drop a whole bitcoin and cast dispersions on their ancestry, or go big or go home and fire in 10 BTC split between them and let them have it with a profanity laced rant and what you really think of their pus-brained political leanings.<br /><br />Help me show those neanderthal cock-bites what we really think of them, fucking tossers that they are.<br /><br />Yeah, we&#039;ll show those wankers.<br /><br />[Edit: was having problems with the goddam fucking attachment]

				I agree with MacGruber. I&#039;ve been using SR for months now, and posted here a couple of times and then decided I shouldn&#039;t post under the same name I buy under. I started this account about a month ago, but haven&#039;t posted because I&#039;ve found what I need just by reading these forums.<br /><br />And yes I&#039;d love to see the mods regretting the previous evenings escapades, and would love to help inflict that pain on the jerks.<br /><br />Mark me down for 2 bitcoins to each of the mods, will be sent from my buyers account today.<br /><br />Great fucking idea Shabang.<br /><br />It is interesting to see who posts here without actually reading the thread, and don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />MacGruber, madamebradley and mseller get it, at least.

				I haven&#039;t had time to come over to the forum for a month and today I just happened to see this subject line and decided to read it.<br /><br />Lovely, truly lovely. :D<br /><br />And it&#039;s great because I know mseller and his first language isn&#039;t even English but he&#039;s got more sense for satire than a lot of the people who post here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Truly brilliant.<br /><br />If I ever make an actual profit selling products on this web site I will surely send something good to each of them to cause their most hasty demise.&nbsp; <br /><br />This one post was enough to put a smile back on my face to go face the next 150 pm&#039;s asking if their order shipped today.&nbsp; I wonder if the fact that answering those pm&#039;s prevents me from getting around to sending out shipping confirmations until midnight ever enters.....nah....never mind. <br /><br />You all have fun here.&nbsp; Oh, and it&#039;s &quot;aspersions&quot; unless you really just want their ancestors spread out dramatically in some fashion all over the globe.&nbsp; hahaha!&nbsp; JK, gotta get mine in too! :o

				Yeah,<br /><br />This lot is the typical ham-fisted arrogant bunch of internet asshole moderators.

Read between the lines you dim-bulbs).<br /><br />I offer this pack of slavering dimbulb 3 btc each. Not to get blasted with, but to go out and perhaps purchase that wonderful new invention. Soap.

				I&#039;d just like to say that good things came of me donating to the mods here.<br /><br />A couple of hours ago, due to a thread I was involved in here, I decided to finally pull the trigger and purchase a vendor account.<br /><br />Of course, because I had donated 6 BTC to the mods the other day I didn&#039;t have enough fundage in my account to make the purchase. So, I fired up my bitcoin wallet and transferred additional funds into my account, and then sat around tapping my toes, waiting for them to arrive at Silk Road.<br /><br />Like I said, that was about 2 hours ago, and BTC was at $3.19 at the time. When I came back 2 hours later not only had my transfer arrived, but BTC was at $3.82! (See the attached image for the Mt. Gox graph showing the dramatic and sudden rise.)<br /><br />So, because I had donated to the mods and therefore delayed grabbing a vendors account by 2 hours, I actually saved over 8 BTC!<br /><br />Plus, I&#039;m pretty sure my penis is a little bit bigger too!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />
