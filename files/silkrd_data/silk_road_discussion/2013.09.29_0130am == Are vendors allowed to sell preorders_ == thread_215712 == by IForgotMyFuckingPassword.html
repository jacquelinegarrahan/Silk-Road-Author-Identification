				Pre-order as in a $350 USD box of Roxi&#039;s that the vendor hasn&#039;t got. I wasn&#039;t aware you could list what you don&#039;t have yet. I came across this while trying to help someone in the newbie section. I&#039;m just curious for future reference. I&#039;m clueless about vending, although I&#039;ll probably be moving over to the seller side in the next 6 weeks.<br /><br />That&#039;s shit&#039;s fucking crazy to me and it looks like a trap for the stupid. I hate people that take advantage of others; it&#039;s especially sleazy when it comes to addiction.

				it happens. it was more common before the bond went up. Sometimes vendors have supply and liquidity issues, but their feedback will often reflect the slow speed when they have to go pick shit up, and it will also require FE which many buyers are not comfortable with. I&#039;m not positive if that&#039;s what you&#039;re asking but I think that covers it :)

They help vendors see how much they need to get, plus it allows buyers to enter a queue and ensure that they are not offline when the product gets sold out. <br />I never used to do preorders however so many customers messaged requesting me to put up a preorder so they could ensure they get some of my next batch, so I started doing it. <br /><br />It&#039;s not like I make the listing pretending I have the product.

That&#039;s something you&#039;ve either got in stock or you don&#039;t. I understand that with something like weed, you might want to figure out how much you can move before you buy it, but $350 is a lot to plunk down on something that the person doesn&#039;t have. And unlike weed, this only comes in one size. <br /><br />I made no comment about you personally. You are an established vendor; this person is brand new. And the reason I asked the question in the forum was to find out if it was allowed before I reported him (which I didn&#039;t do). I wouldn&#039;t want to make more work for the admins then they&#039;ve already got.<br /><br />Besides, Roxis are one of the most in demand drugs (as far as opioids go). My grandma could move cases and cases of Roxis. It&#039;s not really something you would ever be stuck with.<br /><br />PS You&#039;re buds look fucking fantastic. I&#039;m gonna have to give you a try next time I order.

				Apologies if my words came across strong as well =P. It is just because I had a preorder and the a customer message 1 day later complaining why it is not marked in transit when the listing clearly said in capitals THIS IS A PREORDER. <br /><br />Just wanted to show that preorders are not used for scamming and such

				I used to put up preorder listings for my Subutex because my regulars would want to make sure they got theirs before they sold out. I never had any complaints about it personally, but I didn&#039;t require early finalization or anything so I can see how that could pose an issue.
