				The down times are due to how popular this site is becoming. You can&#039;t expect a hidden website as flooded as this one is to be lightning fast. Regardless, I&#039;d get used to it. I doubt you&#039;ll find a better alternative to SR.

				but seriously, don&#039;t bitch about SR issues unless your ready to put up your own site. There are plenty of forums out there, but if you can&#039;t find them, make your own. I have FH invites if that&#039;s what you want to do.

				There are at least two alternative sites to Silk Road that I know of.&nbsp; I wont name them hehehe (goats?&nbsp; And unloaded?)<br /><br />But, SR is still the best by far.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other sites are faster too.&nbsp; Many of he same vendors are there as well.<br />&nbsp;Cheaper prices, with less commissions.&nbsp; Some people make good connections there that are trustworthy.&nbsp; Many others get conned into sending money first and getting ripped.&nbsp; So,<br />SR has a better reputation for quality vendors while the others have more vendors, but poor quality vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, SR gets all the attention and userbase and many people attacking the site, many users, vendors, etc.&nbsp; I notice TOR software is what makes it slow.&nbsp; Try the site with a proxy and watch it fly.&nbsp; Not safe though.&nbsp; Very insecure using a proxy , but it does show the performance difference with and without TOR.<br /><br />

				BMR sucks, and you have to realize SR is not freaken amazon, with the popularity of the site there will be issues from time to time, you should be happy they are usually handled&nbsp; in a timely manner.

				Yes Silkroad has its issues and you are free to open a similar site without the issues you dont like. Its very easy to criticize something you are not running yourself. I understand that is frustrating but the fact is that you can order drugs online and it will arrive to your door and that is freaking incredible....it blows my mind the few people who complain bc their order arrived in a week or a week and a half when everything I order online personally usually takes from one week to a week and a half to arrive and sometimes more. Not that long ago we didn&#039;t even have supermarkets. We as a society have just gotten too spoiled in many respects hence why we are so impatient and demanding. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />However, a true free market is all about competition so I encourage you to start your own black market site.

If Silk Road runs incredibly slow and doesn&#039;t load sometimes how can we make it run faster and more reliably? If Bitcoin withdrawls are not being processed why not and what can we do to fix it? If scamers are preying on our community members can we think up some new ways of stoping them before they burn the next guy? What about an advertising campaign for Silk Road? What about messaging features that automatically encrypt and decrypt communications? What can we do to build consumer confidence? What can we do to improve our rating system that can be easily manipulated?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;How can we all come together as a community to serve our common interests and build something that will have meaningful impact for generations to come?<br /><br />No one can do everything everyone can do something

				We can&#039;t fix them.&nbsp; I mean really, we can&#039;t; I got so fed up I started writing my own client to get around the bullshit that would take 2 hours to fix if I had access to the server.&nbsp; Well, I&#039;m also a nerd who likes doing that stuff, to be fair, but anyway.<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame someone who gives a fuck doesn&#039;t seem to have access to anything at all anymore -- which I&#039;m not dropping a hint about, seriously, I&#039;m too high strung for that kind of stress -- I&#039;m just saying that if everyone knew just how easy it would be to do some of the things people ask for... well, some people around here would be even more pissed off than they already are, let&#039;s just say that.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure DPR has much of anything to do with the site anymore.&nbsp; Great guy, if he was ever real to begin with.&nbsp; I certainly liked what little I knew anyway.&nbsp; Maybe he&#039;s just throwing his arms up in the air when faced with the insanity of dealing with all the new people every, single, fucking, day... but justified or not, the fact remains that he seems to care very little at this point.<br /><br />I think we&#039;re just lucky enough to have a couple of great people still working the resolution &amp; support departments; but unless someone else gets the keys to the Road... eh, not to be dramatic, but any business that stands still eventually crumbles to dust.&nbsp; I mean that&#039;s how business works, right?&nbsp; Expand or die?&nbsp; Until you can&#039;t expand anymore, turn into Apple, and fuck everything up all slow &amp; stuff... that&#039;s what always seems to happen, anyway.<br /><br />Who knows how long it&#039;ll take, but as fond as I am of SR, someone/thing will take it&#039;s place if it just keeps sinking slowly the way it has as more people jump on board.&nbsp; Sooner, later, whatever.&nbsp; It&#039;ll happen.<br /><br />So, back to the original question: other than the sheepy thing and BMR, anybody got any alternatives to bookmark for a rainy day...?&nbsp; :)<br />

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as easy as you may display it SS.<br /><br />Every single line of code added to the website needs to be VERY thoroughly evaluated if you don&#039;t want to bring more threats to the community.<br /><br />And SR is not just a normal business. Maybe it doesn&#039;t want/need to expand that much. The more SR gets public attention, the more people attempting to bring it down.<br /><br />And you can&#039;t just bring new people in like that, no matter how skillful they are, everyone working on the core of SR could probably bring the site down in a matter of minute.<br /><br />Furthermore, even if basic functionalities are not implemented at all or very slowly, that doesn&#039;t mean that someone isn&#039;t working on the security mechanisms in the background.<br /><br />And security is much more important than any rating system or any other feature highly requested out there.<br /><br />Better safe than sorry !

There is allways room for improvement.&nbsp; Instead of say why we can&#039;t&nbsp; say how can we make improvements. What if silk road was set up in a way that each user could write the code for their own vendor page and listings? What if we worked with the people at tor so that more users could host tor relays and users could have their own personal server to help improve the speed of the site along with security. What if each user could have their own server with their own personal firewall so that silk road would have a hard outershell and a hard inner shell.

				Your level headed calmness is admirable, anon.&nbsp; I mean that, but I happen to believe that in this case it&#039;s mistaken.<br /><br />Security is not making changes to the live site and fucking up withdrawals and deposits before anybody knows anything has even changed.&nbsp; Security is not implementing a &quot;forgot your passphrase&quot; for 12-24 hours before deciding it was a very bad idea and removing it.&nbsp; Customer service is not refusing to implement a sorting by price feature after being given 2 years to do so.&nbsp; You want the SQL query that would do it?&nbsp; I&#039;ll even do the dev&#039;s work for them, how&#039;s that:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">SELECT category, product<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FROM listings_database JOIN product<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ON price WHERE price BETWEEN(user_choice_min, user_choice_max)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SORT BY price ;<br /></code><br />... something like that.&nbsp; It&#039;s been over a year since I wrote a word of SQL, but you get my point, hopefully.&nbsp; Unless the man is as disabled as Stephen Hawking, I can&#039;t imagine him being unable to write that, plug it in to whatever not-fucking-live site that&#039;s laying around to test with, and be done with it.&nbsp; I sincerely, logically believe that if SR continues to stand still, it will be gone for 2014.&nbsp; If I&#039;m wrong, so be it: I&#039;ll still be here buying drugs along with the rest of you if it&#039;s still around.&nbsp; But I just don&#039;t see that as very likely.<br /><br />P.S. edit: I sound more like masterblaster than I mean to.

I am actually working on a black market site myself, is just that I have so many projects at once that I dont know how long till I finish the site. I see that Silkroad needs improvement ofcourse, everyone does but I am also so happy that in my generation a black market like silkroad was born and is still up and running and I keep in mind that DPR always ends up fixing whatever goes wrong and has never stolen from anyone. He initiated something amazing and deserves credit and appreciation for it...its now up to us to step it up and create competition for Silkroad...DPR has done his part.<br /><br />I cant wait till improved versions of Silkroad are born. In my lifetime multiple popular black markets that are better than silkroad will be born and I am confident that this will be the case in less than 10 years. DPR has done already more than most people for the cause of freedom and the war on drugs and I hope we also become leaders ourselves and give him some competition, this way the movement grows and becomes stronger and unstoppable. Silk road is just the beginning.

				<br /><br /><br />I agree it needs to improve but also feel people are ungrateful. However, I am been genuine when I encourage OP to open a black market place that is an improved version of Silkroad bc I bet that if someone opens such market place and gets it to become popular people will start to leave silkroad and silkroad will be forced to step it up, that is what competition does and Silkroad is about three years old tops so it can be done, a new better market place can be born...Silkroad become very popular within a year.<br /><br />Anyways appreciate your input.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />&nbsp;I understand you argument that competition leads to better overall results for the consumers. Which happen to be us, vendors and buyers. However that argument is not allways true. In some cases a regulated monopoly is the best option for consumers. This happens to be the case with power companies, in some places phone companies and other utilities and other business with a large increasing economy to scale. Meaning the larger a business becomes in relation to market share the more efficient it becomes. If there were multiple power companies to choose from the rates would not be cheaper they would be more expensive. The main barriors of entry&nbsp; to deep web drug commerce is: 1. knowing that a site like SR exists. 2. Having the technical understanding of computers, tor, and bitcoin to be able to operate. 3. Having the consumer confidence in a site like sr to be able to trust that everything will operate as planned. I&nbsp; believe that having everyone in the deep web on one extemely efficient drug commerce site like Silk Road will allow the deep web to compete better against traditional forms of drug trade. Opposed to all the deep web drug commerce divided between multiple sites. Silk Road and the deep web still have a great deal of market share to take from traditional forms of drug trafficing. I believe that after a few small improvements Silk Road and the deep web in general can replace traditional forms of drug trafficing, because it fixes the flaws with traditional drug trafficing. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their will be a time for competitor sites to Silk Road, but in my opinion that time will be after the deep web has taken a far greater share of the overall drug market.

Prices are updated multiple times every day so you would have to take that into your reasoning.<br />I wouldn&#039;t ever tell someone his setup his bad until I actually can take a look at it fully which none of us can.<br /><br />2) SR has been there for quite a long time. The longevity of SR on itself should show that it&#039;s handled quite very well actually.<br /><br />3) If it would be that easy to create an anonymous marketplace and keep it alive for a long time. There would probably be a ton of them around here but there isn&#039;t as far as I know.<br /><br />4) The biggest threat for SR would be in my humble opinion an internal threat. It would totally destroy all of the staff and all that has been achieved so far by SR.<br /><br />5) If I were to handle such a site, I would definitely keep a VERY small and tight staff. If you just recruit new people proportionally to SR business size, you would exponentially increase risk for everyone.<br />Plus, I&#039;m sure DPR thinks first of his security before any other concerns and he is right to do so. Do you have any idea what&#039;s at stake ? Freedom.<br /><br />If the cost for SR to last for a few more years is to enhance the website very slowly, then I would think it&#039;s definitely worth keeping it that way. Keep it simple !<br /><br />Anyway SS, I&#039;m sure tomorrow will be a much better day ! Don&#039;t turn into a masterblaster :)

				A good alternative to SR needs to focus on user experience. That&#039;s what allows a newcomer to accumulate enough network effect to overcome first mover advantage. It is possible for an upstart to overtake SR. Focus on user experience, and all the potheads will beat a path to your site.

				Long live SR. I looked at BMR during the downtime just to see it. Maybe it&#039;s just me but I found these forums and the ability to check out the vendors easier here. I have had some deals have issues that had some issues but I have been pretty lucky to have nearly 100% good relationships with vendors. I&#039;ve also checked out some of the hidden wiki vendors, not worth the risk without escrow. Plus we have art and apparel here :) Competition is healthy evolution is necessary and one of these day ima get that Northface coat... <br /><br />On a serious note though SR will stay on top if it keeps up with the quickly changing technologies and evolving practices of shippers and LE and helps its users learn and understand continually.
