				This person is at it again.&nbsp; Here is the message.<br /><br />Hi, I&#039;m not sure if you are the right person or not, but I live near to you and have noticed you recieving quite a few deliveries to the mailbox, some of which I managed to get on video... search for &#039;silk road local delivery&#039; on www.videoupload.us and click on the the first video and you will be able to see.<br /><br />This is not a threat, I am just trying to pre warning you to be more careful when ordering packages. (and maybe send someone else to the mailbox instead of yourself)<br /><br />P.S If it is not you in the video, then you can ignore this<br /><br />Aaron<br /><br />In reality, they don&#039;t know that all the packages I receive are Beanie Babies.&nbsp; I feel they are a good long-term investment.

				Did the guy state how much he was trying to blackmail you for? :o :o :o :o<br /><br />I bet this would work well on weed vendors who are paranoid from the weed they are constantly smoking.

				This has come up before, but we might as well revisit it.<br /><br />Maybe creating an account can be free, but before you can send people messages, you have to fund it with $200. This is like a buyer bond,&nbsp; but you get 100% of it back as you purchase items. You can always withdraw it, but then you can&#039;t message anyone anymore, and the messages you sent are automatically deleted.<br /><br />When you get purchases totaling $200, this restriction is lifted, and you can message people with 0 BTC in your account.<br /><br />Perhaps there are better strategies, but one thing is clear, the SR messaging system is being heavily abused, and something should be done.<br />
