				Hey fellow roaders. Well I guess now it EX-roaders :( At first I was telling my customers to go to BMR over as it has been around pretty much as long as SR so I trusted it more but I never used either market. After two days of being set up on both, I can say that I VERY VERY much prefer the sheep marketplace over BMR. I think the BMR interface SUCKS. It is NOT user friendly, not nearly as pretty looking and just kind of seems like a ghetto set up. The sheep market actually has a very nice interface, everyone was saying they did not have escrow but THEY HAVE A GREAT ESCROW SYSTEM. I love how you can approve orders, and it keeps the address there until you actually mark it &quot;shipped&quot; i liked that much better because every once and a while I would mark an order shipped that I didn&#039;t mean to, this site makes you first approve the order, THEN gives you 5 days to get it shipped (it gives you 7 to approve it, or I could have it backwards lol) <br /><br />What is everyone else thinking? Also, I haven&#039;t got a single order on BMR but the sheep has been OK. It is no SR but it has only been 2 days and I already see ALL the old vendors and SO many of my old customers have moved over their. BMR is not accepting new buyer accounts right now due to the flood of traffic they are upgrading their system and many people did not have one when the road was up so I am seeing WAY more&nbsp; faces on sheep.<br /><br />So I am telling everyone to head on over there. Link to my profile is: http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion/account/profile/dd3e133e5306e701ff6e4b2da882856f<br /><br />FUCK THE FEDS, YOU ASSHOLES DID NOTHING BUT ARREST ONE GUY AND MAKE US LOSE SOME MONEY BUT WE ALL JUST MOVED OVER TO THE NEXT SITE YOU FUCKING LOSERS! THE ONLY REASON YOU TARGETED THIS SITE WAS BECAUSE DPR HAD A FUCKING HARD ON FOR FLAUNTING THE FEDS

				My issue with switching to either of these sites is that we are still taking the gamble that their administrators are not just going to run off with everything in escrow. Over time I&#039;ve come to trust SR and DPR. I am even less inclined to trust sheep marketplace simply because of the name. Seriously, sheep? Why the fuck would they name it that? Sketchy as all hell. <br /><br />I won&#039;t pretend to have any kind of in-depth knowledge of computer science and whatnot but it seems to me decentralization is the way to go. It&#039;s what saved online file-sharing, and it&#039;s what made purchasing bitcoins anonymously still possible in the face of feds going after the exchanges.

				you&#039;re going to make your choice based on a name. That sounds intelligent.<br /><br />If the name makes you not want to go there, it makes the feds see it as less of a threat as well. Seriously, how threatening is a sheep? Especially since a decent majority have focused on BMR as the &quot;new silk road,&quot; I imagine the feds will be there.<br /><br />Me personally, I will be checking out both and probably using both. Some vendors will even use both I&#039;m sure. The one with the smaller escrow fees will probably win in the end because they are able to offer lower prices, and I might find something on one site that I can&#039;t find on another.

				pharmacypowder: I had 3 gram order that had been marked &#039;in transit&#039; for at least 5 day or so before the site went down. Did that order actually make it into the mail, assuming you ship everything next day like you claim?&nbsp;

				Just made an order on BMR, it was pretty painless, slow yes, but nothing major. It was with an ex sr vendor TSC, so I know not to worry, I will update once received.&nbsp; I think sheep is obviously better due to its speed, but there is no feedbacks, no real history, no real feedback on vendors too.<br />Which ever you choose, dont expect it to be anything like the road until they have time to up their strategies.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

When i joined sheep they had 200 drug listings, yesterday they had 700+ and today they have over 1500 listings for drugs. Why run off with escrow money now, when theres so much more money to be made off of commissions down the road?

				Because more growth = more heat. While there is more money to be made from sticking around, another option is to simply steal what is in escrow for one big score and disappear before LE begins to view you as a problem.<br /><br />Not saying this is what is going to happen, or even that it&#039;s likely to happen, but it&#039;s a possibility.

That probably pointed many users in the direction of BMR. Now that it has been established that Sheep has escrow we should be able to make better judgement. No doubt that Sheep has by far the nicest interface. Based solely on appearance Sheep would win.<br /><br />However, I&#039;m a bit worried about how Sheep is run. Navigating through the forums over at Sheep I don&#039;t see any admins or moderators. Who is running that site? For example, there is a thread where dozens of users are screaming for escrow when there already is escrow. An admin could have explained this and put it to rest quickly.<br /><br />Judging from the help pages at Sheep, whoever wrote it does not have English as his native language. This could explain why admin isn&#039;t communicating so well. On the contrary, BMR seems to have an active admin in Backopy, and several helpful moderators.<br /><br />I wish we could have the Sheep site with the BMR staff in it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=218158.msg1590260#msg1590260">Quote from: lightonion on October 04, 2013, 07:48 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The one with the smaller escrow fees will probably win in the end because they are able to offer lower prices, and I might find something on one site that I can&#039;t find on another.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The commission fee has a subtle purpose besides generating revenue for the site. Vendors won&#039;t be able to make fake purchases just recycling his own bitcoins, thereby propping up his stats with fake reviews. The higher the commission fee, the less tempting it will be. Similarly, the commission fee discourages the behavior where vendor with bad intentions creates dummy customers buying from himself before going to &quot;real vendors&quot;. These dummy customers would then show their perfect buyer stats making purchases and then claiming that their stuff never arrived asking for refund. A commission fee dampens such behavior.

				If just Sheep allowed me to bookmark my vendors like SR did.<br />How can they come up with the album feature and not being able to select good vendors.<br />I came up with storing items over items on the cart just to take notice of good ex SR vendors
