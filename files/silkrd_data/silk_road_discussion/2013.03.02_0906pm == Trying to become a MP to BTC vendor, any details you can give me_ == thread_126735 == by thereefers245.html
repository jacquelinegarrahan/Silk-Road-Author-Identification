				Since there are so few of these of these vendors and it is a pretty easy way to get bitcoins to buyers fairly quickly with a fair amount of anonymity, I was thinking of getting a vendor account just to do this. It appears to not be illegal and a somewhat easy way to get some extra passive money. I&#039;m not sure how the process works though. Are the MP cashed through a paypal account, one that is registered in my own name? Or is it slightly more complicated and requires stealth and fake names? Can anyone fill me on the process and its risks? I&#039;d very much appreciate it, and since there seems to be a shortage of non scamming MP changers I could benefit the whole community.

				Man, before you even CONSIDER becoming an MP-to-BTC vendor, you need to do a LOT more research since you (and I quote) are &quot;not sure how the process works&quot; ....

				The short answer is :&nbsp; it&#039;s a lot more complicated due to the number of MPs you&#039;ll be processing.&nbsp; There are some limits, and also be aware that any funds you load to your PayPal account cannot be withdrawn without them freezing your account and yelling at you.&nbsp; So you&#039;ll also want to use some prepaid cards that can load MPs ... unfortunately, most require a SSN to use ... so it&#039;s definitely complicated unless you&#039;re just doing a small number of MPs.

				Research where, like on the clearnet? On how to convert BTC to paypal which is against paypal&#039;s terms of service? This is why I asked this in the first place, unless if you have reading comprehension difficulty, I was implying getting pointed in the right direction, instead of you getting on your bullshit high horse and bringing absolutely nothing productive to this conversation.

				No, like research here ... as in using the search function, or maybe getting in touch with one of the other vendors who does MP-to-BTC transactions.&nbsp; They&#039;re usually pretty willing to help.

				Thank you, thats pretty much what I asked for in the first place, though I had my doubts that vendors would want to give out potential trade secrets to potential competition, would have sufficed just fine originally

				I think that if you are up front about why you are asking, they&#039;ll be cool about it and help you out.&nbsp; Unfortunately it&#039;s a little difficult to find anonymous cards that don&#039;t require your SSN to use, but there are definitely some out there.

				Why not just be a Cash through mail to btc vendor in which you link up with another vendor.&nbsp; Vendor sends you the btc, you take overnight cash through mail from customers and you send them btc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take a fee you seem suitable for your time from either the vendor or customer or maybe half from both?<br /><br />Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Got to work out a few kinks like fluctuation in btc and trust but I&#039;d imagine this is 10x as easy to engineer as a large moneyback scheme.

				hey there, TBH i&#039;m not sure what MP stands for (Member of Parliment!? hahah)<br /><br />alot of people use localbitcoins, but iguess this is for much smaller amounts - are you asking OP, about setting up a &#039;proper&#039; BTC exchange like mtgox etc..??

				MP stands for Moneypak, the green dot money pak cards that you load with cash without ID, I&#039;d rather do that than through the mail since it adds more variables and physical items when I could do it over the computer much quicker and thus have much faster turnaround, I&#039;m going to be briefed by a MP changer at the site in a few days and hopefully I could get it started
