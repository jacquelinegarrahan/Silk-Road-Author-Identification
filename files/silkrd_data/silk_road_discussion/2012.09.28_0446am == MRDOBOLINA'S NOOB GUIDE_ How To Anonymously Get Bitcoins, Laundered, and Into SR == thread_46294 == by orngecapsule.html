Search the forums for alternatives<br /><br />So you&#039;re an eager no0b lurking these forums desperately looking for a straightforward, simple yet detailed stepbystep guide?<br />You&#039;re in luck because here you have EVERYTHING you need to: get bitcoins anonymously and discreetly, get them into your SR account, and most importantly keep yourself ANONYMOUS and completely out of harm&#039;s way by laundering (erasing any trace or footprint of where your bitcoins came from, giving you the current options / services and explaining the WHOLE process, giving you the peace of mind you deserve. This guide will also give you extremely useful additional tips to keep yourself safe and comfortable using SR. <br /><br />Reading this guide will give you all the answers allowing you to get your bitcoins anonymously, your options explained how to launder them (erasing all trace of footprints of where the coins originated from, then get your bitcoins into your SR account!<br />Reading this guide will completely show you how to navigate SR, and will explain what the SR Escrow System, FE, Finalize, Resolve features MEAN and their purposes.<br />This guide will also give you additional tips to keep yourself safe comfortable using SR. <br /><br />Getting Bitcoins is for USA only. but ALL THE OTHER information about laundering bitcoins, tips, SR&#039;s Features etc, is universally applicable. An international Guide is on it&#039;s way!<br /><br />*GRAHAMGREEN&#039;S CORRECTIONS TO THIS GUIDE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE READ. SCROLL DOWN FOR HIS EXPERT REVISIONS, DETAILED ADDITIONS AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFORMATION WRITTEN BY A MUCH MORE EXPERIENCED ROADER&nbsp; &amp; VENDOR WHOM I CONSIDER A TRUE GENTLEMAN AND GURU -<br /><br />the other guides use mtgox, which freezes your account if you&#039;re using TOR, which is lame. i chose blockchain.info instead because it&#039;s very popular here, and after weeks of intense research my conclusion: blockchain is the best online wallet for my needs. <br />why? tor accessible, cool interface, flexible send options, highest security, etc.<br /><br />Here we go:<br /><br />1) Under TOR go to www.blockchain.info set up an account (use a mailinator or any disposable email to register)<br /><br />2) Login to blockchain and click on &#039;Wallet&#039;<br /><br />3) Click on &#039;Receive Money&#039;. there you&#039;ll see your bitcoin address.&nbsp; (a btc address looks like this: 2tnMhKfSAf97f4wJc6dr8toj6iaxy7y)<br /><br />4) Go to www.bitinstant.com&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />- Pay From: select &#039;Major Bank Branch&#039;<br />- Pay To: select &#039;Bitcoin Address&#039;<br />Under you&#039;ll see:<br />- Bitcoin Address: put your bitcoin address copied and pasted from Blockchain. <br />- Amount: whatever your heart desires<br />- Email: put in a random mailinator address<br /><br />5) You will now be directed to a Trustcash site.<br />- submit your zip code and click &#039;Choose Location&#039; for the closest bank to you<br />- enter a fake name. enter your mailinator email you used for Bitinstant<br /><br />6) click &#039;Print Deposit Invoice&#039;<br />- you now have your paper printed and ready to bring to the bank.<br />- this paper has NO information about your phony name, NOTHING mentioning anything bitcoin related..&nbsp; NOTHING is on this paper but an account and routing number.<br /><br />7) Go to the bank with this printed paper and cash<br />- give the bank teller the paper. she will simply read the account and routing number off the paper and take your cash. then she&#039;ll return the paper.<br />- if asked, simply say you&#039;re paying a bill. they never ask.. never.<br />- absolutely NO ID is required. if asked for it, scoff and say you never needed it before and you left it at home.. but they won&#039;t ask.<br /><br />- remember paying bills at a bank is an everyday completely normal thing. millions of people go to banks daily depositing cash into people&#039;s or business&#039;s accounts for legitimate regular reasons.<br />- also remember buying bitcoins is LEGAL. <br /><br />that&#039;s it!&nbsp; the bitcoins will show up in your Blockchain wallet literally within minutes.<br /><br />theoretically now you can send your bitcoins directly to SR now, but lets it play safe and &quot;launder&quot; your coins to blot out any sort of &quot;paper trail&quot;. The idea behind laundering your coins is obvious: erase the link between the coins and you. So don&#039;t be impatient / lazy. Follow these steps to PROMISE your anonymity.<br /><br />1) Go to instawallet.org and it will give you your own secret site with your own unique bitcoin address. make sure to bookmark this instawallet page because if you lose or refresh this link, you lose anything in it.<br />- this can be replaced with any e-wallet of your choice.<br /><br />2) Now go back to your Blockchain wallet and click on &quot;Send Money&quot;<br />- simply enter your Instawallet bitcoin address and the amount, send payment.<br /><br />Now your bitcoins have been sent from Blockchain to your Instawallet <br /><br />The next 2 steps are optional and not necessary, and can be skipped. BUT if you&#039;re meticulous and rightfully PARANOID like me, you should continue with the next 2 steps. If you don&#039;t give a fuck, go ahead and skip to step 5.<br /><br />3) Now open up an Easywallet page, which will give you another unique bitcoin address. This is your second bitcoin address. (bookmark also)<br /><br />4) Send your bitcoins from your first Instawallet page to your second Easywallet address.<br /><br />5) now go to SR, and click on Account<br />- there you&#039;ll see your SR bitcoin address<br /><br />6) Go to your Easywallet that has your coins, and simply enter your SR bitcoin address and press send!<br /><br />That&#039;s it, my darlings! Just be PATIENT and within a few hours or less you&#039;ll see your bitcoins in your SR account READY for your rascally crusades!<br /><br />If you&#039;re truly of the deranged, super paranoid kind you SHOULD use a site called Bitcoinfog. It&#039;s service that takes your coins, completely BLEACHING them for days. once done your coins are IMMACULATELY CLEAN.<br />You can do that instead of the instawallet steps or in addition to them. depends on your level of paranoia.<br /><br />It is advisable to tumble all Bitcoin that you don&#039;t want traced back to you. Not necessary, but advisable. BitcoinFog is not a free service. The service takes 1-3% fee on each deposit. No other fees are in place, no complex calculations based on the number of withdraws or similar. Minimum withdraw amount is 1.00 BTC.<br /><br />The method to use BitcoinFog securely is below, taken directly from their site (bitcoinfog.com):<br />&quot;Ideally you should deposit an amount of bitcoins to the Fog, wait some time (which will depend on how many users are using the service, right now in the starting phase we recommend a week) and request a withdrawal, which will not have the same amount as the original deposit, leaving some funds in the Fog. This way there is no practically reliable way to do statistical analysis on the block chain and link your deposits to your withdrawals.&quot;<br /><br />Some alternatives:<br />- Some people skip Instawallet altogether and only use Bitcoinfog which serves it&#039;s purpose just fine. Bitcoinfog is truly amazing.<br />Just requires PATIENCE.<br /><br />So to simplify the formula:<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; = SAFEST - most recommended. <br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; SR&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; considered safe, fast and secure. appropriate for most of us.<br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet&nbsp; &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; good enough for some, not for me. fastest<br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; Easywallet &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; safest, ultra-paranoia stealth ninja mode, requires patience but provides the most peace of mind<br />- bitinstant &gt; Easywallet &gt; Bitcoin software &gt; BitcoingFog &gt; SR = extremely safe, no risk!<br /><br />As you can see, you have MANY options depending on your patience and paranoia level<br /><br />We recommend all new members to read the following fully and carefully:<br /><br />Silk Road Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki<br /><br />Silk Road Buyer&#039;s Guide:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide<br /><br />Silk Road Seller&#039;s Guide<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/sellers_guide<br /><br />Other tips:<br /><br />1) When entering bitcoin addresses COPY PASTE them instead of manually typing in that long address. Always triple check you have the right bitcoin address as your destination. <br /><br />2) Never store bitcoins for long periods of time (for example 1+ week) in TEMPORARY bitcoin address wallets such as Easywallet or Instawallet. These temporary wallets are mostly useful for moving funds around. If you want to store your bitcoins somewhere for a long period of time use your bitcoin software on your OS.<br /><br />3) Do not store ANY sensitive information in a Tormail account. All Tormail emails and draft emails are stored in plain-text on their servers, and you are placing your trust in a third party not to reveal your information the way hushmail.com did. Tormail have records of your username and password - all they are missing is your IP address. When sending mail with Tormail ALWAYS ensure that sensitive information is encrypted. <br /><br />4) Don&#039;t use empty houses or drop locations to receive packages. That kind of shit raises suspicions. Insist that the vendors use professionally PRINTED properly aligned labels with your address and name NEATLY placed. If you&#039;re ordering small personal amounts from trusted vendors using your home address is much that would be less risky than sending packages to an abandoned house. Postal workers know what to look for.&nbsp; Some people have reported success using names of previous tenants that lived / rented your place before.<br />Don&#039;t misspell or alter your name. You want your order to blend in with your other mail as much as possible. Your postal worker will notice a misspelled name; the first time they may shrug it off, but if the see it repeatedly they may suspect.<br /><br />5) PGP is highly important. Never underestimate encrypting sensitive info.<br /><br />Basic information about ESCROW, STATS AND FE:<br /><br />What&#039;s so very important for noobs to UNDERSTAND: <br /><br />Your BUYING STATS mean SO MUCH for your survival and quality of service you receive from SR.<br /><br />If you&#039;re coming on here to scam vendors for free shit, you&#039;re a shit and your stats will reflect that. <br /><br />Once you become part of SR, and you start purchasing your goodies, as a buyer you need to follow SR&#039;s ESCROW system. That way everyone including you can continue to enjoy SR without unnecessary bullshit.<br /><br />The Escrow system is simple and brilliant. <br />SR acts as the &quot;middle man&quot;, temporarily holds your money.. which means the vendor you are buying from doesn&#039;t receive your bitcoins UNTIL you have received your order. Once you receive your order you MUST click FINALIZE. Then SR releases your bitcoins to the vendor. <br />The escrow exists so both parties feel relatively safe and comfortable doing business with each other, preventing risk and satisfying both sides. <br />The vendor is putting his profits on hold until you receive your package and &#039;Finalize&#039; the transaction, so you are responsible to make sure he gets his deserved coins. Obviously this system guarantees the vendor ships your item. So being under the Escrow is the best thing for EVERYONE.<br /><br />The problem is a bunch of lowlifes decide to NOT finalize their orders, so these vendors are out of product and their money.<br />These kind of shitty buyers are causing more vendors to require FE before shipping to reduce their risk.<br /><br />You will see the word FE tossed around a lot. FE means Finalize Early. That means your vendor will get your money before shipping your product. The risk is all on your side in that case. That is why we all hate having to FE because of the risk ON US. A shithead vendor could decide NOT to ship your product(s) after you&#039;ve FE&#039;d.&nbsp; Technically he is fully paid and it all comes down to trusting the vendor&#039;s reputation. Some vendors require buyers with less than 5 successful transactions to FE. Most don&#039;t require FE. Or a vendor could request FE for an international order. All depends on the vendor, the listing and circumstances. <br /><br />grahamgreene: Buyers are NEVER required to FE. Finalizing Early is the choice of the buyer - it is important for new users to realize that they are NOT required to FE under any circumstances. If a vendor will not sell to them without FE, they can choose to use a vendor that does not require FE!!!<br /><br />The reason some vendors want FE is because of a few rotten shits that abuse the comfortable, rewarding Escrow System that really makes SR a satisfying stress-free place to do business.<br /><br />That is precisely why your STATS mean everything on SR. Once your stats show you are a reliable hassle-free buyer you can avoid FE. <br />Remember that vendors SCREEN AND VIEW your stats just like you screen their feedback / reviews.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a shitty buyer vendors will simply deny serving you or make you FE early. Maybe even give you SHITTY product. <br /><br />If you&#039;re a good buyer with good stats vendors will allow you to stay within escrow, and if you&#039;re lucky you might even get some special treatment / perks for being a reliable customer. So work on being a good buyer if you&#039;re happy with your goods / services received.<br /><br />So respect the Escrow system, that&#039;s there to CONSOLE / HELP YOU, respect SR&#039;s simple rules that were made for YOUR BENEFIT, and HONOR THE HARMONY.. so we can keep this thing going forever. So we can continue having honest transactions with vendors.<br /><br />Same exact principles applies to all vendors. <br />We have honorable vendors that work HARD to get their good feedback and reputation. They provide us with good quality gear and professional customer service. There are also few shitty vendors selling garbage or selective scam. The way our stats matter to vendors, their feedback and forum reviews immensely matter to us buyers.<br />We expect remarkable, premium quality product and top notch service. We set our standards high and most wonderful vendors can accommodate our refined cravings and experienced palettes with GOOD SHIT. Those vendors get the well deserved 5/5 feedback and have the forums buzzing like crazy spreading the word about their awesomeness.<br /><br />Lets say your order doesn&#039;t arrive or something went wrong, that is what the RESOLVE button is for. That will prompt a mini chat type interface between you and the vendor allowing some back-n-forth discussion regarding partial or full refunds, reships, or anything else that might remedy the problem. Good vendors truly care about their customers so before starting a thread bashing a vendor, message him/her first or go through the RESOLVE process to hopefully find a suitable solution.<br />Don&#039;t make a habit of asking for refunds unless it us truly genuinely necessary. REMEMBER: having too many refunds, or a reoccurring unusual pattern of buyer complaints will negatively affect your stats!<br /><br />SCAMMERS, ETC:<br />Here on SR try to be a special well-bred, noble breed of sophisticated drug user, defying all logic and stigma that the typical drug user has. we MUST maintain the MUTUAL RESPECT and courtesy between vendor and buyer, even btwn roader and roader.<br /><br />unfortunately there will always be pieces of shits trying to run cons and scam. whether it&#039;s on SR, or in the streets. in the streets at least we&#039;re able to toss fairly large sized bricks directly towards their chins / jaw, but here we have something else.<br /><br />This is very important to UNDERSTAND: scamming and any monkey business doesn&#039;t fly here. If you have any shitty intentions to scam on here I&#039;ll clearly explain why it simply is not WORTH IT:<br /><br />The vendors have their own private forum. In their forum they have a BLACKLIST of BANNED CUSTOMERS that ALL vendors see regularly and update it according to their interactions.<br />Once you&#039;re on this list you&#039;re fucked.<br />Any buyer on SR attempting to scam, score free drugs, or ANY other type of remotely shady / scummy bullshit act, will simply be ADDED and permanently LOGGED into this infamous BLACKLIST database of customers NEVER to deal with. But wait, not only your username will be posted but your NAME AND ADDRESS too!<br />To avoid re registering new nicks.. This is to truly keep these shameless, scoundrels recognized!<br /><br />One of our brilliant, more experienced superstar posters &#039; GRAHAMGREENE &#039; expanded, clarified and properly CORRECTED some of the info from my guide.&nbsp; PLEASE READ - THIS INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WILL GIVE YOUR DEEPER INSIGHT INTO SR&#039;S COMMUNITY:<br /><br />-It should be noted that Mt.Gox only freezes your account when you access it via TOR, but funds will be released once you verify your identity with them; it is possible to gain access to your funds in Mt.Gox, but you have to give up your anonymity to do so. If this happens, verify your identity, retrieve your Bitcoin, then tumble the fuck out of them in order to remove any links to the Bitcoin you bought on Mt.Gox and the Bitcoin you send to SR. There is nothing illegal about buying Bitcoin, but it is illegal to use them or any method of payment to buy illegal drugs.<br /><br />-blockchain, mtgox, instawallets, like all online wallets, can not be trusted 100%. There is no guarantee that they won&#039;t run off with your Bitcoin at any time. The safest place for your Bitcoin is in your Bitcoin client on your own computer, encrypted and backed up regularly.<br /><br />-Guides on how to do this on the Bitcoin wiki:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet<br /><br />-As E-Wallets use an internal transfer process, they do &#039;tumble&#039; or &#039;launder&#039; your Bitcoin in a sense, but it would not be prudent to rely on E-Wallets alone for tumbling purposes. <br /><br />Read more about anonymity and staying anonymous here:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity<br /><br />-It would also be prudent after hitting &quot;Get a new address&quot; in both your Bitcoin client and your SR account to check that address on blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info to ensure it has never been used on the network before. Though it is a statistical improbability, but possible.<br /><br />-If you want to store your Bitcoin somewhere for a long period of time NEVER use ANY E-Wallet. ALWAYS use your computer based client or a brainwallet.<br /><br />-Brainwallets Info here:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet<br />http://bitcoinmagazine.net/brain-wallets-the-what-and-the-how/<br /><br />Want to explain bit more about the Resolution and Auto-Finalization:<br /><br />-If your order has not arrived after about 13 days, hit the Resolve button. This will take your order to the Resolution Center. Here you will be given the option of asking the vendor for a refund, asking for a re-ship, extending the time-frame for your order to reach you or come to some other agreement with your vendor. Personally, I always extend by another 5 - 7 days because the postal service, whilst usually fairly efficient, does occasionally take longer than expected. If needs-be, I will extend again.<br /><br />-If a refund is requested and the amount of the refund is disputed by the vendor, the matter will be settled by SR dealing with the resolution. If the vendor has a specific refund policy, then you have agreed in advance. If the vendor can produce a proof that the item in question was sent, that backs up the vendor, SR will obviously side with them. However, the reputation of both the member and the vendor and their respective Purchasing / Selling stats will also weigh in on the administrator&#039;s decision.<br /><br />love, GRAHAMGREEN &amp; MRDOBOLINA

				This is pretty much what I did my first time buying bitcoins and it worked like a charm. Though the lady at the bank was a bit confused by my hand written transaction details&nbsp; ::) She figured it out pretty quick and I had my BTC like 7 minutes after I got home.<br />The only thing I did differently was I used a bitcoin client on my PC for the initial transaction. Next time it&#039;s going to be nothing but instawallets.<br />Personally I feel anonymous enough without laundering the BTC further than this.<br /><br />It&#039;s very easy to use a different bank or other location every time and just as easy to use new instawallets. If I were using larger amounts of BTC I might use a more permanent solution.<br />I can&#039;t imagine an easier way to do it. It cost me like 81.17 USD to get me 5.96 BTC. So, around 7 or 8 bucks in fees to trustcash and bitinstant<br /><br />As a SR noob I there was no way I was going to mail off some cash to a vendor I don&#039;t know in exchange for BTC. But some are trusting enough to FE, which I&#039;m not yet.

				First time I got my bitcoins I was like &quot;WOW THIS IS DAMN EASY!&quot; Great feeling it was arriving back from the bank to see the bitcoins in my blockchain wallet. I just walked into the bank, handed the paper to the teller, told her I&#039;m paying a bill.. and BOOM. I popped my bitcoin cherry so to speak. This was when I was in USA of course. <br />I also did the CVS / Moneygram thing but found the bank so much easier. <br />At CVS I had to pick up that germ infested, greasy Moneygram red phone and talk to the clueless operator. Then read her the numbers off the printed paper.. then I had to give the cash to a confused CVS cashier that didn&#039;t understand what he was doing. <br />The bank thing was in and out and felt so much more natural / easy.<br />Americans have it so easy with this guide. <br />From my experience the steps illustrated above is the easiest, safest way to go about the whole experience.

If this happens, verify your identity, retrieve your Bitcoin, then tumble the fuck out of them in order to remove any links to the Bitcoin you bought on Mt.Gox and the Bitcoin you send to SR. There is nothing illegal about buying Bitcoin, but it is illegal to use them or any method of payment to buy illegal drugs.<br /><br />blockchain.info, like all online wallets, can not be trusted 100%. There is no guarantee that they won&#039;t run off with your Bitcoin at any time. The safest place for your Bitcoin is in your Bitcoin client on your own computer, encrypted and backed up regularly. There are guides on how to do this on the Bitcoin wiki:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46294.msg490760#msg490760">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1) Go to www.instawallet.org and it will give you your own personal secret site with your own unique bitcoin address. make sure to bookmark this instawallet page because if you lose this link, you lose anything in it.<br />- Note: Make sure it&#039;s instawallet.ORG, with .org in the end.<br />- instawallet is a temporary piggy bank. each time you refresh the site you receive a unique randomized bitcoin address and a new secret link.<br />- we are using instawallet to move our bitcoins around, obscuring and fogging up the footprints. that is laundering or &quot;washing&quot; bitcoins.<br /><br />[snip]<br /><br />3) Now open up a another Instawallet page, which will give you another unique bitcoin address.

Not necessary, but advisable.<br />BitcoinFog is not a free service:<br />The service takes 1%-3% (randomized for obscurity) fee on each deposit.<br />No other fees are in place, no complex calculations based on the number of withdraws or similar.<br />Minimum withdraw amount is 1.00 BTC.<br /><br />The method to use BitcoinFog securely is below, taken directly from their clearnet website (www.bitcoinfog.com):<br />After a couple of network confirmations, your money is registered on your Fog account, and you can schedule withdrawals. Each withdrawal will be split in a random number of payouts, depending on the amount, and the relative size of each payout will be randomized as well. Even the timing of those payouts will be randomly spread out over a period of time you will specify.<br /><br />Ideally you should deposit an amount of bitcoins to the Fog, wait some time (which will depend on how many users are using the service, right now in the starting phase we recommend a week) and request a withdrawal, which will not have the same amount as the original deposit, leaving some funds in the Fog.<br /><br />Then you should deposit another batch of bitcoins and withdraw yet another amount, again different from the amount you have deposited. This time it can be lower than deposited, or higher, adding the funds you have left from the previous deposit. This way there is no practically reliable way to do statistical analysis on the block chain and link your deposits to your withdrawals.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46294.msg490760#msg490760">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Bonus useful tips:<br />1) When entering bitcoin addresses ALWAYS COPY PASTE them instead of manually typing in that long ass address. Always triple check you have the right bitcoin address as your destination.

What this exploit did was change the address on the clipboard once it had been copied, and when the user pasted the Bitcoin address into their client or E-Wallet, they were actually pasting the attacker&#039;s address. As you said, you should triple check you have the right address, but verify it visually with first, middle and last 4 digits before hitting the send button.<br />bitcoin-qt, the computer based client, doesn&#039;t allow you to send to an address shorter than 34 characters - I&#039;m unsure if E-Wallets do the same, but I would assume so as transfers can&#039;t be sent to an address shorter than 34 characters, unless you input 4 or 5 characters of a first-bit address.<br /><br />It would also be prudent after hitting &quot;Get a new address&quot; in both your Bitcoin client and your SR account to check that address on blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info to ensure it has never been used on the network before. Though it is a statistical improbability, that very thing actually happened to me when I set up a new receiving address in my client. For some reason I checked the address before I bought my Bitcoin and noticed that it had been used 2 years ago - before I&#039;d even heard of Bitcoin.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46294.msg490760#msg490760">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2) Never store bitcoins for long periods of time (for example more than 1 week) in TEMPORARY bitcoin address wallets such as Easywallet or Instawallet.

ALWAYS use your computer based client or a brainwallet.<br /><br />Read about brainwallets here:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet<br />http://bitcoinmagazine.net/brain-wallets-the-what-and-the-how/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46294.msg490760#msg490760">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3) Instead of saving all your login / password or bitcoin addresses, etc or all other SR related info in some notepad or text document on your harddrive, register for a TORMAIL account and keep all your links, passwords, and sensitive information in your Drafts section there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do not store ANY sensitive information in a Tormail account. All Tormail emails and draft emails are stored in plain-text on their servers, and you are placing your trust in a third party not to reveal your information the way hushmail.com did. Tormail have records of your username and password - all they are missing is your IP address. When sending mail with Tormail ALWAYS ensure that sensitive information is encrypted. Again, just as with SR, do NOT trust the system.<br />The best place to store your information is in your head. If you can&#039;t do that, store them in a double or triple encrypted file on a memory stick or SD card. I won&#039;t go into encryption here but search the forums and you&#039;ll find all the information you need to run a secure setup.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46294.msg490760#msg490760">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4) Don&#039;t use empty houses or drop locations to receive packages. That kind of shit raises suspicions. Insist that the vendors use professionally printed&nbsp; properly aligned labels with your address and name in all CAPS. If you&#039;re ordering small personal use amounts from trusted vendors using your home address is much less risky than sending packages to an abandoned house. Postal workers know what to look for with these tricks. You can use your name slightly misspelled or altered. Some people have reported success using names of previous tenants that lived / rented your place before.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I personally have never received any mail with my name and address in capital letters - others may have, so my word on this point should not be taken as gospel, but I would imagine that most business mail is sent with the customer&#039;s name and address in lowercase, with capitalisation only used in the necessary places. Some postal services did recommend in the past that details be in caps so as the machine could read it more easily, but with the advent of modern scanning technology this is no longer a necessity, and I believe it would make the letter / package stand out amongst your other mail.<br /><br />Never misspell or alter your name. You want your order to blend in with your other mail as much as possible. Your mailman or mailwoman will notice a misspelled name; the first time they may shrug it off, but if the see it repeatedly they may think something is up.<br />Put it this way: if you were ordering something from the likes of Amazon or ebay, wouldn&#039;t you be sure to spell your name correctly? Your mail has to look like any other online purchase. Some people try to combine a misspelled name with a &quot;someone&#039;s trying to frame me&quot; excuse. If someone were trying to frame you with drugs that they likely spent money on, it&#039;ll be someone that has a vendetta against you. You can be damn sure they&#039;ll Facebook or Google you to ensure they spell your name correctly so the &quot;Look, they spelled my name wrong, I&#039;m being framed!&quot; excuse goes out the window.<br /><br />Using the name of a previous tenant is risky as they may have set up mail forwarding. Some people still receive mail for previous tenants, but mail forwarding doesn&#039;t always forward all mail (junkmail etc. is often still sent to the tenant&#039;s previous address.) By doing this, you risk your purchase being forwarded to the ex-tenant.<br />Best case scenario: they use drugs and think it&#039;s awesome that someone sent them a freebie.<br />Worst case scenario: they receive a package of drugs or white powder in the mail and immediately call the police who see your address on the package as it was forwarded, thereby putting your address on their radar.<br /><br />ALWAYS use your real name and real address for orders. Some have had success with P.O. boxes opened up with fake ID&#039;s. I have no experience with that though so I can&#039;t comment on it - again, a search of the forums will throw up threads with the necessary information.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46294.msg490760#msg490760">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lets say your order doesn&#039;t arrive or something went wrong, that is what the RESOLVE button is for. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just wanted to add a bit here about Resolution and Auto-Finalization:<br /><br />If your order has not arrived after about 13 days, hit the Resolve button. This will take your order to the Resolution Center, as orngecapsule has already outlined. Here you will be given the option of asking the vendor for a refund, asking for a re-ship, extending the time-frame for your order to reach you or come to some other agreement with your vendor. Personally, I always extend by another 5 - 7 days because the postal service, whilst usually fairly efficient, does occasionally take longer than expected. If needs-be, I will extend again.<br /><br />The initial time extension begins at the end of the 17 day period (when your vendor marks your order as &#039;in transit&#039;, it will be 17 days before the order auto-finalizes) so if you enter resolution on day 13 and offer a 7 day extension, it will be 11 days (the 4 days left out of the 17 day period, plus the 7 days you&#039;re extending by) before it comes the attention of Resolution Center administrators again. You can ask to change the terms of resolution at any time, and you can also Finalize at any time if your product has arrived and the Resolution process will automatically be closed.<br /><br />Always enter Resolution a couple of days before the auto-finalization date. One of the things vendors hate most is expecting their money after the 17 day period, only for the buyer to enter resolution and propose an extension 2 hours before auto-finalization. If you haven&#039;t logged in for a few days and it IS a couple of hours before finalization, hit &#039;resolve&#039; and explain in the note section that you hadn&#039;t logged in, apologize for entering resolution so close to the auto-finalization date and propose a time extension. Once an order is in the resolution center it will not auto-finalize.<br /><br />If a % refund is requested and the amount of the refund is disputed by the vendor, the matter will be settled by the administrator dealing with the resolution. If the vendor has a specific refund policy, then you have agreed to that upon ordering and that is the refund that you will receive, if any. If the vendor can produce a DCN proving that the item in question was sent, then the proof backs up the vendor and SR will usually side with them. However, the reputation of both the member and the vendor and their respective Purchasing / Selling stats will also weigh in on the administrator&#039;s decision.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46294.msg490760#msg490760">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1) When you&#039;re required to FE, you&#039;re forced to leave feedback before receiving your product. Most people just write: &quot;FE, will update when arrives&quot; but they never actually update that feedback. Please take the time to update your feedback once you receive your items so others can read and learn from your experience. We hate seeing a vendor with all 5/5 feedback saying &quot;FE, will update later&quot; and no REVIEWS about the actual product.<br />To update your feedback, go to &#039;Account&#039; on SR and you&#039;ll see &#039;View Feedback&#039;. There you can modify / edit your feedback. Always think about the community and how to better serve us all.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On the topic of FE, if one does choose to Finalize Early they are not forced to leave feedback there and then. After clicking &#039;Finalize&#039;, they simply need to click on any link to take them away from item feedback page, and they can then leave their feedback when they receive their item. This prevents a load of &quot;FE, will update when received&quot; etc. feedbacks on the vendor&#039;s page.<br /><br /><br />Other than that, the only things I can recommend new members to do is read the following fully and carefully:<br /><br />Silk Road Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki<br /><br />Silk Road Buyer&#039;s Guide:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide<br /><br />Silk Road Seller&#039;s Guide (in order to give you a better understanding of how the whole process works):<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/sellers_guide<br /><br />Thanks for taking the advice on board and amending your post, orngecapsule! Some people would take such a request the wrong way; feel free to PM me your SR username or provide me with a Bitcoin address so as I can send you a little something for taking the time out to write up something so helpful for new members of this community.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				EDIT: VERY URGENT INFO: There have been very troubling recent reports regarding Instawallet scamming. I did not investigate the whole situation but for now, until these UNFORTUNATE Instawallet scamming incidents can be resolved / confirmed you can simply use Easywallet or any other reputable, well known, trustworthy temporary wallet services to mix your coins. Search the forums for alternatives to Instawallet until this whole recent scamming rumors have been confirmed.

				Just wanted to update the allegations towards instawallet:<br /><br />There was simply a glitch in their system and if any person attempted to use their services and had a problem, please just e-mail their tech support.<br /><br />Using instawallet was and still is an option.<br /><br />I do appreciate MRDOBOLINA warning people though, as it was his guide that led me to use instawallet. Your guide was very helpful and remains valid, thank you.

				Thanks so much for the play by play, I&#039;m new and am using this guide. It&#039;s great help but i&#039;m stuck with bit instant. I can&#039;t get it to display pay from and pay to, or any of the address info. <br />Im also, for the first time, getting a yellow bar on the bottom of my screen about scripts forbidden? never happened before just curious what it means.<br />Also, What happens when you &quot;allow scripts Globally (dangerous)?&quot; Does it comprimise annonymity? I havnt done it just curious.<br />If anyone has advice about bitinstant it would be VERRRRYYYY appreciated!<br />Thanks

				Thanks for the NOOB guide! I clicked on Walmart since the bank deposit isn&#039;t available any longer but they ask for a phone number before you can print the page.&nbsp; I think it would be sufficient to pick up a cheap $15 prepaid phone since these don&#039;t require any info when activating the phone (at least Verizon doesn&#039;t), but I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s any way to track them for the ultra paranoid? Anyone know?

				I have had great success using BitInstant via Moneygram.&nbsp; In fact, this morning, I made a BitInstant cash deposit at WalMart.&nbsp; Used all fake info, disposable email, disposable wallet, and handed the teller the cash.&nbsp; She put in the information, it said processing/authorizing for about a minute, and &quot;LITERALLY&quot; the minute the drawer opened for my change, my phone buzzed and the transaction was executed.&nbsp; Again, I hadn&#039;t even received the nickel of change back before the BTC transaction was executed.&nbsp; So well done BitInstant.<br /><br />Of course, as has been mentioned, being quick about getting your coins means a tradeoff of anonymity.&nbsp; The safest thing to do is tumble them for a sufficiently long time.&nbsp; <br /><br />But, is it really a big deal if your entire BitInstant transaction was done using fake credentials, and at WalMart where the employees don&#039;t care who you are?&nbsp; And for a relatively small amount of illegal stuff?&nbsp; I feel like as long as your personal identity isn&#039;t linked to the transaction (ie. cash from a fake name), then doing BitInstant to wallet to SR shouldn&#039;t be a problem, no?

				I&#039;m having problems with BitInstant after it takes me to the cashpayment site. I fill out all the info but it never lets me click &quot;create payment slip.&quot; I&#039;ve tried Moneygram, Walmart, CVS, and Albertsons; various e-mail addresses and amounts and I&#039;ve even changed my bitcoin address. Is anyone else having this problem? <br /><br />Edit: Cashpayment doesn&#039;t accept Mailinator addresses anymore apparently. It kept highlighting my mailinator address in red but when I punched in a fake yahoo address it worked fine.
