				First off I am not a complete newb, i just re-registered cause i was dumb when i first started and used the same username on SR.<br /><br />For whatever reason the last three or four days it takes hours to finally connect to The SR log in page. WTF<br />I can go anywhere else no problem (like here for example). I m using linux liberte and dont know if thats the problem or what. Has anyone else had any issues recently. I neeed to access my account to take care of some business that ive already started. i dont want to be MIA and piss somebody off.

				This happened to me yesterday too. Just wouldn&#039;t connect to SR at all (kept giving me a 503 error). Other onion sites and clearnet worked fine though.<br /><br />I fired up the TOR bundle on another PC at the same time and it connected to SR straightaway.<br /><br />Restarting Liberte fixed the problem though.<br /><br />Weird.

				I usually have some connection issue with Liberte (on USB), from a laptop.<br /><br />At Spot #1 - using an actual ethernet cable/connection (also another comp on this network - DSL). I would get constant long loading times just to have them fail, keep refreshing, then BAM randomly it would connect and I&#039;d be golden.<br /><br />At Spot #2 - wireless connection (some other comps - Cable). Almost always connects to SR first time, and fast.<br /><br />In general, when it boots I disable whichever connection I&#039;m not using, load up main SR bookmark, a category/vendor bookmark, and forum bookmark. Will stop and retry or refresh every 45-90 seconds. Sometimes manually switch TOR identities (but I don&#039;t think that actually does much in this case, more of a placebo than anything. Usually any other Tor site works well, but haven&#039;t been paying much attention to correlate it.

				I have also been having trouble getting on SR through liberte. I have to use the unsafe browser, log into my network and then get on the safe browser and click on one of the home page links, hope it loads then put in SR. It&#039;s very weird. And liberte won&#039;t just shut down when I logout. I have to force it to shut down with the button.<br /><br />Liberte seems worse than tails regarding internet connectivity. I just can&#039;t find a great tutorial on burning a new disk to install tails. Somehow I was running tails, the new update happened and I couldn&#039;t get a new version disk to work.<br /><br />I really like that tails deleted everything and it shut down like it should. So if anyone has a great tails installation tutorial, I&#039;d love to see it. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s easy I just don&#039;t know what I&#039;m doing wrong.
