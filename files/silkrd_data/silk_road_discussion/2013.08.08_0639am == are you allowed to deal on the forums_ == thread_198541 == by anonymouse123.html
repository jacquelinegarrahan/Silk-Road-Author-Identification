				To be perfectly clear, RxKing was being sarcastic about everything except the PGP part. Vending on the forums is not allowed! Especially for you because last I heard, you were trying to scam a vendor I think.

				Wait, during some outages there were several vendors selling on the forums. <br />I know it&#039;s probably not allowed for anyone to do it, but if you are a vendor on SR and have the Vendor Status beside your name (which I believe requires you to have a forum signature to your SR profile) I believe you can vend on the forums. This might just be during certain times or circumstances, but i know if you visit Product Offers I have seen a few thread where people &quot;buy&quot; direct. I can&#039;t guarantee anything was legit, but as far as being allowed I&#039;m not sure why you couldn&#039;t as long as you are a vendor.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				Not saying that I&#039;d do it, just that I&#039;ve seen it done and I have actually made a purchase from a vendor (that I had done business with before) through the forums. This was several months back (a year?) but during the outage I saw the forums filled with mostly high rated vendors offering their products during the blackout. Not sure, but i think these were unplanned or very long.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But what you said about vending outside of SR - anywhere you can point me to that? I know you can&#039;t do SR transactions outside of SR, but what&#039;s stopping me (Vendor Rule Wise) from using a BTC merchant API to make a .onion webstore? Wouldn&#039;t that also mean I could lose my account for having a BMR account?

And if they message you in the forums trying to do business then you direct them to your SR page.<br /><br />Also there is a vendor support button at the bottom of your page, use that, and ask them what you are asking in here.

				Placing a ling from BMR can give you problems. You can bet on it if the link is yours.<br />But alking about someone just of a&nbsp; name the name on BMR&nbsp; is feedom of speech. DPR i anarchist-enough, left oriented western values in SR. They just want dfreedom. amoney is coming like it&#039;s raining cats and dogs. Torrent of money. DPR will do nothing. It is against her principles to deside what is seen and what not.<br />A freedomfighter from a universal leavel DPR is a she, and should leave no info on her side about her profile. The point she likes books helps L.E. t narrow her down. My guess is that they want her head, To get SR fom internet is useless, because there be several moresites like SR and everbody will switch.

				I don&#039;t personally use BMR or any other market, I&#039;m just curious since I&#039;ve seen it on several vendor pages and in signatures.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The wiki is quite brief, I&#039;m not saying that I&#039;m going around advertising it, and I&#039;m not saying OP should vend on here before (or that that&#039;s even allowed).<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen vendors advertise on Forums when SR is down, I&#039;ve seen several cvendors with websites (not stores), and many that have links to alternate markets on their signatures and often profiles.<br /><br />Sorry if I have offended anyone, but honestly the wiki is very brief. Farmer1 post cleared it up.<br /><br />I don&#039;t vend on the forums or on any other marketplace, but I do offer TOR hidden services which are quite hard to detail if I can&#039;t list a URL other than SR related. <br /><br />

You will have only the best SR has to offer you sending you their address for free drugs. And as soon as you make $500 and you get a vendor account, those same people you sent free drugs too will become buyers for you.<br /><br />Also they will give you great reviews.<br /><br />I am glad you wrote this post so that others know. As there is no information on what you asked anywhere in this forums. And everyone knows the search option does not work. Every time you go to use it, it will tell you that someone else just searched for that very same thing and you have to wait 5 seconds.<br /><br />Good luck to you and welcome to SR forum vending. <br /><br />Ps. Make sure that when you send out free samples, that the people sending you their address use pgp. If they do not, your fucked and so are they.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My hero! lol just kidding i dont know you but thanks for the info :)
