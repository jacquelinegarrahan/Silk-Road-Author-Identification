				So i have brown sand and xtc express&#039;s pressed pills and I&#039;m having trouble finding a solid base of people to give product to. I&#039;ve only been able to hand out to maybe 10 different people in total, maybe 4 or 5 of which who are re-occurring. The first two orders I made moved within a week, but only to about 5 people, and their friends. How do I expand my base? How can I go out and find more people who would want some of this. The area I&#039;m from has very crappy molly, so getting this pure stuff is a breathe of fresh air for everyone. Raves/Events have under covers everywhere, so it&#039;s risky to walk up to people and ask them if they want any. I go to university, but also walking up to people asking if they want molly would be awkward. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m doing something wrong.. Yes, giving out within my group of friends is safer, but I want to dip into their groups of friends because I don&#039;t know many people who are down to do/try mdma out. Can anyone give some tips? Any advice, new ideas, suggestions, etc.. to help me get the ball rolling a bit more? <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen people say &quot;craigslist&quot; but thats a little sketchy for me. Doesn&#039;t seem reliable.<br /><br />Thank you!

				I would recommend to continue doing what you&#039;re doing and take it slowly.&nbsp; That is the only way to ensure you can trust the people you deal with.<br /><br />The more people you meet who start dealing with who you can&#039;t trust the quicker you are going to get caught up in some bullshit.<br /><br />Maybe some of your friends would be interested in helping you sell some to their friends for a cut.<br /><br />Other than that, just try to make some more friends.&nbsp; Maybe hang out at some more parties just to meet people and then talk to them about your gear after you know them.

				Socialize more dont give away any free product.<br />Don&#039;t eat up your stash. Charge for a dose, wait til next week friend will be back with another, within a month you will have more than you can supply.<br /><br />Find 1-2 friends that want to make money, let them become the builders of network you become main head and supply friends it will grow you need to be patient and network with popular friends, if near a college find frat houses, hippies and bar hoppers...these are target markets.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad<br />

				Take it slow, if you have a good product the market will come to you. I know it can be hard to be patient but it&#039;ll be worth it in the end&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Also, since you said your area has crappy molly, get a test kit and show everyone they are getting methylone (if your market is similar to mine ha) then show that your shit is legit. Customers will flock to you haha good luck and stay safe dude.<br /><br />Z<br /><br />

				If you&#039;re in the states, you shouldn&#039;t have any problem at all selling real mdma.&nbsp; Your client base can get as large as you want it to when you&#039;re the only dude (or dudette) with real ecstasy around.<br /><br />You said you&#039;ve gotten it out to 10 different people, and half come back.&nbsp; 50% is pretty good lol.&nbsp; Either ask those people that you already know to help refer you, or offer a referral incentive if you want (doesn&#039;t have to be big).<br /><br />Just talk to people.&nbsp; The more people you talk to, the more you&#039;ll sell.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t feel safe talking to people, you could tell them your friend has some and don&#039;t keep any on you when you talk to others.&nbsp; Just keep a delicate balance of clients and safety.

Now I move 7oz a month, and I can&#039;t order it fast enough. Look at how cheap molly is here..You can get 100 grams for under 20/gram. Sell to a few people in ounces, not grams. I am not greedy and I get my product out for about $1100/oz, or $39/gram..doubling my money, for what? Taking a risk? It&#039;s too easy. I sell to my friends (Usually at 1oz or more at a time) who EASILY get $60-70/gram at an ounce level to guys who are slinging grams for at least $80. I love that they are making money, and I love that I am making money without having to actually TRY to sell it. I am not the guy who talks to everyone at the club, but my friends are. They meet people who are cool and get my stuff out there. Be the wholesaler, the guy in the background.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have friends who are social, just go to the club and make friends. Once you start talking to people who don&#039;t seem sketchy, casually drop that you have molly if they need it. Pray they are someone, or know someone, who needs a lot. Again..Don&#039;t be greedy. $40/gram in my market is *incredible* for pure MDMA. People are so used to Methylone/bk-mdma/M1/whatever you wanna call it, that they take my stuff and it *floors* them.<br /><br />tl;dr: Don&#039;t be cheap, don&#039;t be a dick, be aware of your opportunities. Make money, go to festivals, be happy.

But, they do know people who would buy weed daily but since coke has a bigger mark-up, they think it&#039;s better to go with that.<br /><br />Sit down, run numbers and think about everything before you dive into business.<br /><br />Because drug dealing is a business.

				@Uknown79<br /><br />You actually give me hope! lol<br />What you did sounds perfect actually. $60/gram here would be a steal too. I&#039;ll sell what I can from whatever I have left and start off small again. Who do you order from, if you don&#039;t mind me asking. I like xtc express&#039;s pressed but his powder gets odd reviews. How were you selling the 10grams? per gram or each individual cap? I like the way you ran your business.<br /><br />@Slicksuit<br /><br />Yeah, I realized that afterwards. But also, I asked around and I do know about 20 or so people who do pop, but they don&#039;t do it on a constant basis, which is the only problem when it comes to moving product. Of course, I know a lot more people who smoke weed, almost everyone I know does, but I feel like weed would be riskier. Takes up more space, smells, I don&#039;t smoke weed myself so I&#039;m not sure what the prices and what not are. Kinda sucks.

I know plenty of people that sell green and end up smoking half of their profit, hell some of them only deal so they can smoke their whole profit - sounds stupid to me, but to each their own. <br /><br />It&#039;s like coke dealers to, I know a couple of people that used to move keys of the stuff, and they would probably snort through 2-3 grams daily for months just because it was always around - it&#039;s not good for your health either.<br /><br />I know where your coming from about not knowing anyone who does Molly often -&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t deal small quantities in real life because I wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable selling a gram or two to the same people every week because of the chance they were fucking their head up. IRL I strictly stick to bulk and let other people worry about a guilty conscious.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want help running number, or making a business plan or anything - I can give you a little when I have time&nbsp; :)

				As others have said, find someone who will do all the low level dealing for you. When I started out I let friends know and let them know they can tell their friends who might be interested but didn&#039;t really push anyone about it. Ended up selling small amounts (1-50 capsules / 1-3 grams) to a few friends and then met a friend of a friend who I almost exclusively sell to now and he buys 2-3 oz a month. Through the same guy I&#039;m now branching out now and will possibly be selling a QP - 1/2 lb of bud a week to someone he knows. Personally I make everyone I&#039;ve sold through create a chain of people to limit my exposure so all the friends of friends who tried my mdma never have met me, nor will the guy buying a QP - 1/2lb of bud. This way rather than 50 people knowing that I deal only 5 will. Don&#039;t be afraid to go slow, you&#039;re better off making little/no money than being locked up.<br /><br /><br />Buy bulk, sell bulk.<br />Give a discount on bulk amounts, if you&#039;re selling in the US you should already have a fat profit margin.<br />Don&#039;t sell shit product, your reputation will carry you.<br />If you&#039;re out of product and won&#039;t be getting any for 2 weeks don&#039;t string your people along saying you&#039;ll have it every other day. That pisses people off.<br />Don&#039;t be a stranger to the game.<br /><br />The federal mandatory 5 year sentence for mdma possession is 200 grams, stay under this.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53177.0#msg522023<br />hXXp://famm.org/federal/UnderstandingFederalSentencingLaws.aspx

Ended up selling small amounts (1-50 capsules / 1-3 grams) to a few friends and then met a friend of a friend who I almost exclusively sell to now and he buys 2-3 oz a month. Through the same guy I&#039;m now branching out now and will possibly be selling a QP - 1/2 lb of bud a week to someone he knows. Personally I make everyone I&#039;ve sold through create a chain of people to limit my exposure so all the friends of friends who tried my mdma never have met me, nor will the guy buying a QP - 1/2lb of bud. This way rather than 50 people knowing that I deal only 5 will. Don&#039;t be afraid to go slow, you&#039;re better off making little/no money than being locked up.<br /><br /><br />Buy bulk, sell bulk.<br />Give a discount on bulk amounts, if you&#039;re selling in the US you should already have a fat profit margin.<br />Don&#039;t sell shit product, your reputation will carry you.<br />If you&#039;re out of product and won&#039;t be getting any for 2 weeks don&#039;t string your people along saying you&#039;ll have it every other day. That pisses people off.<br />Don&#039;t be a stranger to the game.<br /><br />The federal mandatory 5 year sentence for mdma possession is 200 grams, stay under this.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53177.0#msg522023<br />hXXp://famm.org/federal/UnderstandingFederalSentencingLaws.aspx<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Only problem is, especially when working with friends of friends and so on (people who aren&#039;t super loyal to you) - if one of them is caught, they will likely snitch on you. <br /><br />Best suggestion is to keep your name and face out of the game, and to pay someone who you know you can fully trust, a considerable amount of cash to do meets/bulk deals for you, and act like they are the people supplying. <br /><br />You gotta&#039; remember all it takes is for you to be seen with someone who the LE are watching once for them to start taking a closer look at you. <br /><br />But, I agree - bulk dealing is the way to go. Way easier to shift one key, than it is 100 individual grams.

				That&#039;s the harder part to do though, isn&#039;t it? Not many people can start off dealing bulk like that haha. It&#039;s the build up that seems to be harder. Once you have a strong base from doing the smaller deals, you find the people who buy a lot for friends or use a lot for parties/raves, sell bulk to them and let them sell or use it however they want... I have the right idea?

				If you are going to handle bulk and larger quantities outside of your inner circle, seek out connects through the people you sell to or associate with. They all know dealers. But really, just go slow and stay within your circle. It doesn&#039;t really matter how many layers you create, once an investigation starts, they&#039;re going to get you. How much they can get you with if something goes wrong is up to you as long as you are meticulous. Networking is not hard - it only seems impossible or hard when you&#039;re doing it in your head, beforehand. But once you are ready to go, the word will get out and it will sell itself, trust me. The most important thing is knowing your limits and having an exit strategy because there are three ways out - dead, jail, or while you&#039;re ahead. Can you make it where others have failed? Sure. But the numbers don&#039;t really lie and we all think we&#039;re different.

				This is mainly a guide on dealing in general, but whatever.<br /><br />People mainly take MDMA at EDM/Bass Music centric shows. Make friends (don&#039;t sell) at THESE places, and go from there. Once you&#039;ve made the customer base you won&#039;t need to frequent these locations/scenes for drug related business, reducing risk dramatically. Be discrete and prove you have the best product (reagent tests, etc.) and you will be successful. Don&#039;t brag and let your reputation speak for itself. <br /><br />Use a burner cell phone purchased and activated from a very different area code than the area you sell in, and change the entire phone itself (including the number AND area code) often. Remember to always use cash to buy the phones, and from different locations every single time. Only allow a few VERY close people access to that phone number, have them save the number as something inconspicuous in their cell phones, if they save it at all. Don&#039;t buy the phone if it requires ANY personal information. No text messaging to your burner phone, only calls, unless the text is completely non incriminating. No texting about meeting times or anything, the less texting the better. If you establish hours of operation texting becomes not necessary.<br /><br />For your normal phone, NO more drug talk, AT ALL. If you&#039;re gonna deal you gotta be safe. Only allow people to buy form you through the people who you have trusted enough to given your burner phone number, and have THEM do it, have THEM middle man it so you NEVER have to meet a new customer without a lot of vouches from current, trusted customers.<br /><br />To do this, you gotta stay on top of your shit, especially the phone. Customers hate unreliability, you gotta eliminate that.

				Honestly, ive never had a problem finding a customer base for when i decide to sell! ...<br /><br />Most of my stock is sold before it arrives becaue thanks to SR my customers all know the quality is superb - so i do become their number one choice!<br /><br />Other than that, people often when im out and about if i have anything to sell at raves.. i make a fair bit there, but i never carry more than 10 pills at a time when i go out..<br /><br />

Place was crazy packed, and they had at least 30 security / police watching over the crowd, not to mention the 10 or so undercovers.

				Good good call. There are some clubs that don&#039;t let you back out once you&#039;re in, unless you&#039;re leaving for the night. They&#039;re getting slightly smarter but yeah, seems like most of these places are meant for networking more-so than selling. which kinda sucks now. <br />Pisses me off, this girl that &quot;really wants to try my stuff&quot; recently told me she&#039;s scared to try it.. so fucking stupid .

				God damn, you&#039;re a blessing man.<br />Yeah, his presses are definitely expensive compared to powder. I like the non messy fuss of it. But yeah, I have to sell nades (170-180mg) for $20 vs the brown sand (120mg) I have for 10$.&nbsp; There&#039;s slim to non profit on the pressed pills if they&#039;re sold at $10. Thankfully they sell themselves. One of my friends told me a blackberry (150mg-160mg) hit him like 0.5g of the shit he was getting before. $20 for 1 pill vs. $50 for half gram, still saving money. But yeah... if XTCExpress&#039;s powder is the same as what&#039;s in his pressed pills, I&#039;ll buy powder eventually.

				Yup! Around here (Somewhere in Canada), street price is about $10 a cap (which is what I push brown sand for). Only diference is the $10 shit you find on the street is usually buffed with something else, because the dealers here are in it for the money. I&#039;m not. Well I kinda do it for the money too, but I want people to experience what REAL molly is. I put a little less in the cap, but it has people coming back, especially for $10 a roll. I charge $20 for the grenades, but I don&#039;t mention it unless they&#039;ve bought the brown sand from me before. I&#039;ve always had a nice long lasting high from the xtc express nades, so if they feel the brown sand doesn&#039;t last long enough (quite a few have told me this) then I offer them the nades. I tell them wait a week between rolls, then it&#039;ll be a better high and it&#039;ll last about 3-4 hours solid. A gram of the cut stuff, about $60-$70 from what my friend was telling me before he started buying off me. If i wanted to, I could sell per gram, but i don&#039;t. I know the quality of what&#039;s out there on the street and I know what I have. $10 for brown sand is discount enough, I feel.

				I put about 120-130mg in each. <br /><br />It&#039;s funny; I was talking to one of my russian mid-level friends and he was telling me how he has killer mdma and what not. So I gave him a 120mg sample of my stash and asked him to get one of his guys to try it. A couple days later , he comes back to me and says his guy said it was &quot;alright&quot; / nothing special. I was kinda confused, because this is LL&#039;s stuff, it&#039;s rock solid mdma, how the fuck is he getting his hands on something way better? A week later, I ask him how much he puts in his caps and he&#039;s throwing 300mg of shit in there. No wonder why his guy thought it was &quot;okay&quot;, my shit had less than half the dose lol.<br /><br />Yeah I&#039;ve seen MIMM&#039;s stuff. Looks similar but unless he buys from Lucianno and resells in smaller amounts, I&#039;d assume it&#039;s different.

At this dose, a lot of the time people have who have &quot;rolled&quot; (likely off bunk or bk-mdma) many times but never taken MDMA are floored by the drug. &quot;Too intense&quot; is one of the comments I&#039;ve heard, especially from smaller girls. I would guess that less than 40% of people &quot;rolling&quot; in a club in my area have never had MDMA.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get into beans/pills/rolls/ecstasy.
