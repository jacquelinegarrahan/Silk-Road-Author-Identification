				Will you take a look at the pin lock out rule, if you forget it, currently you wait 72 hours before you can reset it?<br /><br />What difference does it make if its 24 hours, 48 hours or 72 hours, if this happens with online banking its a matter of hours before your back on track.<br /><br />72 hours is far to long, 24 hours is cool, I mean thinking about things logically, what does this actually achieve if I have hacked an account other than giving the user of the hacked account more time to log inn and and realize their error but it still gets locked, as long as its locked and changed is all that matters!

				What it is actually doing is giving the REAL owner more time to get to his account!!!!!<br /><br /><br />If it was 24hrs lets say...then someone could hack your account...not the hardest thing...then they would put the wrong pin in...and boom in 24 hours they would have your money! Where as with 72 hours.....if you get hacked....it gives you time to get to your account and get back in it.<br /><br />And the truth is that very few people forget their pin! And the real people that do...are usually people that have been inactive for a while or are way to high and totally fucked up. <br /><br />And the other people that &quot;forget&quot; their pin...and this is a very small group...are people that hacked the account...it might not be a stranger per say...but a roommate or a partner...whatever..the point it that they are the group the 72 hours works against!! And when you look at it that way....72 hours is perfect. It sucks when you are a person that forgot it but it is a life saver for someone that got hacked!<br /><br />

				I was thinking that too but surly as long as its actually changed straight away and you ask a number of security questions it shouldnt make to much of a difference, but I hear you.<br /><br />Actually theres something we could change, ask security questions, we dont really have any on here, for obvious reasons of course, but it would be good if we had a second password that you could confirm if your account got hacked, only you would know it, thats assuming you remembered it lol.<br /><br />The thing is I actually remember my pin now, damm it! At the time I was very tired and it just completely went out of my mind, then came back today, funny thing the human mind. :(<br /><br />Not going to worry though, guess it wasnt ment to be, these things happen, I will just stick to smoking my boring stash old stash bits for now.

And 99.99999 never write down and never forget their pin. Sucks that you remember it now..<br /><br />

				before the PIN, people had their accounts drained all the time, then we made you wait a week and incidents of theft went to near zero.&nbsp; 72 hours is a good compromise I think.&nbsp; don&#039;t forget your PIN!
