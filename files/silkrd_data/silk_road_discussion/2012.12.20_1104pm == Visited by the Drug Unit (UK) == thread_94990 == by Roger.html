				They said a package had been intercepted containing a significant number of powders (MDMA was mentioned) and it had my address on it. They also mentioned that a vendor had been arrested. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t order various powders, I ordered 1g of MDMA, from TheCookieJahMan, which I received the day before. It wasn&#039;t stealthily packaged, just a baggie taped to a card, with a handwritten note saying &#039;Hope you enjoy the surprise&#039;... a message which confused me at the time and still does. Nevertheless it contained quality class A drugs. This seller was new but was attracting glowing reviews, he was up to about 30 transactions on 100% when I ordered.<br /><br />Whatever happened that led the police to my door, I don&#039;t know. Most likely I think the seller was busted and my address found at the premises, leading the police to wonder if I had any significant role in this. Going on what the police said, I&#039;m supposed to believe this seller had some sort of lapse and sent me a huge bag of drugs I didn&#039;t order. I see that as less likely. Whatever happened, there has been a serious security breach here.<br /><br />The cops were reasonable and I knew it was more likely to end there and then if I just told the truth. I was confident there was very little they could charge me with (or could be bothered to charge me with) so I admitted buying the gram and told them where from, educated them somewhat, as they looked on with genuine interest. I reasoned if I denied having anything in the house they could come back and turn the place over so I surrendered the gram. To his credit the PC saw I was respectable and cooperative and agreed to overlook it, so that went down the toilet and they were on their way. No charges, but this will be noted on some record somewhere, won&#039;t it?<br /><br />Does anyone have any other theories about what happened here?

				were they uniformed or did they just say they were police? did you see a warrant card? The police dont call themselves the &quot;drug unit&quot;.<br /><br />who was the seller? was the item posted locally to you? i.e. was the postmark London and you live in London?<br /><br />sounds pretty sketchy to me, not pleasant experience whether they were real police or not.

				To all people saying dont talk to the police etc you obviously dont know the UK police, ive heard officers call them the drug unit before, even to me explaining about what was going to happen. It just seems that they wanted to know what relation this address had to the other guy whos most likely been raided or has gotten himself in offline shit and just left the address lying about.<br /><br />If you actually co-operate with UK police they can sweep it under the carpet, many times ive had bits of coke or ket just taken from me and no further action taken purely because they have better shit to be getting on with, theyre not all like the USA police. Anyway they had no evidence you had any drugs, if you had said not they more than likely probally would have come back at a later state, maybe with a search warrant so it was probably sensible to give it up. It wont go on your record no, it may be noted that you where paid a visit but its not like they are going to note down that they just confiscated class A drugs and did nothing, youll be fine.

				Were they talking about a second un ordered package? or had they intercepted yours and let it go through to follow it to you?

USA or UK using the postal service to transport drugs is not a small crime. It&#039;s a federal offence in most countries. I don&#039;t believe this story for a second, if they don&#039;t give a fuck about a gram why knock on his door then? They have better things to do but they can go knocking on someone&#039;s door asking them to flush their drugs? lol<br /><br />This guy should be considered LE by all here, and no one should ever talk with the police, call a lawyer if you can&#039;t handle the heat.

				I have been in prison for 2 months<br />been arrested like 3 times on drug dealing (all that was many years ago)<br /><br />The one and only rule anyone should know is:&nbsp; NEVER ADMIT ANYTHING , WITH OR WITHOUT LAWYER. THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE IN THE WORLD IS CONFESSION -&nbsp; thats all they want.<br /><br />They should do the hard work of finding evidences, don&#039;t do it for them by admitting.&nbsp; <br /><br />* from my past experience i had with UK cops, should be easier there... :)

				Thanks for the replies. I might have caved too easily but I&#039;d just woken up - I judged the situation and got out of it quickly and relatively painlessly. The last thing I wanted was to have more visits, lawyers, warrants and who knows what else. This is not the Wire but my name had clearly been connected to a significant (and seemingly errant) dealer, so it could have easily escalated.<br /><br />They were plain clothes but they left a card from the local force&#039;s &#039;drug unit&#039;. I didn&#039;t volunteer anything to start with but they were reasonable and straightforward, even if they did fabricate the bit about the bumper package (he actually stated &#039;about twenty varied bags and vials&#039; suggesting it was destined for me)... I&#039;m baffled if there&#039;s any truth in that... but it became clear they weren&#039;t interested in arresting me for possession of less than a gram so I let them have it. All I can say is I felt comfortable they weren&#039;t going to charge me, and they didn&#039;t. Informing the local bobbies about buying from SR wasn&#039;t ideal but it seemed the most reasonable thing to do at the time. And I&#039;m still here to tell the story, as implausible as that may seem to some.<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested to hear from anyone who has ordered from TheCookieJahMan, I checked the forums before and since and there was nothing mentioned, but 30 successful transactions convinced me. Him getting busted and my address turning up does seem likely but I do wonder if anything more unusual has happened here.<br /><br />My original order took a couple of days longer than I expected - it was marked shipped on the 14th but the postmark (from the other end of the country) says the 17th - the day before I received it. One of the detective constables (just checked his card) made it clear they do carry out controlled deliveries, seemingly warning me for the future.&nbsp; I have no way of knowing it it was opened, re-packaged and followed...&nbsp; the &#039;Enjoy my surprise&#039; message, signed with the seller&#039;s username really has got me thinking, though - handwriting in itself isn&#039;t best practice, and it&#039;s almost as if he knew what was coming...

Be fair with them and they will be fair with you.&nbsp; I got caught doing 70 in a 30 at 2 in the morning once.&nbsp; I apologized and admitted I had no reason other to get home after a long shift at work (I didn&#039;t actually admit to speeding).&nbsp; They told me I should know better then wheel spun off!<br />We could speculate till we&#039;re sober but we will never know the truth.&nbsp; One things sure, you better get your gear in person from now on.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is incredibly dangerous to think.&nbsp; Incredibly.&nbsp; Though I will say that I momentarily forgot this was in the UK specifically when I mentioned the don&#039;t talk to police video.<br /><br />Still, I would hope that if the man were going to bother spending his time and effort educating people on protecting themselves, he would have mentioned &quot;by the way, it&#039;s NOT like this in good old Britain!&quot; or something.&nbsp; Oh well, whatever -- we Americans and our pretentiousness, I suppose.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />EH? I said it&#039;s sometimes for your own good to be honest and fair with the police. esp on minor things. incriminating your self is a wee bit different to being honest. Admitting to personals is not the same as admitting to drug dealing or murder now is it.<br />Your not being pretentious at all my friend. You might want to work on your sarcasm tho<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s incredibly dangerous to have the mindset that if you&#039;re fair with them, they&#039;ll be fair with you.&nbsp; If you end up getting interrogated, they&#039;re out to break your will, confuse the fuck out of you, and somehow get you to confess.&nbsp; Thinking that they&#039;re *anything* except a mortal enemy makes their job that much easier.&nbsp; That&#039;s all I&#039;m saying, really.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I understand what your saying, I just mean the more stand offish you are the harder they will push. People make mistakes when pressured. I&#039;ve worked next to the uk police for a long time, and from my witnessed experiences ( obv not incl serious crime) the police want an easy life the same as you. If your an ass, they&#039;ll be a even bigger dick.<br /><br />&quot;Pussies don&#039;t like dicks because pussies get fucked by dicks. But dicks also fuck assholes. Assholes that just want to shit on everything. Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way. But the only thing that can fuck a asshole is a dick, with some balls. The problem with dicks is they fuck too much or fuck when it isn&#039;t appropriate. And it takes a pussy to show them that. But sometimes pussies can be so full of shit that they become assholes themselves. Because pussies are a inch and half away from assholes. I don&#039;t know much about this crazy crazy world, but I do know this. If you don&#039;t let us fuck this asshole we&#039;re going to have our dicks and pussies all covered in shit.&quot;<br /><br />I think Roger summed up his situation, relevant to him in his last post, better than both of us.<br />I cant give Karma, but every one gets a hug. I&#039;m half baked and have to go watch Team America now.<br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t last 5 minutes in downtown USA with my attitude, I know. Point taken.<br /><br />Of course I was manipulated into volunteering information but I judged the likely consequences and I was vindicated. I could be sat talking to a lawyer right now and it&#039;d have ultimately led to the same outcome - nothing happening, except I&#039;d be talking to a lawyer right now and I&#039;d be worried about my door being broken down at 6am. If you start with the &#039;no comment&#039; stuff you sound like a criminal and you&#039;re treated like one. I presented myself as a non-criminal and thankfully they bought it - he even praised my steady job and intellect when explaining why he wasn&#039;t taking any action. I guess I&#039;m lucky to live where I live.<br /><br />Why does it matter if I&#039;m a noob? Wouldn&#039;t a visit from the authorities be a decent reason to register for the forum? As it happens I have posted before, nothing significant, but given the attention I thought it sensible not to provide any more back story than necessary.

				Imagine if there was a cheeky vendor operating out of London area who only took orders in the vicinity.&nbsp; When you finalized, couple of rapscallions dressed as &#039;drug unit&#039; came and recouped the drugs for the next person to be had. <br /><br />&nbsp;You are so relieved you have been let off with possession of class A and besmirching Royal Mail&#039;s fine name you let it go and rejoin the half rolled spliff they didnt find on your coffee table..... ;D<br /><br />Or the original poster is a bullshitter because no one would admit all that to the police.&nbsp; Tbf I think the reason these types of post have low counts if any of them are genuine, is because it would be unwise to tie it to your real account in case a link could be formed.&nbsp; :)

If the feds were genuine guys they probably would have just confiscated the stuff and been on there way but most likely OP would have gotten a formal warning.<br /><br />My guess is that OP is a clean honest guy in regards to his criminal records.

				I can&#039;t believe how many people are slating this guy for telling this story. I live in the UK and this is totally 100% believable. Maybe because in America they&#039;ll cut your hands off for the same offence, you can&#039;t imagine it being any different over here? I&#039;ve heard of many many cases where cops will take a bit of personal off you and just throw it away.&nbsp; The bottom line is most police over here&nbsp; understand that there&#039;s no point trying to lock up the end user. They really are only interested in the dealers and even then they know that it&#039;s all a bit of a waste of time anyway because it doesn&#039;t matter how many dealers you lock up, another will always take it&#039;s place. I believe that if I was confronted with the same situation Roger was, I would probably have done the same thing knowing that the chances are they&#039;d just give me a slap on the wrist and shake their finger at me a bit. Even if they wanted to take it further, at the very most, all that would happen is that you might get an official caution for a first time offence. There is no way you&#039;re going to get prosecuted for a gram of mandy. Be respectful to them in scenarios like this and most of the time they will be respectful back. They are so used to getting shit of dickheads who are pissed up and fighting with there sisters or whatever that they know when they talk to you, you aren&#039;t really any trouble. Let me just stress this one more time, this is the UK, not America. It&#039;s very different.

				I&#039;m from the UK and this advice of &quot;British police are just out to be good folks and won&#039;t give you any trouble if you&#039;re honest&quot; is just straight up DUMB.<br /><br />That may be true for a few of them. Or even, a greater percentage of them than in America. But it is still fucking retarded to admit to something like this. They are out for charges. The more successful charges they get, the further they go up the police ladder. That&#039;s just how it works. You&#039;re very lucky that you ran into this guy. I&#039;ve seen countless people get caught with drugs and I&#039;ve NEVER seen them let go. <br /><br />And of all places, to see people HERE saying that you should just cooperate with them, I&#039;m at a loss for words. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Especially the guy above me. <br /><br />This is some of the most ridiculous shit I&#039;ve ever seen on here: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maybe because in America they&#039;ll cut your hands off for the same offence, you can&#039;t imagine it being any different over here?

Because this is patently false. <br /><br />99% of time if you are caught with class As in the UK you WILL be arrested AND charged. And even if you&#039;ve just got some weed, it certainly isn&#039;t worth taking the risk. The majority of them will NOT let you go. The majority of them DO believe that drug users should be punished.<br /><br />&quot;They really are only interested in the dealers.&quot; Hmm.. Is that why 80,000+ people at the VERY MINIMUM are arrested simply for possession in the UK every year? That&#039;s a strange way of going after the dealers. <br /><br />Look mate I don&#039;t know what your motive is spouting off this bollocks, or if you&#039;re just so dumb and inexperienced with police that you genuinely believe the utter vacuous bullshit you&#039;re passing off as knowledge, but you need to stop because you&#039;re going to get people into serious trouble.

				I also live in the UK and can vouch for the police here not playing by the rules.<br />A couple of years ago plain clothed police stopped me and my friend, handcuffed me to the steering wheel and began looking for drugs.<br />I had nothing at all on me and the police were clearly pissed of about this, one of them then put his hand in my pocket and pulled out foil covered in heroin. I was an addict at the time but know for certain that was not in my pocket.<br />They just crushed it up and threw it down a drain and then told me &quot;we just saved you a £500 fine, now tell us who is doing the gear round here&quot; - needless to say I refused and they proceeded to offer me cash to go and SCORE for them! As far as I know this is totally illegal in the UK as it is entrapment. I refused this also and they let me go on my way.<br />Although I must add that I don&#039;t really believe the OP&#039;s story- I don&#039;t see UK police coming to your address for 1 gram of MDMA, in my case of police corruption they were after 1oz of Heroin which is a considerably larger crime to posses/distribute.<br />

				Also OP, I think telling them about SR is a big mistake.<br />As someone has said before, the less they know the better and there was absolutely no reason for you to admit to anything.<br />Before I buy shit on here I have everything down for the off chance that the police do come knocking.<br />I would follow the advice of the &quot;never talk to police&quot; video and say nothing, get your lawyer and explain shit to him.<br />At the end of the day, anyone can post anything to anyone elses address, if all they have on you is that drugs were posted to your house then the court will never get a conviction for that. They need solid evidence, in most cases a confession.

				Wow. <br /><br />You finished?<br /><br />This year I was on my way to a festival and my mate was carrying a couple of g&#039;s of mandy and a gram of charlie. Sniffer dogs get him.

But I do also appreciate the fact that by doing this you are running the risk of being wrong.

If you admit to it, there is a slight chance they will let you off, however there is also a strong chance they will arrest you and charge you anyway.<br />If you go for the latter then you will be held in custody and taken to court from there, where the police will say you have admitted the offense. Chances are you will get bail and have to return to court for your sentencing.<br />If you follow my advice and dont say shit then yes you will be arrested and interviewed for several hours, they will threaten you and make it clear how much better of you would be just admitting the offense. Dont. Ultimately after 2 days at most, they will either release you without charge or the court will bail you. Your now in a much better position as there is a very high chance that even if you were charged the charges will be dropped. Worst case is the CPS thinks they can get a conviction and they take it to trial, if you have done everything right and stuck to your plan to say nothing they will have no other solid evidence and no jury will be able to find you guilty.<br />Just my opinion but I very strongly believe the OP should not have mentioned SR- just don&#039;t see how that could ever help your case.

				Living in the UK I can believe the OP&#039;s story.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it just totally depends on who the cop is.&nbsp; Local officers in my experience have generally been pretty reasonable guys tbh.&nbsp; But then you obviously get your mini Hitlers who&#039;ll do whatever they can to get a charge.<br /><br />I think the worst thing you could do is give it the &quot;no comment&quot; *close the door in their face* cos that&#039;ll just piss them off and is basically admitting guilt.<br /><br />You&#039;re probably best to act exactly how you would if cops had just randomly turned up at your door accusing you of something you have no idea about!

				the vendor hasn&#039;t been responding to any of my messages for atleast 2 days. within 24hrs of this thread starting (and the related feedback relating to this matter) the vendor took all of his listings offline without explanation. although op&#039;s is an asshole for describing the packaging, the description lines up with a vague description of the packaging that the vendor used to have on his profile. <br />The police were oblivious to sr so that makes me wonder if the vendor may have been raided due to an sr related matter, and LE was just following all the information that was gathered from the scene. That being said, LE might profile the packaging method and flag any orders that are in transit (is that even possible?) i don&#039;t mean to cause panic.

Sniffer dogs get him. Police say &quot;hand it over and you can still go in the festival, deny you&#039;ve got it and you&#039;ll get searched and if we find anything we&#039;ll take you down to the station.&quot; I&#039;m aware this is at a festival so slightly different but he gave them the stuff and even had a bit of a laugh with them when they found he was trying to smuggle it in in a moisturiser bottle. They took his photo and said if he gets in any more trouble during the festival then they&#039;ll take him to the station. Point is, he then went on his way and had a pretty good weekend. What would have been the better thing to do here? Deny all knowledge of the substances and demand a lawyer to be present before he was searched? <br /><br />&quot;99% of time if you are caught with class As in the UK you WILL be arrested AND charged.&quot; Must&#039;ve been the lucky 1% then yeah?<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying every police officer is just gonna throw it away but a fair amount will. I think you need to bear in mind circumstances when people get arrested for possession. It depends on a lot of things including who the copper is and what you act like when they catch you. Not all police are a harsh robotic translation of the law, they can use some discretion.<br /><br />I don&#039;t wanna get people in trouble, all I&#039;m doing is talking from my discussions with the police and from those I know that have had run ins. I thought these forums were about sharing your experiences? <br /><br />I still think the bottom line is, Roger got away without any problems at all, is he the lucky 1% too?<br /><br />Ok fair enough he could have been safer by denying knowledge of anything and then disposing of the evidence before the police came back but not everybody is a stone faced bad ass and feels confident that they can beat the system in this way. He obviously judged the situation intelligently enough to think he wasn&#039;t gonna get in anymore trouble. It seems he was right. But I do also appreciate the fact that by doing this you are running the risk of being wrong.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I totally understand what you are saying.<br />Basically I see it like this: if you are caught with anything and you refuse to admit to it- you will be arrested and taken to the police cells, probably for 2 days max. If you admit to it, there is a slight chance they will let you off, however there is also a strong chance they will arrest you and charge you anyway.<br />If you go for the latter then you will be held in custody and taken to court from there, where the police will say you have admitted the offense. Chances are you will get bail and have to return to court for your sentencing.<br />If you follow my advice and dont say shit then yes you will be arrested and interviewed for several hours, they will threaten you and make it clear how much better of you would be just admitting the offense. Dont. Ultimately after 2 days at most, they will either release you without charge or the court will bail you. Your now in a much better position as there is a very high chance that even if you were charged the charges will be dropped. Worst case is the CPS thinks they can get a conviction and they take it to trial, if you have done everything right and stuck to your plan to say nothing they will have no other solid evidence and no jury will be able to find you guilty.<br />Just my opinion but I very strongly believe the OP should not have mentioned SR- just don&#039;t see how that could ever help your case.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have thought about this a lot today and I totally get what you are saying. It makes sense. I honestly think I&#039;m gonna start having a serious think about a plan of action in case this scenario happened to me which neither implicates SR or admits to guilt. If anyone has actual experience of being caught with personal and has taken the route of outright denial I know it would probably help myself and many others if you started a thread about exactly what happens in this scenario, how to behave, what exactly to say, what to do if they turn up with a warrant etc? Maybe there already is a thread like this? I agree that if you&#039;re using this site then these are probably things you should know. Also, I imagine the OP probably mentioned SR because he didn&#039;t have a back up plan in place and was so shocked to find the drug unit on his doorstep that he didn&#039;t know what else to do except tell the truth. I reckon there&#039;s many many people here who don&#039;t have a properly thought out plan for when this worst case scenario occurs.

They also mentioned that a vendor had been arrested. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t order various powders, I ordered 1g of MDMA, from TheCookieJahMan, which I received the day before. It wasn&#039;t stealthily packaged, just a baggie taped to a card, with a handwritten note saying &#039;Hope you enjoy the surprise&#039;... a message which confused me at the time and still does. Nevertheless it contained quality class A drugs. This seller was new but was attracting glowing reviews, he was up to about 30 transactions on 100% when I ordered.<br /><br />Whatever happened that led the police to my door, I don&#039;t know. Most likely I think the seller was busted and my address found at the premises, leading the police to wonder if I had any significant role in this. Going on what the police said, I&#039;m supposed to believe this seller had some sort of lapse and sent me a huge bag of drugs I didn&#039;t order. I see that as less likely. Whatever happened, there has been a serious security breach here.<br /><br />The cops were reasonable and I knew it was more likely to end there and then if I just told the truth. I was confident there was very little they could charge me with (or could be bothered to charge me with) so I admitted buying the gram and told them where from, educated them somewhat, as they looked on with genuine interest. I reasoned if I denied having anything in the house they could come back and turn the place over so I surrendered the gram. To his credit the PC saw I was respectable and cooperative and agreed to overlook it, so that went down the toilet and they were on their way. No charges, but this will be noted on some record somewhere, won&#039;t it?<br /><br />Does anyone have any other theories about what happened here?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As a rule I don&#039;t give concrete advice to anyone under 100 posts, unless they joined prior November, as an OP with &lt;10 posts, and on a question like this, is a bit of a red flag. I&#039;m going to reiterate a part from SS.... part of this doesn&#039;t add up. Actually, more than one part. Feel free to correct me at any stage.<br /><br />You wrote that the police said they suspected a much larger package headed your way. They wouldn&#039;t have been &quot;bobbies&quot; but a [edit, disregard] if that were the case. Even if a smaller amount, standard procedure here is to thoroughly reconnoiter the premise first, then move in with tasers (but state police if only a small amount) if any reasonable doubt of armed occupants/hard drug affected residing in said premise. They would only casually lob up on your doorstep if they knew they were in no danger (at least that&#039;s the mindset here and it probably would be there also; they usually want to know what&#039;s on the other side of a door before entering, then again some just charge in like 3 year olds but usually they&#039;ll put premise under surveillance first. Small Dick Syndrome). Then again it&#039;s U.K. so whatever.....<br /><br />I find it puzzling that the Drug Unit has not even heard of SR. This has to be a joke, right? It&#039;s weird that not one person in U.K. has made a single order from SR. Because that&#039;s how it would have to be for a narc not to know about SR.<br /><br />I read with wistfulness so-and-so&#039;s post. [edit: FUCK!! I can no longer find post in question. Makes me look unprofessional if I can&#039;t quote name&nbsp; :&#039;( ]<br /><br />They certainly don&#039;t take that kind of relaxed view over here. They get aroused over a couple gram of coke (probably because they can&#039;t get laid), it&#039;s like they&#039;re wanting to be noticed by the station sergeant and can&#039;t wait to put someone in cuffs, even if they release them 1 hour later.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94990.msg673318#msg673318">Quote from: Roger on December 20, 2012, 11:04 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">so I admitted buying the gram and told them where from, educated them somewhat, as they looked on with genuine interest.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This leads me to believe it was on your computer that they viewed this?

I refused this also and they let me go on my way.<br />Although I must add that I don&#039;t really believe the OP&#039;s story- I don&#039;t see UK police coming to your address for 1 gram of MDMA, in my case of police corruption they were after 1oz of Heroin which is a considerably larger crime to posses/distribute.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />...is the reason I view LE as scum. They break the law same as us, but get away with it not like us, because they have a badge. +1 from me. (To lifeis420, not the police!!! The police can have a free kick in the head. Disgraceful.)<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Remember to have fun this Christmas everybody, and don&#039;t listen to those idiots in the media telling you to hold back on the food to avoid the usual post-Christmas weight gain of .5 kg. It only comes once a year, so rock out with your cock out and just go nuts at the buffet. Oh, and don&#039;t think that if you put on a bit of weight your partner doesn&#039;t want to *boink* you until you&#039;ve lost it in January like 90% of the population because that&#039;s just BS. If you hold back they&#039;re only going to come to me for loving so it;&#039;s in your best interests.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Merry Christmas motherpuchers!!!&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; ;) Mwah!&nbsp; ;)

Since the &#039;war on drugs&#039; was declared by the US the number of addicts and users in the US has exploded, as has the amount of drugs available on the streets.&nbsp; Unofficially, I don&#039;t believe governments believe they can win the war on drugs, or are even bothered. Jesus, the CIA have been caught shipping drugs into the US!&nbsp; &nbsp;If the &#039;war on drugs&#039; was real, the US army would&#039;ve sprayed and wiped out the poppy fields of Afghanistan years ago.&nbsp; The truth is, the governments of the world and corrupt banking system rely on the illicit drug trade and the billions it generates.&nbsp; To completely end cocaine or heroin production would cripple the world economy (more than it already is!).<br /><br />The public face of the &#039;war on drugs&#039; is all for show.... This &quot;being tough on drugs&quot; has lead to draconian laws being passed in the US which creates a steady stream of prisoners to fill up the corporate prisons.&nbsp; A terrible situation, which has effectively become the new face of slavery, as the prisoners are forced to work for peanuts. The Great American Gulag.<br /><br />My main point is that the UK is a world apart from what goes on in the US, and many of the posts on this thread highlight the huge cultural differences.&nbsp; If confronted by LE I don&#039;t think any sane Silkroader would ever admit to knowing anything about the drugs which have been mailed to their house, especially in the US.&nbsp; Plausible denial all the way.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I just don&#039;t think the UK police would somehow blackmail a SR buyer into being their snitch (over a gram), especially after throwing the drugs down the toilet and not formally charging the person.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do agree with you that police keep records of investigations, and as I said earlier, if I was Roger I would not be having any more envelopes sent to that address!&nbsp; As much as I&#039;m playing down the events of Rogers story and the likely repercussions, I know I&#039;d be very paranoid if I was in his shoes.<br /><br />Anyway, don&#039;t worry about me, I&#039;m far from complacent or ill-informed, and having small amounts of drugs sent to an address in the name of a previous tenant is one of the less risky things I&#039;ve done this year.&nbsp; I have my cover story, as I&#039;m sure most of us do.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just think some people on here are angry that Roger mentioned the SR to the police.&nbsp; This is an unwritten rule that most on here would never break. Surely it&#039;s much easier to say you scored the MDMA in a club, etc, hence &#039;supplier unknown&#039;.<br /><br />Merry Christmas all :)

				The whole concept of SR is that the buyer and seller can remain anonymous. If the vendor is using proper procedure there shouldn&#039;t be any evidence that can track back to him. If this story is true, it&#039;s really the vendors fault for having a hard copy of the buyer&#039;s address. People who make regular bulk purchases on SR for resell should consider the fact that the vendor could have evidence of your address and order history in plain format.

Now, I&#039;ve lived on this planet for a while. And a while fucking longer than a child like you that&#039;s for sure. And I&#039;ve had countless run ins with the police. As have my friends, in every culture, I&#039;ve ever been a part of. And because of the rave culture, I always end up running into police. And they ALWAYS CHARGE. ALWAYS.

				The advise to admit nothing is right because at the end of the day unless they have a search warrant then all they can do is give verbal pressure.<br /><br />Even if they threatened to come back with a warrant then you would still have time to flush the stash. If you admit anything or they see/smell anything then they no longer need a warrant and can just force their way in and search.<br /><br />In this case though the OP got off lucky with perhaps a good outcome as the police no longer think OP is part of a dealer network.<br /><br />If they had enough evidence, a phone call and a fax machine is all that is needed to get a warrant and you would have been raided. The fact that they did not kick your door down means they had very little to use against you and you would be highly advised to remain silent.<br /><br />I do watch police camera action and the amount times that people get done for a little weed shows that it is also quite common to get charged by police for a victimless crime. (unless it&#039;s because the camera&#039;s are on them and so they cannot be seen to be soft).<br />So in UK there is so much variance in outcome that it is best to err on the side of caution.<br /><br />Surely in USA there must be some police that would look the other way, are they all like hittlers? In the UK allot must depend on their personal view and whether they need points for their career ladder. <br />But it IS against the law and drug convictions look especially bad in the eyes of the misguided public. So best to play it safe.<br /><br />Worst comes to worst, in UK there is at least a chance that you might get let for percy.

I goddamn knew it.&nbsp; &gt;:( If someone I cared about got murdered or my dog got stolen the police would not do anything as I do not live in [edit] or [edit] or other exclusive suburb where the police actually do their job out of fear. So I need not worry about burning bridges with that one. <br /><br />Politicians set the rules by implementing legislation that police are bound to enforce, but they sure as hell don&#039;t regulate the way police operate their stations. Stealing someone&#039;s drugs and reselling it is not only hypocritical but immoral, as they are partly responsible for crimes committed while the perp is high. That makes you guys just as bad as us, even worse. <br /><br />The fact that no one likes you is not OUR fault. It is not an anti-police attitude at all. If you stopped abusing people and being hypocrites you&#039;d have some actual respect. We are sick of your &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality, and then turning round and alleging that WE have the attitude. The fact that people avoid you like the plague is not our fault. You have caused that and can blame no one but yourselves. <br /><br />And don&#039;t pretend that &quot;cops are just doing their jobs&quot;, because unless you&#039;re rich or there&#039;s a PR reason, you pretty much do jack-all.

The knock on the door had nothing to do with his gram, but it could well be from a copy of his address found in the raid on another house with a pile of drugs and bags and shipping envelopes. <br /><br />Admitted the gram, didn&#039;t get charged.<br /><br />Told them about SR, not great but hardly &quot;snitch, grass&quot; etc. I mean it&#039;s an ANONYMOUS marketplace which is already in the mass media. He hasn&#039;t landed anyone it in at all. In fact if it was someone he knew that had sent it to him, and he was charged, then saying it came from SR would actually be a positive as that&#039;s then a dead end for them. <br />So, yea that&#039;s not the end of the world.<br /><br />TheCookieJahMan vendor page - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/760664bfe8 No active listings and offline the last 3 days, but there is a note saying he is not sending now until the 28th so maybe he&#039;s just offline for a holiday. Maybe not, who knows.<br /><br />The drug war is global but I&#039;ve yet to be in another country in the world where the LE is as brainwashed as they are in the USA.<br /><br />I would never have confessed to the gram but it&#039;s definitely not outside the realm of possibility that if he did, and acted the right way, he could have been let off by the copper. It happens.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if its true or not but I don&#039;t see what&#039;s so crazy about it.

				I&#039;m back., and I have to say some of the responses have been paranoid in the extreme. I appreciate the prescriptive approach and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s kept you all clean for years, but I let my guard down, approached in on a human level and thank fuck, it paid off. Thanks to those who see the situation for what it was, I guess culture is very different either side of the Atlantic. If I was dead set on keeping my gram and I had any sort of experience in this situation, I&#039;d have denied it. And I take that criticism. But they were clearly acting on a tip off - I imagine a distant police force contacted the unit and said &#039;mail order drugs - see what you can find&#039;... they arrived and everything about me screamed &#039;recreational dabbler&#039; and it was clear to me that they weren&#039;t there for a 0.8g charge and my co-operation helped. I regret giving them the gram but they made it clear they wanted a look around and at least it tied my story together - it&#039;s Christmas ffs, I just wanted them out of there and I didn&#039;t compromise anyone but myself in admitting possession.<br /><br />What motivation could I have for making this up, other that to discredit the seller?... Well that is precisely what I&#039;m doing, with good reason, and I&#039;d like to get to the bottom of the clusterfuck that was his handwritten card. Seemingly you don&#039;t need any sort of expertise or intellect to come into possession of quality MDMA these days. The seller hasn&#039;t logged in for three days and from my conversation with the police I gather we&#039;ll not be seeing him for a while. He&#039;s the guy that deserves the negative karma here.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t tell them anything that they couldn&#039;t have found out by typing two words into Google. I think anyone crying &#039;snitch&#039; here should consider how seriously you&#039;re take all of this, are you that desperate to portray yourself as an outlaw? I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary. This is increasingly how police drug work is going to be done and I know I&#039;ve been complacent and can&#039;t continue what I was doing, and I&#039;ve taken responsibility for that, not for everything else I&#039;ve been accused of here.<br /><br />I&#039;ll happily answer any questions I&#039;ve overlooked.

				goes without saying that a vendor should use appropriate packaging for their safety and ours, I still don&#039;t believe the police story and imagine it was all fabricated to have a moan about the vendors packaging. stick with legit reliable vendors and you shouldn&#039;t have anything&nbsp; intercepted, well not domestic anyway. <br /><br />I suppose if anything has come from this thread it&#039;s that none of us should be complacent, and always have a plan b if shit hits the fan. <br /><br />

				I believe Roger&#039;s story and in the same situation, I&#039;d have done the same as him.<br /><br />The police here in the UK take a rather more pragmatic approach to drug crime than their counterparts in the US.&nbsp; Their focus is purely and simply to target the trade in heroin and cocaine (specifically crack), because it drives the vast majority of property crime - burglary, shoplifting, robbery, breaking into cars.&nbsp; So yes, get caught carrying heroin or crack and plod will arrest, interrogate, and the user will often end up in court.&nbsp; Their priority is to go after the dealers.&nbsp; Drug rehab orders from the courts generally come first, repeat offences often lead to prison, for breaking the terms of the rehab orders.<br /><br />The police aren&#039;t interested in otherwise law-abiding citizens caught in possession of personal amounts of &quot;recreational&quot; drugs, which is consistent with what many brits have written on this thread.&nbsp; Being caught with ounces of weed or larger quantities of powders makes you a dealer, and then they will be alot more interested, and that&#039;s the point you need to shut up and lawyer up.<br /><br />And to all of you berating Roger for telling plod about the Silk Road - please enlighten me and tell me what impact this will have on the site or any of its users?

				Roger, thanks for sharing your story.&nbsp; I hope you recognize that you were lucky with your gamble on giving back the g, lucky with your choice of policemen, and lucky that you&#039;re a well-spoken, likely white middle-class (or higher) male in a good neighborhood (which I&#039;m inferring from your &quot;screams dabbler&quot; comment).&nbsp; Not everyone is so lucky on all these counts. I think the pain and negative reactions you&#039;re seeing from others is shock and indignation that what worked for you, most certainly would not work for them.&nbsp; If there&#039;s anything I&#039;ve learned from this thread, it&#039;s that these forums are populated by many different kinds of people.&nbsp; Class carries privilege, and it&#039;s hard for either side to see it.<br /><br />Some parts of the US are saner than others when it comes to drugs.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard stories in San Francisco where a friend was taken to the drunk tank for public intoxication, and the coke in his wallet simply disappeared.&nbsp; Weed has been decriminalized in the whole state (citation only, no arrest for possession under a certain amount),&nbsp; and in San Francisco you can smoke it in some public places like parks, some cafes, and outdoor festivals without a worry - cops just smile when they walk through a cloud of smoke.

				I cant believe some of the replies in this thread by the americans, can you please stop posting and replying trying to convince everyone you actually know things about the law and police in the UK then going on to state &quot;federal laws&quot; and so forth shut the fuck up.<br /><br />Not all police are &quot;out to get out&quot; and are the MORAL ENEMYS your deluded, this is not America. Like already said the better thing to do was to just give him the gram, hes not a dealer he dosent want them coming back with a search warrant and tearing his place up, if you start being dicks to the police they will come back and bite you, they will try again and again till they get you, in this case the best thing was just to comply as he had nothing to lose. The police are humans too, believe it or not they can be very reasonable. All those giving him negative feedback are silly, you dont think that the police dont know about SR? Shhhhhhhh please

				I cant believe this is still going on.. This has got to be all Teenagers on this forums except for a few who have sense about the Police and How they work and what the FUCKING GOAL IS!.. To the above post Most people become COps cause they were pushed around and bullied in school and this is a way they have control and can do something to people they see in their eyes as the type that use to pick on them back when they were younger.. ALL of them have control issues and God knowshow many others i dont even feel like gettig into.. Again you can really tell tht a lot of people on this Post are kids under age thats why they are not worried about much when dealing with the law, one person even said &#039;not much to worry bout except them telling your parents&#039; WTF? really?? In grown up life when your not under your parents wing an protecting of your age, your getting NAILED and your taking a ride for the type of shit the OP spoke of.. Iv been to prison iv been to jail so have many of my associates, some of you are not living in a grown world that much is clear.. I dont aim that comment at every person on the thread but if you feel like im talking bout you then it must be the guilt, Which is nothing wrong with being young n dumb but dont come on here saying its OK to speak to LAW and give them INFO so they can be on their way. ITS NOT OK!! You are snitching yourself out and working with the LAW which is not cool, Youll learn as you get older,(I HOPE NOT) BUT some of you will.. GUYS ITS NOT OK TO HELP AND AID LE!! NOT IN ANYWAY!! If you dont like my post FUCK U!! Only ons that wont like it or give me negative feedback are kids n Morons who have never lived through what some of us have and know how the SYSTEM AND LE REALLY WORK!!! HATE IT OR LOVE IT, IDGAF

				I think that it is often perfectly reasonable to cooperate with police investigating assault, murder, robbery, vandalism etc. ie Real Crimes against good honest hard working people.<br /><br />If I seen a burglar breaking into a house then damn right I&#039;d call the police. If I had cctv footage of some smack-head scrote smashing into a car then I would hand it over.<br /><br />Most active criminals are pure sick evil bastards. The only real exception I&#039;ve come across&nbsp; is the majority of medium to small time drug users and dealers.<br />Crimes against large corporation are sometimes also less morally unacceptable, though stuff like insurance fraud pushes up the price for everyone(but that is still not worth grassing over).<br /><br />Grassing someone up over drugs or some other victimless crime is bang out of order.<br /><br />The OP did not grass on any living person.<br /><br />He was more likely to get himself into bother than anyone else, he does not even know the dealers name or location for fuck sake.<br /><br />Maybe he should not have mentioned the silk road. <br />He should have maybe just said that he bought it off the net or off some dodgy looking geezer of average height, average age and average hair style.<br />

				This is plain and simple someone low on the food chain spilling his guts to save himself regardless of the potential harm to others up the foodchain. The damage done was only limited by the ops lack of information to give up.<br />Sounds like this was just an obligatory visit based on information received but in other circumstances the op is just the kind of prson the police do wring for information that does get other people banged up.<br />The dont cooperate mindset is something that you get over years , some people here simply dont have it and thats how the police get alot of their info.<br />Be safe.

I really can&#039;t.<br /><br />Some of you, (not the guy above) should be fucking ashamed. Are you 16 year old kids? You have got to be kidding me.<br /><br />Any of you. ANY OF YOU. Who are saying, that we should cooperate with police, because UK police, are more lenient..<br /><br />And then.. you have the fucking gall, to pull out an example of your mate at a festival, and then use it to justify your previous claim that &quot;MOST POLICE DON&#039;T CARE ABOUT DRUG USERS&quot; (your words not mine Maximus)....<br /><br />I mean seriously, that&#039;s what happened isn&#039;t it. Are you people reading this missing this? He starts off by saying &quot;most police are just out to get dealers..&quot;.. and then he uses an example, of HIS SINGLE FRIEND BEING LET OFF.. as justification.<br /><br />You fucking idiot. You must be a kid. You honestly, must be a kid. Noone with any sort of intelligence, could be capable of such retardation.<br /><br />And it&#039;s not even just you. There are other people here saying this. I&#039;ve been off sr for a couple months but fuck me. The sort of mentality you are passing around right now, was NOWHERE a couple of months ago.<br /><br />What the fuck has happened? Sr is still going strong yet you fucking faggots are perpetuating these idiotic mindsets? Get the FUCK OFF here. I&#039;ll say it again.<br /><br />Maximus. Are you a fucking child? You&#039;re a child aren&#039;t you. You literally, said earlier, that most police don&#039;t care about possession, they&#039;d rather care about dealers. Now, I&#039;ve lived on this planet for a while. And a while fucking longer than a child like you that&#039;s for sure. And I&#039;ve had countless run ins with the police. As have my friends, in every culture, I&#039;ve ever been a part of. And because of the rave culture, I always end up running into police. And they ALWAYS CHARGE. ALWAYS. The shit you are trying to pass off, is fucking RIDICULOUS.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To start, you&#039;re a complete prick.<br /><br />Now that&#039;s out of the way let me deal with the one sided story you&#039;re trying to spin.<br /><br />You&#039;ve obviously never had an experience with a liberal police officer. Unlucky. That example at the festival is just one of many I know of. I don&#039;t have to tell you in detail about every fucking experience, I gave you an example.<br />There&#039;s been several posts here from other people who have also had experiences similar to Roger&#039;s &quot;lucky&quot; let off due to it only being a personal amount. I&#039;m not the only one by a long shot.<br />Maybe it&#039;s because you act like you think you&#039;re a bad ass that you and your mates get arrested? I&#039;ve been caught with weed and the cops literally didn&#039;t give a shit. They just threw it away and buzzed a bit off telling me off. Which fucking part of the country are you from? Remind me to never fucking go there because it sounds like you &#039;re living in North Korea.<br />I&#039;m not saying you should rely on cops letting you off. There are MANY cops that love busting anyone and will but from my experience (trust me I ain&#039;t no fucking kid) there are also many that take a realistic view on it. We all know the war on drugs is a joke and purely a political agenda. Do you not think many of them know that too? They ain&#039;t all that stupid. <br />The fact is a lot of the time they&#039;ve got bigger fish to fry than fucking around filling in paperwork for some guy having a bit of personal on him. What damage is the social drug taker really doing to society? THEY KNOW THIS. <br />I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m mates with the police. Obviously I dislike what they are employed to do when it comes to getting off my tits. But I can&#039;t agree with what you&#039;re saying because I&#039;ve had totally different experiences. Simple as that.<br />I think you&#039;re an angry motherfucker who literally won&#039;t listen to anyone else&#039;s opinion except your own. Seriously you tit have you not realised yet that not everyone has had the same experiences as you?<br />All I&#039;m really saying&nbsp; is it&#039;s not black and white like you seem to think it is when it comes to police. There IS discretion and other factors involved. But you cannot rely on it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The fact is Maximus, and this is a fact, you know NOTHING. Really, in real life, you know absolutely next to fuck all about the shit you are talking about.<br /><br />You are advocating SNITCHING. And your justification for doing so, initially, was because someone got let off at a festival. I&#039;m not saying that didn&#039;t happen. It probably did. In fact, I know this shit does go on. But then you go on to say that &quot;this isn&#039;t the only example I can think of&quot;<br /><br />Now say I take your word for it, and assume that you aren&#039;t simply a fucking child, which you clearly are.. Are you honestly going to say that the MAJORITY of cases, the police will let you off, if you are honest with them? Your whole premise seems to be based upon the notion that &quot;it isn&#039;t black and white&quot;. Yeah, in the real world, people have different beliefs and perspectives. And they act differently, and unexpectedly sometimes. But what are you saying? Because there are potential, (and miniscule) vagueries in police behaviour, we should make a practice out of the outliers? <br /><br />You say &quot;it isn&#039;t black and white&quot;<br /><br />I say, its black, grey and white, and its 95% 3% 2%<br /><br />Now extrapolate a thing called pragmatism and hold your cock between your legs you idealistic fucker.<br /><br />Can I just get you to be straight here, and say what you really mean? Do you think that most of the time they will let you off? Half of the time? Some of the time? A tenth of the time? What the fuck are you saying?<br /><br />Here at SR we deal in pragmatism. You may not like it, but, I&#039;ve said this before and let me repeat it, because anyone with half a fucking brain knows that it is true.<br /><br />The police ladder is built upon CHARGES. The more successful charges they get, the HIGHER UP THE LADDER THEY GO. If a policeman wants to become a superintendent or some other bullshit rank, he has to get more successful charges than his other offices, fact. It&#039;s as simple as that mate.<br /><br />Yet you claim, that I&#039;ve never met a liberal police officer. Mate I&#039;ve done coke with off duty coppers before. I&#039;ve been to turkish brothels with off duty coppers before. I know that liberal police do exist. <br /><br />But because they exist, we should make SNITCHING AND TELLING THEM ABOUT SR, a practice? <br /><br />This is why I think that you must be at best 15-16. Or just a very naive adult with no experience of the real world. The absolute, the UNDENIABLE fact, is that, 95+% of the time, if caught with drugs, you WILL be charged.<br /><br />No way around that. Plain as fucking day. <br /><br />So don&#039;t take this personally, but when I see you, at SR of all places, advocating cooperating, and fucking snitching, to the police... I have to go off on you. Because that is stupidity of an undeniable level. A fucking Chaucerian level. A Shakespearian level of idiocy. <br /><br />Liberal police do exist. But they are a minority. The ONLY advice, you should be following, is to, if approached, SAY NOTHING.. and if arrested, SAY NOTHING UNTIL YOUR SOLICITOR GETS THERE. <br /><br />Everyone knows this, including people like me from the UK.

				My first thought on reading this thread was the OP fell for some very basic pig psychology:<br /><br />&quot; Would you mind explaining why a package containing PCP, carfentanil, date rape and meow meow smack cake was found addresses to you?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I....I....I.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I only ordered a gramme of MDMA?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Oh did you now sir? Well if you just hand it over we won&#039;t have to empty all your furniture out into the street and tell your mum.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Ok thank you officer.. and people say we live in a police state&quot;<br /><br />I had to laugh cos me and my mates had similar done to us as teenagers. A gang of track suited scallies jumped us in the street and asked us if we had any drugs? When we realized it was the police my mate had an eighth of skunk in his pocket. They managed to convince him they had the right to ransack his parents house for more, so if he had it he&#039;d better just go in quietly and bring it them. He shit it and brought them the rest of the half ounce. We reckoned he should of called their bluff but in our defense these were the old fashioned police who were a bit rough. They were laughing about all the weed they smoked in amsterdam as they drove us back the station. One was a proper police and seemed to have the decency to be embarrassed by his colleagues antics.

				Yes, Hungry ghost, one of their many mind games.<br /><br />I can&#039;t tell you how many cases like this I&#039;ve heard over the years. Cops will freely admit that in many cases prosecution would have been unlikely, if not impossible, were it not for a full confession. One of their tricks of the trade is that they will make you believe that they&#039;ve got hard evidence when they really have none, or will hint at having more evidence then they really do. Faced with seemingly irrefutable evidence, many people will crack under the pressure of investigation and confess to everything. Or if the cops present them with (obviously made up) evidence of a more serious crime (eg higher quantity of drugs), the suspect thinks it is in their interest to confess straight away - after all their crime is smaller than the cops think it is! <br /><br />Speaking to the cops will get you in trouble - if you don&#039;t speak to them* then they can&#039;t play these mind games. Even if they really do have hard evidence - say nothing. Once you confess, it&#039;s game over. As I&#039;ve said before, there is really nothing to be gained by admitting to a crime to the police. They will obviously tell you otherwise, but let me tell you something - lawyer up first, then do the talking later.<br /><br />*&nbsp; &quot;don&#039;t speak to them&quot; doesn&#039;t mean act like an asshole like many think it does. Obviously act respectfully, and answer any questions unrelated to the case itself, but there is no need to volunteer any information.

				I think you hit the nail on the head kappacino, I imagine those advocating talking to old bill are probably young, middle class and a little wet behind the ears, they still see the police as people to trust, when for a lot of us we know that not to be the case. these are the people who will happily blow others up to save themselves and to appease mummy &amp; daddy. thankfully we have a lot of anonymity on this site as you certainly couldn&#039;t trust these people, old bill will have a field day with them if they do get lifted.

				Screw the haters. I hardly think the two cops went back to the station to announce &#039;hey guys I bet none of you have ever heard of silk road and sending drugs in the post!&#039; Seriously they know damn well it goes on and it just isnt really a priority in the uk. Despite what you might think and what your own personal dealing with the police are, when discretion is within their remit being as seemingly fully cooperative as possible with them can save you a lot of time. Even if they go to prosecute I have friends that have previously been busted twice for possesion of class a drugs and never been sent down. I think anyone from the usa might have a hard time believing this but honest to god its pretty difficult to get sent to jail for less than say 30 pills or a half ounce of coke. As long as its not all bagged up separately looking dodge that amount of drugs can be deemed personal. Iv been completely honest before when busted with 15 pills going into a festival and said im a fucking junkie I have avery high tolerance to exstacy please dont rufuse me entry and iv been let in (minus my beans ofc) <br />What I was trying to say before I got sidetracked was that telling them something they already know and dobbing yourself in is not against the unspoken underground rules. Half the haters on this this thread are just trying to get their own cocks wanked by attempting to espouse pseudo integrity among their criminal fraternity. Yes we all intrinsically know not to dob our fellow compatriots in but thats not what the OP has done. <br />Thats not to say that im not highly suspicious of this and every thread here on these forums for being either law enforcement psyops, trolls or most common of all plain old simple bullshit

				So I just wanted to chime in on this since there&#039;s been a lot of talk back and forth on what to do what not to do. I&#039;m in the USA so obviously this information is relevant to me here and may not be to you there. As others pointed out, there is never a single occasion that I can imagine where having a discussion with a police office who is investigating anything would ever be of advantageous to someone on these forums. I don&#039;t think a lot of people really realize how the system actually works so this is my effort to point out a few suggestions.<br /><br />Traffic Stop:<br /><br />Do you know how fast you were going? - Would you like to admit to a crime?<br />Where are you coming from? - Are you fleeing the scene of a crime?<br />Do you have anything on you I need to know about? - Would you like to give me your stash now in case I miss it when illegally searching you?<br />Do you mind if I take a look in your car? - I have no probable cause but would really like to get a drug bust in tonight, mind if I scour through your car in hopes of sending you to prison?<br />I&#039;ll have to call the dogs out if you don&#039;t consent. - We don&#039;t really have a fleet of drug dogs patrolling the highway and they alerts are not really admissible as probable cause if you have so much as a hamburger wraper in your car so I would prefer you just let me have at your car without having to go through the bother of getting probable cause.<br /><br />Home Invasion:<br /><br />We&#039;d like to talk to you for a moment if we could. - We&#039;d like to send you and anyone in the house to prison tonight but we don&#039;t have a warrant so please confess to something.<br />Do you mind if we ask a few questions? - We are expert interrogators and would like to give you a chance to incriminate yourself or someone else.<br />Can we come in? - I can&#039;t see your drugs from here.<br />We&#039;ll just come back with a warrant. - Although we know you&#039;ll just flush your stash down the toilet by then so let us in now please.<br />You know it&#039;s a federal crime to lie to a police officer don&#039;t you? - But I forgot to mention it&#039;s not a federal crime to say not a fucking thing to me.<br /><br />These guys are never here to help you. On the off chance you get robbed, stabbed, beaten or abused, calling them for help is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. The police, in this country and in my experience, are nothing more than armed tax collectors for the political elite. When you see those lights go up behind you do you really feel like you are about to be protected and served or do you know that a man with a gun is about to take some of your money from you all the while demanding you be nice to him or he will take away your freedom too?<br /><br />Now the reason I put up this rant was not just to diss on the corruption of the modern police state but to point out something that I really haven&#039;t seen mentioned, while most of us know all of the above it is essential that everyone close to you knows the same. I quiz my girlfriend all the time:<br /><br />&quot;So if they say they just have a few questions what do you say?&quot;<br />&quot;If they are asking about something that happened down the street what do you say?&quot;<br />&quot;When they ask if they can come in for a moment what do you say?&quot;<br />&quot;If they say they just want to look around what do you say?&quot;<br /><br />I choose to remain silent and I don&#039;t consent to any searches.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care if they find it suspicious. I don&#039;t care if it pisses them off. I don&#039;t care if they say they will come back with a fucking tank. This is my freedom here and they are the only people in this country with a vested interest in taking it away. Never in the history of court has a legal defense attorney said to his client &quot;I only wish you had said more to the police.&quot;. <br /><br />Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. <br /><br />I mean how much more clearly do they have to say we are working against you?<br /><br />So talk to the loved ones that are close enough to be connected to you. If you travel with friends and have your stash they NEED to know what you know. Do not ever say anything or consent to anything. This is all old news to anyone that has been worked over by the system before but this whole notion of their being a right way to incriminate yourself to a police officer is just silly. They might not want to put you in prison right then, they might have more important busts to make, you&#039;re not a mind reader though so work with the law of averages and rest comfortably with the fact that saying nothing is always better by the time they do decide they care enough to bust you.<br /><br />Good luck all!<br /><br />

				I just want to give thanks to Kappacino and Razorspyne for speaking sense in this ridiculous thread, I fully echo your sentiments and can&#039;t really think of too much to add.&nbsp; Just to re-iterate to everyone here who isn&#039;t working for LE, never admit to possession and POLITELY DENY ALL KNOWLEGE when police are questioning or interrogating you.&nbsp; NEVER admit anything even if your mate Billy got lucky at some festival with a rookie trainee cop.&nbsp; I honestly can&#039;t believe how many people in this thread are saying that it&#039;s basically a good idea to cooperate with police over petty drug charges, if everyone on SR was like these people they should call it Snitch Road.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever facepalmed as much while reading a thread, lol.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if the original post is sincere or not, but the OP is a dumbass either way, I&#039;m sorry to say.&nbsp; If you&#039;re really such a pushover that you&#039;ll spill the beans over a gram of MDMA you seriously shouldn&#039;t be using this site.&nbsp; I can see also why LE might actually create threads like this, they might be trying to lure idiots and noobs into a false sense of security as far as shaping their view on how police will treat them in questioning.&nbsp; If they can convince some people into thinking that the police will side with them or turn a blind eye if they admit things to them, then they will have a better chance of convicting those people if they ever do get around to questioning them.&nbsp; Think of it as propaganda, it was worth it for the police to make this thread if it leads to even 1 person somewhere admitting to a crime and leading them to a successful conviction&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying that the OP is working for LE but definitely spreading this kind of bullshit helps them out and gives them a better chance of convicting naive punters/having them talk.<br /><br />I think a big problem that LE have with SR is the fact that probably most people don&#039;t admit any knowledge when a package is seized, so most of the time they&#039;re probably irritated that they can&#039;t pin charges or have enough to get a warrant for a raid on someone because they didn&#039;t talk.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I think threads like these could be a lame effort from them to try and lull some people into thinking that they won&#039;t get in trouble if they cooperate, when in reality they&#039;re more likely to have the book thrown at them while some cop gets a promotion.

				Well, that was certainly an interesting read. Is it true? I don&#039;t know and never will. Doesn&#039;t really matter. UK cops are less fuckers than US cops, that&#039;s not to say they&#039;re your friend. Also it&#039;s hard to say how we&#039;d all react to this situation because we weren&#039;t in it.

I don&#039;t think a lot of people really realize how the system actually works so this is my effort to point out a few suggestions.<br /><br />Traffic Stop:<br /><br />Do you know how fast you were going? - Would you like to admit to a crime?<br />Where are you coming from? - Are you fleeing the scene of a crime?<br />Do you have anything on you I need to know about? - Would you like to give me your stash now in case I miss it when illegally searching you?<br />Do you mind if I take a look in your car? - I have no probable cause but would really like to get a drug bust in tonight, mind if I scour through your car in hopes of sending you to prison?<br />I&#039;ll have to call the dogs out if you don&#039;t consent. - We don&#039;t really have a fleet of drug dogs patrolling the highway and they alerts are not really admissible as probable cause if you have so much as a hamburger wraper in your car so I would prefer you just let me have at your car without having to go through the bother of getting probable cause.<br /><br />Home Invasion:<br /><br />We&#039;d like to talk to you for a moment if we could. - We&#039;d like to send you and anyone in the house to prison tonight but we don&#039;t have a warrant so please confess to something.<br />Do you mind if we ask a few questions? - We are expert interrogators and would like to give you a chance to incriminate yourself or someone else.<br />Can we come in? - I can&#039;t see your drugs from here.<br />We&#039;ll just come back with a warrant. - Although we know you&#039;ll just flush your stash down the toilet by then so let us in now please.<br />You know it&#039;s a federal crime to lie to a police officer don&#039;t you? - But I forgot to mention it&#039;s not a federal crime to say not a fucking thing to me.<br /><br />These guys are never here to help you. On the off chance you get robbed, stabbed, beaten or abused, calling them for help is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. The police, in this country and in my experience, are nothing more than armed tax collectors for the political elite. When you see those lights go up behind you do you really feel like you are about to be protected and served or do you know that a man with a gun is about to take some of your money from you all the while demanding you be nice to him or he will take away your freedom too?<br /><br />Now the reason I put up this rant was not just to diss on the corruption of the modern police state but to point out something that I really haven&#039;t seen mentioned, while most of us know all of the above it is essential that everyone close to you knows the same. I quiz my girlfriend all the time:<br /><br />&quot;So if they say they just have a few questions what do you say?&quot;<br />&quot;If they are asking about something that happened down the street what do you say?&quot;<br />&quot;When they ask if they can come in for a moment what do you say?&quot;<br />&quot;If they say they just want to look around what do you say?&quot;<br /><br />I choose to remain silent and I don&#039;t consent to any searches.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care if they find it suspicious. I don&#039;t care if it pisses them off. I don&#039;t care if they say they will come back with a fucking tank. This is my freedom here and they are the only people in this country with a vested interest in taking it away. Never in the history of court has a legal defense attorney said to his client &quot;I only wish you had said more to the police.&quot;. <br /><br />Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. <br /><br />I mean how much more clearly do they have to say we are working against you?<br /><br />So talk to the loved ones that are close enough to be connected to you. If you travel with friends and have your stash they NEED to know what you know. Do not ever say anything or consent to anything. This is all old news to anyone that has been worked over by the system before but this whole notion of their being a right way to incriminate yourself to a police officer is just silly. They might not want to put you in prison right then, they might have more important busts to make, you&#039;re not a mind reader though so work with the law of averages and rest comfortably with the fact that saying nothing is always better by the time they do decide they care enough to bust you.<br /><br />Good luck all!<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^^This!!&nbsp; Couldnt be more accurate&nbsp; , and also outside of the USA&nbsp; :)

It&#039;s been a long time (about a thousand years) since we&#039;ve been able to open up to the LE and expect them to do the decent thing by the small time pusher. If you find a cop who is like that can you let me know please? Because the cops on MY planet all seem like assholes.

Many of you are either very young or, I&#039;m sorry to say, lack intelligence. <br /><br />I encourage everyone to educate themselves as much as possible about the subject because it can cost you your freedom one day. Read this thread, read articles written by experts*, watch documentaries which feature police interrogations.... anything and everything you can get your hands on in order to educate yourselves about what to do and what not to do in these situations.<br /><br />* For example - here&#039;s a number of videos posted by a law professor about why you should not talk to the police (what myself and many others have been saying throughout this thread): http://lawiscool.com/2009/04/16/why-you-should-never-talk-to-the-police/ [clearnet].

Also, if you are at home alone, and you are young, they will take advantage of you. Females especially must never let these assholes in without a SW if alone, as a lot of police abuse young female victims this way. It happens a lot, and when the girl/woman lodges a charge, everything is done to corrupt the investigation. Pure scum.

				Have read the thread with interest. <br />1. Yes the UK Drug Squad do generally say that they are drug squad<br />2. Posting from the UK at this time of year the postal system now requires some form of customs deceleration if sending anything abroad - Not sure what size the package was in this case<br />3. Saying to the LE you bought off SR was not the best idea - Your address will now be registered and who knows what behind the scenes investigations they are making, more importantly even though they let you &#039;off&#039; this will now be whats deemed as &#039;soft information&#039; and can and will be used again if needed<br />4. Anyone know is the vendor about still or disappeared off SR<br />5. I do believe the story however this info can be used if needed . Unsure if this will have implications on applying for a visa etc

				I&#039;ve been reading through these posts and just shaking my head in disbelief.&nbsp; The amount of people that have been posting how the best approach when dealing with LE is to be respectful and honest - and there is a good chance they will just let you go.&nbsp; After all, LE are only interested in going after the dealers.&nbsp; These are all people that are registered on a site that facilitates buying drugs online.&nbsp; So there are either a lot of really clueless morons coming here to buy their drugs or the site/forums are over run with LE posing as users.<br />I don&#039;t think Roger is LE - because I can&#039;t see much of a benefit for LE to go through with this charade.&nbsp; What seems far more likely is Roger is either a disgruntled customer or a competitor of the named vendor - and this is a smear campaign;&nbsp; I mean what better way would there be to have buyers avoid someone like the plague than to tell everyone that person is being investigated by LE?&nbsp; I highly doubt the vendor was arrested, but thanks to Roger they are almost certainly out of business now - as it is unlikely anyone will buy so much as an aspirin from them now.<br /><br />Some key points in the story that triggered my bullshit detector were:&nbsp; I will concede that if you are polite and respectful there is a very slim remote chance that you could &quot;nice&quot; your way out of say a speeding ticket, but if the Drug Unit takes the time to drive all the way to your house and they found so much as a roach on your sidewalk - your ass would be going downtown.&nbsp; Also if the Drug Unit intercepted a package that they confirmed contained drugs and your address was on the package, they would close it back up, deliver it to your doorstop and when you accepted delivery of the package - your ass would be face down on the ground and LE would be storming in every entrance of your property.<br />This comment is hilarious: <br />&quot;Whatever happened that led the police to my door, I don&#039;t know. Most likely I think the seller was busted and my address found at the premises, leading the police to wonder if I had any significant role in this.&quot;<br />If I had to guess, I would say this is what led them to your door:<br />&quot;They said a package had been intercepted containing a significant number of powders (MDMA was mentioned) and it had my address on it.&quot;<br />This comment is probably the most hilarious:<br />&quot;Going on what the police said, I&#039;m supposed to believe this seller had some sort of lapse and sent me a huge bag of drugs I didn&#039;t order.&quot;<br />LMAO - ya that&#039;s a fairly common occurrence with sellers, they have this bad habit of mistakenly sending the wrong customer huge bags of drugs - Merry Christmas!!<br />This is another amusing comment:<br />&quot;I was confident there was very little they could charge me with (or could be bothered to charge me with)&quot;<br />I&#039;m not sure where you were getting this sense of confidence from, because based on your previous statement:<br />&quot;Going on what the police said, I&#039;m supposed to believe this seller had some sort of lapse and sent me a huge bag of drugs I didn&#039;t order.&quot;<br />- it seems to me a huge bag of drugs with your address on it would be quite a bit they could charge you with - and I sure as hell wouldn&#039;t be admitting to buying any more drugs.&nbsp; Not only does that admission self-incriminate you for purchasing the gram - which gives the police a slam dunk conviction, but by admitting to buying the gram you had in your possession you would also be majorly strengthening the police&#039;s case in tying the other huge bag of drugs to you.<br /><br />So this tale is obviously one big swear campaign.<br />As a general rule, how you can tell if LE doesn&#039;t have shit on you - is if they are asking you a lot of questions.&nbsp; If they have a strong case against you - they will lay out all their evidence right in front of you and try to convince you that if you sign a confession they will give you a lighter sentence.

				Not bad for your very first post. You get your first +1. Loved it. Not everyone on this thread agrees with blindly cooperating with PoPo though. Me for 1. AA for 2. Kappacino for 3. And numerous others too numerous to mention. Most of us agree it&#039;s a BAD thing and you have just illustrated (along with us) exactly why.

				the reactions to this post are freakin hilarious, All the anger is either from people who have little if no contact from the law, or are total tossers who do nothing but antagonise the police at every opportunity, and wonder why a simple traffic stop turned into a clusterfuck.You know who you are cause this post will cause your &#039;grass stabin, dole scrounging ass&#039; to go mental at this post. If you are some&nbsp; big time crim with a lot to hide, I understan, I really do.. If your involved with socially detrimental crime, I hope you get caught and buggered by plods baton on your front lawn in front of sheriff John Burnell. Get used to it cause it&#039;s the norm from now on.<br />It&#039;s all relative to your situation and surroundings, so chill the fuck out.<br /><br />so to recap.<br />Watch 24 and only co-operate with the po po if you have full immunity backed and signed by the&nbsp; president of the united states of america <br /><br />JB

				Dude, you said &quot;I admitted to buying the gram and where from,&quot;&nbsp; What?&nbsp; &nbsp;Not cool man.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t admit to shit.&nbsp; Just having your name written down somewhere proves nothing, them trying to&nbsp; get you to think they know more than they do is a ploy, a game, a trap.&nbsp; No warrant, they can&#039;t come in.&nbsp; They wanna talk, then a lawyer can talk instead.&nbsp; Threats of jail time is another ploy.&nbsp; If they already knew then why talk at all.&nbsp; They&#039;d simply have a warrant, then its back to a lawyer again.&nbsp; Admit to nothing.

I&#039;d be very surprised if this was handed down, but that&#039;s beside the point. Whatever the penalty could be you have to ask - what can i do to minimise the chance of punishment. Or what shouldn&#039;t I do. <br /><br />It&#039;s only my opinion but admitting anything to police or letting them into my home without a search warrant would be likely to increase the chances of any court convicting me. <br />So don&#039;t do it.

Then told me to enjoy my weekend, probably because she had a crush on me&nbsp; :-*&nbsp; :-* lol<br /><br />It seemed like the police just weren&#039;t charging people because of the sheer volume of the amount of people getting caught with drugs.<br /><br />I was VERY lucky. <br /><br />Don&#039;t let the OP fool you.<br /><br />Peace out bitches, <br />-SlickSuit

				The problem isn&#039;t will power to not want to self incriminate the problem is that people cannot resist talking back and that&#039;s what fucks them. If you can&#039;t resist the compulsion to speak just start singing or reciting poetry or some shit because it eases your need to speak. Ask for a solicitor and then just sing the Wizard of Oz theme until they get there.

The fact that I was not dealing with any other vendors at the time leads me to believe you&#039;re responsible. That&#039;s pretty much all I&#039;m sure of.<br /><br />You really think a note saying &#039;enjoy the surprise&#039; was going to protect me in any way? And why don&#039;t you use PGP? I&#039;m admitting my complacency here, but handwritten notes and no PGP is far from best practice. There are a couple of reasons why I didn&#039;t message you directly. Besides, you&#039;d not logged in for four days (possibly more, I stopped checking) following my police visit. Can you explain why?<br /><br />I&#039;ve not made a single thing up. I still have the detective&#039;s card. It&#039;s sad that I&#039;m doing this because I&#039;ve had numerous successful transactions from this site (as you know, you&#039;ve seen my stats) and I&#039;ve never had to criticise anyone. I honestly wish I was still in a position to buy from you. But something went seriously wrong here.<br /><br />It&#039;s reached the point where I&#039;m laughing at all these &#039;snitch&#039; comments... what I said was near enough the equivalent of giving &quot;the street&quot; as a source. Who have I possibly compromised other than myself? I had more than the MDMA in the house and I reasoned that I&#039;d rather give that up and take the punishment (which I had a fair idea of, given my experience and reading of the detective) than have them come back, uniformed and whatever, to turn the place over right in the middle of Christmas. <br /><br />I&#039;m perfectly comfortable with my choice and I think some people here are overly determined to portray themselves as hardened career criminals. Well I&#039;m not, and I wasn&#039;t going to start acting like one with two cops in my room. I know I was naive, but my record remains clean.

				There&#039;s no logic to what you&#039;re saying. I gave up information about a compromised package that the police were already more than aware of, through no fault of my own. When I enter an agreement on SR, if it results in detectives coming to my house, I consider it a failure on the vendors part, I&#039;ll take my own course of action (in this case successful, unbelievably so for some) and I&#039;ll make people aware of what happened, if only to let people know and maybe enlighten myself some more because it baffled me. If you can explain who I&#039;ve exposed or made more vulnerable through my actions, other than myself, I&#039;ll take more notice to the low life and grass accusation but thanks for harsh words all the same.

				I cannot believe I fell for this.<br />Roger if what you say is true then this is quite serious and means thecookiejahman is now LE.<br /><br />IF it were true then Silkroad Admin needs to investigate and make sure they have not been infiltrated.<br />But I have looked up thecookiejahman on silkroad and he still has good feedback coming in.<br /><br />It all looks perfectly legit. SR admin would have received complaints about packages not ariving when he was bust.<br />thecookiejahman would be unlikely to come and post in this thread to.<br /><br />So, If people are still getting deliveries then it cannot be LE as they would not be allowed to do this. <br />Unless LE set up lots of false buyer accounts to fake it. But then there would still be legit buyers who would not get anything (unless LE cancelled their orders, which would be pretty obvious to SR admin). <br />The only other possibility would be if LE passed the login details to an informant to take over from thecookiejahman. BUT this would also be illegal as it would be &#039;aiding and abetting&#039; a crime as it is obvious that the informant would be dealing with the help of LE.<br /><br />So Roger, until you have contacted SR admin via SR messages and NOT the forums (and can prove it), then you cannot be believed.<br />If you had contacted the appropriate admin then they would be in a good position to investigate this. More so than anyone on this forum.

				I didn&#039;t expect to see him back selling again - the police told me someone had been busted and I know you can&#039;t take their word on face value, but I just didn&#039;t believe my individual gram, however badly packaged, could have raised the alarm and then been allowed through. A fair few people have agreed that this wouldn&#039;t happen but given the sellers apparent freedom, maybe it did. But then again if he was busted and has managed to somehow re-organize then he wouldn&#039;t admit it, would he?<br /><br />Either way I found myself in a very uncomfortable position thanks to the negligence of the seller. Against my better judgement I&#039;ve removed my 1/5 rating simply because I&#039;ve received numerous packages from other sellers that were equally or less stealthy and they all got 5/5. It was good MDMA as well. I might have to accept it was very bad luck on this occasion, but I&#039;m not apologising for telling my story.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what difference it would have made had I contacted the seller or SR admins. What could be investigated, and resolution could be sought? There&#039;s no way to prove I was visited by the detectives or that I&#039;m not a rival seller intent on sabotage really is there?<br /><br />All I&#039;ll say the story is 100% true and anyone accusing me of &#039;grassing&#039; are talking puerile bullshit. I didn&#039;t grass on anyone and I&#039;m completely sure the consequences would have been worse for me (yet no worse for anyone else) had I refused to talk.

All of us got here because we heard about SR and that you can buy drugs there. Yeah Roger cooperated and gave them info but it wasn&#039;t anything that five minutes at a search engine wouldn&#039;t yield.

				forget what happened with the imaginary police visit he still gave up a vendor packaging details, that is a security breach. which makes me think roger is more than a disgruntled buyer, jealous vendor or a troll and is actually someone who would benefit from throwing a spanner into the works.

				ok yes maybe everyone has been abit &quot;harsh&quot; but the only reason im outraged is the fact that i had to have someone else tell me about you talking shit and &quot;telling your story&quot; behind my back! which would do nothin else but give me a bad review when im fully clueless about it happening.(if thats not a snake i dont know what is!)...so sorry if i didnt hold my tongue! <br /><br />the fact is, ok &quot;if&quot; your story is true then im sorry, im a new vendor and to be honest with you me and my friends have done nothing like this before (from a sellers point of view) everything has been going Sooo well and were really happy with how things are going and then we see this. even after our 100% positive feedback we was thinking naa surely not. <br /><br />if they did come then why didnt you contact us directly (yano the people who sent it to you...) and start asking questions, thats the moral of the story (and i think what everyone else would of done). even before we read your &quot;forum&quot; we have made upgrades to our packaging (now that were gana start doing this seriously) and we will make sure that something like this wont happen, ever again!<br /><br />and Jopular --- we all do deeply fear for your health mate lool youve been watching farr too many cop series i tell you that.....lool...but Honestly now weve not been raided or nothing and i had already wrote a comment on here and roger knows that because he quoted from it. Roger obviously we never wanted cops to come to your door but like you said it has been settled with you not getting anything on your record which is best for you.we have stopped taking orders since new years but that was only becuase weve all got to much work on at the minute to be sending them for some its taken a couple of weeks to arrive.<br /><br />SCHOOL TIME ROGER ---- in future though, firstly ask if they have a warrent (realistically they shouldnt even be at your door unless theyve got one) (thats another reason why we thought you was lieing) and the fact that you said that they still sent it even though they checked it and knew there was some MDMA in it. (they may had done it though just to see if you actually accepted the parcel before they start asking questions) fair/granted.&nbsp; But still its never good to talk to the gavers about anything anyway. Never give them a full explanation, dont give the whole i want my lawyer shiz<br /><br />&nbsp;--- i tell you what roger --- <br /><br />Read up on your &quot;freemans law&quot; for the UK, youll love it, john harris is such a legend. he talks about all of this, how the police just work with your mind and use a totally different language to what we class as &quot;english&quot; just to twist people words and use it against them. honestly mate if your telling us all that youve nevr dealt with the police before then this will educate you soo much with what your government really get up to and why such sites like SilkRoad have to be made just becuase it doesnt fit into their system! <br /><br />trust me when i say to you all, we know our shit! <br /><br />the lesson again, why didnt you just tell us?...alot of us know law and business throughout and obviously all we want it for everyones parcels to arrive successfully so we can buy our herb and you can have an amazing time!!<br /><br />sorry to regret but we will ask you to never use our services again, just for the fact that if &quot;they are watching you now&quot; we dont want nothing to fall back to here affecting us and any of our customers (i dont understand though they should of sent the whole thing parcel of to the lab for testing, finger print scan and all sorts) your story is shady as fook though, let it be the trust or not and it wouldnt matter anyway as not a single fingerprint would even be on there!!) <br /><br />But Either way our apologies again --- for everyone elses piece of mind, ALLL addresses and details are taking straight from SR on to ONE bit of paper, To the printer, Onto the Parcel and Sent straight to you within 24hours. NOOO other details or information is ever kept on anyone!! Even our inbox is totally empty (remember were stoners so were always gana double check our shit!!)<br /><br />Hope to hear from you all soon&nbsp; <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/760664bfe8&nbsp; &nbsp; ----------------&nbsp; &nbsp;heres out site<br /><br />Should be back online in a couple of weeks so keep checking our profile or inbox us!!<br /><br />Much luv<br /><br />TheCookieJahMan<br /><br />&nbsp;8) 8) 8) 8) 8) 8) 8)

If you are some&nbsp; big time crim with a lot to hide, I understan, I really do.. If your involved with socially detrimental crime, I hope you get caught and buggered by plods baton on your front lawn in front of sheriff John Burnell. Get used to it cause it&#039;s the norm from now on.<br />It&#039;s all relative to your situation and surroundings, so chill the fuck out.<br /><br />so to recap.<br />Watch 24 and only co-operate with the po po if you have full immunity backed and signed by the&nbsp; president of the united states of america <br /><br />JB<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re a cretin.<br /><br />Noone here is saying, let&#039;s all go around shouting PIGS and antagonizing police. What we&#039;re advocating is being calm, unreactive, under the radar, but most importantly, not incriminating yourself, and not snitching. <br /><br />The reason we responded angrily is because the advice some people are posting here, which you at least seem partly sympathetic to, will, if followed, lead to real life problems for people. Can you not see that there&#039;s a big difference between your frankly bizarre idea that we&#039;re all up in the face of the police and antagonistic, to what we&#039;re actually saying which is it say as little as possible and to not incriminate yourself? The two approaches are obviously different and the fact that you&#039;re choosing to emphasise the former as if it were what we&#039;re genuinely saying, I think says more about your motives here than ours.<br /><br />And what&#039;s this bollocks about being on the dole? You seem to be creating some fantasies for yourself that are quite preposterous. What on earth are you talking about?<br /><br />Let me just explain to you why you may actually have some form of mental illness. In this thread there are various people saying that you should cooperate with police, and tell them about sr. There are some of us who replied angrily to this by saying, shut the fuck up, that&#039;s ridiculous, you should say as little as possible so as to not incriminate yourself. Then you turn up and say, &quot;you guys on the dole going around antagonizing police turning a traffic stop into a bigger problem&quot; - or something equally retarded and unlettered, but the main point of which is to stress that we are trouble makers of some sort.<br /><br />Now tell me, how is us saying, that you should remain WITHIN YOUR RIGHTS, and either say the bare minimum, and wait for a lawyer, going to turn a &quot;traffic stop into a clusterfuck&quot;? <br /><br />Say you&#039;re caught with coke. They&#039;re already going to charge you for having coke. So saying anything at this point, is just dumb. You may as well stay silent. In most countries, if you are arrested/taken to the police station, you will have to tell them your name, or that is another charge. But that&#039;s all you should say. Then, you wait for your solicitor. What people are saying here is, &quot;if caught, you may as well tell them where you got it from and all about Silk Road&quot;. <br /><br />Can you honestly not see why we&#039;re responding angrily to that? <br /><br />I agree with you that being incredibly disrespectful to the police isn&#039;t going to help your case, and will incur their wrath.. But that isn&#039;t what we&#039;re saying. What we&#039;re saying and have always said, for the fucking thousandth time, is say nothing, don&#039;t incriminate yourself, and wait for your lawyer. <br /><br />Surely this debate is over now?<br /><br />

				Damned straight. + 1 Kappacino. I too think this guy is trying to manipulatively infer we are antagonising cops instead of the other way around. Some of us are xp in these matters and know that LE punish, not reward, opening ^ in the hops that they&#039;re actually human. Like before, there are times when you are best to cooperate with police. This is when they have absolutely everything on you and there is no chance for plausible deniability. Very few situations call for this.<br /><br />If someone approached you in the street with a knife intending to hurt you, would you help them or smash their head in?<br /><br />Wake up. Don&#039;t help them hurt your case.<br /><br />

It wasn&#039;t stealthily packaged, just a baggie taped to a card, with a handwritten note saying &#039;Hope you enjoy the surprise&#039;... a message which confused me at the time and still does. Nevertheless it contained quality class A drugs. This seller was new but was attracting glowing reviews, he was up to about 30 transactions on 100% when I ordered.<br /><br />Whatever happened that led the police to my door, I don&#039;t know. Most likely I think the seller was busted and my address found at the premises, leading the police to wonder if I had any significant role in this.

I was confident there was very little they could charge me with (or could be bothered to charge me with) so I admitted buying the gram and told them where from, educated them somewhat, as they looked on with genuine interest. I reasoned if I denied having anything in the house they could come back and turn the place over so I surrendered the gram. To his credit the PC saw I was respectable and cooperative and agreed to overlook it, so that went down the toilet and they were on their way.

I have been in enough trouble to know that.<br /><br />I call BS to the story once again, and I think that the thread should be deleted so that it stops scaring people. <br /><br />Peace and love, <br />Slick&nbsp; 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Slick has got this covered. I&#039;ve read all 13 pages of this thread, and it seems like utter bullshit. The cops acted extremely unprofessionally if your story is true. I doubt, even in the UK, that the cops acted so dumb. I call complete bullshit on this story. I doubt any legit smart vendor would hand write&nbsp; a note. If ever caught, handwriting samples are admissible in court. If they actually intercepted such a large shipment, they would obtain a search warrant and your ass would be in prison mate. <br /><br />Please, go troll somewhere else. If LE, fuck off and stop fucking peaceful people&#039;s lives up and do your fucking job.

				The pigs would love to get a bust even with a single gram of mdma . A gram to a pig is a good amount to make a pigs day . The pigs would be telling other pigs that they made a good bust and the guy they spoke to admitted it was his and he got it sent in the mail . Shit like this dosent happen every day man . I dont know if you guys have or havent been busted before but the first thing a lawyer will say to you is have you spoken to the pigs (police) about this problem ?&nbsp;

				The police in the UK can be very different from those you encounter in more &#039;shoot first ask questions later countries&#039;. Reading the OP again just now it doesn&#039;t sound all that unbelievable to be honest, I used to have a friend in the Met and he would often tell us stories about confiscating small personal quantities of drugs and disposing of them to avoid the paperwork and unnecessary disruption to someones life over an 1/8th of hash. I still wouldn&#039;t have offered up the gram as claimed by the OP though but if this is true I can understand where the motivation may have come from to be up front with them, UK police can actually be reasonable at times, something I am yet to experience in Australia where they are mostly just a bunch of power trippin&#039; wankers. <br /><br />Still the best advise always will be do not talk to the police!

I have posted so many times in this thread I should get commission. So this is it for me. I have answered everyone&#039;s questions lol. So many times. And I&#039;m always right. So by rights this thread will just drift away I&#039;m assuming. <br /><br />Probably no need to lock it as it will disappear on its own. I just want to give a shout out to Raz. He posted some really good think-pieces in here. My far the best posts were his. Well done my friend. Well done. You, sir, are a hero.<br /><br />As for samesame, yeah true, but I said that myself. UK different to US and AU. To everyone else who posted..... yeah, you&#039;re got too I guess, don&#039;t be left out. Keep your chin up, work hard and go to uni.
