				Hi,<br /><br />I am a new vendor who has just recieved an order from a user who has never ordered anything on the site before. Their account is recently created and I am unsure as to whether I can trust them. If they put money in escrow and ship the product to them, is it likely they will simply claim the product has never arrived and refuse to pay me? If this does happen what can I do about it?<br /><br />Thanks for the help.

				They could do as you have suggested. Definitely use the escrow service, however if you have over 35 transactions you can request a buyer with low or non-existent transaction stats finalises the order early.<br /><br />Some buyers will offer refunds on a sliding scale, so 0 to 5 transactions gets 0% refund, 6-10 gets 33% 10-20 66% and over 20 transactions gets a full refund. These are examples, set your own scale.<br /><br />You can refuse an order however new vendors and new buyers all have to start somewhere. As a new buyer however i would look to only do business with established vendors in order to build up a transaction history/reputation before risking my BTC on a new vendor.<br /><br />Perhaps get involved withe the buyer and sound them out over PM first.<br /><br />

				Send them a message that they will have to finalize early. Also tell them you will be shipping with a tracking number so no refunds unless the package gets snaged by customs. The worst is they say NO and you cancel the order.

				This is so stupid!! You were new once too. We all were. Stay within escrow and ship that shit. Keep the dcn, you will need it. Send it to the trader after you ship. Easy.

				My problem is I am too new a seller to ask people to finalise early, otherwise I would just ask them to do that. If they claim the order has never arrived will I have no way to claim the money? Also they ordered the largest amount I have available to sell which makes me slightly suspicious. It&#039;s annoying because I haven&#039;t made many sales yet and would really like the business, but I don&#039;t want to lose out on quite a large amount of money.

				Look I hate finalize early. I had to do it on half of my orders. But for the first few I can understand. I wouldn&#039;t sell a huge amount to them and if you stay in escrow make sure you have a tracking number. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much 99.9% of Silk road transactions come out good for the vendor and customer.

I take the side of the customer when it comes to FE but in this case I would just walk away. Tell them your situation. You don&#039;t want to make them Finalize Early because you are a new vendor but since they have a 0 for purchasing stats they should look else where for MDMA. I would also take down the listings for 2g and 5g... just until you have at least 10 to 15 transactions under your belt.

				^^^all good suggestions. Just stick to small orders until you get some time under your belt, Once you have a good rep built up you will definitely have more pull in asking them to FE and resolving disputes

				Thanks for the advice guys, really appreciated. I&#039;ve decided to reject the order for now since there is no way I am willing to lose that much money. I&#039;m also going to remove my 5g listing until I have some more orders completed.<br /><br />I am currently finding business very slow - I got my first order within hours of creating my seller&#039;s account but since then I&#039;ve had none at all besides a few messages inquiring about bulk amounts. I guess I just need to wait for people to try me out then eventually I will build up a solid reputation and my userbase will increase.<br /><br />Well cheers guys, you&#039;ve all been very helpful. This place really does have an amazing community.

				If the buyer is asking for like 100 grams of MDMA or something biggish, I&#039;d direct them to another vendor if your starting off.<br /><br />A gram is fair play. I bough a gram of E here but had to finalise early.<br /><br />Everyone has to start off with 0 transactions.<br /><br />Many vendors ask for ten transaction, and look to see what you spent (buying ten ebooks would not work)<br /><br />Then you will be in escrow all the time unless you suddenly hop to asking for 50 grams of coke when all you bought was a gram before.<br /><br />No refunds on buyers with less than ten transaction is also done.<br /><br />Many vendors buy here also and some started off buyers and now sell.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Hey sounds like you made the right choice in cancelling the order. As others have suggested you should participate in the forums, offer some product samples to forum members with over 100 posts who will then leave reviews for you. Introduce yourself on the rumour mill and products offered threads. A good business will take time to build up, but patience will be rewarded.
