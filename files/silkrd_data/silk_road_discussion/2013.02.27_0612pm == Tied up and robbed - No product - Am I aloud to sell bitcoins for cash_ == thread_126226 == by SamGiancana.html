				Hey guys, I got door kicked in, me and girlfriend were tied up and robbed. I lost all my product and money because I was dumb enough to keep it in the open and dumb enough to think it would never happen to me - heres a lesson to vendors - if you read this keep your product in different spots, not all in the same box etc (or do what I have done now and get a stash house, rent a basement out of somewhere etc), and most of all dont trust your friends - they will get jealous and tip someone off for a cut of something. <br /><br />I&#039;ve put my vendor account in vacation mode while I try to scratch up money to get my product back up.<br /><br />That aside, am I able to sell bitcoins for cash with western union or is this against the rules of SR?<br />I have a bunch that I need to get some money for.<br />Let me know - thanks!<br />

				It&#039;s not against the rules at all as long as you already have a vendor account!&nbsp; So sorry to read about what happened to you and your girlfriend.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I wonder how the people knew you had drugs in there ... or maybe they just hit you randomly?&nbsp; <br /><br />So scary ... hope you both are doing okay physically.

				If the transaction is below a certain threshold (might be $1k) then you can have them send it to you using a &quot;secret question / secret answer&quot; instead of an ID.&nbsp; They just need to be sure to tell the Western Union agent that they are sending to someone without an ID, and for the WU agent to please mark that in their system.&nbsp; Then you&#039;ll need the person to tell you what the secret question / secret answer was so you can provide it when you go to pick up the cash.<br /><br />

				its always a good idea to have seperation on your important things, not to have all your eggs in one basket. a good piece of advice is to have a diversion safe (no not like the coke cans that open up) but like one of those 20 dollar cheapos that look like a little brief case u can get at walmart. keep like a couple oz of weed some cash and what ever in there to make it look like thats the jack pot n to make robbers think no need to keep looking around. while u could have all your real valuables somewhere a robber wouldnt take the time to look. the little case you could even just give to the robbers and more than likely theyll be satisified to have got the &quot;safe&quot; and dip. maybe get a dog too bacause anything that gives u a warning that something is about to pop off is good and a lot of people have a wierd fear of dogs. so that in itsself may be a deterant to getting robbed.

				Just make sure they check the box for no I&#039;d. Otherwise even with passcode they would still have to show ID. <br /><br />Good luck with getting back on your feet. <br /><br />Never trust people. Keep your business secret.

				I hope that you opened a separate account to sell your coins! Especially if you&#039;re going to use WU, that&#039;s the quickest way to get yourself in loads of trouble. Even if you don&#039;t have to show ID, if you sell them to the wrong person (LE), all they would have to do is get camera footage from where you collect, and then wait until you sell your product again, and bingo! Maybe I&#039;m over thinking it, but I would definitely not do it!

				Sorry to hear man, i dont know what kinda dealer you are, but if your fuckin with weed on qps or more, def consider video surveilllance and arming your selves even if a ex con esp if your location has a self defense law. In some states even ex cons can have a home defense shotgun (texas does where im from but no longer)... you honestly cant trust no body these days. People that you sell to regularly will someway introduce one of his homeboys to you or one your associates next thing you know their settin u up or what not, what out for them hoes too. You can trust girls to an extent unless your eally know em. Other wise just remember that in this drug life esp hard drugs girls will fuck you over just for a high or cuz the next person convinced her. Once again , sad to hear

				Man that sucks, sorry bro must be aweful. I would even consider moving since the chance of it happening again is reasonable. Then again it could be something fucked up like your dealer organising it he steals all your stuff then starts selling it back to you again.&nbsp; If not, since only a couple of your friends knew, get a firearm and tell them you now sleep with it loaded under a pillow, actually show them so they will spread the info and they might think twice about coming in.

				Firstly, I&#039;m sorry to hear if this really happened.<br /><br />Secondly, every single thing about everything you have ever done, from your images to your review thread to your vendor page (and its &#039;quotes&#039;) to your story to your fan count/feedback ratio to your time here to everything else etc etc screams scam. You also have a quote of a feedback from another vendor&#039;s page with the username of the person leaving the feedback. Maybe vendors can see things buyers can&#039;t, but if not, you couldn&#039;t have known who left it, not to mention your 1KG listing has 0 feedback. <br /><br />Perhaps your feedback is what is most ridiculous. Almost every single one has signs of being fake. Not to mention there are people within the past few hours FEing (which you say you never request) for large amounts of product (that you supposedly no longer have) from an account that is supposed to be in vacation mode. <br /><br />I could be wrong of course but even if I wanted to believe you, literally zero things add up. To me this is as obvious as GilbertWallMVP.<br /><br />Anyway, think this through a little bit better next time. I&#039;m sorry if it actually happened, but I&#039;m 99.9999999% sure this is all made up. The feedback is just silly.<br /><br />Godspeed to anybody who buys. I truly hope you can prove me wrong.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey guys, I dont believe this guy is a scammr at all.&nbsp; I have an order in escrow with him and he provided the tracking number and it is indeed en route to my address.&nbsp; I would have to say that I believe him in this case.&nbsp; I was thinking about buying coins to help him out and to save a little bit of money on rates but on second thought I dont think I will do that.&nbsp; Who knows if this is a reverse law enforcement sting.&nbsp; If you use your real name to send him funds they can definitely track you down and prove that you were the recipient of the package etc.&nbsp; I got worried because of how fast my order was placed in transit and how fast I was provided a tracking number.&nbsp; Is that legal for US gvt to set up a an out of country operation sending drugs to people over this site to harvest names/addresses?&nbsp; I even thought about the fact that they could use the tracking numbers to check the IP addresses of the people checking the status of a pack sent by them and its another way they can prove you had knowledge of the package.&nbsp; Now this whole got robbed and selling BTC through western union can tie you into the whole equation by having a snap shot of you on some camera somewhere sending money via WU.&nbsp; I have a couple of places that I do WU transactions at that do not have cameras so I wouldn&#039;t have to worry about that.&nbsp; I must say though the speed in which my transaction was processed sketched me out.&nbsp; Hopefully he is just an awesome vendor like all the reviews are saying. <br /><br />I may be extremely paranoid and I think a lot of us are, and for good reason.&nbsp; This is not a joke and we are playing with our freedom.&nbsp; I have to say my gut is going with the fact that he really did fall on hard times and is just trying to quickly cash out his BTC so he can by more product so he can continue vending.&nbsp; It sure would be a ton of work to set up a ton of schill accounts and load BTC onto each of them and then pretend and make reviews and feedback from all those accounts. I think Sam is legit and the fact that I have a tracking number en route to my delivery address is also another reason why I am pretty sure this guy is for real.&nbsp; I think the reviews are real and that he is an up and coming star on here.

				Had a buddy who got his door kicked in by a not-so-intelligent crew of LE not too long ago.&nbsp; They ran across all 5 of his safes in good time, but failed when they slowed down the search there.&nbsp; Luckily he only keeps crystals and important documents in his safes - there was close to $10k in illicit substance mylar-sealed on the shelf in his kitchen w/ all the spices.<br /><br />I&#039;m a big fan of diversion safes :)

				The more I read, the more uneasy I become.&nbsp; First of all, if you got your door kicked and had all of your product taken WHY do you still have your drug listings up?&nbsp; In the last two days since you allegedly got robbed, at least 7 people have ordered your products (which you no longer have) and have finalized early.&nbsp; By my math, that is right around $3500USD that people have given you in the last two days for product that you&#039;ve stated you no longer have.&nbsp; If those are real people and real sales, that is a lot of money for them to blindly hand over and I&#039;m hoping you do right by them once you get your product again.&nbsp; While it&#039;s relatively early, I haven&#039;t seen anyone complaining about lost packages yet but I don&#039;t see any other motive for lying about a robbery.&nbsp; If you are lying, then you&#039;re trying to offload your BTC as fast as possible to run into the sunset.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t lying, pull down your listings until you get back on your feet.

				Hi everyone thanks for all the advice / condolences.<br />I was just alerted by someone who let me know people are suspicious of me scamming - this is not the case I have nothing to hide.<br />I haven&#039;t asked a single person to FE for me, past customers who are happy with my service have gone above and beyond and done this themselves.<br />I had my account on vacation mode for 2 days after it happened, a few users with orders I sent a message to explaining I could cancel their order or if they wouldn&#039;t mind waiting.<br />I JUST got several orders out today since this happened, I have 4 tracking numbers I sent out this morning to people who ordered tracking.<br />If a mod is able to go in my account and look at sent messages hopefully they can verify this, if not I have messaged the people if they wouldn&#039;t mind chiming in on this thread that I sent the info.<br />It does seem like an elaborate story but it is the complete truth. I hope people who have receieved orders from me start chiming in on this thread.<br />I have even had a few people offer to send me bitcoins once they heard the story, and I rejected it as I do not believe in receiving anything for free.<br />Regardless, you are NEVER asked / required to FE, I have even turned down offers of people saying they would FE that it would not matter, and I have yet out of all my orders even standard shipping to not get delivered - 100 % success rate.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t call me out as a scammer just give it some time, or even throw a small .25 order at me and you&#039;ll see I am the real deal.<br />Thanks for everyone who has supported me - this has been a very shitty experience and I like what the person above me said about treating this as my job - I should be driving to a different location to fulfill my orders every day and have no ties to my house. I didn&#039;t think I was at the point of being large enough to be targetted for something like this but I guess I was wrong.

I think Sam is legit and the fact that I have a tracking number en route to my delivery address is also another reason why I am pretty sure this guy is for real.&nbsp; I think the reviews are real and that he is an up and coming star on here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I had to smile when you said how fast you got the tracking number - I take pride in how fast I work for people willing to business with me.<br />I have made many purchases on SR before I got a vendor account - and I was very frustrated with how slow some of them did business.<br />I wouldn&#039;t be too worried about LE targetting the buyer to be honest... I mean they can find someone on the street buying drugs any day of the week - it&#039;s the dealers / vendors they are after if you ask me, but not to say you shouldn&#039;t have your guard up and be as secure as you can all the time. <br /><br />To be completely honest guys I am a little shocked at how nice the reviews are on my vendors page - I guess in some cases good service can outweigh product or price, because I am sure many other vendors are on here who could have my same quality of product or even beat my prices overseas, but people are willing to pay more for good service and that&#039;s what I promise to give them after experiencing first hand some really crappy service on here.<br />

First of all, if you got your door kicked and had all of your product taken WHY do you still have your drug listings up?&nbsp; In the last two days since you allegedly got robbed, at least 7 people have ordered your products (which you no longer have) and have finalized early.&nbsp; By my math, that is right around $3500USD that people have given you in the last two days for product that you&#039;ve stated you no longer have.&nbsp; If those are real people and real sales, that is a lot of money for them to blindly hand over and I&#039;m hoping you do right by them once you get your product again.&nbsp; While it&#039;s relatively early, I haven&#039;t seen anyone complaining about lost packages yet but I don&#039;t see any other motive for lying about a robbery.&nbsp; If you are lying, then you&#039;re trying to offload your BTC as fast as possible to run into the sunset.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t lying, pull down your listings until you get back on your feet.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />These people who FE&#039;d and ordered tracking received their tracking today.<br />I never asked a single one of them to do it.<br />I did take my listings down for 2 days, I am so low on product right now, I had enough in my bank account to grab an ounce of coke / meth, and I was fronted another ounce of meth from my dealer which I still haven&#039;t paid for.<br />I have no reason to make this story up. <br /><br />Just to re-iterate, do not FE if you are uneasy about things at all!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thank you for responding to my post, Sam.&nbsp; Like I said, I didn&#039;t really see a motive to lie about a robbery aside from it being an excuse to screw people out of orders they&#039;ve placed and it didn&#039;t look like you were doing that.&nbsp; I was just pointing out some things that people might view as red flags but you did the right thing and answered them accordingly.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t noticed your postings being taken down but if you did take them down while you were out of product, good on you.&nbsp; I hope you didn&#039;t take offense to what I wrote, I was just doing some due diligence to satisfy my own curiosity as well as to help address anything that potential buyers might not have thought up.&nbsp; I really feel for you in regards to the robbery, I&#039;ve had someone temporarily steal a car I loved and a lot of stuff out of it so I can relate to the violated feeling you must be experiencing at this point.. although, yours would be to a much greater extent being that it was your home that was broken into.&nbsp; Like several people above have said, you need to take measures to protect yourself and your property now.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how difficult it is to get a firearm for self-defense in Canada but that&#039;d be my first choice.&nbsp; Most of the time, you don&#039;t even need to fire it to dissuade someone from robbing you.&nbsp; Do what you think is best to protect yourself.<br /><br />Like another person stated above, you should take a lot of precautions with the BTC&gt;WU listings you have up.&nbsp; It&#039;d be best to do it from a different vendor account than the one you currently use but since that ship has sailed, I hope you at least sent someone trusted who isn&#039;t you to pick up your money.&nbsp; It&#039;d be too easy for LE to take this opportunity to use this listing to set up a sting operation or, at the very least, get intel on you.&nbsp; Take scout&#039;s advice and make sure to be smart about it, I&#039;d hate to see you get popped after getting robbed.&nbsp; The fact that you took the time to address the concerns I presented here goes a long way, I wish you the best of luck in the future.&nbsp; Take The Advocate up on his offer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah I definitely am going to re-think this western union thing now....<br />Not sure how I should approach it, and I have no idea how I could convince someone to go collect money for me, why would someone even bother doing that for another person without asking a million questions.<br />It&#039;s definitely fair to be cautious on this site, I just don&#039;t want to be labelled as something and deter people from doing business with me based on false judgement. I will continue to prove myself here though!<br />Seriously though, as a community you have all been very helpful.<br /><br />Security wise, I still haven&#039;t quite figured out what the answer is. I didn&#039;t really want a life of a loaded gun under my pillow etc, but I guess you need to look reality in the face when something like this happens. I&#039;ve already gone and rented out a basement where I am going to keep my things now.<br />It was just a big wakeup call, I felt the most bad for my girlfriend, who had her laptop and purse / valuable stolen / is scared to even walk out to her car now, or go to sleep without me. I guess you do shit like this and you attract shit for attention. Learning experience though - could have been a lot worse, and it is a kick in the ass to straighten some weak links up.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I feel for you and her man, I really do.&nbsp; That must have been quite the experience, especially if they were armed.&nbsp; Did you get a good look at any of them?&nbsp; Do you have any idea who they were or how they found out about it?&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming you probably didn&#039;t report the electronics or any of the legit stuff as being stolen due to the fact that it was done mainly for your drugs and money.&nbsp; As far as worrying about having a loaded gun, I know the culture in Canada is different but I&#039;ve always had a handgun for home protection even when I wasn&#039;t involved in a shady lifestyle.&nbsp; As it is now, I am simply a buyer and all I have at any given time is for personal use and only one person where I live even knows I use but I still have a gun for home protection.&nbsp; I refuse to be a victim for some lowlife who is looking to steal from me and I sure as hell won&#039;t let anyone harm my family.. that just isn&#039;t going to happen.&nbsp; Firearms are valuable tools and can be a great equalizer, even if you never have to fire it.&nbsp; You got off lucky this time, things could have turned out much worse so just chalk it up to a learning experience and use it to your benefit from here on out.&nbsp; I wish you the best of luck.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They came in covered in black with masks, I recognized none of them, there was only 2 of them, and all they had was batons, but that&#039;s enough when you are asleep and awoken with them over top of you.<br />They instantly tied us up, didnt even have to ask me where my shit was, money was sitting right there on a desk, and they knew exactly what they were looking for. I havent even ate any food for 2 days really, because I am eating my brain trying to figure out who was behind it.<br />You&#039;d be surprised how little people knew about my operation - let alone would be the type of person to pull off something like this. It just makes me lose my appetite with frustration trying to find that Eureka moment where I think of a conversation I had that was a little off with someone who might be trying to find out information etc...<br />Basically im going fucking crazy trying to get to the bottom of it and I need to just let it go but I&#039;m still in the same house in the same room so its a little nerve racking, I feel like I want to move out asap, but I don&#039;t have the paper for that right now.

				+1 The Advocate. Hope good karma comes your way soon. I had my place broken into once before. I honestly didnt think anyone had the balls to do it, I was a little too comfy in my surronding. They waited until I was gone though. Poor, broke bastards stole my clothes lol. They managed to get some nice bud off of me tho that they had no clue was there. Luckily I had all kinds of spots in my place to where they basically got nothing....Well, compared to what they could of got of course. Gotta beat them streets!!!! :)

				I think it is cool that you asked if it was OK to sell your BTC when you were not sure.

Remember it is not illegal to receive money. The only problem is if they know who they did it for. So a stranger would be good if you can find (pay) a trustworthy stranger to do it, lol. Too, bad wearing a ski mask would not look good :-)&nbsp; Apparently, the sender need only know what State it is going to rather than a more specific location. So a sting at the pickup spot would be difficult for LE. Might not want to use the same spot more than once. It also seems only some WU locations pay in cash. Might also be good to send tumbled (not SR Btc anymore) Btc from a different account than your vendor account.

				SamG,<br /><br />Not only would I invest in a gun and get the word out about it, get one of those floor mount door braces to give yourself time.&nbsp; Maybe mount some other door hardware as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone also suggested video surveillance; get a motion activated tamper proof dome... mount it in plain sight and tell your people it saves the recording remotely.&nbsp; One camera for the door, one for the parking lot etc.&nbsp; (the further the distance you make them wear ski-masks, the more risk they take)<br /><br />If my town was small (I imagine this is feasible):&nbsp; I&#039;m no hacker... but just like War-Driving looks for access points (rig up an antenna to a laptop and drive around looking for routers/networks)... maybe you can Reverse-Wardrive; drive around with an access point (big antenna attached) looking for end-users (your girlfriend&#039;s MAC address).&nbsp; Obviously leave the network open... no WEP/WPA.&nbsp; Maybe your AP even supports some sort of MAC filtering; set it to only allow your girlfriend&#039;s MAC address.&nbsp; I&#039;d do this during peak hours.&nbsp; Her MAC is probably still saved in your/her router&#039;s history.&nbsp; You will have to work out how to power the AP since you can&#039;t plug it into a wall though. (I imagine someone here can help you with this setup)&nbsp; Even if your town isn&#039;t small, go and Reverse-Wardrive residences of suspected culprits.&nbsp; Do it at different hours.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />And check the pawnshops... possibly they pawned it.&nbsp; Maybe the people that have the laptop now aren&#039;t the same ones that stole it, but they may lead you closer to the suspects.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m just spit-balling here...&nbsp; Sorry to hear of your misfortune.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126226.msg866727#msg866727">Quote from: jailbirdslanger on February 28, 2013, 02:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">... what out for them hoes too.
