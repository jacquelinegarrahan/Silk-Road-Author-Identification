				Title: <strong>8 Common Silk Road Myths - Know Your Marketplace! </strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Myth 1. Silk Road is the Ebay of Drugs <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if the Gawker article was the first time a journalist used this stupid phrase, but it&#039;s been repeated by stupid people ever since. Ebay is an auction site while Silk Road is an escrow trading site which is fundamentally different. It&#039;s often compared to Amazon too which is closer perhaps, but Silk Road actually makes a profit. <br /><br />Myth 2. Silk Road is a Private, Hidden, Underground Website.<br /><br />No, it&#039;s a public website where anybody is welcome. It runs on TOR to anonymize communication, not for hiding the site or restricting access. <br /><br />Myth 3. Silk Road Sells Child Pornography &amp; Guns.<br /><br />Although Silk Road started with guns, turns out it&#039;s more profitable to sell stuff that feels good man. Journalists often seem to lump Silk Road in with the rest of the &quot;dark web&quot; and all the evil it may contain. The fact is Silk Road does not permit anything which is intended to cause harm. In terms of the dark web, Silk Road is more aligned with the activists and anti-censorship freedom fighters than the murderers and deviants. <br /><br />Myth 4. Silk Road is More Dangerous Than Street Drug Dealing.<br /><br />Reporters and police keep perpetuating this myth, that since you are buying anonymously you just don&#039;t know what you might get. The fact is, you don&#039;t really know what you get on the street either, but here a crowd-sourced quality control system and a strong community of drug testers mean that Silk Road may possibly be the safest way to acquire high quality, high purity, illegal drugs ever in history. Deal with it.<br /><br />Myth 5. Silk Road is Massive<br /><br />It may be the most popular online drug marketplace, and 7000+ products is nothing to sneeze at. The value of BTC is undoubtedly tied to Silk Roads daily trade volume. But with an estimated revenue of $22M in 2012, Silk Road represents 0.007% of the 320 Billion dollar global drug trade. It&#039;s notoriety comes from it&#039;s novelty, not from it&#039;s size. In all likelihood, Silk Road is a single instance of web software on a single server. <br /><br />Myth 6. Silk Road Has Already Been Busted and is Now Run by the Government to Monitor You<br /><br />Get your tin foil out people because this one is a fucking thigh slapper. Often spouted by the serially paranoid user who goes around revealing this high conspiracy but still uses the site to buy their anti-anxiety medication. Calm your tits people, while police selling drugs for convictions is not unknown it is, in a broad sense, illegal in most countries. It would be unconstitutional to pursue as an enforcement strategy. It wouldn&#039;t even get past an ethics committee for public health and safety reasons, so relax .. the day the police find the server is the day the marketplace stops trading. <br /><br />Myth 7. Dread Pirate Roberts is Actually a Hot Blonde IT Anarchist Girl<br /><br />You&#039;ve heard this one right? I like to think this one is true, just because I can. Call me, DPR. We could be good together. <br /><br />Myth 8. Silk Road is Invincible <br /><br />This myth is the communities fault. Whenever someone is busted or a successful law enforcement operation takes place, everyone is quick to defend the road and blame the vendor or user. Unfortunately Silk Road is illegal, and one day this party will be over. Even if the software or the hardware never fail, people usually do. But know this - you cannot kill an idea. For this reason, there will always be a &quot;silk road&quot; just as there will always be an &quot;anonymous&quot;. From here on in, it&#039;s a technology arms race and Dread Pirate Roberts is presently in the lead. <br /><br />Have you heard a Silk Road myth? Share yours in this thread. <br /><br />- TheBusiness

				Heh that was a throwaway stab at Amazon, but that company is well known for running everything at a loss in order to maintain it&#039;s position as #1 retailer and keep it&#039;s share price up. <br /><br />(clearnet link for details : <br />http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/26/amazon_profits_they_don_t_exist_but_the_company_keeps_on_keeping_on.html ) <br /><br />In terms of ratio of profit (%) to revenue Silk Roads will be higher than Amazons.

				Thank you for posting that, I&#039;m reading through the article now.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That&#039;s just staggering. It means that Wall Street is on board with an Amazon business strategy that doesn&#039;t require it to actually make profits as long as it increases sales volumes. And if you&#039;re in any line of business where you compete with Amazon—and Amazon is in a lot of businesses, and seems to get into new ones each year—that should terrify you.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br /><br />That is just insane.&nbsp; The fact that this company exists and continues to grow just demonstrates how ass-backwards economics works these days.&nbsp; Thanks big brother, this is working so well for us.&nbsp; &nbsp; ::)

				Nice list :)<br /><br />I can tell you why it is compared to eBay and not Amazon though.&nbsp; SR is actually much closer to the eBay model - i.e. nobody buys anything from eBay (or SR), it is simply a mechanism for bringing buyers and sellers together and eBay (SR) takes a commission for facilitating the meeting.&nbsp; Also feedback and ratings are left for the *people* (i.e. the vendors) rather than just the product.&nbsp; <br /><br />c.f. Amazon, which is a place you can physically purchase from and feedback is about the product only.<br /><br />If you want to be totally accurate, Silk Road is like the &#039;buy it now&#039; option of eBay.&nbsp; But &quot;Silk Road: the Buy it Now Option of eBay of Illegal Drugs&quot; just doesn&#039;t make for a snappy headline :)<br />

				Good post though I don&#039;t necessarily believe it isn&#039;t a honeypot.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard several theories on why it can&#039;t be as in its illegal or they wouldn&#039;t run something that has the potential to hurt people.<br /><br />I think these things are negated by known honeypot stories of the past.<br /><br />I think the most compelling evidence that isn&#039;t a honeypot is it seems as though none of the big players disappear wither it be vendors or staff.<br /><br />Well vendors disappear because they usually go scammer or quit but you know if they were busting people I think it would be at a more alarming rate. <br /><br />I&#039;ll use supertrips as an example he is the most unorganized, low stealth, giant vendor and he is still in business somehow.&nbsp;

				Great job on this list OP.<br /><br />Myth 2 is certainly the most important and often overlooked. In my opinion PGP should be required for all communications but hey I just don&#039;t want to end up in jail. People are so naive, especially on the forums. The law is 100% undeniably positively combing the forums and main page for any slip up. BE CAREFUL.

Given the conservative bias in some of the estimates for individual substances, a turnover of around $400 billion per annum is considered realistic. This figure can be compared to estimates of more than $500 billion which are based solely on the average of minimum and maximum prices in the United States.&quot; <br />Source: United Nations Drug Control Program, &quot;Economic and Social Consequences of Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking,&quot; Technical Series No. 6, 1998, p. 55 </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>How much the drug industry is worth today is anybody&#039;s guestimation, I&#039;d say it&#039;s at least doubled.

Most people don&#039;t know where any of this stands in the real world, it&#039;s all virtual til it gets to your door. The fear part of the reaction is simply caution. No one, and i mean NO ONE, believed this shit was real the first day they got here. Everyone had that same hesitance, and heavy skepticism. The problem with that is, the longer you&#039;re here, the more comfortable with everything you become. What was once completely alien and impossible has become second nature. It&#039;s easy to hate on the newbies, sure they&#039;re annoying, but just like anyone else who was here their first month, their curious, cautious and a little scared. That&#039;s why the newbie section is great when the spam is under control. All you can do is modulate annoyance like that, there&#039;s no way to eradicate it
