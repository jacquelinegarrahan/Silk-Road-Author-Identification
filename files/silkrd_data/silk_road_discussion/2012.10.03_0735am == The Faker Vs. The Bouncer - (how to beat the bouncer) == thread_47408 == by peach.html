				Hello gals and guys,<br />This time I would like to share you a few tips about how to use the fake IDs.<br />Most of my clientele are youngsters who want to get into clubs and bars.<br /><br />I am making this public post because I am being bombarded with questions regarding to the quality of my IDs and they ask if the IDs will be working in-state in nightclubs.<br />The short answer is: it depends on you.<br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t satisfy you, let me expand on that.<br />I have a vast clientele and I have adults with very serious shit using them every day bypassing TSA checkpoints at the airport, opening bank accounts and PO Boxes. None of them have a problem, and they are recurrent customers as well. This is the testimony of the quality of my IDs.<br />All the security features are there, and visually it is indistinguishable from a real one if you put them side by side.<br />I have raving reviews from military veterans and from other people with experience making fake IDs.<br /><br />Ironically youngsters don&#039;t seem to have a consistent result. You know why? Because you don&#039;t really know how to handle yourself, your body language betrays you.<br />I used to work as a bartender, and I barely looked at the IDs, I directly spurted: &quot;this is a really good fake&quot;.<br />I had cases of idiots replying &quot;thanks&quot;, but normally, even if they are not that dumb, guilty people act guilty.<br />What I am really looking is not at the IDs, these days the replicas are extremely good and you truly can&#039;t tell a real one from a really good fake, it is much easier to read your reaction to the accusation.<br /><br />Everyone is different, but the signs are consistent. A long silence, lowering your face, scratching yourself, scratching your head, stuttering, hesitating, overreacting and/or just being FROZEN (you will not notice it because you are all nervous, but a second for you, is an eternity for me)<br />If an honest person gets accused for something that is false, they react as honest people. They either laugh it off or they react offended if I insist (getting into the &quot;wait... are you being serious?&quot; mood state), but the honest offended reaction is gradual, not explosive like the guys who are nervous for being busted.<br /><br />The accusation itself is the test, and entering immediately into the &quot;oh fuck, fuck, fuck, I got caught&quot; mental state just exposes yourself.<br />That mental state is translated directly into your body language, and bouncers who are well experienced on bullshit they are pretty good at reading them as well.<br /><br />Another thing is that the State guidelines encourages bouncers to ban the access to anyone they *suspect* to be underage, even if they have no proof of that. A case in point is my cousin who used to have a hard time getting into nightclubs because she has a cute baby face, even when she was almost thirty. Bouncers were telling her that she was underage and that her ID was fake, and she would get really pissed. Sometime she was allowed in, and sometimes she wasn&#039;t. But one thing was sure, she always got her ID back. And that is another sign, if they give back the ID is because they really can&#039;t tell if your ID is real or not. If they were certain that it was a fake, it would have been retained or cut in half.<br /><br />Learning to act is harder than you think, you must train yourself to be able to handle yourself. Most kids are too overconfident about themselves, and their attempts of -untrained- bullshitting become so stereotypical that it is actually kinda fun to watch.<br /><br />TIPS FOR TRAINING YOURSELF<br /><br />First of all, you must put your shit together and know the basics.<br />Remember your name (if you used a fake one), your address (if you used a fake one), your age, your birthday.<br />Another typical question is &quot;what is your major&quot; or &quot;where is your college&quot;. These are less personal, and legitimate driver license holders will definitely reply to these without any hesitation. College kids will reply immediately, kids in highschool will choke as it catches them by surprise.<br />Now, always remember my favorite question, remember the zodiac sign of your fake persona. Even people who don&#039;t care and don&#039;t believe in horoscopes, knows their own zodiac sign. Fakers never think about preparing themselves to that extent, especially men are vulnerable because they really don&#039;t give a shit about the zodiac.<br /><br />Nobody should hesitate or even think when they are asked about their biographical information. Your response *must* be immediate.<br />If it takes two seconds to respond, you failed the test. If you even try to go around the questions, going off on a tangent, you failed the test MISERABLY.<br /><br />You must train yourself until you can reply as naturally as possible, in the same way that you would reply about you real identity.<br />Also have a friend to ask your ID, give him your real one and make him ditch it saying that that it is fake. React to that naturally.<br />Now try again but this time give him your fake ID and try to react in the same way as before.<br />Get a friend to ask you in random times of the day your name, your birthday, etc... you can even film yourself and see how unnatural you look when you respond.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I do with my friends, I ask them randomly &quot;when is your birthday&quot; in any time of the day and they are like &quot;eer... December...&quot; and that&#039;s it, they failed.<br />There is no &quot;eer or uhms&quot; when someone asks your real birthday or any of the questions above, unless you are mentally challenged.<br /><br />Quality-wise, my products are visually indistinguishable from a real one. You&#039;ll really need lab equipment to tell a real one apart from another.<br />Will it work for clubs and bars?, most probably yes, but that depends more on your psychological preparation and your body language. You must believe and feel to be entitled to be there, and react accordingly.<br /><br />ASKING OPINIONS ABOUT THE FAKE YOU RECEIVED<br /><br />If you want an honest opinion about the IDs from an cop/ex-cop friend, check their bias by first showing them a real authentic driver license first and ask them their opinion on &quot;this fake ID&quot;. I guarantee that most will say that it is good but not perfect.<br />Then you&#039;ll know it is their ego speaking, and they are not being actually objective.

				What if you get caught trying to buy liquor at a liquor shop with a fake ID? Would they keep it and call the police or just send you on your way or what? And also what if I want an ID but its not one of the states that are advertised on SR?

The cashier at the liquor store deals with customers every single day, we can spot a kid who has no experience in drinking and especially no experience in buying, by how they roam around absolutely clueless and asking stupid questions.<br />Really, it is *that* revealing, we don&#039;t even need to ask the ID to know who is underage.<br /><br />Ask me in private which state you need.

				+1 this was an awesome read and I completely agree with you. Dead giveaways are people that don&#039;t know how to act in certain social situations where you have to play the role of being 21+<br /><br />More good tips for fake ID&#039;s.. Use your real birthday! It&#039;s a lot easier to just have to remember the certain year you were born on your ID then to remember an entire 2nd birthday and year. Another good tip for in-state fakes is using a previous address you once lived at. Chances are in your brain you once had it memorized for a long period of time, so it should be already stamped somewhere in the back of your noggin!

				Some liquor stores I go to have a machine that scans the I.D.

When the calculated age is above 21, it displays &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;OK&quot;.<br /><br />This is different from what the police does, they have online access to the DMV through Nlets (or radio, if they don&#039;t have a computer at hand).<br />In that case, you are screwed because when they enter the non-existing fake driver license number, they will, well... find no one in the database.<br />To avoid that, you will have to buy my police-verifiable DL, which will return a result with the matching information from the DMV.

				I would also like to share some tips on using fake ids. <br />First off I would like to say that these are not fool proof, but do help you out, if you look very young or the club is very tight no matter what you do you might never get away with it.<br /><br />1. Buying alcohol at liquor stores:<br />Buying alcohol at LS are so easy, that anyone with an id that says they are over 21 even the opposite sex will get alcohol 9/10.<br />If you have a HQ replica fake and its a private liquor store you will never have problems, so there is no need to worry at all.<br /><br />2. Going to clubs<br />Going to clubs is something completely different.&nbsp; Me and my friends have used our ids at clubs many times, and out of the 50-60 times we have gone, we have only gotten 4 confiscated, but there are reasons why.<br />First the OP was right about body language, you must seem extremely confident, greet the bouncer, and have a smile on your face.&nbsp; Next you must only go up with yourself with a fake id, and by that i mean you don&#039;t want 5 kids going up with fakes, it seems a lot less conspicuous if you go up with another friend not using a fake or with another group of people obviously over the age of 21.&nbsp; Finally you must stay vigilant, you have to know which clubs will fuck you and which ones won&#039;t.&nbsp; I know all the clubs around here that know my fake so i stay away from those, and I know which ones are cool clubs, only go to those.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nevertheless I still had my ID taken at a club once and detained by a police officer even though I had previous drank there before, but my biggest mistake was I went up with a group of people, still, I don&#039;t think this situation could have been avoided, although I was not arrested, I lost one my IDS.<br /><br />Another piece of advice i can give you is if your ID scans use it to your advantage.&nbsp; A lot of clubs will glance at your Id to make sure its your face and throw it in the scanner.&nbsp; If your ID scans your in the clear, other clubs that activily look for the birthdate may find flaws and also will think about it more.&nbsp; <br /><br />One more thing is don&#039;t worry too much about getting arrested using it.&nbsp; Kicking you out of the club is enough most of the time just don&#039;t give them too much lip.With these tips 3 of my friends have actully fooled cops(even when one of them was completely drunk.)&nbsp; But if they look up your ID number your in deep shit.<br /><br />Hope I can help I personally do not use my ID at clubs anymore because now I have SR and there is bigger and better things to do :) .<br />

				I always beat the bouncer by just going on the offensive. Not at first of course, but if they said &quot;this is fake&quot; I&#039;d instantly demand that they call the police and give me my ID back. They never once called the police and they always gave me it back, sometimes they still wouldn&#039;t let me in though.<br /><br />But no-one ever called my bluff. I guess they figured that anyone brazen enough to demand that they call the police immediately can&#039;t possibly be underage
