				Hey guys, I was just wondering if someone could help me out with .1 btc to complete an order. I slightly underestimated how much money I would need. <br /><br />address: <br />19WftRgfNMmdHXwD9eTQLWS9grF7i9714f <br /><br />I&#039;ll repay the favor to someone else next time I deposit.<br /><br />

				These postings are such bullshit. I like when Nomad locks these. This guy doesn&#039;t even give his Silk Road name. Just a BTC address. If he were legit he would give his Silk Road name.<br /><br />I am all for the Christmas Spirit and helping a fellow member out. BUT this is a scam.... as are 99% of them. If he was .1 short he could use his brain and check btc rates and see it is going up and if he waited for an hour or 2 he would have plus money and not be short.<br /><br />DON&#039;T GIVE THIS LIAR A PENNY PEOPLE<br /><br />Also these ass holes could always change there order.<br /><br />Bottom line is there are some people that need a genuine &quot;loan/gift&quot; ...Just like there are some people that have seen a UFO. This fuck stick is neither.<br /><br />Also I have helped over 30 people in the last 8mo....not 1 has EVER paid me back.

				I agree those that give addresses instead of releasing a username is generally 90%+ scam.<br />I caught one trying to do it via PM one day a month or so ago.<br />I&#039;m not stupid I did a quick search on sr before responding and then the guy had registered the username minutes after i searched for it and it didnt exist. Suddenly it was there.&nbsp; ha some people are just completely lacking in morals and brain damaged.

				I had a nice guy loan me .17 a little while back, I made sure to give him .5 when I made my next bitcoin deposit. <br /><br />Shit is low if people need to try to scam for a few dollars.
