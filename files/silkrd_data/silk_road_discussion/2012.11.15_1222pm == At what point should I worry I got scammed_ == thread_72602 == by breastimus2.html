				So I ordered from a vendor like 7-8 days ago...He&#039;s marked package in transit 6 days ago...I chose priority mail domestic in USA...Vendor advertises average length shipping domestic to be 2 days...It&#039;s been a holiday weekend for mail men so really, the package has been in transit for almost 4 days (if mail doesn&#039;t bring it today, it will be 4)

				Just be cool. Sometimes things get delayed, give it a few more days and ask him if he put a DCN on it at least.<br /><br />goblin

				I&#039;ve had something not show up from an order over 2 weeks ago. These things happen. If the vendor you ordered from is a trusted vendor with a 99/100 rating then you shouldn&#039;t worry too much. Most decent vendors understand stuff goes missing and are willing to discuss a compromise or refund.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the US postal system or which state you are in but I&#039;d say 4 days isn&#039;t really a long time, general advice is to wait at least 7-10 days before worrying about it. You have at least another 10 days before auto finalise and you can contact the vendor in the meantime and even choose to resolve if that doesn&#039;t work out.<br /><br />Its not a nice thing to happen but its something all SR users have to deal with at some point.

				Remember that it&#039;s also the start of the holiday season for shipping in the US. They&#039;re expecting a 20% increase in package delivery this year and expecting to deliver 18 billion packages, letters and cards during the season.&nbsp; If your package is a little delayed, this is probably why.<br /><br />(I&#039;m in the same boat as you, but I&#039;m just waiting on an ATM card my bank sent me as a replacement, lol.&nbsp; They told me it&#039;d be here on Tuesday, still haven&#039;t received and it&#039;s pissing me off.)<br /><br />Oh, and my last priority package here on the Road took 3 days... and that was same state, less than 400 miles between sender and me, in October. I expect 4-6 days to be average right now.<br /><br /><br />

				Ok so I&#039;m starting to freak out again. There&#039;s a beware of DMT scammers thread in the Rumors forum and there&#039;s a red flag written about him in it. Before I made the purchase, I searched the forum for the vendor and didn&#039;t find anything to suggest that he&#039;s a scammer, but afterwards, the DMT scammer thread was updated with his name. Geez. Vendor name FatBurger... I will give updates. Hopefully this is just paranoia :( but his ad does seem a little too good to be true though :( :( :(

				The dmt scammer thread always had his name in it, You couldnt see it cause you dont have acess to the vendor roundtable but I posted it in the rumer mill also for all to see.<br />Please dont give this guy any false hope. He needs to just go straight to resolution once hes abel. The guy already lied and im sure he can not produce a DCN # for breastimus2&#039;s order.<br />Keep us informed BREASTIMUS2 :-\

				6 days in transit is no big thing. The thread you are freaking out at was started by a &#039;selfless&#039; DMT vendor, who is trying to scare people from using his competitors. Even in the thread he says he has no evidence and there has been no allegations made, he is merely suggesting that because he can&#039;t score mhrb easily that no one else in the world can, so any vendor selling DMT other than him is probably a scammer. <br /><br />Good luck with your order mate I hope it comes through, just remember you have the resolution centre and your money is in escrow. If it doesn&#039;t come through I would suggest you use Walter. His packaging is considered the best on SR by a lot and I agree, I doubt he would have trouble getting through US customs. Also his product is so good he does not have to rely on lame threads discouraging people from using his competitor&#039;s goods.

				I said to watch out for DOMESTIC sellers, not every body else in the world. Yea is hard to score bark but maybe I left out the part that I stocked up. And it dosent take a genius to to put it all together that breastimus2 is being selectively scammed, I mean the Vendor has already lied in a message. I cant wait to see what happens cause if Im rite than I called it the first day I saw that listing with no pic and sweet price, All to good to be true. I Probably made that post about domestic dmt sellers before breastimus2 made his account :P .

				Yea dude your shipping time isnt anything to fret over yet. Though if youve seen some red flags about the vendor you purchased from in a review thread then i wouldnt be to hopeful for a successful transaction. I just hope you didnt spend too much with out having done the proper research. <br />&nbsp;If that is the case you will have learned from you mistakes, as i did , and lots of other people. Best of luck!

				The real question, that nobody seems to have asked yet, is if you FE&#039;d.<br /><br />If you didn&#039;t FE, then you didn&#039;t get scammed.&nbsp; You got the chance to exercise the escrow service.&nbsp; Sure, it sucks to be a newbie with a &quot;black mark&quot; on your stats, but everyone here understands the system.&nbsp; And we talk a lot amongst each other.<br /><br />Order away, don&#039;t FE, tell us when they fuck you, tell us when they don&#039;t!<br />
