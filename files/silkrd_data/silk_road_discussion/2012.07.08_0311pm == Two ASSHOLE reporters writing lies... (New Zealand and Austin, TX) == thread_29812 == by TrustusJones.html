				Both articles reference child porn on SR in the first paragraph... obvious lies meant to inflame the public. <br /><br />FIRST: http://www.nzherald.co.nz/connect/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501833&amp;objectid=10818083<br /><br />A hidden internet marketplace hawking drugs, guns, child porn - and even uranium - counts New Zealanders among its traders.<br /><br />Silk Road, a website which promises anonymity to traders, is currently under investigation by a New Zealand government agency. More details on the investigation are expected later this month.<br /><br />Heroin, methamphetamine, opium and other drugs are sold openly at the &quot;anonymous marketplace&quot;. Some overseas vendors target Kiwi and Australian buyers.<br /><br />One discussion, &quot;successful New Zealand orders&quot;, features Silk Road clients commenting about drug deals. &quot;It&#039;s all down to the vendor ... I&#039;ve received stuff from the Netherlands, no problems,&quot; a user called Nineinchnails writes.<br /><br />Another Silk Road user, Kiwiana, was interested in how big the potential market for cannabis could be. &quot;Just seeing if there is any demand for a Kiwi vendor selling skunky buds ... If I get enough people I&#039;ll start up a vendor account. Have heaps of bud but no clients so can do cheap prices.&quot;<br /><br />A German-based drug vendor called Sesampino(97) had a batch of MDMA crystals for sale to Antipodeans.<br /><br />&quot;Our product is always of highest quality and comes from the Dutch market. If you&#039;re buying this, then you already know what it is about. We ship a full gram, so not 0.8 or 0.9. You get what you pay for.&quot;<br /><br />Sesampino explained how he exported drugs. &quot;The envelope looks like a very normal invoice or business letter. We have used this system for years and never lost a shipment. &quot;<br /><br />Silk Road was accessed by downloading a browser, The Onion Router, known as TOR. Goods were bought with a virtual currency, Bitcoins. This week, one Bitcoin equalled NZ$8.09. Sesampino was selling 10g of &quot;low-budget cocaine&quot; for $720 this week. In New Zealand, 1g of cocaine had a street value of $350-$400.<br /><br />Silk Road and other &quot;Hidden Wiki&quot; sites offered services including blackmail, fixed sports matches and assassination. Elsewhere, counterfeit Australian bank statements, university degrees and driving licences were discussed.<br /><br />A Silk Road user called &quot;nz&quot; asks: &quot;Could I get a NSW full off ya and transfer into full New Zealand licence?&quot;<br /><br />Silk Road also had products for paedophiles, offering child porn and advice on how to escape detection. This was the reason for a FBI investigation into it last month, and for an attack by hacker group Anonymous, which leaked information about child porn merchants.<br /><br />A manifesto on the site outlined some of the beliefs Silk Road backers held. &quot;We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so far tens of thousands have done so.&quot;<br /><br />A new marketplace, The Armory, offered guns and weapons for sale. One user hoped it would deflect attention from Silk Road&#039;s drug trade. &quot;Segregating the weapons trading from silk road may [displace] some of the heat aimed at this community.[sic]&quot;<br /><br />Officials here are reluctant to comment while investigating, but obvious problems are getting product into the country, and the risk of rip-offs.<br /><br /><br />SECOND: http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/investigations/website-enables-easy-illegal-drug-sales<br /><br />Website enables easy illegal drug sales<br />Digital black market activity hard to trace<br /><br />Updated: Friday, 06 Jul 2012, 7:32 AM CDT<br />Published : Thursday, 05 Jul 2012, 8:32 PM CDT<br /><br />Leslie Rhode<br />AUSTIN (KXAN) - Log on to the Silk Road Anonymous Marketplace, and you may think you are looking at an eBay-type website. However, you will not find children&#039;s clothing or used electronics to buy.<br /><br />Shoppers on Silk Road may buy illegal drugs including marijuana, ecstasy and heroin. Buyers simply search for a drug, look through the options including photos, add it to their online cart and wait for it to arrive in the mail.<br /><br />The sellers are listed as living all over the world, and are even evaluated and rated by past shoppers. You can even read comments about the sellers. It sure sounds like eBay, but Silk Road has federal investigators watching it very closely.<br /><br />A spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington, D.C. told KXAN News they are &quot;very aware of Silk Road&quot; calling it a &quot;big problem&quot; and confirming to KXAN they are&nbsp; investigating the website.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s scary,” said recovering drug addict Cary Acevedo. “It&#039;s very scary.&quot;<br /><br />Acevedo is a recovering drug addict in Austin who sees Silk Road as a huge setback in the drug war and an even bigger setback for addicts like herself.<br /><br />&quot;I was real good at getting my family to give me money and doing whatever it took,” said Acevedo. “There was a lot of lying and stealing, to tell you the truth, to get to my drug. <br /><br />Acevedo talked about leaving her family in the middle of the night and risking her safety just to get her hands on drugs. She would do whatever it took to feed her addiction.<br /><br />“My God -- to have something delivered to me and not have to do anything at all but push a button,” said Acevedo.&nbsp; “Boy, that sounds really good to an addict.&quot;<br /><br />How Silk Road works<br /><br />Silk Road runs on an anonymous network called TOR or The Onion Router. Dr. Qijun Gu at Texas State University has been researching the technology for years. He said he believes the United States government has used it, but was surprised to learn it may be used to sell illegal items.<br /><br />&quot;TOR basically is technology to hide people&#039;s identity in the network when they use the network to send information,” said Gu.<br /><br />TOR works by using encrypted messages. The beginning message from the buyer or seller is encrypted or encoded several times. Then the message is sent randomly through Silk Road members&#039; computers all over the world, and at each stop, part of the message is revealed. Think of it as peeling off the layers of an onion. By the time the entire message reaches its destination, the person who receives it has no idea where it came from.<br /><br />The hidden nature of TOR makes Silk Road a perfect outlet for a drug addict to hide his or her disease, according to drug counselors.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s almost like Amazon,” said Austin Recovery clinician Ilana Zivkovich. “You&#039;ve got one-click shopping. Now drug addicts are experiencing some of the same things which will only intensify their disease and the negative consequences to them, their families and the community.&quot;<br /><br />Zivkovich said the internet is becoming more of a problem in the drug war and treatment of drug addiction, because it is an easy trigger of a drug habit.<br /><br />&quot;My first reaction when I heard of Silk Road was shock and disgust,&quot; said Zivkovich.&nbsp; &quot;I think the fact that this is happening online at the fingertips of our children is a terrible thing.&quot;<br /><br />If your child, husband or friend has any dramatic change in their peer group, in the way they are dressing themselves or in their mood, Zivkovich said those may be warning signs that they are experimenting with drugs or already are addicted.&nbsp; If they start isolating themselves in any way, possibly on their computer, she said you should ask questions.<br /><br />Silk Road adds firearms<br /><br />Just in the past few months, Silk Road added firearms to its black market digital store. Some of them are illegal in the United States. Buyers may find them spun off on a new anonymous website called &quot;The Armory.&quot;&nbsp; It also runs on the TOR anonymous network. Now the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is on alert.<br /><br />The ATF sent KXAN News a statement saying the &quot;ATF is aware of &#039;Silk Road Marketplace,&#039; an encrypted members-only website, as well as other online sites that may be involved in the illegal sale of firearms. ATF is always concerned when it learns about these types of websites. One of ATF&#039;s primary missions is to enforce firearms laws and to protect the public from violent criminals.&quot;<br /><br />Hard to trace&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Getting on either Silk Road or The Armory takes some work. It not as simple as just searching for it through Google. <br /><br />Other than the complicated anonymous network, another reason investigators may have a harder time tracking down those involved in these sites is the currency used for purchases. The websites do not take a check or credit card but only Bitcoins , perfectly legal digital money that Silk Road claims is not traceable.&nbsp; &nbsp;The trading rate for Bitcoins fluctuates constantly.<br /><br />DEA has been investigating Silk Road for more than a year. New York Sen. Charles Schumer publicly pushed the DEA to shut down Silk Road in June 2011.<br /><br />Most local law enforcement entities that KXAN News asked about Silk Road and The Armory had not heard of the websites.<br /><br />The illegal items are sent through the mail. The United States Postal Service, United Parcel Service and FedEx said they cannot discuss their security measures.<br /><br />There are other legal uses for the TOR network: Some journalists use it to keep their sources private; businesses use it to keep information secure and private.

				these articles always end up increasing awareness and explaining how to access the site in broad terms, i wonder if their motive isnt to shut it down but to give it some free publicity.<br /><br />on a serious note, they throw in CP references because they know that no one will call them on it.

				They didn&#039;t mention that in that CP thread, 99% of people were flaming the fuck out of the pedos.. There was only one guy from my memory that was actually an admitted &quot;kid-lover&quot; and a couple sympathisers, who at MOST said that pedophiles needed help and not punishment (an argument that was ripped by almost everyone in that thread)..<br /><br />So where the fuck are they getting this shit about SR selling child porn? <br /><br />Are they equating SR with THE ENTIRE TOR NETWORK? <br /><br />That&#039;s fucking absurd. That&#039;s like saying microsoft encourages child porn because you have to use a computer to download it. Fucking cretins.

				haha, those articles were full of lulz.<br /><br />it scares the people who want to be scared, intrigues the people who want drugs, and pisses off the cops who can&#039;t do shit about us.<br /><br />let them write whatever they want; i&#039;m still getting whatever drug i want and DPR is laughing all the way to his swiss bank.<br /><br />the authorities have been trying to shut down CP on the net for 2 decades with no success....it took Anonymous to actually get some shit done.&nbsp; this is strong evidence that the authorities are a clown show and the real power lies within the cyber community.

				I wish people would stop trying to interfere with us, if some fucking junkie is going to keep ordering until they overdose that&#039;s their own fault. But we should be allowed to freedom to make that choice ourselves. These reporters and government officials are getting in the way of mother nature. It&#039;s called survival of the fittest, people endanger themselves by ordering shit like heroin, it&#039;s not the Silk Road&#039;s fault if they end up dying as a result of their own stupidity.<br /><br />I notice none of these shitty articles give any insight about members like me who use the service for psychedelics to enlighten themselves withing the confines of their own property, and let&#039;s be honest that&#039;s way safer then driving out to the bar and getting shit-faced drunk and possibly endangering the lives of others on the way home. If everyone could legally order their own drug of choice through the mail, I&#039;d make a bet the streets would be a lot safer in most parts of the world. The world needs more reporters like Hunter S. Thompson again, we could sure as hell use them on our side.

				the viewpoint of an addict should have very little space decicated in this article, if any.&nbsp; the fact is, addicts are probably the one group of drug users who wouldn&#039;t be too interested in silk road.&nbsp; i&#039;ve been an addict before, and during that time i was far toobusy getting drugs on the street and doing them to find something like SR.&nbsp; an addict wants his shit RIGHT NOW not at the rate of first class mail.&nbsp; and they definitely don&#039;t want to pay for exchange fees and the like.

I wonder how many people have read an advertisement like this in their local paper and made their way here as I sure have.&nbsp; ::)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 , New here, I first read about the site on Wired.com a couple months ago, and that&#039;s how I found my way here.<br /><br />I admit I have an addictive personality, and that&#039;s exactly why I think SR is a perfect place for me to buy an occasional chill-pill or whatever. It&#039;s much less dangerous impov , given my propensity to go overboard in the past...<br /><br />Having a &#039;local&#039; connection is what makes and breeds &#039;addicts&#039;. When you run out and &#039;need&#039; more, you just call your local dealer and get it in a matter of hours...<br /><br />There are no &#039;addicts&#039; that order some psychedelics here,&nbsp; a gram of coke here, a couple xtc pills here, or a couple of pain killers of their choice here. There are no addicts that buy a small quantity, then wait 1 or 2 weeks for their next order to arrive...<br /><br />Perfect situation for me. And maybe, I can get an epiphany from whatever I happen to order here, to move away from the main monkeys on my back, which are all happily approved as legal by my government overlords...<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty much a functional alcoholic, and can buy all the booze I want every night after work, and I smoke tobacco too. It seems ridiculous that I would be thrown in jail if somehow got nic&#039;d for ordering some psychedelic that may open my mind to the err of my ways in continuing to abuse myself with booze and tobacco...&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
