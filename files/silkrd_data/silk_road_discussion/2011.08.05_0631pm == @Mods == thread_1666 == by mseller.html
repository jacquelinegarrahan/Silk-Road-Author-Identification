				I want to say something. We should consider to post only when we really need to do so. Here are many information what may be harmful to our community. Location, number of transaction, name exchangers etc etc. We dont need to reveal too much. Mods, delete such data, we dont need unwanted intention..

				There has been a lot deleted posts/threads. Most people dont know those because they are taken down rather quickly. There is a function where you can report the post and it will get the attention of a mod. So, if you dont think it should be there, feel free to do so..<br /><br />

				I&#039;m usually on top as much stuff as possible and on most of the day, recently i took a much needed step back from the community for 2 days and am back.<br />Send PM&#039;s about info you think is out of place or hit the report to moderator button in the corner of every post. <br />:D<br />

				Mseller, I agree.&nbsp; We can reveal so much about ourselves through our writing, and most here do it unknowingly.&nbsp; Too much irrelevant information is given up, the totality of which can be like a fingerprint. This fingerprint can be compared to writing on other web-sites, social media, etc.&nbsp; with the intention of connecting a SR pseudonym with a facebook identity, an email address or a real name.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Just because your paranoid, doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not after you&quot;

				Exactly what I meant to say. Its in humane nature to communicate and ask support. But dont forget what this is all about. This is still open to all around and never know who is who.<br />I am afraid that we talk to damn much and that all of this will gone in no time.<br />I ask every member here. Stop with chit-chat. Do your biz with your vendor and that is it! If have something immportant to say, then post it in appropiate place and manner and fowarded to right person.
