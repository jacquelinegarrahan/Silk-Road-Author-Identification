				Are people really surprised? This was inevitable. <br /><br />Unless SR change their stance on gun sales, this will be the final straw for this place. The influx of people last year following the publicity was a good PR coup, and well played. This time, it will be a disaster. Even if it does survive, I don&#039;t want to be around the kind of people that this publicity will attract.<br /><br />

				yea, drugs are one thing (an awesome thing) - but guns...? I mean common. With drugs, it&#039;s all about the escape, the happiness, subconscious exploration, and feeding the black market. With guns, yea it can be about protection - but if you&#039;re buying illegally, chances are it&#039;s not just for fucking protection. If that were the case, why not just buy one from a gun store - or better yet, a gun show? All of this damn gun talk is going to do is bring the wrong type of people here (LE, violent criminals, etc.). And for what cost? So some dudes can get a damn Uzi sent to their door?? By allowing this type of traffic will only fuck over the peaceful members in the end.

				Weapons and Ammunition will just bring more heat for SR. <br /><br />Not only that, but there will be more inter-agency cooperation if there is a drugs+guns connection. <br /><br />Fuck Gawker for the article, but it was inevitable.<br /><br />I appreciate freedoms, as do all of you... But if the #1 rule is not to HARM anyone, then weapons most definetely should NOT be permitted. It defeats the purpose... They are used only for one thing, to HARM.<br /><br />my 2c

				Having a weapon is the best argument during a confrontation for neither party to harm each other at all. It is necessary for humanity to wield force in a manner that contradicts violence itself. Never say an object has one use or purpose— it is a human who chooses his purpose and lives righteously or not.

Im thinking that SR is down because they are going to pull the guns and make some changes, if it were because of traffic, some of us would eventually get in, i havent heard one person making it in...<br /><br />When vendors or buyers speak to the media, all it does is give them more words to put in the article.

				Silk Road&#039;s anonymous administrator wouldn&#039;t comment for the article, asking if I could wait for four months until they were prepared for another influx of attention; he said he&#039;s currently &quot;hardening&quot; the site and adding more &quot;exciting&quot; features. &quot;Last time you wrote an article about Silk Road, we got a lot of attention, new members, and even some heat from the feds,&quot; he wrote. &quot;That was good for us, but we weren&#039;t completely ready for it.&quot;<br /><br /><br />i would love to hear how that exchange went. was this guy buttering SR up and made him think he was on SR&#039;s side? did he say it was otr? SR seems like a very intelligent and confident person. saying something like that seems to me like it was goading some sort of LE to make a move.

				The masters of SR knew the implications of allowing gun sales. This isn&#039;t a surprise to them. Therefore there is no, &quot;we told you so.&quot; It&#039;s not that they allowed gun sales out of greed, but out of principle. They are after all, revolutionaries. I think many forget that and just see SR as a convenient place to buy and sell drugs. But the truth is, you&#039;re part of a movement that&#039;s bigger than a mere Amazon.com of drug sales.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Relax for a bit. I know that&#039;s a hard thing especially if you&#039;re addicted to your DOC (drug(s) of choice). But have a little faith in those who are running this great experiment.&nbsp;

				if sr is going to remove guns because you guys want he may as well remove drugs because people dont like them, this can become another fucking amazon and remove all illegal goods. <br />&nbsp;<br />dont try to pretend drugs are accepted by the world more then guns. i guarantee the drug article gawker wrote got far more attention around the web then the gun article. guns have been on this site longer then most the poeple in this thread.<br /><br />&nbsp;sr clearly has a vision for this site and i certainly agree with it. at first i was against&nbsp; guns but they make up such a small part of this site anyway. honestly we went through all this when sr created the weapons category. most of you are late to the party. <br /><br />i respect that some of you guys hate guns, but you should respect some people love guns. and not killing people with guns but just collecting and shooting them. do people who love to collect guns not have a right to purchase them in your eyes? THIS IS A FREE MARKET! if you dont like the guns here then dont buy them. if no one buys them then the sellers will leave. thats how a free market works, whining to sr about the guns is bullshit. if theres a market for them here then fine and if not thats fine too. <br /><br />instead of making threads attemting to get sr to remove guns you should be making a boycott gun sellers thread. that is the way it should be done. <br /><br />remember sr is &quot;captain of the ship&quot;, you guys pay to ride not pay to rule. the only thing i cared about sr not selling strongly was CP and so long as there is no cp i will back up the decision to allow sales of any kind on here. <br /><br />lets be real here, the gun section is not what made gawker write that article because guns have been on sale here for along time, its you guys suddenly making threads about it again that brought the attention of the media. so really its your guys fault this happened. with in a week of everyone suddenly freaking out about guns AGAIN the article got wrote. you guys brought this on yourself. the guns didnt bring gawker back to sr the whining on the forums did.

				If there were NO GUNS on SR.....then Journalists wouldn&#039;t be able to write an article about buying guns and Drugs on SR.<br />You wouldn&#039;t read the sentence &quot;Now you can buy a Glock with your LSD.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Just that sentence alone gives some pretty scary imagery to alot of people.&nbsp; &nbsp;People already fear LSD due to ignorance.....but when you add GUNS to LSD that can lead to hysteria IMO.&nbsp; &nbsp; Not everything is allowed on SR....No CP and Guns should be added to that list.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are way too many other sources to obtain them.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s not worth the extra attention.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#039;t care too much before....I guess I was apathetic but if the timing of this rather long SR outage&nbsp; has ANYTHING to do with the Guns on SR Gawker article then everybody on SR needs to take notice is all I&#039;m saying.&nbsp; &nbsp;SR is the captain and we are all on this ship of fools together.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes even a Captain can lead the ship into danger......does Italy come to mind anybody?&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to stay on this ship.....not have it SUNK by the extra attention.&nbsp; &nbsp;DEA is already here.....do we really need ATF too?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Variety Jones- you sound suspicious? I ran across this link too a few days ago when I put &#039;Silk Road tor&#039; into google, came up in the top 10 hits. Gawker&#039;s a pretty mainstream site.<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought 100BTC, on the off-chance that this, along with a few associated articles which have run in the past few days, and the BBC R5 program on 5th Feb might precipitate a little bubble as happened last June when the first few mainstream articles ran.

				Maybe I am an optimist but the gun vendors of SR should see this new exposure as a business opportunity. I say more exposure=more sales. Even if some of the customers are LEO, its for the vendor to sell his goods without being traced.
