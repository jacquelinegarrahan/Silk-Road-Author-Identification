				There is a delay with SR Support, but my main issue is the lack of support from SR Support.&nbsp; I made a purchase from a vendor in escrow.&nbsp; The vendor marked the item in transit and then messaged me saying he would ship when I finalized.&nbsp; I responded to cancel my order if it can&#039;t be done in escrow.&nbsp; The vendor has been outed as a scammer and his account has been suspended.&nbsp; I messaged SR Support with these details and asked to have my order cancelled.&nbsp; The response was that the vendor&#039;s account has been suspended and they are currently working with the vendor.&nbsp; I guess since BTC&#039;s are rising, there is no incentive to cancel since it becomes a loan they can make interest on.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame to see such indifference on SR Support&#039;s end.&nbsp; Guess they want to wait until I can cancel so they get the fee plus the interest on my hedged BTC&#039;s.

You must put the order into resolution when the option becomes available to you and request a full refund. Any refund given under circumstances where a vendor has been suspended will not affect your refund rate.<br /><br />As you can see, there is full protection for buyers in cases such as this when they stay in escrow.<br /><br />Libertas

				Cheers as always to the SR staff!! Keep it up!<br /><br />Must say the process for banning/suspending a vendor should be updated to also cancel/refund all the open orders. When a vendor is banned for scamming and customer has an open order marked &#039;in-transit&#039; and they are banned, customer must message SR support requesting the cancel which takes time (days) and puts more strain on support.<br /><br />

It has absolutely nothing to do with indifference or some weak attempt at trying to scrap together a few extra BTC from buyers.<br /><br />

We speak of when a vendor is banned and removed for obvious or concrete scamming, when they are demoted back to a regular user account and there is no question of the scamming. This is mostly the FE scam, but in those FE scams many times high stat buyers are allowed to stay in escrow to keep up the scam a bit longer. Then the vendor is removed and pending in-escrow orders are in limbo.<br /><br />This is likely a rare scenario, but has happened to a few buyers we know, luckily nobody we know FE&#039;s ;)
