If your product is high grade and well priced, people will buy it. But be warned that it&#039;s a free market and if you advertise low quality shit as A++++, you will get called on it :) Treat it (and the customers) with the same care you would with a legit business.<br /><br />Unrelated, but if you were nicked picking up enough to deal, what happened? Did you get charged, etc? Also, if you were nicked picking up from your supplier, has your supply been compromised? Are you definitely still able to procure more product?
