				the no.1 vendor here for my specific DOC only ships within USA. which really really really sucks because obviously i&#039;m outside US. there has to be a way besides asking an american friend to reship for me. what can a poor chap like me do to receive those US only goodies??

				I suggest messaging the vendor and asking him/her to ship to you internationally. The worst that could happen is they say no. They may make you FE, or they might say no, but there is only one way to find out.<br /><br />Or like you said you could have a friend in the us order it and reship it to you. Good luck.

				or you use something like myus.com. Of course they have your address, but if the vendor isn&#039;t very stupid, they wont check it.

				yes, i would also like to know this! would they open the package? i was hoping there was some kind of listing on sr (maybe under Services) that offered this reshipping of US only mail to us international bastids. couldn&#039;t find that.

				I ship my weed domestic, but if someone was (hypothetically) desperate enough to reach out to me asking to ship some to them, I would just ask that they pay for express or priority shipping.<br /><br />Id probably offer a 50% refund on an express shipped item if they didn&#039;t get it. And something like a 25% refund on priority. If they didn&#039;t get it... that would be my thought on the matter.&nbsp; 8)

				Hi,<br /><br />afaik they promise to not open packages, unless they have reasonable doubt that something illegal is being shipped, that&#039;s what they are bound to by law.<br /><br />Anyway, I will soon order an item that is strictly prohibited to import here (at least without informing some LE officers) this way, if anyone is interested and has the time, wait for my report, in 4-6 weeks I guess.

				so lets say i have a friend in usa, that i want to simply reship a package that arrives to him from sr. what i don&#039;t want is for him to open it up or anything. which he won&#039;t.<br /><br />how does he send the package overseas?<br /><br />can he simply take the envelope he receives from sr, and send that same envelope to an international destination?<br /><br />or does he have to get a new envelope and PUT the sr INSIDE that new envelope?<br /><br />what i&#039;m hoping i can do is simply go to usps / ups / fedex and create a label for that package.. email it to him, so he can print it out, and then he would paste that label on the same envelope, right?<br /><br />but to do that all those sites require a weight of the package and a description for customs.<br /><br />without actually seeing the package or being able to weigh it, does that mean HE has to weigh it?<br /><br />what would the appropriate description for customs be? &quot;gifts&quot; or &quot;documents&quot;?<br /><br /><br /><br />then does he have to go to a post office or can he use those blue public mail boxes and just slip the envelope inside one of those?<br /><br /><br /><br />what i&#039;m looking for is for someone to please post a step by step tutorial for someone like myself that needs the mail forwarding to international.<br /><br /><br /><br />btw, this would only be for tiny amounts like 1g or less that fit into flat envelopes.<br /><br />

				VIAddress is another American based reshipping company.<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak to their authenticity, but they do seem to be quite large and integrated with e-bay sellers.

				Company&#039;s like myus.com have rules.<br /><br />&quot;&quot;Question&quot;&quot;<br />Can you mark my item as a gift or reduce the value of it to help me avoid duties and taxes?<br /><br />&quot;&quot;Answer&quot;&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; No. It is against US regulations to inaccurately report the value of an exported item, Members are required to review and confirm all descriptions and values for each parcel prior to shipping.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />But you can try...<br />Tell me how high &quot;&quot;they&quot;&quot; determened the price of your &quot;&quot;gear&quot;&quot;, after receiving.<br /><br />Btw if you take the addon Similar sites in Firefox you will see many services as the myus.com company provides.<br /><br />Wasta<br /><br />

				It would actually be a good operation for someone to set up. A bit messy as at what point would you finalise? But if you had a really professional, trusted vendor, they could act as a middle man! Just a thought...

				I am considering setting myself up as a broker for this very purpose. I am curios if over seas buyers would be interested and what would y&#039;all be willing to pay fee wise. I would need the coin for the purchase and shipping upfront but could keep my fee in escrow. I would keep the buyer constantly updated as to the status of the order as well as provide a variety of shipping options. Would y&#039;all be interested in something like this and what in your opinion is a service like this worth?
