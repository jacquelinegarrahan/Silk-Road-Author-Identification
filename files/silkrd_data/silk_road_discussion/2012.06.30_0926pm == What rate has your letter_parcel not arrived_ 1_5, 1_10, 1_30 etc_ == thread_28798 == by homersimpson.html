				Silk Road: 1 missing out of 5 orders&nbsp; :&#039;( But i don&#039;t FE so hopefully I wont lose out, sucks for the vendor tho&nbsp; :-\<br />For normal mail, which I use a lot its been 0 missing out of thousands of letters sent/received. I send/receive (legal/grey) letters/packages from all over the world too, China, USA, EU ETC. Even from&nbsp; those shady online pharmacies never had a letter go missing. Guess I had to lose one at some time tho, shame it was so early on here.

				I&#039;ve come to the conclusion it&#039;s best to stick with who(what) you know.&nbsp; I plan to use the vendor who successfully got me multiple packages (even though its more expensive) from here on out because at least I get what I pay for.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve had 10 transactions.<br /><br />First one was a scam,i FE cus it was my first transaction. it was the vendor Obamagirl<br /><br />then I placed an order with Skyy and 3jane. (it was actually 2 orders with Skyy)<br />Neither of them came in. They agreed to a reship, Skyy&#039;s reships made it, 3jane&#039;s didn&#039;t<br /><br />She gave me a refund though that we both agreed upon. <br /><br />Since then I&#039;ve been ordering from Pfand with great success, as well as from Eazyjet and Lonely kamel. <br /><br />When PF was having those issues i placed an order with Drnyx and Supertrips so we&#039;ll see how those go!! Hopefully they come in, cus i don&#039;t have much extra cash these days.<br /><br />All my big orders have come in, so I&#039;d consider my rate successful

				2/12<br />I think the first one was a scam. I finalized early because it was my first transaction.<br />The second was from a high-risk country.<br />I didn&#039;t get customs letters for either of the two orders that didn&#039;t arrive, so who knows what really happened.<br />Now I only order from what I consider &quot;safe&quot; countries and I&#039;ve had no problems :)

				1 out of 22, but the vendor refunded me more than the actual cost so overall a good thing. Choose your vendors wisely.

				Well from a different perspective, as a vendor we have sent out 100&#039;s of orders with only 3 disappearing.&nbsp; So some of you guys either have had a run of terrible vendors or luck!<br />NCK

				I&#039;ve received 36/36 on silk road&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve also been using another service since &#039;04 and only had one order of hash go missing out of probably 200.<br /><br />Guess I&#039;ve gotten lucky to not have to deal with orders going missing and I do order international a good bit.

				Thinking I&#039;ve ordered 19 packages. Really hard to tell because of electronic products and btc deals. I haven&#039;t had a problem receiving any package. I&#039;ve mostly ordered from the best vendors.
