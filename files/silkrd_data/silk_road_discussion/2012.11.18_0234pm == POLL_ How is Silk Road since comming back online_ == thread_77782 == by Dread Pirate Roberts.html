				Rarely it&#039;s almost too fast to be a TOR site (like the smooth as silk option says) but then other times it&#039;s no different to what it was before with bad connects and timeouts. It could be TOR though who knows, but for the most part it&#039;s faster than the forums.<br /><br />I would imagine you&#039;re getting more n00bs too which would contribute to it&#039;s slowness.<br /><br />I would suggest a re-evaluation after a couple of weeks wouldn&#039;t be prudent, as it&#039;s too close to re-opening at the moment and if you&#039;ve ever seen the opening of an Apple Megastore, well you can figure it out!<br /><br />- JWM<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=77782.msg604352#msg604352">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on November 18, 2012, 02:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve heard mixed reports about site availability since we came back from the down-time.&nbsp; Please everyone weigh in on how we are doing so I can get a better sense of it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				From my experience in these 2 days : accessible-fast(for tor)<br />About the same speed and ease of access as before the problems started, I only had a 2-3 unexpected log-outs while browsing SR (like deleted cookies or something). That&#039;s the only problem so far for me.<br />Once you get a stable connection with the site it&#039;s pretty fast !

				What Jezuz said, pretty much. <br />Blisteringly fast around 8am-10am UTC, as if on clearnet. <br />And at other times about the same as it was a couple months ago (or a bit faster), which is in itself an improvement given the increase in number of users.<br />Haven&#039;t had any more of those inexplicable logouts in the last 24-36 hours, so I guess you&#039;ve fixed that. Overall it seems stable and useable, so far.<br />

				Its been hit or miss for me today, sometimes I can get in but sometimes it takes a very long time with lots of new identity&#039;s.<br />Not sure if that would be TOR or the sr servers but when I do get in it&#039;s pretty much the same speed it&#039;s been in the past.

				It takes a while to get the login page to come up but once logged in the site runs well.&nbsp; The only issue I&#039;ve experienced is being asked to log out and back in before I was able to successfully place an order.&nbsp; Other than that, it&#039;s been great.

				I wanted to respond with both &quot;Accessible&quot; and &quot;Inaccessible&quot;.&nbsp; It seems about 60/40 for me, as I see others have stated.&nbsp; Better than half the time, I can get in, and once I do, things seem OK.&nbsp; In fact, maybe in those cases I even should say &quot;Fast&quot;, as I don&#039;t know what to expect from Tor given that this is all I&#039;ve ever done with it and I&#039;m new to SR.&nbsp; But often, I can&#039;t get in at all.&nbsp; Repeated retries to get to the login page get me nowhere.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that big a deal because I just give up and try again a little later, usually then getting on, but it does point out some definite need for improvement.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s Tor or me in general because there are a few other very simple things I do with Tor, like checking on existing BC balances elsewhere and checking on shipments with USPS.com.&nbsp; That sort of stuff comes up a bit slowly, but always does come up.<br /><br />Tits<br />

				&nbsp;I&#039;ve been trying for about ten hours or better to complete an order. The item is in my cart and i pick my postage, write down my address and enter my pin..... Then the damn thing sends me to my account page with the bitcoin addresses and asks me to try logging out and back in.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried it and it doesn&#039;t help AT ALL.<br />I have no idea why it&#039;s doing this crap but it&#039;s really annoying. It&#039;s not because there&#039;s not enough funds to make the purchase either, I checked that the first time.

				12pm-6pm(Eastern Standard Time) i usually cant access the site at all <br /><br />7pm-11pm i can access it and its either a little slow or standard<br /><br />12am-2am its is either standard or sometimes silky smooth :)<br /><br />so im guessing when America is awake it is jamming the sever, not to mention Europe is still awake at the same time during those hours cause there&#039;s only like a 5-6hour time difference&nbsp; so after 6pm Europe is sleeping so it clears up and at midnight Europe and lots of America is sleeping so its super clear

				slower than before the most time for me, many time cannot get on still. also having problems w/forum not loading more frequent now, wonder as well about TOR problems all over, have had number of times when SR &amp; forums seem to be gone and cannot access any other hudden service else. nothing simple has been help at these times, of cousre tryd new identity, logging out &amp; back in TOR. i can not see where DPR words of &#039;site improved &amp; sign up more members from improvements all should be good&#039; match with realty many of us experiencing. will not speculate on possible reasons for this here. also hope to receive msg from you DPR about question i send in last day, DPR response to question will ease my worry. lack of reply leads to increase worry &amp; speculation among those with brain yet, nothing short of cold cuffs on wrist will bring worry or thought to cheerleaders who care not to think &amp; question.

				Poll options didn&#039;t completely fit, mostly the fast option but depending on time of day, smooth as silk option. Sometimes connecting takes lots of tries but after you do get in it&#039;s fast, and today I&#039;ve only gotten on three times. Although I just saw someone saying using an onion.to link works, which is definitely true, so I assume it&#039;s some sort of hiccup.

				I think there was a big improvement since the downtime. I find that the initial connection works on the first attempt most of the time (instead of the usual 2-3 attempts), and that subsequently page loads times are reliable and reasonably fast. It&#039;s probably the fastest tor site I&#039;ve used - still slower than a clearnet site through tor, but not by much.

				Seems to me to be largely dependent on my Tor route.&nbsp; I have had to try sometimes 4-5 identities or more, but once I&#039;m on the right identity, SR seems to be much faster than it was for the past year.&nbsp; Whatever measures the IT admins took, they seem to have been effective, as much as such measures can be when dealing with the Tor network.

				Hey DPR,<br /><br />Big respect for the work you are doing.<br /><br />Regarding the site, it is working (though not in this moment - login page just looping for the last hour at least), but generally trying to get in is a pain.<br /><br />I hardly ever get in on a first login attempt after getting the login page (which itself often take multiple refresh attempts). Normally takes 3-5 tries just to get the login screen and then another 3-5 tries, often more, to actually get logged in - which of course is a big drag.<br /><br />Once in it&#039;s OK.<br /><br />I obviously don&#039;t know what your server set up is, but my take is that you need to upgrade it further, and upgrade it seriously so it can handle much greater load.<br /><br />Silk Road is growing and is going to do so exponentially for a long time, and as a vendor I totally want this (we&#039;ll also be moving all our non-SR clients onto SR in time - so this kind of thing will also increase traffic), but don&#039;t want to do this until I know they can have a really smooth experience. Many will just give and go away after a few failed login attempts.<br /><br />So clear feedback from me is that you need to upscale your rig altogether and keep investing heavily in that so that SR can stay robust (in all the ways it needs to be) while handling the present growth and the even greater growth that is coming.<br /><br />Thanks for your dedication and commitment - it&#039;s a good and noble thing that you are doing!<br /><br />BG<br />
