				Say i sold something 10+ days ago for 1 BTC when the BTC price was at $14. The funds have not been released yet.<br /><br />Say the person released the funds today. Would I get the old BTC value of $14 or the new price today at $21 BTC?

				You&#039;ll get the price paid at the time.&nbsp; Basically, it depends on whether it&#039;s hedged or unhedged.&nbsp; If it&#039;s unhedged, you get the bitcoins that are in escrow.&nbsp; Whatever they&#039;re worth, millions, dirt, doesn&#039;t matter -- that&#039;s what you get.<br /><br />If it&#039;s hedged, you get an amount of bitcoins that corresponds to today&#039;s price (what&#039;s in escrow is the USD, unlike the other situation, which is holding BTC in escrow -- so either way, you get bitcoins... but hedged means you get today&#039;s price minus fee).<br /><br />Edit: wait... I may be wrong about that.&nbsp; Consider the 2nd part iffy until someone else confirms or denies it.

				Wow this hurts muh head to think about it.. . ow<br />but you still get drugs in the end, right?&nbsp; &nbsp;haha<br /><br />I think you are right.&nbsp; It has to be hedged or not.&nbsp; Most do hedge prices and its reflected in the end.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=115833.msg781975#msg781975">Quote from: NicMod on January 31, 2013, 07:59 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How do you find out if it is hedged?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When you select any item on a vendor page or from the main menu, it appears in your shopping cart, there is a column showing which orders are hedged and which unhedged. At this point you still have the option to delete the item from the cart, if you don&#039;t like that it is unhedged. <br /><br />Without getting too technical, hedging is just insurance that you don&#039;t lose your shirt (or profit insanely) from a sudden massive shift in the value of BTC it effectively freezes the exchange rate for you and the vendor at the time of the deal being made.<br /><br />The higher BTC go the more drugs ultimately your fixed amount of BTC will buy, they can&#039;t raise prices just because the value of BTC go up, in fact your prices should come down a bit (in BTC) you can (and we prefer to) see the SR wallet expressed in USD, this keeps you focused on what you&#039;re REALLY spending to get those goodies.&nbsp; <br /><br />There once was an incident where Mt. Gox (IIRC) was compromised, and BTC tumbled to about 2c THAT was the time to buy as many as you could afford. :D<br />
