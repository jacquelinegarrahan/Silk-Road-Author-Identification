				Well thanks cleared up now. Thanks guys.&nbsp; <br /><br />I doubt it&#039;s ever a real problem.&nbsp; Nobody can get too far without having decent product anyhow. <br />I notice you loose all the feedback when the item is sold out or is removed.&nbsp; &nbsp; So it&#039;s like scratch with new listings.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I guess this is why he does use such old pictures huh?&nbsp; Don&#039;t want to loose the feedback for the listings . . .

From a security point of view it is a bad idea indeed. Some may argue that it could cause harm to people, but so can a drug overdose; both have legitimate uses rather than their intent being to cause harm, so neither are restricted.<br /><br />Whilst I fully agree with you from a security and anti-scam perspective, I fully agree with DPR from a libertarian perspective; the latter must always take precedent over the former: &quot;Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.&quot;<br /><br />Libertas

				What oldcactushand said...<br /><br />Kind of scary that a vendor account could possibly be sold in a stealth listing and customers may now be purchasing off a complete stranger rather than the original trusted vendor customer had built a good business relationship with..<br /><br />Think there should be some kind of warning or information saying the vendor name has been sold and is under new management.

				I wrote out something very long and deleted it because I thought more about the arguments being made according to Libertarian principles and it makes sense. As a non-libertarian I don&#039;t much like it, but then I guess I can go and start my own online black market if I wanted to.<br /><br />I do have a question though. If someone bought Tony76 or LucyDrop accounts for half the money that was eventually scammed, would there ever be any way to know it, to make it public knowledge? If so, would doing so be permitted (or actively done by SR staff or mods) or would it infringe on these same principles? Would the forum discussions look exactly like they do now, even if one of the moderators knew that the account had changed hands? I have no reason to believe that this was the case for either of these vendors, or any of the rogues, but it&#039;s an important issue nonetheless.<br /><br />Obviously vendor accounts can change hands IRL and no one can be any the wiser, but would it not be in the market&#039;s best interest and in the interest of consumer sovereignty to draw buyers&#039; attention towards the constant possibility that this could have happened, be happening, or has happened? I know it seems quite obvious when you&#039;re on an anonymous online black market, but really, this type of explanation is so rarely mentioned in scamming threads. This is interesting, because basically every conspiracy one can imagine is brought up time and time and again in these threads, but not this one. I don&#039;t think too many people know this can happen. I think wide-spread knowledge of the possibility could help people prevent themselves and others from getting scammed.

				@Libertas Yeah I do see where your coming from on that side of things and agree to a point.<br /><br />And I also think scamming is not so much of a worry as this is where Escrow comes in..<br /><br />My main concern is established accounts could be purchased quietly and used to farm the address of future buyers. We as customers only have the vendors past transactions and feedback to go from when deciding to buy from them or not. <br /><br />Scary to think that I could go and order from who I think is my regular trusted vendor but in reality the account has been sold to LE or some other unknown and I just gave them my bitcoins and my drop address.<br />

				What do you mean when you say farm the address of future buyers?<br /><br />I think the answer to any concern will be along the lines of &quot;this is an anonymous online market place and you never know or have known who you have been buying from, or if it was the same person all the time or it changed hands 7 times in a month.&quot;<br /><br />I just find it interesting that SR actually facilitates these sales and this is never raised amongst the tide of conspiracy theories in threads where vendors have gone rogue, especially the well-established ones. It&#039;s certainly a lot more likely than some of the other ideas that get brought up in such threads.<br /><br />This situation would also concern me much more if I was buying very large amounts regularly from a vendor. A honeypot scenario seems like it would be significantly more appealing to LE than I had previously thought. Am I missing something here?

It&#039;s certainly a lot more likely than some of the other ideas that get brought up in such threads.<br /><br />This situation would also concern me much more if I was buying very large amounts regularly from a vendor.

They are looking for vendors. All tactics they use are to find us not the buyer. Although our opinion is that vendors should have an option to sell the buyer account back to SR if that is the will of a vendor. But the original names should NEVER change hands via a SR sale open or secret.

				I understand why LE wouldn&#039;t honeypot in normal circumstances, but the vendors that sell a lot of bulk... enough that their customers could be targets for LE, since they are no doubt selling IRL... would LE not perhaps attempt to buy one of their accounts? I have no idea how many such vendor accounts would be viable options nor how much bulk gets sold on here, just thinking out loud really.<br /><br />I only buy personal amounts, so this is just interesting to me. If people who actually deal in these amounts tell me to stfu and gtfo then I won&#039;t hesitate to do so. And I&#039;m not even saying that honeypot is a likely scenario, just that it seems more likely to me now than it did before opening this thread.

Whats great about them(and everyone who is reading this should read his post) is you cover both sides of the questions you ask. You also seem very intelligent and you can say though from your point of view you do not agree...but you do agree from the point of view of the people who run this and if you do not like it you can start your own site( and CLEARLY you were saying that so that people understand ---you get it)<br /><br />Also you said if people tell you to stf you will...please don&#039;t in fact write more post! If you can&#039;t tell I am a fan of yours by now..you do now:)<br /><br />So to comment on what you said...though you already said this..the truth is you never know who you are dealing with...and I know you were making the point of say a tony76 had an account on here now that was perfect feedback that he bought off so and so then of course not only would you not buy from him obviously but one would think he was going to pull a scam again or is a lot more likely to then some random new vendor that could have bought the same account...<br /><br />So in your worst case scenario...Y with a year + on here with perfect or near perfect feedback...sells their account to X...and X happens to be tony76...well then X would have an account that Y built up and everyone that continued to buy from Y would not know that X in fact in there vendor now...sure someone could pay attention to where the packages came from, what they are now selling and how they now communicate to know that X is in fact not Y...but by then it could be too late..Where as if tony76 (X) had to buy a brand new account..it would take him some time to build up the account.. So you would think that SR would not want that and therefore would allow the sale of said account...but you would lose all stats from the account that were with it...or make it so it had to be announced that the account now belongs to someone else..<br /><br />If SR&nbsp; did that (allowed one to sell their account but announced that the account was sold and a new vendor owns it and SR takes away feedback and status)...it would still keep with there libertarian ways in allowing one to sell there account...BUT it would protect SR buyers at the same time.. that is something that should be done. As I believe that SR should do everything in there power to protect the buyers first and foremost and to try and stop any potential scamming before it happens.<br /><br />One thing that needs to stop is this whole Honeypot idea..it really is ridiculous (not saying YOU are saying it...its just you brought it up). No ..I repeat..NO LE agency is going to start up an online black market shop/vending account to sell drugs and bust buyers!!! If the people that were not high and/or were not total paranoid people actually spent 2 min thinking about it...it would make no sense. And legally talk about entrap meant???? Holly shit! Not to mention that if you have drugs delivered to your house does not mean you actually had them delivered....someone could have done it to you...I mean think about it...if you REALLY hated someone ..you could buy drugs...have them sent over nite...call the police and tell them so and so is a big time drug dealer and in fact has drugs coming tomorrow and bam...he would be toast...except for he would not eventually... Again I am just trying to make a point...that honeypots are a really stupid paranoid thought that just will not happen...and trust me...it is nothing new...this has been talked about and people have been accusing so and so in being one for over 2 years..of course so and so never was and it never happened...<br /><br />EVER<br /><br />So I too like the idea you can sell your account..I hate the idea the stats of the account don&#039;t disappear and that it is up to the buyer and seller to announce the sale.. But I do know that that DPR&#039;s number one care is people not getting scammed and he is a really smart guy...so I am sure he is on top of this. And if anyone is new and doe snot understand..DPR rarely will tell us all what is really going on. That does not mean he does not care or is not doing anything..in fact is is usually the opposite. Time will tell. <br /><br />If all of a sudden your vendor starts selling from Canada and is selling dope and coke...and makes you FE...don&#039;t its Tony ;)
