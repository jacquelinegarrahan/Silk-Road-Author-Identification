				Last time I tried mephedrone(only the second time), I drove at maximum speed towards the bordello and had the-fucking-best-time ever (but failed to finish, secondary to the experience at that point anyway). Also, it was not expensive, rather cheap infact, but I remember the girl as the most beautiful creature ever.<br /><br />Never had the urge to actually drive there, and go through with it, on any other drug.

Love your style LoL, if I good give reputation points yet I&#039;d +1 you. Season 1 of The Wire was the best in my opinion. Love The Wire though, that reminds me I should re-watch all the seasons. The only disappointing thing is every episode is in a 4x3 aspect ratio which kinda sucks on modern tv&#039;s, I couldn&#039;t find any of it in 16x9 widescreen, unless of course it was just cropped or stretched. Still a really great show.<br /><br />Since we&#039;re adding older shows, <br /><br />-The Wire<br />-Lost<br />-The Sopranos<br /><br />God I love Opiates+TV and maybe some Benzos&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now if its Ketamine I love throwing on some headphones and zoning out in a K-Hole to some good music after IV&#039;ing some Ketamine. I still prefer Opiates/Benzos+TV but Ketamine-IV&#039;d+Music is good to once in awhile. :P

(JWM secretly wanted parental divorce anyway and extra-Dextroampeth too for that matter and so to this day he still hasn&#039;t figured out why they gave children speed to calm them down)<br /><br />15yr old JWM used to smoke weed and take ritalin while masturbating to step fathers secretly located old pirated porn tapes on weekend when his parents were at some party drinking their brains out, if he was at Dad&#039;s house he could just smoke weed in the pool shed and play Megadrive until he fell asleep because Dad was home but too drunk and stuck to his TAB form to notice I was high.<br /><br />17-21yr old JWM used to smoke weed and play N64 (Golden Eye and Starfox) unless he went out on some old school humdinga pingas and tried to pick up, but didn&#039;t have Viagra in those days and as thus would never be able to fuck while high as fuck because JWM couldn&#039;t get a hard on.<br /><br />22-28yr old JWM would use high amounts of cannabis daily, MDMA in stupidly high amounts and LSD every other weekend in vast quantities and think he was having some great insight into the inner workings of the COSMOS, <br /><br />28-32yr old JWM discovered DMT, and thus having grown too old for it to be excusable to attend raves anymore, started partaking in pharmahuasca rituals with a group of friends and actually did get great insight into the illusory nature of reality.<br /><br />32-41yr old JWM gets stoned of an evening with his glass of wine and reminisces about the lost youth and the glory days of the E, culture that has been replaced from what I can tell with an ice epidemic and a generation of zombies will result in the end. I must confess, when I saw 28 Days the movie, I just thought that they were filming a documentary about some people and my local COPS battling the ghetto zombies that lurk in the drug dens a few blocks over the other side of the river, but soon realised it was a re-dramatization of the first time the town completely went dry of meth and the zombies tried to break into the police evidence room to find their &quot;BRAINS&quot;. lol<br /><br />41+yrs JWM Reads books on anything I can find that&#039;s interesting (yep, once you get over 40 that is genuinely an exciting proposition because you&#039;re too old to ethically scout for early twenties pussy and your wife complains at everything you do outside the man cave), and comes on the Silk Road forums at night to snoop around and see what the latest gossip is about what drugs are coming out and who is having their lives ruined by the unjust war on SOME drugs.<br /><br />45+yrs old future divorced JWM will be snorting what&#039;s left of his money off a European porn stars pussy after his wife took half his shit and his kids have completed their degrees and no longer see their father as some sort of role model and he can do many of the things he hasn&#039;t done since his early twenties, some would call it a mid-life crisis.<br /><br />A word to the wise, unless you want to raise disobedient little cuntoxen criminal kids, prepare to sacrifice everything you like to abuse your body with except the odd joint or psychedelic experience when you have kids. Except for when they go to camp or some shit your entheogenic life is over, because otherwise society will tell them their parents are losers who aren&#039;t to be listened to or worse and if they suspect their parents of practices they are taught to despise it will effect their psychological development and self esteem and possibly have extremely negative consequences. An example would be because they aren&#039;t taught the difference between use and abuse or any proper drug education, and if society has already told them their parents are losers with a problem and therefore not to be listened to and this causes them to have low self esteem inciting abuse of God knows what that will be beyond your control, they will end up with a drug habit and no career and they will justify their behaviour (drug usage) because their parents are hypocrites otherwise telling them don&#039;t do it. Then once they&#039;ve been through a religious based 12 Step government forced rehab program after getting into legal trouble, they will blame their whole problem on the parent, because that&#039;s what society will tell them is the cause of their problems and when they&#039;re clean and you actually want to be around them again they will tell you to fuck off their stpudity was your fault. <br /><br />I have seen it happen to a friend of mine who&#039;s kids went rogue because they knew their parents did drugs and started stealing them off them, before they were old enough to understand what drugs were and were secretly addicted before their parents could give them the proper drug education the State failed to do.<br /><br />My $0.02, but it happened to a friend of mine, because through propaganda and poor education the State turned his children into ice addicts, because they knew he smoked pot and thought it was no different because that&#039;s what the government tells them in school!<br /><br />- JWM<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Great post, if I could give reputation points yet I&#039;d give you a +1, nice post brotha.&nbsp; 8)
