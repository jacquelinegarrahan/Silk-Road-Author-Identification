				&nbsp;I Just received this, what does it mean.<br />Why is my address archived<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have recently used an archived Bitcoin address (************************) to deposit *.**** BTC to your account. This address could be retired at any time. It is strongly advised that you use a new bitcoin address for future deposits.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road staff<br /><br />NOTE: This is an automated message.

				No scam. you use press get new address in account page to change BTC deposit address then use old address to make deposit.<br /><br />PM tell you not use old BTC address because you might loose any coin that go there.<br /><br />For safety this bring up question that SR not hold old address at all or very short time. compromise could like past deposits.

That wouldnt be right, you need to use the new address that silkroad gives you to deposit to. It has been suggested that you change that address everytime you deposit money into your SR account anyway. I actually got the same message last night myself and changed it up and now all is good. I was worried i could lose money i already had but that is not the case everything will stay the same except for the addy you deposit to.

				Hey All,<br /><br />It has come up for us when depositing from an exchange site. The address is just an archived one that can be deleted at any time (on the exchange side)<br /><br />Just a security feature. There must be a database for all archived BTC addresses that SR checks against. Please correct me someone if we are incorrect.
