				Hey guys whatsup, Just curious if anybody else is experiancing horrible connection times to BMR, It takes forever &amp; most of the time I get a timeout error.<br /><br />Is the site always this slow or is it just struggling with all the new influx of buyers/sellers ?<br /><br />

				Yea it&#039;s pretty fast for me sometimes, but other times it&#039;s too slow, and times out or takes fucking 5 minutes to load a page.

				Seems better since they upgraded or whatever they did but took me a few goes to get in and all was good until I left for a while and came back and it had bombed out.<br /><br />Probably better at different time zone times when the States are in bed!

				hey Pete I was wandering why they even went after you. From what I could see you were the goto for hide away items a lot more than illegals correct me if I&#039;m wrong but how can they make you bail out if they never charged you with anything? <br /><br />I been tore up from the ground up.&nbsp; Seriously I been crying over this shit<br /><br />you all be safe. Talk at ya later and I hope you get out of it PP<br /><br />Ralph123 out

				BMR speed as been very variable from there - sometimes it times out, sometimes it works like a charm. <br /><br />This could be caused by an overload of customers from SR tuning in surely. <br /><br />I suspect their server is having a hard time dealing with the load - the login page loads fast enough, but anything that is database intensive search as searches is terribly slow from here. <br /><br />Also, i think there is a fair amount of risk that BMR has been compromised by LE as well, so beware!

				At this moment BMR seems to be working at good speed from here, not sure about them allowing new users to register though.
