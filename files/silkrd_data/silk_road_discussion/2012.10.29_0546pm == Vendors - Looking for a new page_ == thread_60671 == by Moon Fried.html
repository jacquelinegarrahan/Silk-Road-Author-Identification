				Hey guys, I&#039;m a bit bored and thought this would be a pretty cool thing to keep me busy while helping the vendors who need it.<br /><br />I notice a lot of vendors don&#039;t really put a lot of work into their vendor profiles. Maybe you&#039;re not fluent in English... maybe you just don&#039;t have the time.<br /><br />I&#039;m an author on a certain website that pays per word depending on your rating. I&#039;m not talking about $5 for a 500 word article, that shit is not worth my time. I have an excellent rating on this particular website and get a pretty good side income from it. I&#039;d like to improve my rating there too, so anything I write that needs to be professionaly done will help me in the long run.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE that the quality of the articles I write for my clients are much higher than the quality of the posts I make on forums. Those are two very different things, I&#039;d like to make that very clear.<br /><br />This service is of course for free.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really expect many vendors to want this, but like I said, I&#039;m bored and want to keep myself busy while helping myself and the vendors.<br /><br />If no one is interested... well, don&#039;t be surprised if you&#039;re a vendor already and I send you an &quot;improved&quot; version of your profile description, lol. :P<br /><br />P.S. Send me a PM if you want to see a few of my sample articles.

				MF (sorry, nothing meant by that, lol), I kinda like that idea, and I, like you, prefer to see a well-written vendor page; I agree it gives a certain amount of confidence that you&#039;re dealing with someone who&#039;s got their shit together, and isn&#039;t out to scam you -- but isn&#039;t that the risk in doing what you&#039;re proposing, that you might inadvertently bring in more victims to a vendor whose ultimate goal is to scam, or for whatever reason ends up taking people&#039;s money and skipping out?<br /><br />I know there&#039;s no way to know who&#039;s going to eventually go rogue/scam -- I think some just get overwhelmed, or get hooked on their own supply, or have things happen IRL that lead them to do something they initially had no intention whatsoever to do.&nbsp; And others just start out from the get-go with that last payday in mind, it seems there&#039;s more of both happening lately, end result either way is lots of people losing money.<br /><br />If you provide these very well-written profile pages for vendors, you take away the ability of customers to glean what they can by seeing what the actual vendor would write.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen lots of posts about how someone came to the conclusion not to buy from someone based on a gut feel, and the only way to get that &quot;feel&quot; is to see what the anonymous person on the other computer wrote;&nbsp; that, along with actual purchase experience, feedback and forum posts as well all play into it, but you&#039;d be taking away one of the buyers&#039; possible protections.<br /><br />Just my .0002 BTC, and I&#039;m certainly open to hearing other opinions.&nbsp; I agree with you that it would help a lot of vendors, and it&#039;s definitely a service some of them need, just hope you wouldn&#039;t end up helping the wrong ones.<br />
