				Still working fine for me... How&#039;s your connection? Maybe restart TOR (however you run it). The servers are probably flooded with people trying to do the same thing at the same time.

				It pisses me off when people call DPR a scammer - if the SR staff were going to scam us they would have done it by now.<br /><br />Plus, think how fucking tiring it is running SR, they are basically working 24 fucking 7 - cut them some slack and let them do what they do best, protect us. <br /><br />Look at the amount of money DPR is making through us, poor cunt probably doesn&#039;t even have any time to spend it. <br /><br />Look what DPR has made possible, I mean really, really fucking think about it - you can get your hands on almost any, yes, ANY illegal substance you want.<br /><br />That is fucking great and that is why I fucking love DPR.

				Not down for me. <br /><br />However, I will just be patient and wait for it to be up. I have a few orders I&#039;ve been trying to place, but the world will not fall apart.
