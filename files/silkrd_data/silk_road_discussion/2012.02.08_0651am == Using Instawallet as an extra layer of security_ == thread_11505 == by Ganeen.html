				After you purchase your bitcoins from an exchange, is it a good idea to deposit them into instawallet first before they go to Silk Road?&nbsp; I have heard conflicting reports if this actually does anything, and since SR tumbles your coins anyway I want to know if it something that should still be done?&nbsp; &nbsp;If it adds any level of security obviously you should do it, but this seems slightly redundant.

Someone who really, really, really wants to track you down can do so by spending enough time looking for you in the BTC transaction logs. Sending your coins through instawallet before hitting SR may make it harder to trace, but not impossible.

				It depends on how linkable your BTC-exchange account is to your real identity. If it&#039;s not, it doesn&#039;t really matter (even following the trace from SR to your BTC-exchange account won&#039;t get them anywhere further). If it is somehow (because you deposit by transfering money from your bank account, for instance), I&#039;d recommend going the extra mile to disconnect your BTC-exchange account from SR. In this case I wouldn&#039;t trust SR that the tumbling done by them is enough.<br /><br />Using an extra wallet like instawallet, only accessed though Tor, probably does the trick. I assume that it&#039;s plausible enough that you transferred the coins to some guy and that that guy used them to buy stuff on SR. I&#039;m not sure if you could keep that story up in the long run.

The online wallet is only linkable to you because you&#039;ve done a transaction to it. There&#039;s no way to prove that that wallet belongs to you, so there&#039;s no way to prove that transactions from that wallet to SR are done by you.<br /><br />On the other hand, it&#039;s only a slightly bigger gap between the real you and SR... Depending on many factors you want to make that gap bigger.

				If you live in the United States, you&#039;re probably fine if you&#039;re just buying from SR. You should never send straight from an exchange to SR or vice versa though; you risk having your account flagged in the future and the coins seized.<br /><br />It is the vendors who need to worry about the BTC trail, because they are the ones who the DEA will target. If you&#039;re just buying some weed or ecstasy in small amounts for personal use, no one is going to give a shit about you at a federal level. They will leave that to local / highway PD to deal with.

				In the past we could rely on that but they may want to cause paranoia on SR in general by taking out buyers - you never know. In the long run yeah they do want to get the vendors though as buyers have no way up the chain on SR and therefore can&#039;t narc on anyone. The drugs would just keep flowing.<br /><br />QTC would you mind suggesting some of these mixing services? The only intermediary I know of to put coins in from an exchange to SR is instawallet.<br /><br />On the plus side for everyone who is worrying about SR, I think federal agents would be way more concerned with groups like anonymous and other other cyber criminals. Not to say the DEA isn&#039;t all over this<br /><br />Also can someone who knows computer security say if using the green address on instawallet really does anything?

				Thanks! I&#039;ll look into fog...<br /><br />Also wouldn&#039;t you just say you didn&#039;t order anything online and not sign? Yeah it sucks LE might be on to you but at least evidence would be pretty minimal.
