				It really depends on the vendor.&nbsp; Some deal with people with no transactions.&nbsp; Some want you to have five priors.&nbsp; Some want you to have 10 priors.&nbsp; Christy wants you to have several priors and to have been a member for eight months.&nbsp; Every vendor is different.

				I did some cheapo digital transactions to get my grip on SR before I ordered physical. In hindsight it doesn&#039;t really give the vendor any more reason to trust me when I had $5.00 spent on 10 transactions. Apparently the longtime big stat buyers are the worst offenders for scamming anyway, so just be a straight shooter and if a vendor won&#039;t deal with you than oh well, their choice.

				Lot of just depends on the vendor&#039;s gut and the tone you communicate when you first reach out to them. <br />My first transaction on the road involved a top vendor that said buyers with 0 transaction history must FE. I messaged him, explained I was new. We went back and forth a couple times and he said I could order no FE required. I built a good rep with him, and about 10 or so transactions. Then I slowly branched out. <br /><br />Another thing, vendors talk to each other. So if your going to a vendor for the first time and mention how you&#039;ve done a lot of business with XYZ vendor.. theres a good chance that vendor will reach out to XYZ. (this is just me assumption.. vendors might be able to verify this takes place).<br /><br />So build good a rep, and you&#039;ll be &quot;trustworthy&quot; (enough). Nobody is ever 100% trustworthy, but there&#039;s an acceptable level of mitigated risk when a buyer/vendor has what is generally seen as a favorable reputation.<br /><br />The hardest part is the initial few purchases. You run the risk of not being trusted, or being forced to FE (and getting selectively scammed). Glad I&#039;m not a newbie!

				Few transactions and a few hundred spent is fine for me. It&#039;s experience is all. Few transactions means they&#039;ve kinda got it figured out.

				It also depends on what you are selling. Know your clientele<br /><br />I had one buyer this week with 40+ transactions and over 6k spent try to hold my feedback hostage and extort me. I ended up paying him off and losing money.<br /><br />I had another buyer that had been a member for 8 months only 15 transactions $2k spent do something similar because he used a fake address KNOWING he already had product turned away. He demanded a deal or else leave bad feedback.<br /><br />Its hard to tell. Quite frankly the statistics mean nothing to me at this point.

				I think communicating with a vendor helps build trust. I have only had a couple transactions and had one vendor request that I FE and I said no, but communicated with him so that he trusted dealing with me. Some vendors don&#039;t really need your business, they have some regulars and hold high standards... you can&#039;t work with everyone.

				That&#039;s easy. 5 usually, some 10 like [edit.] said. It is getting rare to find vendors who accept no FE for 0 transactions. I wouldn&#039;t, as I believe it is open to abuse.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				If you are looking for statistical significance; that number would be 30 transactions.<br /><br />The number 30 is a result of simple sampling simulations from different parent populations (Uniform, Normal, Exponential, Triangular) and by the time the sample sizes reaches 30-32, the distribution of the means begins to look normal. That is the reason for &quot;30&quot; as the rule-of-thumb.

				Coming from a buyers only perspective. I actually had no problems at all finding a vendor or a few. with literally 0 stats. Its been 9 months since, but nonetheless I had to do a LOT of research before I started ordering.<br />Anyway, My first try for a small amount of H came through with no issues and has been great ever since.<br />
