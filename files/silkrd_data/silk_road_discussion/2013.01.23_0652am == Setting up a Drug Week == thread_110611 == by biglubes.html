				I wouldn&#039;t call it abusing. Would take the normal dose. I am not trying to OD, just trying to switch it up and get wild for a week. Most of those drugs I have never done. @Val&nbsp; The Meth - Heroin back to back nights might be too much lol

				This sounds like a horrible idea. I would spread all these out within the course of&nbsp; month at minimum. <br /><br />You might get burnt out with it all at once like that.

Let him do as he please..&quot; Then I saw this post.. <br />Ok, you should stop even considering this idea until you have thouroughly lost your virginity to each and every one of the listed substances. This sounds arduous and time consuming.. and it will be.. It will be unreal.. it will change you as a human being.. I promise. Keep your head straight, don&#039;t fuck your life up, then come back and rock this week plan like the pro you then will be 8)<br />I&#039;m not being negative or demeaning or anything, I&#039;m just saying that drugs are a serious and often grim business on the whole.. and you definitely must always stay safe above all else... A binge of the type you&#039;re proposing is not safe for a first timer bro.<br />So get out there and get training!<br /><br />Valakiki is on the ball btw&nbsp; ;)
