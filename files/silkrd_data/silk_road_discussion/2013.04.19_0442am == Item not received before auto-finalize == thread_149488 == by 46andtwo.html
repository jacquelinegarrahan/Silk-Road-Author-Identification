				Hi I was just wondering what one should do if the shipment has not come and the autofinalize time is about to expire. I don&#039;t distrust the seller or anything, I just want to have time to give a proper review. (As well as protect myself too I guess) It&#039;s coming a long distance so I think the AF time should have been extended slightly. Any input?

				Check in with the vendor and extend the escrow period 5-10 days. It happens.<br /><br />If it&#039;s not arrived by then, talk to the vendor about a reship or refund. Most are pretty reasonable.

				Are you in contact with the seller? Do they have any kind of tracking info they can supply you with? If no to these, search the forums for the seller&#039;s name, or they might even have their own review thread. Have others gotten burned by him/her recently also or is it a fluke?<br /><br />This just happened to me the other week, and the seller had a 100 rating with many positive comments by many customers both in his feedback as well as these forums. I didnt wanna be the first person to tarnish his record, but he wasn&#039;t replying to any of my messages. I came and made a post just like yours, and someone going through the same thing asked who the seller was. We found out it&#039;s the same one and he hadnt fulfilled any of his recent orders or communicated with anyone. This greatly relieved me that LE or the post office hadnt caught on.<br /><br />But if your seller is communicating and there&#039;s no reason to suspect foul play on their part, ask them if theyre receptive to a partial refund. Then, if it were me, I would probably not have anything shipped to that address again, at least for a time. But that&#039;s me &amp; my paranoia.

				Thanks for the replies all, sent out a message to the seller. Just was wondering if there&#039;s an automated process that I&#039;d be able to do this through. If the seller doesn&#039;t respond in 24 hours, I&#039;ll do the resolve thing. Thanks again, love this community!

				As someone already mentioned, you need to take it to Resolution and request an extension.

				I have one that was is in extension right now.....going on 25 days....went to the far east......so far it&#039;s the only package out of 250 that did not make it before auto finalize.<br /><br />from a vender&#039;s point of view....if your communicating ....I have no problem extending....but mostly customers get their product and then never finalize....which results in auto finalize.....i had 2 of those today.....super frustrating from my point of view....that customers can take a minute or two to hit the button, and make the vender wait 17 days to get their money.
