				Anyone else have their purchasing stats change? Mine dropped to 50%&nbsp; the amount that&nbsp; I have spent. My amount of orders has dropped by 25%. This wouldn&#039;t be an issue except some vendors require a certain amount spent before being able to purchase larger orders. <br /><br />

				I saw another thread about this just recently.&nbsp; I believe an admin replied that DPR decided to change stats by just showing what you&#039;ve done in the last year.&nbsp; So I&#039;m assuming you&#039;ve been on SR for more than a year and that&#039;s why your stats changed.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the real reason why but it is what it is.&nbsp;

				This changed so sellers see supposedly a calculated view of a buyers trends?&nbsp; my concern is history maybe kept or based on prior buyer statistics<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Purchasing_statistics
