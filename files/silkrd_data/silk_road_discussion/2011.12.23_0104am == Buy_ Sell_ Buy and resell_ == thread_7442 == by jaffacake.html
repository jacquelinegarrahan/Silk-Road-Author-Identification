				I was wondering who&#039;s here to buy for personal use, who&#039;s here to sell and who&#039;s here to buy and resell? I want to get a clearer insight on who uses TSR. I&#039;m thinking it might help other people out too if there was a clear indication of the numbers.<br /><br />I&#039;m buying to resell and will likely buy for personal use in the future too.

				<br />a, would love to sell here, my products, specially the THC group would take over the market. I would get more orders than I could handle....the reason I cant sell is due to the small town aspect. It&#039;s always the same motherfuckers in the PO office. Same Fedex guy, same UPS guy ...all it takes is 1 ripped package and I would be fucked. It&#039;s just not worth the risk for me right now. <br /><br />b, there is&nbsp; tons of money to make here though... if u don&#039;t see it, honestly ur really not in the game. People still pay $20-$25 for e&#039;s and cid and in the clubs.&nbsp; There are places in Europe where people will drop 200 EUR for a gram of fishscale, just as an example. Also it depends on many aspects such as the qty ur selling. If you&#039;r selling 20 bags packed with .8 grams of medicinal, ur still profiting regardless where u buying from.&nbsp; The prices here don&#039;t bother me. Bitcoin fluctuations during long transfer times, that&#039;s a killer.<br /><br />c, the single best thing about this site though is the drop ship aspect.&nbsp; Drop shipping pharmaceuticals on an international level is just pure future and the way to go. Never carry inventory.... u never meet the buyer or the seller and money is laundered through bitcoin... just fucking beautiful.&nbsp; If you know what you are doing, this can be the best work from home job ever.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any type of drugs via mouse-click, delivered vacuum sealed right to your door step....Silkroad gives u a real taste of the future. It&#039;s drug trade - online - the next generation ... all of us are making history right now. Same of us don&#039;t even know it. <br /><br />I am proud to be part of it and I will follow Silk Road to hell&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Buy, Sell, Buy and Resell .... whatever it takes!!!<br /><br /><br />

				^^^<br /><br />Great post. In regards to prices being to much to resell, I think it depends on what you want to resell. Currently I&#039;m here for E in pill form. I can buy ten from premiumdutch for approximately £50. I can sell them, to friends and friends of friends for £10 each. %100 profit.<br /><br />Maybe there&#039;s a need for wholesale sellers on TSR?

				I do wholesale off of here, but not to people who are trying to resell online.&nbsp; You can get a pretty fantastic margin in a lot of the US and EU on my prices (I have the benefit of being in Canada where the quality/price of cannabis is probably one of the best on the planet).

				I mainly make purchases for myself, but I have been reselling some bulk MDXX I&#039;ve bought. I&#039;ve gotten to the point where I rarely spend money from my paycheck on substances anymore.

				If you want to make real $$$$$ bring in some bulk coke, h, acid, or mdma into Australia and in a year or 2 you&#039;ll be lying on a beach in the caymans.

				Or in a prison getting to better know your cellmate. :&#039;(<br /><br />Acid doesn&#039;t seem that hard. You could soak a bible and take it in carry on. It should work for smuggling and dosing potent synthetic opiates like fentanyl too. Are dogs trained to detect these? Coke, MDMA, and H are too bulky and risky for me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about buying here and reselling. It&#039;s worth it for a few things, but I don&#039;t want to step on any seller&#039;s toes without first making sure they&#039;re fine with me redistributing their goods on SR. Some do it already.

				The only opportunities I have really seen for reselling here are a few of the weed vendors, and some benzos if you purchase in bulk and usually from overseas.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe if I were in high school I would have an easier time flipping some of these products for a profit but I am already paying a premium on everything offered here for convenience and security!<br /><br />As if it wasn&#039;t obvious... I am here purchasing for personal use :)
