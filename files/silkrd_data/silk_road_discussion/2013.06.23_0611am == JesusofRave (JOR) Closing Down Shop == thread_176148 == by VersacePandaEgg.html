				Just went on JOR&#039;s vendor page and was stunned to read this: <br /><br />&lt;CLOSING DOWN&gt;<br />We will be closing the shop on the 24/06/13<br /><br />Everything ordered before then will be sent....<br /><br />It&#039;s been fun - we will likely come back every so often, like 3Jane and other legends BUT for the time being we have no set plans for when we will be relisting...<br /><br />Thank all of you. We love you all, but will only now be answering questions relating to current orders.<br /><br />Any future plans will be communicated via our thread in the forum.<br /><br /><br /><br />Unfortunately I never got the chance to place an order with em... :&#039;(<br />

				You still have 2 days to place an order with him! <br /><br />I am cashing all my BTC in my account in on him. I&#039;d rather have to sit on it for a while than go with #2 for his MDMA. His product quality is absolutely the best, JOR will certainly be missed here.&nbsp; :-\

				Im not trying to be rude here. He seems to have excellent product (MDMA) but he also seems to be very slow with shipping. I wanted to buy from him but when I saw complains about delivery time then im not sure. Maybe I should would go with another vendor. Dont know which vendor has comparable MDMA?<br /><br />Sorry again JoR. Hope we see you again soon :)

				It seems JOR is spooked, either&nbsp; that or he has had a heads up on some clandestine operation. If you have been nicked let us know. There must be a reason you&#039;re off.<br /><br />Why not announce it on forum and have a sale. ?<br /><br />I wish you all the luck in any future endeavours&nbsp; you choose to partake in.

				It doesn&#039;t necessarily sound like he was spooked, just wants to go out on top. Makes sense to me. I&#039;m sure he&#039;s made a boatload of money &amp; is still doing fine. But, once you&#039;re on top &amp; in the limelight, the only direction to go is down. If I were in his position, I could easily see myself doing the exact same thing.

				A wise decision. At 100-200k a month there&#039;s really no need to go further than a 3-4 months. Everything you have gotten you deserve, JOR. Truly one of the best to have ever contributed to our thing. Respectful, intelligent, humble, even while holding the #1 spot, JOR is truly a role model for us all.<br /><br />Adieu, my friend. It has truly been a pleasure to have you here.

				I was only able to have one order with JOR, and it seems that now is not the right time for me to be ordering his product.&nbsp; He certainly left an impression.&nbsp; Hoping that other vendors will follow his exemplary methods.

				Smart vendor...<br /><br />Shuts up shop for a bit...<br /><br />Invests money earned in legit areas...<br /><br />The name JOR slowly dissolves into the background... Out of site, out of mind...<br /><br />Opens shop under new name and repeats...
