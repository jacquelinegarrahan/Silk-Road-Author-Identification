				An incorporated company, as in a legal entity who issues invoices, pays taxes, employs staff etc will do whatever the fuck they are told to do by the law as a general rule of thumb. There are exceptions to this but they are just that, exceptions.<br /><br />If you have a commercial VPN provider then, unless they are very new to the game and have not yet been burnt and had their hands slapped, they will keep logs and they will hand them straight over to LEO - in some countries they might ask to see a warrant first. In general if LEO ask them to free up a switch port and 2U for the proverbial &#039;black box&#039; then they will and they won&#039;t say a word about it to you or any of their other customers. It really does happen all the time.<br /><br />Commercial VPNs are secured against many attackers but not against the type who carry badges and [warrants/guns]*<br /><br />* delete as appropriate<br />
