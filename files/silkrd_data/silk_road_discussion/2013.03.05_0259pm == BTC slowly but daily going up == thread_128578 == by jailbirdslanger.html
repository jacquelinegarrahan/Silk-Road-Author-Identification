				I have noticed over the last few days that my acct with a small amount in it as usual, has gone up a 30 cents or more a day over the last 72 hours. I got a few bills on me and was thinking maybe I should put this on the SR books. Does this kinda steady up lift in the BTC value normally happen like this (steady rise no revert)? I was talking to someone who put me on to SR and he was so shocked that BTC is up to 31 where it was at like 13 or something early 2K12.<br /><br />Let me know whats up

				I&#039;m staring at it right now and it&#039;s at $41.75. As long as vendors are keeping the items they sell attached to USD, or keeping them manually updated, I&#039;m 110% fine with it. But yeah, this BTC thing is insane. Just in September it was hovering around $10-$13/btc.

				Yeah, bitcoin value is definitely going up, but &quot;slowly&quot; couldn&#039;t be a worse descriptor. The price is skyrocketing! Compared to normal currencies and stocks this is crazy growth. I don&#039;t know much about the technical aspect of bitcoins, but I&#039;m pretty sure their rate of generation was severely slowed down at the start of the year (maybe halved if I&#039;m not mistaken). Obviously that cuts down on the supply, so if that&#039;s the case I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a big factor in the price rise.

				There&#039;s new ASIC mining hardware that is becoming mainstream now, so even though the payouts were halved in November, the rate of generation will still increase, and GPU mining will be totally worthless.<br /><br />That being said, there is a TON of speculation over at bitcointalk.org about if/when this bubble will burst.&nbsp; The general consensus seems to be that the price will drop eventually, but given the current rate of adoption, the drop will most likely steady out, rather than tank like it did in 2011.&nbsp; The question of *when* this will happen, or *what* the price will steady out to is anybody&#039;s guess though.<br /><br />I bought in @ $22 per coin about a month ago, and again last week, but I&#039;ve just been watching the dollar value of my coins skyrocket and resisting the urge to make any SR purchases.&nbsp; Can&#039;t say I&#039;m disappointed--my holdings went up $1000 in the last 24 hours!<br /><br />Vendors must also be loving this upswing.&nbsp; The guys who were spending 4BTC for an eighth of bud 2 weeks ago effectively paid their vendor close to $200 each @ today&#039;s price!&nbsp; Who knows how far this will go?
