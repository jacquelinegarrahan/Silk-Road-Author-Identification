There are only a few that use flash trading and black boxes to make money but the majority of the others have a longer time horizon, somewhere between 3-12months. Some hedge funds have been in the spotlight the last few years over their use of &quot;expert networks&quot; - basically they were paying insiders at companies&nbsp; to &#039;consult&#039; them about their companies... yeah, basically insider trading and another reason you&#039;ll lose in the market.<br /><br />You are incorrect about short selling - anyone can do that with any online brokerage. The majority of my trades are on the short side but i highly recommend that you don&#039;t try it because unlike on the buy side where you can only lose your original investment, on the sell side you can lose an infinite amount of money.<br /><br />Basically if you are an individual investor your best best is to average into some index funds and keep them tucked away. Timing the market is very difficult but it&#039;s best to buy when others are fearful and sell when others are greedy.
