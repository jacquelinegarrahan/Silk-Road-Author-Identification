				New member here. I&#039;ve placed a four &quot;real&quot; orders so far.&nbsp; Three are in transit (I&#039;m impatiently waiting.) The remaining order has been in process for almost 7 days.&nbsp; It is not a large order. The listing has not been removed, so I presume the product is still in stock. The vendor is highly rated and has been here for a while. However, they won&#039;t reply to messaging and haven&#039;t provided an indication of when the order will shipped. <br /><br />My question is: What is a fair amount of time to wait before canceling an order?&nbsp; I don&#039;t need the order at any particular date, but if they are going to take forever I&#039;d rather retreive my BTCs and pursue another vendor. <br /><br />Thanks

				If I remember correctly, you need to wait 3 days to be able to cancel an order right? <br /><br />If I have an order in processing for 3 days with no word from the vendor I would definitely cancel it.

				Yep, I think it is three days too. I&#039;ve had the ability to cancel for while. I just didn&#039;t know if there was some unwritten rule regarding a reasonable time to wait. Oh well, I&#039;ll probably cancel by EOD.

				It&#039;s four days. If he hasn&#039;t shipped and does not reply, just cancel it. Serves him right.<br /><br />BB
