In my 7+ years of using Pills/Molly, they are hands down the best I&#039;ve had. <br /><br />It was like my first time all over again. They are better than all the others, the squirells, defqons, tri-force, speaker. Was actually confused as to how good they are. <br /><br />There is something other than Molly in them as well, but it only makes it better. MDA is my though as I had insane up and down eye wiggles, and I only get that from using MDA.

				My experience has been that the Nintendo&#039;s from TheHeineken (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d331e1b87f) have been top notch. They run at 200mg + which is the perfect dose for me and the wife, although a bit much for someone new to the drug. His packaging is perfect and gets here on time every time.<br /><br />Normally I shy away from pills just because it&#039;s so hard to know what you are actually getting but I actually prefer these to most powders just because the last three orders I have done for them have been so predictably consistent. <br /><br />Last note, the Nintendo&#039;s have been lab tested (CLEARNET - http://www.ecstasydata.org/) which at least means the sample they got was just MDMA with none of the other junk in there.

				Aidoneus is a great domestic vendor (the one and only).&nbsp; Otherwise look to Germany, you might have trouble with stuff getting seized if you order from the Netherlands.<br /><br />lelmeriodic

The Nitendo&#039;s are amazing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had the purple PF&#039;s before, and half of a Nitendo is better than one whole PF, but then again i could have had a bad batch, who knows..<br /><br />They are great quality, i still have one left from months ago, their that good i&#039;m holding onto it. I bought it domestic, but would love to order a stash for future use. :P<br /><br />Not sure about the Grenades...should be something on pillreport about them maybe?

				jnemonic!<br /><br />I saw your signature and feaked lol.<br /><br />What time is love? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;dedhead69<br /><br />There was someone else who had a bad review of the Purple Party Flocks over the weekend. Said they took them at Ultra and were puking their guts out the entire time ( as well as other unsavory effects ). So its not the first bad review on them. <br /><br />Personally I try and order molly and stay away from pills.&nbsp; But obviously your going the more traditional route of distribution and or ingestion. <br /><br />I agree with AV in that international is probably the best bet! I got burned on my domestic purchase as well and when I ordered international they came through like a champ. <br />

Ivory is a legend among kings. Have purchased about 3oz worth of mdma off him/her in the last couple of months, and everything is A+ Packaging, comms are both 5/5.<br /><br />Yes, Ivory&#039;s gear is a little more expensive than most, but considering the consistent quality and the fact they ship from the UK, Im extremeley happy :)

				Yeah the 2 PF&#039;s i had were terrible, was not impressed, but i was just unlucky. I heard the new Space Monkeys are very nice.<br /><br />But yeah if an aussie vendor had Nitendos here, i would happily pay $30-$40 a pill, there worth every cent. ;)
