				Generally UPS stores or other mailbox rental stores have proven legit in my experience with shipping. Search for mailbox rental around you and choose one that is not corporate. Check it out and see if the people working there seem cool and not too nosey. I would avoid a USPS PO box if you are in the US or any type of federal PO box in the UK. Otherwise, you should be safe. <br /><br /><br />However, I don&#039;t know how much getting on camera will affect you. If shit is going to go down. They will do a controlled delivery and get you when you try to pick it up.&nbsp; It would take some extraneous circumstances for this to happen, anyway. Just keep your wits about you.<br /><br />I am open to hearing criticism or learning something new if anyone else has experience.<br /><br />
