Prohibition doesn&#039;t work! I would have thought someone who probably has first-hand experience on the futility of drug prohibition would realise how ineffective gun prohibition would be. Think about this; you&#039;re a criminal organisation who needs guns, are you going to just not use them because the law says you can&#039;t? Nope. When you take away guns from ordinary citizens then all you have is a population which cannot defend themselves from the criminals who WILL have guns - law or no law.<br /><br />Second flaw. Assuming the criminals decide they don&#039;t want guns (amateur criminals only and the &#039;chavs&#039; as you call them) because of the legality of them and the supposed increase in difficulty to obtain them are they just gonna decide they don&#039;t want to be armed? Nope. They will just use many other legal weapons, knives, tasers, baseball bats hell some people just use their car as a lethal weapon.<br /><br />Third flaw. A gun can&#039;t physically kill somebody on its own. It&#039;s impossible. A gun has to be fired by someone (assuming you don&#039;t make any ridiculous counter-arguments like a faulty gun going off on it&#039;s own - which would be a retarded argument to make) which means guns don&#039;t kill people, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE.<br /><br />Sounds like you have a lot to learn about the world.

				I live in the UK and the thought of some of the people in my street having easy access to firearms is horrifying.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there&#039;s the odd nutter with a gun but it&#039;s just not an issue.<br /><br />Another important point is that if gun laws were relaxed, it&#039;d most likely mean the police would have to be armed, which is something no one wants to see.

				piers morgan might be a bellend but that alex jones bloke is a&nbsp; complete lunatic, I feel a lot safer and happier knowing the majority of guns in the UK belong to criminals and they generally use them against other criminals, not a bunch of kids in a school or cinema.<br /><br />they took our guuuuuuns&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />this was the best quote<br /><br />&quot;1776 will commence again&quot; what a complete loon.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been to the states a few times and know a few americans living in the UK and they are lovely people, but can you blame europeans for thinking americans are dumb when you have people like alex jones??<br /><br />

				I have to ask anyone who is a supporter of gun prohibition and uses the gun ban in the UK as an example of success this.<br /><br />If it is a success then why are there an average of 35 gun deaths per year?&nbsp; I thought the guns were banned.&nbsp; Banning guns<br />does not stop gun deaths nor does it stop violent crime.<br /><br />As an aside, violent crime is much higher in the UK than in the US.&nbsp; In the US, most gun deaths are gang related and ultimately<br />because of drug prohibition.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do not believe that we need to have a gun debate at all.&nbsp; We need to have a real discussion about violent crime and its root cause.<br />A discussion based on fact using logic and critical thinking.&nbsp; Unfortunately that is NEVER going to happen in America.&nbsp; Maybe around the dinner table<br />but it will stop there.<br /><br />

People seem to forget what the right to bear arms was implemented for. Not to protect yourself from burglars and murderers (although that&#039;s an added bonus) but to ensure that if a tyrant came to power he would be put down. There&#039;s something about an armed government telling me to give up my guns that doesn&#039;t sit well with me. As one man so eloquently put it &quot;I am willing to die to protect my 2nd amendment, are you willing to die to take it away?&quot;

				Piers Morgan is a buffoon can&#039;t stand him and his attention seeking ways. The guy doesn&#039;t give two shits about anything but a shocking headline that leads to higher ratings than his normal boring ass show. Take this shithead back to the UK please. <br /><br />As far as the &quot;gun&quot; issue I&#039;ve never had a problem or known of a problem personally. I probably have 30 weapons ranging from hunting rifles/shotguns, collector items, and a few pistols for target practice. I don&#039;t have a conceal and carry permit but I&#039;ve thought about getting one just so I don&#039;t have the hassle of transporting to the range. My father made me go through many safety courses before getting my first weapon and then guided me through some of the best times of my life when we hunted together. Imagine that, a parent taking responsibility for a child and teaching them the proper way to respect weapons. My opinion, there are too many laws and restrictions already. Do we really need our governments to take over parental responsibilities or your personal judgements? These are the same fk sticks who say you can&#039;t smoke Marijuana because we don&#039;t want you to.<br /><br />I love people from around the world but when it comes to advice - please worry about your own country....there&#039;s plenty to keep you busy there :P

				Mainstream media jaggoffs like Piers Morgan are being paid to spew the dogma of corporations and politicians who own the media. While I have found AJ&#039;s documentaries informative, it is unclear if he is playing the part of the &quot;loon&quot; that nobody wants to be like. Think Pro-wrestling. Is he being used to make anyone who questions the government to look like a tinfoil hat nut? It is hard to say.<br /><br />However, due to emerging evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that there was knowledge of the Sandy Hook shooting before it happened. (There were charity websites set up before the day it went down.) Which would lead a reasonable person to conclude that there is a much more sinister plot at work. The crisis actors seen on the news, the contradicting eyewitness accounts and contradicting early reports confirm the flaws in the official story. This also goes for the massacre in the Aurora movie theatre. There are multiple eye witnesses claiming that there was someone that opened the door for the shooter. One can&#039;t easily &quot;kick in&quot; a move theater door that opens outward as the official narrative suggests. The lone-wolf gunman story does not make sense. It has been also noted that the fathers of both shooters had high ranking positions in finance. The Aurora shooter&#039;s father worked for FICO, a credit research company, and was allegedly supposed to testify against banking fraud. I know that the father of the most recent shooter was the vice president of GE capital bank. Very recently as well, MSNBC posted an article on their website about a 43 trillion dollar lawsuit brought against the banks for fraud by Spire Law Group LLC. The very next day, the vice president of MSNBC&#039;s children were murdered under suspicious circumstances. According to the media, the nanny lost her shit and stabbed two toddlers to death. Almost needless to say, the article was taken down the next day.<br /><br />Kinda makes you wonder doesn&#039;t it?

				For those of you not versed in America&#039;s founding fathers and how the 2nd Amendment came to be -- and the left-wing media tries to keep our citizens ignorant of this<br />fact -- guns were not permitted so the people could hunt; they were meant to protect the citizens against a tyrannical government.&nbsp; That seemed fairly far-fetched just<br />four years ago, but increasingly possible with all the power grab the Feds have been doing.&nbsp; Forget this petty talk about &quot;assault weapons.&quot;&nbsp; I say the citizens should be allowed any arms the government has, and that<br />includes the military.&nbsp; I would hate to have to use pea-shooters against scud missiles.&nbsp; The best defense against an armed tyrannical government is an equally armed citizenry.

While I have found AJ&#039;s documentaries informative, it is unclear if he is playing the part of the &quot;loon&quot; that nobody wants to be like. Think Pro-wrestling. Is he being used to make anyone who questions the government to look like a tinfoil hat nut? It is hard to say.<br /><br />However, due to emerging evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that there was knowledge of the Sandy Hook shooting before it happened. (There were charity websites set up before the day it went down.) Which would lead a reasonable person to conclude that there is a much more sinister plot at work. The crisis actors seen on the news, the contradicting eyewitness accounts and contradicting early reports confirm the flaws in the official story. This also goes for the massacre in the Aurora movie theatre. There are multiple eye witnesses claiming that there was someone that opened the door for the shooter. One can&#039;t easily &quot;kick in&quot; a move theater door that opens outward as the official narrative suggests. The lone-wolf gunman story does not make sense. It has been also noted that the fathers of both shooters had high ranking positions in finance. The Aurora shooter&#039;s father worked for FICO, a credit research company, and was allegedly supposed to testify against banking fraud. I know that the father of the most recent shooter was the vice president of GE capital bank. Very recently as well, MSNBC posted an article on their website about a 43 trillion dollar lawsuit brought against the banks for fraud by Spire Law Group LLC. The very next day, the vice president of MSNBC&#039;s children were murdered under suspicious circumstances. According to the media, the nanny lost her shit and stabbed two toddlers to death. Almost needless to say, the article was taken down the next day.<br /><br />Kinda makes you wonder doesn&#039;t it?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No, it does not. Unless there is factual evidence backing up anything you just said.&nbsp; It is extremely common for there to be contradicting eyewitnesses and early reports after a horrific violent crime. And perfectly understandable given the circumstances.

I mean look at who he had to talk to, an idiot with a bigger mouth than his who is a piece of shit sedition committing scum.&nbsp; We will revolt. Period!

				A gun is just a collection of appropriate shaped pieces of the appropriate material (metal).<br />The pieces fit together and can fire ammunition which is metal(s) and other chemicals.<br /><br />We in the UK should be encouraged to learn how to make our own guns in the garage or workshop.<br /><br />I personally could not be trusted with a gun. <br />99.9999% of the time I would be just fine, no one would get shot.<br />It&#039;s just that 0.0001% of the time when I would go a bit overboard and might shoot people.<br />Don&#039;t think I really would kill any body, but I don&#039;t want to have that opportunity/risk.<br /><br />So I would rather have a stockpile of ammunition alongside the ability, machinery and materials to make one should the need arise.<br />The need to have a gun would be serious shit.

				The gun debate in America is ridiculous. The right to own a gun is guaranteed to every US citizen, and that will not, or should not change. This right is not just so Americans can hunt, the true reason it is there is so citizens have the means to defend themselves against the government, end of story.<br /><br />The fact that American&#039;s can have guns is not responsible for the recent massacres, just the same how violent video games and violent movies and violent books are not responsible for the recent massacres. The lunatics who killed all those people are the ones who are responsible for the recent massacres. End of story.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t understand why this isn&#039;t common sense. I don&#039;t get why people don&#039;t realize that in a free society people are free to do what they want, and that once in a while you will have a disturbed asshole who is going to do something crazy, there is not much anyone can do about that. Is the government going to outlaw matches if some sick asshole burns down a building, killing hundreds of innocent people? No, because the matches didn&#039;t burn down the building, the sick asshole did, it is the same thing with guns.<br /><br />Canada is HUGE on guns, and they play the same violent video games, watch the same violent movies, and read the same violent books as Americans, but their murder rate is nowhere near that of the USA. This shows that an armed population is not the cause of gun violence, it is something else. Maybe it is something in the water, who knows, but you can&#039;t blame the tragedy on the tool that was used. The sickle didn&#039;t harvest the crops, the farmer did. The gun didn&#039;t shoot up the school, the gunman did. <br /><br />Bottom line, people are stupid and unreasonable and just won&#039;t gracefully accept the fact that sometimes people snap and tragedies happen. If you really want to try to prevent this from happening in the future, you need to help out the well being of the population. As the economy struggles and more and more young people are crushed by debt and unable to settle down and find a job and support a family and live the life they were told they could have their whole lives, violence like this is going to be on the rise. That is human nature in action.

He won’t be able to get that gun into my classroom, because it’s a gun free zone!” When even the people that support ‘gun free’ zones don’t attempt to deny their ineffectiveness, you wonder why they persist in the belief that they’re a necessity. They’ve admitted that such zones don’t keep the “bad guys with guns” out, but they’re still too afraid of the “good guys with guns” to abolish the zones. Ironic.<br /><br />News flash: bad guys with guns don&#039;t obey laws!!&nbsp; The kid in Newtown broke 40+ laws and didn&#039;t give a damn.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; He was crazy and was hell-bent on causing destruction (if the official story is to be believed, but that is another can of worms).&nbsp; My assumption is that people who hate guns and want them banned have been conditioned to believe that way for one reason or another.&nbsp; A gun is a tool, an object that can do nothing on it&#039;s own.&nbsp; It can be used for good or evil.&nbsp; Outlawing guns simply because they look scary is one of the most asinine things I&#039;ve ever heard.&nbsp; You can thank Sen. Feinstein for that one.

				Crazy people and criminals are not going to go through any sort of legal process in order to obtain a gun. If they want weapons bad enough they&#039;re going to find a way to obtain them. Maybe I&#039;m over simplifying things a bit, but I&#039;m going to assume that the Bloods (sp?) and the Cripes do not register their guns.<br /><br />For example, I joined silkroad because I wanted &quot;easy&quot; access to drugs. I wanted the freedom to experiment with mind altering substances despite the fact that the illicit drugs that I have ordered are illegal. Silkroad provided me a way to access many drugs that are too difficult to obtain in my small town.&nbsp; In my opinion, the same logic can be applied to gun control. <br /><br />Where there&#039;s a will there&#039;s a way. The individuals responsible for the shootings didn&#039;t go from normal to crazy overnight. I agree with the poster who said that prevention is key. Instead of spending tax dollars on free birth control why not instead use that money to provide easier access to quality mental healthcare screenings/treatment. <br /><br />The government and insurance companies do not provide healthcare, instead they provide sickcare. Only when something goes terrible wrong (physically or mentally) does any action take place and when it does, only the bare minimum is provided. Had this kid been provided with high quality mental healthcare maybe the result would&#039;ve been different. Parents: if you knew that your kid was a little &quot;off&quot; or mentally ill, would you let him have access to the gun safe combination? I think most would respond with a definite and firm NO. <br />

				&nbsp;:o<br /><br />I&#039;m really shocked to see the anti-gun sentiment so strong in a community like this one. I though we were all about personal responsibility, personal independence, and true freedom. I guess I gave too many the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t think people have the right to defend themselves, or you think the police and government are more trustworthy than citizens with firearms then you aren&#039;t thinking logically.<br /><br />If you fear your neighbors having access to deadly weapons then I pity you. The fact of the matter is the people who you should be afraid of have access to those weapons regardless of their legality, and even without firearms a person who wants to harm people will find a way.<br /><br />If your neighbor doesn&#039;t fly off the handle and bash people with a tire iron or baseball bat, then they won&#039;t go around killing people with a gun. A gun does not change a person, they will do whatever they wish with the tools available to them.<br /><br />To setup a system where police and military are armed and citizens are not is in fact tyranny. Whether an iron fist or a velvet glove is used, it is still tyranny. Plus, you never know when the glove will be taken off.

				Our rights are RIGHTS, and if you stand up for any of them, you need to stand up for all of them. <br /><br />1st amendment - do you think there should be freedom of speech on the internet (yes, obviously)? Founding fathers obviously didn&#039;t envision the internet, so does &quot;speech&quot; even apply? You are typing after all, not talking.<br />Against bullying of protesters a la occupy wall st, or other actions that abridge the right &quot;of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances&quot;?<br /><br />4th amendment - are you against police and federal law enforcement searches without warrants? stop and frisk police behavior? warrantles wiretapping (internet spying)?<br /><br />5th amendment - are you against indefinite detention of detainees without trial? Ever chose to not incriminate yourself when questioned by police (aka plead the 5th).<br /><br />And the list goes on and on. If you agree with these types of things but are favorable to gun control, you are a hypocrite and need to re-evaulate your views.<br />

				It was nice to see Piers fuck up and have an intelligent person on to debate this weapons issue. Watch the debate with Ben Shapiro and Piers on YouTube from last night if you want to see Piers tactics. It&#039;s funny how far off the people are who think banning &quot;assault rifles&quot; is going to fix anything and let themselves be convinced by idiots like Piers Morgan. I&#039;m sure he will dig up lesser opponents to debate from now after this beating.

Wouyld suck to be an american white trash male with a mindset from the 1950s living in the 2013 USA.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I live in Thailand.&nbsp; On April the 10th, 2010 the Thai government fired on participants and protests in a public gathering and 24 people were murdered.&nbsp; During the 2010 protests over 80 people died.&nbsp; Yes governments do get out of control.&nbsp; <br /><br />To the north of me is Laos.&nbsp; Read up.<br /><br />To the east of me is Cambodia, then Vietnam.&nbsp; Read up.<br /><br />To the west of me is Burma.&nbsp; Don&#039;t read up- it&nbsp; will just break your heart.<br /><br />Guns might well be dangerous.&nbsp; But nothing on this planet is as deadly as a government.&nbsp; I do not see arming civilians as a solution to combating the power of government...I see arming civilians as the only solution to combating the power of government.&nbsp; If you think that somehow modern Western nations are peace-loving institutions for the benefit of man you are one ignorant fuck.&nbsp; No, let me correct that.&nbsp; Your statements alone show that you are one ignorant fuck.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well said.&nbsp; And I&#039;m sorry for your turmoil.<br /><br />In your opinion, if the citizens of Thailand had the right to bear arms, do you think these government&nbsp; massacres would take place?&nbsp; Even if the citizens of Thailand had vastly inferior firepower to what the government might have, do you think that would be enough to prevent the massacres?&nbsp; <br /><br />Let&#039;s say a the citizens are armed with hunting rifles, shotguns, pistols, semi-auto rifles and the occasional full auto firearm.&nbsp; The government is armed with it&#039;s standard Type 11 and HK 33assault rifles (not to mention artillery, etc etc).&nbsp; Would peaceful protests occur without interference from the government since the government knows if they fire on the protestors there is a chance of them firing back, and even more so there is the chance of all the citizens rising up against them since they are armed?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m just curious to see what others think about this.

				I find it really kind of interesting that there are people on this site who think gun prohibition is a good idea.<br />Isn&#039;t that ironic...&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I mean, what? we are gonna ban guns right.&nbsp; Then only the bad guys will have guns, kind of like drugs.<br /><br />I guess if we really like black markets then sure, but the quickest way to increase crime is to make things<br />people enjoy illegal.&nbsp; Maybe the prison lobby is looking to increase profits.<br /><br />

				Every UK citizen should have a gun. This gun should be buried or locked in some kind of safe.<br />It can only be used to one day overthrow the government if necessary.<br />If you are found carrying your gun or using it in anyway other than overthrowing government, you shall be imprisoned or killed.<br /><br />This should be enshrined in law. It is a right. It is a balance of power.

If we had relaxed gun laws here we&#039;d be as fucked as America is.... Don&#039;t get me wrong i like the American people just not the government (like ours is any better) but honestly i agree with Piers something does need to be done about gun laws over there (I still think they should have weapons but there should be limits to what guns and ammo you can actually have)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here is a question for you if you have more relaxed gun laws don&#039;t you think that you would have less suicide bombings in America we do not have suicide bombings we only have cowards who get on vehicles i.e. airplanes where guns are not allowed I would like to the see those sons of bitches step onto a city bus and tried to do his jhad crap&nbsp; They might get the bomb triggered off&nbsp; But&nbsp; they would Also be shot<br /><br />I agree American gun laws are screwed up there should be Mandatory for you to take the gun safety lessons to own a gun and if you have a Nonviolent felony criminal record you should be made to go through.Extensive gun training and should not be allowed a concealed weapons permit for first two years of gun ownership or something along this line.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have a violent criminal record of any kind tuff shit no gun for you <br /><br />If everybody had a gun you would think twice about robbing anybody. How do you know grandma doesn&#039;t have a 45 tucked away in her girder if there were no gun laws then most criminals would assume that most victims are armed.<br /><br />(We need to arm the people not the criminals right now the criminals have more guns than the people this should be the other way around)<br /><br />Like the old West and I don&#039;t want somebody come on here spooling off about how wild the West was because if you read the real history books the West was quite tame and almost all historians will agree this was because everybody had a gun.<br /><br />We have several Counties in America that this analogy has been proven <br /><br />These counties have relaxed There conceal weapons laws and allowed anybody without a felony to easily obtain a concealed weapons permit <br /><br />And&nbsp; guess what in just one year the crime rate for this Counties plummeted On the average 61%.<br /><br />If you outlaw guns you Will get what you have&nbsp; in your country now.<br /><br />The only people who have guns are your police your military the rich and criminals.<br /><br />what happens if your country decides to in Stowe unrealistic taxes and Laws on its citizens let me rephrase that on all of its un-armed citizens what would you do at this point and you are completely Out of touch with today&#039;s reality to think that this would not happen.<br /><br />Only stupid people do stupid things with guns. <br /><br />It is Not the gun that&#039;s killing the person It&#039;s the person holding the gun Or the moron who doesn&#039;t understand how to own a gun proper storage safety features installed on gun when stored etc. etc..<br /><br />As an American I would fight to my dying breath To protect my rights to take up arms And defend myself against foreign or domestic enemies

				People of some nations seem to handle their guns just fine. Traditional English folk would probably be fine with the correct training. Trouble is, this country is changing. Too much wannabee gang culture, racial tensions, violent inner city areas etc.<br />Guns would make some areas more dangerous.<br /><br />America is scary.

				I don&#039;t know what to make of the NRA. Imagine if a Muslim state were to bring out an app for kids to teach them how to shoot and use guns? Can you imagine loud mouth Americans are the crap they would be sprouting? The western media SHOULD be holding the NRA to task but as we can see the NRA is just another protected arm of the NWO. <br /><br />Why do the NRA have so much fucken power that they can dismiss what is essentially a critical debate in a country that has lost so many innocent people due to guns. I mean to come out and say the things these NWO sponsored arseholes have been saying and getting away with under the guise of the &quot;xx amendment&quot; is a fucken insult to democracy and the whole concept of it.<br /><br />I can only imagine the shitstorm by the NWO sponsored western media if al queeda decided to release the same app.<br /><br />And you yanks wonder why we hate you so much.<br /><br />Now come at me with some bullshit speak about needing guns to protect yourselfs from tyrant governments.

I&#039;m sure there&#039;s the odd nutter with a gun but it&#039;s just not an issue.<br /><br />Another important point is that if gun laws were relaxed, it&#039;d most likely mean the police would have to be armed, which is something no one wants to see.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OK this looks interesting,myself I have many friends in the US and I feel terrible for them the goverments as close to a dictatorship as it can be without the stupid sheep realising it because they&#039;re all to damn busy watching some 5 year kid and his pet sausage dog roll fucking ping pong balls around a stage for 3 minutes,when the UK found out about the BS over the WMD we pretty much booted the goverment out what happened there he got another term,the slimy ass bastard should never have been president in the first place,but it does help if your daddy&#039;s G HW Bush and your brother is the governor of the swing state you need to win and the vote counter is also your campaign manager,I&#039;ll get on topic in a minute i&#039;ve not forgot what i&#039;m talking about,but that country is going down the shitter faster than last nights curry,and my wife lives there so once she&#039;s out they can please them selves what they do the crooked bastards.<br />So back to gun laws i dont know what piers morgan said i dont really watch much sci-fi,but i&#039;ll go look and if the point I make in the next paragraph needs revising i will do so.<br />If any citizen of any country can tell me what they need an automatic weapon for i&#039;ll shut my mouth,but you must be able to comeback with a complete consise answer because in my eyes there is no need for anything that is more useful for killing people than it is for hunting food,,,Whoa slow down I know whats coming,,But guns dont kill people people kill people,but people couldn&#039;t kill people with automatic weapons if they wernt available,a handgun for personal defence is acceptable but it must be kept in a secure place at all times with an empty chamber, a shotgun or small to medium caliber rifle for hunting dear and wild boar,but there is no good reason to sell automatic weapons to the public anything other than the affore mentioned guns and rifles arnt safe to no be nor is it acceptable to sell any automatic weapons to anybody that isnt trained to use them I.E Army,whatever but not in public hands,we dont have the problem of an over growing wild boar population and there isnt such an influx of deer to shoot either so we dont really have much use for any gun of anykind in the UK and i&#039;m glad about that atleast i know i&#039;m at a very tiny risk of gunshot and knife attacks because if you give 1 of the chavvy twats a good slap pick the biggest and back hand him like a little school girl,personally if the risk of life in jail wasnt so high i&#039;de just shoot the wanker but that&#039;s me,but aint nobody gonna tell me that they need auto weapons for self use.<br />God Bless The Little Angels and theyre teachers,,Come on USA your supposed to be the greatest power in the world yet alot of your citizens still live in abject poverty,you trade prisoners on the stock market like cattle and your just trying to get 1 more young disadvantaged kid in that meat cart,you let you people suffer by refusing them heathcare for all but you do it with scare tactics your perfectly happy to run a socialised anything unless it can make money then it has to be private,otherwise why is a federal postal service good or the police or the fire servive,you scare your citizens into beleiving its bad because most of them wont look at the WHO tables and see the USA is worse than Israel a country at war for decades there&#039;s a fault somewhere and im trying to find it but i feel like its the search for the 100th monkey and im just waiting for people to wake up.<br />Rage Over<br />My Fingers Ache Somebody Roll Me A Joint<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;m guessing you must not know a whole lot about the U.S.&nbsp; Fully automatic guns of any kind are already illegal.&nbsp; Our moron president is proposing to ban semi-automatic rifles (which is most of the rifles out there), magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, and a bunch of other asinine bullshit.&nbsp; You don&#039;t live here so you don&#039;t see the crap he&#039;s pulled in the last 4 years, there must be more idiots in my country than I thought to vote the worthless excuse for a human being back in.&nbsp; I was dumbfounded the day of the election.&nbsp; To sum it up, he is an enemy of the Constitution and should be treated as such.&nbsp; Our rights to bear arms do NOT come from the government, our rights come endowed to us from the Creator.&nbsp; They should stay the hell out of it, they have no place trying to tell us what we can or cannot do in that respect.&nbsp; The right to bear arms was already understood and practiced by pretty much everyone when this country was taking shape.&nbsp; If he tries to do a gun grab, he&#039;ll have a civil war on his hands.. mark my words.

Fantasizing about mass murder is not normal Seriously.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how in touch with reality you are, fantasizing about things like that. If you&#039;re more afraid of your neighbors having guns than you are of only the government having guns while the citizens are disarmed, you are out of touch with reality and have no understanding of history.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Depends how serious you are with the &#039;fantasy&#039;.&nbsp; Everyone has a moment where the feel they could just flip out and the idea of having an instant death machine (gun whatever :P) at hand increases the likelihood of you doing something regrettable.
