				i was just thinking about part of the evidence that they said led them to dpr. those passports with his pictures on them, from canada. well the fbi could have easily made those passports up themselves, or even ordered them using dpr&#039;s pic, then intercepted them as they would have known they were going to his address because it was them that sent them.<br /><br />so i really can&#039;t see that evidence itself standing up to much in court.<br /><br />yeah bitch, plausible deniability

				They have private messages that DPR was going to get the ID&#039;s and then he ordered them from a SR vendor. They have a site image. <br /><br />Done.

				While I disagree with the OP&#039;s comment about the FBI making up those ID documents, I agree with the title of this thread about plausible deniability. There is plausible deniability allover this case given the TOR aspect of it, and several other factors (the forbes article, change of writing style, the Princess Bridge (lol?), the roomates, the &quot;multiple DPR&quot; theories.. etc etc etc.).<br /><br />Here&#039;s a post I made on BMR forum regarding Ulbrights possible defense strategies and several areas of plausible deniability:<br />http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewtopic.php?pid=51899#p51899<br />

				i&#039;m not saying that they absolutely did, just that the possibility is easily there that they could have. that creates reasonable doubt in a courtroom.

				I understand what you meant.. but I&#039;m saying that the feds are not going to risk getting such a high profile case potentially mistrial-ed or lost because it comes out that they concocted false evidence.. you know?

				I&#039;m sorry but if you think DPR can get out of this then you haven&#039;t read enough of the FBI affidavit. They already have a very solid case and a lot of the evidence fits. The only way DPR can get off the hook is to find someone in almost the exact same circumstances and pin it on him. Otherwise forget it. I really hate saying this shit. I just don&#039;t see a way out. Not at this point.

				Baraka, I posted a thread on the BMR forum titled:<br /><br />&quot;What do you think Ulbright&#039;s defense strategy will be&quot;<br /><br />Here is the text of that post:<br /><br />aven&#039;t seen much discussion on this, since I assume we&#039;re all still recovering from the shock.<br /><br />So, what do you all think will be Ross Ulbright&#039;s defense? I read in one of the articles that he claims to be broke and needed a public defender.. could this be the beginning of one of the following strategies:<br /><br />1) I am not DPR. I am not this person you&#039;re claiming I am, and YOU have the burden of proving that I am the person known as Dread Pirate Roberts aka Silk Road. Prove it. Prove it irrefutably. Not that I was the first person to post about SR on bitcointalk as &quot;altoid&quot;. No, that&#039;s just because I genuinely stumbled upon it and wanted to promote it. Not because I asked a question about hidden services on StackExchange and then changed my name to frosty.. no.. that&#039;s just because I wanted the answer to that question.<br /><br />2) DPR is many people, and while yes, I was &quot;one of them&quot; (as you know because you put me in the same cafe logging into my Ross Ulbright gmail address while someone else was also inside of that cafe accessing the VPN directly into SR&#039;s admin portal), but it could have been the guy sitting to the left of me. Or that I was given access to this VPN by one of the other &quot;DPRs&quot;<br /><br />3)I&#039;m not DPR, but my roomate/someone else is. (and I&#039;ll testify to that).<br /><br />4) I am not the original DPR. The old DPR handed over the website to me after he set it up, after those murder-for-hire schemes, and while yes, I operated Silk Road for a few months.. I&#039;m not the mastermind who had it running since the beginning.. and I swear I felt so bad about it that I was going to turn myself in. So instead of life in prison, can I only have like .. 5 or 6 months?<br /><br />5)I am DPR. I am the guy, it was always me, you got me, but I&#039;ll hand over a shit ton of vendors whom I know who they are and effectively be a rat, so lets make a deal for my freedom<br /><br />6)I am DPR. I am the guy, it was always me, you got me, but I WILL NOT hand over a shit ton of vendors whom I know who they are and effectively be a rat, therefore, throw everything you got at me. I believed in my &quot;cause&quot;. I believed in what I was doing. Nobody REALLY technically got assasinated, so I&#039;m not a killer. Hell, I knew that the first &quot;hit&quot; was just a plain scam, and the 2nd was me just fucking with the &quot;hitman&quot; whom I figured was a fed.<br /><br />What do you guys think? While obviously there&#039;s humor in these strategies.. the underlying theme is proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Ross Ulbright IS the SOLE DPR from day1 till Oct 2nd, and assuming that the possibility of a plea bargain in exchange for cooperation (by giving up vendors or whatever) is something the federal government might offer.<br /><br />Considering the fact that TOR is involved, and I see nothing in the affidavits (both the main one and the hitman shit in Maryland)<br />that talk about linking him to being DPR in regards through TOR.. and considering that he HIMSELF wasn&#039;t actually selling drugs, but he probably knows a few guys who DO (and the government would love that information).. it seems this is not just a black and white case.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />

				Remember other then 70+ pages of charges, there is much information that is not made public or include in those papers. They work on this case for a LONG time. They have angles covered before they act.
