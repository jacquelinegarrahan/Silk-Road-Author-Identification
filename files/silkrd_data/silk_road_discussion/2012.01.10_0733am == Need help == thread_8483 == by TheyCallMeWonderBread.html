				Hey whats up i&#039;m new to SR I just joined yesterday and I love this website it&#039;s incredible what you can do here I love it and hope to be a happy member of SR :D<br /><br />But I wanted to know a few things.<br />First off where the hell do I buy bit coins for a good price? They&#039;re so expensive!<br />Also i&#039;m new to drugs and getting high so what should I try for my first time?<br />Anddd how do you mine for Bitcoins? I&#039;ve tried but I get an incredibly low amount like 0.0000000385 every 1hour ._.<br /><br />How would you buy things from people on here anyway? If I bought drugs could they be traced to my address? I understand that the credits are encrypted and everything but it&#039;s the address the person ships it to that scares me.<br /><br />Also do most people ship drugs and stuff incognito?

				You can&#039;t get bitcoins for a good price. They&#039;re always too expensive.

Hopefully you are not trolling and your just clueless about SR.<br />Bit coins - Try mt.gox first. Alternatively, the simplest way would be CampBx but it&#039;s pretty expensive. <br />Drugs are usually hidden pretty well, but be careful. Don&#039;t let your mom find your DMT and take it away like mine did.<br />As for what drugs you do, that&#039;s a personal choice, but be careful, young people like us should cherish our innocence.

				Don&#039;t worry about the price of bitcoins, goods on SR will change price with the value of bitcoin. That said, you&#039;ll have to go to an exchange if you don&#039;t want to pay large fees. Don&#039;t bother with mining them unless you have a high-end ATI graphics card in your computer, anything else is a waste of time and money.<br /><br />Have you not done any drugs before? Little strange that you&#039;d arrive here without any experience, I&#039;d say weed would be a good place to start. Probably the hardest thing to get in the post though, maybe a bit of hash would be better (and cheaper).<br /><br />Of course if the package is intercepted it will be traced to your address, it&#039;s got your address written on it. You&#039;re gonna have to deal with this risk, or find another place to receive parcels (friend&#039;s house - if they agree, doubt you&#039;ll be able to open a PO box without ID but maybe you&#039;ll think of something). As long as drug laws aren&#039;t too bad in your country you won&#039;t be in too much trouble for personal use, especially as a minor, your parents are gonna kick your ass though. Don&#039;t use a fake name either, it makes the package more suspicious. Deny all knowledge of any parcel if something does go wrong.

				Step #1 - READ THE FORUMS/WIKI. I hate to be that troll but honestly its for your own safety. <br />With that said I&#039;ll briefly answer your questions<br />1.)Getting coins:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.)Use one of the trusted vendors on the board like SugarMama - you will be buying a MoneyPak reload card from CVS/Walgreens/Walmart etc. and exchanging that for coins<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.)Use a company like get-bitcoin to purchase coins with bank deposit/wire/etc.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.)Use a trusted exchange site to purchase coins through a series of hoops ala dwolla<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Btc-e/campbx/tradehill/mtgox/<br />2.)Where to start your career as a drug user<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.)Pot; where else. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.)Mom and Dads medicine cabinet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.)LSD/Mushrooms - much like using heroin, there really is no reason to worry about learning to swim before jumping in the deep end.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C-1.)Look into Option B.) for something like xanax or similar pill to bring you back when you inevitably lose it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, buy some here.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.)Cocaine-Research Rick James&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />3.)Mining for coins<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point its a waste, however since your not paying for electricity maybe its worth joining a mining pool<br />4.)How do you make a purchase - bitcoins <br />5.)Shipping risks - there is always the risk that someone will find out, in which case one of two situations usually occurs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.)Letter - when small amounts are seized, often you, the recipient will get a letter stating mailing contraband is illegal and its left at that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.)You don&#039;t want me to describe the alternative<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-1.)If your a minor, maybe they wont try you as an adult.<br />6.)Shipping practices - Its in everyones best interest to be discrete with packages and shipping. Most vendors make every attempt to make their packages blend in.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.)Standard practices - most use Printed labels, correct postage, VALID addresses, flat rate mail via USPS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.)Drug specific practices - If it has a detectable odor like weed, it should be vacuum sealed at least 2x etc<br /><br />hope that clears some of it up for you, <br />I highly recommend going to erowid.org and becoming familiar the drugs your interested in, they have compiled a comprehensive list of effects,durations,dosages and experience reports<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				PumpkinYeti seems like my kind of fella<br /><br /><br />but seriously kid, read the wiki if you want to do business here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m gonna assume you&#039;re at least in high school. Go out and make some friends so you have people to do drugs with.

				I wanted to resist saying this for the fear of sounding like a stick in the mud, but you should wait until you&#039;re eighteen before you start regularly using drugs OP. There are studies floating around, of mixed credibility, that suggest that using drugs regularly when you&#039;re underage can have a lasting effect on your brain. Your brain is still developing, after all. (Before I&#039;m flamed for this, I was warning OP against regular drug use at his age.
