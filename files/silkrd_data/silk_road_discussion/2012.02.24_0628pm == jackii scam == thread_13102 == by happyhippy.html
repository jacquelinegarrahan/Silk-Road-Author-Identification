				Hi Pll , just letting you all know that I just got this PM from jackii <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">re:order 2 grams auto ak<br /><br /><br />Finalizing early but shipment came to me devastated with 90% empty content!!! You use a very dangerous method of packing(the second order for you where was a hole!)! I will have a problems if the post office became aware that they go to my address illegal shipment!!! I was unblocking your escrow before getting the shipment, but in this situation demands immediate refund(at least 70% of 8.00 BTC! ), otherwise I will have to update my feedback(negative).<br /><br />Regard<br /><br />P.S at this moment i gave you: ,,Leave feedback here.&#039;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I went through all my orders past and present , no orders from jackii at all . Now , I&#039;m getting used to buyer scams but to try it on without even placing an order is a new level of taking the piss so I thought I&#039;d put this here as a heads up .

				Tbh, doesn&#039;t even sound like they&#039;re from the UK. I know I&#039;m not the most strict adherent to the rules of grammar, but that message is just terrible! Bullshit as well, because I&#039;ve ordered off you before and the packaging was fine. Still, at least if they never ordered they can&#039;t leave bad feedback!<br />Hopefully after a while the scammers will realise it&#039;s futile and stop. You sellers do an excellent job, and it sucks that people try and screw you over like that.

Unfortunatly there will always be scammers both vendors and sellers but thats the price we have to pay to remain anonymous . Have a great weekend .
