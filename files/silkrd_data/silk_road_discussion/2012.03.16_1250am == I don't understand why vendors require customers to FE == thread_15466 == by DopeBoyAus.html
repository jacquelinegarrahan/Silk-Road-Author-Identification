				Alright so think of it like this - I&#039;m guessing vendors are doing this so that if the product doesn&#039;t arrive to the designated country (or the customer SAYS it didn&#039;t)&nbsp; due to customs or simply a lost letter, they don&#039;t have to deal with the consequences of a resolution center and subsequently either giving a partial/full refund or recieveing negative feedback. However if someone finalizes early, yet doesn&#039;t recieve their package (or claims they didn&#039;t) and goes to the vendor in attempt to sort out some sort of deal/refund and they aren&#039;t satisfied they are still able to edit their feedback and ruin the vendors ratings. There is the same risk of either forking over a partial refund or recieving negative feedback REGARDLESS of FE or escrow. How come no one seems to see this? If anything getting your customer to FE is more damaging because if they do request a refund further down the track they are able to do so without affecting their buyer stats. Infact their stats are improved by adding an extra transaction. Over all escrow is a better system. Period. <br />/rant<br /><br />** Also, I completely understand vendors wanting to reduce the risk of shit scammer buyers and I&#039;m sure most of you have good intentions and are just looking out for yourselves, just UNDERSTAND that making customers FE does not protect you!

				I can only speak for myself but I require FE for one reason; CASH FLOW! if I had to wait for everyone to receive their items before getting paid, I would be out of inventory every couple of days and then have to wait a week or two before I could resupply and that is just not feasible in this business! I tried always staying in escrow at the beginning and it was just not doable!

				That&#039;s understandable. I guess as a vendor who sells exclusively domestic I&#039;m not really faced with the same issue or too the extent you would be anyway. It still frustrates me when I read &quot;must have X amount of transactions for escrow&quot; because they&#039;re justifying it as they are protecting themselves but really they&#039;re at risk of dodgy tactics either way. It&#039;s like the bulk of the people on this site don&#039;t realize they can edit their feedback.

				I fully understand why a Vendor would want some history before allowing a buyer to use escrow. <br /><br />I can also understand the cash flow problem.&nbsp; But, for those with the cash flow problems, what are you doing with your profits?&nbsp; Are you putting a percentage back into your business so you won&#039;t have to use FE in the future?&nbsp; I mean, there are Vendors that have been on here for a considerable amount of time with a very large amount of sales that still require FE in many cases.&nbsp; Such as overseas shipments, or even just out of country shipments.&nbsp; Seems like preventing cash flow problems in the future should be one of your primary goals.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I am a vendor now for more than 5 month with 100% satisfied customer with more than 80 transactions and even more than 100 shipments.<br />To me new customers have to finalize early.<br />Because of this decision I have NO DOUBT that scammers&nbsp; have been mostly stayed away.<br />I am honest, trustable, reliable and fast and there is no reason why I should not been paid when I ship the order!<br />In Germany it is the only way to buy something on the internet. You always have to pay forwarding your shipment.<br />I do not understand the problems some people seems to have with it.<br /><br />The buyer has to take some risk, too. I am not responsible for seizures from your customs or the postman who takes your order for himself.<br />I have to pay for stamps, envelopes, printing labels, items and so on.<br />I spent the whole day by answering to sometimes ridiculous questions and annoying people.<br /><br />If you are a new customer it is no problem for you to get into business but you have to finalize your order.<br /><br />I am very successful by doing so and as I consider no problems by this way of payment I will keep on doing so!<br /><br />By the way:<br />I absolutely have no comprehension for people which place their order and refuse to finalize then.<br />If you are ordering you agree to all terms. No doubt about that.<br /><br />So if you do not agree to finalize early as a new customer or a returning customer outside germany than pleace do not place your order.<br /><br />Hope I can get some LIGHT into this discussion and this helps you to understand both sides.<br /><br />Greets JD

				mails from me usually takes 8-10 days, but it can be one month easy in some cases. me personally - once I shipped I done with it. realistically I cant provide any guaranties of delivery. I will reship to old customer if it is really lost.<br /><br />I think it good do not allow to buyers to finalize early to new sellers, let say who are here for 30-40 days or do not have proved transaction at least 10-20. that will protect buyers from doing stupid things and loosing money. Also it will make SR less attractive for scammers.l

				&nbsp;There should be an addition to our services on SR. Maybe if a vendor has 100+ transactions and 95+ vendor rating we can some how get upto half of our money right away leaving the rest in escrow until the product arrives. that way if you have 3000 in escrow you would already have 1500 for reupping and would wait on the rest until customers got their package.<br /><br />my 2 cents

				What most people don&#039;t understand is that we(venders) don&#039;t get paid until the buyer finalizes the transaction. Some new buyers either don&#039;t know to do this or simply forget.<br /><br />Finalizing early makes it so neither of those are issues and we get paid so that we can keep stock at an appropriate level.<br /><br />It&#039;s very tough having $1000s of product out in the mail system with no money in hand to replace said stock with.

				if a vendor can&#039;t bankroll their own inventory, and require FE from customers to restock, then they really aren&#039;t a serious vendor IMO.<br /><br />There are the one-off vendors who do this for fun/service to others (my favorite kind), and there are the pros with cash and stock.&nbsp; Both, have no real need for anyone to FE. <br /><br />The vendors inbetween just don&#039;t have their shit together and are trying to force buyers into taking on more risk than they should

The vendor is in total control about how the situation will go, which has the advantage when dealing with &quot;your product was absolutely shit&quot; when you know it wasn&#039;t or &quot;I didnt get my product&quot; when you know they did. <br /><br />You already have your money its up to the vendor to decide, if the transaction goes bad, how to handle it. <br />

				I don&#039;t understand why buyers think vendors should only work escrow. There is maybe 350 vendors here and maybe 25000 buyers. So there is WAY more scam buyers then sellers. I could see it being ok to work in escrow if buyers had to buy their buyers account just like vendors. It&#039;s not fair that the vendor should have to put all the trust in buyers but the sellers not in vendors. I think people who complain about only escrow and don&#039;t even have many buys need to prove them selves with good buyers stats to deserve working in escrow

				Escrow can be abused - but I think traders have stats so know if a customer is just some scam artist who set up an account to milk a few freebies.<br /><br />Like any business it usually works on customer loyalty but with the added bonus of having choice on whatever it is you want to have. As long as traders are honest and deal only in quality then they will build up a good following. <br /><br />The risk here is post not coming. In the UK the postal service is VERY good and 99% of stuff gets through without being stolen in house. Post from Europe is more risky but the vast majority makes it. Out of interest I would like to hear from UK traders about stats regarding claims of lost in the domestic post - or Dutch traders. <br /><br />I think its amazing some traders will resend. I think a &#039;love letter&#039; of seizure would secure 50% of the value back if it was a big order.&nbsp; Some traders with loyal customers who make ten purchases then lose one - usually get a resend. People who come on - make one purchase - and kick up a storm ought to go to street corner in some not so nice neighbourhood and tell one of the corner boys about wanting more gear as you lost some walking home. Or complain about weight or quality maybe. <br /><br />Everyone finalises the deal early buying off the street. Even though we all know its overpriced and usually garbage.<br /><br />If I was asked to finalise early by those I have bought off I would be ok with it. But I have never been asked to finalise early and have waited until the arrival then done the right and FE ASAP! <br /><br />That&#039;s my view of it.<br /><br />If you FE and lose some big parcel and have a good business relationship I am sure most here are looked after.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the real world you sometimes send someone to buy something. If they lose it its just tough. If the cops grab it then its tough. If you get home and its concrete and not &#039;da bomb heroin&#039; its tougher still. No chance to rate anyone, no escrow. Silk Road treats us like human beings not just someone to rip off. The system here is a work in progress and better than any other system. In real life we all pay before we actually even get to see if its real.<br /><br />Here we do the same we send a postal worker or series of them to do the running. The trader is out of pocket as soon as he or she posts it. I&#039;d reckon for losing maybe one in 50 parcels in the UK. The postie and the usual snake in the grass who robs in your home! Kids, Wife - anyone opening the parcel many of which are not in the real name.<br /><br />Escrow is a good idea IMO. FE goes from case to case. If I was selling I would like the option of insisting on FE in some cases and depending on my cash flow. After all - it may take 24 hr or more from getting the BTC to actually getting hold of real money. Then it might take 24 hr to get more stock.

				Hold on while I put on my best grandpa voice here... ackhem:<br /><br />I&#039;m myyyyyy day, there was no such thing as escrow! We just looked on whatever review forum hadn&#039;t been shut down yet this week, sent our western union / greendot, and prayed! And anybody could post on those forums, no system in place to make sure only feedback came from people who legitimately had purchased something.&nbsp; You&#039;d have great deals with someone and then one day they&#039;d just disappear with your money.&nbsp; All we ever heard was, &quot;so and so&#039;s a shill,&quot; &quot;so and so is a scammer,&quot; &quot;so and so is a reverse scammer!&quot; and all too frequently, &quot;so and so is a pedophile!!!&quot; For no goddamned reason besides trolls being trolls.&nbsp; And we had to walk uphill to school 5 miles in the snow, goddammit.<br /><br />In all seriousness, though, as someone who&#039;s new to Silk Road but has been purchasing drugs online since pre-webtryp (admittedly on an on-and-off basis - mostly off in more recent years) - I love the idea of escrow and I think it&#039;s a pretty brilliant system, but I absolutely get why sellers would have a problem with it and I especially get why they would demand early finalization from new buyers.&nbsp; To me it seems like escrow&#039;s a privilege for trusted buyers.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to FE for as many transactions as it takes for me to earn a good rep here.&nbsp; I&#039;m just giddy as hell that there&#039;s this shiny new awesome place with legitimate systems in place that make it a LOT less of a gamble than what I&#039;m used to.

				I know there is some serious work being done in the background to give trusted sellers (and proper trusted sellers, not 1 month noobs that have sold a pill bottle of Xanax) early access to Escrow funds.&nbsp; I&#039;m led to believe that this will incur a fee to the seller to do this, which in Economics 101, will just be passed on to the customer.<br /><br />What I suggest would be a better idea is to loan part of the escrow pool out to vendors and charge them a daily interest rate.&nbsp; The loan amount can be either paid back via a BTC deposit or via new sales.&nbsp; This would do away with the requirement to finalize early due to cash flow issues (which I personally find bogus) If the escrow pool isn&#039;t paid back when the loan is due, the amount can be deducted from the sellers account.<br /><br />Just a thought.

				escrow, as it is now OK for small orders, but cannot facilitate bulk trade, I bet most bulk deals go FE. if system suits people well, why they will opt not using it. Guarantee of payment is more important in bulk trade, at present there is no guarantee of payment for seller, I can send 1 kg to someone and what I get for it - resolution, thanks! in clearnet export there is such guarantee, it called BILL OF EXCHANGE. If I don&#039;t want to wait for payment I can sell BILL OF EXCHANGE&nbsp; to some one. <br /><br />my point is that if people go to FE that some how reflect the fact that escrow system in present form do not adequate. it works no doubts, but more financial instruments and development may be needed.

I realize I have only just started on SR but even when I am permitted to finalize early I think I will just stay within the escrow system apart from people with under 5 successful previous purchases. It just seems a lot fairer on everyone really and has all the security. I think the only thing I would insist on cash upfront are things I didn&#039;t have on my listings but can get on request because I wouldn&#039;t budget for those sorts of products or maybe things that are made-to-order. <br /><br />I think this approach is fair on everyone. <br /><br />
