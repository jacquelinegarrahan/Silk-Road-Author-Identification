				Could some one help me out please. Im trying to set up a hidden service and have looked at the information on Tor website and have also seen some services offering to host the site for you. Wondering if anyone knows a reliable hidden service provider that would host my content for me?

				You wouldhave to host it yourself and not tell anyone, for it to be a hidden service. If not your host would know where its at. That kinda kills the idea of a &quot;hidden service&quot;.

Can anyone comment on their services? I heard you need a referral though, which you can at BMR and maybe here as well.

				Sorry to say global1, but operating a hidden service requires technological knowledge. From what you&#039;ve posted, you would have to be crazy if you believe you would be capable of running such a site. Even if it was hosted by a third party, you still require a degree of expertise at the bare minimum if you plan on avoiding contact by LE or Hackers. It&#039;s much more complex than you think to do it successfully, safely and most importantly, anonymously. Just being honest.

From what I have learned freedom hosting is a good option and an invite can be purchased. So then it would just be the design of the site and how to securely and safely connect to it for website updates etc?<br /><br />Are there any services which could design the site for me initially then? Ive seen a few ads on BMR advertising virtually something similar.<br /><br />Can somebody help me out? I can pay if you are the right person for me.

				Really global1, if your Hidden Service is hosted by a third party, how hidden do you think it will really be? Your asking for trouble if you intend to follow through with your idea IMO. A better option for you would be to take the time to educate yourself on how to build and run a hidden service securely and anonymously. This will take you some time but will at least leave you with an understanding of how it&#039;s done. To rush this and potentially jeopardize your freedom if caught rather than take a more methodical approach, dotting your I&#039;s and crossing your T&#039;s is crazy. One thing to remember, relying on &quot;third parties&quot; to build, run, update and maintain your site is not a smart thing to do when your operating a hidden service on the hidden web where your sites anonymity is paramount.

Yes you are right. Do you have any links which actually do tell you an a-z guide of how to set it up, configure the sever and build the website so it is 100% secure and anonymous?

				Start at the Tor website and go from there. You could do a search using DuckDuckGo, startpage or alike or one member that comes to mind who may have or tell you where to find this info is kmfkewm. Send him a PM and see what happens.&nbsp; :)
