				Same thing happened with mine. The site&#039;s compromised and there&#039;s no ther way to put it. DPR isn&#039;t posting like DPR, the &quot;Support&quot; is non-existent and people are getting robbed, meanwhile major buyers and vendors are doing business. God I hope I&#039;m wrong but there&#039;s so many incosistencies it&#039;s not funny. I&#039;ve been a buyer for a long time since the start and it&#039;s those like us that can tell the difference (aside from the obvious) and until I get reimbursed what I&#039;m owed I can&#039;t bring myself to put more money into a site that&#039;s ripped me so far for 150 BTC&#039;s. DOn&#039;t get me wrong they might sort it out but 20hrs after getting all the info they shouldn&#039;t have already needed? WTF???<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72929.msg595683#msg595683">Quote from: exgo on November 16, 2012, 03:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i watch chain all the time,, this is newnshit... inhave never seennthis shit... ballance zero,,unconfirmed transactions,,,<br /><br />somethingnis weird with SR.. ifnthis fucks up it will be as sketchy as finalizing early with a seller on SR... but u know.. all sellers seem to go bad eventially....ninjustndidn&#039;t group SR in the same league.. but afternthis,,,,<br /><br />i don&#039;t know<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Can you explain this in better detail? How are you tracing your 9.2 bitcoins?<br /><br />To be honest, I can barely read your original message.<br /><br />I have sympathy with you though, as the 32 bitcoins I sent are missing as well. I can track it with the block explorer though and they appear to be sitting on the address I sent it to. I don&#039;t think SR is compromised, but I am just a tad nervous that I won&#039;t see my money. You guys are freaking out, be calm. There&#039;s no reason to believe that SR has been compromised other than anecdotal evidence.

				Go to blockchain.info then type in your BTC address, and you will be able to see records of every transaction and deposit that&#039;s gone in or out of it and to what BTC address they were sent. IF they are sent by your bTC wallet to your SR wallet that&#039;s all it should show. Other peoples like myself and others show withdrawals, even weird deposits and then more withdrawals all coming from our wallets that were supposedly secure in the SR severs!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72929.msg595740#msg595740">Quote from: mojomo on November 16, 2012, 03:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can you explain this in better detail?

				<br />I can confirm as well that just until now, there&#039;s no longer a balance in my SR bitcoin address.. it shows as spent as well.. I really hope they are transferring it over and probably going to relay it back to us?? PLEASE DPR.. this is getting way too stressing.. first the site being down and now just an unlucky few of us who are still in suspense..

				I checked the block explorer and I see the transaction, all 32 bitcoins to the address I sent<br /><br />But...<br /><br />I sent 32 bitcoins flat to the address. Why is it saying that there&#039;s 0.0995 coming from my wallet into the same address even though I actually had that before I sent it? It splits the transaction into 3, one with 4, one with 10, and one with 18.0995. It doesn&#039;t seem to add up.

				Maybe it&#039;s the feds trying to get us to post addresses publicly? Lol I think that&#039;s far fetched, but I still ain&#039;t got no money and it&#039;s beginning to tick me off. Plus I don&#039;t even have 5 btcs to send to this address, and i&#039;m reluctant to change it cause then sr support will have a tougher time actually finding the address.

				<br />SAME THIng happening to me right now.. do you think Support team is behind this? Maybe they&#039;re relaying it to one of their address and then will send it right back so their actual system will actually update our balance on the main system?<br /><br />I hope we&#039;re not getting robbed.. i thought SR owned the access rights to these bitcoin addresses..

				could you people explain the problems in more detail?<br /><br />If SR works as it should, the account balance of your SR wallet will always show 0, because SR sends them to other addresses immediately after arrival, but you probably know this.<br />So what exactly is the problem?

I sent the bitcoins like 7 hours ago, and they&#039;re still not credited in my account. I checked the block explorer, and it&#039;s there. Just kinda sitting there, my 32 beloved bitcoins. It&#039;ll probably be there soon, just it was a bit of a shock seeing as it has always deposited fast in the past.<br /><br />The account balance of my sr wallet still shows as 32 bitcoins full, so I guess they haven&#039;t tumbled it yet. I&#039;m impatient, but others genuinely seem to have problems, so I thought I&#039;d hop in and share what was going on.
