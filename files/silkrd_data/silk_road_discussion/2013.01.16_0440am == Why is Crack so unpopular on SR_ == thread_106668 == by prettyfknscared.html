				It&#039;s really more how the product is consumed ( small hits, many times a day ) that makes it unpopular on the internet.<br /><br />Net is great for things like marijuana, MDMA, RC&#039;s, cocaine in powder form, pharms .. things like that since it opens markets and breaks borders in some cases ... but crack and H will always reside mainly hand to hand offline IMO

				Well cocaine is crack so if you&#039;re using cocaine you;re a bum lowlife and deserve a bullet in your head and someone shoul;d piss on your mothers grave. Anyways there&#039;s not so much cocaine freebase in my opinion because people intelligent enough to get on silkroad if they want (and alot of them do)&nbsp; will cook freebase from cocaine they bought. There&#039;s definetely people who smoke cocaine recreationally and Whitney houston is just stupid-American-bitch-celebrity.

				This is a funny subject. Guess what is made first from Coca Leaf? Base! Now Crack is called crack because of the NaHCO3 still in it causing it to pop and shit. Personally have made my share of Coca Paste (85-90%) from imported Coca powder from Peru, but as has been said already, with Base you can&#039;t stop until its gone...Base just doesn&#039;t give you what say something like DMT gives you for such a short acting drug. Personally prefer chewing Coca Leaves myself ;-)

				Crack is pretty easy to cook from cocaine so I would assume that most of the buyers on here that are into crack can just purchase from one of the cocaine vendors and cook it themselves....otherwise they would just buy it on the streets where you can purchase it in small amounts such as $5 vials.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have to many friends that are into crack but the ones who are usually just purchase it in large amounts and spend a night smoking it all then forget about it because it&#039;s not really their main DOC.

				I would say, and this is just my opinion (so take it with a grain of salt), that The Road has vendors that sell just about everything. If I was inclined to buy crack or cocaine, I would probably just buy the pure coke, just because.

				From what I&#039;ve read, you can&#039;t just do crack and then, after being sober for the week it takes to order and ship, still convinced that smoking more is a good idea. This site seems to be just be full of responsible users that are able to use drugs in a sustainable way, and responsible use pretty much just isn&#039;t viable with crack.&nbsp;

				Because you&#039;re halving your market - at least that&#039;s how I see it. You sell cocaine you&#039;re going to attract 2 types of buyer; people who want cocaine and people that want crack. It&#039;s not difficult to cook crack from cocaine and it&#039;s something any user would be able to do themselves. You cook all of your stash into crack then you&#039;ve immediately distanced yourself from potential customers who just want cocaine.

				Shipping and fiend are diametrically opposed actions when it comes to crack.<br /><br />That sh!t destroys people, families, communities.<br /><br />Plus, you can buy coke for the even super inflated prices of The Road, cook it up, rock it, and double up.<br /><br />It&#039;s a no brainer.

				As a former user I would say first. Crack is wack. It is a now now now drug. Waiting for that pack to arrive seems impossible. I would sooner steal some shit and hit the dope track. I hate that shit with all the life in my body. It took years to undo the shit it caused my life and buried many good people i knew. So glad i got help in NA. I would be dead without it. Although I use psychedelics again I cannot stress enough how much I love the 12 steps for shit i need to solve in my life. Sound strange? yes but that is my experience.

				Anyone know the difference between crack and free base?&nbsp; They are different to be sure.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure some people that get righteous powder have tried cookin a little.&nbsp; Crack is sort of a rip off in a way.&nbsp; What are grams now? 50$usd?&nbsp; How long will that last?&nbsp; Then what? You want more, then you do more, then you want more, then you do more, then you want more, then you do more.&nbsp; Ridiculous.&nbsp; A gram of real good blow last alot longer, much cleaner high, hardly any comedown.&nbsp; Any knowledgeable people wanna tell how real crack is made?&nbsp;
