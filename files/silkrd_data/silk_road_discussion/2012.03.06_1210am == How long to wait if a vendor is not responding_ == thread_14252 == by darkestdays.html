				I am interested in purchasing a driver&#039;s license from a vendor on silk road. I messaged him about a recent change in the license&#039;s appearance 2 days ago, and received no response. I messaged him again last night asking about this and received no response. I know that he has read both messages, and I realize that vendors are busy people.<br /><br />So my question is, how long should I wait before asking him again? I don&#039;t want to nag but I&#039;m eager to make this purchase.

				Generally best to play it by ear. Also keep in mind that vendors keep different schedules - if you messaged the vendor two days ago, that would be Saturday night to some vendors, many of whom may not work on Sundays. If the vendor appears reputable and has good rankings you can usually trust that they&#039;ll respond in due time; I&#039;d say just be patient:)<br /><br />Hope that helps!

				You can tell if the vendor has opened your msg or not because it will remain bold in your sent box until they open it (i&#039;ve found this helpful in determining if I was being avoided or not because nobody likes me :D).<br /><br />Their seller profile will also say the last time they&#039;ve logged on, so if it say&#039;s like 3 day&#039;s for him then he obviously hasn&#039;t responded to you cuz he hasn&#039;t been online.&nbsp; Not to mention the seller&#039;s profile page is the best way to determine the status of the vendor.&nbsp; Real life (bad things) happens too, and that&#039;s where they&#039;ll update.&nbsp; There&#039;s a XX page thread about &quot;Where did PV go&quot; that if 3/4 of the people in that thread had read their profile would have known they had to &#039;suspend&#039; operations cuz of RL shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />
