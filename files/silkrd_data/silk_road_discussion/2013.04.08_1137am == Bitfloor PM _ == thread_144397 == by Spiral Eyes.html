				Post by: <strong>Spiral Eyes</strong> on <strong>April 08, 2013, 11:37 am</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				I woke up to a PM from Bitfloor with info about their services and what not. Now, I&#039;m fairly new around here... is it typical for a trading exchange to have a presence on a drug market forum? I&#039;m just curious, with all the scam accounts and fake forum accounts etc etc, that this might not actually be BITFLOOR contacting me. I mean, it looks legit, got his logo and all that, and it&#039;s not like he&#039;s asking me to send him coins to his address or something. I guess I just didn&#039;t think a company like that would want to associate with this site directly. Either way, I was informed of some upcoming changes to Bitfloor, where you&#039;ll be able to make your BOA deposit and coins will be sent directly to your wallet. He says they use the MTGOX average to value the BTC. I&#039;m not sure how that all works, but it seems like Bitfloor sells at a fair amount higher than Gox. Regardless, the only way for me to fund gox is through Bitinstant, and I&#039;ll cut my own dick off before I do that again. Anyone else get a Pm from Bitfloor?

				Sounds like a scam. Can you post what they sent you exactly?

Can you post what they sent you exactly?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;Hi there!<br /><br />Saw your post on the forum. We have a pretty straightforward system in place on our website. Very fast, and you get your coins within 30 minutes. We take our BTC value from MTGOX.<br />We are going to be doing a few specials this week - selling BTC at below market pricing depending on volume and up to our discretion as an incentive for new clients/customers. If you don&#039;t see the option for a discounted BTC on our website, then shoot me a PM here and we will hook you up. It&#039;s a very straightforward process. You tell us how much USD$ worth of BTC you want to purchase, and we give you our Bitfloor account # (Bank of America) with an EXACT deposit amount. It must be exact because that will be your unique identifier. You can either have it sent to your Bitfloor account, or we will be rolling out a new feature to have the coins sent directly to any wallet address you provide. Usually by the time you&#039;re back home from the Bank your coins will be in your wallet! It&#039;s that easy.<br /><br />For example, you want to purchase $150 in BTC. You will be given deposit instructions with our BOA Account Name, Number, and $152.34 (made up number). Usually we go by the MTGox average, but we will hook you up with a below market rate if you&#039;re new.<br /><br />Good luck and let me know how I can serve you.<br /><br />Cheers!&quot;<br /><br /><br />I mean, Bitfloor, if this is really your account, then thank you for the heads up and I&#039;d love a discount . It&#039;s just hard to trust people around here, and I have to question the legitimacy of a drug forum account baring the name of an exchange service. I mean, Bitfloor directly tied to Silk Road, seems...um... how do I say this..? Ya, stupid.

				Yeah I was gonna post this yesterday but I forgot. Someone registered a forum account claiming to be from Bitfloor. I asked them if they could verify their identity and they said they would get right on it. Haven&#039;t seen another post yet.

It appears, so far at least, that they are just providing valid information and customer support. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose. I think everyone should be aware of this account and the fact that it could be anybody, though. If/when it is confirmed to actually be a Bitfloor representative, it will be great to have that presence on the forums. Until then, proceed with caution and make sure the information you are being provided is accurate.

				Ya, the only thing I saw as possibly concerning is letting him know if a discount didn&#039;t work. Seems like he would have to send me some &quot;code&quot; to initiate a discount, and I suppose that could be something.. But ya, BST is a good point. I forgot about that. So, Bitfloor, accept my apology please if it is indeed you. I&#039;m sure you understand that it pays to be cautious around here. I was on Bitfloor and didn&#039;t notice anything about discounted prices. Tho, it was cheaper than gox today.

				Okay i use bitfloor and have used it for sometime now.<br />Usually after i make the deposit at BOA my money is online within 30min<br />today i deposited a larger than usual amount and the money still has not arrived.<br />I emailed both Localtill support and bitfloor support and no response. The only thing i can think of is that<br />i made the deposit extremely late in the day it was at literally 3:59 and the bank closes at 4 so<br />is it possible the money was sent but never received because the receiving party was closed for the day?<br />I not then where the heck is my money?! ive never had a problem like this before, i am extremely nervous my <br />money is not where i want it. Am i over-reacting or should i in fact be concerned?! <br /><br />Has anyone else tried to make a deposit today?

Happened to me 4 days ago too. Bitfloor is certainly losing in my book... or I just have awful timing.
