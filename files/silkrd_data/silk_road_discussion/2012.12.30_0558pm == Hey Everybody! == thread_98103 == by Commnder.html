				Hey guys, I just found out about Silk Road and the whole process is very confusing, and hard to learn about. So I have two main questions: How exactly do I encrypt my shipping information when I make orders? I do not have a bank account, bu I have access to prepaid cards, moneypak, etc. That being said, what is the easiest way to get BitCoins added to my Silk Road address?<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to give me a full blown description, though that would be appreciated, if you could just point me in the direction of some links that&#039;d be great. I&#039;ve read the Wiki, but the Tor Browser is inexplicably slow for my Internet so navigating to pages takes literally like 5 minutes, that&#039;s why I can&#039;t search around for this answers or I&#039;d be at the computer all day.<br /><br />Oh, and what&#039;s up? First post, hoping to get to know some of you, I&#039;m a nice guy, I do lots of programming among other things., and I&#039;m hoping my experience on these forums will be nothing but positive!

				Go into the main Forum section and read the first few Bold postings, alos check out the other forum sections about PGP and Security. Also do searches on the vendors you plan to order from. Go to walmart and buy a MP for over over 100.00 with Cash (very important), then go to main silk road to the Money section and locate SugarMama and purchase one of the free orders for BTC from your MP, send her the number, you will get coins directly into your account, then order from a Trusted Vendor, and if you have followed everything that you researched and read about you will be getting what you ordered. Good Luck and don&#039;t be surprised if you get scolded for not reading before posting

				Thank you very much. I won&#039;t be surprised, I know how forums work: the second you ask a question that&#039;s already answered in a thread, you get everybody&#039;s d*** up your ass. But it&#039;s necessary as it keeps down forum clutter, so shame on me I guess.

				Here is an encryption tutorial by member astor:&nbsp; http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />Standard free advice:&nbsp; Research your vendors carefully, give your real name &amp; address to SR vendors and don&#039;t use FE (finalize early).<br /><br />Good luck and welcome to SR. <br />/wm
