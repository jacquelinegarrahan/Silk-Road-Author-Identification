				For the past 24 hours I have not been able to log on just as everyone else. So I started looking around about 24 hours ago they posted on twitter of all places a link to an address viva64.com/en/b/0178 What they are doing in my opinion is beefing up the security of the system. They are using this PVS-Studio to migrate 32 bit windows applications to 64 bit windows applications. It also goes through and routes out all the errors and bugs. Even this past week I spoke to someone from SR who said they were experiencing several issues with bugs. If anyone can shed some more light about PVS Studio feel free to do so.&nbsp; These guys know what the fuck they are doing, if you think about it they are probably the biggest drug dealers in the world now I do not see SR staying down for long.

				What you&#039;ve said doesn&#039;t make sense. I think you&#039;ve got confused between TOR and SR.<br /><br />PVS studio is a code analyser for C/C++ programs, like the tor software. Silk Road is written in PHP, a web scripting language. The tor developers working on improving and removing security bugs from the tor software wouldn&#039;t cause downtime in silk road. Completely different things.

				If it were the case that they are beefing up security then I believe that&#039;d be a service worth some downtime.&nbsp; What I don&#039;t get, though, is why they wouldn&#039;t be more explicit with us about this.&nbsp; I know they made a post a few days ago but still...

				Why would they need to broadcast that there is going to be downtime? Its not like their a bank and were going to bring our business else where. Especially if they are improving their security that is not something I would want to be broadcasting for everyone to know.

				The exact reason, in my mind, why no one has heard anything/no effort has been made to communicate is because that isn&#039;t something you&#039;d want to broadcast. Throw everybody out, and keep them guessing.<br /><br />

				Yep, I&#039;ve seen many people here bitching about the downtime and acting like SR is responsible for alerting everyone of downtime. Bull Shit. They don&#039;t owe anyone anything. You should be happy that they do what they already do. If you don&#039;t like it, leave. There are alternatives. If not. Sit tight. Relax and stop starting shit with rumors and other stories. Everything will work itself out. Whatever this is about will only make the market stronger. And by &quot;market&quot; I don&#039;t just mean SR.

The amount of BTC that flows through SR is no secret and likely rivals that of some of the smaller exchanges. It has no doubt attracted that attention of a number of blackhats who would like to divert some of those funds. <br /><br />Despite the announcement earlier, I still believe that SR is under the knife of some hack(ers) and are trying to mitigate damages or have themselves identified a security issue and are trying to correct it. <br /><br />DPR and Co. would never intentionally halt service at what must be their busiest time of the week, unless it was halted for them. If this truly was an issue related to&nbsp; overcrowding I would imagine they would have left it run as it has been (slow and clunky), announce a maintenance black out and then take the site down for upgrades. <br /><br />I guess we will all find out Monday

It is in SR&#039;s best interest to keep its customer base happy and aware. How many times does SR need to go black before users migrate to other markets, yes they do exist. I can also guarantee you that others will be springing up in i2p and tor alike. SR holds a monopoly on the service at the moment, but all giants must fall and if SR continues to treat it&#039;s user base as nothing more then BTC then users will migrate to other platforms.

				K going to speculate ... I know from personal experience some of the greatest downtime I experienced was when I physically had to move a server. Thinking maybe DPR is moving on up to the other side of the train tracks or perhaps even farther.

If that kind of build-out is taking place, DPR couldn&#039;t telegraph it because the activity in the physical world and the Internet routing world could tip off LE or at least give clues or leave traces to be followed.<br /><br />I think another slowdown occurred and DPR said enough is enough and pulled the plug to move over to a new setup that had been in the works for some time. Now when you undertake such a thing, coordinating the combination of facility, IP, hardware, software and data ain&#039;t no small thing. Add to that secrecy&#039;s need for minimization of hands on deck, uncharted territories of equipment and controls, and Murphy&#039;s Law (things WILL go wrong), and you have a VERY busy DPR who knows that once everything is back up and running, hopefully smoother than before, he will be a hero again and any rumblings of mutiny will be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />All I have to say to DPR and the mods, admins and other assorted angels is:&nbsp; Go get &#039;em tigers!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />(My post from the other thread)<br /><br />Modzi

				I agree that it&#039;s likely a physical server move. The server appears to be up, but it can&#039;t finish HTTP connections. A packet decode would be helpful. Perhaps the server can&#039;t be accessed remotely because of compromise or a data center outage, and they are resurrecting SR from a backup elsewhere.

				Ah man Ive been shitting myself. At first I wasnt bothered then I started panicking that I would never see it again. Of course I spent ages and ages fretting and stressing before I thought of look round and finding out. I&#039;ll catch up now and just keep hoping they are back in no time.
