				Hello everyone,<br /><br />as i heard from this side i was so exiting and sooo happy to see that people still try to fuck the system. But, looking perfectly the page and checking the drug prices, i went back to reality. The drug prices, especial the opioid (heroin, mophine, codeine, oxycodone) are so fucking expensive. Did anyone know why?<br /><br />cheers,<br />paganini <br />

				as far as i can make out pal, the extra expense is for the delivery straight to ur door, u have less chance of getting busted but its not a guarantee...<br /><br />quality sometimes aswell but not always unfortunately...<br /><br />regards...

				Well, i&#039;m living not so far away from Holland and so can get almost any drug for a good price ... but the most worst prices are for medicinal. the are extremely expensive as e.g. in Mexican pharmacies. i just bought tramadol from another page much cheaper. Maybe i should became a vendor ;) hehe<br /><br />But in any case i don&#039;t understand the ideology of the page. A good use for this marketplace could be if you get heroin directly from Afghanistan or Thailand, hash directly from Morocco, coke from Colombia etc., etc.. In this way we can buy the best quality for a really cheap price ... also can be avoid that all this criminals make a lot of money and cut the drugs until we get a really bad quality.&nbsp;

				You can find pretty good deals on raw and powder forms of various drugs on SR.&nbsp; But, if you are going after prescriptions, especially narcotic drugs, you are going to pay the premium.

				From how it has been told to me: the price a vendor pays per month + the commission on every sale + the costs of stealth = take it up the ass, you cocksucker...in the immortal words of Gordon Gekko!<br /><br />I have, do, and will always call, straight bullsh!t!<br /><br />There&#039;s wholesale and there&#039;s retail...and SR has room for both.

				I&#039;m not sure what OP is smoking.&nbsp; The prices on here are pretty damned good if you know who to hit up.&nbsp; Amazing quality acid for $5/tab?&nbsp; $30/g for MDMA?&nbsp; Uh...yeah good luck finding prices like that domestically.<br /><br />For a lot of drugs though you might be better off at street buying since they&#039;re more reasonably priced.&nbsp; SR is really nice just for the fact you can get top quality products that are hard to come by for fair prices

				Buyers set prices!&nbsp; Something is only worth what a buyer is willing to pay.&nbsp; If the supply is low, the prices go up until there is enough incentive for more selling/production.&nbsp; It is simple economics!

				the price is set by the market my friend.&nbsp; you want cheaper drugs, hook up with some drug dealers.&nbsp; since that isn&#039;t an option for some people, you got to now not only pay for you drugs, but also for the convenience of sitting on your arse and having the drugs come to you.<br /><br />personally i think it&#039;s great that the prices on here are high.&nbsp; can&#039;t wait till i become a vendor.

				Some stuff is WAY overpriced, some are worth it for what you get. Most pills are alright, except the hydrocodone, I have yet to see anyone selling that crap at a decent price, $10+ for a single 10mg lortab? Rape, and a 5mg lortab shouldn&#039;t be more than $2, but I see them for up to $10+ too, even more after shipping The Oxy is ok, not great, but you can get it for $1 a milli, or a less, pretty much average street price. The heroin is ridiculously overpriced, I mean really? $275+ for a single gram? Holy shit. I don&#039;t care what anyone says their shit is not that good. There&#039;s three US dealers who&#039;s prices have me considering trying them versus scoring around here. I understand that dealing with some of these guys is a great experience, fast, professional, and well hidden, but still, it&#039;s a rapefest at prices like that. Coke is almost as bad, but a little better. The weed however, even though I don&#039;t smoke, is definitely on point, much cheaper than the dank around here.<br /><br />But, there are a couple things that make it worth it. One is the anonymity, the other this being a reputation based system, you generally are going to get what you pay for. You order a gram, and get a .80, complain and they will more than likely straighten it, and hook you up, you complain in the ghetto that dude just shorted you a couple points, and you&#039;ll be lucky to make it home, so no one is going to shoot you here. And finally ...convenience. I don&#039;t have to leave my house to get shit delivered to my door. Unless you&#039;re lucky and have the right number for the guys that do work, it can be a real pain get down, running around town, calling this guy, that guy, and their cousins, brother&#039;s friends neighbor, and then tipping everyone in the chain too, urrrghgh hate the hustle some days.

				I agree some drugs are expensive on SR, but I don&#039;t feel there is a need to level them with street prices. Hell, I can get some better deals/same deals with my street connects! I can get E pills for $10 a pill, but here I can get 200mg MDMA capsules for $15 /pill. Considering street E pills mostly don&#039;t contain MDMA, and if it does, it will most likely not be near 200mg. <br /><br />I was even impressed by some of the weed prices. I figured they would be really overpriced. But to my surprise I found some dank weed (I assume) for really cheap (about $10/gram). But hell, I don&#039;t have the need to order weed, and I feel that is the sketchiest thing to order off SR just because of the strong smell.<br /><br />Psychedelics are where SR shines mostly to me. Sure, mushrooms are more expensive than street prices (I can get them for $20/eighth) But those 25i blotters are REALLY cheap in comparison to other drugs.. 25 Hits for $30?? Talk about a deal. Especially with it&#039;s effects relatively close to LSD, which there is a huge shortage and up rise of scammers on SR, not to mention LSD&#039;s price considering how hard it is to make.

				hi guys,<br /><br />thx for all the answers .. first of all I&#039;d like to say that i really love the principle of the side. it is amazing.<br />it is even cool that for some people the prices are better then in the places where they leave ... but for me NEVER. i take since 25 years drugs and used to deal with them for many years and large quantity of it ... so i know the real prices so it will be impossible to buy. but even trough it is really cool here .. so maybe i should refresh my old connection and became a vendor ;)<br /><br />have a nice weekend everyone and take care<br /><br />cheers.

				I&#039;d argue that the reason that drugs are more expensive on SR is that you&#039;re dealing with a customer base that is, very generally, more intelligent and quality-driven than drug users at large. The average SR customer, through their very presence on SR, has shown that they are not getting what they need from the &#039;street drugs&#039; market. They&#039;re looking for specific products at specific quality points, and I think it&#039;s a safe wager that they have an above average level of disposable income.<br /><br />If you&#039;re on SR, it&#039;s because you&#039;re looking for something that you can&#039;t find on the street. There&#039;s no way that someone is going to go through the trouble of figuring out Tor, securing their computer, exchanging fiat into BTC, setting up a secure delivery location and risking their package getting lost in the mail if they can just make a phone call and get it.&nbsp; What they&#039;re looking for might be security, anonymity, quality, control, quantity, selection, or something else entirely. What you are looking for on SR is, essentially, a premium product. And for this, you&#039;re going to pay a premium price.<br /><br />I don&#039;t find SR prices in general to be exorbitant. Some stuff (esp. pharmas) is super-expensive, lots of stuff is reasonably priced, and some stuff (MDMA, for those of us not in NL) is just like crazy freaking cheap. I do find that the quality of drugs on SR is SIGNIFICANTLY better than what&#039;s on the street. It&#039;s not like your local dealer has a message board dedicated to his product, with people offering test results, testimonials, and comparative analysis. You&#039;re getting what your dealer&#039;s got. Period.<br />For someone who actually cares about the quality of the drugs that they&#039;re consuming, SR is a boon. Sure, in my area I can get awesome heroin, but the MDMA here is mediocre, and stuff like DOB, 2C-B, and Mephedrone is just un-gettable. SR puts all of these drugs at your fingertips, along with multiple ways for you to not get arrested along the way. And as was said before, good luck getting your meth dealer to give you a refund when he sells you a bag from bad batch. Good luck getting him to not beat the piss out of you just for asking. Vendors here give refunds and re-ships every single day.<br /><br />For me personally, SR is like a wet dream. It&#039;s a nerdy way to buy a wide variety of high-quality illegal drugs at *mostly* fair prices (I&#039;m looking at you, Adderall) with basically no hassle. What&#039;s not to love? If you&#039;re not willing to spend an extra twenty bucks on that, then you should probably ask your parents to raise your allowance instead of wasting time bitching about it here.<br />

				You&#039;re paying&nbsp; for the ability to work with business men and women who are great at what they do. You&#039;re not just paying for the substance. You&#039;re paying for the service that the vendors provide, as well as the marketplace you use to interact with them through. I believe most vendors offer as competitive prices as they can for the ammount of risk they are taking. I greatly appreciate everyone that plays a part in this site.

				I also think a lot of products are way overpriced, maybe that has to do with me living in the netherlands.<br /><br />Weed prices are pretty insane, but that doesn&#039;t matter since I can just buy it in a coffeeshop if I&#039;d want to. But shipping it seems a real bitch to me because of the intense smell.<br />But LSD and amphetamines.. about 10 euros for 1 hit of lsd, and 1000 euros for 100. That makes no sense at all. 100 hits should be 100 euros.<br />Speed usually is 5 euros a gram. Here it&#039;s 10-20. Then again, I&#039;m not a speed expert so perhaps 1 high quality gram could be 10 euros.<br />Then there is the cocaine. I&#039;m used to 50 euros for 1 gram. Out here it&#039;s a lot more. <br />Some pharmaceuticals.. 10 euros for 1 freaking weak pill!?<br /><br />Basically everything seems very expensive.<br />But, almost everything is here. No need to spend money to go to places and get to know shady/dangerous people who do not sell everything. No refunds, usually they don&#039;t know anything about the quality or they sell you something that&#039;s something totally different and possibly even lethal. So that&#039;s all really positive. And then there are the other things that are said on here.<br /><br />I do wonder about the rate of currency fluctuation. When I read about bitcoins, 10 euros would be worth 2 bitcoins. Then 1 bitcoin for a gram of speed would be underprized. <br />But I&#039;m guessing that both the vendors and customers have this issue and the vendors adjust the prices semi-accordingly.<br /><br />We probably need more legit dealers for the prices to drop, while they need more customers so they might raise the prices.<br />Or you need to get more money somehow so you don&#039;t care ;)<br /><br />Or you could change your opinion about it. <br />Like I don&#039;t really care that coke, crack and heroin are overpriced, since they are quite addictive and expensive at the same time. It&#039;s easy to abuse and it generally doesn&#039;t make people better in any way imo.<br /><br />I think SR is pretty amazing. Except for the prices and me not being 100% sure that it&#039;s safe, it&#039;s indeed like a wet dream come true ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Wow, xtc is 20+ euros for just one pill on here. Do people actually buy that?<br />I mean.. then one party with 2 redoses would could 60 euros 72+ dollars. Totally insane, especially if you consider that the pills are bought in bulk and one pill is 1 euro, so selling 1 pill here makes at least 15 euros.<br /><br />I&#039;m starting to think that it&#039;s mostly useful to be a vendor if you live here because buying on &quot;the streets&quot; is a million times cheaper.<br /><br />Hopefully this will change someday so I can actually start buying without wasting a fortune.

				If you get a quality vendor with a source straight from the source its worth every penny , cuts out all karma/blood that goes with drug gangs&nbsp; &amp; L.E<br />Never mind the cutting agents<br /><br />More than 90% of all cocaine entering the United States is cut with the amphetamine-type stimulant levamisole before it crosses the border. Levamisole, a deworming agent for pets, is used as a cutting agent because it allows the product to retain the sheen or shiny effect of pure fishscale coke. However, levamisole consumption can result in a condition known as agranulocytosis, which precipitates a complete crash of the immune system. This cutting agent has resulted in a full blown public health epidemic in the US, and there are now widespread reports of habitual users contracting flesh eating viruses as a result of weakened immune systems.<br /><br />Google for more information about cocaine cut with levamisole in the USA.

				Like many of you have said, some drugs are fairly priced and others not. It makes me sad is the markup for H. I know for a fact some of these vendors sell stuff at 2X+ the price they pay. I understand that people want to make money but getting 2 free grams for every gram you sell is nuts IMO. I feel like many of these people sell to support their habits and the prices will stay high as long as people are willing to pay. It makes me kinda sad but oh well. Thus is the market price for anonymous drug dealing. :-\

				Why are drugs on SR so expensive? --<br /><br />Its supply and demand. In real life drugs travel to the major cities. From the major cities drugs flow out and as the flow of drugs travels further away from cities there is less supply and the demand is greater. Most city dwellers will find it easy to acquire drugs locally. While people in rural areas, despite their willingness to pay more then city goers, often find themselves sober due to low supplies outside of cities! So we may be seeing many users that are turning to SR and buying up the drugs on the internet that arnt around locally, and they are willing to pay more

				Basically, I found out through ACTUAL SILK ROAD VENDORS, their reason behind the high prices is that if you&#039;re poor well too bad you can&#039;t pay the premium prices because there are rich people who can and will pay premium prices!!!!!

				Because there are people unlucky enough not to have any connections, and for whom this site is their only resources. If you&#039;re selling out all the time, vendors will put up their prices to compensate for overdemand. SR tax and shipping, as well as overheads like packaging probably bump the price up a bit, but I genuinely think that vendors know and will charge more (not that there is anything wrong with that). <br /><br />Although I will admit that the uk weed prices are really shit here...<br /><br />

				Cocaine prices are a complete joke, I seriously believe they only people purchasing coke are the people who have zero IRL access to it.<br /><br />Even if SR coke is purer and &quot;straight from the kilo&quot;, with these prices you&#039;re still paying the same, 1g SR = 3.5g street.<br /><br />You would think SR vendors would get able to sell cheaper better quality coke since they&#039;re buying bigger quantities but can still sell at retail prices. You can grantee a street dealer isn&#039;t buying a kg.

				I came here for one reason and one reason only. MDMA. In my city EVERYONE I know is having a hard time finding good quality shit for a good price. You want to pay 10 bucks for a 1 point cap? lol good luck not getting cut up or bunk shit and even the &quot;good&quot; shit costs 20 bucks for a point but isnt all that good, but its the best I can find. We used to have a nice market here until somehow it just went all to shit. I bought 300 mg for 60 bucks 3 weeks before I came here and it was the best I could do after going through 10 dealers. Once I came here about 2 weeks ago I made a purchase from a vendor in the Netherlands, it was cheap and he was new I had no idea what I was getting myself into even after reading the guides and was scared that all of the sudden someone in customs would seize my package and bust down my door still I was tired of the shit being pass off as good on my streets and to me. it was 30 bucks for the whole gram and when it came I didnt expect it to be so good but let me tell you I fell in love &lt;3. I tried ordering from other vendors but my packages have not came yet I will look forward to getting my packages from my original vendor and just count the other dollars as &quot;probing costs&quot; until they arrive if ever. I also learned not to FE (lol what a noob). POINT is however I was able to find good shit for cheap as fuck and if I wanted I could make tons selling pure shit on my streets for cheaper and get us back to a better market at home. Its all relative to where you live. I have no idea about other drugs cause I don&#039;t do them. Shrooms are a bit overpriced and almost makes me want to start growing again to sell them here cheaper to force other vendors to go down in price as well.

SR also has the valuable feedback, all of the people buying on here obviously want to stay anonymous , that comes at a price and&nbsp; having the gear being delivered to the door by the postman .

				I registered a few days ago and looking at the prices i have no idea what in the fuck OP is talking about. Cheapest mdma prices i&#039;ve ever seen, way better than street price. Shrooms are pretty cheap too. <br /><br />The weed has a bit of a premium(to me anyways where i&#039;m from we have medical :P), but i assume that has a lot to do with how hard the smell is to mask. For the seller, I imagine this &quot;premium&quot; on weed has entirely to do with the risk of sending it, vs something something like a pill which can be much easier to mask.<br /><br />All in all, I am more than satisfied with SR&#039;s prices. I believe they are perfectly fair for what you are getting, considering you don&#039;t have to deal with some shady drug dealer in a back ally, or go through your friend&#039;s friend&#039;s friend, and it&#039;s shipped right to you&#039;re door. I dreamed about this for years, too fearful to check it out because i didn&#039;t want my hopes dashed, or it getting shutdown right after i got into using it. This site has stood the test of time in my book, and to be honest all you people whining either need to go out and find you&#039;re own drug connects, or own up and pay some serious props to the people who risk their lives everyday to get you high

				I find it funny how many vendors ITT praise their kind as &quot;businessman&quot; and &quot;providers of high quality products&quot; while in fact I&#039;ve encountered more than 1 scammer here, people with shit quality weed, fake lsd, horrible shipping times and all other kinds of bullshit. I also think it&#039;s safe to say that it&#039;s unfair to say that the buyer pays for increased anonymity while the sellers actually also profits from it. Increased shipping cost is also a really bad excuse since 90% of the time the buyer is the one who selects the shipping option and pays the according or sometimes outrageous high prices. 6 bucks for a domestic bubble envelop is hardly justified if it comes on top of an already high price for the ware.<br /><br />Prices are the way they are because people pay them and the opiate market is not big enough to let the vendors actually compete with each other.<br />I have my 2 or 3 vendors that I really trust with fair prices&nbsp; but some people here are just making a fool out of themselves when defending certain business models ;)

				I have to agree about shipping.&nbsp; <br /><br />Often I will find a good price for a product.&nbsp; Maybe something like 25 bucks for a 5 pack of perc 5&#039;s.<br /><br />Whoops the vendor wants .9 BTC to ship it first class!!!! No WAY!&nbsp; Some people may not notice this type of minor rip off, but I sure do!

				Sure if you&#039;re in Netherlands then of course everything on here seems overpriced.&nbsp; But in a lot of the less enlightened countries a lot of this stuff is close to or less than street prices maybe excepting coke, H &amp; meth.

				Haven&#039;t read the whole thread, but seems like a lot of whining on the part of a few. By all means if you can secure better prices elsewhere, DO SO! For a middle aged fart such as myself living in a city that is more about meth and weed and who seeks mainly specialty products like psychedelics including RC&#039;s and occasional X, this site is perfect and have no issues re the prices. Starting out&nbsp; a bit too eager, made some mistakes and paid way too much--since then as I have become comfortable with the Road and now devote the considerable time needed to properly comparison shop--which in itself is a ball and often very educational. Now I get the XX as in fair sex thing with window shopping.&nbsp; Nowhere in my experience here in the USA do you ever have the op to buy drugs that have been taste and lab tested from almost anywhere in the world with escrow protection. <br /><br />Are u kidding? What are my alternatives--head down to the local drug district and approach strangers who look like they might have what I want? Right, nil chance. DPR has done something brilliant here and the community seems to be getting that much stronger. And huge kudos to the volunteers such as LSD Avengers who by devoting the time and energy to the issue of quality/pricing have caused substantial gains across the boards. If your drug of choice doesn&#039;t have such staffing, start it! Free enterprise + sound feedback = best bang/buck.<br />LL
