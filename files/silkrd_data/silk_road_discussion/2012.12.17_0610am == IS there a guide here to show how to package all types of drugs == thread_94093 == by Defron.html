				Buy drugs from vendors and see how they package their stuff. Use the same methods for your packages and try to improve it...<br /><br />Common sense, there is no need for tutorial. This is not photoshop. You got to prison, you&#039;re not getting a bad grade!

				A guide would kind of defeat the purpose of stealth packaging. The idea is to be as creative as possible, and to try to avoid tricks that customs/postal workers have grown accustomed to. As others have said, it may be helpful to make small orders from vendors well known for their stealth.<br /><br />But make sure you vacuum seal your product, use a legit return address, and print your labels.<br /><br />I wish you a fruitful and profitable career as a drug dealer ;)

For all we know you might be customs trying to get some ideas on how things are packed (never said you were, never said you weren&#039;t, never said anything). The second a detailed&nbsp; guide is put on the forums you can forget about following most of it as we have no real way of knowing who is going to view this material. Giving this advice over PMs will not solve this.<br /><br />IMAHO, I don&#039;t think dealers (including established ones but new to SR) should vend without buying from others first to see how THEY do it and which methods best serve them.
