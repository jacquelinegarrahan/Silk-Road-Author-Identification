				I&#039;m looking out for the interest of myself as a buyer and others on SR.<br /><br />My issue for the rating system is that, I DEPEND HEAVILY ON THE RATINGS of sellers.<br /><br />I think the rating system for SR is too simple, not enough detail. I know allot of people are on SR because of the anonymity aspect, but I do know that the people on here are somewhat intelligent, bright people(well most).<br /><br />A difference of +/- 1 could make it break it for a buyer or seller, and this is why I came up with an idea...<br /><br />perhaps- A three category rating system: (1-10) for Communication, (1-10) for Description accuracy and actual product, (1-10) for shipment/delivery/speed<br /><br />and either average out these 3 scores or list them separately.<br /><br />I thought of this real quick and this topic is more meant for discussion and improvement upon the great SR. I see something great in this website and only want to help it grow and be more efficient.<br /><br />So, what do you guys think? Buyers? Sellers? Don&#039;t like the idea? sAY something!

				I&#039;ve already suggested this.<br /><br />Just copy the ebay rating system so that buyers and sellers can be rated.

				We aren&#039;t copying anyone. We don&#039;t need more enemies. I think this is a good idea, but I would much rather see ratings depend on the price of the product sold. A $1,000 purchase should be worth more than a $3 one, wouldn&#039;t you agree?

				I&#039;m very new to the SR community so forgive me if this is wrong but if there was an ebay-esque rating system on SR wouldn&#039;t that make it easier for potential LE to target &quot;power seller&#039;s&quot;

				The power sellers can already be found by sorting listings from &quot;bestselling&quot; to worst.<br /><br />I think most of the ideas here are great, although I liked to simplistic approach it has right now... maybe some sort of compromise.<br /><br />I like having one overall rating number, but maybe have ratings show the $$$ amount spent next to them.<br /><br />Or give the seller a rating that is weighted based on dollar amount and when you go in to check out the rating further, it is divided into multiple ratings - (100) for $0, (90) for $.01-$.100.00 and (80) for $100.01+ <br /><br />Not so simple after those changes I suppose...<br /><br />

				The rating system doesn&#039;t really matter too much. If you want real reviews on a vendor, look towards the forums and try to find reviews from longstanding, active members.<br /><br />Almost all suggested changes to the system can still be affected by vendor&#039;s selling to themselves, early finalizing, etc. Even rating feedback from buyers with multiple transactions would not provide foolproof ratings

				I think the rating system as it is works just fine - provided you also use the forums to research vendors.&nbsp; It amazes me that so many people never even visit the forum.&nbsp; You can save yourself a lot of time and money by just reading up on people.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t believe EVERYTHING you read.&nbsp; Be careful, stay skeptical.

It would really be a GREAT feature that could help prevent someone who would just go about selling virtual goods, and then eventually move on to selling drugs after they have 100+ transactions. Then they can scam 10+ people before they&#039;re feedback takes a hit and during that time they just keep selling virtual goods to suppress the reviews. Some timemachine guy or something like that just got finished doing that.

				I don&#039;t know if SR does this, but I think it&#039;d be a good idea to weight a seller&#039;s rank by the credibility of the reviewer providing the feedback.<br /><br />So negative feedback from more credible reviewers would be more damaging, while positive feedback from more credible reviewers would be less damaging.<br /><br />A reviewer&#039;s reputation could be based on such factors as purchase history, duration as a SR member, frequency of purchases, ratings assigned to other vendors (e.g., someone difficult to please will tend to give everyone bad ratings, while easily pleased buyers will tend to give everyone positive ratings), etc.

				I liked the ratings system until one bad feedback made me go from 100% to 93%, I&#039;ve got pages of 5/5 ratings and now suddenly I&#039;ve got a rubbish rating because of one guy, who didn&#039;t contact me with a problem, and left no clue what the problem was. How can I fix it if I don&#039;t know what the problem was, its unhelpful to both me and my buyers. <br />The weighting system based on transaction value, and buyer credibility is too sensitive, open to abuse, and essentially undemocratic.
