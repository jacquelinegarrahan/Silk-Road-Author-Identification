				Money pak has cracked down...Vendors have a daily limit and dont want small MPs because they make less profit. <br />That and escrow takes so much profit from the btc vendors as it is.

Did you even message BTC buddy before you did business with him? Because I messaged him the other day asking if he could do a smaller purchase, and he told me he could not at this time. If you did message him and get the OKAY before you send your MP, maybe you should message him again asking how long it will take before your btc comes in. Please be patient and understanding, BTC buddy is only human, be patient before you call a well respected vendor a scammer.

				I have been seeing post after post about this scam lately. I would NEVER use this method, even with a trusted vendor. Just because the price is too high. If you add the price of the MP and then the percentage taken off by the vendor, then include the risk of being totally scammed, it&#039;s just not worth it. I funded my acct the same day using bitinstant. I deposited the cash in their bank at 10am and by 3pm I was making my first order. I think I paid $10 on $200. No disrespect intended to any legit and trusted BTC vendors. It&#039;s only one guy talking.

				@happy- I thought all the MP to BTC vendors took a small cut. Why would they do it for free? The real cost isn&#039;t in the price of the MP or the small % to the vendor. The real cost is the risk of losing your whole MP. You have to factor the risk into the equation. You have to trust a human being. And The Machines of Loving Grace told me &quot;Don&#039;t place faith in human beings. Human beings are unreliable things.&quot; And like I said before- no disrespect intended to legit BTC vendors. Theirs is the fastest way to fund an acct so they DO provide a service. Just my .02
