				SRs stated fees really dont matter because SR changed the fees to higher amounts as he feels like it without any notification.

				Okay? I just want to know what the fees are... As long as they&#039;re not over 20-30% then I can make a nice profit while providing excellent prices....

				10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /><br />But it usually ends up being a little bit more than that.

				That&#039;s the commission schedule, charged on every sale. The fee for a vendor account is $150, I think. Re-reading you post, you prob knew that, though.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also, I don&#039;t think Smashin is correct, if SR just changed commissions whenever he felt like, I think we&#039;d hear about it from some of the vendors when it happened... (It did happen once, though.)

				10% for the first $50?<br /><br />Does that mean me selling a gram of weed for $20, I get $18 of it?

				The above figures are my understanding of the fees too, I plan on opening an account at the end of the month.<br /><br />I think the high fees to become a seller are to deter scammers, although the feedback system seems a good way to do this too.<br /><br />One more point of note is about &quot;hedging&quot; whereby in exchange for 4% of the sale, the dollar value of your buyer&#039;s purchase is kept static until they finalise the transaction. This is apparently very useful given the volatility of the Bitcoin but if you&#039;re not waiting on the money it might be better to forgo the 4% and once you have your BTC simply wait until their equal or greater in value to when you made the sale.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear some vendors thoughts on this as I&#039;m planning on offering GBP (cash in envelope) in exchange for BTC and as overheads are tight, I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s worth the trouble.<br /><br />V.

				when you set your prices on items you can set the price before SR commission. then they just add the commission on top of the price. you can also list prices after commission. fun stuff.

				Hi,<br /><br />it is my understanding that the chart you posted is the fees that buyers have to pay on top of what you charge.<br /><br />I sold an item for 35 bucks and SR took 70 cents so 2% fee for vendors ?<br /><br />Correct me if I am wrong.<br /><br /><br />regards/<br />Fred
