				How long did the small orders take to get to you? <br /><br />Is it domestic/international? <br /><br />It wouldnt have lost your BTC, he would just have cancelled your order. The vendor is running a business and did what they had to to protect it. <br /><br />He has said 0% refund, which is allowed.. If the terms are made clear to your beforehand then I don&#039;t see a problem. If these terms weren&#039;t, you can take it to the resolution center and will probably be given a 50% refund. <br /><br />How long has it been since you placed the larger order?

				I am a bit confused. Did you FE on the last order or not? <br /><br />If you didn&#039;t then just go to resolutions. If he can not show he sent you anything than you should get your money back regardless of his policy. A no refund policy does not shield him from scamming. <br /><br />I am at a loss to understand why you placed a big order with him.<br /><br />There are plenty of good vendors here that you don&#039;t have to take risks.<br /><br />If a vendor told me to FE after I paid.I would have politely told him to cancel my order.<br /><br />If you did free early than nothing can be done except leave neg feedback and let the forum know. <br /><br />Hope it all works out for you. Good luck.<br /><br />

				Dont F.E. I ve got to say&nbsp; i had to FE when i first started on SR, but lucky me, none of the vendors selectively scammed me. Nowdays i do not FE to any vendors, sometimes i do it with vendors i ve built a bussines relationship with, even though iam not required to F.E, i just do it because im nice. However you never know when a vendor can go rogue (lucydrop)

				Joolz!<br /><br />If the transaction is still in the resolution center, YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SCAMMED.<br />Just because he says 0% refund doesn&#039;t mean that&#039;s what you have to accept.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t mark the transaction as received by the end of the time limit allowed, it will be handed off to SR admins to decide on.&nbsp; They will likely give you a 50% refund.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter what the seller says to you AFTER the fact.

				got this today&nbsp; scout&nbsp; were are you ! you wanna see the message<br />come on Sr<br /><br /><br />.Hi m8, i have a little bit i would like to add about this vendor but i am unable to post due to being fairly new to this forum,<br />So i am wondering if you would post my comment for me, no problem if not, i don&#039;t even know if you are allowed to do this,<br />Also feel free to edit my post if you wish, as my grammar is not the best.<br />But anyway here is what happened when i ordered a bit of hash around two months ago.<br />Regards,<br />CM.<br /><br />I placed an order with Ananas Express around two months ago for a small bit of hash,<br />I then received a message telling me to f/e and i replied stating that I have had over 400 orders so why do i need to f/e and they Replied saying that it has to be 5+ purchases with THEM or its f/e.<br />So i f/e&#039;d, 3 weeks later when i still had not received any hash from them, I sent them a normal polite message inquiring as to<br />The whereabouts of my order and what do you think the reply from this so called professional reliable vendor was?<br /><br />&quot;FUCK YOU!!!&quot;<br /><br />That is exactly what their message to me said, nothing more, nothing less. i still have the message in my buyer account.<br />I have to say i am from the rougher side of society but their response totally shocked even me.<br />I messaged them again, this time to ask why they felt the need to respond in that manner but received no reply, so i done<br />What comes natural in situations like this - a 1/5 rating along with a few choice words in their feedback, 2 weeks later i<br />Received a message from them saying that if i change my feedback then they will throw in a free gram on my next order!!!<br />Wtf? What a bloody cheek, but i thought about it for a few days and i did not see any other negative feedback on their page<br />And decided that they must have been having a bad week when i received their abusive message and it was just a one off,<br />So i messaged them saying that i don&#039;t want their hash free or otherwise and that the only reason that i am changing the<br />Feedback is because i am a vendor myself and would not like that to happen to me, i changed the feedback to 5/5 and left the comments box empty and i never received so much as a &quot;thank you&quot; or even a &quot;sorry&quot; from these selective scammers and<br />That is just what they are, and now that i am seeing that mine was not a one case off then i think i will go back and change<br />The rating and feedback again, if i had just left the feedback as it should have been then maybe joolz here might not have made an order with them and not been selectively scammed like he has been.<br />Definitely avoid at all costs.
