				I created an account here over 2 months ago, right before the site got everywhere. It&#039;s below 2500, but still kinda up there. I would ONLY sell it to a BUYER that is also under 2500, and what I&#039;m hoping to do is give my account away to someone that has a buyer account under 2500 and has been around awhile but didnt get around to signing up for a selling account before shit got crazy. My main account is also one that is under 2500.<br /><br />The account has never been used, but is a selling account. If it cannot be sold for whatever reason, then that&#039;s fine. I will find some use for it. But selling it would be an easier way for me to get BTC at the moment than any other option. I&#039;m not even sure how much I&#039;d sell it for, I suppose whatever people think it&#039;d be worth to them. Anyway, an answer to this would be great. I wont proceed with anything until I know whether it&#039;d be okay or not, because I&#039;m not here to break rules. I love this place, I buy from this place. After I get an answer, feel free to message me. I&#039;ll probably make another post if I get the OK, to see if there&#039;s even interest. Thanks everyone.

				I am against it in principal but you have addressed most of my moralistic concerns. One thought is that you got it for free and now a buyer would not pay Silk for its worth. Anyone Old School would not buy from you because they probably already a seller account so you may be tempted to sell to a recent addition which I (and you apparently also) would consider dishonest. I suggest you announce the sale and the buyer publicly at the very least and discuss how you would get Silk his cut.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What is the name? Is it so clever it is worth something?

				I see nothing good can come from this except you make money.<br /><br />Whoever buys the account is trying to represent something they are not.<br />I se a lot of seller accounts up for sale, which means a buyer can&#039;t even fully trust a seller who has a good rep. Just Great :(<br />
