				I put three orders in with wheels420 but he hasn&#039;t logged in in 2 days... not sure if anything happened, hopefully not! I order on Saturday and was really hoping to receive the order by Wednesday. Anyone have any info to shed some light on the situation?

				Currently having the same issue. Order will be avail. to cancel in 17hrs.<br /><br />Unacceptable.<br /><br />Order placed the 12th, still &quot;processing&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m not a noob, nor a bitchy customer, but I find this unacceptable. Surely there is a reason though. Wheels- We need some input on this subject.<br /><br />-onion-

				Still &quot;processing...&quot;... I ordered on Friday, it&#039;s now Wednesday? What seems to be the issue, wheels420? Can you refund or actually send it out or respond to some pm&#039;s?

				This is what I posted in the wheels review thread:<br /><br />Mine was moved to shipped on Monday I believe. But that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean anything.<br /><br />I have voiced my annoyance to the vendor, and did receive an apology and due to a back log they were playing catch up and my order as well as others&#039; orders were being processed.<br /><br />When you have a gut feeling...don&#039;t ignore it. It&#039;s the only time I&#039;ve ever been led astray on the road is when I did something my gut told me not to do.<br /><br />We will see when my order shows up, and when it was actually postmarked. I have had many many orders come without issues like this.<br /><br />-onion-<br />
