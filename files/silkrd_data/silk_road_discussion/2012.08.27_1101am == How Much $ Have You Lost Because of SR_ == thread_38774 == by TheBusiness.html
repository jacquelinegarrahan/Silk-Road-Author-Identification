				OP - Just out of interest, which particular drugs did you lose your money on? I&#039;ve got a theory that depending on which category of drugs you choose to buy from, determines what kind of experience you get from the Road. For example, on a rare occasion I&#039;ll order some Hash, and every time I have the vendors seem to take an age to put it in transit.<br /><br />It&#039;s just a theory I&#039;ve got.&nbsp;

				Its kinda true but kinda not<br /><br />I mean in the world of weed you&#039;re less likely to get ripped off than the world of heroin buts generally cuz people are friends in the weed world first and less likely to be in serious WD etc<br /><br />but on SR I don&#039;t think it makes a lot of diff - its all vendors, some honest, some scam, some in between the the 2 seeing how far they can push it.<br /><br />

				Not a particular kind really. I&#039;m not overly concerned, this isn&#039;t McDonalds heh. :) Didn&#039;t get burned as bad as I thought I would when I was new here, it actually just seems to be part of it all even now. I do wonder if perfect buyer stats make you a target for scamming though.

				When first trying to get a vendor account I lost either $300 because that&#039;s what I asked for or $600 which was what the fentanyl patches I sent were worth.<br /><br />Lost over £400 recently because of a bitcoin scam or a bitcoin vendor getting busted nobody knows yet.

You are a good example for others.<br /><br />I think the title of this thread needs to be changed to &quot;How Much $ Have You Lost ON SR?&quot;. SR didn&#039;t make you do anything - they simply provide a safe meeting place for us to interact. They sure aren&#039;t trying to protect you from yourself, that is clear.&nbsp; They have provided a way to protect you from those you do business with (escrow) but if you don&#039;t use it that is your own choice.<br /><br />It bothers me to hear so many people have been scammed here. It hurts faith in the marketplace, and that hurts good buyers and vendors alike. As buyers you need to raise your standards and only deal with members who do not require FE. If you loose money during a transaction which was FE then it really was your own fault. <br /><br />Am I missing something or is everyone just getting scammed with FE? Are there other scams in the mix here?

				Ohh the old days. Like 8 months ago i&#039;ve lost around 400$ over a period of 2 weeks. But after checking the matter it turned out to be the fucking postman who stole the orders not a case of selective scamming as i thought before. Other than that my business was smooth like silk, despite using multiple vendors and some were new to the scene.

				I got scammed by Obamagirl i think was the vendors name, it was like 50-60$ over a g of MDMA, finalized early cus i was new and then i come to the forums and everyone said she was a scammer. Of course i never received my shit.<br /><br />After that I&#039;ve never Finalized early and i never intend too. I&#039;ve received every order, some NL orders have taken quite awhile, but they always came in. I&#039;ve been waiting 3 weeks for an order from abzu, if that shit doesn&#039;t come in I&#039;m pushing to get all my btc back, but there seems to be a lot of people waiting longer than usual on orders, especially from that part of the world. <br /><br /><br />But yeah, S.R. has definitely helped me way more than set me back. It&#039;s got a great system, and a great community.

				Maby I´m just very lucky or I over analyze each buy, but in 11 transactions ( I realize its not very much) I´ve lost nothing at all..&nbsp; But then I do spend ages on the sellers pages, reading feedback looking for patterns, seeing if the sellers behavior is normal for them and looking at announcements in the forums, checking if there&#039;s a high loss rate from the sellers country..&nbsp; All my purchases have been smallish, grams here and there&nbsp; no bulk.... yet<br /><br />ACE

				I&#039;ve spent about $300 so far I lost about $20 but this was awhile back, eventually bitcoins a appreciated and I was able to get the same product from another vendor, so no real loss.

I know of people also that get their friends to place orders for them if they have better stats.. it just avoids the stance sellers are taking now of under 10 transactions you have to FE..

				I would say that even more of a problem then losing money is paying premium prices from well established vendors with great reviews and receiving mediocre at best products. Happens far too often around this place.
