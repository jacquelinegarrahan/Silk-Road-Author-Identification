				Hello,<br /><br />Been here on the forums all day reading and looking into certain speculations and theories behind this attack (mainly for some updates from DPR!). First off I&#039;d like to thank DPR and his team for their continued dedication to this project, we are all here for you with our heads up high. <br /><br />Basically I started doing a bit of research of my own and I came across this:<br /><br />(CLEARNET)&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/spamhaus-ddos-suspect-arrested/240153788 <br /><br />It&#039;s basically an article on how Spanish police arrested the man behind the worlds biggest DDoS attack ever. At a point its said his attack peaked 300 gigabits per second, this attack also is said to have slowed down or even crippled the internet for some users are the world. <br /><br />quote from the article:<br />According to the High Tech Crime Team police unit in the Netherlands, the DDoS attacks launched against Spamhaus -- of which Kamphuis is being accused -- targeted servers in the United States, United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and employed fake IP addresses. The DDoS attacks gained notoriety by peaking at an unprecedented 300 gigabits per second, leading some commentators to falsely assert that the attacks slowed down the Internet. <br /><br />I find it a bit unusual that only a couple days after his arrest (Friday April 26th). SR started getting hit by these sophisticated DDoS attacks. Could it be the LEO broke him a deal? Maybe testing out his skills for bigger things to come with all this &quot;cyber warfare&quot; scare going around recently?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know....just some food for thought in these ratchet times. Anyhow I again wish DPR and his staff the very best in over coming this and know we will be up very soon...I CAN FEEL IT.<br /><br />LONG LIVE THE ROAD.

				I have a suspicion that it is the same person that is DDoSing many other websites this week and extorting them for money.&nbsp; Someone has been doing the same exact thing to many other bitcoin related websites and websites that sell steroids.<br /><br />Here is one of his extortion letter for bitcoinstore.com<br />http://bitcoinstore.tumblr.com/

				I&#039;m sorry I didn&#039;t see you already brought it up. Also yes, he is indeed in jail, but as we know and have seen from time to time, governments and LE do not have a problem with using these &quot;criminals&quot; to do their bigger evil deeds. Such &quot;white collar&quot; crimes have heftier jail sentences than murder and kidnapping in some places (here in Canada wire fraud can get you 10 years+, where as some murderers and rapists get 4-5 years jail time and house arrest as probation). They could most defiantly have used that against him and use him for such attacks.<br /><br />Hey, look at Frank Abagnale and how much he contributed to economic and monetary security after his arrest. Most cash note and cheque security features world wide were designed with his help.<br />

				White collar crimes have smaller sentences than drugs or murder in the US.&nbsp; Go to federal prison and you&#039;ll see.&nbsp; So many people in there with petty sentences for while collar crimes that that profited a small fortune from.

				I guess it&#039;s always possible though.&nbsp; He was arrested in Spain earlier this week.&nbsp; So if what you are suggesting is true then i presume that the government of Spain would have to be in on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />What do you think about my suspicion?&nbsp; Seriously...&nbsp; The guy I&#039;m talking about has been doing this exact thing to many other bitcoin sites and sites that sell illegal drugs for like a week now.

				That can most defiantly be plausible too. With Bitcoin gaining more and more recognition in the media lately (and for some reason always being linked to SR), cyber-hijacking is not something out of the norm... same thing after pirates (the bad ones!) seen the money they can make by hijacking oil tankers&nbsp; can most defiantly be the situation here. I believe even though TOR is &quot;anonymous and encrypted&quot;, it was still created by humans and there will always be compromises. No system is perfect. <br /><br />Basically wherever there is money to be made....there are going to be people in line to get it. The community should not be panicking as wheres a will there&#039;s a way, no way will we be giving this up just because some greedy mofos want a piece of the pie. As Ben Cunningham leader of the Tea Party said:<br /><br />&quot;we are not about to be led by a bunch of timid Washington, D.C. Brahmins who are interested in making a buck off of people they see as naive. Either join us in the fight or get the hell out of the way.&quot;
