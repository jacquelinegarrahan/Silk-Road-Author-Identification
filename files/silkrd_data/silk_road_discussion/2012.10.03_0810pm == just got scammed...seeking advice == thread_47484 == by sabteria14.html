				I just received a box with delivery confirmation and instead of being filled with contraband, it had some crackers. Fortunately my buyer stats are pretty good and extensive but the merchant also has very good feedback so far. It is a rather new merchant but I cannot be sure which yet because I am still waiting on two other orders. Once I find out which of the three scammed me, I will post who it was in the forums and contact SR support seeking a refund. Does anyone have tips eg who specifically to contact in the forums to get this vendor listed as a selective scammer, what portion of the forums to make a new topic indicting the vendor by name etc? I appreciate all the help, this is a bit ridiculous.

				Crackers....seriously?<br /><br />I really feel your pain brother, and this is a shame for sure, but some devious part of me has to chuckle about the crackers.<br /><br />Anyways, serious bullshit going on here. I was always wondering how delivery confirmation would be of any help in case of a scammer. They get the confirmation, buyer gets fucked. :/

You need to contact support on SILK ROAD and go thru the normal procedure in filing a claim. I know it totally sucks, that you are going to have to wait a while no matter what, and that it is your word vs the vendor.<br /><br />I do think you should call this vendor out. <br /><br />This is the exact thing Rumor mill is for. <br />A legit buyer... in you... that has a legit complaint. You NEED to do this to protect other buyers.<br /><br />&nbsp;Most of the time some idiot puts up something about being scammed and it is total bullshit, they always use a new fake name and it is usually their first post with that account. None of that applies to you.<br /><br />Also the way you described it...there is NO WAY for the vendor can talk himself out of it or to say that he &quot;forgot&quot; to put the drugs in. He tried and did pull of a scam. A stupid one at that..And one that would never work.<br /><br />I do think you should contact the vendor first as that would be the FASTEST way to get your funds back would be by him refunding you. It would also give him an &quot;out&quot; to fix a wrong. I say this because you say he has good feedback. If this is the case maybe for some stupid stupid reason he did this and knows he did and wants to make it right in order to save his stats on his reputation. So you should make a deal that you will not post in the forums or leave him 5 of 5 as you just want to be refunded and move on.<br /><br />Then when you get your refund...OUT THIS FUCKING LOSER!!!! The road does not need this piece of shit vendor!<br /><br />Just keep us updated!<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br /><br />PS.. Did you FE?

				hmm..<br />i am sure LE do sometimes keep the product and consume it themselves and anyone shutting that idea out.. just hasn&#039;t been in this game that long.<br />i, personally, know people have been busted by sheriffs and that sheriff turned around and got caught selling drugs/firearms he had seized<br />from raids on multiple targets... and well the person he was selling them to was FBI... who was down investigating some stuff about<br />the crooked activity in that county&#039;s sheriff department. <br />and.. everyone whose house got raided/arrested with that sheriff&#039;s signature/name on the warrants, all charges were dropped.<br /><br />point being: COPS ARE CROOKED. i am sure if it was not a large order, like 1gram-an eighth... cops are<br />a. going to keep it <br />or<br />b. send it on its way.<br /><br />you really think cops have the time/money/manpower to go and CD every drop that gets caught with a very minimal amount of contraband in the package?<br />come on now.. cops are dumb but not THAT dumb. they keep drugs. they sell them, they do them. cops lives are stressful, i imagine.<br />not just on the job but also at home while your wives are out whoring around with your &quot;best friends&quot;.<br />and something that might help... STOP GETTING PACKAGES SENT TO THAT/THOSE DROP(S).<br /><br />any who, LIFE HAPPENS.. fuck.<br />just some .02btc from some real life experiences, not juts rage-o-nomics.<br /><br /><br />/thumbs
