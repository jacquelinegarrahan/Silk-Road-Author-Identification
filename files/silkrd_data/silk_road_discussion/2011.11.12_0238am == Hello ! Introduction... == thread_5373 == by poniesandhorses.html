				Hi, I just started here and I&#039;ve been reading through threads and stuff.&nbsp; What an awesome place!&nbsp; I would like to become a real part of this community someday, maybe even make a few friends eventually.&nbsp; I&#039;m 30ish female, from Florida.&nbsp; Looking forward to trying out quality vendors, since everything I&#039;ve seen for the last 10 years is garbage. <br />&nbsp;If it all works out, I have a couple of &quot;friends&quot; that could use this website to create a bigger business, especially this one guy who is super paranoid.&nbsp; He won&#039;t even come out of this house.&nbsp; He uses his mailbox&nbsp; lol.<br />&nbsp; Currently I&#039;m living in the Atlanta area and semi retired, woot.&nbsp; I play nine-ball, used to be pro-am.&nbsp; I live out the middle of nowheresville, so I don&#039;t really know anyone like me, as in, non redneck, layed back and fun.&nbsp; So it&#039;s a pretty lonely lifestyle.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I&#039;m moving back to Florida next year.&nbsp; I go to clubs sometimes, but that&#039;s pretty boring alone so I don&#039;t bother.&nbsp; Plus, clubs in Atlanta aren&#039;t the best.&nbsp; I used to work at the stripclubs in Atlanta, so it&#039;s not like I&#039;m not pretty enough for the crowd.&nbsp; I&#039;m just more settled down in my thirties.&nbsp; <br />Yeah there&#039;s lots of personal info here, but I think I&#039;ve been a little careful as to what I included.&nbsp; So anyways, that&#039;s all about me.&nbsp; Questions comments?&nbsp;

				Hey Ponies - welcome from another southern gal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent hours upon hours reading here myself - its terribly interesting.&nbsp; I have to say out of all that reading, I know more about you than anyone else on here.&nbsp; Is that good or bad?&nbsp; Dunno.&nbsp; It is what it is, I guess.&nbsp; Hope to see you around - its a pretty nice crowd here - an interesting one, if nothing else!&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Have you got all the BTC&#039;s and PGP&#039;s figured out?

				Yes delete that stuff.<br /><br />Agreed though clubs with friends is fun, going alone isn&#039;t that cool.

				Welcome to the great community.&nbsp; I would have to agree and say be very vague and careful with what kind of information you give out, especially if you plan on selling anything in the foreseeable future.&nbsp; The Rumor Mill is a great place to find out what most of us fanatic buyers have to say about the most reputable vendors on here.&nbsp; Enjoy your stay!
