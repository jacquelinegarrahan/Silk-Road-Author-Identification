				<br />End of the world bunker for the &quot;big day&quot; coming up. Seems its a chance to be part of an open minded community that has or will invest in property and construct an underground bunker complete with food storage and med supplies. There are people all around the world doing this. Either for the so called big day this month or whenever shit hits the fan.

				I swear on my life that was literally the first Silk Road listing that I ever saw. That was pretty confusing. I didn&#039;t know what the fuck I was looking at and almost never came back to SR. I don&#039;t know how I found it, but it was not the best first impression that&#039;s for sure.

				Real expensive for that much you could build your own complete off the grid set-up. Maybe it is utopia though in which case I guess it could be worth it.

				I would have ordered, but they&#039;re charging $40 for shipping alone, what a ripoff... <br /><br />I&#039;m a huge fan or yours as well, Bruce. Your performance in &quot;Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!&quot; as Captain Shuggazoom was truly Oscar-worthy.
