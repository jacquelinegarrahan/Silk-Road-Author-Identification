				UPDATE (04/25/2013 0445 UTC): Silk Road is available at the moment.&nbsp; This has been truly epic.&nbsp; I pray this is the end for a while.&nbsp; I need sleep.&nbsp; I will make a summary announcement once I&#039;ve had some rest and am sure this is behind us.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/24/2013 2220 UTC): We&#039;re making progress.&nbsp; The site has been open and available for about 15 minutes, but this is an arms race right now, and the attacker may still get the upper hand before we have our final victory.&nbsp; I&#039;ve paused autofinalizing, and will leave it that way for a few days after I feel everyone has had a chance to send their orders to the Resolution Center if they want to.&nbsp; Also, image uploading doesn&#039;t work for the time being.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/24/2013 1647 UTC): Nothing new to report, but I just thought I&#039;d let everyone know that I am still here and we&#039;re doing everything we can to put and end to all of this.&nbsp; I&#039;m really proud to be a part of this community.&nbsp; You all have been showing your class through all of this.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/24/2013 1222 UTC): We are starting to get a handle on how the attack is being run.&nbsp; It will likely take many hours to eventually overcome, but we are 100% committed to getting the site running in peak form again.&nbsp; It is still possible to access here and there, so we are leaving the site open for those who want to try to gain access, but it will be tough until we can effectively counter the attack.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/24/2013 0714 UTC): The downtime of the past couple days, and especially the past 24 hours has been confirmed to be due to a deliberate attack from what appears to be an individual.&nbsp; There appears to be no security breach, only disruption of availability.&nbsp; The attack appears to be DoS in nature and is likely an exploit at the Tor network level.&nbsp; The site will be down or very slow until a solution can be found, which we will work tirelessly to find.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/23/2013 2319 UTC): I&#039;m terribly sorry for the poor availability over the last few days, and especially today.&nbsp; I&#039;m having to take the site down again and we will likely be up and down for a while longer.&nbsp; Sorry I can&#039;t give you anything more specific, but we are working as hard as we can to find a solution.<br /><br />We are doing some server reconfiguration to try to improve availability.&nbsp; The site will be down while this is done, but I will keep you updated via this thread.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience.

				Hey Rob o/<br /><br />Thx for the info and while I&#039;m thanking you already: BIG THX for all the work you&#039;re doing here -- and you&#039;re doing it great!<br /><br />Any estimation how long it&#039;ll take to get the SR back rolling?<br /><br />Rock on dude o/<br /><br />Light &amp; Love,<br />∞aliaseses∞<br /><br />EDIT @FPUK<br />Maybe Rob&#039;s got a life besides SR as well and the beginning of the week is the time, he&#039;s most able to do this kind of work for all of us?! Imo your question is a bit strange -- do you think &#039;week(-days)&#039; are the same for you and me and everyone? I also heard about maintenance isn&#039;t the kind of thing that&#039;s waiting patient until everybody&#039;s ready to be confronted with but rather a thing that &#039;just comes&#039; and when it&#039;s time for it, it doesn&#039;t care if it&#039;s a monday or thursday or whateverday ;-&gt;<br /><br />Everything will be good and work well in the end ... it always does one just have to recognize ;-&gt;

				LOL @ SLASH!!<br /><br /><br />Its been super slow the last 4 to 5 days..really since it came up from the last time u took it down..<br /><br />Before that, to me it was running for me faster and smoother than i had ever seen it in a year.. I read some claim they could never log on for 3 days iv never had to log my info in more than 2 times and im in and cruising down the road..lol <br /><br />Why dont u guys DPR and Team just keep it down fix every thing that needs to be fixed, so u dont have to do this every 4 days.. If it needs to be down 2 days ppl deal with it and let it be worked on, iv got a few things on order so i know its annoying but so is this every few day thing.. and taking 15 min to read a PM and reply to one or load a page// thanks DPR AND TEAM...

				Thanks for the effort however it goes :-)<br /><br />If it does not work, please make it so messages load before the page headers so<br />we can get work done without waiting for headers and search bars etc. which take forever at times. Also, if it is within your power, let us look at one page while another one is loading. ATM, if you don&#039;t pay attention to a blank loading page, it will give up and never load. Very tedious. But, I am happy we can do things even if they are slower than a glacier :-)&nbsp; NWN

				It could be worse, he could care fook all about the site and not update anything, and let it scrum up and die slowly. Or he could not give us ANY updates...i appreciate the time he takes to keep us informed, knowing how busy he probably is.&nbsp; Downtime sucks for anything, but we all know it will be back sooner or later.

				I&#039;d rather they take the site down to fix a technical issue and maintain all of it&#039;s user&#039;s security and anonymity then to just leave it up with a known problem so that the haters stay happy.<br /><br />A bit of frustration perhap&#039;s, but i&#039;d rather you guy&#039;s keep the site as secure as possible (least you can do for the insane amount of money you&#039;ve made off seller fee&#039;s as well <br /><br />[PS: You gouge us WAY too heavily in seller fee&#039;s, I mean way too high, I lose SOO much money for seller fee&#039;s, and you guy&#039;s gotta be rich as fuck from all the sales made now over the last 2 year&#039;s, I think it&#039;s time you give us a break/cut in fee&#039;s cuz like ... you&#039;re obviously millionaires now off fee&#039;s and it takes sooo much out of every order unless you&#039;re a huge vendor :( ]<br /><br />But all you hater&#039;s should go down to your local police station right now and just turn yourselves in, because you clearly don&#039;t care about protecting yourselves on a stable, technically sound and secure drug through the mail distribution network (Silk Road !).<br /><br />Those of us who enjoy our freedom appreciate any interruption required to fix a flaw/weakness/exploitable element to Silk Road and thank you guy&#039;s maintaining it&#039;s upkeep for jumping on these problem&#039;s as soon as you can instead of leaving them wide open until you can prepare us for &#039;Scheduled Maintenance&#039;.&nbsp; Letting everyone know when you plan on scheduling a maintence is pretty silly too considering all the LE&#039;s sniffing around constantly and looking for any intelligence whatsoever to aid them in trying to take SR down.&nbsp; <br /><br />No one should know when you PLAN on taking SR down, that&#039;s how one would shoot themselves in the foot by giving LEOs intelligence, which is the most powerful thing LEOs have to stop/prevent/immobilize in this case a drug network that must be frustrating them a little bit more every day that passes and SR is still running without their ability to do dick about it.<br /><br />So thank you technical staff for keeping Silk Road running smoothly.<br /><br />Strange all these reports though from ppl who&#039;ve been saying they&#039;ve not been able to access the site for the last 4 days.&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally been on there conducting business up until today when the login page has finally been replaced with their &#039;under maintenance&#039; page ... at least for me ... have there really been people trying to login 4 day&#039;s ago and been met with the maintenance page vs. the login page? <br /><br />Or are you guys complaining about 4 day&#039;s talking about the site being slow, but still accessible?&nbsp; That as well puzzles me cuz it&#039;s been going quick as normal for me up until today and I&#039;m definitely not anyone special lol..

				Hey DPR, I don&#039;t know if you go through and read these threads, but I want to thank you for all the hard work you keep this amazing site up and working. I can assure you that the naysayers are in the minority. The rest of us know that we have done nothing to deserve this paradise you maintain, and we completely respect you. You deserve all the money you get!<br /><br />Seriously people, you shouldn&#039;t be panicking. I remember my most panicky moment was when the forums went down and the site wasn&#039;t loading. That was the closest I ever got to thinking the site was gone forever, and even then I had hope that everything was fine. Here, we have actual updates from the man himself and you&#039;re complaining to him? Go smoke a bowl and take a day&#039;s rest from ordering drugs to your doorstep. You&#039;re lucky to have that opportunity at all.

				GUYS, I&#039;ve seen these happen and things go way slow (and of course, very fast and normal) throughout the past 3-4 days and i was just &quot;shopping&quot; then for my next order (i make about 2 a month). Today was different.<br /><br />I had my bitcoins loaded faster than usual and i had to break my 6-order shopping cart into pieces to send specific stuff to each vendor. Well, that took FOREVER. And I had JUST officially finished the last order and sent it through like 10 mins before the 100% shut down.<br /><br />So, is there a chance I could lose all those orders all ready sent off? I mean my bitcoins went with each order....<br /><br />I&#039;m just saying that&#039;d be worst case scenario, I know. But my orders are safe and in the hands of the vendors, right? <br /><br />I mean SR has been fully down for over two at least now.....will we see the light soon? <br /><br />What do you guys think??<br /><br />thx<br /><br />Roth

However, Incapsula recently got a very good idea of just how large these DDoS cannons are getting.<br /><br />Last Saturday Incapsula mitigated a rather small, 4Gbps DDoS attack, but this time it had a different pattern that attracted our attention.<br />At first sight the attack seemed rather simple, generating 8 million DNS queries per second, to many domains, from spoofed IP addresses (using real domain name servers’ IPs). But this time it included a hint about where it was coming from: all that traffic was coming from the same source. Probably on the same network, maybe even the same device.<br /><br />Tracing it to a single Source - TTL Giveaway<br />Incapsula were able to trace the attack to a single source because this time the attackers slipped-up and did not randomize the requests TTLs, making all the traffic arrive with the same IP TTL.<br /><br />The TTL parameter is part of the Internet Protocol. It’s a field that designates how many routers a packet is allowed to pass before it expired. Every router along the way decrements the counter, until it expires (many diagnostic tools, like traceroute use this attribute). Of course, like many other fields, its value can be spoofed and randomized, but it is almost impossible to make millions of packets from many sources have the same TTL when they reach their destination and this is exactly what Gur Shatz, Incapsula CEO and Co-Founder saw.<br /><br /><br />Are Authoritative Name Servers next on the exploit list?<br />Another interesting point Incapsula saw, is that the spoofed addresses belonged to DNS servers, but not all were open DNS resolvers. In fact, many of these IPs were of authoritative name servers.<br /><br />The reason for the non-random selection of IPs was to avoid blacklisting mechanisms. But it means that hackers are also collecting information about authoritative name servers. Using these in reflection attacks is a bit more complicated (it means building a database of domains with large DNS responses), with much smaller amplification factor, but they are much more difficult to lock down than open DNS resolvers.<br /><br />So... what does this mean?<br />This means that the stakes just got higher. Just for comparison, at the rate of this attack, if it had used DNS amplification, with an average amplification factor of 50 - it would have generated a 200+ Gbps DDoS attack, all from a single source/computer!<br /><br />What do we know about this source?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It is either custom hardware, or a cluster of machines sharing the same network. It is (almost) impossible for a single machine to generate this kind of traffic.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It could utilize 4Gbps of upstream bandwidth, without anyone noticing.<br /><br />These days it doesn’t take a Botnet to launch massive DDoS attacks. It doesn’t even take hundreds of servers, from multiple hosting providers. That kind of massive firepower can be obtained from a single DDoS Cannon, from a single location and perhaps even one single server.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Hope this attack is stopped soon and they blow up the guy who&#039;s initiating it. <br />I just started business 1.5 weeks ago and was doing pretty damn well until this unexpected little surprise.]<br /><br />I noticed a week ago the site also wasn&#039;t terribly fast. I know tor is slow because of the routing, but it seems SR is especially slow compared to other darknet sites. Was it always like this, or has the recent exponential increase in traffic had a noticeable effect? Just curious.

				Nothing but positivity from here too. I couldn&#039;t handle the stress of maintaining SR especially knowing that while it&#039;s down I was potentially losing thousands of dollars an hour. When this gets resolved I think I&#039;ll work on maintaining a personal backup supply making sure to replace reserves with small amounts here and there. ;)

The backend server should not be a known ip/onion address, so should be available while the webserver is not. If the backend server is being attacked, that is a problem for a few reasons and points to a more sophisticated attack then simple DDOS.

				Relax guys, it&#039;s a forum post. The way it&#039;s worded tells me it&#039;s bat shit, and the obvious motive is Atlantic is a new SR competitor. I&#039;ll give anyone all my bitcoins tomorrow if news come out that SR is done.<br /><br />Just another reason to add to the list of reasons Atlantic or a competitor is fucking our shit up over here at SR...

				Is there anyway that the site could be open and limited to vendor accounts only like the last time this sort of thing happened in November I believe so that us vendors can catch up on PMs and mark orders shipped that went out yesterday.<br /><br />We appreciate all the hard work you are doing DPR I understand very little about the sort of thing you are dealing with and have full faith in you and your team that you will get things back up and running shortly.<br /><br />I fear though that when it is back up the site will continue to have problems for the first hours since so many people will be trying to log on at the same time.&nbsp; I think last time you opening it back up to vendors only for the first few hours was a smart move.&nbsp; <br /><br />Keep working tirelessly as I know you have been we put full faith in our fearless leader.&nbsp; Godspeed good sir.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />STM

				Hmmmmmm....<br /><br />first we see stupid and obvious posts in the forum about the wonder of that Atlantis site and also separate ones about litecoin which IMO where attempts at viral marketing and where clearly &#039;sponsored&#039; in some way THEN, or at the same time rather, we see a DDOS attack on the road... interesting that the main points of criticism about SR in the posts was the speed of the road and how it crashes so much accompanied by a reassurance that Atlantis was quick and smooth as Amazon...... How convenient for them that a random attack started just in time to make their bulshit look like steak...<br /><br />Not saying that they did this.... but actually that&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m saying... yup just makes me even more sure that Atlantis and even Litecoins are being manufactured by either big banks, LE or organized crime like the OMC or mob of some description.. IMO they are all as corrupt and capable of all this as each other so.... Stay strong Roadsters.. This place is special and DPR is a unique and valuable person to have overseeing these first steps towards the world most of us desire and believe is achievable maybe even in our lifetimes if we do it right. <br /><br />I believe SR and DPR are our best chance to do it right and from the bottom of my heart I thank you Mr(Mrs/Miss?) Roberts and for what its worth; my life, although not perfect by any rate, is better for having found this place. I&#039;m safer, happier and in better health because of this service and to me... its priceless... I hope you know that mate... Your diligence and tenacity is both appreciated and admired, by myself and I imagine a large number of other people. <br /><br />I don&#039;t care how long it takes to get this fixed and so long as you are still in the fight I&#039;m not giving up on here or you. I believe in the both of you and will be here as long as it is around.<br /><br />Thank you so much for everything you do and have done...<br /><br />Peace, respect and best wishes,<br /><br />Sr user, forum abuser <br /><br />HellInaHandBasket <br />Aka<br />B*ndit*****id

				I&#039;ve been able to add listings, just no images. I did however think at first it wasn&#039;t&nbsp; working.<br /><br />I went to add new listing. Typed it all out. Hit go. Came up with some &#039;xml error page&#039; hit refresh and the new listing did come up under my &#039;current listings&#039; page<br /><br />I also went through the market and the listing exists.

Not $800 at x10 as your quoted text attempts to say.<br />And it&#039;s hilarious that CF&#039;s MDMA is literally 28g&#039;s for $800. If someone buys 1gx10 in your jacked up prices, that&#039;s only 10g for almost $900. <br /><br />100% positive feedback doesn&#039;t excuse being an asshole for flipping people&#039;s product so high. When I was an eager noob and only ordered domestic, I left pos feedback while rolling on my new product as well.<br /><br />But the world is full of assholes, users, and scammers. SR is no exclusion.<br /><br />If the suckers buy your MDMA, I guess they deserve it. <br />Once they take that plunge and cross customs, they&#039;ll wake up when they get that first bag of moonrock or brown sugar that is bulk and less than half the price of yours.<br /><br />I generally don&#039;t like to talk negatively about people unless they&#039;re being especially retarded or warranting it. But seriously, domestic flipper vendors crack me up, but make me sad at the same time. Same kind of fuckery that happens on craigslist. Scammers, shammers, and 1-up&#039;ers always taking advantage of anyone any chance they get.<br /><br />Meh. If you&#039;re a noob reading this, I would buy from this wo/mans sources if I were you. Canada to US is relatively safe except for LL&#039;s security incident a few weeks (couple months? time is flying.) ago.

I&#039;ve gotten it every time, and I have ordered some large weight across customs and stealth was absolutely amazing. 3 weeks ago they changed shit up and improved their stealth. MDMA tested well and exceeded even domestic whitewash I have gotten. <br /><br />Even so. I would still recommend to go with CF directly over buying from retards like Ceelo. Canada -&gt; US customs hasn&#039;t ever given me or friends a problem.

				What a battle.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nerd against script kitty.&nbsp; I think we might now have php5 installed or whatever. <br />There was an exploit that was there Obviously. It&#039;s been toyed with for the past while and he knows it.&nbsp; We all know it.&nbsp; The site was slow and slower still, then strange errors and error messages that told the world too much about how the site works.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />They waited until they were organized enough to exploit it finally, possibly for fee from another site.&nbsp; Hey who knows. It&#039;s speculation.&nbsp; <br /><br />No holds barred.&nbsp; Nice fight though.&nbsp; We are all more secure now because of it.&nbsp; Each time someone exploits the site, they teach us a lesson and get stronger as a result. If they were smart, they would&#039;ve kept it quiet and silently attacked at random for years . <br /><br />TuggingOnSupermans cape username was razzing DPR pretty bad in the threads, but they spoke some truth about the infrastructure being used here.&nbsp; &nbsp;At some point, you gotta replace the engine, even if its your baby.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to keep up to updates and shit these days. You fix one thing and it opens another hole elsewhere.&nbsp; You need testers and a chief of security or something on staff.&nbsp; &nbsp;Consult and cross consult.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nobody ever criticized a general for calling in the marines to help.&nbsp; It&#039;s what they do.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s going to get a lot tougher in the future to solve these exploits.&nbsp; <br /><br />. It&#039;s a shame we are working our boss to death, but at some point he is going to have to trust more people or else suffer a heart attack. No joke.&nbsp; If he gets sick, we are done. You gotta wonder why he is doing this to himself, but he&#039;s a true giver and the most kindest, fairest pirate that ever lived. <br /><br />Nice work.&nbsp; (Bows down)<br /><br />Hero as always.&nbsp;

For a person in your position, you need to take active steps to ensure you don&#039;t burnout. It&#039;s better to be at 100% 50% of the time, than at 50% 100% of the time in my opinion.<br /><br />Also, in a pinch vendors can upload images through Tor elsewhere and link them. Perhaps not ideal, but as an interim solution until any bugs are quashed.

It would&nbsp; be a silly move on LE&#039;s part to attack SR in this way. All shutting down SR would do would be to force people to disperse to rival markets. It would increase the proliferation of more SR-like sites, having the opposite result of what was intended. <br /><br />It&#039;s more likely a rival market, someone with a grudge, or blackmail.<br /><br />I&#039;m still convinced that SR will pull through this and emerge even stronger than before.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Does anything LE does make sense??<br />LE enabled all of us to do all sorts of silly drugs that you would never have done if they were legal. Making drugs illegal has had the opposite effect of what they are trying to accomplish but they continue to illegalize harmless drugs like pot or acid.. Not saying the <br />DDOSer is LE just pointing out a flaw in your logic..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good point Sofish. I made the mistake of thinking they were smart :)<br /><br />Whatever they try to do, won&#039;t work long-term. For every drug they ban, 5 new ones pop up. For every SR they bring down, 5 more will pop up. To quote Emerson: &quot;Nothing, not all the armies of the world, can stop an idea whose time has come&quot;. Viva la Evolution!
