				I like the way you keep this mystery alive -- we could have some fun with it. Why don&#039;t readers post some clues?

That&#039;s the good thing about Silk Road -- it provides great security for things like that. <br /><br />In the meantime, I&#039;m gonna say it loud and I&#039;m gonna say it proud: I CAN&#039;T FIND THE &quot;BECOME A SELLER&quot; LINK.

Riiiiight.<br /><br />Apart from none of the above making any sense whatsoever - though it would seem you are attempting to insult either myself, my moniker, or Graham Greene - you&#039;re not ready to be a Vendor on Silk Road as you cannot even find the &#039;Become a seller&#039; link. The most worrying part of all of this is that you&#039;re obviously looking for the Account link here on the forum, rather than on Silk Road itself.<br /><br />Shroomeister even told you EXACTLY where to look. This confirms my assumption that you&#039;re looking for it here on the forums, which implies that you&#039;re not exactly terribly tech-savvy, thus presenting further evidence that your customer&#039;s information would be terribly insecure, at best.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: BecurSansnow</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As for your &quot;dread to think how insecure your entire set-up would be, especially when it comes to protecting customer&#039;s information&quot;, I&#039;ll just sell from another account, so no one will be any the wiser. That&#039;s the good thing about Silk Road -- it provides great security for things like that. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Selling from another account so that no one knows it&#039;s you doesn&#039;t negate the fact that your set-up would be incredibly insecure. In fact it shows your blatant disregard for security, both your potential customer&#039;s and your own, and a willingness to utilise the anonymity inherent in Silk Road&#039;s set-up and TOR to simply flip an account when presented with problems or issues. This has been a technique used by scammers in the past who are coming back for scam # 2.<br /><br />Quite frankly, BecurSansnow, you represent a threat to the safety of any customer on Silk Road who may decide to buy from you once you have a Vendor account, though at this rate it looks entirely unlikely that that will ever happen.<br />They remain safe, for now!<br /><br />- grahamgreene
