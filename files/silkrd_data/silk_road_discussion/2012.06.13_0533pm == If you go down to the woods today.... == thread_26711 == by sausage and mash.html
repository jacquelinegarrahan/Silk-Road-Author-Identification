				Hello People,<br /><br />Im off with my friends for a weekend camping and exploring our local forest, what im looking for is some inspiration on what would make our trip more interesting, iv already ordered some shrooms and im praying to the forest gods that they arrive, this will see us through Friday/Saturday AM but im needing something for Saturday night, im not a big chemical lover but not a hippy ether so open to all suggestions. A friend has some mdma but this just doesn&#039;t sit right, mdma and loud music yes, spiritual enlightenment and trees no,<br />iv got some of jezails super hash to relax(saved before he/she/they sold out!), how about some opium tea?<br />Any help tips or suggestions are appreciated.<br />Thanks people

				^ Also psilocybin and acid. My first acid trip, I saw the trees practically come alive with the faces of animals and human beings! I remember the color of the night sky as time ticked on it grew from a dark bluish-green hue to a deep purple color. It was so fantastic I thought time had stopped just for me so I could enjoy all that was living and how science makes the physical world comprehensible. It was one of the most wonderful experiences I ever had, and to this day I love going outside in any weather being totally optimistic about it.

				25i-NBOMe, 2C-B, 2C-E, LSD, and Psilocybin are the best things imaginable for nature! Oh my gosh and it only gets better with weed! ;D

				Shrooms and nature go together like nothing else.<br /><br />Acid is good everywhere.<br /><br />I personally take MDMA spiritually and therapeutically more often than for fun with loud music. I wouldn&#039;t take just MDMA out in the woods, but I wouldn&#039;t be against adding it to shrooms or something.
