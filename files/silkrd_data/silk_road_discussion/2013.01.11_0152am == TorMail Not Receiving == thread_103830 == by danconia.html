			<dd class="postbody">
				Is anyone else having problems receiving emails in their TorMail account?&nbsp; For some reason it seems to be able to send emails out fine but is not receiving anything.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried sending test emails, etc.<br /><br />I sent some BTC via Coinapult so I am having trouble retrieving them now... I&#039;ve sent an email to both Coinapult and ZipZap (although in retrospect ZipZap probably can&#039;t do much about it).<br /><br />Edit: Nevermind it looks like the ZipZap slips were automatically put into my Junk folder.&nbsp; This still doesn&#039;t explain why my BitInstant / Coinapult email did not go through (the fact that the ZipZap payment went through means that my email was entered correctly).<br /><br />Is anyone else having this issue?

				sent an email to myself just now from outside of tormail.<br /><br />Technical details of permanent failure:<br />XXXX tried to deliver your message, but it was rejected by the recipient domain. We recommend contacting the other email provider for further information about the cause of this error. The error that the other server returned was: 550 550 Administrative prohibition (state 12).

				Okay I sent emails to both ZipZap and BitInstant.&nbsp; The ZipZap people were relatively quick to respond and made it clear that the problem was on BitInstant&#039;s side.&nbsp; They forwarded my message to &quot;Rachel or Charlie&quot; at BitInstant and this morning I got a response from &quot;Rachel&quot; giving me the link for my Coinapult retrieval of my BTC.<br /><br />My BTC are currently en-route to my SR address.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve had problems then try to figure out which leg of the transaction failed (ie MoneyGram, ZipZap, or BitInstant) and send them an email detailing the issue.&nbsp; Hopefully my issue will alert them that there might be a wider issue right now.<br /><br />Good luck!

				It&#039;s good to know that tormail is working again, I just checked my mail to see all the emails I had missed. I noticed this issue yesterday when I was trying to contact my BTC vendor, he was getting my emails but I could not receive his. Quite frustrating indeed!
