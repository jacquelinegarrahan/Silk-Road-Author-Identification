				Just surfing through the road i see that many vendors say you must leave 5/5 feedback or they will blacklist you or no longer sell to you. IMO this defeats the whole purpose of the rating system. I&#039;ve had better transaction with some vendors then others and would like my rating to appropriately reflect that, but I just have to leave 5/5 on everything for the fear of being blacklisted and never being able to order from that vendor again. i think this practice should be banned. Thoughts?&nbsp; ;D ;D

				I think that&#039;s what DPR is trying to do with the new ratings system. As it stands, it might as well be thumbs up or thumbs down.<br /><br />May take a while to get people to change their behavior and recalibrate their intuitive sense of what a rating means. Switching to the average out of 5 was a good step in that direction. Whether vendors accept a legitimate ratings system, as opposed to the bullshit one we had, remains to be seen.<br />

				Just go with the flow. Besides, you probably don&#039;t want to talk about &quot;banning&quot; things on a site where we&#039;re all gathered together to take refuge from things banned by various government authorities. <br /><br />Use the comment dialogue box to discuss the particulars of your order experience (without revealing anything sensitive like level of stealth, how far you are from vendor, packaging, shipping service... things like that avoid). Your comment is worth more than your score which will be factored out over time. If you hurt a vendor&#039;s rating, you can&#039;t honestly think they will take that as constructive criticism. But your comment is for the benefit of like-minded individuals. Individuals who take the time to read feedback comments to gauge a vendor. <br /><br />Think of this... Let&#039;s say a vendor gets attacked by rival vendors and buyers trying to scam them all of whom left a string of 1/5s which in turn lowered the vendors rating. But all other feedback is 5/5 and with comments which underscore that rating. Is that vendor&#039;s lowered rating actually reflective of the vendor&#039;s business? No. But if we just went by the score, we might think it was. But when reading the comments, we can see that those 1/5s are anomalous or nefarious. <br /><br />Well what do you think a 4/5 looks like in the midst of slew of 5/5s? Like a buyer with all the wrong expectations whose just being unnecessarily picky. And that&#039;s why vendors blackmail that buyer. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I hear what you&#039;re saying. And it doesn&#039;t help that DPR tried to denote what each rating level would represent. But think about it. What do you get for having left a 4/5? Even if a vendor doesn&#039;t blacklist you for having left it. Do you think he/she/they really wants to do business with you again? More to the point, do YOU want to do business with them again? Wouldn&#039;t that just be &quot;settling?&quot; As in you&#039;d do business with them only if there&#039;s no other better vendor around of has what you want in stock. And that&#039;s what leaving a 4/5 conveys to the vendor. You&#039;re &quot;insulting&quot; them. <br /><br />So there&#039;s really only 3 useable feedback scores. <br /><br />5/5 = thanks, I&#039;ll be back. <br />3/5 = Had some serious hassles, vendor gave me anxiety, but got my order or some or all of my money back but took am unexpectedly long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />1/5 = FUBAR. Happy to burn this bridge leading to the village of suckville whose inhabitants are all named after a Buncha Bumfuks. <br /><br />Lastly, always keep in mind that vendors are under no obligation to accept an order from anyone just as a buyer is under no obligation to buy from a vendor.&nbsp; So there&#039;s no way to ban vendors from making one agree to leave a 5/5 as a condition of sale. Even if you banned them from detailing that as a condition of sale, they can still opt to not do any further business with you and do not have to give a reason why when they cancel your order without notice. And when they cancel your order within 4 days of you placing it before marking as in transit, you can&#039;t leave feedback as that&#039;s how the feedback system is designed. <br /><br />So really, all things considered, what&#039;s the point of leaving a 4/5?&nbsp; What benefit is there that&#039;s worth far more than the possible detriment that can result from having left it? <br /><br />3/5... that a different story. Vendors pretty much know when to expect a 3/5. Same with 1/5s. <br /><br />Those 2/5s though, which are rarely used, are sometimes taken by a vendor as having dodged a worse bullet (1/5). <br /><br />Hope that helps to make heads and tails of it all.

If 4/5s don&#039;t have an impact on vendor ratings, vendors will not care much about them anymore. Under the old system, a 4/5 left by an active buyer on an expensive listing would take off some serious points from the vendor&#039;s rating. Now, with the new algorithm, it doesn&#039;t seem as if a 4/5 will cause an material damage regardless of who leaves it. <br /><br />But we&#039;ll see...

				Nobody forces anyone to leave 5/5.<br />I see the blacklist and people don&#039;t just get put on there easily.<br /><br />Often people leave 1/5 without any reason or without contacting the vendor.<br />Of they PM us saying they will leave a low rating unless they get some free drugs. <br />That is what most vendors mean by saying they will blacklist users who give low ratings.<br /><br />And yes, this happens a lot. The more addictive the drug, the worse the buyers are generally.<br />

				I require users to leave 5/5 for a couple of big reasons.<br />&nbsp;1) Since I only ship domestic USA, packages are literally never seized<br />&nbsp;2) Because I ship out on time priority mail packages are always received within 3-4 days.<br />&nbsp;3) I always sell no less than what my product is described as. <br /><br />With all of these important qualities of the transaction being met there is absolutely no reason a buyer should not leave a 5/5. If something is damaged in transit, I could understand, and compensate them. If something doesn&#039;t arrive to the USA, it is pretty much impossible unless a) somebody in their life snitched on them, or b) they fucked up their address, which isn&#039;t my fault.<br /><br />I establish these clear rules because I&#039;ve seen some pretty stupid ass buyers leave low feedback for stupid ass reasons. Don&#039;t even get me started. If a product arrives promptly and is no less than is described, then the vendor deserves a 5/5. Like really I&#039;ve seen somebody leave low feedback on a vendor selling mexican dirt weed, and his reason for the feedback was &quot;This weed is very weak&quot;. Well no fucking shit, you got exactly what you paid for per the description. Trust me, there are a lot of retards that make it onto this site.<br />

				<br />Hell_On_Heels, what is your buyer account name? I actually agree with a lot of your points, especially about being able to differentiate between average vendors and vendors who go over the top. I personally always through my orders overweight. Order 10 pills, just 10 usually. Get 20/30, easily I can throw in a few extra. Get a 100, I might throw in 15 extra. it just depends.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t agree with is leaving less than a 5/5. So with that, I think SR should add another option, a 6/5. They should have a specific choice for perfect transaction, everything went well(5/5) and a choice that says something like &quot;vendor went over the top, threw in extra, super fast customer service&quot;(6/5)<br /><br />To take it a step further they could add in a system to rate the vendor on specific qualities, such as customer service, response time, friendlyness, promptness, etc. These would be the best statistics that would give buyers a good view of vendors. They could even throw in a vendor stat option that shows the average processing time for each vendor.... that would also be great. I hate ordering from vendors and having it process for 5 days.

The feedback comment is more important and is permanent in terms of both impact and impression. However, the numerical rating you leave get&#039;s factored out over time and loses its value with regard to the vendor&#039;s overall numerical rating. Buyers can form a coalition where they all decide to leave 4/5 as the highest value they would ever give. But then that simply means that all vendors would be below a 5/5 rating. So that idea has no value in the long run. <br /><br />If you start creating a bunch of buyer accounts to try to evade the blacklists, you&#039;ll also have to create separate delivery drops for each one. There&#039;s lots of ways in which vendors can identify your submitted address without having to retain the actual address. One way is to use SHA1 hash of your address. I&#039;m not going to fully explain how it works. There&#039;s also stylometrics which can be used to figure out who left what review and associated rating. Just illustrating a point that the harder you try to evade the blacklists, the more clever vendors will become in defeating your efforts. <br /><br />The smart buyer realizes that leaving a 5/5 is the smart thing to do under most circumstances and uses the comment section to voice any concerns or slight dissatisfaction. You are after all at a disadvantage in that you are giving an address to an unknown anonymous party. Plus the smart buyer also realizes that some vendors have multiple accounts and may also share information with vendors they&#039;ve allied with. So doing harm to one vendor and vowing to never do business with them again is a false assumption as you might be doing business with the same vendor, only a different name. <br /><br />Just ask yourself what do you gain for leaving a 4/5 relative to the risk of having done so? Do you honestly think the &quot;community benefits&quot; from your 4/5 rating? A community where more than 70% do not even encrypt their address and in which many voluntarily FE in spite of the many warnings not to? <br /><br />If you go through all the trouble of encrypting your address*, making sure your clearnet activities cannot be associated with darknet activities and you&#039;re careful about how you go about obtaining and moving Bitcoins into SR, why would you think to defeat all that by taking a chance on making a vendor remember you in a negative way by leaving a 4/5 over something trivial? You&#039;re defeating all your best efforts for no good reason at all. <br /><br />Remember, in life, just because you *can* do something, doesn&#039;t mean you should. <br /><br />*at some point your encrypted PGP message containing your address has to be decrypted. Never, ever assume that 100% of vendors delete this information. Rather, assume that all keep your name and address and then act accordingly in light of this assumption. Vendors have many reasons and motivations to keep address information. In fact, some proof of this can be found by asking people who had reships if the vendor asked them for their address again. Many will report that they weren&#039;t asked for their address again for the purpose of a reship yet the reship arrived.&nbsp; <br /><br />Things that make you go hmmm....

				Vendors are under no obligation to deal with any customers. My personal standard is that I expect a buyer to talk to me prior to leaving negative feedback. If a customer leaves negative feedback without letting me even know there is a problem, I don&#039;t need that kind of customer and I will deny further purchases.

I don&#039;t expect people to leave 5/5 if something goes wrong and they are not happy.<br />However in nearly every case, nothing goes wrong so I do expect buyers to lave 5/5, because that is what I deserve.<br /><br />If a buyer is to leave anything other than a 5/5, I it is only fair they contact me first so we can sort out anything they are not happy with (within reason).<br />But leaving 4/5 because everything was fine, but not &quot;exceptional&quot; is pretty unfair.<br /><br />Remember if vendors are not happy here, they will pack up and go. Sell IRL or even on another site.<br />

If something is damaged in transit, I could understand, and compensate them. If something doesn&#039;t arrive to the USA, it is pretty much impossible unless a) somebody in their life snitched on them, or b) they fucked up their address, which isn&#039;t my fault.<br /><br />I establish these clear rules because I&#039;ve seen some pretty stupid ass buyers leave low feedback for stupid ass reasons. Don&#039;t even get me started. If a product arrives promptly and is no less than is described, then the vendor deserves a 5/5. Like really I&#039;ve seen somebody leave low feedback on a vendor selling mexican dirt weed, and his reason for the feedback was &quot;This weed is very weak&quot;. Well no fucking shit, you got exactly what you paid for per the description. Trust me, there are a lot of retards that make it onto this site.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And that makes a good and consistent vendor!&nbsp; How do we differentiate from you and one who goes WAY the hell out the way? Threw in freebies, shipped express when it&#039;s not offered, or thank your notes for ordering and notices on the day you should receive the package since vendors no longer give out tracking numbers for the most part.<br /><br />Out do I filter you out for those? If I&#039;m supposed to read through the comments, then why do we have a feedback score anyways?<br /><br />I&#039;ve pretty much said my part on this. I WILL NOT be leaving a 5/5 for a transactions with out issues. That will be a 4/5. If you choose to blacklist me then that is your choice. My buyer account is fairly high stats. I&#039;ll go somewhere else. Also, expect delays in my feedback. I will not place feedback until I try the product. If it says HQ, I want HQ.<br /><br />Thank GOD that I can still finalize without leaving feedback immediately.&nbsp; I would hate to try to count days until I can try product so I don&#039;t hold vendors funds back.<br /><br />One more thing. I don&#039;t care if you have been on the road for 5 years with +12000 positive transactions with all 5/5. I will never finalize early. Never. You want to point out all your good stats and sales, I&#039;ll point to Thurgoods. He had great stats too. As have had many before you that went done that rode. With SR allowing sales of vendor&#039;s account I can&#039;t even be sure that it is actually you that built those stats.&nbsp; You can have the best coke, MDMA, DMT in the world for less than half of current market value. I&#039;ll go buy the stepped-on, double priced, product from a vendor in escrow.<br /><br />IN FACT, I&#039;m not even sure why I have been directing my comments at Vendors or Admins.<br /><br />Consumers are the power in the free-market. If, as consumers, we REFUSE to FE for anybody ever again, they will change their policy. If we just start leaving whatever we feel is appropriate for feedback, what the hell they gonna do? Blacklist they&#039;re whole customer base?&nbsp; Things can only get better for US the consumers if we stick to our CONSUMER POLICY.<br /><br />NEVER FE<br /><br />I&#039;LL LEAVE WHAT I WANT FOR FEEDBACK.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to start creating and building up several accounts tonight because I see in my future many blacklist. No problem. If I like your product and service and gave you a 4/5 and you ban me, I&#039;ll just order again from one of the others. Won&#039;t leave vengeful feedback but I will leave honest feedback again.<br /><br />And again.<br /><br />And again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />you make a big mistake....you say: consumers are the power in the free market?<br />Vendors are -by nature- careful who they sell to.<br />If I get a message better watch out for buyer X I will certainly do that.<br />The moment I will see a order from you I will see/check what your problem-s- were.<br />I will easily cancel your order because...I don&#039;t want trouble in the broadest sense.<br />I don&#039;t need your 4/5 feedback as you just stated when I give you excellent&nbsp; service and you don&#039;t think its enough....that way bring down my well deserved rating (5/5 is there for a reason)<br />So as you already started other accounts you KNOW...that what you are doing is wrong and not appreciated by vendors.<br />If you know vendors will blacklist you maybe it is a sign that YOU not thinking in the right terms here.<br /><br />A consumers market, power to the consumers.<br /><br />Okay. you have no power at all...tell you why.<br />You NEED what you order, often you need it badly. For whatever reason you need it.<br />The moment you are depended on something, whatever it is you have no power anymore. <br />The contrary actually, it has power over you.<br /><br />Now the vendor.<br /><br />Sits at home, has a lot of items and put them on SR<br />He do not need to do anything, he just WANT to sell.....<br />So far pretty relaxed.<br />There are the orders...money is coming in, working cool this way...<br />He has lots of orders and then one...hey...thats XX...hit the cancel button.<br />So...for him what happened? Nothing, just a potential 4/5 or less not able to ruin his rating.<br />But give a message to his colleague &#039;&#039;hey...careful...X is trying again&#039;&#039;<br />And so, slowly but surely your buyer name-s- are diminishing and you end up with a problem.<br />Because of what was just sketched the vendor sit there still a happy camper and you....ouch...you need it bad now...really bad.<br />You look at the account you ordered from...it is still not in progress, maybe, maybe.... and after 2 or 3 days it is canceled..again.<br />Now panic start...Okay, Atlantis, I am new there, they don&#039;t know me...yes you are right !! GO GO...<br />oops ...the same vendor on SR also has an account on Atlantis.<br /><br />If I were you, I would start an honest raring system going with what is considered fair here on SR...not in you own little mind.<br /><br />For people who want to read the whole book go to Amazon.c.....LOL <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
