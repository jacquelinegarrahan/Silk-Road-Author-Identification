				I just read we were accepting new members. I agree everyone should be granted equal opportunities and have access.. but due to recent growing pains or other reasons, being unknown.<br /><br />&nbsp;Is this a good thing? We can barely get logged on now. My point is.. that we do not have proper best practice policies for new admissions in place to access SR, and those policies should be defined and presented to the SR community. This isn&#039;t hippy shit where we say.. ohh it&#039;s cool&nbsp; <br /><br />NO. I dislike being the voice of the furious few but I&#039;m getting dismayed and want to clearly have SR define our future.<br /><br />Think about it.. Euro&#039;s call the US a bunch on wanks that bring the site down the US customer&#039;s say those d-bags overseas are too busy smoking fags and eroding bandwith.<br /><br />full disclosure - I&#039;m a seller on SR &amp; located in the US so I do not benefit from curtailing new accounts.. but imo is the right thing to due&nbsp; (curtailing new accounts) also -&nbsp; as the traffic has enforced time-outs and disconnects need to occur window shopping days sort term are over.<br /><br />Does anyone else feel that open enrollment is is a poor decision? Due to the instability?&nbsp; Remember September 2012 no worries log in .. log out no delays? more member is a&nbsp; show stopper - we can&#039;t handle the traffic thru load balancing or other techniques....presently <br /><br />I&#039;m not bashing rather looking for rational answers in this decision.<br /><br />ce<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Better to have a fully functioning site, than one overloaded. Until upgrades are fully implemented I vote for no new members.
