				When you get a package but need a few days before you can test it to confirm the advertised potency, do you finalize anyways because you&#039;ve received it, tell the vendor you received it, or wait until after you test it before saying anything?

				If I buy some personal stash at the weekend and my gear arrives mid-week, I&#039;m not getting high on a work night and it would be unfair for me to hold the money until the weekend when I sample it (that shit wouldn&#039;t fly on the street), so I&#039;ll finalize upon arrival to keep my dealer sweet.<br /><br />If you&#039;re ordering a fuckton of product then that&#039;s business and you should not only protect your business interests by sampling the product before finalizing, but do that as quickly as possible like a professional.

				If there is some sort of quick test that can be performed to validate that the chemical is what was advertized (MDMA, Ketamine, Opiates, etc) I will usually verify that the test checks out and finalize within 24-48 hours. Generally as soon as I receive it, but there are some times when I am not able to get to the destination the day that the package arrives.<br /><br />Generally it&#039;s the responsibility of the vendor to get you the product. This said, that constitutes grounds for finalizing. Now if the vendor sent product that was inadequate for some reason (See Nomad&#039;s example) then that should be something you take up with that vendor to see what they can do to help correct the issue. If a LOT of users are seeing the same thing it will be very likely that it will show up in the forums and the vendor will either correct it, or just completely bail out.<br /><br />I just try to use reasonably good vendors and extend them whatever courtesies I can to ensure a smooth transaction, if after that they do a crappy job I simply move on to another vendor, if it&#039;s bad enough I may comment in their review thread, or start another thread to warn other users of their service/product/practices.

				If I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to test or sample a product for a few days then I finalize when I receive it. I figure I&#039;ve done some research on the vendor ahead of time, and I can always leave a 1/5 review if the product is bunk. Haven&#039;t had a problem yet.
