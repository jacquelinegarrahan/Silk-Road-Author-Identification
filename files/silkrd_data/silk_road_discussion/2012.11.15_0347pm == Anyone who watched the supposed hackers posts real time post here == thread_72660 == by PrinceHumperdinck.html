				Sorry if other don&#039;t share my opinion but I do not really believe a conventional DDoS attack is possible over Tor.<br />I suppose you could point a botnet at the site and hit it with masses of bandwidth but to what end?<br />People are suggesting BMR are part of some conspiracy to keep the road down, I dont think so.<br />Look how active the Forums currently are with traffic and double that figure, I think server load but I could well be wrong.

				Hi,<br /><br />so Denial Of Service is typically a hacker strategy to paralyze a server by overloading his capacity to answer to demands.<br /><br />You can imagine a phone service, with a limited numbers of entering connections, ask so many people to call the phone service continuously with fake demands and you will simply paralyze it and the real people who need the service won&#039;t be able to reach it.<br /><br />As explained on another thread a classical DDOS is not possible on Tor cause of the characteristics of the Tor network.<br /><br />but a DOS is possible and not very hard to set up with &quot;slowloris&quot; type attacks for example.<br /><br />So yes it is possible for an average hacker to do this but again like on the other threads you have to keep in mind that nothing is confirmed for the moment so nothing is sure until the Admins and DPR enlightened us on the real situation.

				Hi,<br /><br />Slowloris is about sending incomplete requests to a server so it is kind of special compare to classical DDOS attacks, servers are very hard to protect from this and almost every OS are affected more or less by it.<br /><br />The thing is, as the requests made to the server are incomplete there are no classical mean for the server to manage them and have a normal comportment.<br /><br />The only thing against these attacks is to put a control of the requests before the server to verify if the requests are complete or incomplete and filtrate.<br /><br />Again these are suppositions until something is confirmed by the Admins and DPR...<br /><br />The simple overloading of the server seems anyway not plausible for the moment, some people would have accessed SR until now, a big technical problem with the server is possible but the fact that sometimes you can acces the login page but with an anormal Captcha does not plead for that...

You can also set up reverse proxies, firewalls, load balancers or content switches.<br /><br />SR Admins could also change the affected web server to software that is unaffected by this form of attack. <br /><br />SR should be aware of this and take the necessary steps to protect themselves and SR users, there is too much money involved to leave it to chance...

				Hi,<br /><br />@ PrinceHumperdinck : you are right if you consider a normal server, the fact that SR server is on the Tor Network does not give you all these possibilities to counter a Slowloris DOS attack...Tor has specifications that are different compare to the normal Network.<br /><br />Does the forum provide any financial benefit where a DOS could lead to loss of money? why the fuck would someone would DOS the forum, it is not supporting any business directly so it can be down without leading to loose money for anyone on short term so people won&#039;t really care as much as the SR main site if the forum is down...Here is probably the answer...

				At this point, it seems like a DoS attack --likely part of some dickhead extortion attempt -- rather than a direct site break in. Open tor circuits to SR that hang there support this conclusion.
