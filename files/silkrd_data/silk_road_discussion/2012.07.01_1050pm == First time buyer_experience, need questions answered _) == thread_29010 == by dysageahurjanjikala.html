				Hey there,<br /><br />So I&#039;m looking at getting some psilocybin on SR but need to ask a few questions first<br /><br />1) I heard some people talk about signing for packages when they arrive, and that this is a bad thing? Someone said it&#039;s better to take the loss than jail time... what&#039;s behind this?<br /><br />2) Realistically, and just out of curiosity, in the UK, what&#039;s the likely scenario if one was caught having 5g cubensis delivered to his/her house?<br /><br />3) I&#039;m pretty out of the loop concerning encrypting address etc... I need some good pointers and an easy tutorial for a one off purchase. Can any fellow SR browsers help me out? I want it to be as smooth as possible - place an order, pay the bitcoins, leave a small message to the seller and encrypt my information.<br /><br />4) How long does it usually take for a package to arrive? I know this is a question reliant on a lot of variables, such as country of origin, address of recipient etc., but is 3 days unrealistic to wait, ordering from, say, the Netherlands?<br /><br />I have a few more questions, but I can&#039;t remember them at this time... these are the most important anyway. Thanks so much in advance.<br /><br />Also, apologies if this is found in the wrong section of the forum/the answers are obvious. Like I say, I&#039;m new and just want a smooth, one off transaction.<br /><br />

				Signing for a package doesn&#039;t mean you know what&#039;s inside, but some people don&#039;t like it anyway.<br />In the UK the likely scenario of having 5g cubensis intercepted by customs is that it would be destroyed and you probably won&#039;t get a letter because they usually save them for taxable contraband or larger amounts. It normally takes a few interceptions before you get a knock on the door and a stern talking to.<br />The security thread has a good tutorial.<br />Delivery times vary a lot, 3-5 working days is normal for EU to UK, but remember that some vendors mark In Transit before actually shipping so allow a bit longer.

The getting caught side of things is extremely positive. I mean, I&#039;d have to be insanely unlucky to get this kind of package intercepted though, right? Difficult to detect/sniff out/not a large amount/not worth their time etc. etc.<br />Still concerned about signing - like you say, how would I know what&#039;s inside the package? *wink wink* Yet I&#039;m still a little bothered about having any part of the &#039;real world&#039; me associated with the process, if you get me.
