				Institute a forum only account for the first 1-3 days after you register. I am a new member, and the first thing i did was research. Learned about pgp, gpg, what to do when you receive a package etc. Now it&#039;s common sense for most of us to go through a research phase when registering, but obviously that won&#039;t be the case for everyone. I say make it mandatory. That way we can stamp out idiocy. Who&#039;s with me?

				I partially agree, but I still believe that in order to Post you should pay something. Let&#039;s say 0.1 BTC one time payment. That would weed out the spammers. I did realize there might be a problem implementing this: it&#039;s so damn hard to get BitCoins. I actually made a lot of posts in the past few days just to realize from where the hell I can buy them :D. After I signed up, I spent about a day reading. But after that, the questions started to pop in my mind. So I guess 1 day should be enough.

				Yes, but as I said, the only problem is that getting BitCoins is a bit difficult. Look at my post count. Most of these posts I did just trying to get my hands on BitCoins. And I still haven&#039;t! <br /><br />Granted... I could instead use the BitCoinTalk Forums, not the SR Forums. But I found about the BitCoinTalk Forums *HERE* on the SR Forums :D. After posting.

The address they are sent to might be monitored for one reason or another, as many people use the free bitcoin sites.&nbsp; bitcoin is as anonymous as tor, its just you have to manually hand off the connection to remain anonymous. At least as far as i understand it.<br /><br />Bitcoin&#039;s can be purchased with regular money, you just have to be careful with the trace of the coins. wash it a few times, and you should be clean. Always maintain as much anonymity as possible, these are highly illegal substances, put as much distance between a trail of the money and you as possible<br />

				We&#039;re stealing the topic guys :).<br /><br />Anyway, I can&#039;t refrain from making one comment about our BitCoin purchasing side-discussion:<br /><br />@dbz4u: you can&#039;t purchase from MtGox except via various weird alternatives which are hardly accessible to me because I&#039;m from Europe. The usual alternatives such as bank transfer aren&#039;t available unless I get a verified account, and I&#039;m reluctant to do that.<br /><br />@drugfather: problem is: I&#039;m from Europe and I can&#039;t access most of those services. If memory serves, Dwolla is USA-only.

Think of it as laundering it. The reason you wash the money is because you only have the moment of transfer of these bitcoins. The address they are sent to might be monitored for one reason or another, as many people use the free bitcoin sites.&nbsp; bitcoin is as anonymous as tor, its just you have to manually hand off the connection to remain anonymous. At least as far as i understand it.<br /><br />Bitcoin&#039;s can be purchased with regular money, you just have to be careful with the trace of the coins. wash it a few times, and you should be clean. Always maintain as much anonymity as possible, these are highly illegal substances, put as much distance between a trail of the money and you as possible<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The best way is dwolla but now they require a 30 day hold to use funds for bitcoin for first time accounts. The easiest as of recent was cash deposits at banks&nbsp; (bitinstant.com) but the has gone to the hole. Moneypak exchangers charge an arm and a leg (15%-30% fee). I believe if dwolla wasn&#039;t getting most their traffic because of bitcoin they would have already suspended any transaction involving bitcoins.
