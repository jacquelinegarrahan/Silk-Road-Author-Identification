				Hi, I left something about this over on the H vendor forum, but was hoping to maybe get an answer here also. I am new to SR and after doing a lot of hanging around for a couple weeks placed my first order with dolfan2500 last night. I sent him a message telling him I would finalize early as that&#039;s what it seems like people who are new do with trusted sellers.&nbsp; The order was in processing all day yesterday and today when I go to check I have a message from SR Support saying Dolfan has canceled my order we are sorry. On top of that the bitcoins are back in my account, but about 30 cents lower than what i originally put in for the order. I was just wondering if anyone could answer as to why my order was canceled? I tried messaging Dolfan again but still no explanation or even answer at all from him. Maybe he is out? Or is having trouble? Or does he just not like me for some reason? Anyway im aware I probably sound pretty newb at this so I will shut up now ha, Thanks.

				I can&#039;t say why the order was canceled, but you probably got back fewer bitcoins because the value of bitcoin went up.&nbsp; The order was hedged, and thus, you get back the actual value you paid (what it was worth in US dollars, for example), instead of just getting the same quantity of bitcoins.

				I can&#039;t say why the order was cancelled either, but I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much.&nbsp; If you order things on Amazon or eBay, you know sellers sometimes making listings incorrectly or run out of stock on items prematurely.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the answers guys. Turns out since I am so new he was hesitant which I completely understand. Hopefully I can find some vendors who are willing to take a chance on someone so new. I have a couple orders in processing so well see what happens and I will keep my fingers crossed. Is there anything more I can do to reassure a seller I am legit? I have sent a message and offered to finalize early, but I don&#039;t know what else to do. Thanks.

I&#039;m sure you know that sellers are given limited information about your transaction history here on SR to determine if they&#039;d like to do business with you or not. They can see how many purchases you&#039;ve made, the dollar amount you&#039;ve spent, number of refunds you&#039;ve received etc. Check your Purchasing Stats under the account tab; you want to keep these stats as PERFECT as possible. This means 0% refunds, 0% auto-finalize, and a high number of transactions. If you don&#039;t have many transactions, but have spent a few thousand dollars between those transactions, that can also help assure a seller you&#039;re legit.<br /><br />That&#039;s the biggest part.&nbsp; There&#039;s more to it than that though.<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t give a vendor any reason to think you&#039;re sketchy. No unnecessary questions. Do not ask for details of any sort. Encrypt messages and sensitive info. Be patient and polite, but stick to the point and be as brief as possible with everything. Use your head here and act in a manner that keeps all involved parties anonymous and safe.<br /><br /><br />Welcome to the Road
