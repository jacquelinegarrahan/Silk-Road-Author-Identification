				Something I purchased required a FE. Ever since then (Almost 2 weeks now) I have not received anything and the user is not messaging me anything. Is there nothing I can do? Am I screwed? Thanks in advanced.

				Nothing that can be purchased on SR requires a buyer to FE. It&#039;s a choice you or a vendor makes which IMO, defies comprehension. Why risk your hard earned to an anonymous vendor where if something goes wrong, your screwed!! Never ever FE for any vendor, regardless of how good the deal may seem. Unfortunately for you, there is nothing SR can do for you. They can only help if you had gone to the Resolution Center and submitted a resolution proposal. Who is the vendor in question? Naming them could potentially save other buyers from making the same mistake. Sorry if I sound harsh, but there are still countless buyers prepared to FE for vendors and risk losing their coin. Why take the risk? It&#039;s a personal choice, I know, however many buyers soon return to the forum to post their stories of getting scammed by a &quot;trusted vendor&quot;.&nbsp;

				SR has an escrow system for a reason....Go to the scam thread tell everyone that he scammed you then go to your SR buyer account click &quot;Account&quot; at the top of the page then click on &quot;view feedback&quot; on the right side of the page,go to the review that you left when you finalized early and click &quot;Edit&quot;,give him a 1 out of 5 and let everyone know that you finalized early and that he still hasn&#039;t delivered after 2 weeks, and he is ignoring your messages.That should fuck his sells up pretty good and hopefully he will send it in hopes that you will give him a better review so customers wont be scared away if not at least you will probably prevent people from getting scammed.

				Thanks guys. I&#039;m doing just that, edited the feedback and I&#039;ll go over to the scam group and post about it. The seller in question is: djpyrex. And I realize that when you FE there is always that risk but still being kind of new with low purchasing history, that is the only option. Thanks again!!

				I know that all the regulars here will tell you &quot;never FE&quot;. But I know what it&#039;s like to be a new buyer here, It wasn&#039;t that long ago that I had no choice for most of the products I was looking for. What I did was only work with vendors who had 100% or near 100% ratings with hundreds of transactions. I also kept the transactions relatively small to an amount that I might lose at a blackjack table or slot machine. <br /><br />there are some vendors that don&#039;t require FE from new buyers, but not many! It seems there was a bunch of scammers on the buying side who claimed to never get product or never finalized.

				Good to hear. Thankfully it was a 1BTC purchase, so I guess I&#039;ll count my loses and move on. Thanks everyone for the replies!

				I&#039;m glad it was only 1 BTC. That&#039;s at the far end of the bell curve of losses to FE. <br /><br />I also noticed that some vendors now also require that buyers have a certain number of transactions with a minimum total spent. I guess that&#039;s to weed out the buyers who buy books or porn for a fraction of a BTC. But still, it&#039;s making it harder for new buyers. <br /><br />Might eventually need to open up a guarantee service for new buyers. Where SR starts guarantee accounts where a buyer deposits a certain amount but can only order 1/2 of the amount in their account. Sellers would have to submit a DCN to SR and the buyer would have to submit their town/state to SR so SR can match the DCN with what the buyer submits. This will prevent junk sellers from submitting false DCNs. The new buyer would pay a small one time fee for this service. <br /><br />It could be used for new buyers as well as large orders.

Once that&#039;s done and your happy with the way things went, I would then make some small purchases from local vendors. Again once that has been successfully completed and your&nbsp; beginning to gain a little confidence, you would be close to or even at a stage where your stats would enable you to not have to FE for any vendor world wide. We all had to start somewhere but IMO, it&#039;s just simply a matter of initially testing the water so to speak, and before you know it you&#039;ll have a better understanding of how things work. Your confidence in the way things work here on SR will grow the more you take the time to educate yourself on being safe and remaining anonymous. :)

				Silk Road shouldn&#039;t need to implement ANYTHING when it comes to protecting people from finalizing early - it&#039;s a system in place to protect vendors from being scammed and it is only a very small amount of vendors who will scam people using it.<br /><br />Situations like this shouldn&#039;t cause new buyers to become scared of vendors, it should just help them become more careful in their shopping choices, to look out for vendors who have a successful feedback result from FE&#039;s.<br /><br />Also, posting on how to &quot;bypass&quot; the purchase limit doesn&#039;t help, because there is a MUCH higher margin of scamming new buyers than scamming vendors.<br /><br />Long story short, don&#039;t let it get you down, there are some great vendors out there, and to prove it to you, if you&#039;re interested in a free gram of MXE, PM me your address and I&#039;ll get one out to you - as a sorry from all the vendors who care about the customers and would never rip you off :)

				Search djpyrex on the forums. He was a scammer and got his account closed. Took 10 BTC for me to learn not to FE. If a vendor requires a user to FE, just move on. Just not worth it. Too much risk on your part. Don&#039;t let your desire get the best of you.
