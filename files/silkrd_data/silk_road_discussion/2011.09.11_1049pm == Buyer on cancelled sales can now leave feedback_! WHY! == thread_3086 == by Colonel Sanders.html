				So, I just noticed, unless it is a glitch, something extremely disturbing.<br /><br />I had a buyer last month who claimed non-receipt of shipment even though the Delivery Confirmation indicated it had been delivered.&nbsp; It was a relatively small order and I did not want to deal with the risk of bad feedback by disputing it, so I simply canceled the order so that the buyer would get his Bitcoins back in full.&nbsp; I suspect I was simply getting ripped off, but it just wasn&#039;t worth the headache and canceling the order was the only real way to protect myself from a scamming buyer who might have to stick to his story to get a refund.<br /><br />NOW...&nbsp; Now I see that I have feedback from this buyer for that transaction.&nbsp; Thankfully, the guy left 5/5 because I refunded him, but WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?<br /><br />Why on EARTH are we going to have feedback on canceled sales?&nbsp; How is that possibly a good idea?&nbsp; Feedback is for speed of shipment, product, transaction quality--if the transaction is canceled, THERE&#039;S NOTHING TO RATE.<br /><br />Not to mention, that it removes the one big protection sellers had against getting smeared by an unscrupulous buyer.<br /><br />Make a special statistic that shows the amount of orders canceled by sellers if you must, but allowing buyers feedback on canceled orders is pure madness AND only serves to make feedback less meaningful.&nbsp; Please reconsider this change.

				i would have to agree. A seller should be able to cancel a sale. Since a transaction didn&#039;t happen, then how can anyone get rated.. Boy, I don&#039;t like that at all....

				You know what the result of this will be, sellers?&nbsp; Now, not only are you going to have to cancel orders where product was claimed non-receipt so that the buyer gets his money back, but you&#039;ll have to go the extra mile to keep your scamming buyers happy now!&nbsp; Maybe you&#039;ll have to reship that supposedly non-received product just to avoid bad feedback.<br /><br />Either that, or get ready to fight EVERY single one of these in resolution.&nbsp; Either way, this really ties sellers hands.

				That is how system really works. Option is in fact -reason what you select.<br />But I do not know what explanation comes to buyer in any of this..

				I&#039;m uneven about this. In fact I&#039;m just going to say I&#039;m unevenly leaning against the &#039;No&#039; area.<br /><br />1. could be good for sellers so they can be given feedback (good feedback) even if an order&#039;s cancelled, and continue biz at their discretion.<br /><br />2. could be bad for sellers, as they are opened to 2x the body slamming they already get by people leaving dick feedback. buyers can easily dent feedback two times as easily now.<br /><br />we have already imposed buyer stats, which is immensely helpful. that&#039;s where it should stop.<br /><br />i say no, in favor of seller integrity and limiting buyer manipulation of the situation...because believe you me - this is a rampant problem.<br /><br />peace and hair grease<br /><br />ï£¿L75
