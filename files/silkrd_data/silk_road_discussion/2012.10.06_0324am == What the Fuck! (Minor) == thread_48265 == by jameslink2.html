				I had a minor message me and tell me he is a minor and want to know how he can grow mushrooms without his mom finding out&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I tell him I will not sell to a minor and he does not seem to understand why.&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />To all the minors out there, grow up! Maybe some of the other vendors will knowingly sell to a minor but I wont. So if you are a minor don&#039;t fucking tell me and especially don&#039;t ask me how you can grow drugs with out your mom finding out.<br /><br />Sorry, just needed to vent a little.

Without mentioning being a minor, also, you can mark me off as a minor, so you don&#039;t sell to me. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m smart enough to grow lol.

				I do a lot of things that arnt exactly legal but I still follow my own set of rules and I don’t sell out my ethics. I don’t mind hustling and getting mine but I avoid high school kids and as a general rule avoid putting drugs into the hands of people that&nbsp; do serve kids. In my younger days I would serve a mom with kids but now adays I avoid that also. The sad part is that if drugs were legal and prohibition was ended it would empower the kids by providing more accurate knowledge. They have dispensaries everywhere in the big cities in California but you don’t see them handing weed out to kids. If drugs were legal business then instead of drug dealers making individual choices about minors it would be legitimate businessmen with a lot at stake.

				If I could give JamesLink a +1 I would. <br /><br />Yeah kids are going to get dope and do it, but for myself, my conscience would bother me if I were the one to give it directly to them. They&#039;ll have all the time in the world to get stoned after they&#039;re adults and by then they&#039;ll hopefully be responsible enough to make clear choices about what they&#039;ll put in their body.<br /><br />And about the reporter speculation - I wouldn&#039;t doubt it in the least. If not a reporter, then a shit disturber who would take this public and exclaim how evil SR is. In my daily observations, often journalists start with a preconceived idea and then set out to &#039;report&#039; on it. Let&#039;s not play into those games.

MINORS .. get the fuck off .. wait til you&#039;re 18 at least. for the sake of your PUBERTY. you&#039;tr dtunting your growth with all kinds of POISON consumed .. just go out there and master the art of masturbation .. keep your thoughts in school and stay the fuck off SR. never admit you&#039;re a minor, obviously .. that is plain STUPID. <br />stick with the weed, and MAYBE shrooms but take this whole thing lightly.<br />don&#039;t selfishly ruin it for the rest of the responsible ADULTS trying to get high in peace. if you&#039;re going to SR, at least put the effort to hide your browser activity and keep yourself safe not only from LE (law authority) but your fucking parents who would ASSKNEE your face into brick walls if you get caught. or keep you grounded from playing Call of Duty for 4 months.

I completely agree with this but physiologically the rate that your neurons undergo nueroplasticity declines at a exponential rate as you get older. This &quot;25&quot; age that people seem to harp on is just an estimated number there isn&#039;t much evidence behind it but it seems to be commonly accepted in the psychological community. I would also say that most minors aren&#039;t mature until around age 18 even behaviorally but I am like you and feel that I have had this same sense of maturity since I was pretty young. It&#039;s probably just because I never had much of a family to rely on mostly just myself.

Just a thought, though: Has anyone really &quot;grown up&quot; that much from their teenage years? Personally I still feel like the same person. I don&#039;t know if it should be as simple as saying someone is a kid and therefore cannot do drugs because this and that will occur, or because they&#039;re not able to make proper decisions. I don&#039;t know how or when you are supposed to start making decisions properly. You just get older and do things differently. Another &quot;this&quot; and a different &quot;that&quot; will occur if you indulge in drugs during adulthood. The assumption here is that, generally, all minors are unintelligent, vulnerable, and guiltless. I am a weak, stupid, impressionable young adult when I&#039;m 17 and eight months but then I&#039;m a well-learned, responsible adult able to make my own decisions on my eighteenth birthday? Seems a bit naive to think so.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, there are many ways in which I still feel like a kid, but in addition to what flicky42 says about the developing physical changes that happen in young people, there&#039;s the maturity factor to consider. Most 13 yr old kids I know (I am a parent) just don&#039;t have the world experiences under their belt to put things into perspective. I believe that drugs can be used responsibly for recreation by most adults. I also believe that they could possibly be used responsibly by some kids, but with many caveats like known dosages, a stable environment, and non-threatening peers. Even then I&#039;m talking only about weed or cannaboids. I don&#039;t think that drugs are &#039;good&#039; for your body (not talking about mental, social or physiological benefits) so my opinion is just to let kids be kids and have their own hormones mess them up until they&#039;re older. <br /><br />HardHustle is right when he says that when your 17 and 11 months, you don&#039;t somehow magically turn 18 and your good to go. But for better or worse this is the line in the sand that&#039;s drawn and I personally am glad there is some line.

				This is just as that stupid age restriction on video games. When I was 12 to 18 I enjoyed it the most. Now at that age you would not even be able to buy GTA or Battlefield in a shop. Also the Maryjane made my high-school year somewhat more bearable. The brainwashing institute, and bore you with uninteresting facts, of which most I forgot a day later. If it doesn&#039;t interest me it&#039;s not for me, I naturally resist it. Also Amphetamine and MDMA made my rave parties kick ass!!!
