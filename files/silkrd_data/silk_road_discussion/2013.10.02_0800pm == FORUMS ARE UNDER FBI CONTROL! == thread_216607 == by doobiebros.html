				Agreed - it is a strong possibility.<br /><br />Assume they are - do not be tempted to use the PM function to send sensitive info such as backup contact details unless they are PGP encrypted. No phone numbers or clearnet mail addresses unless they cannot possibly be linked to you and you access them only over TOR.<br /><br />if the feds want to run the forums then let them&nbsp; - just don&#039;t become a victim.<br /><br />ENSURE JAVASCRIPT IS DISABLED IN YOUR BROWSER IF IT ISN&#039;T ALREADY!! ENSURE YOUR BROWSER IS PATCHED OR BANG UP TO DATE.<br /><br />Stay Safe
