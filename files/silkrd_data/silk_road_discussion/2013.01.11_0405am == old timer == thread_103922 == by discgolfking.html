				I am new to silk road but one thing i read on these forums is that alot of these YOUNG GUYS seem to think they know everything about weed. maybe its just me. I have been smoking weed for 40 years almost everyday. I dont know alot of technical stuff and i am not a grower, have grown a few small outdoor grows over the years. when i first started smoking weed it cost 15 DOLLARS an OZ whew that was a long time ago.Have travelled around the world smoked all kinda weed and hash. been to Amsterdam MANY times. one strain&nbsp; i always go back to is JACK HERER one of my favorites. 2nd favorite WHITE WIDOW. seems like they come up with a new strain every week. well hopefully another 40 years of partying. Any old timers want to chirp in.

				I&#039;m a &#039;young timer&#039; here and I started smoking when I was seventeen with my parents and now I&#039;m twenty-two. They&#039;re both in their late sixties so are used to weed like you and when we started smoking together they were blown away by all my glass collection, the fact that my weed was so much stronger and $20/g, $400/oz. Idk just high and my opinion.

				What&#039;s so funny to me is half the lineage given on these strain name databases are as generic as possible.<br />Like Afghani x Skunk #1, when in reality it&#039;s a polyhybrid made from Blue Apollo x Bubblicious.<br />True they are derived from Afghani and a special selective process with the skunk#1 but doesnt the polyhybrid names give you a much better understanding of the type of cannabis you are getting.<br /><br />Afghani x Skunk #1&nbsp; and&nbsp; Blue Apollo x Bubblicious are at least 150 generations different from each other and you have to take into consideration each breeders selective phenotype traits.<br /><br />blah blah blah I know too much about cannabis.<br />Also I&#039;m looking for some buds from a&quot; Church/churchweed&quot; clone if anyone grows it or has even heard of it.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad
