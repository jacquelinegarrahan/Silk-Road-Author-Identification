				How about a fun thread for your messed up dealings with street dealers? My story isn&#039;t great, so I&#039;m hoping you have some :-)<br /><br />So, I think SR is great because...<br /><br />Back in the 90s, I wanted to score some E, and my dealer had none, but was getting some. If I could give him a lift in my car to do a deal, I&#039;d get a bargain deal on about 50. So, like a total noob, off I go. Not only were the pills total garbage, but then soon after that he sent me round &quot;by phone call to a phone he lent me&quot; on my own to a back street garage (actual car repair setup) to ask some guys something or pick something up. I totally forget what it was about now, and when I mentioned his name, they chased me down the road throwing a fucking huge spanner at me that flew past me. Obviously they were ripped off by him, or something.<br /><br />Oh yeah, when I mentioned marquis testing failing, he gave me the usual &quot;dude, all my customers are happy, what the fuck are you on about, grrr?&quot;.<br /><br />SR is harm reduction! The postman won&#039;t smash you in the head with a spanner!<br />
