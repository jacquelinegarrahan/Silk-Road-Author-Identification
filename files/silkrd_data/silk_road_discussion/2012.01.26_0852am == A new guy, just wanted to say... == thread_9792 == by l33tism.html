				Hey to everybody on Silk Road!!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been debating on having anything to do with this site for months, but curiosity has finally won. So I&#039;m here. This place seems pretty legit, full of helpful people, and has tons of good information/products. <br /><br />I will say that it took longer than I&#039;d like to admit attempting to master different programs (first tried the &#039;all linux&#039; approach, but got hung up on several things). Reading up on TOR, TrueCrypt, and PGP Portable plus buying a trusty USB stick has finally lead me to this point. :D These forums were incredibly helpful with various issues and questions I had. <br /><br />So I wanted to say thanks all! I&#039;m excited to be here. And, although getting here was half the battle, I look forward to getting to know this community even more. :)

				stay in escrow, only stick with valued sellers(paperchasing, mitanox, streetpharmacy, ivory, tweetb, spanishfly,vortexmilkman, there are more but i&#039;m too lazy and just read the forums), read the forums obsessively before purchasing a product, only trust the opinion of trusted members on the forum that have at least 50 post, and more then anything be safe and goodluck

				I am new here too, but received first order which I will have tomorrow :)<br /><br />All the advice is here - just research sellers.&nbsp; My first seller DrAmsterdam was great communicator and very fast delivery.<br /><br />+ I get to feel like James Bond sending those funky encrypted messages&nbsp; 8)

				It can&#039;t be said enough, keep up with the forum because this is the place where scams usually break and be careful, listen to your gut, and most importantly, have fun!

				And as said, stay in escrow. DO NOT finalize early. Any seller worth his/her salt doesn&#039;t need you to finalize early. They are financed well enough. If they won&#039;t do business with a noob, go buy small items from someone who will until you build up a small history. Buy some digital goods. <br /><br />Read each sellers profile to see what they are all about. <br /><br />Another good seller who does business with new clients is Pharmville. But they mostly sell opiate pills and benzos.

				Welcome, I&#039;m new to the forum but have been using SR for a little over a month now and have not had any problems.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t hard to start at all.&nbsp; Most of the vendors are very friendly people.&nbsp; Thought I would finally check out the forums and discussions.

				I am new to SR as well; placed two orders and one arrived quickly and the product was legit (thanks PK!) and my other has been in-transit for three days so I hope it gets here tomorrow.&nbsp; I have two papers to write and need those adderall.&nbsp; Forums are such a benefit, run, and frequented by helpful people.&nbsp;
