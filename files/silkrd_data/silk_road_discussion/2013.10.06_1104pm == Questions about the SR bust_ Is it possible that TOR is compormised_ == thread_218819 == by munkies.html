				Ok so the feds shut down the road and they arrest this Ulbricht guy and start bragging about it. But there are some serious questions if this whole bust thing is indeed legit. <br />Some questions arise:<br /><br />1. How come the SR was closed on the same day DPR supposedly got caught?<br />For the FBI to place that shitty photoshopped picture on the SR main page means they have the private key to the SR address. Obviously they didn&#039;t brute force it (that would take a couple of billion years at least) so either DPR actually gave it to them, which makes no sense, or they have had physical access to the SR servers, which brings us to question #2<br />2. How did they find the SR servers? If TOR is so secure, how the hell did the feds locate and seize it&#039;s fucking servers?<br />If they actually did that, it means SR has been compromised for a long time, and LE would have been able to basically impersonate everyone on the road, including DPR himself. But why did they wait until now to shut it down?<br />3. They claim one of the most important pieces of evidence was that question DPR supposedly posted on StackOverflow. They also claim that the identical block of code was found in the SR code. I&#039;m no programmer, however, someone please enlighten me, why would the road have a script that connects to tormail via curl? SR was a really simple ecommerce site with bitcoin support, I simply don&#039;t understand the role of that script.<br />4. Why would DPR try to broker a drug deal and then hire a hitman? Makes 0 fucking sense, by their own claims he was making more money from commissions than that kid could launder in a fucking lifetime. Sounds like a CEO getting a second job as a housekeeper...

				Silk Road was not the Tor network. Tor is not compromised - the network itself runs fine and it is near impossible for any LE or person to decrypt and identify users simply using the Tor protocol. The government has been trying to do this but has only been able to with an extremely small amount of success. I would not be worried about the Tor network alone. To answer your questions:<br /><br /><br />1. DPR was arrested the day before the site was shut down. The criminal complaint was published/found the next day and the site itself was shut down the next day as well. That is when everyone began talking about it as well.<br /><br />2. This isn&#039;t fully answered yet, and I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll find out in the coming months, but from limited research and information there was an apparent code leak in the SR code which allowed a user/users to identify an IP address(s) for a SR node. That was traced to a provider (based in the UK, I believe) who wasn&#039;t aware that SR was hosted with them, and the provider took appropriate action. Now there&#039;s no saying that was the main SR server or the only SR server, but it was enough to get full images of the site since July. <br /><br /><br />3. Can&#039;t answer this question. I&#039;m not a developer myself however there are various potential reasons why that may have been there. It may also just be there to further justify the warrant. We&#039;ll get the details in the coming months. <br /><br />4. This was likely a set up, although (again) we&#039;ll probably find out the real details in the coming months. He was set up by FBI agents earlier in the year (not mentioned in the final warrant that most people read online) in Maryland and ordered a hitman for 80K. The one mentioned in the main complaint (for 150K) was likely something similar, but details remain about this. Likely all of this was used to tie DPR to SR as the main man. By having a) that many bitcoins, b) utilizing the DPR handle which was confirmed as the main administrator account on SR to send PM&#039;s and otherwise, and c) ordering fake identification documents from the same person who he ordered a hitman from (for 150K, which was likely an FBI agent), which was intercepted because the LE knew it was coming since it was their agent all along.<br /><br />By ordering those fake IDs, they had his picture and address. They questioned him about it and he said &quot;someone could have theoretically purchased them from a site called Silk Road&quot; and no further action was taken against him at that time. But now LE had his photo/address and could further verify that the DPR handle on SR was used to order these documents. Why the hitman scenario was hired was likely to make him look bad to a jury and also to get his attention and build trust in the user (who was, again, almost certainly an FBI agent all along). Also, many members who were respected here (vendors and otherwise) who spoke to DPR mentioned that he would casually send messages (sometimes of pretty sensitive information) unencrypted until they would request PGP. Many said that they have no trouble believing he would send PM&#039;s without PGP. <br /><br />In the end, it was just cockiness and simple mistakes that led to his arrest and seizure of Silk Road. Thinking you are invincible can lead to your demise.

				and i heard he didnt even log into the SR server using TOR. like wtf was he thinkin?!? its hardly believable the mastermind behind all this made such stupid and simple mistakes.<br />How was he not using the very security he tried to drill into our fuckin heads?!?!

				I see, I&#039;m curious about how that code leak might have occurred, it&#039;s important that successors to the road don&#039;t make the same mistakes. Also, the fake ID story also raises some question marks, they say he needed the fake ID&#039;s to rent servers, that makes sense, but why would he use his real picture on them.<br />Also, I think a man with his that much money and so much heat should have considered leaving the US long before this happened. I honestly doubt this Ulbricht guy is really the mastermind of all this.

He did use fake ID to lease an apartment and even went by a fake name to many of his friends. Obviously a fake picture wouldn&#039;t work well if you were using the ID in person to person matters as well.<br /><br />Agreed - not sure why he was in the US. Was surprised when I found that out. <br /><br />More information on the code leak - *CLEARNET* - http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/43266/in-the-silkroad-takedown-what-does-it-mean-an-ip-address-was-leaking-in-tor<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m still curious about that code snippet from stackoverflow, from the limited programming knowledge I have from high school I can&#039;t see any relevance it had for the SR website. SR and Tormail were completely separated services, just why did they need a php script to connect to it?
