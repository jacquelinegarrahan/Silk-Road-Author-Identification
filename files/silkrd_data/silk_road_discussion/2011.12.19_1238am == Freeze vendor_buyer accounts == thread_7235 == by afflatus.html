				In order to stop a scamming vendor or buyer, SR should freeze accounts until the issue is resolved. This would force some communication and protect others from falling prey to the scam. It would also be possible to recover some of the lost funds.<br />&nbsp;

				Yes the escrow is a great way to help mitigate the problem, but when the problem compounds there is no sense in having more buyers fall in the same trap. <br />Just freeze the account temporarily until the current problems are resolved. It seems like it might keep everyone on their toes and responsive.<br />

				Escrow is kind of like a big-assed flashing neon sign on the beach that says DANGER - UNPREDICTABLE DEADLY RIP TIDES AND SEVERE UNDERTOW - ABSOLUTELY NO SWIMMING.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s SRs responsibility to be a lifeguard for those that skip past the sign and dive in head first with gusto.

Then SR should remove all forms of protection and let&#039;s roll the dice. I am just proposing that it may slow down scammers (Buyers or Vendors) if they knew that there account could be frozen for a bit. But only when there is a clear sign of abuse. Might be in the interest of SR to appear to be dealing with this problem. Otherwise the good vendors will be tainted by the bad and buyers will finally decide to leave instead of guess and hope.&nbsp;

				So a few folks drown in the rip-tide, and your suggestion is to remove the warning sign?<br /><br />How about tightening up the rules on escrow and making it mandatory, and suspending those who break the rules for a few days?<br /><br />This site won&#039;t survive if Admin has to get involved in thousands of small disputes - and there are thousands of them - when they&#039;d never arise if escrow was used as designed.

				Look i&#039;m going to sum it up real clear for everyone.<br />The Vendors are the scam problem.<br />Any vendor that suggest out of escrow transaction is not doing you a favor.<br />Silk Road was built in a way to protect the vendor and the customers equally.<br />So that each party takes a 50/50 chance on the transaction.<br />Early Finalizations and out of escrow are voids Silk Road respondsibilties, where if you would have just stayed in escrow and not finalized early there would be no problem.<br /><br />Protip: Lower SR User ID# the more reliable they are.<br /><br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				@mrgrey<br />@Norman<br /><br />I am not sure what you are talking about. I followed the advice and never went out of escrow. I have read the forums in detail.<br />Unfortunately, and I am not crying about the money lost. The problem was that all product delivered from three vendors was crap.<br />Yes you are right, I can get 50% back. But what if I really want to find out which vendor is on the up and up? There is absolutely <br />no way. <br />Maybe if the buyer or the vendor had something to lose they may be more careful.&nbsp;
