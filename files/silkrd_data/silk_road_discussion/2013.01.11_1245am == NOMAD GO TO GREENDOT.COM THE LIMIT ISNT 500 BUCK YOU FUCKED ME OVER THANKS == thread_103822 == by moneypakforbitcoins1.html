				God I hope nobody is stupid enough to give this prick bitcoin to prove yourself. I sure as hell won&#039;t. Last I checked I am the reputable vendor with the much needed btc. As for this particular post everywhere that sells MP around me caps it $1000. I do remember Wal-Mart used to sell $1100 and everywhere else sold $500. So both of you were right, but anything this fucker says is plain bullshit. I went ahead and messaged OP and he sent me this:<br /><br />&nbsp;i want a few coins up front im new before i send you the 965 dollar mp please hurry so i can order my qp and get it shipped tomo dirtroad :)<br /><br />please <br /><br />sincerely, 007<br /><br />My simple response is go fuck yourself!!!

				This guy has been trying this same shit for so long, I just don&#039;t get it...no way he is making any money off this. There has to be another reason for it but I can&#039;t figure it out.
