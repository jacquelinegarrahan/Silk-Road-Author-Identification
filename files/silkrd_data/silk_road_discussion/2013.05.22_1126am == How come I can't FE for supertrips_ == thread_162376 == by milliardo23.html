				Ok so it&#039;s been 24 hours since I ordered a small batch from him. It&#039;s my 3rd order and I am a little bit scared it&#039;s coming all the way from Germany to US.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t mind FEing early since he is a trusted seller. <br /><br />So my order is still processing, how long would it be so I can finalize it? I just hope I can FE early so I can get it as soon as possible&nbsp; :(

However, Silk Road recommends that buyers do NOT Finalise Early as we can do nothing to protect you once you have left the safety of the escrow system. When you hit &#039;finalize&#039; you are stating that you have received your order and are 100% satisfied with it. You have no comeback in the event that something goes wrong if you FE.<br /><br />Please read the SR Wiki - it contains everything you NEED to know to keep you safe here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Libertas

				I recommend that you do not FE with ST for any 1g listing. He will not refund you, I find out the hard way.

				I would recommend that you DO NOT F/E&nbsp; you will get ripped off sooner or later and will regret it, almost everyone has learned the hard way not to F/E for anyone, you loose all your protection and any chance of getting your money back, believe me you will thank yourself to listen to this advice
