				Hey, not going to name vendor until I get verification that this is a problem.&nbsp; I&#039;m not inexperienced with smoking weed, however I have very little technical knowledge of it given that it rarely interests me.<br /><br />I ordered 2g of weed a few days ago, its advertised as hydro, I don&#039;t recall whether or not it specifically stated &#039;bud&#039; in the description.<br /><br />What arrived seems to be a cutting from the plant, stem still attached.&nbsp; The stem is roughly 4-5mm diameter so its not just a tiny bit that I can let go as a mistake by vendor.&nbsp; It seems like 30-40% of the weight of the product could be stem.<br /><br />Previously when ordering weed(albeit from different vendors) I&#039;ve recieved a few buds, usually crushed, but very obviously bud.<br /><br />Is this grounds to move to resolution? or is it not a big deal?<br /><br /><br />

				Hi, I&#039;m not sure if I can help too much but I can tell you from my point of view as a stoner/grower is acceptable.<br /><br />Firstly if you want a big bud, it has a big stem in the middle, end of conversation. Now I tend to take a very close angled cut to minimise the amount of stem but keep nice big buds together, I do my best to have no visible stem, if it isn&#039;t surrounded by bud it shouldn&#039;t be there.<br /><br />That said, you should still really finalize, just reflect what you felt in the feedback, if there was stem sticking out&nbsp; you could point out that it was not particularly well manicured but personally I don&#039;t feel it is a reason for a majour complaint unless more than 25% of the weight was stem.<br /><br />Stems are much lighter than buds provided they are properly dried, most of the wieght of bud(30%) is the resin, dry plant matter is very light so it probably didn&#039;t affect your weight too much.<br /><br />Hope that helps, just ask if there is anything more I can be of help with<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor
