				I bought some coins using the bank transfer option and unlike the multiple other times I&#039;ve used that way of buying, my coins are still missing over 18 hours later. I&#039;ve emailed Ben but he&#039;s gone quiet one me. Is there a problem or is it just me?

				Missing from blockchain after purchasing them, or missing from your SR wallet?&nbsp; One would be an issue with blockchain, and the other would be an issue with things moving slowly at SR today.

				Did you search for your receiving address on blockchain.info? Does it show the transaction? Does the transaction have any confirmations?

				I noticed that if you try and use their deposit over phone option it says they are out of coins ATM. (not that i use or would recommend this option)

				They haven&#039;t arrived in my Blockchain wallet, I didn&#039;t get a chance to transfer over to SR which is kind of lucky at the moment.<br /><br />When they&#039;re out of coins they normally have a message up explaining the situation. My email is still unanswered as well. It&#039;s probably nothing major but it&#039;s a pain in ass fucking around and waiting. Will check the blockchain as well.<br /><br />Cheers.

				I believe Blockchain are doing a server move or some form of maintenance according to their Twitter feed, and having a few issues. But don&#039;t hold me to that ;)<br /><br />*CLEARNET SITE*<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40264.msg1651890#msg1651890 <br /><br />This page is linked, it may be useful.

				Same thing happened to me - I ordered using bank transfer on Monday, they only came through last night. I then ordered more last night and they only came through today. I&#039;m not very happy since I missed my chance to the cheaper MDMA from abroad (it wouldn&#039;t arrive in time) and I had no idea where my Â£150 went! I even contacted support and heard nothing back from them at all.<br /><br />Still, guess it&#039;s just a case of waiting it out - presumably they were out of BTC to sell.
