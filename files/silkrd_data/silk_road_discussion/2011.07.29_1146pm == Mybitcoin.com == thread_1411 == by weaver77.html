				Honestly, with as many times as SR has gone down, I&#039;m really not too worried about it.&nbsp; And even if it is down for good and I lost my coin I won&#039;t be that upset.&nbsp; I&#039;m always expecting some shady shit to happen with this stuff so I never have that much money in at once.&nbsp; If it does come back up however, I will be moving my bitcoin out quickly.&nbsp; Any suggestions for substitutes?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m sure most buyers will agree with you. However, if you are a vendor it is not practical to say you won&#039;t have a large amt of BTC in escrow at any given time, even if you transfer it out every day.

I&#039;ve been reading forums where people have 500BTC, proved it with blockexplorer, and (stupidly) had it on a hosted wallet site. That&#039;s dumb.<br />Moving on...the fact that myshitcoin.com hasn&#039;t contacted any users, never offered a password recovery, and has been stagnant for 3 days - I&#039;d say they&#039;ve been DDoS&#039;d, hacked, and have left the building.<br />I don&#039;t care what anyone says about them as &quot;nice guys&quot;.

				this is another reason why im not a big fan of tumblers. you are putting a lot of trust into someone. Its always wise to keep all transactions small and not start another one til the first one is completed. I have a feeling that the online wallet with bitcoin is gone. I hope not for those that have money invested, but I have seen the writing on the wall for weeks. If its true that its a scam, he must have waited til there was a lot of bitcoins and then vamoosed.

				Thanks for that info! But when I want to deposit coins onto SR is what I was asking about. Once I have coins in my wallet on my computer or on Mt.Gox how can I safely get them to SR? Before people said to send them through one or two mybitcoin.com accounts, but clearly that&#039;s no longer an option.

				What really pisses me off is that SR explicitly recommended mybitcoin on a welcome screen, implying that they had vetted the service and all was good.&nbsp; I know not to trust anything and it is all my fault, yada yada yada, but really SR seems to have set everything else up properly that I assumed mybitcoin was a good reference.&nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone had looked over at the bitcoin forum it would have been obvious there were problems with mybitcoin for quite a while.&nbsp; I am just wondering why SR would vouch for mybitcoin.com if they seemed to have dotted their i&#039;s and crossed their t&#039;s on everything else??&nbsp; I am not saying this was intentional or they are involved whatsoever, just pissed and need to vent.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				since i do have a stake in what happens with mybitcoin i have been watching the progress. <br /><br />The block chains are being watched no monies have moved.<br /><br />Sites go down, i still have hope this is temporary &amp; people are naturally reacting strongly because of the potential personal loss.<br /><br />The site is setup anonymously it looks like, if it was an intentional scam i think they would wait for maximum potential gain.

				Thanks Kind Bud, I had no idea that MyBitcoin was such a large repository as I never investigated using it.<br /><br />It does seem quite odd that someone so intricately involved in the original setup of the entire bitcoin currency system would turn out to be a scammer. <br /><br />If they are, I hope they rot in hell.&nbsp; But it certainly seems that the best place to keep BTC is in your private wallet, just moving them to SR or Mt. Gox when you need to exchange or sell.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to go make inquiries about the strength and credibility of Liberty Reserve now here and on OS.&nbsp; It seems like maybe a house check of some of the primary players in all of this is in order.<br /><br />

An associate of mine lost some coinage (nothing to do w mtgox pw) on their online wallet and could not get in contact w ANYONE from mybitcoin.com, not even once.

I&#039;ve been reading forums where people have 500BTC, proved it with blockexplorer, and (stupidly) had it on a hosted wallet site. That&#039;s dumb.<br />Moving on...the fact that myshitcoin.com hasn&#039;t contacted any users, never offered a password recovery, and has been stagnant for 3 days - I&#039;d say they&#039;ve been DDoS&#039;d, hacked, and have left the building.<br />I don&#039;t care what anyone says about them as &quot;nice guys&quot;. Looks like we may have seen our first &quot;insider&quot; theft...I truly hope that these honest folk who are caught in the middle-&nbsp; get their BTC back.<br />I had .02 in there, and could care less. Never kept a balance.

I saw them on the bitcoin wiki. I used https://www.instawallet.org/&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s easier than Mybitcoin since you don&#039;t need to do anything except go to the site, and bookmark it since the unique url is you wallet. I did forget to bookmark once and before I used history to find it I tried emailing using the address listed on the site, and sent a second one saying I had found it thanks anyway, and he did respond to me to say he was glad I found it. Not sure he would or could have helped had I not found the URL in my history, but it was nice to know you could at least get in touch with him if needed. <br /><br />I have no idea how big or safe&nbsp; they are or if it does much to help make bitcoin more anonymous since I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not as big as mybitcoin is/was. Just the only other wallet I have personally used and it worked for me. You have to make your own decisions on where to send your bitcoins, just sharing my experience not an endorsement so use your own judgment.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Here&#039;s where I found instawallet and a list of other wallets you can look into:&nbsp; https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:EWallets<br /><br />REally hope you guys with BTC stuck on mybitcoin get your bitcoins back, and those that are just looking to feel safer transfering money to SR don&#039;t let this stop you from getting high&nbsp; ;D

				Wow, just Wow!! I figured it was a lot of money. I figured it would be in the milions. Now, he must be starting to move some of the money from yesterdays decline. Hes not that stupid to unload it all because the btc would drop like a rock, to almost nothing.<br /><br />You can check out how much is needed to move the btc one way or another by looking at the mobile app on mt. gox it shows in real time all the the transactions. and if you hover over an area it will say. 45k is needed to bring it down to this price or vice versa.<br /><br />So watch, it will slowly go back up then we will see it go down a few dollars, then stop. go back up, than slide agian, repeat til his 1.4 million is turned into cash... Im hoping that the smart guys that are on top of this stuff are watching closely so they can find out where its going. im sure he is using a million different ip address&#039; wallets etc....

				The complete lack of reply...complete lack of any kind of response for this long; it just doesn&#039;t seem like an &quot;accident.&quot; I really hope it is, and the fact that no BTC has been moved yet does mean something...I&#039;m just not sure it means that people will get their BTC back though =(

				I don&#039;t think that the fact that BTC hasn&#039;t moved means much. I believe there is a tool to move BTC between local wallets which would never be displayed on the block chain. Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

Gox to come out publically and say they will be watching for coins from these addresses and will block the sale of them.&nbsp; If as a community the addresses were blocked, then perhaps the site may get reinstated.&nbsp; We can only hope.

				One great/terrible thing about bitcoin is that it is permanent. Stealing bitcoin is like stealing gold. No one should call it bad because it was used for something &quot;wrong&quot; The money/bitcoin is just money/bitcoin (a medium of exchange, way to value something) and is beyond anyone and separate from moral judgment . This is good for proprietors of contraband and bad for victims of theft but ultimately valuable as an exchange. <br /><br />(I bet I am missing more with mybitcoin than any of you, not because I was foolish but because I was using the merchant API. I no longer have access to quite a bit. None of the bitcoin that I stored with mybitcoin.com have been spent or transfered and I do hope they will miraculously reappear. )<br />

				@ntek you are confusing two different stories. <br />17,000btc was the polish exchange. He was still the 3rd of 4th biggest exchange and the biggest none USD broker. He used amazon and the cloud crashed and destroyed the wallet.<br />THEY RECOVERED 100% but it took 6 days and he claimed bankruptcy and total loss in the mean time. (amazon? found the data they lost) They are back up and running. <br /><br />MyBitCoin was the second largest public repository of bitcoin and a pillar in the community. They went off-line with no communication 5 days ago. Many bitcoin businesses used them and have since gone defunct. None of the bitcoin stored with MyBItCoin have been used or transferred since the site went down. <br />

				My spidey senses tell me that being so close to 50 percent isn&#039;t just coincidence. Im betting that Tom ran off with the money.. He said it was &quot;trickled&quot; off for a few days. So, 1/2 your money is gone and you call that a trickle? Plus, they didn&#039;t see that they were getting fleeced? They should have seen any unusual patterns within a few hours, not days. I&#039;m sorry, but Tom has your money..<br /><br />Ok, since there was one sell of 30k bicoins and another of about 20k bitcoins over this weekend, that would mean that there is probably 20k bitcoins that are still out there (assuming that these are the btc&#039;s that were &quot;fleeced&quot;.... <br /><br />Its ironic how soshi made a digital currency so that there cant be any counterfeits,etc he must of not thought of all the scams that are done..lol..MT gox, now this.. This only hurts the btc. if people dont have faith in a currency, no one is going to buy it.. you can forget about mainstream companies to use it.

				Exactly what I was thinking, chronic. Also, the way he&#039;s handling this &quot;receivership&quot; (For those of you who aren&#039;t hip to business lingo, that means they&#039;re bankrupt and are selling off all their stuff to try to pay back the people they owe money to. Usually it ends with the company going out of business for good.) doesn&#039;t strike me as very honest either: First of all, he&#039;s refusing to get any third parties involved or lift his anonymity, and second, I can think of at least two assets that he has that could help recoup the money he &quot;lost&quot;. The domain name could probably fetch a few thousand dollars, and the source code, instead of becoming a &quot;gift to the community&quot;, should be sold as well. You have responsibilities like that when you lose other people&#039;s money.

Plus, they didn&#039;t see that they were getting fleeced? They should have seen any unusual patterns within a few hours, not days. I&#039;m sorry, but Tom has your money..<br /><br />Ok, since there was one sell of 30k bicoins and another of about 20k bitcoins over this weekend, that would mean that there is probably 20k bitcoins that are still out there (assuming that these are the btc&#039;s that were &quot;fleeced&quot;.... <br /><br />Its ironic how soshi made a digital currency so that there cant be any counterfeits,etc he must of not thought of all the scams that are done..lol..MT gox, now this.. This only hurts the btc. if people dont have faith in a currency, no one is going to buy it.. you can forget about mainstream companies to use it. I sure as hell wouldn&#039;t use it in my main stream business.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are right on the money, once again, CP!&nbsp; In any situation where there is a loophole you only have to leave it to homo sapiens to find a way to exploit it and screw their fellow humans.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, I hate to say it, but I finally believe you&#039;re right about Tom.&nbsp; All the guys who were early adapters with BTC know the numbers and patterns inside and out.&nbsp; To think he could be so distracted or whatever that he didn&#039;t notice 50% of the entirety of his companies coins going out...that&#039;s one of those ones that if you&#039;re in court they call you a liar because they say it&#039;s negligence (as in &quot;he knew or should have known&quot;).&nbsp; <br /><br />I find it particularly sad that the people, like yourself, who do actual work (and do it well) to earn their BTC are always the ones who lose out in any scam/hack/devaluation and the ones who steal just get away scott free because of the anonymity.&nbsp; &nbsp;I really hope one of the tech gurus figures out how to find the people who do this kind of thing.&nbsp; They are the scum of the Earth and if they thought there was even a tiny chance they could be discovered, I&#039;m pretty sure their cowardice would prevent them from doing the stealing.<br /><br />Hopefully the systems used by institutions (like Mt. Gox) will be made bulletproof (or nearly) and all of the guys who have hoarded BTC since the beginning will finally let go of it and monetize it so we can all get back to the business of business.&nbsp; The only saving grace is that BTC tends to slowly but surely rise right back towards it&#039;s &quot;pre catastrophic event&quot; level every time this happens.&nbsp; I think that speaks to the persistence of people wanting to get hold of the unique products available for BTC (read: drugs! ;)&nbsp; ) more than it does to anything else.&nbsp; I also think that even if there are only ever 50,000 people in the world who use and trade BTC that that&#039;s enough to make a small but very viable economy with them. :D

				So I processed my claim today and only got half of what I had there, thought it&#039;s better to get some than none.&nbsp; Never will I trust an online wallet again.&nbsp; Losses are not too much, did not have a lot in there, but I am not a happy person over it.&nbsp; What pisses me off the most is the lack of responsibility these guys take.&nbsp; &quot;Tom&quot; mentions someone was trickling coin out, but 78,739.58205388 is not exactly a trickle over a few days! it&#039;s more a massive theft over several days!&nbsp; From the sounds of it, there is no official bankruptcy happening here so Tom has no protection whatsoever from a lawsuit.&nbsp; There needs to be an investigation into who this Tom Williams really is and then a class action launched against him.

				I&#039;m afraid Tom will retire to a small community on the shores of mexico or some place like that. I&nbsp; highly doubt you will ever hear or see him again. Also, he says that he is going to release his software to the community. i hope somebody goes over that code with a fine tooth comb. I bet he will put vulnerabilities in it so&nbsp; that he can steal again.<br /><br />It sure was convenient to say &quot;we had a small leakage for a few days&quot; he downplayed it big time. I thought there would be a lot more than what there was. Also, who knows the system better than tom? I can guarantee you he knew all the issues with his code. He played it perfectly.<br /><br />I also thought people were keeping track of the bitcoin addresses and none had moved. So, if that is correct, how could this leakage take place? wouldnt there need to be an address it &quot;leaked&quot; to? It just smell rotten from beginning to end..

				The entire claim process is only so Mr. Tom Williams has plausible deniability if he ever is tracked down and prosecuted. This guy is no amateur. He&#039;s covering his bases 100%.<br /><br />The only way anyone will ever believe his story is full disclosure of the security vulnerability + code + logs. He has released none. You can bet your ass the code will be fixed once it is released.<br /><br />A couple good links:<br />http://www.betabeat.com/2011/08/05/mybitcoin-disappeared-with-bitcoins/<br />http://www.betabeat.com/2011/08/08/mybitcoin-spokesman-finally-comes-forward-what-did-you-think-we-did-after-the-hack-we-got-shitfaced/<br />http://pastebin.com/MfPt99eR

				I would also recommend getting a yubikey for those on Mt. Gox. I could post my username and password to mt.gox and no one could get into my account without the key. Its awesome. The only downside is that I would be screwed if I ever lost it.. Its water proof, pretty much crush proof. It only cost 30 bucks.<br /><br />Every time you log in you touch it and it creates a new key to let you in. I feel a lot safer with it...

After getting their assholes ripped open, they got serious - TH does not offer this, and may - but remember it was mtgox&#039;s answer to users who were very concerned with security. OTP (one time password @ 44chars is balls). You also need to physically touch it. No botting. Unless your bot does reverse forensics. (Hit me up with that code.)<br /><br />Yubikey is ESSENTIAL for those who want the maxiumum security. as CP said however, the only caveat is losing it. get a piercing on your nutsack and make that shit your keychain!<br /><br />b
