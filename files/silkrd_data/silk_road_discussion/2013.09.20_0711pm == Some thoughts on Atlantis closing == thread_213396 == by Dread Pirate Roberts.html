				Atlantis was good for Silk Road and the community at large and I am sad to see it go.&nbsp; Yes they were a bit cocky and aggressive, but they never crossed the line and did anything unethical, and they served their customers well.&nbsp; They reminded us in the Silk Road administration that to stay #1, we have to be constantly thinking of our users and how to serve them best and can not take for granted your loyalty.<br /><br />There has been more than one occasion where I have wanted to quit as well.&nbsp; Without going into details, the stress of being DPR is sometimes overwhelming.&nbsp; What keeps me going is the understanding that what we are doing here is more important than my insignificant little life.&nbsp; I believe what we are doing will have rippling effects for generations to come and could be part of a monumental shift in how human beings organize and relate to one another.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have gone through the mental exercise of spending a lifetime in prison and of dying for this cause.&nbsp; I have let the fear pass through me and with clarity commit myself fully to the mission and values outlined in the Silk Road charter.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t read it yet, please do.&nbsp; Here is the link:<br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/charter<br /><br />The bottom line is... Silk Road is here to stay so long as there is breath in my lungs, a spark in my mind, and fire in my heart.&nbsp; I know many of you in this community feel the same way and is an honor to stand beside you here.<br /><br />Lastly, to anyone considering opening another market, you WILL face unexpected challenges one way or another, and if you don&#039;t have the conviction to overcome them then your efforts will likely be in vain.&nbsp; And please open up a dialogue with me if you do open another site.&nbsp; Even competitors can talk from time to time on friendly terms :)<br /><br />Atlantis admins, if you are reading this, I hope you stick around and contribute as you are able.

				Roaring applause to you DPR. I too abso-f0cking-lutely LOVE you and everything you stand for and have done. You&#039;re my hero and a mentor to many of us. <br /><br />You&#039;re right - Silk Road will cause a shift in thinking that will ripple down through generations to come...improving lives everywhere.<br /><br />SR is making history and in its very early stages, and I can understand you wanting to quit. It must be so overwhelming being DPR and not being able to talk about the stress and fears that go with it to anyone in person in the physical space. <br /><br />For selfish reasons I don&#039;t want you to quit and for the greater good of the world I don&#039;t want you to quit. <br /><br />If you&#039;re ever lonely and want a little spitfire of a wife to massage your shoulders, huff on and wipe your spectacles for you and prepare you a bowl of sticky indica at the end of a hard day&#039;s revolution-leading then give me a shout. ;) xxx<br /><br />And good for you not crowing and gloating over Atlantis&#039; demise... Many lesser people would have.

				@ DPR<br /><br />They failed because they talked to much shit and could not back it up. They tried to run before they could walk. They were SHIT from the get go. As your only as good as your leader. They ultimately were just a skin...and they tried to pry all the &quot;top&quot; vendors from here to go there. And there big selling point was lower fees. They forgot to mention...lower class and no buyers except when some from SR trickled over there when SR would go down for 15 min and they would start panicking and saying &quot;SR is in control of the FBI&quot;. I wonder who started those rumors???<br /><br />Competition is good....but they were the WNBA to our NBA. The&nbsp; Arena Football league to our NFL. They were not competition. They were a back up if you had a heart attack and Libby took over SR.<br /><br />You took the high road in what you said. But the facts are they were no good. PERIOD. They brought nothing to the table. The reason why the site was so called &quot;really&nbsp; fast&quot; is no one was on there. They had a chance to get market share when SR was down for a week or longer a few months ago. By an amazing coincidence...they just happen to open up that week. And yes some of the crazies went over there to set up shop but in reality there were more sales done in the forums here...then over there.<br /><br />The only good thing that came out of them opening was it lit a fire on your ass.(your ass being Silk Road) Kind of like when the bulls were up 35 in the 3rd quarter...and the Knicks cut it to 25 going into the 4th. So Jordan and Pippen came back in to start the fourth and in the first 3 minutes..they got the lead back to 35. They were never in danger of losing. And they were way ahead...but just in case... they brought the starters back and ran the lead right back up and ended up winning by 41 and swept them in 4 games. We are the Bulls and you are Jordan.<br /><br />Of course you were humble in what you said. But the fact is we as a community are great.... No.... fantastic. And with you as the captain the sky is the limit. So thank you to your crew and you. We may not all love the changes now. But NO ONE doubts you made them in the best interest of us going forward and being better. I am proud to be a vendor on Silk Road. And I am proud to say I never went to that site. There was never a need. When I am getting blowjobs...I do not go looking for handjob&#039;s.<br /><br />I am glad Atlantis..........walked the plank.<br /><br />Fuck Atlantis<br />

				Thanks DPR. I am paranoid enough being a vendor.<br />But I want to stay here for a while yet because I too believe Silk Road gives people the freedom they deserve.<br />Every extra vendor we get is an asset to Silk Road. If it weren&#039;t for Silk Road, I would not have been able to obtain some of the drugs I have now tried.

				i never started vending on Atlantis....but they should have planned and though a bit harder of all the hurdles they would have faced<br /><br />I feel like adding my 2 cents here on DPRs comments....<br /><br />DPR and SR are true revolutionaries and revolutionary ideas are immortal....as long as there will be moon and sun DPR&#039;s name will be taken with utmost respect by future generations.<br /><br />Tyrannical governments and their enforcement thugs protecting rich people assets can take your freedom/ life but can never stop spread of an idea whose time has come. You are a legend and a forebearer of struggle for individual rights and free trade.<br /><br />DPR and SR has and is making history every day....LE can take life/ freedom but how they gonna stop the legend which will influence more radicle ideas....LE cannot take his legacy away from him...His name will be etched forever in sands of time and will be taken with respect <br /><br /><br />60 years ago there was another man who challenged law of the day and faced jail and suffering....his ideas were ahead of time....but today we all agree what he did was moral and just...We call him Mahatma Gandhi now<br /><br />DPR you not alone...there are millions of people behind you..much more than LE can jail...soon LE will realise they the minority here and wil join our revolution<br /><br />MP<br /><br /><br />

				We knew you&#039;d be selfless about it, as a good winner never over kills a good loser. When they came bounding onto the scene, a lot of noise&nbsp; was made. <br /><br />The aggressive marketing was a little over the top. I can only offer an opinion on what we know as fact. Maybe you know more DPR as he/they&nbsp; claim to have&nbsp; forewarned&nbsp; you of any security breaches. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad you stuck it out and kept SR the focus of your insignificant little life ( modest again !&nbsp; ) but aren&#039;t we all insignificant in the grand scheme of SR and the freedoms it affords us? <br /><br /><br />

With all the attention on Tor being vulnerable and the NSA looking more closely at Tor the only thing that;s keeping me on here is my faith in DPR and his convictions. In spite of all the recent events I have so much faith in SR that I recently opened a vendor account. I believe that SR is resilient from a technolgy standpoint and it&#039;s community. <br /><br />I think we all kinda knew that Atlantis was just a passer by. They probably thought wow look how much money SR are makes but the never thought of the stress of that kind of operation. I&#039;m just planning on being a small time vendor and my level of stress is way worse now than before so I can&#039;t begin to imagine the mental fortitude of DPR so to you sir I give you credit not only for that but also for the classy way you deal with issues and conflicts.

				This seems like as good a time as any to thank DPR for the work he does. I know I&#039;m not exactly running this place, I&#039;m a small market dealer but it&#039;s still a lot of work. The thing that makes it most worthwhile for me is the messages I get from cancer sufferers, medical patients and the chronically ill thanking me for providing relief, cures and bringing families torn apart by terminal diseases back together. The credit goes as much to you as anyone else, you are ultimately responsible for making it all possible.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				First- many thanks to DPR- it is heartening to read your conviction! THANK YOU! second im sorry to see ATl go- competition benefits everyone- third as mentioned by the good doctor, many of the products here are not just for recreation- there is the potential to improve the quality of lives that perhaps cannot happen in other ways- so i offer my sincere gratitude to all on the road and especially in this community- i cannot express how much i have learned reading through the posts here- so keep it coming and may the road rise!<br />riy

				Several years ago, I had contacts. I phoned people from payphones, met them in car parks and bought items that could have got me arrested. Doubtless, there was a buzz about the whole &quot;underground&quot; feel of these transactions, and they helped me enjoy some of the best nights out (and in) with the best friends a person could ever wish for.<br /><br />Years passed, I got a good job, a family, and my contacts went. No matter how fondly I looked back on my times of debauchery, I didn&#039;t have the contacts to repeat them, no matter how much I yearned for it.<br /><br />Last week, I went out with an old friend and relived those times on some awesome MDMA, loving the world and everyone in it.<br /><br />And the crazy thing was it was delivered to my door. No risky meetings in dimly lit public spaces. No stress - just a few clicks (after a LOT of research, admittedly) and I&#039;m enjoying peer reviewed, premium quality goodies with no harm to myself or anyone else.<br /><br />SR is truly revolutionary, its impact will echo for generations, and ultimately I can see only a positive impact on humanity, as it takes people&#039;s decisions and interactions on personal consumption out of the seedy underbelly of society and into a safer, more (self)regulated environment.<br /><br />And without DPR, all this would be nothing.<br /><br />I feel privileged to be a part of it.

				Sent you a PM DPR, but I&#039;ll share some of my thoughts here.<br /><br />SR has enabled my life to improve by buying stuff discreetly and fronting it to friends who sell it. It helps me keep my hands clean, while making some extra cash to keep the pressure off me. I have serious alimony and child support to pay that stresses me the fuck out. More than just helping me, it&#039;s allowing some fellows I&#039;ve known for a long time and consider my closest friends to live a bit more comfortably too, keeping them in smoke and cigs and beer, which is a big deal to guys who are barely getting by, and who are getting older without much a future to look forward to. <br /><br />I&#039;m grateful, and so are they, you all can rest assured of that!

				<br />Well said. You&#039;re a born leader and it shows. <br /><br />You&#039;re also incredibly brave! You have to know that Tor&#039;s days are numbered. Tor had a great run, provided humanity an important service and made a lasting impact but, it was a weak platform from inception. It&#039;s on life support right now. (Hindsight is 20/20, it looked great 8-10 years ago)<br /><br />We all knew the NSA had some fucking crazy tactics but, in recent months the world is getting its very first glimpse at just how powerful that organization has become.<br /><br />Sadly, I have a strong suspicion that in due time you&#039;re real identity will be revealed. You&#039;re fighting the good fight but, the adversary has grown powerful beyond our wildest imaginations. <br /><br />You&#039;re no dummy, you know that you have teams (plural) of the worlds brightest engineers and crypto experts actively hunting you. Working 7 days a week with a near unlimited budget, you&#039;re still just one guy (or maybe a few?). You know the weaknesses in tor exist.<br /><br />You&#039;re true to your belief and I can&#039;t commend you enough. When the time comes, like any good captain, you&#039;re going down with the ship. I suspect you&#039;ll get a following similar to &quot;FREE KEVIN&quot;. In a strange way, it might be a huge relief as you&#039;ll be able to openly communicate after having being forced into silence for so many years.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;d close up shop and open source the server side code so that others can take this idea and run with it, far further than just you can run alone. Start the DPR Foundation, dedicated to furthering the cause. Invest in startup ventures, lots of cool stuff you could do. We&#039;re all better off with guy like you on this side of the bars!&nbsp; Maybe take some of the BTC you&#039;ve tucked away and invest in developing a better, more secure solution to take the place of Tor, then launch SilkRoad 2.0 on that technology. <br /><br />Regardless, you&#039;re a brave man who&#039;s almost single handedly lit a fuse (albeit very primed) that fired the 1st meaningful shot back in the war on drugs. Long live you are what you stand for!<br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think I would feel safe working with someone who didn&#039;t realize the possibility of getting caught. Our security depends a hell of a lot on the security measures you implement. <br /><br />Just to quote the recent BBC article<br />http://www.channel4.com/news/drugs-dark-web-atlantis-silk-road-police-fbi<br /><br />&quot;However, Silk Road is still up and running. A source close to the FBI told Channel 4 News that it has &quot;exceptionally good operational security&quot;, and its owners avoid personal meetings in order to stay under the radar.&quot;<br /><br />Its very reassuring to hear things like that.<br /><br />Just a side note, and not meaning to hijack the thread... to all you guys asking about our opium quality.. further down the article <br /><br />&quot;Channel 4 News bought 3.5g of MDMA and one gram of opium. Both were tested and found to be pure, before being destroyed by a Home Office-licensed lab. &quot; <br /><br />Many thanks to the BBC for taking the time to purity test our opium, next time we would like to be mentioned in the article by name, sucks you had it destroyed, I bet Jeremy Paxman would have had a night on it. <br /><br />ACE

				I love DPR more than any of you, combined. <br /><br />DPR knows why. <br /><br />But I want to mention that we are not alone. BMR (Black Market Reloaded) is still up and running and buyers are buying and sellers are selling. <br /><br />If you believe in what DPR stands for, then support your *other* local free market exchange and list some shit or buy some goodies off of BMR too. It is not disloyal, it is supporting THE CAUSE!<br /><br />http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/<br /><br />I fucking love DPR and I want one of us to have our baby (whichever of us is female).<br /><br />Go DPR, GO!!!<br /><br />Modzi

				Cognitive liberty in action. Long live DPR! I hope we grow old together so I can read the memoirs you said you&#039;d write in Forbes. Hopefully one day this site will be as &quot;legit&quot; as amazon and the threat of incarceration for what we do in our private homes will be a thing of the past. Promoting accountability for purity of product and harm reduction are things i love that happen here with the best of the best. I am loyal as hell to those vendors. Strive to be the best, evolve, innovate and strive to keep each other safe.
