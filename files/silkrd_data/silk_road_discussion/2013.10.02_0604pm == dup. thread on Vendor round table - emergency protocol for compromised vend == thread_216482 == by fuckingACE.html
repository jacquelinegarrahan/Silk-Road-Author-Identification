				Hi, <br />please try keep this thread as close to the top as possible. <br /><br />various vendors for whatever reason may feel that they are now compromised due to the seizure of the SR Servers. If you feel you are in imminent danger and have nowhere else to go then thhis ifs for you: <br /><br />TSC has always paid.to maintain a backup plan in the case that anythig whent very wrong, in order to be able to.continue operations in the case of a catastrophy. <br /><br />If you feel in danger and feel your operating address is compromise and yu cannot safeley transfer ops to shhep or BMR we can help. we have severas safe houses in the EU and north Africa with 20mbit sattelite uplinks and all equipment needed to continue working. <br /><br />message only if you have no other option<br /><br />ace

				Designated safe houses? Damn that&#039;s badass. It&#039;s a huge shame that this has finally come to an end, just wanted to say a big thanks for the vendors and staff that made this possible for so long.<br /><br />(Also FartBomber if you&#039;re around get in touch, got a few questions about if my last order was processed).<br /><br />All the best guys.

				Finished cleaning this place up and burning everything. I´m off to one of the other locations I need a few weeks at the beach. It looks like the FBI have enough info to be able to trace wallet transactions. I never cashed out without cleaning my coins first so I hope thats the same for all of you. The only thing that has me worried is the FH firefox exploit ages ago. Ever since that happened I´ve had a really bad feeling, I know people say they wouldnt be able to trace you from that, but yeh, dunno, Today nothing adds up that much. <br /><br />See you all in a bit.
