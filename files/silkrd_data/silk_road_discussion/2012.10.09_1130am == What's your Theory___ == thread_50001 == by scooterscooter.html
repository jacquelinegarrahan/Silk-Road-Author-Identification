				Hi guys,<br />One of the things i love about SR is the various strains of weed you can get here, great choices. ;D<br />Now, i placed a nextday order a week ago, and after four days i contacted the vendor. He was apologetic about the situation, very polite and offered to resend the order. Nice guy i thought. New package should have been here Saturday. Waited until Tuesday just in case, but still nothing.<br />I think there&#039;s a problem on his postal side, as i have ordered more weed from a different vendor, both uk mainland and that came no problem what so ever.<br />Any advise on my next plan of action?

				First off, if they can&#039;t provide DCN assume they never shipped it out.<br /><br />Check their feedback, see if this is a repeating trend. Even vendors&#039; w/ decent feedback selectively scam. If you finalized early theres really not a lot you can do but not order from them again.

				I hate when vendors do this, they keep you waiting for so long that sometimes your order ends up auto-finalizing. The best thing to do is, never finalize early, always check feedback, and wait for up to 12 days, if nothing arrives just go into resolution center and ask for refund. Vendors most of the time scam the new buyers, so if your new, buy a couple of products that are relatively cheap from vendors with (100) rating to have better stats and more transactions complete. Personally i only buy from vendors with 97-100 rating and thats it. A lot of vendors dont mess around with established buyers. If it seems like you dont know what you are doing, vendors will take advantage. Dont FE when your new!

				Sorry that this is happening to you.&nbsp; I had the same thing happen with a vendor I had been using for 2 months.&nbsp; Maybe he is just a little overwhelmed?&nbsp; If it is domestic and it doesn&#039;t arrive by Friday I would request a refund.&nbsp; Did the vendor give you a DCN?

				If you already FEd then you&#039;re SOL if not take it to resolution and if the vendor can&#039;t prove they shipped it (tracking # etc) then you get a refund.
