				State your policy on your vendor page and you will feel better about sticking to it.<br />If tracking shows it was delivered, I assume it is a problem at their end. I feel I have done my job correctly. Send them the number.<br />I&#039;d say it is a rare buyer who will try to claim you should re-ship if tracking shows it was delivered. <br />If you don&#039;t have tracking, and they receive it and they see no tracking on it, however, I think the number of scammer buyers is likely to be much greater.

				Case-by-case basis.<br />Most (99.9%) of customers are simply a delight to do business with.<br /><br />But, there is always a few bad apples... PARTICULARLY, in this industry.<br /><br />Stick to the facts. Leave emotions out of it.<br /><br />Generally speaking, domestic parcels don&#039;t go missing.<br />There is always exceptions, but not really in the case where tracking shows &quot;Delivered&quot;.<br /><br />Technically, once Aust. Post logs it as &quot;delivered&quot;, they take full responsibility for any losses.<br />Ie: Registered parcels (Inc. Express), are covered by an insurance policy. (For example: Up to $500 coverage on 500g Express post bags).<br /><br />If you have issued the tracking number to the customer, perhaps suggest they take the tracking number to their P.O. and ask where it is...<br />.... then claim for the loss.<br /><br />OBVIOUSLY, one does not say &quot;Where&#039;s my delivery of illicit Drugs&quot;.<br />I suggest a more tactful/inconspicuous approach. (Parcel should be some silver bullion I have been expecting....I think).<br /><br />Anyway, there is no &quot;right&quot; answer here I&#039;m afraid.<br />One case will be legitimate, the next will be a scum-bag.<br /><br />It gets easier with experience.<br />Max@OG<br /><br /><br />

				Buttonwood, sorry to hear someone is trying to scam you, that really sucks.&nbsp; I&#039;m posting just to say you are fast becoming one of my favorite vendors for high quality herb and I hope this doesn&#039;t discourage you from continuing to operate here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a package I ordered domestic go missing, and if it did, with the vendor having tracking that showed delivery, I would assume it got lost or stolen.&nbsp; That&#039;s just part of the nature of this marketplace we all take part in and I think a buyer expecting a full refund or reship for an order that a vendor can show was delivered is absurd.&nbsp; Buyers have to take their share of the risk, and lost or stolen packages is just part of that.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been very lucky and have dealt with mostly fantastic people.&nbsp; 99% of my orders have shipping tracking, and this delivery confirmation means a lot!&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve learned here so far, most sellers create a &quot;policy&quot; and post it on their Profile Page.&nbsp; I was careful to think this through before actually shipping anything, so buyers are informed as to what the expectations are.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m kind and fair, but firm while sticking to those rules. <br /><br />I&#039;ve read that once a transaction goes to resolution, both parties can agree to a varying amount of refund.&nbsp; Probably depends on what Policies they had posted, and how reliable their tracking info is.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope you have better luck!
