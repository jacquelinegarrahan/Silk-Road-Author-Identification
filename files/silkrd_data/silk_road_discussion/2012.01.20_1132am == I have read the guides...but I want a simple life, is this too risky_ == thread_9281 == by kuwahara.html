				The more and more I read the guides - the more I am getting put off buying anything here.&nbsp; I know there are very good reasons for everything, but I am only going to purchase rarely, so the recommended effort seems immense.<br /><br />Here is what I plan to do:<br /><br />1. Get some coins from MTGOX via TOR with an email address I will create and fake name<br />2. Send them to instawallet.org after changing TOR identity (however both TOR and IE warn me this site is not secure - should I worry?)<br />3. Move to a second wallet on instawallet.org<br />4. Buy something from SR - using reputable seller and the secure comms (yet to read on that yet)<br />5. Ship to my REAL address....yes, I really can&#039;t ship anywhere else<br />6. Finalize when product is here - using ESCROW<br /><br />Does anyone else work this simply?&nbsp; I am thinking for small amounts no authorities will care a bit for me as the cost of coming to see me outweighs the result for them.<br /><br />Live in UK btw.<br /><br />Many people link to guides, but a simple one should be stickied on this forum I think??

				Hi,<br /><br />imo paysafacard / ukash / moneypak are the easiest and safest way to get bitcoins.<br />You just buy them with cash, no ID necessary.<br /><br />Of course you will probably loose a lot when converting those (PSC 20% at virwox),<br />but maybe you can find someone who does it cheaper.

				Thanks for the reply - I have used Ukash once before on another forum to get diaz before.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I don&#039;t want to keep adding cost on top. <br /><br />If I buy from MTGOX with my card then yes my details are&nbsp; traceable&nbsp; - but there is not an easy way to trace that to a purchase on SR is there?&nbsp; And for small amounts no police force would justify the spend surely?

				Silk Road has a wallet laundering system. If you add bitcoins to your SR account they are routed randomly through a number of other dummy accounts before they finally arrive. For this reason it&#039;s relatively safe to send straight from your buyer to SR, although plenty of people do choose to use instawallet or something in between.<br />&nbsp;The other important thing you didn&#039;t mention is to use PGP to encrypt your address when you send it to the seller. At the end of the day, you are committing a serious crime, even if your chances of actually getting more than a warning letter are very low. Even with the best security in the world SR will never be 100% safe due to the human factor. However, only ordering occasionally is relatively safe. If you get a letter notifying you of a seizure or just if something goes missing and it doesn&#039;t seem like the seller scammed you, then you can stop. Plenty of people chose not to and have yet to suffer any major consequences, although there have been a few people &#039;caught&#039;. Hard to know what the consequences of this is, but if you compare the data of the network averaging around 4*** packages per week to the amount of people complaining about missing packages or being concerned they might be under investigation by LE, it doesn&#039;t seem too bad.

				Yes, I intend to use PGP (when I learn how) to encrypt my info.<br /><br />Also forgot to mention I will try to find a seller from same country, but at the mo the best I can find seems to be withing EU.&nbsp; I want to minimize customs stuff if possible.

				Thanks PK - they are not in order of importance really.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not worried if I have to use MTGOX via TOR or whatever.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been reading, that&#039;s the point.&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not bothered about &quot;great&quot; security - it isn&#039;t worth it as I am not buying a gun, or a kilo.&nbsp; I am buying small amount.&nbsp; I am just wondering if people operate as simply as the method above.<br /><br />Some of the guides I read say you are INSANE not to have run your coins through 4-5 wallets, used fake IDs, PO boxes, encrypted hard drive space, delete everything after touching etc.&nbsp;

				You should not ship to your own house, always ship to a clean address. There is no way that you are limited only to your house. You can get a PO box or even just ask your neighbors/local corner shop if you can have a package delivered there. Most will say yes as it is reasonable for a person to be out during the daytime.

				I will try looking at the address thing, but not sure I can get anyone to do that.<br /><br />Anyway, I just found that https://btc-e.com/ accept Ukash as a payment.&nbsp; &nbsp;This sounds easier as I can just get Ukash voucher anonymously and then get the coins with that......seems to make it a bit simpler.<br /><br />Anyone use them with Ukash?

				Intersango makes everything so easy. Your coin exchange will forever be associated with your bank account, but I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s an issue if you&#039;re a small time buyer. <br /><br />Also I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything wrong with using your own address.<br /><br />Some people on here focus a little too much on what could be suspected by the trail you leave, rather than what could be proven in court. Can you imagine the clusterfuck that would be a prosecution case involving drugs purchased with bitcoins on a TOR hidden website and delivered in the post? Basically the only way they&#039;d get a conviction would be if you admitted something in an interrogation. And if you&#039;re buying a few grams of class A they&#039;d never let it go to court in the first place.<br /><br />In summary, if you&#039;re a small time buyer just get your bitcoins, do the deal and have them posted to your own address. If you&#039;re caught, say nothing. Let them prove what they suspect you of.

				I found a site called bitcoin2cash.com that you can buy bitcoins with cash thru the mail anonymously. I plan on trying it soon. The cool thing is it all seems to be free until you cash out, then they only charge $5 and send you your cash in the mail. Sounds cool to me.

				its my understanding, according to SR, that sending my address to a vendor without pgp is safe. And.....they say, if you would feel more comfortable encrypting your address as an additional safegaurd, then do so. Ive felt comletely secure with SR transferring my address to vendors. I am limited in my communications , as there is yet no viable pgp for android. would i use pgp if i could? i wouldnt worry about sending my address...but id love to be pgp competant for additional communications. some of my vendors have been willing to answer questions i have.<br /><br />anyone want to comment on the preceeding?
