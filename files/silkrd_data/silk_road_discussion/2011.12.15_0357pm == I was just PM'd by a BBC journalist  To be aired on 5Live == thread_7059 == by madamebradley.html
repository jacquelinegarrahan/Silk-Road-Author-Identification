			<dd class="postbody">
				So less than an hour ago I received a private message from a 0 post user who stated she is &quot;researching a programme about Silk Road for BBC Radio.&quot; <br /><br />She goes on to say &quot;I’m really interested in what attracts people to this website. I have read a lot of posts where people say they feel safer buying drugs online and that they like the idea of sellers being held accountable for the quality of the product.<br /><br />Some people have also written about being attracted to something that is beyond the control of the state.&quot;<br /><br />Now I see this going a few ways so lets brainstorm how we want to proceed before doing anything drastic. I haven&#039;t shared her user account or her personal details because I want to go about this rationally. <br /><br />First, I (and/or others) could speak to her about the website and gather publicity for it. This could mean new customers and vendors which could either improve the quality and availability of products, or invite more scammers and lowlifes.<br /><br />Second, we could just ignore her. Her BBC radio program (or programme as our friend in the UK calls it) would be fairly lame if she can&#039;t use a recorded interview of a vendor or a buyer. <br /><br />Third, we dance naked in the woods.<br /><br />Thoughts? <br /><br />---<br /><br />Update Dec 15: I decided to reply and consent to an interview.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Update Dec 16: The journalist responded via PM with a few questions. She also informed me that the programme will be aired on 5Live.<br /><br />The questions are about buyer and seller motivation to use Silk Road as well as philosophical reasons for its usage. Nothing about the &quot;deep web&quot;, tor, .onion websites, bitcoins etc

				Just tell &#039;em everything you know. Point her to these forums so she can do her own research, and specifically to this thread, so she knows the community is self aware.<br /><br />My reasoning: no sense keeping quiet about a public forum. The only way to deal with scammers and lowlifes in onionland is to reduce them to statistical insignificance with more average, honest, &quot;normal&quot; people around here.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much though. It&#039;s unlikely that people who listen to BBC radio are going to be leaping out of their stuffy old armchairs, snuffing their pipes and firing up the PC to download tor. Not exactly the gawker crowd.

				Did she say which BBC radio station it&#039;s going to be broadcasted on? <br /><br />It could be a pretty interesting programme if they talk about it without bias and scare tactics. <br /><br />As others have said, it won&#039;t bring in a noticeable influx of new users - it&#039;ll give some people some dinner party conversation but that&#039;s about it. <br />

				MaDameBradley, I would be very, very careful with this. While it;s great to imagine it will be a Boom to SR, bear in mind that Today&#039;s Media leans towards Negative Bias. Dirty Laundry gets the Ratings. If story is shared with other American media, 20/20 for example...remeber what happened to Michael Jackson. He was interviewed and from that interview he was later prosecuted as a child molester. As result of that Interview, kids started coming forward w accusations. Inside you may feel kinda special about being interviewed by BBC, but I think she should do her own research here on Forums now that she has created her own account.

				For what it&#039;s worth- I found SR via the article on Wired.com a few months back. Now, it&#039;s not like I&#039;m a huge buyer yet; I&#039;ve only made half a dozen or so purchases thus far. But, I def plan on continuing. So, who knows? It could possibly lead to a few more buyers and vendors. <br /><br />However, the cons of publicity are, well, obvious. So, I&#039;d say, go with option 3. ;)

				As a news disseminating organization, I&#039;d give the BBC rather higher marks than most top rated organizations elsewhere.<br /><br />But when it comes to human interest and lifestyle angles, they can suck real fucking bad. Badly.<br /><br />So my first questions are who is this person, what is their objective for the story, and what have they done before that you can easily access.<br /><br />No reason they can&#039;t supply that information - it&#039;s not like they&#039;re undercover at Piccadilly Circus - so that anyone so interested in dealing with them has an even chance of it coming out anywhere close to their expectations.<br /><br />Silk Road is a market running on a hidden service, but it&#039;s not a hidden market. It&#039;s 100% open to anyone who takes the effort to find it. The vendors and the buyers are anonymous, the site itself is not.<br /><br />Treating it like some top fucking secret underworld lair that only a few know how to access pisses me off. Google Tor Browser Bundle. Install and run it. Go to http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php<br /><br />I have a harder time getting my pictures off my phone and onto my computer.<br /><br />Why not give the BBC listeners *that* information, and let them visit and make up their own minds, hmm?

				As I suspected, and CaptainWilly has confirmed, she has contacted multiple individuals to increase her chances of obtaining an interview. The journalist hasn&#039;t responded to me yet with the list of questions I requested so who knows if she&#039;ll even want to speak with me.<br /><br />I will say that I don&#039;t feel special in any way. In fact, me agreeing to it is closer to damage control than anything else. I will be very careful because I would never do anything that would jeopardize what we have going here.

				This&#039;ll end up on Radio4, probably an article on the Magazine section of the BBC website. <br /><br />It&#039;ll be a &#039;most read&#039;, article and the Daily Mail will latch onto it. <br /><br />There&#039;ll be outcry and moral panic from the middle Englanders. I can imagine the headlines: &#039;The site where YOUR children can buy deadly DRUGS- what every parent should know&#039;.<br /><br />There&#039;ll be questions in parliament. The left will be faux-outraged that the government is doing nothing. Cameron will have to be seen to be doing something about this affront to British values. <br /><br />On the plus side, this is an ideal time to buy some bitcoins.

				^^That&#039;s the current public opinion of SR.&nbsp; With a bit more publicity I think more people will see that this is one of the safest places to buy street drugs.<br /><br />Everyone within the SR community knows this place rules because we can discuss the quality of the products we&#039;re buying.&nbsp; It&#039;s about time the outside world gets enlightened on this fact.

				Yeah but mambosun, 99% of the non-drug using public have no idea about this site or read about it back in June and forgot all about it as it doesn&#039;t really concern them. Remember this isn&#039;t gawker or wired, this is the fucking BBC. <br />British tabloid journalism is a completely different kettle of fish than US news and they&#039;ll jump all over this story as they realise the BBC pipped them to reporting it first. <br /><br />There will be no objective reporting, the public won&#039;t formulate their own views. British society on the whole is stupid, uninformed and polarised. <br />Both right and left both have this &#039;something must be done&#039; attitude about every facet of life which isn&#039;t directly controlled and regulated and legislated against.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t think Silk Road should be some sort of secret, closed underground drug club but bad things could come of renewed publicity.<br />

				Hello,<br /><br />Sorry to contact you out of the blue like this.<br /><br />I am researching a programme about Silk Road for BBC Radio.<br /><br />I’m really interested in what attracts people to this website. I have read a lot of posts where people say they feel safer buying drugs online and that they like the idea of sellers being held accountable for the quality of the product.<br /><br />Some people have also written about being attracted to something that is beyond the control of the state.<br /><br />These are things that I would like to understand more about. Obviously I would like to talk to people, in confidence, on the telephone xx (x) xxx xxx xxxx. You could email me at xxxx.xxxxt@bbc.co.uk. If you are uncomfortable with that we could communicate on private message on this site.<br /><br />If you want to check out I am who I say I am you can Google my mail address. You will see that I’m disabled and you can get an idea of some of the programmes I’ve worked on.<br /><br />Best wishes and thanks for your help.<br />xxxx.xxxxtt<br />+ xx (x) xxx xxx xxxx<br /><br />Does this person seriously thing we are going to contact them?&nbsp; It would be suicide, your ass will be arrested ASAP and you will be &quot;pressured&quot; into revealing all.&nbsp; &nbsp;GMAIL????&nbsp; lol...and what does disability have to do with anything?

				- since the british government still have a lot of influence on what the bbc broadcast etc etc (just like any government) the bbc are used to broadcast politically hot-potatoes and i wouldn&#039;t trust any broadcaster that still has government connections (obvious)<br /><br />- also saying they from radio x investigasting / do a report on sounds a bit too inventive, so this is either a wind-up or this is purposely made out to be a non-important item to fill some news time but is actually the start of a full blown investigation. Don&#039;t forget the other youtube / &quot;spuiten en slikken&quot; thread here somewhere in the forum where the &quot;presenter&quot; buys drugs with an investigative journalist....etc..search for it.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				They meant the time in the UK is 11pm... GMT.<br />And just to add my opinion, in theory the BBC is meant to be impartial and un-bias as it&#039;s a government organisation which should be aimed at providing information not opinions. However this is Britain and nothing anywhere near this topic goes down well so I think it will just bring unwanted and negative attention to the site.

				Well i only found out about SR after an article about it appeared in one of this countries biggest newspapers. But the article was buried inside the Tech section.<br /><br />I would think it&#039;s not in the best interest of the media to name the site nor TOR as that will expose it to a whole heap of people which will make it even bigger to bust more people. <br /><br />And like most things in the 21st Century it&#039;s really hard to hide as it takes 1 or 2 people to expose this place to the media if they felt they have been scammed by a SR vendor.<br /><br />So let her do her story.

				Guys, just take a look at the wikipedia article on Silk Road: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)<br /><br />US Senators know about it, as does the DEA, it was even brought up during the recent SOPA hearings. In fact I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the journalist heard of SR through that. It even has the .onion address and a note that it requries tor. It&#039;s not exactly hidden.<br /><br />And may I remind everyone that the reason the value of bitcoin has spiked in the past has been due to exposure on Silk Road?

				I&#039;m still of Opinion that SR should be Closed off to a certain extent. I posted this elsewhere, Security I think..It&#039;s an Article/Blog on SR Infiltration. Let&#039;s say this Lizard person is a bored Troll. Cool. But what if??<br /><br />copy/pasted from <br />http://fskrealityguide.blogspot.com/2011/06/silk-road-was-partial-agoristbay.html<br /><br />Here&#039;s how Silk Road operated. You can only access the website via Tor. The only form of money accepted is Bitcoin. There was a seller feedback rating system. You would receive your drugs via mail.<br /><br />After the article and mainstream media publicity, Silk Road shut itself down to new users. I wonder how many DEA agents are Silk Road users?<br /><br />Here are the flaws in Silk Road&#039;s design:<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tor probably is not secure.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitcoin probably is not secure.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can only trade Anonymously.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is vulnerable to State infiltration.<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be both a seller feedback system and a buyer feedback system.<br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every buyer and seller should be visible to each other. You should only see other trustworthy users.<br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silk Road itself should be P2P organized, rather than having one central website.<br />Here&#039;s a more detailed explanation.<br /><br />1. Tor probably is not secure.<br /><br />I suspect that a large number of Tor exit nodes are run by the NSA/State.<br /><br />Stories like this one are interesting. Someone runs a Tor exit node. Police raid that person&#039;s home, saying he was &quot;downloading child pornography&quot;. The person shuts down his Tor exit exit node.<br /><br />This implies that State thugs are running all the Tor exit nodes. Here&#039;s the scam:<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See if anyone non-approved is operating a Tor exit node.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Download child pornography via their Tor exit node.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuse that person of a crime.<br />Notice how &quot;child pornography&quot; laws make it illegal for someone to operate a Tor exit node.<br /><br />With Tor, the &quot;exit nodes&quot; are a vulnerability. If all exit nodes are run by the State, that makes it very easy for State thugs to monitor Tor.<br /><br />State thugs have the resources to control most Tor nodes. The NSA may have put a backdoor encryption flaw in Tor. Tor is probably untrustworthy. I&#039;m very suspicious. State thugs crack down on anyone running a Tor exit node from their PC.<br /><br />Another downside of Tor is that Tor is *SLOW*!<br /><br />I did briefly experiment with Tor. I concluded that it was slow and probably NSA-controlled.<br /><br />2. Bitcoin is probably not secure.<br /><br />I already mentioned that I don&#039;t like Bitcoin. I&#039;ll review the main flaws in Bitcoin.<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every client has a copy of the full monetary base.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every client gets a copy of every transaction.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few people have a Bitcoin client on their PC. State thugs can see who&#039;s running Bitcoin, and add them to their &quot;subversive persons&quot; list.<br />Every client gets a copy of everything! That&#039;s like handing your records to the State! All State thugs have to do is run a Bitcoin client, and they get to see what every other Bitcoin user is doing!<br /><br />Bitcoin seems like an intentionally-flawed design.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like Bitcoin. I would accept bitcoins as payment, only if I could immediately trade them for FRNs or gold or silver.<br /><br />It was amusing that people accused me of pro-State trolling, for criticizing Bitcoin. Instead of addressing my concerns, they dismissed and ridiculed me. Is Bitcoin secretly run by the State? That is a pretty standard pro-State troll debating tactic, to ridicule someone without addressing their criticism.<br /><br />I own zero bitcoins. I have no incentive to promote Bitcoin. Suppose you own 1000 bitcoins. Then, you have an incentive to promote Bitcoin. If more people use Bitcoin, then your bitcoins become worth more.<br /><br />BTW, a simple arbitrage argument says &quot;value of a bitcoin&quot; should be close to &quot;cost of mining&quot;. Bitcoins can never be worth more than the cost of mining, because then more people would mine.<br /><br />If bitcoins were worth less than the cost of mining, then people would stop mining. If I were unethical, I could configure the servers at work to mine bitcoins at no cost to me. In that case, I&#039;d be mining bitcoins at no cost to myself.<br /><br />However, it is possible for bitcoins to be worth less than the mining cost. As an extreme example, if everyone stopped using bitcoin, then the value would go to zero, even though it would still cost electricity to mine more.<br /><br />Bitcoins can never be worth more than the cost of mining. They could be worth much less.<br /><br />3. You can only trade Anonymously.<br /><br />Silk Road is only useful for Anonymous transactions, especially selling drugs. Silk Road does not facilitate in-person transactions.<br /><br />You can&#039;t do the following on Silk Road:<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find a good unlicensed plumber/electrician/doctor<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find a good unlicensed restaurant<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buy raw milk<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trade State paper money for gold (but you probably could use bitcoins)<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find an off-the-books job<br />Silk Road is focused on destructive transactions, mainly drugs, rather than constructive transactions.<br /><br />I disagree with &quot;Certain drugs should be illegal.&quot; However, most drugs are harmful rather than beneficial.<br /><br />4. Silk Road is vulnerable to State infiltration.<br /><br />There almost definitely are some DEA agents and undercover police on Silk Road. It&#039;d be pretty easy to buy some LSD and then trace the package back to the source. Also, DEA agents may pose as sellers. Due to State law, if you&#039;re in possession of a certain quantity of a drug, you&#039;re treated as equivalent a seller.<br /><br />Once the DEA identifies a high-reputation user, they can say &quot;give us your account as part of a plea bargain&quot;. Once a high-trust account is compromised, Silk Road will completely unravel.<br /><br />5. There should be both a buyer and seller rating system. The buyer needs to trust the seller, to not cheat him. The seller needs to know that the buyer isn&#039;t an undercover policeman.<br /><br />Silk Road has insufficient protection against infiltration by the State.<br /><br />For example, a better system is &quot;You only get to join Silk Road if an existing user refers you.&quot; Even better, the person who refers you pledges to make a payment, if you turn out to be an undercover cop or otherwise break the trading network rules.<br /><br />6. Not every buyer and seller should be visible to each other. You should only see trustworthy people.<br /><br />It&#039;s much safer if you only see &quot;trusted partners&quot; rather than everyone. There should be a user referral system, where one person says &quot;I promise this person isn&#039;t an undercover cop.&quot;<br /><br />Of course, a &quot;user referral system&quot; only works once you have a certain number of users. If you&#039;re starting from zero customers, you need to advertise just to get started!<br /><br />7. Silk Road still is centralized. It&#039;s only one server hidden behind Tor. That&#039;s a vulnerability.<br /><br />Another precaution is to decentralize it in P2P fashion, rather than keep everything on one server. You don&#039;t get to see all transactions and sale offers, only those of people who trust you.<br /><br />Also, if Silk Road were decentralized P2P, then they could use their own encryption system rather than Tor. They could use their own internal accounting system rather than Bitcoin. They would allow pay-in and pay-out via any system. For example, you could send someone some bitcoins or mail someone an ounce of gold.<br /><br />Silk Road seems like a partial implementation of AgoristBay. It&#039;s a nice try. It still has some flaws.<br /><br />Silk Road has been outed by the mainstream media. Undercover State police have probably infiltrated it. If the site operator is smart, the most trustworthy users should move somewhere else and start over. I&#039;d avoid Tor and Bitcoin. I don&#039;t trust them.<br /><br />&quot;AgoristBay&quot; should use its own encryption and accounting system, and not rely on Tor or Bitcoin.<br /><br />Silk Road was an interesting partial implementation of &quot;AgoristBay&quot;. It was outed by the mainstream media, which makes it very risky now. Silk Road has definitely drawn the attention of the State. The most trustworthy Silk Road users should develop a better system and start over.<br />Posted by FSK at 12:00 PM&nbsp; <br /><br />

				the media are known for twisting the facts and misinformation, im sure theyll find a way to demonize it and portray it as some sort of horrific evil criminal underground, rather than a community of largely decent responsible people, no one here is &quot;peddled&quot; to, we all came here of our own free will and bought what we bought because we wanted it, usually fully aware of the associated risks with our preferred substances and should you not have that knowledge there are plenty of people here willing to help you out. with the exception of the odd scamming arsehole thats what people here are doing basically, just helping each other out, itd be nice if they just left us alone. people are always going to find ways to get hold of drugs, i did long before SR was ever about, but i have never got the purity, quality or the safety that i get buying here, so the only thing sr has changed really for me is my ability to get clean, quality drugs rather than what i can get my hands on by other means, like legal but very new RCs or &quot;pills&quot; with no description of the contents etc.<br /><br />havent had any pms myself but if i did i probably wouldnt be replying to them, as i said before the media has a fine record of twisting words, so if anyone does reply be very careful about what you say

				Hello,<br />Personally I am surprised of the discretion of the medias about Silk Road. In my country just a post on the blog of a newspaper in june, and that&#039;s all. <br /><br />A friend of mine asked me details about SR last week, I thought he wanted to know how it works for his personnal use because he enjoyed the coke I ordered from SR ! But in fact he wanted to get some informations for a friend who works for a TV channel so I just told him he could find those informations by himself.<br /><br />But I realized SR was a golden subject for reporters : illegal drugs, Internet, public will love this combination ! In my opinion you can prepare yourself to be flood of reports about SR in all kind of medias very soon, just a question of weeks...<br /><br />WL

				I don&#039;t think SR should be &quot;closed off&quot; to the public, but being close to a few journalists myself I would say stay the hell away from this person. Big time media (BBC, ABC, Faux News, etc.) are all manipulated by LE or other dangerous third parties to some extent. I suppose there&#039;s nothing wrong with answering opinionated questions (i.e. why do you use SR?), but please, don&#039;t give away anything that would even remotely compromise anyone&#039;s security.<br /><br />Most of the people in that business will do anything for a buck.

				Her questions are about the motivation to use the website, why vendors sell here, is this the manifestation of a visionary ideal or just a new way to procure illicit substances. I provided my opinions and not much more.<br /><br />I&#039;m inclined to believe that she is a legit journalist.<br /><br />She asked nothing about how Silk Road is run or anything suspicious at all.

				I am honestly torn between the idea of promoting more public awareness of SR and attempting to stay out of the lime-lite. It is a double edged sword.<br /><br />Remember the Utah USA polygamist &quot;Warren Jeffs?&quot; He was around for years doing what he enjoyed and believed in, and not until he appeared on TV, thrusting himself into the lime-lite by publicizing his beliefs, was he pursued and eventually brought down by the authorities. Before he went public, they all knew about him but had many other more important issues to deal with.<br /><br />There is a distinct line between gaining strength slowly through word-of-mouth and brazenly splashing what you are doing in the public arena. Was in not the June 2011 expose that lead to the fraud resulting in the BitCoin crash?

				This is in no way a good idea. I doubt this story goes anywhere unless she gets actual responses from a person. There have already been stories on SR so thats been done and theres nothing new there. It sounds like she looking for the &quot;human element&quot; to the story, the faces behind the screen names. Without that i doubt this story goes anywhere. And people who are saying theres nothing new she cant learn from already reading the posts here and using those. Well i highly doubt she could use posts as opinions, there&#039;s just no real context to posts; u cant tell for sure if someone is being sarcastic, a troll, or just being stupid. Shes not going to be able to quote random posts from a forum and use those as actual responses. Yes there is a wiki about SR and we know that the government does know about this site but that doesnt mean everyone who could do real damage here knows about it. All we need is a story about SR to come out and have some advocacy group or some D.A.R.E nut cases to start doing research and find out that LE is aware of us and has infact not done anything about it or at least look like its not. This just gives these people even more of a reason to start a huge stink about SR, make it look like LE is not doing its job and is just allowing a site to sell drugs to anyone who has the coin. The pressure for action would just increase like crazy and because there are only a handful of sites like this it would give them even more reason to shut SR down asap, before the idea spreads out of control. No good could come from this.

				I think publicity would help SR - I would have never heard of it if I hadn&#039;t been searching for it so hard. There are so many people out there who would love this site, but they don&#039;t even know it exists.&nbsp; Getting drugs is hard in my small whitetrash town, and I sympathize for those in similar situations.<br />I once heard that congress tried contacting the SR administrator once. If they already know it exists, what have you got to lose by getting it in he media a little more?

				OK, so i also was contacted by this woman going by Lizard, I&#039;m sure she&#039;s following these threads. anyway she legit as far as who she is, she&#039;s part of a a podcast from the UK called &quot;ouch&quot; for disabled ppl??? yeah i don&#039;t no? anyway! i told her i would get back to her via forums and let her know after checking her out? my opinion is, I being new for one and also don&#039;t think i can talk for a whole community? i will tell her why I&#039;m here but no more. I hate a good thing going away. I really like the community here:) i think the first thing one should say about SR is there is no SR. we are and should be Anonymous! in my humble opinion .....peace

				I would look at it with the &quot;Ron Paul&quot; model in mind.<br /><br />The media has done everything it could for the last 30 years to undermine his message and his supporters in every imaginable way.<br />At every step of the game he quietly stuck to his position......personal liberty and sound economics.<br />Never in 30 years, even when running for president, has he changed his tune. He HAS had to learn the setup questions for which there are no sound byte answers....(Do you plan to stop beating your wife?) but never has he allowed himself to change his position or be drawn into an animated rant when goaded. (This is particular ammusing in a time when those running against him are scrambling to reinvent themselves...again &quot;) )<br /><br />This patient strategy has finally put him in a position where all of the eye-rolling (McCain in 08) and &quot;He&#039;s crazy&quot; (look how everyone is borrowing from his small government, sound money talk...even though they don&#039;t really mean it), and &quot;Ron Who?&quot; tactics no longer work.<br /><br />The ass-bags hosting &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and &quot;Meet the Press&quot; have finally had to acknowledge his presence, downplaying it and throwing questioned designed to make him look bad to neocons (Face the nation) or to look as though even he doesn&#039;t think he has a chance (Meet the press).<br />He held his own with a coolness that we all here need to learn if ever interviewed.<br /><br />We need to know EXACTLY what we are for, what is the root of the problem that drives us here instead of Walmart, and be able to articulate this understanding in a way that won&#039;t let them rattle us even if they start making mama slurs.<br /><br />A few dozen of those going public and you will begin to see a very frightened press, DOJ, Congress and President alike. Well, not the president......he will be Ron Paul!<br /><br />They HAVE to be able to marginalize us, make us look like our average is on par with the lowest crack head. From what I read in here that will be very difficult indeed. We are smart. We just need to stay disciplined under fire and scare the shit out of them.<br /><br />

				If people saw how well organized SR is and how the people get along fine for the most part (at least with the sellers I&#039;ve dealt with) it may change their opinion of the whole drug community. Change the image from a thug group to a healthy economical society whose members mostly show respect and common courtesy for eachother. Honestly the people I&#039;ve dealt with on this website seem nicer than most people at my high school. If only the media would accept that fact.

				Leave SR in the dark, or atleast as dark as it is currently. <br /><br />I may be wrong, but I think most of the major media pieces were some time ago. <br /><br />And the shockwaves &amp; tremors from those have passed.<br /><br />&nbsp;i.e. increased LE focus (not that there isn&#039;t constant presence), newbies who don&#039;t read forums or follow proper protocol (then bitch about getting ripped off), mass influx to community = skyrocketing BTC prices....<br /><br />Who wants any of this?<br /><br />Not me, and its definitely not good for SR as a whole.<br /><br /><br />ps no offense BP....but....using Ron Paul as an example is pointless for an international community like SR, when nobody gives a fuck about him in our own country....

				Wow, people are acting like fools...<br /><br />You realize that the people who run this site absolutely love the publicity?<br /><br />Who do you think tipped off gawker in the first place?<br /><br />Silk Road has already been brought up to the DEA by a US Senator (Chuck Schumer). He made a big stink about how it needs to be shut down. There was a bunch of press. And then (I&#039;m assuming), some technical person pulled him aside and pointed out &quot;Hey, there really is nothing we can do to take this site down through official channels...and if there was, we&#039;d be going after the child porn long before the drug users.&quot;<br /><br />After that, there was a near-total media blackout on the issue of Silk Road for a few months. The thought being, if we can&#039;t shut it down, at least we can try to keep it from being publicized even further. But the cat is out of the bag. You can&#039;t put it back in. This is a known site. Known by law enforcement, known by media, known by politicians, known by scammers...known by fucking wikipedia. <br /><br />But somehow people are demonizing other people for giving interviews? You realize that there was an article in Rolling Stone about Silk Road a couple of weeks ago?<br /><br />Some of the people in this community are amazing...very well spoken, intelligent people giving back and building a community. And then there are a bunch of paranoid asshats who think that now that they have arrived, let&#039;s stop other people from arriving so that they will be special.<br /><br />Those people are the &quot;fucking twats&quot;, if you ask me.

				&nbsp;:-X :-X :-X :-X :-X :-X :-X :-X :-X :-X<br /><br />I will begin and end with a quote from two different people...you can judge all you like but I know where I stand in this battle...<br /><br />“Some of the press who speak loudly about the freedom of the press are themselves the enemies of freedom. Countless people dare not say a thing because they know it will be picked up and made a song of by the press. That limits freedom.” By: ~Geoffrey Fisher<br /><br />Dear Big mouthed people, I am speaking my opinion on why we need to stop people from making an even bigger stink about us. Clearly you may not understand that the more people talk about this community the more likely we won&#039;t have a community to come back to. There is this thing that the senate does from time to time called &quot;Passing a bill&quot;, and one of those &quot;Bills&quot; is for passing laws to shut down &quot;Rogue Websites&quot;, if you don&#039;t think we are in any danger of losing our special community then you are wrong brother. If there isn&#039;t a way for them to shut us down now, they will certainly find a way or they will make a fucking way, we are talking about the government. We face the probability of losing every single fucking day, and this is a &quot;Special&quot; place whether you think so or not, and I am sure everyone here will agree with me when I say that it is special. No paranoia, just truth. Another thing before I go, as far as that comment about people&nbsp; who aren&#039;t &quot;well spoken or intelligent&quot; you are mistaken. Try reading some other posts of mine before you make some stupid ass statement like that. I guess people who use the word twat aren&#039;t intelligent, I suppose I haven&#039;t given anything to the community here, you are a sad excuse for a &quot;friendlyoutlaw&quot;. How about standing up with us, together, as a community citizen and fight the man and the media and the press, how about not conforming and giving in, how about not becoming a fucking sheep. Let me ask you, with all of those 27 posts that you have made and that newbie status of yours (just like mine) how much have you contributed? Have you made donations? Have you made any purchases? Or are you just a fucking forum troll? Yes we want more people to be here, we want our community to grow, we want to be free, we want unity and respect, we want peace, but all of those things could very well be down the tubes...the people who will bring us down are the ones that we do not want here. The people who do not belong here, like LE, press, media...all part of the propaganda machine that will take aim at us and tell the rest of the world how we are terrible scum of the earth, a community of liars, thieves and junkies. We do not want them here, and people like you, who stand up for publicity, press, media, and LE are the same type of people who will bring us down. Those are the same people who do not know how to protect something that is special or sacred. I would love to SR get absolutely huge, unlimited growth, unlimited money...but this will turn into a witch hunt...and those who couldn&#039;t control their tongue are the ones who should be at the stake, but instead, they will unknowingly be sponsoring the ones who wish to hurt us. You are a fool to think that the government will not do something about us at some point, whether it is outlawing .onion sites or something to that affect. I am trying to prolong our life, not cut it short by <br /><br />~LP<br /><br />Post Script - President Obama just signed the Defense Bill...just one step closer to martial law. If you don&#039;t know what I am talking about then you need to go look it up on google. What a crock of shit. Because of this bill we could all be considered terrorists and thrown in prison not to be heard from ever again. WAKE UP EVERYONE. Pull the wool from your eyes. <br /><br />I suppose our friendlyoutlaw support this bill too...asshat.<br /><br />One of my most favorite quotes of all time is...<br />&quot;Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.&quot;<br />By: ~Martin Luther King<br />But sometimes you just gotta know when to shut your mouth...so shut your mouth Unfriendly Outlaw<br /><br />And VJ, I know you mean well, but you really shouldn&#039;t side with this outlaw douche lol I know you have more brains than that.&nbsp; :D<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:-X :-X :-X

				@friendlyoutlaw i agree with most of what you say, but the thing is everyone&#039;s interest differs, which is why this is an endless debate. <br />Like it was already said, there is this rule with the authorities that the more publicity there is for that sort of things, the more they will need to act against it. <br />Police work is just a matter of priority in regards with the impact/damage to the public. Once they get thousands of complaints from parents that see there child exposed to SR cause it&#039;s so advertised everywhere, they will need to take actions. And we can&#039;t be naive enough to think that they can&#039;t do anything about it: I&#039;m not sure banning onion addresses is technically possible and i think there will always be a way to bypass such actions cause the very goal of the IP protocol was go past that kind of things, but they can simply harden the controls at post offices. The technology keeps getting better; you may be aware that the ban on liquids in airplanes has been raised for example recently in EU thanks to new scanning technologies.<br />The thing is, it&#039;s a bit selfish but everyone has it&#039;s own interest:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />- SR admin: do they get a percentage on the sells? if yes then I agree with you the publicity may be good for them on the short term, although it&#039;s a big risk on the long term.<br />- the buyer who is low on money: he may want some publicity hoping that the prices will go down with competition<br />- the buyer who isn&#039;t low on money: he won&#039;t want publicity cause it might increase the risk and he may be very happy as it is<br />- the seller who isn&#039;t selling much may want publicity to have more customers<br />- the seller who is already overwhelmed has nothing to gain with publicity<br /><br />So let&#039;s not daemonize ppl who want publicity but let&#039;s not call the others twats either! :)<br />Ppl just need to think about what they do/say and what the consequences may be. That said, there&#039;s no stopping them from spreading the news if they want to;<br />On the long run, I think like LesbianRobot that it&#039;s best to go safe and keep it as underground as possible; grow slowly, only talk about it to friends... but we can&#039;t really expect everyone to act for the greater good, can we?

				The best fucking thing in the world for me right now is the status quo.<br /><br />I mean, look around - I have it fucking made in the shade here!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been eying up Silk Road since long before Gawker (was Badger Copter on the old forums&nbsp; ;) ) and was waiting for the market depth to get to the point that I could jump in, which I only did about 6 weeks ago.<br /><br />And ain&#039;t nobody gonna touch me now - not in the seed biz - not if things remain along the path they&#039;re currently taking.&nbsp; No surface web seedbank is going to come down here - they&#039;d have jackboots knocking on their door in hours. Nobody is going to go drop 1/2 mil on seed stock and compete with me head to head, and if they don&#039;t drop that kind of cash then they can never compete with me on price and stock on hand for same day shipping.<br /><br />But I didn&#039;t take my retirement fund and invest it in seeds to sell here to make another retirement fund.<br /><br />I&#039;m here to break the back of prohibition, to make the jack-booted thugs from the DEA roll up their tents and sneak off into the night, and to do what I can to ensure a future where 65 year old MS patients aren&#039;t shot by SWAT teams during drug raids because they suspect there was a fucking plant growing in the back room.<br /><br />I&#039;m here to help create a Silk Road where I have dozens of competitors, all safely hidden from the authorities, and fighting me for every customer and sale.<br /><br />I&#039;m here to be involved with what&#039;s going to become an unstoppable force that can work to break the ties that governments use to bind us.<br /><br />Hell, I&#039;ll pay an extra 5% commission to Silk Road to go towards taking out a full page advertisement in the New York Times (cause when you do that, even CNN covers it - xxx took out a full page ad in the NYT today...) that simply says:<br /><br /><br />The answer to the drug war: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br /><br />Stop all this bullshit talk about don&#039;t let the authorities know. Fuck, they know already - every Three Letter Agency out there knows about Silk Road.<br /><br />And there&#039;s not a single fucking thing they can do about it. PGP, tor and bitcoin, they may evolve in the future, but that genie is never going back in the bottle. Every fucking night I say a prayer of thanks to Phil Zimmerman for that - and so should you, cause it&#039;s his work that it&#039;s all based upon. (And I&#039;ll add here that the US government classified Phils work as &#039;munitions&#039; and made it illegal to pass it on or publish it. What did Phil do? He fucking posted it all over the web, risking arrest for treason to do so! But it&#039;s just math, and once it was out there, ain&#039;t no going back. We&#039;re here today, because Mr. Zimmerman has huge brass balls, and choose widespread publicity over closely held secrets.)<br /><br />So yeah - the authorities already know - but to break the back of prohibition we have to make sure everyone else knows as well.<br /><br />More publicity. More customers. More competition. A true free market. No interference possible by supposed &#039;Authorities&#039;.<br /><br />And I&#039;m all for that.<br /><br />And Phil, if you&#039;re out there - free cannabis seeds for life, my friend. You&#039;re one of my heros.

				VJ, this was never meant to be an attack, after my first post I was immediately chastised for wanting to keep us quiet, and rightfully so, I made an opinion based on someone talking to the press. What would you do if someone told the police that you were buying and selling dope? What would you do if they tipped them off, or tipped off a local newspaper about your drug habit??? It is not fucking cool. Period. There is a reason you don&#039;t go tell the police right after you blew a big fat line of coke, and you do not run to the fed when you get a new drug dealer and you finally got to go to his house instead of having your friend go into his house alone and no one else is allowed. We face the fact that what we do is illegal and we take big risks yes. But don&#039;t think for a second that if the cops in your area got their hands on a list of people buying and selling a bunch of dope in their area they wouldn&#039;t do something about it.

Smart dealers don&#039;t want to meet new people. It&#039;s drilled into you as soon as you get into the scene.<br /><br />It&#039;s like the scene in Men in Black where Will Smith is going to work for the first day, and Tommy Lee Jones tells him that all the stuff he&#039;s learned so far, doesn&#039;t mean Jack shit anymore.<br /><br />Kinda the same thing here - the old metrics don&#039;t apply - hell, they don&#039;t NEED to apply.<br /><br />Can you get your head around that?<br /><br />If not, where am I losing you at?<br /><br />Is it simply a case of survival instincts honed IRL flowing over into this situation?

				One thing I think people are forgetting here is that on average, individuals are pretty careful about their own security, which is all that matters here - not what everyone else is doing.<br /><br />My clients are a perfect example of that.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been selling here about six weeks now, though I&#039;ve been here basically since the beginning.<br /><br />Do you see any threads about me?<br /><br />There was one about a month ago, guy posted asking if anyone dealt with me, and it died for lack of responses.<br /><br />Yet here I am, screaming along and it won&#039;t be long till I crack the top 10 for vendors here, and you still won&#039;t see a review thread.<br /><br />That&#039;s because my customers face a far different threat model than the other customers on this board. They might be willing to offer an opinion of someone they bought some weed off of, and next week offer another opinion on a RC vendor. So the weed vendor knows he bought RCs, and the RC vendor knows he bought a gram of weed. Not a lot of threat there.<br /><br />But telling someone you bought seeds - that&#039;s a whole &#039;nother ball of wax. It&#039;s not like that gram of weed you bought that was gone by Saturday, nosiree. Nope, someone who bought seeds is pretty much likely to be wanting to grow those things out, and posting a review tells any unscrupulous vendor they&#039;ve dealt with that now they don&#039;t have an address for someone who bought a gram of weed, they now have an address for someone that bought enough seeds to grow pounds of weed.<br /><br />It also means that for every sale I get, I usually exchange 8 - 10 PM&#039;s with my clients - for EVERY order, answering the questions that any other vendor would be asked in a thread. And even more PMs with potential clients who haven&#039;t purchased yet. Over 1,600 PMs received and sent last week, and the week before almost as many, and nary a whisper on the forums.<br /><br />Cause my clients may be stoners, but they&#039;re not stupid, and they know the threat model they operate under is different than most customers here, and govern themselves accordingly.<br /><br />So yeah, I don&#039;t have a problem with the press here at all. Sure, they&#039;ll twist shit around and make it look evil and bad and decadent, but who cares? For every few people sitting around tsk-tsk&#039;ing over the site, there&#039;s gonna be one or two that slip home and google &#039;tor&#039; and &#039;silk road&#039; because in this case there is no such thing as bad publicity.<br /><br />And it won&#039;t hurt a soul on these boards.<br /><br />It&#039;s also why I&#039;m dead set against these threads on here calling out buyers by vendors - bringing to the attention of possibly unscrupulous vendors the purchases of clients who&#039;s information should remain sacrosanct.<br /><br />Want to improve security here on the Silk Road?<br /><br />Instantly ban and freeze the accounts of any vendor who mentions a client without that client first bringing the relationship public. Give the funds to the outed party. Client information, including the fact that they are even a client, is something every vendor should hold in the greatest regard.<br /><br />Client wants to bitch about a vendor? Got to town, and the vendor can respond.<br /><br />Vendor outs a client purchase, or even that they are a client, for any reason whatsoever, ban-hammer the ignorant cunt, permanently. Oh hooey, Stan gave me a 4/5, so I&#039;m gonna spread his name around and form a cartel to boycott him. No, what you&#039;re doing is debasing the trust your clients gave you, and it&#039;s people like that we can do without, not BBC Radio reporters.

				Ok, I&#039;m a first time poster, but everyone has to start somewhere - I&#039;ve been watching for a while and felt I have something to offer here.<br /><br />First of all, I&#039;m a buyer not a seller, and I like SR because I favour quality. I&#039;m also from the UK and no doubt like most countries buying face to face is risky unless even if you have good suppliers, and their quality is still variable. SR is not going to reduce the amount I spend, just where I spend it.<br /><br />I&#039;m also a professional in the IT industry, not that my colleagues know about my bad habits, so I have more to lose. I came across Silk Road recently in a Wired article that mentioned the Gawker link, so checked it out. I&#039;d mention that we run a couple of Tor nodes. providing about 20Mb/sec , so not every point is LEO based. Shame that we cant make a few BTC for so public a service but such is life.<br /><br />First the BBC researcher - I know a few BBC staff, they employ a lot of freelancers now (although that doesnt mean she isnt full time for 5Live). Radio 5 Live is potentially one of the more liberal stations, an article about SR wouldn&#039;t generate much&nbsp; interest, maybe a few new users, but it might get picked up by the conservative press who will see it as an opportunity to howl about drugs destroying our society. We are talking about the same people who have been making a fuss since cannabis was effectively decriminalised for personal amounts, and they have been merrily ignored for several years.<br /><br />Don&#039;t discount that the disability in question may be MS - some THC based medication is available nowadays but the couple of sufferers I know suggest it is much easier to obtain suitable medication on the black market, might be what brought SR to this researchers attention. Also the BBC like to employ &quot;disabled people&quot;, as a publicly funded body they have to demonstrate that they make the effort to be as fair as possible.<br /><br />Perhaps more usefully, I have a friend who works for the &quot;Foreign Office&quot;, but oddly seems to go to work at Thames House, which is some way from the FO - you can work that one out :)&nbsp; As far as they are concerned 9/11 was the best thing that happened as their funding went stratospheric overnight, but drugs arent their focus. Seems the fundamentalist Islamic groups are the #1 priority and they dont take much funding from the drug trade. The world recession is working in our favour too, small shipments of anything dodgy just arent a priority at the border, the cost required to track a reseller who may not be arrestable even&nbsp; so means the details get logged and passed onto the local police force, just make sure you arent know to them for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />I believe that SR tries to keep under the LEO radar, not turning into a bazaar for cartels shipping large amounts of product, then it wont generate too much interest, they all have to demonstrate value for money nowadays. Manchester police had a policy 20 years ago that you had to score enough points (based on drug sales turnover, violence etc) before you qualified for active investigation. I imagine the same is applied by most departments nowadays, why go after people shipping a few thousand pounds of product each month compared to those who import tons at a time. The whole principle behind the site also pretty much restricts it to those of a certain intelligence level, who are unlikely to do anything really stupid that generates news headlines. News articles aren&#039;t much good when everyone involved is &quot;anonymous of unknown country&quot;.<br /><br />Please feel free to let me know if I&#039;m doing anything daft :)

				If goes all way public with adds in all the newspapers it will not be a healthy progresion or growth of the customer base in SR it will be to fast for new sellers to come up. <br />But one video in you tube (that how i hear about it) one day, the next month an article in some newspaper. If is a steady healthy growth i think my simplistic logic works. And one day, who knows maybe the objetive is to force the end of prohibition of drugs in the world and to get most of our individual freedoms back. BLOODY HELL we are in the 21 century and we dont have euthanasia law, we have PROHIBITION in place that is making millions of people suffer phissically and economically.

				What do you care how much they money they make here. Dont you pay anywhere for services that companies provide you? Here is the same thing they provide us with a service,&nbsp; they spend time and resources to run it. And as a bonus add it,&nbsp; they may risk their freedom for it. So do you think your freedom is worth 10000$ a day?. You can sell drugs in the corner and make 10000 dollars a day is a very good profit.

I also agree with a lot of points oppyate made earlier.<br /><br />SR can&#039;t continue forever the way it is. It just won&#039;t last as a centralized hub for drug buying. It should definitely be more P2P oriented. I suppose its because the guys who run SR want to make a profit too. But I mean, whats to stop me from making my own site - where its invite only, invites are based on rep, the site would be more of a forum for reviewing vendors and their wares, not actually facilitating any transactions. No escrow, but hey, that&#039;s what rep is for, and I think taking a chance not using escrow with someone who is well known and respected is much less risky than most drug deals that go down in person.<br /><br />Really though, why don&#039;t some of the more well known-vendors and long-time, respectable buyers start venturing out on our own? Maybe just start with a mailing list (email), pgp only of course. That&#039;s a good starting point for continuing to do what we do outside of SR IMHO. For example, people know I sell tar, so they can just pgp email me their order information. Why not?<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />JD2012

				Fuck this shit I would never give any info to a reporter. They are just looking for a story to twist into whatever they want their viewers to think. Why even take a chance with something like this. SK has changed a lot in the world and we&#039;re all grateful for it and for the most part happy with how it is now so why even take the risk of telling a &quot;reporter&quot; of all people what goes on in SK maybe im wrong but Im super fucking paranoid about every single thing I do on here even with all the security so to go and tell a reporter??? It just seems logical to me but many people have been on here way longer than me so maybe I am wrong.

We&#039;ll come back, tell &#039;em what fun we had and say that it was only possible with the help of good ol&#039; Silk Road.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to tell them anything, tell them how great it is and why you think so.<br />Choose your words carefully. If you can&#039;t do that, don&#039;t speak at all!<br /><br />Governments already know about Silk Road... Why hide it&#039;s word any longer?<br />We need publicity, good publicity. Start a movement. Put the creation of this magical place to use.<br />We will stand, not to fight, to love.
