				You probably won&#039;t find it. Chargebacks keep people from offering it. To be honest, you don&#039;t want to buy your BTC like that anyway

I presume you don&#039;t have a WoT rating, therefore making this option impossible.<br /><br />I would suggest that you search the forums for one of the many &quot;How to get Bitcoin&quot; threads - you&#039;re guaranteed to find a method which is available in your country.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Ok. <br /><br />I found a site, a canadian one, like I am and I just hope they won&#039;t scam me. I&#039;ll try 20 $ and see. <br />They take the money sent by mail.

				What&#039;s the name of the site? If it&#039;s canadianbitcoins.com then you have nothing at all to worry about, they&#039;re excellent! Just make sure you hide the cash well in the envelope.

				VirWox lets you purchase Lindendollars for traditional currency using Paypal.&nbsp; You can then trade your lindendollers, also on virwox, for BTC.&nbsp; You cannot buy BTC directly with Paypal.&nbsp; They also make you wait some number of days to withdraw the coins, to prevent chargebacks.<br /><br />So you use Paypal to put dollars into your VirWox account.&nbsp; Then trade the dollars for LindenDollars, then trade the L$ for BTC.&nbsp; Then wait # days, then withdraw them.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying coins using a credit card, but if you are careful to mix them well after withdrawing, and patient enough to wait, then it shouldn&#039;t be a problem.

				Have you tried coinbase.com ?&nbsp; I used it the other day.&nbsp; You do have to give them your bank info. <br />&nbsp;It works but I am waiting a long time for my first purchase to clear , they do let you know the day it will be out of pending. I purchased some bitcoins via moneypak during the wait. I used Sugarmama and she came through with my first bitcoins the next day.
