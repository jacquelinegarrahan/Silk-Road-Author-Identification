				So I placed an order for 2 different items with a very reputable vendor. When I checked my order status, only one item was marked in transit, while the other says processing still.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the item that says processing is no longer listed by the vendor, but I would think if he didn&#039;t have anymore he would have told me when he marked the other item in transit or cancelled it.<br /><br />Another thing worth mentioning, the item marked in transit was well below the vendors &quot;minimum order&quot; requirement and also had the &quot;combine shipping&quot; option for when you order more than one item.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m assuming he just forgot to mark the other in transit but since I&#039;m ignorant to the vendor process, is there any reason a vendor would mark one in transit and leave the other as processing?

				How long has it been? Give it at least a few days before worrying.<br /><br />Why not send him a friendly message inquiry?

				Oh I&#039;m not worried. I&#039;ve bought from him in the past, it just seemed odd.<br /><br />I actually wrote him a message last night when I ordered about something unrelated that he hasn&#039;t read or responded to, figured sending another would just clog up his box. It appeared he was away for the weekend so probably had a lot of catching up to do.<br /><br />Just seemed weird, wasn&#039;t sure I&#039;d there was a rhyme or reason or if its normal.vendor practice / part of the SR order processing, etc.

				Just because he does not list the item anymore does not mean he ran out on you.<br /><br />If I have 5 balloons and sell 4 of them then I have 1 remaining.<br /><br />You come along and buy the 1.&nbsp; What happens? The listing disappears.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				Didn&#039;t realize it was automated like that by quantity. Though the vendor was in charge of keeping track of quantity and then taking down listings. SR is more programmed and automated than it looks I guess!
