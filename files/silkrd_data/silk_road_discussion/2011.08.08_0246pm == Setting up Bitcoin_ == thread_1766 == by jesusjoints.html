				Nope<br /><br />You need to find a money account like Dwolla, transfer money to it.<br />Which takes days.<br />Then find a Bitcoin trader. <br />Transfer the money to it, which takes an hour or two.<br />Then you need to more it to SR.<br />Now I am reading you should more your bitcoins around before moving them to SR.<br /><br />I am seeing bitcoin trading is tricky as well.<br /><br />Chronicpain is correct. do some searching, plenty of threads on the subject.<br />Plenty of places to get ripped off too.

				Couple of ways to go about it. If you have and established online rep, such as high ebay fb, you may be able to get an account at Bitmarket. Some traders allow you to pay with paypal. Most others allow Moneybookers, which is similar and you can set up in a few mins. Bitmarket coins are always above market rate but when you need coins quick it&#039;s the go. Dwolla ain&#039;t gonna happen for someone in Oz, which is where you are as your previous posts suggest.<br />If in Oz, you can d/d at the NAB to MT Gox a/c and you will have the BTC in about 3-4 days. This works OK so long as you don&#039;t want to sell the BTC and take cash from Mt Gox. You are also exposed to BTC fluctuation should you do this.<br />Have a look at the bitcoin.org forums for some more info.

				Since you won&#039;t look around and spend some time reading. Ill give you a hint.. www.bitcoinmarket.cc thats about as fast as you can get without going dwolla-mt.gox-wallet-sr<br /><br />They don&#039;t do paypal but they do moneypak. you can have your btc&#039;s probably within hours...

				Take a look at this thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1393.0<br /><br />Pay close attention to Profspudhed&#039;s posts.&nbsp; He&#039;s got a method that can get you bitcoins in a hurry. If you live in the States you&#039;ll have to modify things just a bit (the first step is to buy a Ukash card, which we can&#039;t get here), but go to the Neteller website and you&#039;ll see there are plenty of other funding options.&nbsp; Neteller supposedly isn&#039;t available for residents of the States, but you can just create a fake name and a fake address in another country.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming they don&#039;t verify your address...<br /><br />Anyway, a few more steps and you&#039;re on your way to getting Bitcoins.&nbsp; 8)

				In the future PLEASE read other&#039;s thread first. We do not need 50 post about how to set up BTC. Google is your friends. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
