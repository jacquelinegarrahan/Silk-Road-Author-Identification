				You could pay a hobo some bucks to cash out for you.<br />Otherwise you&#039;d need fake IDs etc.

				Now you are making me feel old.<br /><br />He was one of SR&#039;s most respected vendors, and he was undone, because WU in Canada actively reports transactions they find &quot;suspicious&quot; to LE no matter the amount/frequency. They also participate in very real racial profiling.
