				The problem is this.<br /><br />I have a whole lot of really really cool ideas that I&#039;d like to share with the forum. Game changers even.<br /><br />But I can&#039;t do it. <br /><br />I can&#039;t because if LEO is looking at the forum, which is likely, then it creates problems for me. :&#039;(<br /><br />It sucks. It means the majority of my ideas I share have to be really vague or just impossible for LEO to capitalize on.<br />Whereas many of the most useful ideas we have are actually very specific kinds of information.<br /><br />Wat do SR?

				Is the problem created specifically for you because you&#039;re the poster?<br /><br />If you want it out for discussion, PM some SR member and ask them them post it.&nbsp; That is also a good initial check on whether or not it really is a good idea, or if it just seems so in you head.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have lots of ideas that sound great between my ears, but don&#039;t play out so well in IRL.<br /><br />Or just PM some of the SR and other senior members that you think will get it.&nbsp; Again, it it&#039;s a good idea, they will know what to do with it.

				Come up with your own cipher and encrypt the key to it using PGP. create a new account (only after using a new Tor identity after every key press),&nbsp; send&nbsp; to the admin from a VM inside a VM that is encrypted and set to automatically erase using a Gutmann 30+ pass wipe pattern upon shut down.<br /><br />That&#039;s my suggestion.

				If you&#039;re worried about LEO, the idea isn&#039;t that great after all. Imagine if you came up with the idea of SilkRoad. You would implement it knowing that there ain&#039;t much LEO can do about it if you&#039;re smart and careful. <br /><br />My advice, instead of cypher-crytping and all that other unnecessary jazz, is to rethink your idea. Then come back and post it. We&#039;ll be all the better for it.

				Could you post your secret ideas using PGP and your own public key?&nbsp; Then, the forum members here can create a PGP cracking algorithm so that we can extract your good ideas.&nbsp; To do the cracking, we&#039;ll use a network of computers, where every computer mine&#039;s a portion of your plan, contributing 2 Ghash/s of processing power.
