				Try adding to cart, if there are any shipping fees it&#039;ll be listed in the postage pull down menu, then you can update to see your total. Unless it&#039;s stated in the description or some buyer feedback, you probably won&#039;t get anything unexpected. Could always PM the vendor to make sure though.

				oh thanks :)<br /><br />so one item has a fee and the other has no options in the pull down menu for postage. so basically there are no postage fees?

				This is nothing against Mito because he is a very known and trusted member of SR, but Netherlands are generally terrible to order from since it is the most scrutinized when it comes to your country.

I can understand you&#039;re eager to make a purchase but whether you do it today or tomorrow (or even on Monday) it&#039;ll be mailed out at the same time.
