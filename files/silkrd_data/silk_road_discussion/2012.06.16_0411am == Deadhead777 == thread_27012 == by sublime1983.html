				What this guy says just astonishes me. I package everyone&#039;s envelope the same and vacuum seal everyone&#039;s product. How the fuck could someone puncture a hole in your envelope? because that is the only way that could of happened. And before I read your messages you say&quot;, see what happens when you dont want to do the right thing.&quot; It&#039;s like why should I do anything when your blackmailing me?<br /><br />I don&#039;t do drugs during the morning and especially when making packages...so you can&#039;t fool me when you say the top was sealed. I know what I did and there is no way anything could of fell out lol.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Dh

				im not saying i don&#039;t believe you because anything CAN happen, but what deadhead says is right. this sounds like a common way for people to try and get free product. and when dealing with an extremely addictive drug such as heroin you would be surprised the lengths people go to.
