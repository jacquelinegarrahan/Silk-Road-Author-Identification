				Hello all:D<br />Now as some of you may of seen or know,I&#039;m a new vendor on SR only been here for a couple of weeks.I have made some good friendships and already a few loyal customers.Most would say I should be happy,which I am on that part but there&#039;s also another part that&#039;s getting me really down.<br />I always try to keep happy and share love,but why do I have some who just seem to now target me/vendors so to speak?It&#039;s like there&#039;s a small disease on this forum that needs to be eradicated completely...I don&#039;t know whether you&#039;d call them trollers,drug addicts or just plain spoilt!It started off when I gave out some free samples to customers,I had a couple of people on here and SR literally hassling me for a sample.They made it sound so urgent every time like they needed a kidney transplant or something:(Since this has begun I&#039;ve noticed that there is a select group on here that go about hassling for every free sample going and some actually get shitty when told no.It&#039;s depressing.They blame ME for not wanting to give them free weed after hassling,and to top it off negative rep you just because they think they can have the final say---what they don&#039;t seem to realise is I&#039;m the one with the weed sample still and they&#039;re not:DAnd you have the other ones who just come on here and shit on everyone by just creating crappy and moody posts-taking their life problems out on other forum users.What sort of person does that?Are they that lonely and jobless they have all the time in the world to come on here and just insult people all day?<br /><br />I know I may get some saying &#039;&#039;man up&#039;&#039; and such,but I&#039;d like constructive answers please.I became a vendor thanks to a few fantastic people on here who showed me nothing but love and support---from total strangers!!Top people of the SR community.I became a vendor expecting of course to have the odd problem but not the frequent event of shitting in the face for no reason at all.It has kind of made part of me already want to hang up the hat and call it a day on here because I really can&#039;t be bothered with those sort of people.They just leech off the planet like a parasite:(<br />If there&#039;s any other vendors or reviewers (as reviewers will have much knowledge I&#039;m sure!) who could tell me what they do when this happens and how to advoid it and such I&#039;d be really really really appreciative.All I&#039;ve ever wanted to do since joining SR is spread the love.Not be hassled and insulted:(<br /><br />Thankyou all:D

				Just be honest and the positive will out weight the negative ,you cant let it get to you as some like it if you bite, I honestly dont care about reps but I do care about members hearing the truth and usually the truth speaks volumes.<br /><br />If you keep getting all pissed off every time some neg reps you your only adding fuel to the fire!<br /><br />Just ignore the ones asking for free samples, nothing more you can do really, make sure you send samples to people who know their product and already have a good rep here for time being till you get things sorted but try not to worry mate its not worth getting stressed about.

				Hey.I don&#039;t get stressed by the neg reps however it is pissing me off that one person is following me negging me on various posts:(Thats kind of stalking!<br />It&#039;s just the general attitude of some on here.It&#039;s supposed to be a community but some just seem to think of it as a chance to get free drugs or abuse and yes that does get me down:(

				We took a *lot* of flack like this when we first started - freebie hunters, tyre kickers etc. <br /><br />That&#039;s fine, we had stuff to give away, but it wasn&#039;t for free. We wanted feedback from established community members in exchange, but a certain minority seemed to ignore that bit and ask endlessly for giveaways.<br /><br />I remember getting quite irate at a few of them. I was struggling for money at the time and had scraped and saved to get my vendors account, supplies, security rig etc. I let rip on a few of them... <br /><br />And instantly started kicking the shit out of myself for it. &quot;What the... All the I&#039;m doing is pissing off my potential customers... Grrrr...&quot;<br /><br />It felt counter-intuitive because I want to do a good job, serve my clients well and generally be level in all my activities, but I held my own, even in the face of threats of bad reviews.<br /><br />And I found that the minority were exactly that - a minority. <br /><br />Play by the rules, follow your own code within it and treat everyone with respect unless they prove themselves unworthy of receiving it. <br /><br />You may piss a couple of people off in the short run, but you will be ultimately in a better standing in the long run.
