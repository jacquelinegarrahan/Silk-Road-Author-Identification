				I&#039;m missing the road so much! I was on last week when the attacks first started happening and when i came on today to order my shit for the weekend i thought the road would be back in all its glory. What i got was a wounded silk road that is still under attack. I wish who ever is orchestrating this attack would die a slow painful death!<br /><br />I use the road to get drugs that aren&#039;t available to me elsewhere so this attack has really messed my shit up! All i can hope for now is that the road prevails and defeats this enemy!<br /><br />I will continue to check the road all day but the chance of me getting my drugs for the weekend are now very slim! I had a look at Atlantis and there is just not enough vendors and i struggle to believe this could ever be a viable contender to the road!<br /><br />I read a few post that mention a secret URL that you can use to get to the road, is this true? I know that for a secret URL to work it would have to remain SECRET and my chances of getting it are very slim. I just wondered if there is a link out there that people are currently using to get to the road?
