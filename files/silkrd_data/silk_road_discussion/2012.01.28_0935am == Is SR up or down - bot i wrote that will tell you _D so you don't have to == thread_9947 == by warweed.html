				http://warweedoeg6lfyoz.onion/updown/<br />Bookmark me - I will be helpful in the future :)<br /><br /><br />Because tor browser bundle and such does not allow javascript i had to resort to old skool meta refresh which refreshes the page every 130 seconds my bot in the background checks to see if SR is up or down every 120 seconds and the edits the index.htm :) tis rather simple but rather then people always asking figure i would write this and settle it the fact that it auto refreshes just means leave the tab open or what have you and you will see UP or DOWN in the title :)<br /><br />cheers,<br />-warweed<br /><br />

				Lol if it says up and you can&#039;t load it that means your node is dead ;) i won&#039;t explain entirely how my system works but my system always maintains a steady tor connections and it was tested and actually used during the SR outage :) and i was back on SR within seconds :) I&#039;m going to mod the bot up a bit to increase some of the wait times when it say silkroad is up and decrease it a bit for when it says silkroad is down no need to hammer SR if it&#039;s up :P<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thanks a lot for that tool warweed!<br /><br />There is also this site I&#039;ve found which checks if any .onion site is down or not:<br />http://zw3crggtadila2sg.onion/downornot/<br /><br />To check if Silk Road is up or down would be:<br />http://zw3crggtadila2sg.onion/downornot/index.php?url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/

				yes another alternative is bridged relays <br /><br />the issue is alot of exit nodes are blocking sr and in light of forbes and gawker it would not surprise me if sr got a shit ton of traffic and both your isp was blocking your node and if your node was block access to sr
