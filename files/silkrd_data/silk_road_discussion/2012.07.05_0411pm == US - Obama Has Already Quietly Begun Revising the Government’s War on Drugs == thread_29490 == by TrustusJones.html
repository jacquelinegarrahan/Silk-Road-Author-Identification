				Interesting article from the Daily Beast today: Obama cuts half the funding for National Guard helicopters that search for Pot Fields<br /><br />Never mind a second term, Barack Obama’s pivot on the drug war has already begun.<br /><br />While Marc Ambinder’s much discussed, scantily-sourced GQ report of a second-term “pivot” runs through the murderers’ row of complaints against the Drug War—the cocaine/crack disparity; mandatory minimum sentencing; property-seizure laws and the fattening of the corrections industry—he doesn’t report that the president’s “aides and associates” have identified any of these as a starting point for Obama to “tackle” first.<br /><br />“Don’t expect miracles,” Ambinder cautions, and that’s where he gets it wrong. The miracle has already happened. Here’s the answer that Ambinder’s anonymous sources failed to leak to him: the pivot point for Obama’s new direction is homegrown marijuana, and it’s already started.<br /><br />The presidential request for the FY13 budget deals a mortal blow to the helicopter-powered marijuana eradication umbrella. It does so by cutting in half the funding for the U.S. National Guard Counterdrug program, the Defense Department’s contribution to the marijuan-eradication effort that has, for the past 20 years, limited the size of domestic marijuana patches and increased the demand for “blood pot” imported by ultraviolent Mexican drug cartels—while doing nothing to stem the supply to anyone who wants to get high.<br /><br />Until now, the DEA and state law enforcement could count on the National Guard to fly hundreds of helicopter hours over national forests and other public land, where growers became active following the passage of property-seizure laws in the Reagan years—but the FY13 budget changes that.<br /><br />The 50-percent cut is not being apportioned evenly across the states—it’s a two-thirds cut in Oregon and a 70-percent cut in Kentucky, while the Southern border states are receiving less severe reductions in funding. It’s essentially a diversion of Defense Department assets away from the interior American marijuana fields to where the national-security risk is greatest: along our Southern border.<br /><br />“We’re not going to have legalized weed anytime soon,” the president told late-night television host Jimmy Fallon in April. But there’s a lot a president can do to unwind the marijuana prohibition without going full-on Peter Tosh. After all, how effective is an umbrella with holes in it?<br /><br />Without a fully functional eradication program, the feds cannot keep domestic pot production down. So even if it remains illegal, domestic production could boom during FY13, the first growing season of Obama’s potential second term.<br /><br />The road map to pot decriminalization, an essential first step for any pivot on the drug war, can be found in the executive order President Obama issued on immigration to effectively implement components of the DREAM Act without the help of Congress by ordering his executive branch to de-prioritize enforcement of certain laws.<br /><br />The simple fact that President Obama would even consider breaking the taboo of the marijuana prohibition is itself a miracle, given that our last president from the Democratic Party gave us the 1996 federal three-strikes law, which remains one of the most outrageous components of the pot prohibition, sending nonviolent marijuana growers to prison for life without parole for the offense of persistent criminal farming.<br /><br />When Obama makes public his drug-war pivot, he will have 40 years of an abusive relationship between the Oval Office and marijuana to undo. When Ambinder says that drug laws in America “were created almost nakedly to marginalize disfavored groups,” what he’s talking about in part is how President Nixon doubled down on the already-in-place marijuana prohibition on the morning of May 26, 1971.<br /><br />“I want a goddamn strong statement on marijuana,” Nixon told his chief-of-staff, Bob Haldeman. “I mean one on marijuana that just tears the ass out of them ... By God we are going to hit the marijuana thing, and I want to hit it right square in the puss ...”<br /><br />President Reagan followed suit with a massive expansion of the federal government’s powers in matters of drug-related justice: eliminating federal parole; creating mandatory minimum sentences, and allowing federal agents to seize land and property from people merely suspected of being involved in “drugs,” whether those drugs were marijuana or heroin, in complete disregard of the suspect’s Fourth Amendment protections.<br /><br />When Obama makes public his drug-war pivot, he will have 40 years of an abusive relationship between the Oval Office and marijuana to undo.<br />Any détente of the drug war that Obama might tackle in his theoretical second term must include, eventually, a massive legislative package that returns America to a pre-Nixon posture on pot; flattens the cocaine/crack disparity; eliminates mandatory minimum sentences; re-instates federal parole for nonviolent and victimless crimes; reins in property-seizure laws; grounds the fleet of pot-spotting helicopters; and grants blanket clemency for those currently serving federal prison time for trumped-up marijuana crimes.<br /><br />In other words, in his second term, President Obama needs to kick Richard Nixon right square in the puss. In the meantime, by easing enforcement of domestic marijuana cultivation, thereby reducing demand for Mexican blood pot and freeing up Defense Department assets to send to the Southwest, the president can achieve another of his campaign promises: improving our border security.<br /><br />http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/05/obama-has-already-quietly-begun-revising-the-government-s-war-on-drugs.html<br /><br />

				When you go to the voting booth to vote for a president you are always faced with a difficult decision. You have two piles of shit and you have to pick the one pile of shit that stinks less than the other. If the legalization of marijuana is what you want, I think a democratic president, a democratically controlled congress, or better yet a combination of the two is your best bet.

				Regardless of whether you support Obama, a vote for him is a vote in the direction of a democratically controlled Congress. The Republicans are notorious for shutting down any pro-legalization initiatives, plus, voting for Mitt Romney out of spite isn&#039;t going to do you much good either.

				The Republicans are notorious for striping any personal freedoms, and they will do it in the name of SECURITY or CHRISTIANITY. So they think that we need more taxes and harder laws to govern the population but less regulation and taxes on businesses. I vote democratically but I also understand that all of our politicians are bought and paid for by the 1%.

				I don&#039;t really think he gives two shits. He&#039;s simply indifferent about it, if not slightly in favor of the war (although, with recent events, idk if he can maintain this with a straight face). It&#039;s not something he&#039;s really taken a super definitive stance on, and not something there has been any REAL talk of, other than speculation like this article. You can read into his actions all you want, but there are other issues in the country other than the war. I think it&#039;s on his mind, and certainly not the last thing on his mind, but definitely not of urgent importance to him.

				Yeah, people think if all this was legalized then it&#039;d be the best thing since sliced bread but I see an extremely dark scenario tbh. <br /><br />I mean if people think if all our favourite tipples were fully legalized that it&#039;d be the cure for all the crap that we have to go through when actually, it&#039;d be potentially a fuck of a lot worse. If you really think the Gov would let the current networks and drug trade as a whole then you are every possible shade of naive there is. They would just license people like Pfizer and their equals to produce drugs and they wouldn&#039;t be handing any other licenses out to anyone that was absolutely necessary. All this would equate to the fact we (and by we I mean those that trade and profit from the current system) would lose all control and be completely cut out of the business altogether. There is no way that Pfizer/the U.S Gov/Any other Gov would be willing to allow the cartels in places like South America, Afghanistan, the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent, the MDMA manufacturers in places like Amsterdam and Eastern Europe and the Cannabis farmers in places like Africa and Mexico to carry on being in charge of the means of production because they are CRIMINALS. Governments only sit down at the talking-table and give anything to organizations that use violence and commit crime for POLITICAL ends, they couldn&#039;t give a solitary fuck if ya just doing it to make a lot of cheddar. Also no government is going to listen to &quot;The Union of Drug Traffickers/Dealers&quot; because guess what, they wont have to give a solitary fuck if you are having your livelihood taken away because again WE ARE CRIMINALS. People fail to realize that &quot;Regulation&quot; means just that, the government is gunna regulate it, not YOU AND ME. Once you allow that then it is taken out of your hands FOREVER. The only exception to this may be puff where they may use the Amsterdam model, but that&#039;s it and personally I don&#039;t give a shit about puff anyway coz I don&#039;t sell it. <br /><br />This is why I came to the conclusion that I prefer the system we have now because at least we can control it and we get a slice of the sweet pie. Take that away and my pie get&#039;s robbed and I&#039;m not down for my pie gettin nicked. The most ideal thing we are ever gunna get IMO is SR or maybe (and I can&#039;t see this happenin) if something with a better model than SR comes along and supplants it but that is highly unlikely. I can actually say that with a fair amount of certainty as well because for a mental exorcize I tried to troubleshoot SR from how it works on face-value and then tried to come up with a superior business model and I couldn&#039;t do one or come up with any major changes I&#039;d make to it (not talking about features on the site here, talkin about the general principles of SR). I did the same thing for Mt Gox and found 5+ principles of operation that could be improved on. So yeah, props to DPR + co, you have given us as good as we can get.

				Also, an afterthought. <br /><br />There is absolutely no point in blaming capitalism for the plights of the drug trade and how it works. The drug trade is by it&#039;s very nature, capitalist. This is an fundamental and undeniable truth and whoever controls the drug trade, be it &quot;criminals&quot; or if it was flipped Pfizer and corps like that. Neither drug dealers or Pfizer are to blame so don&#039;t think that being under a communism or socialism would put that right, it would be worse under them. What makes the shit that goes with the drug trade exist is the way that it as an enterprise as a whole is dealt with by governments. They try and shoot the drug dealers or lock us up for a very long time OR if it was flipped, they would allow it to be monopolized by corporations so they would be able to regulate it (and remember regulation means control). Under a socialist/communist government they would own the means of production and have even more control than a democratic government would. <br /><br />The only situation that would provide a perfect world is if they legalized it and just imposed a tax, however with anything other than Alcohol/Ciggies and Puff they wouldn&#039;t do that because the chemistry of everything else is too complex/effects too strong for them to deem it safe. <br /><br />Annnnd that is me all done.

I blame capitalism for pushing mass consumption and materialism on us, as well as how my country creates it&#039;s currency, We&#039;re just printing off money, creating value out of thin air, causing our debt to go deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper....well, you get the idea..<br /><br /><br />And about drugs becoming legal, i wouldn&#039;t mind if corporations controlled hard drugs. There would still be a fuck load of jobs, as there is a huge market for hard drugs (obviously)<br />Look at Alcohol. It was once illegal, controlled by &#039;criminals&#039; some good guys, some bad guys, all just trying to make a buck and get people drunk. <br /><br />When the government lifted prohibition, alcohol became controlled by corporations, but its not like the government controls how much they make or sell. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see anything wrong with all drugs being legal and treated like most commodities

				It&#039;s big money for politicians and agencies. It&#039;s actually bankrupting the government to keep up with this ongoing and ineffective war on drugs.&nbsp; Just imagine how muck money would be saved by not prosecuting a lot of poor people because of a joint, or how many people are locked up in jail for non violent drug related crimes. We have the highest incarceration to population percentage in the world. There is big money involved but it&#039;s not the government that gets it.

How have they convinced you that your vote is the only way you can have a voice?&nbsp; If you really want to have a voice, spend your time doing something great, be a Tim DeChristopher, or Jim Bell, or DPR!<br /><br />Voting is much more akin to liking something on Facebook than it is to enacting positive change in the world.<br /><br />But of course if you don&#039;t vote you won&#039;t get that awesome &quot;I voted&quot; sticker, so maybe you guys are right ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				To the above poster on non profits.....<br /><br />Sorry bud, but while they may help animahls! all over the world they are part of an industry that REQUIRES A PROBLEM TO EXIST for the organization to work. People get jobs get budgets have overhead and paychecks before a single animal is saved. <br /><br />Non profit sounds great but is just more commerce that does a little good. The amount of trees killed for pamphlets and the resources depleted in whatever &quot;help game&quot; they&#039;ve devised is just more capitalism with some sugar on top.<br /><br />And its so GREAT to see my fellow non voters here!!<br /><br />Thinking you have a voice is worse than not having one.<br /><br />Oh u guys n gals know how they always have a blank write in space on the ballots??<br /><br />What about this one:<br /><br />DPR FOR PRESIDENT!

				I believe the reason we disagree so easily is that our logic is often too clouded by emotion. It&#039;s a challenge of identity. We personalize with the information we know and rarely can truly become objective and seek truth rather than just being right. But I could be wrong :)

Obama says we&#039;ll be out by 2014, but watch, that will change some time after the election).&nbsp; Bush murders 6000 civilians with his shock and awe campaign, while Obama enjoys going on civilian killing sprees via drone bomb and also gets many lulz by having the CIA ride by on motorcycles and attach sticky bombs to the cars of Iranian scientists.&nbsp; Bush puts us 6-7 trillion in debt, Obama throws on another 6-7 trillion, fuck it why not?<br /><br />Brave New World also made the point that this election is looking worse than ever.&nbsp; You have the guy who is unprecedentedly funded by wall street vs. the guy who is sitting on half a billion of his own. And now of course money can flow unfettered and anonymously between corporations and politicians.&nbsp; Both sides are becoming total media whores too.&nbsp; Did you see the republican presidential debates (all like 20 of them)?&nbsp; They milked that for as much cash as possible!&nbsp; Have you noticed Obama writing books, helping make a movie about him assassinating Bin Laden, and trying to create a fucking viral video on Jimmy Fallon?<br /><br />Look at our closest allies, Britain is a high tech police state, Russia murders journalists, Mexico is owned by the cartels.&nbsp; The largest oil company in Mexico is Pemex (according to wikipedia it&#039;s the &quot;world&#039;s second largest non-publicly listed company by total market value&quot;), it&#039;s state owned and was found to have laundered like a billion a year for the Zetas (the most violent cartel, that mass murders native migrants in the tens of thousands if they refuse to be drug mules).&nbsp; But of course the US has never had a problem being allied with coke dealers, Ronald Reagan and the CIA helped Manuel Noriega of Panama bring coke into LA in the 80s because they were scared of Fidel Castro.<br /><br />Ok starting to ramble but the US is really fucked, and you should get it out of your head that you have to work within their system.&nbsp; Brave New world made some other points too and I could make many more, but seriously we wouldn&#039;t be having this discussion if most of you were more informed.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Also Brave New World is right about money and the drug war too.&nbsp; Think about all the cops, DEA, FBI, prison workers, people in the legal system, people in government, etc. that would not have jobs if prohibition were lifted.&nbsp; Of course the same is true of real wars and money.&nbsp; Did you know that the US recently conducted the largest arms deal since the end of the Cold War?&nbsp; We sold a bunch of fighter jets to Saudi Arabia for 29 billion dollars.&nbsp; Wake up people...<br /><br />

You will get that hope and change Obama promises you. You dumb fuck. You think your vote matters? You are hilarious. Get the fuck off this site. It is for anarchists.<br /><br />Cool name by the way. Fucking loser.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What&#039;s with all the hate? <br /><br />This site isn&#039;t for anarchists. It was founded by an anarchist.. But this site is for people that buy drugs online. You don&#039;t have to subscribe to agorist-anarchist principles to be here, and you know that. <br /><br />You talk of wanting to change the world and having the masses wake up but as soon as someone disagrees with you you resort to venomous attacks and gutter snipe jibes. You don&#039;t seem very &quot;awake&quot; to me.<br /><br />You want people to come round to your line of thought? Then explain your points, cogently, and intelligently.. And let their reason decide. If you&#039;re right, people will come round. <br /><br />What you&#039;re doing however is just attacking anyone with opposing views to you. If there isn&#039;t space here for people that stand against everything you believe in, then what kind of anarchist are you? And what kind of anarchism are you proposing? It seems to me that you just want people to say you&#039;re right.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Killerbunnies thinks he is right when he is so blatantly wrong. Many others on this site agree with him.<br />Unfortunately that was very disappointing.<br />I understand the masses of people believing that their vote matters IRL but I had the mistaken impression it would be different here.<br />NOPE. More of the same blind sheep. <br />It hurt. It was a shot to the chest. As a result, I became angry. I try to be positive but it is hard when everyone is so brainwashed.<br />I have found that this forum holds the same political views of the majority posts I see on YouTube or opinions I hear on TV.<br /><br />Go ahead and vote. <br />Go ahead and continue to consent to the destruction of Mother Earth, to the murdering of children and the extinction of bio-diversity by casting your vote this November.<br />I on the other hand refuse to aid and abet these criminals. <br />Refuse to give the illusion of legitimacy. <br />Refuse to give constructive consent. <br />Refuse to give the impression I agree with their decisions.<br />By casting a vote, that is exactly what one does.<br />That is sickening to say the least.<br /><br />The reason I use &quot;fuck&quot; is because time is running out and I am trying to drive a point home.<br />Either change our ways or die. It is that simple.<br />If one cannot see that the current system is unsustainable for the human species as a whole at this point, I don&#039;t know what else to do other than tell them to go fuck themselves.<br />It starts to wear on a man. But don&#039;t worry. I will be off the grid soon and will watch from the sidelines.<br /><br />From this point forward I will try my best to stick to the Drug Review Section.<br />My opinion is meaningless and I cannot change anything but myself.<br />I have no time to educate, persuade or influence those who are in denial and are living in the Matrix.<br /><br />Thank you Springseed and Helll.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I for one enjoy your posts. I&#039;ve never been big into politics, or world affairs, but your views do resonate with me and give me a new perspective to ponder. I&#039;d suggest continuing to spread your ideas, as I&#039;m sure their are plenty of others like me who mostly just read and don&#039;t post as often.

				Hi--I&#039;m a newbie here of the social, non-violent anarchist type. Well, unless you violate the space I&#039;m inhabiting at the present moment.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; I just wanted to introduce myself and let people know my name, as I may be along the same road you are, and we may pass one another on our travels.&nbsp; I hope to be the best, most trusted consumer and possible seller on the site, if I find some wares along the way that others might enjoy, too, I&#039;ll put it up for offer!&nbsp; Stranger things have happened.&nbsp; May the wind always be at your back on your safe travels down this road!&nbsp; &nbsp;:D&nbsp; &nbsp;Bubbles67&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Oh, and as for the Obama topic--*sigh*--I truly HOPE our votes actually COUNT (don&#039;t believe they do in most states) and like most of you, I&#039;m part of the 99%, so there&#039;s no other option that is feasible to me is Rocky, but I&#039;ll let you know when and if we get a chance to vote this year.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)&nbsp; Everyone have a great day--I hope I meet you on our travels!

				IMO Obama campaign was the last possible potential hope (i mean the last time many of americans believed) that &quot;IF WE JUST GET OUR GUY IN THEIR, THINGS WILL REALLY CHANGE! (or so it sorta maybe seemed like it..... I didn&#039;t have much in high hopes but if you were around during the black pres to be frenzy... there did seem to be.... sigh... some tiny smidgeon of hope). <br /><br />Now it&#039;s just a bunch of shit... it probably always was... just didn&#039;t notice or wasn&#039;t mature/educated/awake enough to realize it. <br /><br />Does everyone here know that we&#039;re using this earth up at a rate as if we had five of them? When the resources, i.e. oil run out... then I believe the real warring will begin. The peak of oil sources on the globe has long since been over.

				@BNW, I&#039;ve enjoyed reading your posts. You should keep posting, even if it does get upsetting. This thread has been a really interesting. I have all sorts of topics to read up on. I have to say I&#039;m fairly non political. They&#039;re all lying, cheating bastards. <br /><br />@thereisnospoon, I agree. This planet isn&#039;t renewable. Once it&#039;s gone, it&#039;s gone. When resources that we take for granted start running out, real war and the collapse of any pretense of civilization is going to start.<br /><br />Does anyone remember that really old Twilight Zone episode where the robbers stole all that gold and then froze themselves? Came back 100 years later and their gold was worthless? Kind of where we could be heading.
