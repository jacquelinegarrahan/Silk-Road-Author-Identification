				One night i was thinking the same thing. They have so much stuff readily available. And at amazing quality. I guess you just have to know the right people if you want things you can&#039;t get at coffee shops. I&#039;m going to take a trip to amsterdam maybe next year for the first time. I hope to have fun. :)

				well they have that famous tolerant approach to soft drugs with coffeeshops and smartshops sure but hard drugs is a whole other ballgame. plus only being allowed to buy 5g a time at legit coffeeshops is kinda shit for heavy smoking locals. if you know the right people getting good quality for a good price is easy as but some people prefer to procure their drugs online for the safety, convenience, variety and anonymity as well as some semblance of quality control. many older people won&#039;t have the contacts or want to approach sketchy dealers. then once you get outside of the bigger cities some places only have 1 or 2 coffeeshops with shit quality/variety and the dutch are becoming far less tolerant than they used to be, just look at how many people vote for geert wilders. by 2014 the govt is forcing over 40 coffeeshops in amsterdam to close. cannabis isn&#039;t even decriminalised there. then you have the foreign students in places like maastricht who aren&#039;t allowed to buy in coffeeshops anymore because of the weitpass bullshit. most of them use friends or local dealers but i&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good few dutch resident buyers on here, albeit many many less buying cannabis products compared to users in other countries.
