				Honestly I&#039;ve gotten used to them now, they&#039;re a tolerable nuisance. I&#039;m more concerned about pricks like Eris, and you dealt with that post haste, +1 for that. Perhaps is we get enough people in on it we can return the spam favor to them and hit em with a DDoS. They&#039;re scamming people anyway, what are they gonna do, call the cops?

				What about spam posts inside other people&#039;s threads? I usually only report those to the mods, because they tend to get missed. Saw one the other day that was from December 1.
