				As the title suggests, is there any way for those SR vendors and customers who have not provided a backup wallet address while the site was up to apply for release of said coins? <br />Or perhaps it is appropriate time for silkroadiplkjo7t.onion, bpbpoqbqdodbqbqb.onion, or pddqoboqqqqqbqdq.onion to be turned on?<br /><br />hindsight is a painful thing sometimes!<br /><br />

				I answered your question and I was just giving you advice man, it shouldn&#039;t have to be a mod telling you to follow basic forum etiquette and not clog sub forums with off topic questions.

				I think its more of a discussion, like myself I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve provided a backup address. Not sure, but why not just refund it to the addresses that sent the BTC?

				Yeah I guess you&#039;re right. If SR is down for a very long time DPR could set up a new hidden service specifically to login with your account and withdrawal your coins to an address but I think it&#039;s far more likely that DPR&#039;s priorities are getting SR back online and that everyone will be waiting until then...

				Its not a great idea.<br /><br />The whole point of the backup address was that if the site went down and DPR couldn&#039;t get it up and running again then coins would be sent to the backup address.<br /><br />If the site is down then there is no way to edit the backup address.. is there?&nbsp; If you put up a new site to just handle backup addresses then the hackers will just flood that one too.<br /><br />Its just not something that could be done.&nbsp; <br /><br />
