				To other vendors out there, I am new to selling on SR, so I am not familiar with what kind of messages are common and which are out of place / suspicious /etc. Here is the message I received (on SR):<br /><br />&quot;i am very new to this site. Just joined today. I would like to order 60 -30 mg. ADDERALL IR TABLETS. Please tell me what to do from here. How do I buy those bitcoins? This is all so new to me and I need your help to help me navigate around this website so that I can get my order to you quickly. &quot;<br /><br />I am not going to say this persons username just because it would be unprofessional. I pointed them in the direction of the buyers guide, this forum, and my profile, which clearly says to encrypt all communication. But I just want to know is it normal for people who want to make their first purchases with you to not already have some idea of how to obtain bitcoins etc? Should I be suspicious? <br /><br />Secondly, would I be protected if they place that large order (60 pills) with me and then claim they either did not receive / the package was empty or missing pills? or would this be very risky for me and would I be likely to loose the pills and the money in escrow if they make those false claims?<br /><br />Another odd thing about this user is that when I click on their username , instead of taking me to their buyer stats page or whatever, it just takes me to a page with a message box to send them a message. I have tried selecting their username from different spots, just in case it was something simple, but no matter what it does not show me any buyer stats. I am not sure if this is normal or what, but when I select my own screenname it goes to my profile, so I would think for buyers it would show their purchasing stats.

				Hey Creamsicle! Welcome to SR<br /><br /><br />First - you only get to see buyer stats after an order has been placed. Until then nothing.<br /><br /><br />Messages like what you received are somewhat common. As much as it would be nice customer service to help out, there really are dozens upon dozens of tutorials out there, so when I get these I typically don&#039;t response other than to suggest they take a look at the forum for getting the help they need. <br /><br /><br />Eventually you find that you are getting so many legit orders that responding to all these kinds of inquiries would take a staff of minions just to keep up. That&#039;s a sign that you&#039;ve made it!<br /><br /><br />Last thing - read up on shipping methods to ensure you are protected. Use DCNs or Express, both of which provide you with assurance that the package has been delivered. Unfortunately this site is getting full of scammers who will claim they didn&#039;t receive your shipment (when they did) and then ask for a refund or reshipment.<br /><br /><br />Angelina
