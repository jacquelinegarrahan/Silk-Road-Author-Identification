				&nbsp;8)<br /><br />Drug Dealing @ Shows/Festivals&nbsp; &nbsp;vs.&nbsp; &nbsp; Vending on Silk Road -- which of these applies to you? Do any of you do both? If so, which is more lucrative? <br /><br />As a vendor transitioning from dealing IRL to dealing online; I&#039;d like to hear some feedback! +1 to those who are true American heroes who can successfully pull off both of these ventures simultaneously. That takes skill, money, and brains.

				Here in Australia we see some of the jail sentences the US counterparts get for dealing narcotics. They are incredibly harsh and I understand there will always be someone to take the place of someone getting busted but your police are very physical and the punishments even for just possession is completely different to here in Australia. Drug laws all over the world are quite harsh and the US is just amazing though , I don&#039;t have a sentence I can refer to regarding drug dealing convictions but I have seen a lot and they are very very long.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t it cross your mind at all? Caught once pretty much life over?

				If you are good, and have a good start investment.<br /><br />You can do very good in a festival. Come as early as possible and try to sell it all fast, even in bulk with some people looking to make money.<br /><br />Just calculated what amount of money you need to harvest, to leave to place clean, with some good profit.<br /><br /><br />But it&#039;ll be one time.<br /><br />Selling online can be done during the whole year. Every day.<br />And if you are legit, you&#039;ll make way more money selling on internet, but you&#039;ll have to face a constant competition.<br /><br /><br />In festival, when you have good product, it&#039;ll be gone fast :) the whole batch.<br /><br /><br />I always see people with kilo of weed, 100g of coke, tones of LSD Sheet, bag of pills .... it&#039;s crazy how festival can look like a drug open market town, like christiania was (is ?) ....

				Ive been selling weed and shrooms for 9 years. 14 months ago I found sr and started selling all kinds of shit. I was here when btcs were 5 bucks a piece. I paid 140 bucks to be a vendor and I sold shrooms for 3 months (jaxx). In my 9 years of selling before sr I never had a cop even look at me. The 3 months I sold on sr changed my life. 2 ford f 250s ran up on me while I was playing disc golf. Drove right through the park and right to me to put me in handcuffs for conspiracy to traffic narcotics. I got off with misdemeanor posession of marijuana. And that never happened before I started sending shit out so be careful if you live in a small town.

Normally you can plead down pretty far, but after that you&#039;re on the radar and looking at harsher sentences.

				As with anything, if you put enough time and effort into it the world can be yours.. <br /><br />&nbsp;Just IRL at the moment.. Have for many years.. Never had even the tiniest issue.. <br />Festivals are great ,you just have to think out side of the box on that.. Plan ahead, pack well and take everything into account ahead of time.. <br /><br />&nbsp;I will be joining the SR vender community in time. Mostly just shrooms once I get up and growing again.. (had a contam take out my whole stock during my last move, spore prints, syringes everything!.. Dumb friends and their beer, sigh) Everything else that I get my hands on I tend to flip pretty fast locally and have to think WAY in advance if there is an event or festival coming up to ensure I have stock on hand to cover it and my local peeps. <br /><br />I think the key, IRL or on the Road is to never get cocky, always keep an eye on the details ...IRL always know the person you are dealing to...At Festivals be aware of your surroundings, don&#039;t sell to some guy you just met who was asking around..Hang out for a while maybe even a day if its a long festival feel &quot;them&quot; out.. Most undercovers here in the states get board FAST .. If you just want to talk and hang out with them even for 15 to 20 mins most times they get edgy and will wonder off..&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;We almost never see drug dogs at events here, at least EDM events.. Some Rock events you will get some at the gates but that&#039;s not hard to by pass.. (find some dumbass that has been smoking weed in the parking lot and walk in next to him. The dogs go nuts for the guy thats been smoking and you just keep walking)&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I have a lot of tricks and most I would never post on a forum, some are common sense others are trade secretes ;)&nbsp; Over all you have to be smart no matter where you are dealing. The sloppy people, the ones who are just looking to make a fast buck and the ones who lack the IQ points are the ones that always get caught..OR someone that fits all of those&nbsp; points , whom&nbsp; works for / deals with/ hangs out with someone that has their game down...Those are the ones to watch out for as they will take you down with them.
