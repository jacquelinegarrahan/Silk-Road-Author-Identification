				Obviously the 4/20 sale was used as an opportunity for some well-known vendors to run big scams.&nbsp; Perhaps SR should avoid sales in the future so as not to encourage this type of scamming. I think at the end of the day, more people got hurt in the sale than saved money.&nbsp; Your thoughts?

				SR doesn&#039;t have sales, vendors do. So, unless you intend to restrict the choices of buyers and sellers, this is a moot point. Please wake up guys and stop begging SR to restrict us and just make better choices, don&#039;t do away with choice.

				I think you need to wake up, dude.&nbsp; SR does have sales.&nbsp; Silk Road initiated, promoted and implemented the 4/20 sale.&nbsp; I think you are just not paying attention.&nbsp; I&#039;m not referring to specific vendor sales, and I&#039;m not suggesting SR restrict us.&nbsp; Perhaps you should re-read my post s l o w l y, because clearly you don&#039;t understand.

				Yes it should have sales. It should just have people smart enough to not FE. Why blame blaming SR for a FUD that you decided to make. Like I said to someone else in another thread SR ain&#039;t your dad, it don&#039;t took you in at night and it definitely don&#039;t kiss you on the head.

				I agree with limitless mostly, no problem with the sales just don&#039;t FE.&nbsp; I got everything I wanted during the sale without problems, in escrow.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anything the sale really did open my eyes at how much SR is making off of commission if they can afford to give away 10-100 BTC every 420 seconds for 72 hours...

I genuinely don&#039;t think it&#039;s the sale that was to blame though. It&#039;s people hyping themselves up over it and not keeping their head on their shoulders.

				I see SR&#039;s promotion of sales as them advertising the events because after all they get a commission. Beyond that, I don&#039;t see SR as having anything to do with the sales. The vendors are still the ones who decide to do it and either do or dont. What you are asking is essentially is if SR should do like they they did with cigarette commercials years ago. They banned the commercials but not the cigarettes since they figured the commercials lured people into buying the deadly little bastards. No matter how slow I read it, thats what I get from it.<br /><br />There is no need to get all hyper active. You&#039;re welcome to get that way if you want, but I&#039;m not gonna join you, waaaay to stoned.

				<br /><br />Well, I sure don&#039;t like them. I didn&#039;t have any special prices during the sale but I still was affected.<br /><br />The whole week coming up to the date sales are lower because everyone is waiting.

I had so many orders it was the most irresponsible thing I&#039;ve done in my SR career because I put my safety on the line for the 4/20 sale since I had to drop off several packages over a small period of time to a limited amount of post offices. This is why now I am taking a long break so the heat can die down but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll participate in the next sale, too much of a headache.

				I&#039;m not a big fan of the sales I&#039;ve seen so far, because the amount I save isn&#039;t worth the decrease in &quot;customer service&quot; and the delay in shipping times that sales inevitably cause.<br /><br />But then again, my orders are never for more than a couple hundred bucks at a time.&nbsp; If I was a bigger spender, it would obviously make more of a difference to me.&nbsp; I budget a certain amount to spend, and I&#039;m going to spend it regardless.&nbsp; While a sale might save me a little coin, it&#039;s not enough to actually increase the amount of product I get without me spending more than what I wanted to anyway.<br /><br />That&#039;s just me, though.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure for a lot of people, sales are more exciting.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s not as if mail delivery statistics didn&#039;t go wild on 4/20.<br />It would be wise to schedule another big sale like that on 3/20, to prevent an extremely predictable and dangerous pattern to occur.

				It seems to me the sales are just making an easier target for mail detection and interception.<br /><br />Scammers? Sure and the sales give those like Tony a perfect setup but that is a product of putting vendors on a pedestal and whipping up on any discouraging words, no matter true or not.<br />Just like IRL....the guy with the bag owns you. If you can&#039;t speculate or discuss ANYTHING for fear of being cut off, ESPECIALLY if the vendor talks that talk, then he OWNS you. I came here to never deal with that again.<br />So the scammer part of sales isn&#039;t an issue because it fits in another category, personal responsibility. And using the tools we have to accurately keep each other informed.<br /><br /><br />But unless all vendor/buyer units voluntarily randomize/delay shipping a sale concentrates the probabilities of discovery, by either LE or mail thieves.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to vote cause it ain&#039;t no fuckin democracy, it&#039;s something that works instead, the free market. I&#039;ll vote with my bitcoins.

				If people are stupid enough to finalize early then they get what they get.<br /><br />There is a reason that we have escrow and I don&#039;t think it is for saving a down payment on a house.If vendors ask for FE then that is their choice but remember BUYER BEWARE!.<br /><br />Alot of people are pissed off because a couple vendors made off with alot of money &amp; I sure would be upset if it were my cash but I learned the same way others did I FE once and got burned now never again will it happen to me.<br /><br />I have only asked 1 buyer to FE early because he wanted my product and he had an outragous refund number 29.4% I told him I would ship but he would need to FE early to try and help him repair his stats which he did &amp; he received his parcel a couple days later.<br /><br />&nbsp;no big issue but sometimes buyers need help &amp; to be scammed is one reason Buyers will claim they never shipped or never arrived when they start a resolution I think many just try to make their money back from other vendors because they were scammed by someone else<br /><br />FE should be the choice of the buyer But he should be the one responsible and stop whining when he gets ripped off he already knows the rules here and to carry on these long annoying threads about this scam &amp; that scam everyone knows after the first ten posts&nbsp;

				I think the sale was a wonderful idea. It encouraged me to spend a good bit at a time when I would have normally spent $0, as I wasn&#039;t actively looking for stuff, but instead saw great deals, sale items, and promos. It was certainly exciting!<br /><br />I got excellent deals, and also won 10 BTC!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I look forward greatly to future events/sales. <br /><br />I also never had to finalize early for any sale items.

				Yes... IMO it&#039;s better if SR continue to have sales occasionally.. I saved goooood money in the two past sales, and reinvested them for other purchases... I was lucky to be not cheated by a scammer ( fucking scammers, i hate it&nbsp; &gt;:() but not too lucky to win something. <br /><br />However i&#039;ve not FE and i&#039;ve made my business with good and honest vendors.. Well, Tony also seemed a good vendor before &quot;the great 4/20 swindle&quot;.. <br />From now i will sticky to my best vendors, and give a chance to others only after reading good reviews here on the forum <br /><br />We&#039;ve got only this two weapons in our hands (research on forum and not FE)..

				Correct me if I wrong but didnt DPR waive his 10% commission for the 420 sale? All the orders I placed on 4/20 came through with flying colors, and were received on monday afternoon (4/23)!<br /><br />I did not finalize early for any of the purchases I made either btw. For me the 420 sale was awesome. <br /><br />What happened with tony and the other scammers really put a hurt on the community, but could have all been prevented if buyers didnt finalize early. <br /><br />I say let the sales continue, and thank you DPR!<br /><br /><br /><br />

Like I said to someone else in another thread SR ain&#039;t your dad, it don&#039;t took you in at night and it definitely don&#039;t kiss you on the head. It&#039;s a place where you buy/sell drugs and other bits and pieces.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This x 100.<br /><br />4/20 was fucking sick. I won like £400 and so did a lot of people, plus the deals were on point.<br /><br />There&#039;s no point stopping all that just because a lot of us got scammed. That&#039;s on us. Just don&#039;t fucking FE.<br /><br />I mean, I don&#039;t understand asking SR to ban FE... Just don&#039;t FE..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly. If a person is responsible enough to find this place and see it&#039;s value then they are going to have to be responsible enough to take control of your buying security. <br /><br />On another note I am tired of reading threads like this so I am having a 5 days sale where nobody with over 5+ transaction has to FE. DOIN IT LIKE A BOSS!

				Heck yea they should continue to have sales and they should also continue to allow vendors to have their own sales. This is a sellers market and a great one at that.
