				Since 90% of SR users are thick im wiping the shit off the last version of this thread to carefully explain why the below information is posted. This particular vendor has been blatantly FE scamming all of his customers for over 10 days now and SR staff have refused to terminate his account. It is the financial incentive of SR to allow buyers to be scammed as they make their commission either way. Their attitude is &#039;we warned you, if you FE is not our problem&#039; but then openly allow scammers to continue in the face of overwhelming evidence. <br /><br />If this point is lost to you then hike up your cheerleading uniform, SR needs you. <br /><br />===<br />MushroomMagician [http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f0c0b76a7d] has been exit scamming all of his buyers by requesting FE for his 50% off listings and cancelling anyones orders who doesnt.

				Silk Road is a multimillion dollar business that&#039;s heavily reliant on repeat customers and positive feedback as to engage their customer base, and allowing people to be vendor scammed either through selective scamming or through FE scamming would be absurd. Silk Road is in this for the long run, not just out to make a quick dollar or two scamming naive buyers.

				OP may be a faggot but I agree with him here. SR does allow FE scamming to take place. I screamed and bitched and moaned about GoldMax requiring FE of all customers from day 1 and after 40 days of hundreds of orders and $20,000 of sales (I know based on his vendor ranking) with not one single package arriving he finally left. SR never did anything until they had no choice.<br /><br />SR&#039;s defense of &quot;well they can FE if they want it&#039;s their risk&quot; is no defense whatsoever when SR&#039;s own seller guide forbides even requesting FE for first 30 days of vendors account and the sellers contract says if a new vendor even asks for FE they are to immediately be banned. Yet SR constantly is bombarded by brand new vendors doing the FE scam and despite them being fully aware of this SR does NOTHING. After many many instances of this I have only been able to conclude that SR likes the massive amounts of commissions these scams provide them with more then protecting the SR buyer and protecting the reputation of vendors as a whole.<br /><br />FE does have a place though. If you order a $4,000 item from me with no feedback the only damn way you are getting that item is if you FE. For some buyers it is actually good for them because they are then able to get what they want, but requiring it of every single buyer (especially with brand new vendor) is unacceptable.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I see DRMda&#039;s point.&nbsp; From a vendor&#039;s standpoint, it is really their only defense from the buyer/scammer who far outweighs the seller/scammer.&nbsp; Drug addicts like getting their drugs for free, if they can, and will resort to anything to get those drugs.&nbsp; However, the only vendors that I ever FE for are long established sellers with the top rep&#039;s to protect.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t mind FE&#039;ing for a vendor I trust and haven&#039;t lost a product yet when doing this.&nbsp; But I&#039;d still advise anyone on here to avoid doing it at all costs.

I respond to each and every one with the same message, please do not FE.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to get scammed choose your vendors carefully and stay in escrow, how hard is to do some reading (hard for some I know) and use the protections built into the site.<br /><br />What amazes me more than anything is how people continue to FE when all the feedback on the vendor page is fucking FE FE FE FE FE! I&#039;m sorry but if you miss that massive neon flashing red warning sign combined now with pages of discussion threads screaming scam then IMHO you really need to consider if you should be using SR at all because you are simply not getting it.<br />

				I have yet to make my first order, I&#039;m doing as much research here as I can first. I&#039;m starting off with small/sample orders and will refuse to FE. If my order gets cancelled, I know now (thanks to some great posts here) that it&#039;s better to move on to a vendor who doesn&#039;t require FE than to risk it.

				From the OP&#039;s last few topics it seems hes on the hunt for cheap psychedelics, yes FE scams are bad, but if you seriously fell for it then the jokes on you. Someone offering %50 off there products and requires FE? Yeah strong red flags are raised right there.<br /><br />You seem like the most horrible person to trip with, the cheapest of all dudes with anger issues. I would not enjoy that experience as a psychonaut myself.&nbsp; Good luck on your future ventures on the road though, and keep your eyes open...... it&#039;s wild out there.

				i posted a thread about this about two weeks ago also...was trying to warn ppl before it got out of hand i spotted it was a scam right off the jump. as bad as it seems for DPR to not care (which i highly doubt is the case) at the end of the day u r warned sooo many times not to finalize before u get ur product that if u get scammed because u FE&#039;d then i kinda feel the same way. Its kind of ur problem. as ppl stated above this place runs off of customer feedback and word of mouth, do your research before you buy and ask the community for help i mean that is the point of this place! as long as ur smart u wont run into bad vendors just keep ur eye peeled for too good to be true and always look for feedback. o o and again DONT FE lol. <br /><br /><br /><br />i do think its pretty blatant that hes been scamming for weeks now it is kinda sketchy hes been operating so long. maybe a word from DPR would clear things up?<br /><br /><br />

				Yes i agree you should never Fe, i have done it once &amp; my ass was going all the time until it landed but in my defense it was a top vender with Fe only, i started my account then just bought things domestic or single nbome&#039;s &amp; never had to Fe now got over 50 transactions so just do your homework on venders before jumping in, in this SR it pays to take your time, do homework/study venders/forums ETC &amp; not rush &amp; jump in or most likely could get burned Etc<br />If you are in a rush then irl is for you as SR is not a quick fix, coins/ bank/transit time its a place i can wait &amp; look forward to quality goods usually a week longest is what i wait but have had longer &amp; most have been quicker.<br />hope this helps some new members to the community &amp; not be scared<br />Good luck &amp; enjoy shopping.<br />WA<br />&nbsp;

				MM was doing a classic exit scam and it was clear as day to see, you cant really blame SR because they clearly tell you not to FE so that is your problem for doing so, dont get me wrong i FE and got burned so i know how it feels but you just cant FE period. that being said yes SR makes commission but there are also scammer buyers too so SR has to view the total picture....report the vendor and encourage others to do so as well and they will handle it, but never FE even for a vendor you used a thousand times you need to let the order arrive , inspect all aspects, than release funds, you cant FE for any reason cause you never know if the mail fucks it up too so its best to never ever do that, hope you find better vendors man there are legit good ones, just not many
