If after a month it still hasn&#039;t arrived, submit another proposal to the vendor in question, prior to the most recent proposal lapses of course, for either a full or partial refund. If you can&#039;t agree on a resolution, an Admin will decide for you&nbsp; based on the evidence provided and your stats. <br />There is absolutely NO reason whatsoever for anyone to let an order auto-finalize.

				Extending the time allowed before auto-finalize a few days, is not implying that the vendor is lying. You could have easily asked for a 3 day extension and continued to wait for your product.&nbsp; The resolution center is there to help you and the vendor.

				The resolution center could have saved you a lot of grief here. You taking the order to resolution does NOT automatically mean you are implying the vendor is doing something wrong. When you take an order to the resolution center, there is an option to extend the auto-finalization date or request a refund. I have had an order extended in resolution for over a month so it wouldn&#039;t auto-finalize (ended up getting ripped off, he never sent anything, but that&#039;s neither here nor there.) <br /><br />You can request to extend the AF date for up to 10 days. When and if that 10 days is almost up and you still haven&#039;t received anything, you can ask to extend it again. And again. All that means is you are still waiting for your order. I am sorry you weren&#039;t aware of this beforehand. When I had to do this, it was my very first order - I messaged the vendor that I still hadn&#039;t received anything and that the last thing I wanted was an auto-finalize on my stats, he directed me to the resolution center for an extension. It is a shame you were unaware of this. I would message SR Support and tell them that. They may scrub the auto-finalize from your stats, but they may just say you should&#039;ve done your research. It&#039;s still worth a shot. Good luck.

				There is nothing &quot;bad faith&quot; about opening a resolution. It is a place to extend escrow and work our a common agreement between buyer and seller. If you can work something out then that is what will happen, if you disagree then the staff will make a descision.<br /><br />I NEVER resent a buyer going to resolution, it is part of the escrow system we both agreed to.

If you take no action within the 17 days the order will as you now know auto finalize. After 9 days however the resolution center becomes available to you, something you clearly were not aware of, in fact just clicking on &#039;resolve&#039; extends the finalization period by 5 days and once in the resolution center the order will no longer auto finalize.<br /><br />All of this is covered in the SR wiki and it is ultimately your responsibility to avail yourself of the facts. Personally I move all orders into resolution when they are getting close to the 17 day mark, just post a polite proposal requesting an extension to allow for shipping times, something that I think is I think common practice for most people using SR.<br /><br />Your stats will repair over time as you make more successful transactions, at least you now know how the system works.

				Out of over 400 packages shipped I have only ever had 5 people express issues with their order. Four of the five contacted me right away and I resolved all 4. The fifth guy waited until almost auto-finalize to dispute the order asking for %100 refund without stating the reason why or even contacting me in any way. Guess who didn&#039;t get a %100 refund or have his order resolved? Most vendors are not dicks and will go above and beyond to placate you, but it starts with actually communicating with them. If we don&#039;t even know there is an issue how the heck are we suppose to resolve it? Your case required simply extending the auto-finalize date while communicating with the vendor which is exactly what my 5th customer should have done.

I will never understand why people don&#039;t educate themselves (even just the basics to begin with) on how things work prior to placing an order. I&#039;m sorry but some people don&#039;t seem to comprehend the potential dangers involved when you don&#039;t take the necessary precautions and minimize all your risks. There&#039;s a lot to learn but the dangling carrot can be hard to resist for some.

				Very good read.<br />Getting a full refund from a vendor hurts your stats as well, especially if you are new. I would advise buyer&#039;s to have multiple accounts, in case a situation bags you.<br />Case in point, you make a bunch of small orders, then place a large one. The vendor clearly is not responding, people are not getting product. You get a full refund. You will be explaining your stats to every vendor you buy from, from then on, until the numbers balance out.<br /><br />We must be vigilante. When new choose carefully, and start small.<br /><br />On the other hand, an experienced buyers with many purchases carries a larger weighting factor on the vendor&#039;s stats. Get a few long term buyers together, to edit the bad vendors ratings during a FE scam, and you can change the vendors stats quicker then support can bag them.<br /><br />Trust is the key, very hard thing on an anonymous site. When things go wrong we can have trouble keeping our cool. Me included :(<br /><br />Anyhow thanks for the reminder, never hurts to review some of the pitfalls. Nothing is perfect. Well except for Christy&#039;s weed ;D<br /><br />

				There&#039;s a counter very plainly on the &quot;orders&quot; page that tells you exactly when your order will auto-finalize.&nbsp; Why would you ever let that count all the way down if you never received your package?&nbsp; The resolve button is literally less than an inch away from that auto-finalize counter.&nbsp; That seems like a sensible thing to click right?&nbsp; There&#039;s even a counter on how many days until &quot;resolve&quot; unlocks by hovering your mouse over it.&nbsp; I think you even have a week or so AFTER &quot;resolve&quot; unlocks before your order finalizes so if you logged on to SR at all during that time your options would have been &quot;send money to a possible scammer&quot; or &quot;resolve&quot;... seems pretty obvious what you should do.

It seems every couple weeks there&#039;s another dolt who whines and bitches about their own mistake. It&#039;s not like the resolution center is some kind of hidden secret page that only privileged individuals have access to. These goddamned idiots need to quit their complaining and just not be fuckin retarded. I feel no sympathy for these stupid fucks.

When things come when they are supposed to -there is no problem.&nbsp; I am new; So go ahead and point and laugh: &quot;Ha, ha, ha -&gt; Newb&quot;<br /><br />Judging from your posts, I make more money than you so: &quot;Ha, ha, ha -&gt; yur poor&quot;.<br /><br />I also drove my car without reading the manual.
