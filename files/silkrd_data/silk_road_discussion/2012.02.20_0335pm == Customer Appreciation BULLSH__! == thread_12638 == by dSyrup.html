				I feel like I need to vent, sorry.<br /><br />I was so excited about the Customer Appreciation Sale that went down a while ago. However, it turned out to be the worst experience ever. I&#039;d like to share just a few problems I ran into and I would like to hear from anyone else who may have experienced any problems with the sale. Hopefully I&#039;m not the only one left holding my dick!<br /><br />I will not be mentioning names of vendors because I don&#039;t want biased opinions.<br /><br />Anyway, I stocked up my account with about 2g. Ordered some paste, pressies, &amp; herbs. The paste vendor sent messages wanting me to finalize early and the product has yet to arrive. The Herb never arrived either and I had finalized early because I had used the vendor before with no problems and only half the pills arrived. This rendered the sale pointless for me and actually ended up being detrimental to my bank account. I lost out on product and money and now I won&#039;t be able to buy as much product with the same amount of money because the sale is over.<br /><br />Can you taste the bitterness in me? I&#039;m sad &amp; furious &amp; disappointed...<br /><br />&nbsp;:&#039;(

				Doesn&#039;t account for the other 2 failed transactions...<br />Having money tied up in escrow is not fun. I also don&#039;t enjoy partial refunds.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: To clarify, I only finalized early for the Herb.

				Agreed.&nbsp; I feel bad for SR admins, they want to give back to the community hosting a sale, some vendors saw this as a scamming ploy for them.&nbsp; Scammers = Wastes of shit.

				:-( how could I forget? I had recently been burned by themunchies so when I saw those listings go up I was super weary and just watched the drama unfold.<br />Fortunately I was not a victim in regards to that but thank you for pointing it out because that&#039;s definitely the same time-frame.&nbsp; I wonder how many refunds or canceled orders there were from all those orders.

				I feel you.&nbsp; I just had an order cancelled tonight for some MDMA which I ordered on the customer appreciation weekend.&nbsp; The thing is, I&#039;ve never tried MDMA before and I wanted to give it a shot just to see how it felt.&nbsp; I&#039;m just a little pissed because I was looking forward to checking it out to see what it&#039;s all about (sorry, i&#039;m tripping right now and having a hard time expressing myself) so why would someone waste my time with a fucking bogus listing and not deliver?&nbsp; Why are people such fucking pricks?&nbsp; Why can&#039;t people just be cool?&nbsp;
