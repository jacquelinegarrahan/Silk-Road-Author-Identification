				This is clever, and very useful for me doing a research project on SR. Greenberg is the most cited person in my essay I think!

				<br />It seems this article is a &#039;fuck you&#039; to governments and conservative views everywhere.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; <br />But it invites some challenges from others who will put us to the test after reading this.<br /><br />

				What the Hell... are these dates accurate?&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall him posting that much in September or October of 2012.&nbsp; I was sort of lurking then though; still, what&#039;s with all the quotes from that 2-3 month period?&nbsp; Very odd.&nbsp; I wonder if that&#039;s just when he did most of his research... makes one wonder.

				I wonder how much this newb got paid just to insert all of DPR&#039;s quote&#039;s on a page then slap a Forbes tag at the top...<br /><br />No news is good news, I have always heard...

				Wow, just saw this post after already bumping an old DPR forum topic which comprised the last, and my favorite, quote of the Forbes article.<br /><br />Topic provides some background on DPR&#039;s founding of SR and if there&#039;s only one quote you read from that Forbes article, it should be this one!<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=16070

You would think that an organization such as Forbes would have better people working for them. I don&#039;t even think that he could make the cut at freakin&#039; IGN, so why is he covering the topics that he does for Forbes?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Arguably you make a compelling argument, but at the same time I&#039;m only so upset about this because it introduced me to something I was unaware of until now: how absurdly well spoken, intelligent, and in agreement with my personal philosophy DPR is. Until now I didn&#039;t realize the truly noble intentions behind the scenes at SR, and I am more impressed now than I have ever been.
