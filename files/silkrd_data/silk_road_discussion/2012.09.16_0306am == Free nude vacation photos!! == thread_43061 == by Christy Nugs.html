				Sorry about pulling a pine but as long as i have ur attention!!<br /><br />As i was upgrading my tor this am I thought to myself, wow its been a couple <br />months since I have donated to the torproject. I personally chose to donate with<br />bitcoins because of my situation but they accept almost any form of donation.<br /><br />But wait!!! I started thinking that I never remembered seeing any thread here on<br />the forums about supporting the very operation that keeps us all safe on the road.<br />Exit nodes / nodes are closing because of the cost of bandwith and I know we <br />dont want any slower tor surfing. They accept from 5 dollar donations to as much <br />as u can personally afford.<br /><br />So next time u enjoy ur product of choice think about how u got it safely -<br />delivered straight to your door!! Kick em a couple bucks people - we will all <br />benifit greatly from a stronger safer network...:)<br /><br />Thanks for reading and supporting Tor;<br />Christy Nugs<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; tor donation addys:<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en<br /><br />https://www.torservers.net/donate.html<br /><br />http://noisetor.net/<br /><br />http://www.ccc.de/en/support<br /><br />Pick ur point of interest!!&nbsp; :P

				Just made mine too Christy....&nbsp; Good call.<br /><br />Donations won&#039;t make the network &#039;faster&#039; per se, but it does float the project, which may include public awareness, which increases usage, which increases the number of possible nodes.<br /><br />Which makes it faster.&nbsp; yesss..

				more bandwith would make it a little faster but u r correct im afraid.<br />and yes my month limit is on hold for a couple months so as soon<br />as i finish moving i will be back up and running u and other new people will be<br />able to order.<br /><br />good job guys it can&#039;t hurt - seriously its one of the few things i donate to.

				Well I might as well ask an unrelated question for ya Christy, since your post also wasn&#039;t related to the title :-P<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard great things about your product, would love to try it sometime! However, I notice you have a most unusual requirement: you only accept users that have been around since January?! If I could go into a time machine and join last year I totally would, but I&#039;m out of luck. Would my 0% refund rate and 6 transactions in the past 2 months be enticing at all? I will throw all, ALL the bitcoins at you if you say yes :-)

				donated, then googled &quot;nude pics of C Nugs&quot; and ended up with naked pictures of Prince Harry-good idea on the donation, (though I keep thinking of the $1 a day African Children Scams on TV)&nbsp; As far as the pics, that is just not right,,,was hoping to get something to compensate for the expectation I had when clicking the link

				i have nothing against liberalism or social democracy but there&#039;s a difference between social democracy and &quot;do not use riseup.net services to advocate support for capitalism&quot; which runs directly counter to my agorist beliefs and the beliefs of most people in the liberal european world i imagine<br /><br />choosing not to support riseup is a difficult decision for me since they also believe in a free society, equality, self-determination, and plenty of other cool stuff, not to mention that they provide hidden service email/xmpp for free<br /><br />like you said, anonymity, strange bedfellows and all that :)

				Funny you started this thread when you did, the bitcoin client was just updated today and adds greater TOR support from what I understand.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the info concerning TOR:<br /><br />https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/Tor.txt<br /><br />*Forgot to add that this version fixes the DNS leak from the older clients :)<br /><br />
