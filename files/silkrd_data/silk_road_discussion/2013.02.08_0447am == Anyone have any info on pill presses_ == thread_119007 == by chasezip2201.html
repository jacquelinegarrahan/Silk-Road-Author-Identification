				How heavily guarded are they in the sense that if you buy one online are you going to be put on a list?&nbsp; Anyone can recommend any?

				Can they be bought online?<br /><br />Would love to press my own!<br /><br />Surely if you were pressing pills you would have to know someone that can make the pressing part for you without anyone else knowing?

				The trick is to order them from overseas and get them shipped in pieces.<br />Whole units especially on ebay, etc are watched but little metal machine pieces is nothing to worry about&nbsp; ;)

				IMPORTANT: IF YOU ARE IN AUSTRALIA DO NOT ORDER THE PILL PRESSES OFF EBAY THAT SAY ARE SHIPPED FROM WITHIN AUSTRALIA.<br /><br />Me and some of the boys I work with contacted 2 of the sellers listing these who confirmed the presses were already in Australia and would be shipped domestically (The smaller ones through Auspost and the larger ones through courier). An anonymous payment method was setup and 2 different presses from 2 different sellers were ordered to separate addresses controlled by us but not associated with our identity&#039;s in anyway.<br /><br />No controlled delivery was attempted however both addresses were raided by the police about 2 weeks later (both raids a couple of days apart), and the occupants of the houses were questioned about purchasing pill presses. Needless to say neither press arrived.<br /><br />Just a word of warning.

Okay I&#039;m so nervous because I bought it for my friend Peter who imports MDMA from other countries and sells all sorts of drugs - I&#039;ll call him right now and pretend that I want to buy from him so you see that I&#039;m not the bad guy!<br />B) Oh well you can&#039;t do shit, LE because I&#039;m only doing legal stuff and not taking drugs or anything that could be hidden behind the bookshel...oh shit...<br />C) I don&#039;t know what you are talking about - I want my lawyer.<br /><br />Ideas?<br />
