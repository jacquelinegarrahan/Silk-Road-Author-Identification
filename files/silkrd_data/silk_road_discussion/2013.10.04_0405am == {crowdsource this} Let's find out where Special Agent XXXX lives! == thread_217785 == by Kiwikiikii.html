				by resorting to violence, we become no better than the government swine we loathe so much. I hope Mr. tarbell lives a long, healthy life. Long enough to eventually realize his entire lifes work was in vain, once we eventually win this war on drugs and the DEA becomes obsolete and is disbanded

				Why would you pursue violence that way and rub salt on your wounds. Your posts could be attributed to aiding in the attempted murder of federal agents.<br /><br />Thats just dumb and especially writing on a forum about it.

				Ridiculous thread. For more reasons that even need to be spoken. Please open your eyes. Good ol&#039; Chrissy Tarbell is not the guy who brought SR and DPR (if Ulbright is DPR) down. Alot of the 3 letter agencies (and don&#039;t kid yourself, the NSA clearly helped &quot;off the books&quot;.. coincidental fake-id document seizure during routine USPS inspection from Canada anyone? Get real. You know the NSA did the FBI/DEA/Homeland Security more then a few solids in this case.. and that will always be one of their dirty little secrets).<br /><br />Just by being here you&#039;re already on a list. You want to on the Skinny Pete/Badger list? Or the fuckin Walter White list?<br /><br />Didn&#039;t think so..

By virtue of Tor and GPG, most of us are quite anonymous. If this were not the case, vendors who order from other vendors would thus have their addresses exposed and would have been busted a long time ago. Fearfully exaggerating the government&#039;s capabilities only incites panic and doesn&#039;t help anybody.<br /><br />Exposing personal information like the OP proposes has been an effective tactic for groups like Anonymous and might make agents think twice before infiltrating groups that cause no societal harm. I disagree with the notion that we would be &quot;stooping to their level,&quot; any more than punching back when someone is beating you up is &quot;stooping to their level.&quot; They&#039;ve declared war on us in their own words, with terms like &quot;War on Drugs.&quot; Self defense is a human right.

				i agree, if you think you can fight a violent oppressive regime without violence then just look at occupy and how far they got with that whole peaceful protest thing.<br /><br />this present regime will just ignore any peaceful opposition and then use violence when they decide they&#039;ve had enough or it gets too loud for their liking.
