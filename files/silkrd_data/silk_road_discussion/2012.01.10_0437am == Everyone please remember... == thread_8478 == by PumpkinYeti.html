				Well said. We&#039;re dealing in the black market here, people. We need to be more suspicious of what others say, especially when it can affect how and with whom we do business here.

				Every vendor has some bad reviews. There are some people who are just DICKS. There are also some great people on here. I have had some very good vibes from a lot of my customers. Most top 25 vendors have a couple bad reviews (a lot of which are likely bullshit, or rating bombs imo), and are stuck with 99s. I know I have 3, and that is the only thing keeping me from a 100 and I HATE IT. I recently worked back to a 100, and someone comes along and leaves me a 1/5 without even opening a resolution or sending a message. I imagine other vendors feel the same way... I take ratings very personally, and read every single one. <br /><br />It sucks to get a bad rating...all you can do is try to learn from it. <br /><br />Learn not to do business with assholes&nbsp; :P
