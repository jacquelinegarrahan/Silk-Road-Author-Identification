				I have ordered a kilo from somebody of a certain illegal substance.<br />Now, the postal service they are using is one I have never used before.<br />This is the latest information on the package:<br /><br />&quot;Awaiting customs clearance. Our delivery agent will contact you shortly.&quot;<br /><br />Why would a delivery agent ever contact me? If this is in fact a controlled delivery, and they call me, what should I say about the package to deny it?<br />Thanks.

				Yea, I can see why some red flags would be coming up on your end.<br /><br />I&#039;ll give you my take on the situation.<br /><br />I guess it depends on the method and reason of the &quot;delivery agent&quot; contacting you.<br />Since as you said its not a normal route of delivery it may have to switch &quot;Delivery agents&quot; once it hits your border. e.g. a different carrier which in turn will need a different tracking no. <br /><br />So all the update may be is letting you know that they will update you about the change in carrier and will update with new tracking info once it clears customs.<br /><br />So if they contact/update you with new tracking info it would probably be less of a red flag.<br />But if they contact you any other way trying to extract information from you, then its really suspect.<br /><br />So sit it out and see what comes next.

				I believe that it kind of translates out to saying they&#039;ll notify you when they receive the package from customs.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think customs would update the postal so they could update you via internet about an interception.&nbsp; International packages get stuck in customs without anyway of really tracking it.&nbsp; They&#039;re saying they&#039;ll let you know when it&#039;s able to be tracked again.&nbsp; Or you could just play it safe and burn everything.

				Do you actually think the postal service are going to let you know there is going to be a problem with your package at customs which will lead to a controlled delivery? <br /><br />Seriously? <br /><br />They are going to basically let you know they are coming, giving you time to get rid of all evidence and get a good back story and shit? <br /><br />I can&#039;t actually believe that you&#039;d think that. The chances are they&#039;ve caught it and it will be confiscated and the LE will come knocking for some questions. At this point, where they probably know you know the package is under investigation they aren&#039;t going to bother with a controlled delivery.<br /><br /><br />If they plan on a controlled delivery (well.. If the LE decide thats what they&#039;ll do when they&#039;ve been notified.. ) They are not going to be like:<br /><br />&#039;Hello sir, how are you? Just letting you know we&#039;ve handed your package over to the LE and they plan on knocking your door down in a controlled delivery in about 3 days. Probably about 9am as well. <br /><br />Enjoy your free time MR soon to be a convict!&#039;<br /><br /><br />If this isn&#039;t just BS, then can I add that if you have been checking the tracking with a normal browser, that&#039;s already a bit of proof that you were expecting a package (your IP will be logged). So, if they are smart enough to look at that, then you need another excuse other than &#039;what package do you mean sir??&nbsp; ::) &#039;.<br /><br />Again, like always: Keep your mouth shut, get rid of anything incriminating and say nothing other than your name without consulting an attorney. <br /><br />Just remember you&#039;ve got to be extra careful now, if they get the slightest bit of evidence you could be going away for a long time. A kilo would be considerable jail time depending on what drug it was.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />

				How would they contact him? Do they have his number?&nbsp; Right there it sounds unlikely. Sounds like an attention complex. I&#039;ve had a package seized by customs, and they just sent me a letter inside the envelope my stuff was supposed to come in, which read something like &quot;Someone mailed you something that is on our banned list of items and we&#039;ve confiscated it, if you&#039;d like to appeal this, contact this office withing 14 days, otherwise it will be destroyed. <br />Then went on to list the law &quot;Section this, and paragraph that, states that yaddda yadda yadda controlled substances, etc. <br /><br />- Agent Just Doinmahjob<br />US Dept of Homeland Security<br />Borders Enforcement <br /><br />Never heard from them again.

				There&#039;s probably nothing to worry about. <br /><br />The US Postal service fucks up a lot. Especially with international exchanges. I can assure you they would never let you know they are coming to bust you in advanced.<br /><br />Worst Case, Stash your shit somewhere, wait a few days, don&#039;t sign for the package. Shouldn&#039;t be ordering a kilo that requires signature anyways.<br /><br />Even so, I once had a large international shipment that the postal guys confused and they left a pink slip for me in my mailbox saying I had to come pick it up at the post office. Super Paranoid, I had a backstory and everything ready. I went, and got it, no problems at all, the USPS is just fucking retarded. As long as your vendor knows what he is doing, you should be fine.<br /><br />Rest Assured, the USPS may be stupid but they&#039;re not stupid enough to let you know you&#039;re about to be busted.<br /><br />LE will either:<br />Try to get you to sign for the package, likely at which point your house will be surrounded, and multiple LE will be in the postal truck, you can usually see if there&#039;s more than 2 post guys.<br />Or:<br />They will bust down your door without warning, which is unlikely unless somebody locally tipped you off as ordering. I do not think it&#039;s likely theyll bust down your door just because an illegal package has your name on it. Anybody can send a package to anybody, and it simply would not hold up in court.

				Ordering KGs international? Ok. You have good grasp of international mail and customs clearance correct?<br /><br />When tracking updates there are pre-made track update reason, when package arrive into customs they scan and update with preset reason, &quot;package in destination customs awaiting clearance&quot; is normal update. sound like person delivering used freight forward company of customs broker, they have custom track update message and add &quot;delivery agent will call you if needed&quot;. &quot;agent&quot; does not mean POLICE. LOL<br /><br />like customer service AGENT. it mean your package got to destination customs arrival and is waiting to be inspected or passed on like every other package that come in and if need more tax paid or have delivery problem the forwarder contact you confirm address or get tax paid. Or your container of cargo need schedule truck pickup from forwarding facility then agent call to schedule.<br /><br />LOL.&nbsp; :o

				If buying bulk or shipping through express carriers (DHL, FEDEX, UPS, etc) you only use drops that are in no way connected to you.&nbsp; You should also expect some of the packages to get caught.&nbsp; It is a numbers game.

				When going through a courier such as UPS OR DHL coming in to canada it&#039;ll usually go through a clearing house of sorts. <br /><br /><br />This is where they figure out how much their going to charge you on duties and taxes. <br /><br /><br />This is normal an agent might contact you because a lot of duties or taxes are to be paid on the package. Or they want your asss.<br /><br />Got my tracking number yet?
