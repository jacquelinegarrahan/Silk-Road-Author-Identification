				Ok I have been in talks with DPR and he suggested i post this the existing thread however I think it will be lost in all the messages in response just to the Original Post<br /><br />Here is my though I like the current feeback system and I also understand the need for the new feedback system (now in place) due to people like me selling Digital Goods it was certainly needed and even people racking up there own feedback HOWEVER I don&#039;t think it is simply enough <br /><br />and here is why lets say hypothetically I become a vendor I sell I dunno 50 grams of I dunno say MDMA I rack up descent &quot;cred&quot; now I decide I want to sell&nbsp; a much more expensive drug and desirable drug say it&#039;s H I can now use my cred to rip people <br /><br />Here is my proposed new feedback system<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />It should still be designed similarly to the way it is right now (the new feedback system)<br />However it should be broken down so that a User is rated on the product in each individual category and reflected as such this should refine how and what the vendor has sold and what there rank is in that category&nbsp; and also the individual items should be ranked based on feedback especially on vendors that sell the same item like 300 times going through page after page of feedback can be challenging <br /><br />subsequently a vendor should also not be able to sell some bomb weed and then sell some shitty K and then the feedback be based as a whole it should be broken down so a buyer can make a informed choice<br /><br />ALSO Another issue arises say a vendor does 45 sales a day he decides after selling some awesome weed he is going to buy some cut mdma and flip it on SR for some profit 90% of people don&#039;t bitch and complain but 10% does what stops the vendor from removing that item and then making a new one the exact same so the page based stats are gone and now a buyer is forced to rifle through a ass ton of feedback to find info on a item that&#039;s not listed anymore<br /><br /><br />SR/ DPR Is trying to create somthing wonderful but he has to &quot;balance&quot; privacy carefully but what i don&#039;t understand is why .. if i buy herion or weed or crack or coke why does it matter if another vendor knows what i have bought im a online persona I honestly think vendors are getting the short end of the stick a bit in regards to making a informed transaction between a vendor and a buyer because there are infact rippers on both sides<br /><br />So i would love to hear your feedback in regards to my proposal and then see if you can make some additions to how we can tweak it a bit then I can break it down chop it up submit my proposal further to SR and see what happens maybe he likes the idea and creates another thread takes another vote and impliments<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I do not care if someone is the #2 seller on SR or the number #300 seller on SR all I care about is the feedback they receive from previous buyers for the product I am interested in. This is not some competition to see who is number one, just look around you some of the biggest (#1) companies in the world are ones who I would never buy from because of their unethical business practices all in the name of being making money and being #1.<br /><br />The best sellers are always more interested in providing quality service and products to their customers at fair prices not being thought of by certain people to be a top 10 seller on the site. If vendors spend their time satisfying customers instead of worrying about what is essentially a meaningless ranking they have things will go well for them.<br /><br />As we have seen in the past on SR some of the top ranked sellers on this site did a cash grab when things started to go bad for them (including things outside SR) so where they rank should mean little to the average buyer. Smart buyers only care about the feedback (especially recent) vendors have received from their customers not some meaningless rank based on unknown formulas they probably cannot understand.

				Something else I&#039;d like to bring up is dealing with buyers leaving retarded feedback.&nbsp; 99% of SR users are great to deal with, but every now and then there&#039;s a few who just take the fucking cake.&nbsp; For example, someone bought a digital product off me.&nbsp; The listing specifically said it&#039;s for Americans and I can&#039;t guarantee it can be used international, but he orders it anyway and gives me a 2, saying, &quot;Great for Americans but not for The Netherlands.&quot;&nbsp; Well no fucking shit, that&#039;s why I wrote the warning in the item&#039;s description!&nbsp; Currently I have no protection against shit like this, and I&#039;ve even messaged support several times with no clear response.&nbsp; I could go on with more ridiculous bullshit other people have left on my account, but I digress. <br /><br />

				- as already suggested the current seller #1 - 250 ratings are meaningless and redundant as there are a real mix of products and services sold and its the &quot;rating&quot;<br />&nbsp; &amp; 2-way feedback {seller&lt;--&gt; buyer} per category thats of use.<br /><br />-&nbsp; there are a loads of SR suggestions regarding status&#039;, flags to indicate when sellers are available, data needs to be exposed and summarised all of which will require<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;extra code and interface design; we also dont want to micro manage sellers nor buyers but both sides need to see at a glance what action to take or where some<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;product is in the process, obviously the interface shouldn&#039;t be cluttered with colours and buttons -so a balance of usability Versus simplicity.<br /><br /><br />- more privacy issues: bulk / bigger orders between vendors placed thru the normal escrow system (?) should possibly be excluded from public visibility<br />&nbsp; as this exposes distribution that could be exploited for the purpose of profiling etc.<br /><br /><br />

				thank you for putting the time/energy into continually improving the process.&nbsp; Having the vendor rated for each category is a great idea.&nbsp; I think it will separate out the top dogs even further.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how many times I will find a ton of info on the vendor for one product, but almost nothing on another product.&nbsp; I want to buy the best product, not the best vendor.&nbsp; Although, my favorite vendors are my favorite for the reason.

				This site seems to be getting along just fine, I have been using for about 2 months and thought originally all the ratings, feedback and forums were totally useless.&nbsp; I even got scammed on what I thought should have been a good vendor 100% 40+ transactions, rapidly went down to 50% from 50+ transactions and then gone without a trace, and a suspect delivering one product.<br /><br />Now, I feel I can read a vendor with a large number of transactions and actually know the vendor almost as well as if he was in the corner store, it is a matter of reading everything about the vendor, and then filtering out the bullshit.&nbsp; <br /><br />We wouldn&#039;t want great vendors stats with turnover by product, giving too much info.&nbsp; When I was first on this site I wasn&#039;t even sure if the whole site wasn&#039;t some scam.&nbsp; But now after receiving several orders I know it isn&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is just a matter of reading between the lines, sometimes under the lines and knowing what you want from the vendor.<br /><br />It is fun it is anarchic way, reading through the little squabbles, people complaining about nothing, but everything adds to the story.&nbsp; I know have complained about these things recently but am now laughing at them.<br /><br />So all you need to do is take a bit of time, read the feedback, the forums, and if in doubt just place a small order.&nbsp; I dont believe in asking vendors questions - unless their is something unusual in their listing - let them be busy filling our order, instead of wether they wont some in Fiji on their first order to finalise early (most will).&nbsp; You may be scammed once or twice, but hopefully never under the same circumstances.<br /><br />And read the harm reduction forums, there are some quite fun threads there, some good squabbles, but amongst it some good advice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Remember we here for a good time (hopefully a long time)

				A problem I see is the rating in percentage and not the amount of sales. It should be like eBay.<br /><br />When you see a list of sellers, most of them has a 100 next to them. If a guy has ONLY ONE good sale (could be fake) he gets a 100 next to his name. If a guy has sold hundreds of products and has a few 4/5 his name will have a 98 next to it. Actual system is useless in that sense.<br /><br />Another problem is the feedback. How accurate could it be? EVERY seller should have a forum thread with subtopics for each product. One for Weed, one for mdma...

				an interesting point ;-<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12361.msg125024#msg125024<br /><br />&quot;If a seller is successful at selling larger orders of illegal items, their quality shipping and compared risk factor should count towards something.<br />Sellers who deal only in Digital goods and legal goods are not taking any risk, really, so their products will always arrive... whereas if someone is selling H, has a 100 rating and they regularly ship to places like Australia, they should get a higher rating.&nbsp; I know this isn&#039;t exactly what DPR is doing, but digital goods and services, and legal items also tend to be less expensive than ounces of blow or H... so this will work!<br />Thanks DPR for being on the ball!&quot;<br /><br /><br />-&nbsp; there&#039;s more risk in selling drugs but still requires technical skill and know how to sell eBooks or services -they are just very different models; can you measure how<br />&nbsp; much effort has gone into formulating an electronic or computer service? -yes on the surface its being sold for a fraction of the selling price of some drugs but all the<br />&nbsp; preparation has gone on behind the scene
