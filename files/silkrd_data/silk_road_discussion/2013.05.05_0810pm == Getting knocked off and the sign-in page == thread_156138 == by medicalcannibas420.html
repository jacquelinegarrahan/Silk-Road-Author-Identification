				This has happened in the past - the 3-character captcha and getting logged out randomly.&nbsp; Same kind of thing then - just a glitch from some server work.&nbsp; They&#039;re getting most of these things ironed out, but some will take longer than others, and they can&#039;t just roll everything back because there is still the possibility that the attacker will return.&nbsp; Still, let me know if this continues happening over the next day or two.

				Anybody else having huge problems with Escrow? I have had several customers finalize and my account balance just keeps going down. I don&#039;t know how this is possible since my PIN is locked and won&#039;t be reset for a long while. As of right now, I&#039;m out about $500 despite my customers and myself doing everything exactly by the book. The worst part is that Vendor Support hasn&#039;t even open my messages about the subject so basically their is no indication that the problem will be fixed or that I will ever get my money out of SR.

				I&#039;m having the same problem with the added bonus of having to type my credentials in 2-3 times to get logged in! I KNOW I&#039;m typing in the correct info and each time I get the login screen I double-check the URL to make sure I&#039;, not being phished so I guess it&#039;s a glitch.

				happening all the time for me.. almost rendering it unusable for me.&nbsp; no rhyme or reason to when it does it either.&nbsp; I remember scout saying that DPR was aware of the problem but to have the mods keep a eye on it and let him know in a few days if it&#039;s still happening.&nbsp; Being in IT myself, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to mysteriously go away on it&#039;s own so hopefully he will look into the issue now, as opposed to waiting a few days.&nbsp; Then again, he could still be trying to catch up on sleep :)

				DPR is constantly working on the site and is still cautious in case the attacker returns.&nbsp; So it is entirely possible that during these changes the log-out issue could be fixed.&nbsp; If it&#039;s not, then DPR will look into it more closely.&nbsp; However, he&#039;s aware of the problem and has asked only to be informed if it continues in the next day or so.
