				Hey guys.. I found a website that is now accepting paypal and CC&#039;s in exchange for bitcoins. <br /><br />It almost looks as if it was created just for SR.. But somehow I bet the person running it wouldn&#039;t want to be associated with this site in any way. Check it out:<br /><br />http://quickbitcoins.x10.bz/<br /><br />I was doing some checking around did a couple test orders. His current rates seem to be $15 + 15% but new users can use the code &quot;bitmeupscotty&quot; for half off the $15 processing fee on the first order. The site even offers gift certificate codes which might be useful to those who sell BTC on SR. Paypal has been known to come down on bitcoin sites so we should probably keep this quiet if we want to keep this service around. I mean.. Come on.. It should only take, what, 1-2 weeks to get a decent credit card processor up? ;-)

				How could he be scamming? He&#039;s using a verified paypal account liked to a real name and bank account. You dont enter CC information on their website at all. Plus he&#039;s got his real name plastered all over the site. It looks like there&#039;s a phone number listed too. Wonder what happens if you call it? I bet he&#039;s just cheap.

				Haha.. NO way. Why would someone post on the SR forums in a way that makes something like that obvious? Why would someone ever say that they are a person like that.. Especially in a place like SR?&nbsp; Especially when a website like that has real information on it?<br /><br />*wooooosh*

Take this shit somewhere else mate, t we have no time for scammers here.<br /><br />If its not a scam, don&#039;t make it look like one. Be honest, don&#039;t leave fake reviews. And let the people decide for themselves. Paypal &amp; CC in my opinion would not be a very good idea. You are linking real information with an anonymous currency. If the shit hits the fan, they know who you are. <br /><br />Have a good day.

				I second those who says that the guy running the site is you.<br />Still, a lousy attempt of scamming or a way to get you scammed, as both methods supports chargebacks to not mention your account will be locked as soon as PayPal gets the notice you&#039;re dealing in Bitcoins.

				Think about this for a second. Maybe the person isn&#039;t even attempting to hide who they are but doesn&#039;t want to directly say because they are on Silkroad. He might do that by pretending to be shill.<br /><br /><br />COME ON GUYS YOU&#039;RE SMARTER THAN THIS.<br /><br />Anyway, chargebacks aren&#039;t an issue if the owner of that site verifies everything. I bet he&#039;s even got his first order.

				Chargebacks are definitely an issue. It&#039;s one of the reasons most of the bitcoin dealers don&#039;t accept it as a medium of exchange. <br /><br />Good luck. Whomever he is, he&#039;s gonna need it.

				If it&#039;s not a scam, I hope iamtheone realizes that he is violating every credit card&#039;s terms and conditions. You can&#039;t use credit to purchase Bitcoins, or any other online currency. PayPal will also not allow this.<br /><br />WHy do you think nobody accepts credit cards? Do you think you are the first person to try it? Somebody would have done this the first day all this stuff was invented.<br /><br />But, your site looks shady for a number of reasons: for one, your exchange rate does not differ substantially from the other ones. If you were selling Bitcoins, you would definitely be selling them for higher, because you are taking a risk using credit cards and PayPal, and taking a risk competing with all the other Bitcoin dealers.<br /><br />I&#039;m surprised that nobody mentioned that he could be just fishing for credit card numbers and PayPal account logins...

If anyone actually falls for this then they don&#039;t deserve their BTC.<br /><br />Do you think anyone.. and I mean anyone, would use this dodgy as fuck site, when they can just do a bank transfer to mtgox/whoever and put it through bitcoin fog? <br /><br />Jesus man, if you&#039;re going to scam people at least do it intelligently. This just makes you look like a cretin. And you actually spent the time setting up the site and your bullshit story, HAHAHAH

				Yes, but if it&#039;s kept small and flies under paypal&#039;s radar it wont be a problem. Not only that but his news update says that he&#039;s switching to authorize.net as his CC processor in a couple of weeks. Also, if you look, the CC information is entered on PAYPAL&#039;s site, not his, therefore he couldn&#039;t collect any of that information. Also, his price of bitcoins isn&#039;t higher, but his 15% service charge is. It looks like most others charge at most 9%..

Also, if you look, the CC information is entered on PAYPAL&#039;s site, not his, therefore he couldn&#039;t collect any of that information. Also, his price of bitcoins isn&#039;t higher, but his 15% service charge is. It looks like most others charge at most 9%..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />uh, bitinstant/trustcash charges a straight 5% and its not some random shady website that makes you fill out any kind of form.

				Well, I just took a while to take a second look at the site. 1st it states in the FAQ they won&#039;t accept Paypal. Then this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Q). Is this a scam?<br /><br />A). No - but don&#039;t take out word for it! Please see our reviews here [placeholder for review thread]. There are a lot of scammers out there in the Bitcoin world, and it&#039;s best to keep one&#039;s guard up.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What or where is the &quot;[placeholder for review thread]&quot;?!&nbsp; ;D<br />Other than that they use the &quot;I&#039;m a scam&quot; layout:<br /><br />Lousy graphics and broken layout - why bother if the site is to disappear in short term?<br />Red text in the middle - catches the eye of the duck...<br /><br />Chances are, you gave them all your CC info and shortly after it magically shows up for sale at some carding site...

				-THREAD LOCKED-<br /><br />It&#039;s plain to see there is little more to be said on the subject.<br />No other payment methods besides Bitcoin are allowed on SR. The service being advertised is completely outside of Silk Road and may put a person using it in danger.<br />-sSh-
