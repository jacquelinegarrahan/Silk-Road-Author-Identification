				I have made a few purchases here but I was wondering if there was something that had a quicker turn around. I am sick of waiting 3 days for my money to become available on Dwolla. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks!

				I&#039;ve been using bitmarket / paypal and didn&#039;t mind paying a bit extra for the (relative) convenience, but paying extra (over SR prices) to fulfil buy orders<br />then have to put the money in peoples&#039; accounts just seems a bit much...<br /><br />Any other suggestions on the best way for an impatient person in the EU (UK) to buy BC without paying ridiculous transfer fees?

				Sorry should add to that that bitmarket have stopped doing paypal due to scams, which is fair enough I always thought there was that possibility just never had any trouble myself. <br /><br />Just can&#039;t be arsed to wait a week to get some bloody currency, lol

				I too have used bitcoinbux a few times and they&#039;re very fast. Good to have a WU-&gt;BTC exchanger in the US. Also wm-center and nanaimogold are very fast.

				If you&#039;re in the states you can just bring cash to any chase or western union bank and deposit it straight to www.exchangebitcoins.com.&nbsp; They don&#039;t charge any fee for the deposit and you get your money same day (as soon as you email them a copy of the deposit slip)

				Add another vote of confidence for exchangebitcoins.com. I transferred $185 on a Monday night right before my branch closed at 7 and they still got there less than an hour later.

				exchangebitcoins.com is deffinatley the fastest. just a matter of minutes if depositing cash. the fees may seem a liitle high compared to other methods though. $1 or 1 percent transaction.

				I have to say (like many others), exchangebitcoins.com works like a charm. I was having issues getting funds into Dwolla even after making verifications and waiting 5 days for it to finalize. Jumped onto exchange bitcoins, started the process on the website which told me step by step how to deposit the cash at a local bank. Took a pic of the receipt with my phone, sent it over. About an hour later (10am) the funds were available and moments later I had all my bitcoins. <br /><br />Hope this helps
