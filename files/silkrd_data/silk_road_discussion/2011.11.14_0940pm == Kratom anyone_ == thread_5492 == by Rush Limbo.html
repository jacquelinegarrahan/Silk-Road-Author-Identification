				I&#039;ve tried it twice and both times it was like a mild speedball. It was very enjoyable and I&#039;ll definitely do it again if the opportunity presents itself.

				Hey man, never tried oxy but I&#039;ve tried kratom and it gave me a nice chilled high. It combines fantastically with weed, I&#039;m not one for opiates but it did give me a nice day dreamy type nod, more than any high end weed has done on its own. Very relaxed, mild euphoria, creative mind and a great ongoing motivated mood.<br /><br />In short, it works. It can work too well in that if you dose too often you&#039;ll get addicted similar to (but not as fierce as) opiate addiction. If you buy it, buy from a reputable vendor. There are the kratom pies but I think they&#039;re hit and miss. Try the standardized 15x extract. I had 1 gram with OJ and was feeling good! Make sure you build up though, the first time I done it, I done 2g of the 15x extract and all I wanted to do was puke. A couple of weeks later I went to .5g and got not a lot. 1g of the 15x extract every now and then seems to do the trick pretty damn well.<br /><br />There&#039;s loads of info on it on the regular web, read up on effects, the compound mitragynine and dosing, choose a good source and go from there!

				It depends. Sometimes it&#039;s good. Sometimes not. Some years ago it gave me a very strong tingling. Which was really nice. And you could easily think about past memories and think them trough again. But today it seems, that it is hard to get good Kratom.<br /><br />I prefer to mix some varieties. Red Vein is good. It seems, that a mix is often better, than just one pure sort.<br />But even if i can&#039;t find good Kratom, i always have this effects:<br />- Positive thinking<br />- I like to lie in pure dark, and sometimes just listen to Sherlock Holmes or something<br />- Boring stuff becomes more fun<br /><br />It&#039;s not that strong, more subtle. But some years ago, it had a very good opiate feeling.

				As with any plant crop, potency varies in regard to specific growing condition and plant genetics. Every once in awhile a bunk batch hits the market.&nbsp; As others have said- it does work. There are some vendors offering standardized extracts of mitragynine. My personal preference is to mix ~.25g of an 8% mitragynine with a couple grams of ground and sifted plain leaf. The combo is a little more enjoyable than the sum of its parts. ymmv, but enjoy.

				I use it regularly.<br /><br />It is not nearly as strong as oxy.<br /><br />It&#039;s effects are fairly mild, but you get an opiate like euphoria AND an energy boost (aka a weak legal speedball).<br /><br />I take em all the time before work and I SMASH through the day&#039;s work cuz work just don&#039;t bother me at the time and I got energy to spare.<br /><br />Be cautious, however, there are so many &#039;strains&#039; if you will that some vendors are simply trying to get the most coin out of you by touting bali over blah blah.<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t pay the ridiculous prices some vendors want, MAKE THEM GO BANKRUPT BY NOT BUYING FROM THEM.&nbsp; I say this cuz I get mine for $300/kilogram, and I see kratom being sold for $60 an ounce !!! <br /><br />You don&#039;t need to make the tea, that&#039;s what i did the first few times, and now that I just eat ground up kratom i can say there is no difference side from the huge waste of time making the tea is.&nbsp; <br /><br />On that note, purchase 000 size capsules from ebay or some shit, and fill em with ground up kratom powder (I use an allen key to crush the kratom down in the pill and thus jam as much as I can in the pill), and any issue you might have with &#039;taste&#039; (I don&#039;t understand that, it doesn&#039;t taste bad :D) are resolved.&nbsp; It&#039;s also helpful cuz i&#039;ll make up say 50 in a half hour and then I have a tonne I can just bring a few to work with me and pop em there, no prep, nothing special, just grind it, fill pills.<br /><br />Been taking kratom for like 3 years now, if you are careful you will not become addicted.&nbsp; By careful I mean do not do it everyday, leave notable periods before using it again (I only take it when I know its going to be a rough/long day at work).<br /><br />Do not buy the &#039;standardized&#039; extracts (that gets me cuz standarized to what? ISO standards? I don&#039;t think so), they are FAR more expensive then just bulk kratom, and give the exact same effect with you running out much faster.&nbsp; Like I said above, filling pills makes it just as easy as trying to justify getting an extract on that basis.&nbsp; My experience with extracts is that they are not very good actually, and I def. won&#039;t swallow the prices they ask again.<br /><br />Kratom is good stuff and I dunno why ppl gotta hate on it.&nbsp; It&#039;s LEGAL, and gives you an opiate like high without the tiredness and its cheap.&nbsp; Granted it&#039;s only about on par with a mild to mild/moderate perc trip, its still yummy opiate bliss regardless.&nbsp; Besides, there have been times where i&#039;ll get right fucked from kratom (like a wave of euphoria on par with oxys), perhaps my state of mind, eating, not eating etc.&nbsp; The same thing has happened with opiates, sometimes i&#039;ll just get blindsided by a dose that usually does fuck all to me.

				always wanted to try it. But like quinone said, it was always too expensive, costing more than weed! I havent noticed if anyone on SR is selling Kratom?<br /><br />Workers used to chew on the leaves for energy, so i cant imagine it tasting that bad
