				Hello all,<br /><br />I wonder how long SR survives...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the technical things and the onion network at all...<br /><br />But would like to know, if it could be &quot;busted&quot; or forced going offline... <br /><br />What you think? Are we going to have it for years or longer?<br /><br />I ask because I don&#039;t know the &quot;street scene&quot; - and SR is a blessing if you don&#039;t want to buy on the street

				I don&#039;t know if the Silk Road will be around for years, but I think we can safely assume that the online anonymous black marketplace, in whatever form it takes, is here to stay. It&#039;s too attractive, convenient, profitable, and, comparably, safe for this phenomenon to disappear any time in the near future. I hope :) AB.

				huh, another how-long-SR-will-last, thread.<br /><br />Noone can tell for sure. But the fact that DEA knows and cant do shit about it (in combination with all the advertisments of SR through media) to me its translated in 2 ways.<br />1. DEA itself is SR (lol as much as u want) <br />2. SR is taking all the actions needed to be kept unknown, and untouchable.<br /><br />So yes it will last forever, even if it comes down, there other black markets.<br /><br />but worst case, if tor dies, SR dies.

				It&#039;s all up to us.&nbsp; DPR did his part.<br /><br />I see the future being a torrent anon network that uses each user connection as a bridge/proxy/exit node.&nbsp; <br />There is no way government can keep up to technology.&nbsp; At some point it becomes irresponsible spending to bust people for non violent crime at such a huge expense.&nbsp; Taxpayers would never support that kind of spending.&nbsp; At least not this one.<br /><br />We can self regulate and self arm ourselves with the exact same tools the government is using. That&#039;s the beauty of the system.&nbsp; The government shops at the same stores as we do.&nbsp; They don&#039;t develop special software for the government or anything like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;It would get leaked out to the hacker crowd anyway and fall in the wrong hands.&nbsp; Just like nuclear plans did eventually. <br /><br />Thanks to groups like anonymous, we have soldiers in this war.&nbsp; Soldiers motivated to stick it to the man and many are working on the inside providing back doors and passwords .&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not a fair fight at the moment. The government can&#039;t crack TOR.&nbsp; The people won&#039;t support it either.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sooner or later we will all be labelled here as cyber terrorists who are exploiting the nations postal system. Providing techniques for terrorists to attack us with.&nbsp; &nbsp;Deadly ricin poison in the mail is just a start.&nbsp; Terrorists will eventually attack us on our soil through our postal system using the same exploits we all enjoy here.&nbsp; &nbsp;At that point, the war will be even.<br /><br />Our postal system is going to get locked down pretty soon.&nbsp; It&#039;s postal system that taxpayers will gladly pay to upgrade to protect everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;So you see, they will get us in that angle.&nbsp; Not a little drug website selling drugs.&nbsp; But a big postal exploit and overhaul .<br /><br /><br />

				I think we are asking the wrong question. Like top44 said, if TOR dies SR dies. But even more so important are BTC. With them being unregulated and not under control of the central banks, I believe BTC(or other crypto-currency) is what we have to worry about. Kill the BTC and you kill SR.
