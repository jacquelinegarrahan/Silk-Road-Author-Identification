				Yes I posted in Toni&#039;s thread. He is probably the one who fucked with me. I asked in his thread, how it was possible that his account said he only had 3 posts. In the thread he had posted using multiple accounts with the same name. I just thought something was glitching.

I think ill just leave it, but there is no greater truth then that. I haven&#039;t been that frightened since my last run in with LE. <br />When I saw the message in my inbox I shit bricks. If you really wanted to freak someone out, replicate someone&#039;s username using special characters, then post in the spam threads until you have the same post count as the person you are pretending to be. Create many accounts and spam to 100 so you can replicate the karma also. Then message the person or post as the person that would be some scary shit.<br />That&#039;s the next big scam. DPR sends messages to people telling them he needs some money and he will pay back ten fold :p<br />

				Cookie stealer?<br />I once wrote one of those and did very well hijacking user accounts on a forum but it was several years ago, don&#039;t know if these forums use cookies?<br />If they do then stealing a cookie is pretty easy; just need to get your target to click a link with a little javascript, if your really smart you can totally hide the javascript inside say an image location or something similar- the possibilities are endless.<br />But yeah my views the same as everyone elses, chill out man. Plus the forums are (thank fuck) totally independent from the main site and even if you use the same password for both the person with your account will not ever be able to see the password in plain text, at best they could maybe get the hash but even then unlikely. All they can do is use your account on the forums and thats it.<br />Probably just doing it for some entertainment and to fuck around with you. I wouldnt worry or try and scare everyone else here.
