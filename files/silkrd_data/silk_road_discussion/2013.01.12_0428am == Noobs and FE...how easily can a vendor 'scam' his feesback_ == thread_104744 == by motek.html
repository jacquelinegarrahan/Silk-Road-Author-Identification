				hey folks as you can see I&#039;m new here and after reading a number of threads I have a couple of noob questions to ask<br /><br />How accurate are vendor ratings?&nbsp; &nbsp;Sure the older vendors with heaps of feedback are probably real, but what about the newer vendors?&nbsp; <br /><br />Aside from searching for the vendor on these forums, to see what comments are floating about, what are some of the ways you long time silk roaders use to decide about a new vendor?<br /><br /><br />And on the other hand, although everyone says &quot;DONT FE&quot; . . . it appears easier said than done, with the old catcha-22....as a new buyer with no &#039;stats&#039; ... most of the vendors I&#039;d like to buy from insist on FE for buyers with less than 5-10 successful transactions ???<br /><br />What to do?&nbsp; ??? <br />&nbsp;Make a number of small buys with vendors who will accept a new members escrow? <br />the problem here is I may not want to buy many &#039;other&#039; products.&nbsp; <br /><br />And considering some vendors categorically state they will ONLY do business with a &#039;new&#039; buyer, if they FE&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Kind of stuck inbetween a rock and a hard place&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Has anyone ever considered a compromise?&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe something like &#039;half FE and the balance on delivery&#039; <br /><br />idk&nbsp; After having spent a couple of days looking at the vendor &#039;feedback&#039; and comments at SR around the forum, with most of the vendors I&#039;d like to buy from insisting on FE, and in their comments many/most of their customers are leaving comments such as &quot;FE for xxxx a trusted and reliable vendor&quot;&nbsp; and the like.... ???<br /><br /><br />Keeping in mind&nbsp; &quot;caveat emptor&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;aka&nbsp; &quot;let the buyer beware&quot; . . . I&#039;m sure in a few more months and with a few purchases up my sleeve (arm ::))&nbsp; &nbsp;I will bee able to answer my own questions<br /><br />but for the moment....any pro tips from the accomplished buyers here, about things like communication (what to say-what do they want to hear?) payment,&nbsp; and is it considered bad form to ask a vendor how it will be packaged?<br /><br />I understand a few of the myriad of ways shit could go wrong BUT I ALSO understand/know that if a reasonably &#039;sensible protocol&#039;&nbsp; is used by all involved, IME, the likelehood of the purchase arriving are right up there in the high 90%&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />I think I&#039;m still a little (a lot :o) blown out by the SR having only just discovered it...and I&#039;m kicking myself I didn&#039;t come a looking back in early &#039;11 when I first heard about it :-[<br /><br />I LOVE the thought that about the &#039;darknet&#039; is the closest thing we have today to the Wild West&nbsp; :o . . .&nbsp; 8) . . .&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />thanx EVERYONE here who are sharing the love.....and I hope any LE that may be lurking these fora....both learn some things AND maybe, just maybe, decide to open their own personal&nbsp; buyers account and get some good acid for all the good reasons folks take acid, to &#039;expand their consciousness&#039;s&#039;&nbsp; :o&nbsp; <br /><br />Now that would be cool.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; &nbsp;Hmmm get&#039;s one to thinking&nbsp; &#039;what if&#039; a strongly laced food/drink was given to the police station &#039;for the officers to share with thanx and appreciation&#039;&nbsp; :) yep! <br /><br /><br />

				Buy NBOMe&#039;s. It&#039;s super cheap and thus many vendors are willing to send new buyers small amounts.<br /><br />And it&#039;s fucking awesome.<br /><br />Peace.

				If you are domestic the vendor is more likely to send to you when you have no stats, as there is no customs to go through. Ordering the smallest amount the vendor offers when you have no stats is more likely to be accepted than ordering a larger amount and saying it didn&#039;t arrive. If you want a larger amount, offering to pay for tracked shipping will usually result in a sale regardless of stats. If you PM the vendor and show interest in the product, this usually helps with them accepting your order even if you have low stats. I don&#039;t recommend ordering a bunch of really cheap things, as when I see someone who&#039;s stats say they ordered 10 times before and their total spent equals $1.50... it looks really really bad, like you were hoping I wouldn&#039;t investigate your stats further by seeing the high order number there, it screams potential &quot;scammer&quot; to me. After you build up trust with the vendor by doing a good first transaction, they will normally allow a larger second order.

				No, thats a very silly idea, OP.<br /><br />DON&#039;T DO BUSINESS WITH FOOLS THAT MAKE YOU FE!<br /><br />The vender will no longer have a reason to ship your product, as the profit from stealing from you would be well worth the risk. It would take many transactions to achieve that same net profit.

				Ive noticed that a review I left, 3/5, did not show up on the vendors profile page. It seems if you delete the listing then you can remove the feedback from their profile page. There is probably other ways they manage it, but that is one that I&#039;ve spotted. <br /><br />However their score is still effected.

				Just to clarify a couple of points made which are incorrect as stated by nomad.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">, they aren&#039;t allowed to demand FE<br /><br />Well, they do!&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand how certain vendors demand FE for new buyers IF it is&nbsp; &quot;against the rules&quot;&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s not the case at all. Below is a post made by the Administrator, Flush, stating that FE is currently not against the rules. Flush does point out that this is likely to change into the future.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Silk Road discussion / Re: What is doing Sr abiut the PHD1 Situation?<br />« on: January 01, 2013, 05:21 AM »<br />He&#039;s been demoted for blatant scamming. Thanks to the new report feature we were able to stop him.&nbsp; Granted, I wish it could have been earlier, but we do out best. I agree with Nomad. Please don&#039;t FE with anyone. For the moment its still not against the rules, I bet one day that will change. Its best to get into the habit of not FE and 99 percent of buyers issues will&nbsp; go away...<br /><br /><br />~Flush&nbsp; &nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;Also, no vendor can demand that a buyer FE on an order. A simple solution would be to message a vendor prior to placing an order to clarify any issues you may have. Would save a buyer a lot of hassles as opposed to placing an order and then discovering the vendor wants you to FE for some reason, leading to delays in receiving anything.<br /><br />&nbsp;Flush also posted this comment (below) to clarify what&#039;s required of a new vendor before they can request a buyer to FE.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> What do you mean we dont do anything about FE? The rules are that a new vendor cannot ask anyone to FE unless they have 35 transactions and have vended for a month. If they violate that then it goes to 60 transactions and cant ask to FE for a couple months. We still let people chose what they want, but we have rules built in so that a vendor has to prove themselves first.<br /><br />~Flush&nbsp; &nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The removal of a vendor&#039;s ability to request a buyer to FE can&#039;t come soon enough IMO. They could still ask the question I suppose but at least if they did and were judged to be guilty,they would face the consequences of their actions.<br />

				The feedback system is flawed, somewhat.<br /><br />A very common feedback I see is &quot;Never arrived but got 50% refund. 5/5&quot;.<br /><br />This suggests to me there is a real problem. Feedback should be separated into a general score, and a YES/NO rating for whether the product arrived or not.

				Hello all, I was hoping to glean some advice from you astute seasoned SR&#039;ders.

I would like to ask what would be the best solution to the noob/no history or transactions when placing an order I think this vendor will request F/E, This vendor is the only one in my area with the product I&nbsp; &nbsp;require,&nbsp; That is a UK vendor as i don&#039;t want to start my first buy from abroad yet!!I have no choice but to&nbsp; EF. If he has set up fake feedback which I doubt ( if he has -he has a very wonderful imagination!) Is it possible the other UK vendors are invisible to me because of my noob status? As my choice is either FE or buy from abroad, and I don&#039;t want my pants pulled&nbsp; down on my&nbsp; first deal. Thanks in advance!

DID.<br /><br />Well u know how that story ended.<br />Other than that, its been nothing but awesome K holes, DMT, A little bit China, and good times.<br />I hope the good times last a good long time.

				Like you said it&#039;s a catch 22 innit? I had no option but to FE and he/they turned out to be a genuine, Hours of research paid off. but it&#039;s either buy loads of silly transactions with porn or what ever costs the least, Or just take the plunge. Remember some people on here are hardcore grafters knocking out Kellogs ( kilo&#039;s)&nbsp; and they aren&#039;t going to&nbsp; scam your for 1-2 btc. The way I see it is, It&#039;s only 1.65 for a decent bag of class A&#039;s or whatever floats your boat. If you do FE and he stings you, then&nbsp; you only lose a £10-$20 depending where you&#039;re from. And that&#039;s jack is it? But it&#039;s your/my&nbsp; fault if you/we&nbsp; trust him without research/forum/recommendation. Then you/we deserve it!! and then you can always&nbsp; just wait a week tops try and resolve. If not then you can moan or flame him.&nbsp; The vendor worth his salt like TopNotch,would already have good feedback. If you suspect it&#039;s fake ask on forum. I certainly had a good first buy/experience hope you do too buddy!! PM me if you want.Look around today. Some Newb got roasted for waiting an hour asking for a refund and&nbsp; taking the piss with this Vendor who has been here ten years, the Newb is finished on here now, all because he didn&#039;t read the vendor page or understand the commision of SR, and starts shouting his mouth off and on his first post ha!! I would say read the etiquette it&#039;s an insight and a half.

				You can see pretty much who to trust if you have any doubts don&#039;t buy from them or send a message and say I can&#039;t agree to FE but i&#039;ll Finalise as soon as it drops I will Finalise and aslong as you do it your gonna get trusted again its not rocket science its drug dealing but its civilised,,that is unless you have a spare kidney then gimme a shout,,lol,,no but seriously just IM the guys if they&#039;re straight up they wont mind coming to some agreement we&#039;re all here for the same reason really whether it be to sell or buy.Happy Halucinations,i&#039;m back to my bud.<br />Ta Ta<br />&nbsp;8)
