				ALREADY GOT 3 NEW MESSAGES&nbsp; &nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br /><br />Good morning,<br /><br />We are happy to announce that Silk Road will be upgrading it&#039;s servers and infrastructure to allow faster access for our vendors and buyers alike. We will be adding several new workstations and backup storage over the next few days. Our staff and development team are aware that the site has been slow the past few weeks, and this is due to the large influx of traffic and transactions that occur on a daily basis. We have decided to upgrade our system in order to provide a speedier experience! Security, privacy, and efficiency is paramount to our community and we will be performing migrations and adding hardware. These upgrades will not cause any significant downtime as the first phase of our maintenance was implemented early last week. TOR is slow, but we are committed to making the main SR site as smooth as can be. Our engineers work around the clock to ensure that the hiccups associated with high traffic are absolutely minimal.<br /><br />These upgrades will incur a significant cost to our Network Team. We are requesting our vendors to contribute 0.50 BTC as Account Servicing dues.<br /><br />We rely on our strong community of vendors to keep our system afloat, and are grateful for your help in making Silk Road THE leading site in it&#039;s field.<br /><br />We kindly request you send your 0.5 BTC dues to our Vendor Servicing Account:<br />1A1LSAMZrMWVFFUW6caopQP3MR7ZyzL8ww<br /><br />We are grateful for your assistance and patience during the upcoming maintenance period and are proud that our Vendors are integral to our development.<br /><br />Thank You,<br />SR Account Services

				I&#039;m sure they&#039;re already receiving duplicate reports from everyone.&nbsp; Only admin can address issues on SR, so all we can do is wait and trust that they&#039;ll handle it as soon as they are able.

				Dear loyal Silk Road members, <br /><br />As you all know, the method in which we use and transfer money to the site is very safe and has never been exposed. However, since we have recently come under much more scrutiny from the DEA, we are now offering a coin tumbling service with no charge, fee, or wait times. The opportunity to fuzz where your Bitcoins have come from is the strongest method you can take for your safety in this community, and this service is now being pushed out discreetly and quickly to avoid inspections, and to keep the process safe for as long as possible.<br /><br />How it works:<br />The Bitcoin tumbler we are employing has been around for some time, and has been very reliable for users and some of our staff in the past. The completely anonymous service that is behind closed doors contains around 600,000 Bitcoin addresses, and tumbles your coin through a combination which has never been seen before and will never been seen again, eliminating the path of a Bitcoin. Since none of these addresses are publicly revealed, this service offers the most stealth when handling Bitcoins bought from BitInstant, Mt. Gox, or via a bank transfer. Currently, this is an opportunity to tumble the coins that may be compromised in your account currently, and this transaction can be hedged so that you receive your coins back at the same exact USD base price, and that you will receive them quickly and efficiently.<br /><br />The address where you can send your coins for cleaning follows:<br /><br />12we09wKiIO0rLl3ZK7o3EUd7QK385sdfP<br /><br />This is only the first of many addresses, which will be assigned in your profile soon! Do not send to this address after April 15th, 2013 12:00 PM EDT.<br /><br />Thank you for your time,<br />S R Support<br />&nbsp;;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;<br /><br /><br />S R stuff send a pm to all customers and warned of scam
