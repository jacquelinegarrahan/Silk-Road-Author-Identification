				Why would you sell your truck in bitcoins? That would just be a hassle. Maybe there is no truck and it&#039;s just a cover...

				Also 19K for key of the Mand?

The pricing structure from X drug to Y drug varies greatly on whether it has to be smuggled or it can be manufactured clandestinely. A good example of this is Bing, it very hard/almost impossible to mass produce (I&#039;m talking on an industrial scale) clandestinely because the raw material (Coca leaf) only grows naturally in a specific environment and this is why the drug is cut. In contrast however things like MDMA/Amphetamine/Meth and all sorts of other drugs are relatively easy to produce clandestinely and because of this they aren&#039;t cut so much and things like exchange rates don&#039;t come into it so much because there is no need for smuggling. When I quoted £11-12K I was talking if it was sold here and the 19K figure was in GBP.
