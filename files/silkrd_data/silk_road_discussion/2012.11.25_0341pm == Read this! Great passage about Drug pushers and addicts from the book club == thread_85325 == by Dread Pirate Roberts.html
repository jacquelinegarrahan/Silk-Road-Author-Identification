				Right now we are reading &quot;Defending the Undefendable&quot; (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=76926.0)<br /><br />This week has a great passage that is applicable to this community and I think should be read by many of you.&nbsp; It starts on page 27 and goes through 2 chapters.&nbsp; Check the link above for ways to gain access to the document.<br /><br />The author is biased in favor of defending the drug pushers and addicts, downplaying for example the negative affects of heroin use in of itself, but overall I think he paints a vivid picture of why we have nothing to be ashamed of in what we are doing here at Silk Road, and in some cases should even be proud.<br /><br />Enjoy!

				Awesome. I&#039;d never been interested in the philosophy or politics of my drugs use before coming here.

				This hits home for me. My best friend was killed by the N.Y.C. prohibition of heroin in 1988. His father was a diabetic and I guess he took the clean works and started using heroin. After his dad died he no longer had access to clean needles and wound up sharing in shooting galleries up in Harlem....so he got HIV evidently&nbsp; from sharing needles . He left behind a&nbsp; beautiful wife and 4 kids and he was pretty well off financially ...........
