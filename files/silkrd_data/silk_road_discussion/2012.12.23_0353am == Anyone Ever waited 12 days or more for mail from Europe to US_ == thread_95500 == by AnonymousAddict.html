				I normally get my mail from Europe to West Coast US in anywhere from 4 to 8 days before Xmas - waiting on a pack from NL right now at 18 days but still not worried. Still, it&#039;s depressing to check my mail, discard all the Xmas cards and overlooking the Xmas gifts for the package of drugs I&#039;m waiting on... ;)
