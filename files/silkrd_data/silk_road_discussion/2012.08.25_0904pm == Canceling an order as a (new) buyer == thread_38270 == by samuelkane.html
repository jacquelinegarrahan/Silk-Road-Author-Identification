				I ordered a few products today (all still processing) and only after i ordered it i discovered the forumlink. Well hidden hehehe ;-) .<br />Anyways after reading some of the good vendor threads in the rumour mill, i got one product i wish to cancel.<br /><br />I got a few questions though:<br /><br />-How bad does this affect my rep as new buyer? will other better vendors now refuse my order?<br />-How do i go about doing this, do i message the vendor ASAP or do i wait for the cancellation option to appear in a few days?<br />-I read something about a cancelation fee, how much will this be ?<br /><br /><br />grtz,<br /><br />sam<br /><br /><br />

				Buyers think they should receiver there parcels next day that is nuts.There is a reason you see the page that says you have 17days till delivery so let it be starting a resolution at 8 days would be stupid and makes vendors mad thats why NEW MEMBERS are ignored because they are impatient and can&#039;t wait first thought is they were scammed alot of times it is the mail so wait till you have 2 days left to start a resolution 15 days is plenty of time for delivery

				That is totally not the case here, as explained in OP : <br />After reading vendor/product reviews in the rumour mill i have decided i am not interested in one of my orders anymore.<br />I&#039;m here asking my best course of action for all involved...<br /><br />Have yet to receive a clear informative reply from any vendor or buyer though<br />

				as long as the vendor hasnt processed ur order, if u PM him with transaction number he can cancel ur order from his end, this will not effect ur stats, but i do think u will loss 6% of the cost of ur order due to bitcoin handling/juggling costs...<br /><br />regards
