				Good advice!&nbsp; The reading is the key.&nbsp; If you do enough reading pretty soon the common sense kicks in and then the light bulb goes off.&nbsp; Holy shit this isn&#039;t that complicated.&nbsp; 42/42 all in escrow with only one refund that didn&#039;t even ding my stats!

				the first time i made a transaction i did my research and went with a vendor with a lot of reviews. paid a bit more for my goods but building that experience and building your own feedback is invaluable. my 2 cents

				I&#039;ve never gotten scammed, but i&#039;ve gotten some bunk shit, tryin to save cash and buying from cheaper listings by lesser known venders. If he&#039;s a known vender with great feedback, you&#039;ll usually get your money&#039;s worth.<br /><br />Almost got scammed by that faggot f16 recently, thank god/SR for Escrow.

				I got scammed on my first order; back before I figured out the long and arduous process of getting BTC onto SR I bought a &quot;Western Union to BTC&quot; service from a vendor who must have somehow faked a whole bunch of feedback because he had a decent amount of positive feedback.&nbsp; I sent $200 to him via Western Union and then never heard anything from him.&nbsp; I learned two things after that; learn how to get your own fucking BTC, and always do research on a vendor before ordering anything.<br /><br />The advice above would have come in handy but I was such a newb I wasn&#039;t even reading the forums that much back then and probably wouldn&#039;t have seen it.<br /><br />So it goes.

				I did more research for my first 1gr of weed order, than some people do for 1000$ MP to BTC. <br />I cannot understand how the hell they do that. <br />Especially if we re talking about US since you guys have it very easy, 1 month ago you could deposit to bit instant anonymously I think. A million times easier than buying coins in my country, and still the moneypaks were sold without even a forum check. <br />But I can relate to people getting scammed from trusted vendors who decide to leave with some extra money, you never know when that&#039;s gonna happen.

				I would suggest that your little list of rules get edited and stickied, but it wouldn&#039;t matter. There are SO many guides and resources here explaining everything yet most new people are ADAMANT about totally bypassing them, asking questions that have been answered a thousand times, and then whining not only when they get scammed, but for every fucking thing. I just saw a thread from a noob threatening to put his vendor on blast cause his order hasn&#039;t arrived in a week. I wanted to rip off his dumb head and shit down his throat. PEOPLE LIKE YOU PUT THIS GLORIOUS PLACE AT RISK<br /><br />oh. uhm.<br /><br />I don&#039;t automatically shit on any newbie saying they&#039;ve been scammed, though. Everyone, no matter how long they&#039;ve been here, should get the chance to share their side of the story without being written off.

				Single easiest way to not get scammed, don&#039;t FE.&nbsp; Seems every I got scammed thread starts off with yeah I FEed, I typically stop reading at this point.&nbsp;

				I just got my first order.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t get scammed.&nbsp; I spent the time to read the reviews, find a vendor who doesn&#039;t require FE and<br />has what I want at a reasonable price.&nbsp; Not too low or high.<br /><br />Things worked out for me.&nbsp; If other newb&#039;s follow some simple logic then things can work out for them too.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				I got scammed on my first order. And like my fifth one.<br /><br />1st: BTCBuddy scammed me on an 800$ MP<br />~5th: MissIt scammed me on a 1300$ MP<br /><br />Both had &gt;98 ratings when I ordered, and had great reps on the forums.<br /><br /><br />Moral of the story: GreenDot is evil
