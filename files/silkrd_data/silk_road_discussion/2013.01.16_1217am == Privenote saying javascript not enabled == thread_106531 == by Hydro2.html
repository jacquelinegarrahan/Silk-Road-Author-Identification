				Privnote requires Javascript to be enabled in order for it to work. As&nbsp; Twelve_Pickles wrote, take the time to learn PGP. It&#039;s not so hard after a little practice and it&#039;s by far the safest way to protect your info when sending it to a vendor. Also, be aware that the Privnote you send will be stored on a 3rd party server in PLAIN TEXT, where it has the potential to be seen by prying eyes with a warrant.

NoScript is configured to allow JavaScript by default in the Tor Browser Bundle, which has always been the case. You must have turned it off at some stage because it&#039;s definitely enabled by default. You do know you require a min. of 100 posts to give or receive karma?

				I know my TOR&#039;s noscript changed behavior lately. It used to allow all by default as you say, and I left it that way as that&#039;s what TOR&#039;s developers recommend. I am farmiliar with the functionality of noscript as I&#039;ve used it in regular firefox for years.&nbsp; It has changed in TOR, for me at least, within the past couple of weeks to no longer allow all by default. <br /><br />the +1 I didn&#039;t mean to imply giving karma, I meant that I agree with the &quot;use pgp&quot; recommendation.

				If that&#039;s the case, just click on the &quot;NoScript&quot; button and change what&#039;s required.

				Privnote isn&#039;t advisable, however, if you trust their explanation of how it works then it is sound, nothing is stored in plain text and even they cannot read messages.<br />Of course you&#039;re putting your trust in them not using additional code...<br /><br />If their source was released it would be very nice as you could run it yourself.
