				I hear tale it was started by DPR as a place to sell his shrooms. All posts go back to 2/2011. I think there might actually be a history of silk road thread somewhere. <br /><br />

Before DPR was DPR, (s)he had a humble darknet site where he plied his trade. His alias on that first site was Silk Road. Eventually (assuming it&#039;s been the same person throughout), he stepped up big time and started this site, calling it The Silk Road.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only been here about a month, but that&#039;s the picture of the history of SR that I&#039;ve been able to scrape together.
