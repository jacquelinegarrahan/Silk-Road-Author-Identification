				When the whole Tony fiasco happened Opi was one of the names that came up as he was selling the exact same pebbles, something we&#039;d not seen anyone else sell here.. Plus he&#039;s from the same country<br /><br />However, do you have any more evidence than that? Has anything new come to light. At the moment this just seems like an accusation, can you provide us with a bit more info?

				I don&#039;t think it matters whether OPI is tony76 or not.&nbsp; Regardless, it&#039;s going to end badly because: 1) He&#039;s selling heroin, and 2) He&#039;s requiring FE.&nbsp; It&#039;s a recipe for disaster.

				I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s the same person but I do think that all these Canadian vendors that are all selling the same products at different times are a group of friends who know each other.

				I refuse to order from Canadian vendors due to the whole Tony fiasco.&nbsp; I&#039;m almost positive Tony plans to pop on here again under a new name and scam everyone again, if he isn&#039;t already trying to do so.&nbsp; Sorry to all REAL Canadian vendors who are actually doing a legit job.&nbsp; It&#039;s just my feelings on it all.

There is a lot of dealers there because they are a lot of junkies too. I&#039;m sure a couple of dealers there know about SR and maybe they want to pull up a scam like tony76 has do, or maybe it&#039;s just the same person it&#039;s hard to know because of anonymity.. Be cautious with sellers asking to FE, i don&#039;t say they are all scammers but a seller with a short selling history that ask people to FE is an alarm sign.

				the problem is that there is a lot of new members and they feel like they have no choice but to FE.&nbsp; and then there is the junkies who for some reason can&#039;t seem to help it.&nbsp; not hating on junkies but it seems to be the case.

				there&#039;s some good sellers in canada...its a big country; can&#039;t assume that they&#039;re all the same.&nbsp; 3Jane has been totally legit so far.&nbsp; Anarcho has been around forever, but it does make me uncomfortable that he requests FE (sorry dude).<br /><br />there are others.&nbsp; lots of drugs in canada, and some really nice people too.&nbsp; personally, I just wouldn&#039;t order from anyone who requests FE or anyone who sells heroin, period.&nbsp; there&#039;s some seriously bad ju-ju hovering around that drug and the people who sell it.

				Hey, I&#039;m not sure why nobody&#039;s noticed but OPI not only sells the same product such as pebbles but, he has almost word for word the same description of them as Tony76 had for his. OPI even warns any new heroine users against ordering in pretty much the exact same way as how it was stated in Tony76&#039;s description of the pebbles. <br />I don&#039;t even use heroin but just happened to read both listings, Tony&#039;s when it was up and just recently saw OPI&#039;s.<br />I would have been skeptical or not care but that is just too much of a red flag. <br />

				Why does everybody keep acting like &quot;Tony&quot; was just some guy.&nbsp; If i were ceo of &quot;Tony&quot; having walked away with basically money from almost everybody here and could get back in line and start &quot;Fred&quot; and sell the same shit with no repercussions ........sign me up. Is it Tony&#039;s&quot; fault that you GAVE him money before even seeing your drugs? Would you do it on the street? If you have then you prolly watched your money disappear around the corner and end up getting stuck in some strippers garter belt. I have no doubt whoever was involved in all that is back. Still makin money and laughing. Thats the world of drugs. Learn from your lesson and move on...........DON&#039;T FE EVER!!!!&nbsp; Drug addicts want their drugs and push caution to the wind and that will NEVER change.

If they have a high one in proportion to their sales and how much they spent then nah.

				yes FE is a risky thing to do but if you are new, you have no choice really....unless you find a brand new vendor and they have to sell in escrow, but they can refuse to sell to you, so its one of those catch 22 things. I was buzzing to get my first escrow order but it was only a 25% refund if anything happened anyway as was international, so was not that great a safety belt anyway....<br />I would be wary of anyone who requires FE off everybody though.<br /><br />Oh and a lot of vendors are asking it in cases of under 10 transactions now.

				is it any wonder that people scam SR buyers, some of them appear dumb as fuck.<br /><br />if your package did not arrive it was either not sent or it was intercepted, if it was intercepted then that is the buyers responsibility for poor or indiscreet packaging. either way giving 5/5 feedback is as dumb as finalizing early.

Really, it is actually very hard to get scammed on SR if you can be bothered to research your vendors properly. I do think that a minimum of 10 buys is quite steep but if you are selling bulk like say SKYY does or something like that I can understand it. I personally have a 5+ policy but for larger amounts I&#039;ll ask for FE. Like Anarcho said having this policy does make a fuck of a lot of difference to us because if we do get someone trying to rip us off it&#039;s not like we can wander into court and get you done for fraud then sue you for trying to mug us off. That shit don&#039;t fly when ya shottin magic powders I&#039;m afraid, in fact if we did we&#039;d get clapped in irons as soon as the the judge read the papers. So when the ordinary doesn&#039;t work what do you do? Well we can&#039;t catch a flight to the X-destination to go collect by pointing a strap at your head (and believe me if I had the time and money to go and shoot scammers in the knees I would) so we make policies that limit the risk of people trying to mug us off. I&#039;m not fucking tolerating up to 10% of my orders going tits-vertical. That&#039;s a chunk of fucking change OUT of my back-burner that&#039;s rightful place is IN my back-burner.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you should have a right to bitch when you can quite easily find vendors you can be almost certain wont scam you, I have only ever had one transaction be a fuck up but that was because the vendor never sent it and just disappeared, not through an attempted scam. Just do your homework and you wont get fucked. Also the SR ratings system and resolution center works in the favor of the buyers anyway, what more do you want?

They start out good with great communication and that changes awfully fast. ( not always )<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I suspect a few things are going on. One is that as they get good stats they start getting a lot more business and as a result spend a lot more time dealing with things like packing, shipping, resupplying, etc.&nbsp; That means they have less time to communicate with buyers.&nbsp; This can be annoying but if they are still getting the product out efficiently that shouldn&#039;t be any big deal.&nbsp; But sometimes things start falling apart as the seller finds himself unable to cope with the volume.&nbsp; Another, sadly, is that some vendors wind up getting high on their own supply and melting down.&nbsp; When you suddenly have access to essentially unlimited quantities of your drug of choice, it&#039;s easy to wind up binging and before you know it you&#039;ve just injected last week&#039;s orders.&nbsp;

				I think that&#039;s what FannyHill Did... Used all his/her product.... instead of sending it out.... w007 promised me express shipping delivered two weeks ago this coming Wednesday. Has not said a word to me since item went to &quot;In Transit&quot; Domestic mail only takes 5 days max. <br /><br />&nbsp;Had no problem communicating when he wanted my money.... once I placed the order all PM&#039;s ignored. Lucky I refused to FE..

Sorry to say, but it&#039;s beginning to look like a trend.
