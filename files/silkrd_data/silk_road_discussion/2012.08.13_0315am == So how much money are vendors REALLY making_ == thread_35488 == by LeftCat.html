				So I read that Forbes article:<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;the site’s number of sellers, who offer everything from cocaine to ecstasy, has jumped from around 300 in February to more than 550. Its total sales now add up to around $1.9 million a month. And its operators generate more than $6,000 a day in commissions for themselves, compared with around $2,500 in February.&quot;<br /><br />Now, the media tends to exaggerate the fuck out of things.<br />I guess I&#039;m asking in a general sense, how much do sellers usually make in an average week?

				That&#039;s far too general of a question to get any kind of useful answer.&nbsp; It would obviously depend on what they were selling, how often they were able to restock, how much time and effort they were willing to put into messaging, packing and shipping,&nbsp; their pricing/quality compared to other vendors, whether they shipped internationally, and a ton of other factors.

				None of your fucking business OP and I&#039;m not sure why you think it&#039;s appropriate to pry into others financials when in any other situation it&#039;s extremely ignorant to ask. Jesus Christ I don&#039;t know why people think that just because you are doing something illegal means that automatically means etiquette goes out the window. Would you like it if some stranger off the street came up to you and asked what you earned? No. You&#039;d think it&#039;s an invasion of your privacy and you&#039;d quite rightly tell them to fuck off. <br /><br />Yano how people run their own business here, yano selling their wares? Well it&#039;s THEIR business, not yours. So STFU.

				Although not a seller myself, I think that this question is far too general for anybody to be able to answer. It depends on SO many different things; packaging costs, shipping costs, living expenses, profits made, etc. Also, this question is fairly similar to asking somebody on the street how much they earn in a week - I bet most people will tell you that you&#039;re too nosy. I&#039;ve always grown up with others around me telling me that it&#039;s rude to ask people questions related to their finances. But, that&#039;s just me.

				In my part of the World, it is considered rude and insulting to speculate on a persons income or to ask them directly how much they earn.<br />I guess that is old etiquette, but I agree with it. It is intrusive to ask and an answer best kept between the vendor and the wall.<br /><br />Some people wouldn&#039;t be dropping exact figures, but love to mention extravagant purchases and large figures that they spend on here, but that is entirely down to themselves to disclose that info, but may be an attempt, on their part, to let it be known that they have a lot of money.

The point of my post was that the OP had the numbers there to answer his own question yet failed to even use a calculator and a bit of common sense.

				Here&#039;s the actual academic paper the Forbes article is referring to: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.7139v1.pdf<br />By reproducing their methods, you can easily estimate how much vendors are making, simply by looking at their feedback pages. <br />Surely no one is making as much as the site admins.

				First off, it&#039;s none of your business, second, it varies from vendor to vendor, third, knowing this doesn&#039;t affect you in any way so it doesn&#039;t matter, and lastly, this is way too general of a question to get a specific answer. Some new vendors who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing could be losing money, while top vendors could be making thousands a week. There are hundreds of vendors in between those two examples as well.
