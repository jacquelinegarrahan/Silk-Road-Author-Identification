				I recently purchased an item that was not as strong as advertised..I would say about 1/3 the strength. The funds are still in escrow. If he does not agree to a partial refund, would SR do anything about it or would they tell me to release escrow because I did indeed receive it.

				I&#039;m guessing you would probably have to release it..otherwise everybody would be like<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;I ordered [drug] and it was weaker/less potent/cut then it should have been!&quot;<br /><br />esp. when it comes to things like coke...

				leave low feedback. thats what the feedback system is for, but try to contact the vendor before leaving neg. feedback to see if there&#039;s a way to resolve the issue.

				Message the vendor and see if they will do anything for you like giving some money back or sending a new batch at a discount. If not, you can go to resolution and see if SR will give you any money back. A partial refund might be fair.

				release funds, because you got your shipment and the transaction is complete.<br /><br />But leave a 3/5 or so becuase the product was far inferior to what was described.&nbsp; &nbsp;And just don&#039;t do business with that individual again.

				couldn&#039;t agree more anarcho, that&#039;s what the rating system is for, i however made the mistake of making a purchase via forums, the seller seems legit but have no recourse and its been like ten days and still waiting, it hurts when i hit my&nbsp; head against the wall for being gullible, still maybe today it will arrive? who knows, all i know is i now have 0 balance and 0 Valium. Ain&#039;t&nbsp; life a bitch!

				Yeah, I would 100% stay away from doing deals over the forums.&nbsp; Even with OOE sales over on SR (which I do about 70% of my business with), it&#039;s still important to have a listing associated so that buyers and sellers can track shipping and leave feedback.&nbsp; I would suggest that if you haven&#039;t received or heard from the seller in a few days (was it a domestic shipment?) I would put up a post about it in the scam sellers stickey&#039;d thread in the Rumor Mill section of the forums.&nbsp; That&#039;s a touch knock to take, and I hope it comes through for you, but it&#039;s awfully tempting for a seller to just forego shipping since you can&#039;t touch their feedback or have any form of resolution.&nbsp; Have to stay safe!
