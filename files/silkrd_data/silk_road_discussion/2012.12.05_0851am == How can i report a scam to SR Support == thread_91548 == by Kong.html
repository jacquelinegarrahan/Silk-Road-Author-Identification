				I wouldn&#039;t worry if it has only been a week. Contact the vendor after 10 days, and go to resolution the day before auto-finalization.

				Chill the fuck out. Sometimes can take up to 14 days.<br />I find it funny how the orders for impatient little sluts take longer than the orders for normal patient people.<br /><br />Karma, biatchhhhh!<br />

				A week as in 5 actual shipping days? That&#039;s nothing to get too excited about. Seriously.<br /><br />SR support won&#039;t do anything for you yet until the resolve link goes active. If you were to send SR support a message (link at bottom of SR page), they would tell you to wait as there is nothing they can do for you until the resolve link goes live.&nbsp; <br /><br />The one thing about SR that you should know - always plan ahead. Don&#039;t order 3 days before a weekend and expect to get by the weekend. Some vendors are that good but some vendors also mark as shipped 1 or 2 before it&#039;s actually put into the mail system.

				Relax, read, be patient, gain experience before posting too much.&nbsp; All of these things will help you spark up good relationships on here and gain knowledge.&nbsp; When you&#039;re new and spout off harshly i can easily come across the wrong way and get a very negative response from others.&nbsp; Including vendors.&nbsp; Give it a try, it&#039;s worked for me.&nbsp; Never lost a coin on this site.&nbsp; Had to go to resolution once and i was impatient (to myself), but in the end it all worked out and i got my coins back.&nbsp; I just had a package go missing for a week.&nbsp; The vendor gave me the tracking info and it was never updated after it got to my local post office.&nbsp; I called them and they couldn&#039;t tell me anything.&nbsp; Finally a week later the postman handed it to me, told me he had stuck it in another lock box so he didn&#039;t take it back to the post office, he then took a few days off around Thanksgiving&nbsp; and no one else on this planet knew where my package was but him.&nbsp; He handed it to me and apologized.&nbsp; Thank god i&nbsp; didn&#039;t light the vendor up with a harsh reaction.&nbsp; We would have blackballed each other and i would have bashed him on this forum and he would have done the same on the vendor forum and we would both look like shit over a perfectly executed transaction on his end and mine.&nbsp; Think it through and be patient.&nbsp; It&#039;s to your benefit.

				Hey all,<br />I just received a package from a well known vendor who I have brought from before and has been quality product, what I received today was 100% bunk which doesn&#039;t burn and taste like its just pure rock salt. I&#039;m not to sure what I can do but too send people salt... I don&#039;t understand why they even bothered sending it at all?<br />Is there a way to contact anyone because it looks like its happened to a few people,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its an Outrage.<br />Anyways should I create a new thread letting others know about this?<br />Peace

You know what they say about people that think they are being scammed...&nbsp;

Im not very hopeful of getting any real stuff though..if I do I&#039;ll return with a new review.<br />only ordered from that vendor once before, and had to ask for a reship twice before I finally got something (then severely underweight, it was real stuff then though,many months ago)
