				This topic is here to serve and teach the SR community what can go wrong when ordering things online. <br /><br />What I would like people to post here is there stories. Of what you ordered, what happened, (did police come knocking at your door? did you get a letter from customs? did your vendor send you something &quot;odd&quot;?), WHY you think it happened(do you think your vendor got busted?,did your vendor do a terrible job packaging and the post office intercepted it? , and what you learned from the experience. <br /><br />In this game mistakes get made. Vendors get busted and have buyers addresses at the scene (even though their not suppose to), the post office intercepts letters, SHIT HAPPENS. People, POST your stories. This will HELP other people from making the same mistakes that led you to trouble.<br /><br />-SBmafia

				I won&#039;t antagonize, but my security-spidey sense says something&#039;s a bad idea about this thread. <br /><br />anyway, several similar posts like this have been made in the past - just use the search function. also, this is probably more a topic for security rather than the commerce section.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95761.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94990.0<br />

				I had a very large package delivered one morning...<br /><br />And I thought nothing of it, nothing was every intercepted, only had one customs letter for some weed and so I sat the package next to my laptop and was emailing the guy who had sent it to me to me, to tell him it had arrived. <br /><br />When I hear a car and look out my window.. it was the police.<br /><br />My first though, &quot;OH SHIT! OH SHIT! OH SHIT!&quot; <br /><br />I quickly grabbed a marker and wrote the words &quot;return to sender&quot; and then waited for them to burst through the door...<br /><br />They never burst through the door, they rang the bell.. <br /><br />I answered.. They asked to come in.. I let them in.<br /><br />I asked them if they would like tea, or coffee - they both said tea.<br /><br />So I proceeded to make them tea and ask them what they were visiting for...<br /><br />While they made their way in to the room with the package - at this point I think I was on at least my 3rd heart attack since I had seen the car? Possibly 4th.<br /><br />And then they said, while both giving the package a funny look (It&#039;s about X, I believe you witnessed they assault that happened to take place on Thursday night) <br /><br />X is a friend, obviously not going to use his real name. <br /><br />I was so fucking relieved at this point, I told them everything they needed to know and they were on their way. <br /><br />If that wasn&#039;t the happiest day of my life, I don&#039;t know what is. <br /><br /><br />This isn&#039;t the best of stories, fairly shitty actually - but I felt sorry for no one replying to you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(P.S None of that story was true, but it was kinda&#039; fun to write&nbsp; 8) )

My partner is shitting brick as the cops pull all around me, him and my truck and trailer. I know my rights and I have been raided before so I stay calm as not to alert them to the couple K&#039;s my partner is holding in his hands in a small box. 1 of the cars has a drug dog in it, the dog starts barking but I&#039;m not too worried about poochy.<br />The cops get out and look at my trailer while walking up, I quickly walk up to them and ask if they need anything. They say &quot;yes, we got a call about a noise complaint coming from your house&quot; at this point I die laughing inside as my partner, still standing in the same damn place looking like a sad little dog is peeing his pants. I tell them no, it wasn&#039;t me but the neighbors across the street, who they had problems with in the past. I ask them if they normally come this heavily equipped for a noise complaint and they said they tell me it&#039;s because of the same guy across the street who they dragged out of there a week prior for beating up with girlfriend with a baseball bat. Stand up chap<br />Needless to say when they left I threw the rest of what I had in the trailer and got the fuck out of there quick.<br />

				I had a virtual office rented out, and was getting stuff sent there no problem for a while. I knew my stuff was there one day as it was sent tracked, but there was no email to say I had post.....<br />So I sat it out for a few days and I got an email from the owner of the place saying he forwarded the packaged to the police and had cancelled my account. <br />We rented the place with a fake name and the address of a nearby student accommodation house. There was 1000 strong dutch XTC pills in the envelope, so I am not sure but I am guessing, the police kicked in the door of this address and hopefully found three students smoking weed, who would have been ideal suspects for such an operation, in the eyes of these middle to elderly policemen. I never heard a thing after this. <br /><br />We found out where the owner of the rented offices lived and we petrol bombed his two cars for being an asshole. I wonder how well the police helped him wit that. That&#039;ll teach him to go opening post that ain&#039;t his in future.

				I was getting weight delivered to a abandoned house for awhile, moving tons of drugs in and out of that place. well guess what turns out one day the realtors decided to sell it without giving me a warning. The next time i went to the house all my drugs where gone, it was about 100k worth. Cops where scoping the place out and quickly approach me to ask me why I was inside the house, i quickly made up an excuse saying that i was about to take pictures of the house for my &quot;photography class&quot;, they didnt buy it and i was sent to jail where i spent 2 years where i was brutally gang raped and used as a sex doll for every inmate, until i broke out. now im out anc on the run, telling my story on the internet.&nbsp; ;)

				Cooking breakfast in an upstairs duplex. Hear the dreaded cop knock and doorbell ring. Run and look out the front window and there&#039;s 3 total unmarked brand new SUVs with at least 8 guys in full riot gear all surrounding my door. At the time I just had lots of cash but still enough weed to get me a felony. So I grab the money and bud and run to my balcony to throw it it my neighbors who I knew thinking I&#039;ll grab it after all this. As I look out the back theres another 4-6 SWAT guys all looking and point in my direction. Mind you the knocking is continuing this whole time, and my wife was in some shock mode where she just kept cooking and was acting like nothing was happening. I hid everything in my best spot and finally answered the door. My hands were shaking so bad and my pupils were probably massive from all the adrenaline. <br />Turns out they were looking for some super tatted up thug that drove a car similar to mine that I had sold weeks before. For some reason I even asked in they wanted to come in and they declined, idk wtf I was thinking. Still to this day I don&#039;t understand why I offered them into my home and why they would decline if looking for a fugitive and I spent like 5 minutes letting them pound and ring. <br />After I shut the door they proceeded to have a snowball fight for about 10 minutes and then drive off caravan style. It was a weird day. Cleaned house for a while after that.
