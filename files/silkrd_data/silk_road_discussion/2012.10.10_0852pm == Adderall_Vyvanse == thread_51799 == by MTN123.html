				been a buyer here for quite some time, and browsing i saw the prices for 50mg vyvanse is 20-30 USD....i thought that was absurd. my question is, is there really that big of a demand for D-Amphetamines as I could easily find bulk for domestic (USA).

				I don;t have any idea why it is so expensive on here.&nbsp; I take an ADD med daily and at those prices I ha\ve to hunt around for deals 700-900 a month is insane!!!&nbsp; That is almost as much as my mortgage.&nbsp; :P

				well its demand, yes, but supply is the biggest issue i think.&nbsp; There is just not enough product available, so the people that desperately want it&nbsp; will pay the huge price. They&#039;re getting gouged.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even bother checking the listings for stimulants anymore, it&#039;s a waste of time.

				I asked this same question probably less than a week ago. I can&#039;t believe what people are asking for them. Just recently I fronted a big meth dealer $200 to get started back up after a recent raid. Anyways 3 day&#039;s later he gave me 60x20mg adderalls my initial $200 and a gram of meth. Basically my point is that around here adderall and the sort go for next to nothing. I on a daily basis snort 100mg of adderall which would be one expensive habit at SR prices. I think prescription opiate prices are insane as well but I see that locally as well.

				I second the supply/demand hypothesis. There isn&#039;t any competition between vendors on price because buyers are gobbling them up at the insane prices. No reason to drop the price if you&#039;re able to move your supply swiftly enough.<br /><br />I also remember reading on here that while adderall is super-common in the US, it&#039;s not as common in Europe, so European buyers are paying a premium for a product that they can&#039;t easily get domestically. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s true, but it sounds plausible.<br /><br />If you&#039;re able to get bulk, get a vendor account ASAP. You&#039;ll make a lot of money, and maybe for once I can buy some straight d-Amph without feeling like I have to file a police report for sexual assault.<br /><br />BoyMaster and CapeCrusader both have very high quality (90%) amphetamine for sale at reasonable prices. It&#039;s not adderall, but if you&#039;re willing to dip your toes into some good ol&#039; racemic amphetamine, it&#039;ll keep you productive and awake for as long as you need. $40/gram is super-reasonable, especially considering that adderall is going for like $500 a gram these days.

				40 dollars for a gram of speed is reasonable?? wow&nbsp; ???<br />I think that&#039;s insane. Or maybe I always got ultra crap for 5 euros (about 6-7 dollars) out here but I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s not the case.<br /><br />I wish adderall would not be so fucking expensive. I&#039;ve been searching for it for years now and now I&#039;ve found it it&#039;s way too overpriced :(<br />Might be better to just search for d-amph on here...<br /><br /><br />
