				Damn this is the second time I&#039;ve read someone getting into someone elses account.&nbsp; Another guy posted a day or two ago but he was on the opposite side.&nbsp; He was the one who tried logging into his own account and then somehow got logged into the account of another member.&nbsp; He was a stand up guy about it though and just logged out and didn&#039;t mess around with anything.&nbsp; What a low life piece of chit to do that to you man.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry to hear that happened and hope that there is a resolution to this serious problem.&nbsp; I will no longer be holding bitcoins in SR because of this.&nbsp; Anything I don&#039;t spend goes right back into an external wallet.&nbsp; I used to keep coins laying around in SR but it appears that&#039;s asking for trouble now.&nbsp;

				And how did he steal your coins without a pin? you even need your pin to order.<br /><br /><br /><br />My bet is you&#039;re registered on Atlantis, and used the same details to signup over there...<br /><br />

				Atlantis is run by some shady organization. I think that one day soon Atlantis will be gone and that they will take alot of nubs coin with them. If you sign up for atlantis and use your SR name its very likely that the site admins will steal your money on SR if they figure out you have the same name and pass on SR. Atlantis is clearly run by criminals that are trying to steal alot of money. They are clearly in some shady country because they advertise using legitimate advertising and they are a criminal outfit. They could only get away with that if they were in a country that didnt care. <br /><br />Atlantis sucks anyway. I would bet $10,000 that Atlantis did the DDOS on SR and that the longer Atlantis goes the higher the risk of attack will be for SR. As Atlantis controllers will probably spend some of thier profit to attack SR again. Atlantis is not SRs biggest competition but it is SRs biggest threat because they are activly trying to fuck up the site in anyway they can.<br /><br />FUCK ATLANTIS.

				Its almost certain that you tried to register on a phishing site with the same credentials you use for SR. Change your login info and be more careful which websites you trust with that info. Never re-use passwords, especially for sensitive accounts or accounts which have access to your money.

				I was reading a thread yesterday where the guys account was hijacked mid thread and his login details posted.&nbsp; The hijacker claimed that he worked it out on SR with a bit of trial and error.&nbsp; As the dude had used the same name here as over on SR and had made the password easy enough to guess..&nbsp; along with the pin, he just broke into the account here to tell people it&#039;s not always phishing, sometimes it&#039;s just a lack of awareness of security.<br /><br />pro tip..&nbsp; the pin on SR doesn&#039;t mean only 4 letters. it should actually say passphrase as that&#039;s what you should be using.&nbsp; in the dudes case, he took the pin literally and made it a 4 digit number.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve done that then you should seriously consider making it into a proper passphrase.<br /><br />just a thought.<br />

				A 4 digit pin should be kind of safe if you only get 6 trials... I don&#039;t think the hijacker got that lucky and actually guessed a 4 digit number in under 6 trials. Maybe he managed to steal the hashes or got it through social engineering somehow.

				Ii just read on the SR Reddit page about another person getting randomly logged into another SR users account.<br /><br />Could it be anything to do with this<br /><br />&quot;So this just happened to me, and it&#039;s kind of off putting. I opened my tor browser, loaded smoothly, but when it opened it told me &quot;Sorry, you are not using Tor.&quot; This has never happened to me before, and this probably wasn&#039;t a good idea, but I go to my bookmarks, and click the SR Psychedelics bookmark. This usually takes me to the login page, but instead, I&#039;m told I&#039;m logged in as another user. Good thing a pin is required, because I&#039;d have free reign over their bitcoin. Any explanation for this?&quot;<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1dy6xf/comprehensive_guide_to_safely_browse_the_silkroad/

				I got hit too.&nbsp; I was fortunate enough to not lose any btc before I figured it out and changed my password.&nbsp; Make sure you have different passwords for EVERYTHING.&nbsp; NEVER use the same one for more than one account.&nbsp; That&#039;s how they get easy access.
