				what proof do you want? he took my moneypack number with the assurance the coins would be in my account within the hour, that was 24 hours ago, all listings are down, not returning any messages at all, even though they have been read, doesn&#039;t take rocket scientist to figure this one out. that&#039;s all the info this requires, I reported him/her/them to SR Admin as well. call me a troll I dont give a shit. just trying to save others from getting scammed.

				You should probably check to see if the MP has already been redeemed as well.

				yes i checked and it was redeemed. i have a toss phone from another state i used&nbsp; with a fake i.d. to contact moneypak and report the card lost.&nbsp; i will ever see the money again, toss phone&#039;s been destroyed, but at least now this gives the thieves a little something to worry about. i want to point out i never purchase my own money paks so no worries of camera shots from the store, my friend who is in theatre loves to do this for a small fee with a different look each time. thanks everyone and so long wont be back for awhile this place is getting too crazy hope it doesn&#039;t self destruct, which may be exactly what leo is planning on since they live on these pages.

				yes he is a scammer, i have alerted mods and he has pulled down all his listings... he ripped me for 200.00 bux 2 days ago and has gotten several others as well.&nbsp; mods said they will investigate into and ban him but he&#039;s already gone and probably on another throw away account laughing at me. Pretty sure they arewnt gunna refund us anything being that MP to bitcoin exchange is not covered escrow,.... im pretty fucking salty too. sux when you cant trust someone with 100% feedback.
