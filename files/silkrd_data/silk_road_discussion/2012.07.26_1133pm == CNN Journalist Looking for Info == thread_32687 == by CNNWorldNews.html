				Hello Silk Road Community!<br /><br />I am currently working on story about Silk Road, which will air next Thursday 8/2/12. I would like to get input from both buyers and sellers. Sellers, are you making more money than you did on the streets? How many packages do you mail per week? Are you concerned about security or getting busted by LE? Buyers, do you still seek drugs from real life dealers? Do you prefer online over face to face? What&#039;s the most amount of packages you&#039;ve gotten in a week? <br /><br />I really appreciate everyone&#039;s input. Personally, I think Silk Road is a great idea and the story will shed some positive light on the market and focus on the failed &quot;war on drugs&quot;. <br /><br />Thank You<br /><br />

				Vendor here! Please promptly go fuck yourself and leave us alone, we do not enjoy this extra attention, no matter how much extra business it might bring both myself and fellow vendors, we service our community and keep people safe, now I&#039;d ask if you have ever tried to purchase coke on the streets, but being as you work at CNN you most likely get it at work, but for those who actually have to go to a coke dealer to buy, it can be VERY dangerous, the only danger anybody will ever encounter on this site is the government; other then that it completely removes the violence out of a very violent business. Not only does it remove all violence, but it keeps people safe, almost all of the products being sold on here (I said almost) are very pure and actually are what the vendor says they are, in the streets if you go to try to buy any drug, you dont know what your ACTUALLY getting, if your getting anything at all (vs being held up when you arrive to the deal location) it could contain very dangerous adulterants that local dealers might not know are actually dangerous.<br /><br />As far as how many packages per week for buyers/sellers or anything such as how much were making/spending, you will not get any answers, this is to protect us from LE, which you could be yourself.<br /><br />If you are who you say you are, show the true side of Silk Road, dont say that it lets kids buy drugs, because seriously, what teenager cant? In high school I had more connections from just going to school then I knew what to do with, kids can get drugs without having to use the internet just fine. Speaking about everybody now, regardless of age, there are always dangers of buying drugs, be in physical dangers, or potentially drugs not being what their advertised as, Silk Road makes sure that you get what you want and in a very safe manor, as well as having a community of very friendly (for the most part) and helpful people that will help you to make sure your using it right and not doing to much, or not doing anything stupid while on the drug. Also dont mention the Armory, that&#039;s like Silk Road&#039;s adopted autistic child who we found in a garbage can one day but decided to keep around because were nice people.

				LOL I can&#039;t believe some people still think that Silk Road is real. I hate to break it to you, but no one actually sells drugs over the internet. Look what happened to The Farmer&#039;s Market. Silk Road is a SCAM/TROLL SITE. Only a few users actually receive drugs, and when they do, the authorities are promptly notified for the lulz. The rest of their &quot;customers&quot; get nothing except their bitcoins held in permanent escrow, i.e. stolen. It&#039;s like those fake internet pharmacies that never send you anything and then use your username to post rave reviews to their shopping cart system and forums.

				Hey asshole journalist: why do I have a feeling you&#039;re either LE or are going to do a hit-piece on SR? Any mention of SR on CNN won&#039;t lead to anything good for SR. Instead, why don&#039;t you do a report on how shitty the war on drugs has been on people&#039;s lives? Why don&#039;t you point out how cruel this society is to drug /users/ (*NOT* abusers)? Someone&#039;s life is ruined every 19 seconds[1], not by drugs, but by LE and the unjust laws. Why don&#039;t you talk about how many people have lost their lives thanks to the war on drugs, both in America and abroad? Why don&#039;t you talk about the success of decriminalization in Portugal? Why don&#039;t you point out contradictions like cigarettes being a bigger public health concern than heroin, yet are legal [2]? Or point out the studies showing that many illegal drugs, including marijuana, ecstasy (MDMA), LSD, and mushrooms have been shown to have therapeutic uses and are generally safer than alcohol? Or point out the billions (over a trillion since the war on drugs began) of dollars that have be worse-than-wasted, that could have been put to better use in education, prevention, addiction-treatment, and regulation? Everyone, on both sides of the &quot;debate&quot; agrees the WOD has been a failure, and yet it&#039;s still a reality. Isn&#039;t the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting a different result?<br /><br />Do some worthwhile reporting for a change. Be a force for positive change instead of spreading propaganda and sensationalism. Don&#039;t you owe the world an apology for the shit whitehouse-mouthpiece reporting you did that helped get us into Iraq? This could be your attempt at redeeming yourselves. Stop causing damage with your bullshit! Have some balls and speak the truth! Have some compassion for those whose lives have been ruined thanks to the war on drugs.<br /><br />[1] http://www.drugsense.org/cms/wodclock<br />[2] heroin doesn&#039;t actually damage the body like cigarettes do, and nicotine is more addictive

The DEA hasn&#039;t ever managed to reduce violence on the streets or reduce harm in such a dramatic way in its entire history, I&#039;d go further and say it has failed to produce any positive outcome for America period. This works. It doesn&#039;t address whether taking illicits is right or wrong, but it works, and perhaps it is the case that the moral questions of right and wrong cannot be answered by the market, that is not the kind of issue the Silk Road is trying to solve, that is for society and indivduals to decide. You cannot resolve a social issue by interfering with market forces, but you can sure make them a whole lot worse, that is the lesson of the Drug War.

				^^<br /><br />Neither of you seem to get it. This is not Cali. This is an anonymous network. The Tor network cannot be physically shut down.<br /><br />Secondly, LE *already are* spending vast amounts of capital trying to shut us down. The difference between shutting down a RL operation and an operation like SR is that it takes exponentially more effort and resources to obtains results on SR. You cannot climb up a hierarchy using an informant here. Most of us don&#039;t know each other in real life, you have to bust 1 cell at a time.<br /><br />Thirdly, it should be blatantly obvious that the more attention SR receives, the more customers it receives. The more money SR obtains the more powerful its security can become. This is the Red Queen affect. You have to run twice as fast to just keep standing still. <br /><br />More attention = More customers = More LE effort. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = More Security. <br /><br />The disadvantage for LE, is that even if they shut down SR, the idea will have spread elsewhere like a wildfire, the demand of all those customers will create a diverse supply of SR similar hidden services. It&#039;d be like the Cambrian Explosion only for selling product on the Tor network.

				I&#039;m not so sure that SR alone can scale to handle the publicity. However, I completely agree on that last point. Now that this successful idea is out of the bag, expect 10 anonymous markets to go up if SR is ever shut down. I call it the Napster Effect, and it is certainly an e-cambrian-explosion of sorts. Tor and the bitcoin market are independent of SR, and even if they are ever shut down or significantly compromised, other crypto currencies and darknets will likely be created to facilitate the supply of this growing demand. <br /><br />The government could shut down the hidden service if they really wanted to. It&#039;s not easy, nor will it fix the larger &quot;problem&quot;, and they know it. Now if the US sets up a national firewall in an attempt to filter tor and other protocols a la China, then we have a lot more to worry about than Silk Road.

Search the web for: firewall china blocking tor<br /><br />I can totally see some idiot congressman pushing for greater &quot;internet regulation to protect our children&quot; that would result in blocking of all of Tor.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">More attention = More customers = More LE effort. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = More Security. <br /><br />The disadvantage for LE, is that even if they shut down SR, the idea will have spread elsewhere like a wildfire, the demand of all those customers will create a diverse supply of SR similar hidden services. It&#039;d be like the Cambrian Explosion only for selling product on the Tor network.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds like an assumption to me... if they could shut down SR they&#039;d be able to eventually shut down any other hidden service that pops up too. There&#039;s no logic to say it would definitely lead to a &quot;cambrian explosion&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You know what&#039;s an amazing assumption. The idea that if we just keep our heads down, that the DEA will fuck off back home and take a break or something. That is not how this works. The DEA want nothing better than to prevent the Silk Road attaining critical mass whereupon they become a household name and make them a laughing stock across the entire country.<br /><br />The Chinese can bypass the Green Dam software if they know what to do with Tor, it is just that the majority of them like any other bunch of users don&#039;t have the motivation or ability to figure it out. The key word on government actions to block Tor is &#039;lethargic&#039;. They are not very good at it and the Chinese government is not special in that regard, it is just that it throws huge amounts of manpower at problems.<br /><br />Finally, the idea that somehow heightened demand will not result in a greater multiplicity of suppliers is astounding. This darknet market is the New Gold Rush for huge numbers of dealers with the brains to work it out. Unless of course I&#039;m terribly mistaken, and the Gawker article actually resulted in the same or less vendors after publication? Seems to me this thought experiment has already been carried out empirically.<br /><br />Key word in your post is &quot;eventually&quot;. We don&#039;t expect the Silk Road to last for the rest of the century. I do expect the idea that is the Silk Road to live on and influence the course of events irrespective of whether the DEA discover the location of the hidden service and interrupt it. That is kind of the entire point.

No. He still commanded authority and people listened to him, did what he told them to do, etc.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ll bet that a lot more people didn&#039;t like Bush, than people who are against the war on drugs. I don&#039;t see how parading SR around the country, while much of the country thinks &quot;drugs are bad&quot;, is going to accomplish much in the way of changing people&#039;s opinions on the war on drugs. If the opinion is to change, opinion leaders, like the news networks and others, need to call the WOD out for what it is: stupid and hurtful, a menace to society.

You don&#039;t get to interfere in other people&#039;s liberty simply because you disagree with their voluntary choices. This is not the easy way out, it is tough sometimes.

				Okay I&#039;m speaking as if this was or is a real CNN reporter. First thing you need to know that we are exercising what we perceive as being our freedom to choose what we put&nbsp; into our body. The Silk Road is a means of harm reduction, the vendor and buyer agree to make a private transaction and will never meet face to face. Most people would choose to do transactions this way, it takes the danger away from trying to find drugs on the street. <br />Accepting the positive effect of the Road requires a conscious evolution for some people to realize the stereotypes about drugs and users are false, having a war on drugs and mandatory prison sentences for non-violent drug offenses not only wastes time and money but creates broken homes. The&nbsp; drug offender is made to look and feel like a bad person, a bad parent and a criminal. When it was really the gross indoctrination of these drug policy&#039;s that caused it. If someone is addicted and they want help they should be able to get it without being thrown in a cage or being looked down upon by society and their family. <br />We believe that people should be given the choice to make their own rational decisions, isn&#039;t that what freedom is about? Saying that you understand the dangers, you&#039;ve done your research and you accept the consequences to your health is a practice of fundamental freedom. <br />The moment we chose to do our first transaction we made a statement... <br />

				It&#039;s been fun reading this whole thread, superb trolling skills, OP.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ve enjoyed reading some of the very good points made on here and I might as well go ahead and make one more point that I don&#039;t think anybody&#039;s mentioned yet.<br /><br />Tell ya what CNN-one of my friends gets pure mdma on SR to vend locally, in a market plagued with R.C. type bullshit and unsafe additives used to decrease purity and increase profits, and not only does she and her customers no longer have to worry about getting low grade, potentially harmful chemicals, it arrives to her safely and sound.<br /><br />There&#039;s going to ALWAYS be people who experiment with mind altering substances, and we&#039;ve learned (well, seen) from the W.O.D. that throwing away our money and resources is not an effective solution.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are a full blown addict in search of xxxxxxx, this isn&#039;t the place for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are in search of items sold for the sole purpose of harming others, you won&#039;t find those here.<br /><br />If you are under a certain age where you do not have the ability to take the steps needed here to make purchases/orders, you definitely don&#039;t belong here.<br /><br />Point is, there&#039;s more that meets the eye once people find this place and learn about it-but the closed-minded fucks i.e. your employer will say that &quot;Our children can buy drugs like herion and meth online!&quot; just to get people pissed off-but then in the same story give a step by step tutorial on how to access the fuckin place...<br /><br />Media confuses me, but hell-fuck it.&nbsp; The more the merrier, I guess... <br />
