				Yes, that was via PM. Person on with DPR was via torchat most likely. Of course he could have been chatting with many people at the same time.

				Realistically, you can&#039;t trust anyone but yourself. Once a second person knows your secret then the trust is gone or at risk. Very hard to keep everything to yourself forever, it must be human nature to have to talk or get things off ones chest as they say!

It seems clear that, as their conversation seems to have concluded normally (FA was shocked because he was unaware of the arrest at the time), it was not the same conversation that LE interrupted.

				EVERYONE here should act as if EVERYONE else is a &quot;snitch&quot;. Not that they are, of course. But any one of us could be. So never trust anyone. Never post anything or IM anything that could compromise your personal security, or the security of others or one of the markets. Loose lips sink ships. Loose lips are exactly what sunk SR. Specifically, DPR&#039;s loose lips. But some some admin/vendor/customers were also working with or for the fbi/dea.<br /><br />So be really careful. Try not to mention ANY details about yourself, or anyone else, or a shipment, etc. in public, or to anyone you don&#039;t absolutely need to. Things like time zones, personal details like gender/age/race, what kind of work you do or school you go to, etc. can and will be noted by whatever LEOs are here. Put enough of them together and suddenly your anonymity is GONE. <br /><br />Operate as though everyone were LEO (except for your trusted vendors, and remember even they could turn on you easily if they get busted), and stay safe.

				fACE sound as he was PMing PGP with DPR. Many person might be. DPR use torchat and other chats. chat = real time talk. snitch was most likely waiting for DPR to contact him on torchat to verify he was logged into tor while LE watch him in person. Speculation but that most likely. <br /><br />Don think fACE had anything to do but don know, NOBODY KNO!

				Ie ordered from that crew and got opium.&nbsp; Weird thing is 3 weeks later I got more opium but had been out the country and not ordered.&nbsp; My original order had some problems with timing so maybe it was just a thank you.&nbsp; Def not LE but weird that my drop address was potentially saved.<br /><br />I found PM is most likely where LE would lurk asking about an order you make.&nbsp; There was a guy ( our chat on PM&#039;s no trace) who was very dodgy about SAW.&nbsp; Said he had been busted in USA and just been bailed after CD.&nbsp; Before was asking what football team I supported and other strange q&#039;s about transaction.<br /><br />I trust vendors and some fellow users but there is no need to tell anyone too much.&nbsp; Anyway better go enjoy the rest of my holiday!

				This is a funny thread. It seems as thought it was started by a 14 yr old and replied to by other children. <br />News Flash ! - There are many snitches among us. We&#039;re on an open Internet forum where anyone can log in. I don&#039;t really&nbsp; know what else to say other than this is a non issue. Eat your vegetables children and remember: drama is for television.
