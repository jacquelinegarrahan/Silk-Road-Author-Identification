				I&#039;ve seen a lot of vendors being majorly trashed around the rumor mill. And yet when I look at their SR profiles and feedback, they still have near-perfect feedback. So, I ask the question. Just curious.

				I&#039;ve only once left bad feedback, but I guess I&#039;m not afraid if I feel it&#039;s warranted.&nbsp; I received some hash from GlobalDealer a few months ago which tasted like it was 50-60% rubber/plastic and was very weak. I think it was some type of soap bar, definitely not premium dutch hash like I ordered.&nbsp; So for that I left a 1/5.&nbsp; Every other order has been fine and I haven&#039;t been scammed outright so I haven&#039;t had any reason to leave bad feedback besides that one time.&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely leave bad feedback again if I was sold crappy product for a high price.

				I&#039;m not if I know I&#039;m not gonna order from that vendor anymore.&nbsp; If i know i might order and receive shorted order or weaker than decribed what can i do ? These vendors can manipulate orders easily for example if it goes missing and they say they reshipped they could have not reshipped at all. And so on.

				not afraid, but ive reviewed samples and i do see myself exploring reasons that could have influenced my experience. I shy from just plain out saying &quot;it was crap&quot;, unless of course it is total crap.<br />I&#039;m no liar when its crap, i&#039;ll say that. But when the answer is in the grayzone, i&#039;ll put things milder then i sometimes feel.

				I will always give 5/5 on the official SR unless something is truly screwed up.&nbsp; As I only order sweet mary jane, as long as I get smokable green safely they get a 5/5.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be more specific in the forums&nbsp; but I see no need to potentially damage someone&#039;s livelihood over what are preference/perception issues.&nbsp; People seem to forget, your buying illegal drugs online anonymously....you get something that gets you high and you won in my book.&nbsp; &nbsp;
