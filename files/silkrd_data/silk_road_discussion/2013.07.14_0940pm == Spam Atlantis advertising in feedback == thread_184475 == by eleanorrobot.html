				EDIT - do not visit the URL from the feedback places, apparently it is a phishing link. it has been removed from this post.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/bc83b70f3e<br /><br />Scroll down to the feedback. Been seeing this a lot recently. Mods censor out the URL if necessary. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silk Road&#039;s Biggest Competitor: [CENSORED: scam link] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biggest Competition to Silk Road: [CENSORED: scam link] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ER.<br /><br /><br />// just edited to remove the phishing link - hopefully everyone already knew not to visit it, but just in case, i took it out.

				That&#039;s pretty desperate. The sales speak for themselves though, vendors aren&#039;t finding sales, and buyers are facing many scams. Yeah they may have better user interface and lower fees but SR is the original (kinda) and the best. A vendor account is so cheap on Atlantis that people are setting up an account, scamming then just making another.

				That is a phishing URL, not the real Atlantis URL.<br /><br />Which is quite strange, because it must mean they&#039;re ordering and paying for goods (presumably putting in a fake delivery address), then FE&#039;ing and leaving the feedback.<br /><br />In other words (a) someone is going to receive drugs in the post that they didn&#039;t order, or it&#039;ll end up undelivered or whatever, and (b) the phishing URL must be working well enough to make buying some goods worthwhile.
