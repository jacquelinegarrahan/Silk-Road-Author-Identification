				It seems withdrawals are taking a long time right now so I dont know if I messed up for sure. What would happen if I was was withdrawing coins to a wallet and I accident put my wallet addy in but didn&#039;t delete the actual &quot;Bitcoin Address&quot; text and accidentally sent? Would it just get lost in the loop or would it make it back to my account? I dont know I did this for 100% sure as the withdrawals are taking so long but im still curious on what would happen.

				It seems like Silk Road is having a great deal of technical problems lately. At this point I guess the question is what can we do to make the road a better place for all of us. I am a firm believer in constantly improving quality. What if Silk Road had a Peer to peer auditing system like bitcoin does? I personally believe that the administrators keep the users of silk road in the dark too much about what is going on internally ( that may be for our own well being im not sure). <br /><br />Update- about 24hrs later DPR messaged me and credited my account with the missing btc, however I did try to withdraw them again and the same problem seems to be reaccuring
