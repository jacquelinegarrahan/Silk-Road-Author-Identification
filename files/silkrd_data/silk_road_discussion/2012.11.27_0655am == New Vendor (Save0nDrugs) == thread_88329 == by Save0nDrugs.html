				Hello everyone! I just wanted to let everyone know I am going to be selling Rx on SR for the time being. If there is anything I can help anyone with or any suggestions you might have please let me know. I currently have Morphine and Vyvanse up but I plan on expanding over the next few days. I will be posting Hydrocodone, Oxycodone (Percocet and Roxicet), Dilaudid XRs, Methadone, Haldol, Valium, Remeron, Clonazepam, Ativan,and Ambien. Thats off the top of my head what I can think of right now. <br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; Everyone<br />I hope to see a number of you checking me out to see if there is anything I can help you with.<br /><br /><br />Im sorry everyone for not posting my link. Either way here it is<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/363e2b006b<br />
