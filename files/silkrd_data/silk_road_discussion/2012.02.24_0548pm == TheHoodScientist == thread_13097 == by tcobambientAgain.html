				I should be receiving something from him today.<br />I will update you guys.<br /><br />UPDATE: Nothing received. It has been a week since it was shipped. I&#039;m still in escrow and transaction was about $2, so I am not too worried.

				well its day 2 since ive sent him the message and he read it, says he logged in today, i shouldve gotten my package on tuesday or wednesday.<br /><br />let me break it down like this. <br /><br />he logged into his account today, he knows he got a bad rating, he STILL wont respond to my message or come to the forums to defend himself.<br /><br />This means scammer, all signs point to that, I have bought from several scammers in the past and this deja vu all over again. To be honest though he is probably the WORST scammer ive seen in a while. Im just glad i didnt finalize early, that is just retarded, I always find it suspicious when a new vendor requires you finalize early if you have 0 transactions, yet they are just as new as the buyer. <br /><br /><br />either way this douche has been caught, if he turns out to be legit he is just a super bad businessman. I really doubt that though, sounds more like a really bad scammer. I honestly doubt he much to any money doing this.<br /><br />with a name like hoodscientist...I like to think i knew better

I was one of those people that finalized early, but lesson learned for the future. I should have trusted my gut in the first place, but the posters in his thread assured me and called for me to be patient, even when I felt something wasn&#039;t right. Won&#039;t listen to those people again.

				I wish people would stop early finalizing. The escrow system is there for a reason. If a seller requires early finalization, move on. Even new buyers. Or a new buyer, if you really must have the product and the vendor requires early finalization, only buy a quantity you are willing to lose. Don&#039;t be greedy on your first transaction. <br /><br />A vendor who is serious about selling would be well financed and doesn&#039;t need you to finalize early. Even a &quot;trusted&quot; vendor doesn&#039;t need you to finalize early. They can wait. Don&#039;t even do it out of &quot;respect&quot; to the trusted vendor. Anything can happen. Even to the trusted seller. Best thing to do with a trusted vendor is to finalize on delivery. Not after you sampled the product.

				My order was &quot;shipped&quot; 7 days ago, we&#039;re both on the east coast (according to him he is) and I just checked my mail and still nothing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve messaged him and no reply.&nbsp; I was a little leary of him but thought I&#039;d take a chance and just bought a couple of small things to test him.&nbsp; Fuck, everyone has to start out with zero feedback so you have to have some trust in humanity.&nbsp; The guy said all the right things and had good prices but I&#039;m pretty much convinced that the guy is at best a scam or at worst LE.&nbsp; I fucking hate people man.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t understand how or why someone would finalize early on someone that has zero feedback.&nbsp; He got a few people because I look at his profile and there are some people who finalized early.&nbsp; Fucking cocksucker.

Those he has a TON of listings on SR. People should probably be warned to no longer purchase from him until the original orders are done or he is confirmed to be a scammer.

				Man, I really regret finalizing and getting a false sense of trust from the guy. It pisses me off that there are people on top of that, who were appalled at my gut instinct of him being illegitimate. From now on, I will only do business with trusted sellers, and no early finalizing. I lost $100, but I could have lost a lot more, so I&#039;ll take it for what it is. Back to my search for spice. /sigh

				NEVER finalize early with a new vendor (one who has less than 500 transactions). <br /><br />Come on guys, this is common sense. People are out there to rip you off, be smart.
