				To whom it may concern, <br /><br />I, Barack Hussein Obama II have secretly been a big fan of Silk Road. I have always admired and appreciated your work and your way of handling things. Well done for that and I would also like to thank you for lowering the crime rate in the US and many other parts of the world when it comes to drugs.<br /><br />You should not be worried about US government trying to do shit about Silk Road as I would do my best to stop the little fucks.<br /><br />This place is what I was dreaming for in my youth. I will not tolerate dreams being taken away from people, especially not by DEA and other corrupt organizations such as CIA.<br /><br />That being said, stop with the conspiracy theories, rumors about SR going down, bad words about your leader and all this bullshit.<br /><br />This is an official message from your president. You should not worry.<br /><br />Barack Hussein Obama II<br />

				Thank you Barack,<br /><br />I thought I should let you guys know that I have been a user on SR since September 2011. Now, I&#039;m about to die and in collaboration with Barack I made this possible.<br /><br />To all UK Silk Road users:<br /><br />You are safe, there is no reason for you to stop using SR or ever think that SR will stop.<br /><br />Long Live, mine was quite long!
