				I&#039;m new, so correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but are the prices for drugs very high? For example, 1g of Afghan Kush costs around 8 Bitcoins, which is around £50! In the UK, a gram of any weed is £10, so I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m wrong.

				It was like the first listing for weed on this site. I&#039;m sure it was about 8.6 bitcoins, which according to sites is a LOT for 1 gram. I&#039;m hoping MDMA is cheaper, are these normally higher or lower than street prices?

				I haven&#039;t seen weed be that expensive personally. A lot of drugs on Silk Road are more expensive than street price, but some (like MDMA) can be less than the street price. However, that&#039;s the price you pay for quality: with Silk Road, you get substances that have been tested and reviewed, most are good quality, and you don&#039;t have to deal with drug dealers. In exchange for all that, the price may be slightly higher. Look around more though -- there&#039;s definitely cheaper weed than that.

				Reasons why Silk Road is worth it:<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t have to drive to a bad area<br />2. Not going to get robbed<br />3. The drugs will be good if not great<br /><br />Stay in escrow and research the vendor and you will quickly find out why Silk Road is the BEST way to buy what you want.<br /><br />Good Luck!!<br />TJ

				1. SR prices reflect the aggregate worldwide demand from dozens of countries.<br />2. If it is true that prices are high in comparison to your area, quit complaining and realize this is a opportunity to make a mint as a vendor by using geographical arbitrage.<br />3. Some people get this kind of peculiar religion about the prices of drugs. Absolutely sure it is this or that. This is weird, because this is a market, the prices change all the time depending on the time of year or region, it&#039;s not as if we adopt price controls every so often or something. It reminds me of granny saying milk or bread was x dollars in her day. So what?

				SR prices factor a few things into them. <br /><br />1) People like refunds if packages dont make it, an old skool criminal would say, well thats the risk you took, it didnt show, tough shit. But here on SR, if they can put aside a few coins, <br />for shipments that go missing, to remburse, you, then there you go. <br />However if you were happy to take the risk, youd prob get it a lot cheaper and realize that stuff usually shows, and even if it didnt, its not going to cost you as much to get more, as you were paying for protection!<br /><br />2) Bit coins suck, Id want to be compensated for taking such payments too. <br /><br />3) and well if people pay it, then why not. <br />

				Others said it, but it&#039;s true.&nbsp; Vendors here can ask whatever price they want for their products.&nbsp; They set the prices based on supply and demand.&nbsp; They don&#039;t set prices so high that they won&#039;t sell any product.&nbsp; They set the prices out of their own interest--low enough that people will order from the, and high enough that they make profit.&nbsp; Also the escrow system and refunds sometimes give vendors a problem, so many vendors are inclined to make up for it by charging a little more.&nbsp; There are douchebag buyers who try to screw vendors, and there is sometimes little that a vendor can do in order to mitigate that risk.&nbsp; <br /><br />And also, prices of different items in different regions and at different times can fluctuate drastically.&nbsp; An example for me is LSD, which has been literally impossible to find in my area for the past 10ish years.&nbsp; When it was available years ago, it wasn&#039;t cheap.&nbsp; So now when I see LSD on Silk Road going for $15 or even $20 a hit, I&#039;m inclined to buy it, even though I know that in other regions, it can be as low as $1 per hit in the normal market.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s economics.&nbsp; Cannabis is a large portion of the products on SR, so shop around, check out other vendors, check out the reviews, and decide based on that.&nbsp; You may be paying a high premium because the product is simply the best you will ever find, or you may be paying high because the vendor is a greedy bastard.&nbsp; do your research.

				i think prices are high also because btc rate is going UP! :( a week ago it was ~$9 now its ~$11 per bitcoin. omg!<br /><br />rhetorically, vendors, will you be adjusting your prices as btc go up? idc the value of btc, the change of value of btc shud change the value of items! eventually things will be too high it wont be worth it. even tho i dont 100% believe that.

				Hello guys, I&#039;ve asked Dread Pirate Roberts to make a feature to select your product on a price.<br />&nbsp;So everything out of that range will be filtered out.<br />In the Netherlands we have a site called &quot;&quot;marktplaats&quot;&quot; that has that feature and I use it all and every time.<br /><br />So if you wanted to order a weed you should be able to say filter all weeds with a price lower then 8 euro&#039;s out and also the weeds that are more then 10 euro&#039;s.<br /><br />Because most people have a budget and have to spend their money in that budget range.<br />I wrote to Dread Pirate Roberts when he asked what I would like to see changed or added on SR.<br />Even twice.<br />If others agree and now what I mean, maybe it would help if a few people more asked for that same feature.<br />It will be benefitial for the sellers too, to sorted out on their prices instead of best selling or how long they have been selling.<br />And I think it will bring the prices down.<br /><br />It is a feature a lot marketplaces have.<br />With good reason, so pull Dread Pirate Roberts at his coat/jacket and remind him that a good market - site should have such a feature.<br /><br />Greetings, Wasta

				I think you need to shop around more, that seems way to high, even for Kush.<br /><br />To be honest, with local dealers being what they are, more and more people will probably turn to SR. On larger orders the value is way better than any local dealer, plus they&#039;re are a few other perks. You&#039;ve got a community to consult if you&#039;re confused about something, there&#039;s a system in place that means you can easily see if a dealer&#039;s shit is worth purchasing before you whip out the Bitcoins, and the ease of being able to order the stuff to you and not have to go get it yourself(!)<br /><br />I would pay a premium for that, and I&#039;m sure many other people would too, but hey, if you shop around, you don&#039;t need to!

				You have to bare in mind the additional costs that come with DIM (Drugs in Mail), you gotta pay for packaging, stamps, to get to your drops. I will give you that some weed prices are dear here but simple answer is don&#039;t shop with them coz there is plenty of decent shit for less. Also you should bare in mind that the majority of drugs work out to be CHEAPER on SR for the quality. <br /><br />Take the fair Isles that make up the United Kingdom and Ireland. Try getting an 30g of Blow in the U.K for £47 a gram. Not hard you might say and this is perfectly true. What is hard however, is getting 30g of Blow for £47 a gram that is 85-89% pure with a guarantee that it is too. That is shit-hard to impossible if you don&#039;t know people who are maybe 1-2 steps down from importers. MDMA is another fine example of why SR is cheaper. When one goes to London for a rave as I frequently do you get 0.3-0.4g of MD that is crushed and cut to buggery for around £20-30. When I shop on SR I can get 10g for £30 a gram which is complete moon rock and not chopped to shit. <br /><br />So any way you look at it, prices be good son.&nbsp; ;)

				The prices are basically what the market, at any one time, is willing to pay for something. Supply and Demand!! It&#039;s what drives business and industry all over the world. If there is an abundance of something being sold by many people, a price war will eventuate hoping to secure your business with either a lower price for the item or an increased volume for the original purchase price. On the flip side, a price for an item usually increases as it becomes harder to source as buyers typically will pay a premium to secure something they really want. If you observe&nbsp; SR when the BTC rate does rise, vendor prices do drop accordingly, as they should (due to the price being set to the US dollar). Overall for me, things are just fine. :)

				Wadozo above, and many others on this thread, are very clear in describing this phenomenon.<br /><br />My method for determining prices is simply controlled by demand. If I can&#039;t supply the demand, price goes up. If my supply is greater then my demand, price goes down. You and your fellow buyers control the prices. I just do what you tell me. If you have below average demand in your area then prices will appear high, if it is hard to source in your area then prices will appear low.

				I think it all depends on what you want. If the prices are too high then people will obviously go for the cheaper stuff out there but usually that is less potent . My m8 ordered an oz of weed for approx £115 2 months ago , u struggle to find that now. But suspect if you wait around then stuff like that might re-appear, it is an open market really ..<br /><br />this is the 1st time i have been on for months and personally i think prices have risen from last time, end of day , they go up ..they go down ...

I have the luxery to smell and to squeeze the weed. I want my weed sticky and oily and not dry. Weed should not crumble. A good weed will bounce back when squeezed. Releasing a oily smell. And I can not do those things here on SR.<br /><br />@ buybuy555; Use it like the yellowpapers.<br />&nbsp;Google the coffeeshop.<br />&nbsp;Most of them have their own site.<br />&nbsp;You will be able to send a email.<br />&nbsp;A lot of them will not be interested, but sure enough there will be one that does, sooner then you think. <br />You should seek your coffeshop in the nothern parts of the Netherlands. <br />The coffeeshops in southern provinces have a to ask for a I.D. or they will loose their permit to sell weed and hash.

				Well mate if you can buy some banging weed for 10 euros why don&#039;t you resell it on SR? Like I say most people don&#039;t have the luxury of poppin down the shops to buy a bit of weed. Generally they have to go to some chav on a council estate with no teeth. You&#039;d be doing the community a favour for offering such a service and you&#039;d make a bit of dough too.

				everything on here is about double street price from what i can see<br />but thats the whole point - you come here if you want something u cant find on the street<br /><br />i see SR as a last resort TBH considering how easy it is to scam and the amount of fake goods and high price<br /><br />+ you cant punch the guy if they rip u off lol on the streets its street justice
