				I think this is veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery good news... <br /><br />The old URL is still active. I doubt it&#039;d be on a different server, so I&#039;m VERY sure SR just took the site down to make emergency changes and upgrades to prepare for the onslaught of LEO and idiots(redundant, i know).

				The old url doesn&#039;t work for me, it just says &quot;Scheduled maintenence&quot; and the notification of the new URL... <br /><br />Tried new identity etc. but no luck.
