				Man oh man, what is the deal?<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to buy some goodies, and HALF the feedback for the stuff I&#039;m looking at is saying that the stuff never arrived, yet you turkeys still persist in giving 5/5 because you think the vendor was a good bloke giving you 50% back.<br /><br />Okay, let&#039;s put the pipe down and turn on our brains, shall we?<br /><br />If your stuff did arrive and you&#039;re scamming the vendor, then you get half price shit but the vendor still covers their costs or even still makes a small profit, and your rep takes a hit.&nbsp; Do that too many times and nobody will deal with you, so it&#039;s a fucking dumb move.<br /><br />If your stuff didn&#039;t arrive, yeah customs could&#039;ve nabbed it, but the probability is actually very low.&nbsp; Do the sums, the info is out there.&nbsp; If you look at the feedback and there&#039;s a whole heap of no-shows from all over the globe, if you still give 5/5 YOU&#039;RE ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING VENDOR SIDE SCAMMING.<br /><br />If you give 5/5 and the stealth is so shit it&#039;s a miracle it made it, DON&#039;T GIVE 5/5 JUST BECAUSE IT MADE IT!&nbsp; You&#039;re not exactly &#039;raising the bar&#039; are you?&nbsp; Send a clear message that shit stealth won&#039;t be tolerated.<br /><br />So what&#039;s my message?<br /><br />Don&#039;t give 5/5 unless it&#039;s a PERFECT TRANSACTION.<br /><br />PERFECT.<br /><br />Not adequate, not &#039;Yay I got a 50% refund&quot;..........PERFECT.<br /><br />Less than absolutely perfect, give a 4.<br /><br />If you insist on being a Sheeple and blindly giving 5/5, you&#039;re fucking it for everyone else because nobody can tell if a vendor really is any good or not.&nbsp; Seriously, there are vendors on here who are quite big and have atrocious hit-rates and yet everyone seems hell bent on giving them 5/5.&nbsp; I&#039;ll even go so far to insist that some larger vendors know they can get much higher prices on the street for a certain product, but as it&#039;s one of a dozen they offer on SR and you clowns keep giving them 5/5, they can hide the no-shows (or should I say, the &#039;never sents&#039;) really easily, and it doesn&#039;t effect their stats.<br /><br /><br />SO DON&#039;T GIVE 5/5 UNLESS THE TRANSACTION IS PERFECT!!!!!!!!<br /><br />M&#039;kay?<br /><br />:)<br /><br />Discuss.

				I agree. The whole feedback system is kind of fucked up though. Leave less than a 5, and the vendor puts you on the &quot;blacklist&quot;. Not sure exactly what that is, but I think it means that other vendors may not let you order from them. If everyone left honest feedback, an average score of 4 would be fine. As it is now, I wouldn&#039;t order from a vendor that has less than 4.8ish. It puts everyone in a bad spot really.

				I&#039;m also a fan of the 4/5 for such situations as described above. I&#039;m sure vendors appreciate when they still get a 5/5 when a shipment has a problem or gets nabbed. I mean, anything less and it&#039;s adding insult to injury. <br /><br />However, this is business. Let&#039;s assume the vendor has had their shipments nabbed. An accurate portrayal of, say, the effectiveness of their stealth through the postal service is important to the buyers in such instances, and gives proper incentive for vendors to go above and beyond, even when they have done a good job in the past. <br /><br />Safety is prime here, and I can&#039;t in good conscience give a stellar review to a transaction that provided anything less than the peace of mind SR transactions have been known to come with. It&#039;s risky enough doing business at all; but doing business and giving inaccurate numerical reviews can put us more at risk, especially if they mask a vendor&#039;s sub-par stealth.

				You see things like &quot;never arrived in 3 weeks but got s refund so it&#039;s OK&quot;.<br /><br />NO, it&#039;s not fucking OK. You do not leave a 5 unless the transaction is flawless and all you are doing is helping buyers get messed around more.

				I think it&#039;s not actually reasonable to rate an item you never received in the first place. What I would like to see is an additional option to declare that a rating is not applicable because it never arrived. I&#039;d also love to see the success rate for a vendor derived from this information.<br /><br />This prevents the merging of two separate concerns into one rating and makes it easier for customers fearing they&#039;d come onto any kind of black list.

				If a vendor sends your order, and it gets nabbed and they give you a refund then of course the deserve a 5/5. You do realize most items get caught because the BUYERS address is being watched? The vendor is losing the product and the money and you are getting a refund.<br /><br />My listings promise I will send the package and if it does not arrive I give a 50% refund. About 0.8% of the time it does not arrive(or the buyer claims it did not arrive) and I give the refund I promised. I am meeting my end of the agreement so I deserve a 5/5.<br /><br />Buyers who blame the vendor when customs nabs a package are the type of buyers I choose not to deal with again. This shit is illegal and it is not all going to get through, we both share the risk. Taking the attitude that a vendor should be punished for this is a great way to lose your buying priviledges.<br /><br />Remember, for every 10 people who claim it did not arrive there are about 3-5 people lying about it.

To me, a 50/50 equal share of the loss is completely fair, especially for a vendor with a proven history of successful deliveries.<br /><br />However, I don&#039;t agree with the notion that most packages that are intercepted are a result of a buyer&#039;s address being watched (in my country anyway). Firstly, for an address to be watched, the buyer would have had to previously had an order or two (depending on the quantity of course) intercepted resulting in the address being flagged. You would hope that most buyers are smart enough to know that if an order doesn&#039;t arrive, they don&#039;t order anything else to the same address ever again, although I&#039;m sure there are always exceptions to the rule. As you said, it is an illegal act that is being carried out and as such, shit will inevitably be intercepted on occasions, that&#039;s a given. However, stealth packaging is an art and some vendor&#039;s are better at it than others. I can honestly say that I have a 100% success rate with the few O/S vendors I&#039;ve been using which is due to the incredible lengths some vendors go to when packaging your order.<br /><br />If the vendor sends the item and it doesn&#039;t arrive, a 50/50 equal share refund is the only fair option IMO and a 5/5 feedback score should be left if that is agreed to. It&#039;s not a perfect, fool proof system and shit does happen occasionally.

				Both sides have enough reason to argue into oblivion.&nbsp; Although, I do agree on the feedback system being beyond repair now.&nbsp; <br /><br />It would be great if everyone would understand that receiving your package or it being sent out and you receiving a refund shouldn&#039;t constitute as a 5/5 transaction. <br /><br />Most 5/5 vendors have at least 1 problem with every transaction (quality, packaging, communication, ect). If stats were wiped and the 1-5 ratings were described explicitly for what feedback should be assigned in the most common cases, then there would certainly be alot more confidence in product quality, packaging, affability, professionalism, and other aspects of a transaction that are currently being overlooked.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most people just orgasm over receiving a package or a fraction of their money back, and it is hurting the ability to research what vendors to purchase from.

I believe that if a vendor delivers my order and it&#039;s what was described in the listing, then they deserve a 5/5. Sure, maybe their communication could use a little work, but some vendor&#039;s are a one man team and others have trusted individuals that may help them (packaging, drop offs to the Post Office/Box, etc) meaning some have more time to engage in conversation while some don&#039;t have much time at all to chat. There&#039;s no doubt they could all improve in one way or another but if my order arrives and it contains what I ordered then that&#039;s a 5/5 every time.<br /><br />PS - I hardly think buyers orgasm over receiving a fraction of their money back, although it is better than nothing, but I can see a buyer having an orgasm when a package arrives!!<br />

				I disagree with this thread for one reason. International shipping. With international shipping, especially with some items, a lot of the times items get confiscated, intercepted, etc, even with tracking. The vendor can only do so much in some cases with some items. <br /><br />I know it&#039;s an inherent risk when ordering from international vendors. Importing MDMA from a vendor overseas in 100-500g amounts, there is an obvious factor that even with the best stealth, it could get discovered. I would not expect the vendor give me a full refund... that&#039;s a shitload of money. This is where tracking/trust comes in. The risk is just inherent and obvious when ordering internationally, and I dont think a lot of people realize this. Interational orders are 99% of the orders that are listed as &quot;did not arrive&quot; etc. <br /><br />

I have never gotten a 4 and I want to keep it that way. I would not mind getting a 95/100 if I was not great. Having the buyer have to choose between perfect 100% good and 20% terrible/80% good is not a cool situation for buyers. No wonder they always choose 5/5. Please ask for a better choice than 1-5.

Out of the 300+ packages I&#039;ve ordered ( and I&#039;d say about a third international) and I&#039;ve only lost international packages. I&#039;d say about 10%. At the beginning though it was mostly from the Netherlands. I&#039;ve learned to avoid that country.&nbsp; Others were just caught by customs. I received a love letter once (not the only) and accidentally forgot to remove that drop from rotation. I received 3 or 4 more international packages at the address.<br /><br />I try to choose only vendors that offer at least a 50% refund on lost packages but completely understand those who don&#039;t or require FE. I won&#039;t shop with them but I believe their policy is reasonable.&nbsp; I&#039;m still amazed that some of you get through to Australia and Sweden.<br /><br />THREAD HIJACK: Just a side note, I was considering ordering from a vendor in Turkey but haven&#039;t read anything about them being on a watch list. ny info y&#039;all?

				I see this a lot with Haizenberg. People say &quot;oh my stuff never arrived&quot; and just give him 5/5 because he&#039;s gotten a lot of 5/5 ratings (while writing that it never showed). It&#039;s as if people are scared to give a bad rating. If your stuff doesn&#039;t show don&#039;t be a pussy, let people know!

				Show me proof of extensive, systematised address watching in Australia.<br /><br />Show me evidence that Australian customs is better or more effective than any other country.<br /><br />Until ANYONE can furnish me PROOF of either of the above, you&#039;re opinion is complete and utter unresearched, heresay bullshit.&nbsp; Perpetuating convenient untruths.<br /><br />Just prove it.<br /><br />Just point to one solitary piece of evidence that even vaguely suggests either of these propositions are true.<br /><br /><br />------------------------<br /><br /><br />Look, I understand some vendors posting on here that are clearly upset, how about some objectivity?&nbsp; It&#039;s not personal, I just want a better system for all :)<br /><br />What do we know for sure about what happens?<br /><br />1. Shipping standards are clearly (still) universally shit.<br />Vendors didn&#039;t even know vac sealed PE takes a whole 15 minutes before sniffer dogs could detect it, until a few months ago. &quot;5/5 good stealth!&quot; used to be (or maybe even still is) a PE bag thrown in an envelope with a couple of sheets of paper.&nbsp; This myth was perpetuated by vendors at the risk of buyers safety, in lieu of them actually doing their job properly.&nbsp; And buyers perpetuated it.&nbsp; Well done, us.<br /><br />2. Australia is such a hard country!<br />Despite absolutely no evidence to the contrary, the myth of Australia somehow being &#039;hard&#039; has been attributed to:<br /><br />a) Australia is a long way away, as if mail has never been sent here before and you&#039;re some fucking Marco Polo.<br /><br />b) Lots of packages have gone missing because we&#039;re, well, Australians, and therefore must be a whole bunch of scammers for no rational reason.&nbsp; Could it be that maybe there&#039;s just as many scammers here as anywhere, it&#039;s just that your shipping standards are shit?&nbsp; Nah, that can&#039;t be it!&nbsp; We&#039;re CONVICTS!<br /><br />c) Your customs are amazing.&nbsp; Yeah, they&#039;re cybernetic beagle ninjas.&nbsp; Oh wait, there&#039;s no proof they&#039;re any different to anywhere else.<br /><br />There is absolutely no evidence of ANY of the above.&nbsp; NONE.<br /><br /><br />So what FACTS (no, actual real, indisputable ones) are there?<br /><br />1. If a vendor offers a 50% refund rate and doesn&#039;t ship, they get 50% for doing nothing.&nbsp; Winner - VENDOR<br /><br />2. If they do this - especially to Aussies - they know both that: a )&#039;the myths prevail!&#039; and b) they&#039;ll still get 5/5 anyway.&nbsp; Winner - VENDOR<br /><br />3. If they do send and the buyer scams claiming a no-show, the vendors costs are still covered.&nbsp; Buyer gets half price drugs, vendor covers their costs or maybe even makes a small profit.&nbsp; Vendor gets 5/5, buyer takes a refund rate hit. Winner - hrm......DRAW?<br /><br />Now, as a comment about that.&nbsp; In the Real World, companies amortise &#039;warranty&#039; into their sell price.&nbsp; So WTF is stopping vendors doing that also?&nbsp; Bueller?&nbsp; No, there is no good reason, aside from being lazy and not having any business sense, or a desire to monitor their business in any meaningful way.&nbsp; It&#039;s easier just to rip people off.<br /><br /><br />---------------------<br /><br /><br />So anyway, looking forward, this is where my thoughts are at the moment......<br /><br />1. Feedback needs to not be out of 5.&nbsp; People have mentioned this earlier and I think that&#039;s a great idea - it should be out of 100, and ratings should be for, and weighted:<br /><br />• Customer Service / Professional Conduct (25%)<br />• Product Quality (45%)<br />• Shipping Standards (40%)<br /><br />(SR should have guidelines for all these things, btw)<br /><br />Buyers could have ratings, too.<br /><br />• Contribution to Community / Courteousness / Fairness (10%)<br />• Monthly refund rate (10%)<br />• All-Time refund rate (25%)<br />• Number of successful transactions (30%)<br />• Value of successful transactions (25%)<br /><br />(I pulled these out of my arse, but you get the idea) :)<br /><br />2. You should be able to view stats at the click of a button for not only the particular listing you&#039;re looking at, as well as total for the vendor. (Some large vendors with many products are clearly using one of the products as a deliberate &#039;red herring&#039; - having heaps of no-shows on the one product, people still give them 5/5 anyway, and it doesn&#039;t effect their global rating.&nbsp; One click to see if a vendor for some reason can magically ship one type of product but not another is a good thing. (Coke looks just like Molly to an xray machine or dog when it&#039;s wrapped in an MBB, assholes.)<br /><br />3. I&#039;d like to see stats on location, but that might be revealing too much to LE.&nbsp; There needs to be a mechanism however to see which countries really are problematic, or ones that are hot at any given time. Perhaps countries or regions could be colour coded based on:<br /><br />a) &#039;selling into&#039; rates of success<br />b) &#039;buyer&#039; ratings?<br /><br />That way avoiding anything that reveals volumes.<br /><br />(Honestly, the amount of information going through SR is incredibly fascinating and so much could be done with it, it&#039;s not even funny)<br /><br />4. There should be more incentives to promote good buyers.&nbsp; The more you spend, the more transactions you have, should come with increased privileges and more favourable T&amp;C&#039;s.&nbsp; Written in stone, not &#039;cap in hand&#039;.<br /><br />5. There should be a global T&amp;C for sellers.&nbsp; Allowing vendors to bypass Escrow rules for example is rubbish - it encourages scamming and damages growth of the PR brand by opening newbies up to exploitation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, there goes an hour, typing shit.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone who is contributing!

The claim that they do not is an exceptional one and it is exceptional claims that require proof.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yowie is correct when he says that Australian Customs is no more difficult to get packages through than most other western countries such as the US or the UK. As I&#039;ve said before, the US vendor I&#039;ve been using for well over a year now has a 100% successful delivery record with both myself and 2 of my mates. The &quot;business letter&quot; method has had it&#039;s day IMO and while it may still work for some, Customs are paying more attention to letters now than ever before.<br /><br />The Australian Federal Police don&#039;t have the manpower or the resources to watch an address where a gram of drugs were sent to, especially when the person who&#039;s name is on the envelope either doesn&#039;t exist or live at the address. Remember, in Australia we NEVER use our real names on our O/S orders as unlike the US, Australia Post doesn&#039;t use software which relates a name to an address when sorting. I could address a letter to Mr Dick Head and as long as the address itself was correct, it would be delivered just fine. Your address may be watch if the amount seized is a commercial quantity or Customs intercept more than one package to the same address. However, any buyer who orders again to an address where a seizure was made is stupid and any vendor who sends a re-ship to the same address where a seizure was just made is equally as stupid. <br /><br />Of course our Government is out to put a stop to any drug shipments getting through Customs at our boarders and so is every other Government from around the world. That doesn&#039;t mean shit can&#039;t get through cause it definitely can.It means vendors who want to ship to O/S countries have to keep improving and developing new techniques and ideas. Most Australian buyers will be more than happy to pay extra for a vendor to take the time to stealthily package their product with quality materials. This notion that Australia is a problem destination is a myth and with over 150 orders to my name, I&#039;m living proof. If one vendor can do it, there&#039;s no reason others can&#039;t either.
