				I got this message today<br /><br />&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,<br /><br />I am a French journalist working on a 52 minutes documentary about the deep web and anonymous black markets such as Silk Road. This subject is not well known in France and our main goal is to make it understandable by a large audience.<br />The documentary will be broadcast on the French channel “13ème rue” and is produced by the TV press agency “Elephant &amp; Cie”. You can check our website here (there is a documentary section) :<br />http://www.elephant-groupe.com/<br />We have a serious confidentiality of sources policy and I insist on our strong ethics.<br /><br />We will specially stay on the Silk Road case because we want to show that this website is more than just a drug place. The interesting aspect for us is to explain that there is an ideology behind, such as freedom, anonymity, respect and responsibility. This aspects can be the more surprising for the audience because it breaks the immediate clichés about such a black market place. We also want to put things in perspective : concerning drugs for example, it more about quality than quantity… We know that you can’t buy or sell huge amounts of drugs on Silk Road and it makes a big difference with the drug cartels.<br /><br />In order to make that documentary complete and objective, it’s very important for us to have a Silk Road seller’s opinion. Of course, it would be a complete anonymous interview and we could meet you anywhere you live.<br />To understand how this site works and what is the ideology behind, we want to hear the people who are using it regularly…<br />We have plenty of questions such as :<br /><br />-How do you have discovered Silk Road ?<br />-Why have you chosen to sell on Silk Road ?<br />-Is it complicated to start ?<br />-What about the bitcoins ?<br />-Is it hazardous ?<br />-What are the kind of customers ? Are they coming from every part of the globe ?<br />-Where were you selling before being on Silk Road ?<br />-What Silk Road has changed in your life ?<br />-What is the future of this kind of website for you ?<br /><br />We will be mostly shooting the film during the month of June in the USA. The film maker is named Loïc Thon Tat.<br /><br />Please feel free to let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.<br /><br />Best regards.<br /><br />Nancy Correia<br /><br />e-mail : n.correia@elephant-cie.com<br />+33 (0)1 56 21 37 78&quot;<br /><br />I am very sure this is a LE attempt to catch a few vendors, so be careful!

				It definitely sounds pretty fishy. The names mentioned are all completely bogus and it&#039;s not even written properly, they use &quot; ’ &quot; instead of &quot; &#039; &quot;for apostrophes, and a foreign journalist would at least use an official translator I think.

				I&#039;m not French nor am I a vendor but my gut instinct is to ignore and avoid anyone claiming to be a journalist who wants to report about the Silk Road.&nbsp; Unless you already know someone personally and they are trustworthy and *happen* to be a journalist then I&#039;d stay far away.&nbsp; Even then you&#039;d have to be vigilant to make sure that you remained anonymous.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think any of us have much to gain from these journalist stories anyway.&nbsp; More often than not the facts are misrepresented and cast the SR in a negative light.&nbsp; Just do a quick cost vs. benefit analysis and you&#039;ll get the idea.&nbsp; Plus if they&#039;re just some small-time journalist from some small TV news show then keep in mind they aren&#039;t exactly on the level of Wikileaks or National Geographic when it comes to keeping their sources anonymous (not completely sure how Wikileaks and NG are about this to be honest but you get the point).

				Any seller would be absolutely crazy to meet someone on SR in person for something like this (or anything for that matter).<br /><br />I suppose you could do a torchat to provide them answers to their questions - but I don&#039;t see how this would be beneficial to yourself or anyone on SR.

				Is it just me or does anyone else Not like seeing/hearing about Silk Road being in the media on some News story or Documentary or something main stream that LOTs of people from the general public see.<br /><br />I get a bad feeling everytime that I hear of these storys Because the more eyes and attention on this place&nbsp; the Bigger the target its going to have and makes it more dangerous for the people like us who use it. I still get worked up thinking about how long this will go on for and how/if it will come crashing down and who/how many people will get fucked in the process.<br /><br />Just Some thoughts going thru my drug fueled mind tonite. What do others think about this??? Im curious on your thoughts/opinions

				It&#039;s not just you bro, I think most of us feel the same way ... sadly the &#039;mainstream media&#039; distort the truth for sensationalism which attracts buyers/viewers which is the main reason why.<br /><br />Alas I dont think it&#039;s possible to cover the enormity of the SR&#039;s &#039;value&#039; to the community ... not while there are SO many who &#039;believe&#039; in the WoD&#039;s ... <br /><br />The ignorance of the masses is our biggest obstacle!<br /><br /><br />m m m

				Even if this was really a reporter (which is not unlikely), I would suggest that you immediately delete such messages. Any vendor that answers these questions does not have the best interest of the silkroad at heart. Any attention at this point is negative attention and needs to be avoided.

				I must admit I am a little puzzled why people think that slight mistakes in otherwise very good English = LE. Have you ever spoken to a french person? That&#039;s pretty much how they sound.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I imagine LE would use much worse English....it would be handwritten in crayon<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;What is your name and address?

				Pretty hilarious effort on whoever sent that&#039;s part, but on a more serious note I really hope nobody ends up putting their clients in danger by filling one of these &quot;interviews&quot; out. Also, agree with the idea that less attention to SR would be nice. In this case all attention is not good attention. Stay safe y&#039;all.

				Journalism articles are not what we need for &#039;good publicity&#039; or public awareness. They&#039;ll most likely just skew the fuck out of it and make the public scared. I don&#039;t think journalists can really be trusted because they rely so much on what people want to hear, at least a little bit anyways if they want to have a positive public response.<br /><br />What we need are more scholarly case studies, like one that was posted a few weeks ago called &#039;a case study of a single user&#039;s experience on SR&#039; or something like that. Academics who don&#039;t give a fuck how the public will view what they find researching the road, the public opinion of it will not really effect their career - unlike a journalist

				I don&#039;t know if this is legit, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s LE. If the logic is &quot;A foreign journalist would never...&quot; then surely the logic must also be &quot;A police sting would never...&quot;<br /><br />It seems to me that the war on drugs is increasingly being questioned in much more mainstream circles now than it was a decade or more ago. The media are going to report on the Silk Road whether people give interviews or not, and people have already and will continue to give interviews.<br /><br />Some mainstream organisations (like The Guardian) are doing pretty objective and positive stuff on the silk road, even if the tone is still one of fear. It&#039;s worth remembering that &quot;the mainstream media&quot; is not the same in different countries, and even though it may never question some of the same things, it does represent a different set of interests and circumstances. Before deciding to give any interview, look at the work that journalist has done. Look at the publication they are writing for. What do you think of it? Do they do &#039;moral panic&#039; stories, where the aim is to frighten the reader? Or do they do informative pieces designed understand something you may have previously found frightening? Ask the journalist what their opinions are, how they got interested etc. Does it sound convincing?<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the idea of &#039;never give interviews&#039; ever because publicity is bad. The Silk Road isn&#039;t hiding anymore. The more people using it, the harder it becomes to stop. People are beginning to know about the Silk Road. As that number increases, more people will write about it. At the moment they know of it, but they don&#039;t know about it and when it gets big enough that blank will begin to be filled in. Most people who would never use the Silk Road but have heard of it would be very pleasantly surprised by the way it functions with such success and guarantees much higher quality leading to much safer drug use, for example. On top of that, you have the complete absence of violence. &quot;It&#039;s revolutionizing the drug deal!&quot; etc... Basically, I think there&#039;s a lot of room in the current climate of very harsh (if overdue) mainstream criticism of the drug war for a positive narrative of SR.<br /><br />Not telling anyone what to do though. If you don&#039;t want to give an interview, don&#039;t.

				Having nothing better to do atm I wrote an answer to this. Should I send it to her?<br /><br />&quot;I am a French journalist working on a 52 minutes documentary about the deep web and anonymous black markets such as Silk Road. This subject is not well known in France and our main goal is to make it understandable by a large audience.&quot;<br /><br />Recent years the internet has become more easy to monitor, therefore to protect one self from surveillance from the state or other institutions/companies a counterculture has appeared which tries to protect ones anonymity. Tor has been a major contribution to this, the tor project has protected dissidents and journalists in China, during the Arabian spring, and also those who are dissidents from the current market economy. Your focus should rather be on how it is possible to apply counter politics on the deep web, and then maybe mention silkroad as an example in reference to this. <br /><br />&quot;We have a serious confidentiality of sources policy and I insist on our strong ethics.&quot; <br /><br />Your suggestion of meeting in person shows that your &quot;confidentiality of sources policy&quot; isn&#039;t serious enough. <br /><br />&quot;We will specially stay on the Silk Road case because we want to show that this website is more than just a drug place.&quot;<br /><br />-- It is a market place with that has an agoristic philosophy. Since drugs are a substance which is illegal in most places to sell and distribute it is natural that this becomes the dominating product of such a market place. --<br /><br />&quot;We also want to put things in perspective : concerning drugs for example, it more about quality than quantity…&quot;<br /><br />When it comes to the products of silkroad we have a free marketplace which improves the your choices as a buyer. To survive in a free market you have to be able to compete on things like service, quality and price. Service is probably the most cost efficient things to improve, therefore most sellers are very pleasant to interact with as a buyer. <br />If you have a product of good quality this can easily become known to customers at silkroad if you have a &quot;vendor review-thread&quot; on the forums or if you are mentioned in a &quot;review of *****-vendors threads&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;We know that you can’t buy or sell huge amounts of drugs on Silk Road and it makes a big difference with the drug cartels.&quot;<br /><br />You can, but I would not advice to do that. And I do not think it is the ones who distribute large amounts of drugs silkroad was created for. Its more for individual who wish to oppose the current system in a more secure way it is designed for.<br /><br />And it also protects the identity of the buyers and sellers so therefore this marked do not have the violence associated with drug cartels. It is frowned upon if a seller misuses the identifying details he/she gets from a buyer and if this is done the seller will lose his account. He/she can make a new account, but the creditability the seller gained on the last account will be lost so the prize of misusing the buyers info is in most cases higher than what can be gained from misusing a customers information.<br /><br />&quot;In order to make that documentary complete and objective, it’s very important for us to have a Silk Road seller’s opinion. Of course, it would be a complete anonymous interview and we could meet you anywhere you live.&quot;<br /><br />This is my address: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion <br />you can come visit anytime you&#039;d like :)<br /><br />&quot;-How do you have discovered Silk Road ?&quot;<br /><br />It was to in an attemt to protect my anonymity I stumbled upon tor and hidden services. Silkroad was the far most active forum I found and I&#039;ve learned many things after my arrival.<br /><br />&quot;-More questions ?&quot;<br /><br />Not a seller, so I do not have any good answers for you here.

				Ignore, ignore and ignore! <br /><br />Why would anyone who actually uses the Road want to have any converse with media and certain LEO&#039;s (hey it has been known that they monitor journalists for some time, the present Incident is just par for the coarse)? We are here for our personal and Anonymous reasons, anon being the most important! Meeting someone from the Tor realm only endangers us all in a World with less and less privacy. Keep your actions here private or you will end up meeting someone like Sabu...&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />mushmold

				If you plan on replying to them, I put more a bigger emphasis on &quot;we want to show that this website is more than just a drug place.&quot;, if they write an article or make a documentary, showing them how the silkroad is a good thing could make them show silkroad on a good light. I think a TV documentary about that would cause much more LE attention in France, and then in the EU so it wouldn&#039;t be so good... Unless they convince the general population that there&#039;s nothing wrong with drugs bought from SR.

				I like how the standard response to anything is &quot;Must be LE!&quot;.<br /><br />Everyone is LE. Everyone on SR is actually LE, and we&#039;re all just LE selling drugs to other LE. No one is not LE.<br /><br />

				The Silk Road isn&#039;t a charity. If you&#039;re going to write a journalist&#039;s article for her, demand payment up front or in escrow. <br /><br />
