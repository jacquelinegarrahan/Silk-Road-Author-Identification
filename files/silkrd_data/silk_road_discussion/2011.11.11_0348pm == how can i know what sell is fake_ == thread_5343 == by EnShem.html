				Feedback is related to the number next to the name of the vendor, the higher the number the better the vendor (usually). Also, at the bottom of the vendor&#039;s profile page there are comments about how past transactions went, very useful resources!

				I would strongly suggest spending a week reading through all the sticky posts on every forum here before attempting to make any kind of purchase.&nbsp; For your own safety whether it be for security, or ensuring legitimacy with vendors and their products.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a good practice to contact the vendor before making any transactions so you can &quot;feel them out&quot;.

				This is my process:<br /><br />1. Pick out something I want.&nbsp; Look at the feedback on the sale page.<br /><br />2. Click on the sellers name in the sales listing.&nbsp; Read and re-read all the information there.&nbsp; Take note of how long the seller has been on SR and how many transactions he/she has had.&nbsp; Look at all the sellers feedback and score (number beside their name). <br /><br />3. Go to the forum and search the sellers name.&nbsp; Read everything, and pay attention to what is recent and what is older information.&nbsp; If the seller hasn&#039;t been mentioned on the forum (good or bad), move on.&nbsp; <br /><br />4.&nbsp; Message the seller.&nbsp; Surely you have a question by now. Does he/she respond?&nbsp; How timely is the response?&nbsp; What is your gut saying after the response?<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Make your decision.<br /><br />Caveat:&nbsp; I am new at this with only a few purchases under my belt (and one scam).&nbsp; And apparently I am a sucker for nice people.&nbsp; But I am learning!<br /><br />Good luck and keep reading - that is your best offense/defense!<br />

				The title and post asked two different things. Everyone has failed to mention the main aspect that protects buyers on SR... escrow. Escrow is where SR holds the bitcoins until the goods arrive, then the buyer will finalize and the payment is sent to the vendor. If the package doesnt arrive or is bunk than you dispute the purchase and can get (at least part of) your money back. Unless you are less than intelligent and finalize early there is minimal risk of being scammed. Check out the SR wiki that is now up.<br /><br />A good rule is still considering anything on SR a gamble. Dont gamble with money you cant afford to lose. You could upload bitcoins and then wait a couple weeks to order but the value could fall a dollar and you lose 1/3 of your money. Bitcoins get sent to the wrong addresses, or even worse you could lose ALL your bitcoins fairly easily if you are not careful. Never sign into silk road from links (especially the hidden wiki). Memorize the url or you will risk being scammed seriously.
