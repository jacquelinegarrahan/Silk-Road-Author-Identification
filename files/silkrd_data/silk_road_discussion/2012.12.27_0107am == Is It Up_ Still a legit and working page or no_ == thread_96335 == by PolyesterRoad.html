				Anyone know or still use the &quot;Is It Up&quot; webpage for status of the road?&nbsp; Haven&#039;t been able to get on today or tonight still so I figured I&#039;d pop on that ol&#039; link I had around to check it out and it is showing No. But I don&#039;t even know if the site itself is even any good anymore, so I figured I better check with my roadies! :) Any feedback would be great! Thanks guys!<br /><br />Is it up?:<br />http://zw3crggtadila2sg.onion/downornot/index.php?url=silkroadvb5piz3r.onion

Don&#039;t know why a lot of people have trouble with it; I seem to be lucky. <br /><br />On the link you provided, the message:<br /><br />Is silkroadvb5piz3r.onion up?<br />Yes (but with 302 error) <br /><br />..........came up, but when I did a fresh search on a new page, the message:<br /><br />Oh no! silkroadvb5piz3r.onion seems to be down!<br /><br />..........came up. I am currently logged in. Not sure what the problem is, I would disregard.<br />

				I believe it was WarWeed who made that script to indicate whether SR is up or down. It hasn&#039;t worked in a long while. Last time it worked was before SR was updated with the new format and design. So that would be months ago was the last time that link worked. <br /><br />As for not being able to get on, have you tried clicking &quot;new identity&quot; on the Vidalia control panel? That often solves many issues.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can also use onion.to which is a Tor Proxy to see if SR is up/dn. Just type onion.to in your tor browser then enter Silk Road&#039;s URL. Once it&#039;s up, don&#039;t login. Instead you can open another tab on your tor browser and load silk road&#039;s address from there. That little trick has worked for a number of people.&nbsp;
