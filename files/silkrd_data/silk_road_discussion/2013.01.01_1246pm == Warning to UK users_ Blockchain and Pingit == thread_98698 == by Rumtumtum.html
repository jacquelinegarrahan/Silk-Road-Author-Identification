				Just a heads-up. Probably not too surprising at this time of year but, whoever&#039;s running the show at Blockchain appears to have gone AWOL as several people have been waiting more than 24 hours to receive their Bitcoins after making deposits using Pingit:<br /><br />(CLEARNET!) https://blockchain.zendesk.com/entries/22849288-money-not-appearing-in-wallet-after-pingit-deposit<br /><br />Probably best to get your coins elsewhere for the time being. <br /><br />Peace out (and happy new year!)

				What is strange is that that page has been removed. There was also a thread on here earlier about the problem, that has also been deleted....

				Smells like psyops in here.<br /><br />... Also, if this is real, Pingit is probably the problem, not blockchain.

That means the merchant doesn&#039;t end up getting their money.&nbsp; They&#039;re out the cash &amp; the merchandise.&nbsp; Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed or disputed.&nbsp; They more or less either are finished and the coins are in someone elses hands, or they don&#039;t go anywhere to begin with (oversimplified, but that&#039;s the basic reason nobody accepts anything but cash for BTC).

Use transferwise.com to make a transfer to bitcoin-central.net in Euros, as the latter has a French bank account; this takes a couple of days. <br /><br />2. On bitcoin-central.net, trade your Euros for Bitcoins. If you bid at a rate that someone else is already listed as selling at, it will get accepted straightaway.

				Yeah, don&#039;t go looking for the thread now - the site owner eventually turned up to find over 100 posts from people raging about not getting a response to their support tickets. Things were beginning to get a little heated. Since then they&#039;ve deleted every thread with negative feedback but to their credit have, as far as I&#039;m aware, sorted everyone out with their coins and waived the fees. <br /><br />
