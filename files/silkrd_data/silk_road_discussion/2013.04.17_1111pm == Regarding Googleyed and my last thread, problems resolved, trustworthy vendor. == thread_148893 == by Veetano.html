				This thread probably belongs in rumors but I figure posting it here is better because more people will see it. This is more or less a public apology and a retraction of my previous statements about him as he has taken the right action to resolve the situation.<br /><br />There was a big ordeal that ultimately resulted from several misunderstandings, by SR Resolution Managers, Googleyed, and myself, that resulted in me losing possession of my 14 bitcoins without having an item in my hands. After a bunch of communication to resolve the misunderstanding, Googleyed offered a 50% refund, which originally I wasn&#039;t going to accept, but after consideration figured it was only fair and right since he had to pay his suppliers for the items that got lost in the mail.<br /><br />If my math is correct, even with this partial refund due to bitcoin fluctuations neither parties lost any money in the transaction, and we both even profited a bit. I am glad to have done business with him even if it did not work out, and I would happily do business with him again, though I&#039;m likely to shy away from the international shipments. <br /><br />I am not ashamed to admit that my original anger in the situation after feeling like I was scammed led me to be a bit over the top, and act a bit like an asshole, but needless to say we were able to work this out in a reasonable manner. I admit that I equally share the blame of this happening with him(and the resolution managers), as the misunderstanding resulted from my message that was not entirely clear, and somewhat informal, and his assumption about what it meant. I could have been clearer, and this is my public apology.<br /><br />Googleyed is a trustworthy vendor who responds in a timely, yet professional manner - even if our arguments did get a bit heated. I have no problem with doing business with him again or trusting him.

				It&#039;s a shame to see you post this after your other thread claimed the exact opposite and would have at least allowed buyers to understand what they were getting into.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad you were able to work it out with the vendor, but I&#039;m sad to see that you&#039;ve deleted your initial honest thread.
