				I originally posted this inquiry in the Technical Support forum several weeks ago, but I never received any replies.<br /><br />Since I&#039;ve been visiting the SR forums, I&#039;ve posted comments on several threads that I&#039;m no longer interested in, yet any new post causes the thread to show up under &quot;Show new replies to your posts.&quot; Is there a way to unsubscribe to threads one has posted in?<br /><br />Thanks for any help ...

				I&#039;m pretty sure that if you have posted in a thread and want to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; you just click the notify button. I&#039;m going to do that to this thread right now to see if it works....but I guess I won&#039;t know for sure until someone else posts in it.....even then I will have to look for the thread after the next post if it does work ???<br /><br /><br /><br />edit: after you click notify, the notify button turns to unnotify or something to that effect. click unnotify and you shouldn&#039;t see those threads anymore :)

				I&#039;m glad to see I&#039;m not the only one with this interest ...<br /><br />wretched - thank you for your reply. I&#039;m trying your suggestion with this thread, so we&#039;ll see if it works. I did notice that a check box—&quot;Notify me of replies&quot;—shows up underneath the message box, checked. Of course, I&#039;m deselecting the check box.

				ah, I never even saw that box there. but I now KNOW that the notify/unnotify button on the topic does nothing to effect it. I am unticking that box in the other options on this reply...

				yep, your post showed up in my new replies&#039; list, so the notify button idea doesn&#039;t do it. Seems like there must be a way to do this; every other forum I&#039;ve ever been on allowed for this option ...
