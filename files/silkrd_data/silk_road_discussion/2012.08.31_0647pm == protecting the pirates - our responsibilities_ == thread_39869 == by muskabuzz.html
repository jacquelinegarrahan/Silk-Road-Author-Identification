				if you&#039;ve spent even a single day on the silk road, no matter what your reason for being here, you have felt an extraordinary appreciation.&nbsp; perhaps of a type you haven&#039;t felt it in a long time but still, you do know it what it is.&nbsp; it would not be too presumptuous to say we all feel this way, even los feos - reading this now - even you must wonder for one moment - what if my service were dedicated not to a terminally corrupted system but rather to one that holds promise for me being what i know i can be - a brave and unique upholder of some basic freedoms (in this case over nothing more than our most fundamental selves).<br /><br />whoever you are you also must realize that some very valuable humans have won you this moment of&nbsp; freedom we currently share, not only through their unique capabilities but also through something much more ordinary in the course of gaining liberty: the risk of their own lives.&nbsp; we all know that enemies are at hand and also what they are capable of but do many of us realize what it means to defy such resources every day and night of our lives?&nbsp; the muskabuzz are regularly inspired by the intelligence and sensitivity of this community but believe that perhaps not a single one us know what it requires to be a dpr; to not not only endure the dark forces but to look them in the eye unafraid, to evolve with them and surround them on layers they can not see.&nbsp; for this the muskabuzz offer their thanks.<br /><br />even if the rest of us can&#039;t fully appreciate the pirates&#039; situation we do know a few things w/r/t such matter at large. either side can gain the first ground, either side can return the upper hand but only the one&nbsp; based on love and courage can break the cycle.&nbsp; it is in this spirit we feel a responsibility to replicate a very old and vertical meme:&nbsp; one&#039;s own life &lt; another&#039;s liberty.&nbsp; for those requiring a formal proof one may consult any chapter of human history.<br /><br />there are many more skilled and more brave that already know all of this; we feel no responsibility to lead anything, not even this discussion, but we would be remiss if we did not start it. the situation&#039;s nature requires individual action and an infinite number of possibilities are open to every one of us.&nbsp; many of us simply need suggestions or perhaps some help with the math. however there is only 1 zero in this equation and it is our greatest fortune that it defines those that would join the cause of our destruction. for if we simply follow our hearts it is only our opponents that are destined by the crippling indifference resulting from bondage and fear.<br /><br />please share what you can; right here, and in other worlds. you may rely on us to do the same.<br /><br /><br />buggz life, 4th keeper of the muskabuzz

				Well said.&nbsp; I do feel a spiritual sense of pride while supporting this community known as SR.&nbsp; Being able to direct power towards what is good, while facing evil IS empowerment of the people by the people.<br /><br />Love will always win, unfortunately there will be sacrifices.&nbsp; Godspeed to all soldiers of light.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				From the moment I tasted the mighty Fleetwood, I knew there was something quite unique about the muskabuzz product, something beyond simple escape and entheogens. These folks are thinkers and human, I do believe. <br /><br />Excellent awareness...<br /><br />- eb&nbsp; 8)

				Silk Road is definitely a great place and grew out of a great idea.&nbsp; It&#039;s obvious a lot of thought and effort went into the planning. The people behind it, in my opinion are revolutionists and I hope this is just the beginning of a much needed revolution against prohibition.&nbsp; The Road is almost like some sort of social experiment /research project that is showing that legalization can and will work. <br />&nbsp;<br />Prohibition is a farce!!!!!&nbsp; You can&#039;t police peoples morals!!! Prohibition is based on so many lies, that it&#039;s can&#039;t help be anything but a farce. In many cases,&nbsp; the laws initially behind prohibition were based on racism and little else. It had little to do with public safety, unless you believed Chinese, Mexican or African Americans were dangerous simply due to their race.&nbsp; For those that believe the lie that prohibition was enacted to save lives, or to promote the safety of citizens, that&#039;s part of the lie, the myth that is perpetuated. That being that it&#039;s for our own good. No, among many of the racist ideas that pushed prohibition a few were; white citizens in some cities, after reading false stories, believed if black people took cocaine they would rape their children. Another reason, some &quot;upstanding white citizens&quot; wanted the &quot;dirty Chinese&quot; and their opium dens out of their cities. Ironically, it was okay for the white house wife to be a morphine addict though, but Chinese opium addicts were evil and dirty and would addict your children. (The BS stories haven&#039;t changed much have they. Now Mexican drug dealers addict children ::) ) Before prohibition there were many more women dependent on morphine than men. Before prohibition many so called upstanding citizens had opiate habits, but led productive lives. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s great to go out and get a habit (certainly not in this day and age) but it could be managed when it was legal and people could remain productive. They could maintain at a very reasonable price and legally. Very different from now. Now, they&#039;ll have you believe that addicts can&#039;t do anything are just brain dead idiots, or can&#039;t possibly be productive.&nbsp; One of the doctors who founded John Hopkins hospital, William Stewart Halsted was a life long morphine addict and a famous surgeon.&nbsp; In the 1800&#039;s doctors would try to switch hardcore alcoholics to morphine because they believed it wasn&#039;t nearly as bad as alcohol. Try telling a doctor that now. I believe prohibition plays a large part in how drugs affect society now. It&#039;s made things worse!&nbsp; Simply, prohibition has destroyed many more lives than it has saved.&nbsp; All prohibition has accomplished until now is to perpetuate a huge prison population,&nbsp; which in turn is creating a multi billion dollar privatized prison system in the US, as well as promoting a HUGE budget to enforce prohibition. Citizens pay taxes for prohibition to be enforced!! Waste of money! The powers that be don&#039;t want to do away with prohibition for many reasons, but a main one is that so much of the US economy, in a sense, revolves around it.&nbsp; There are a lot of jobs that revolve around prohibition. <br />Okay, I&#039;ll get off my soapbox now.&nbsp; :) The topic of prohibition gets me a little worked up!&nbsp; &gt;:( <br /><br />There&#039;s a famous quote that is attributed to Abraham Lincoln.&nbsp; Although recently there has been a lot of debate as to whether it was he who actually said it, it&#039;s still a great quote.<br /><br />&nbsp; &quot;Prohibition... goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control mans&#039; appetite through legislation and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes... A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our Government was founded.”
