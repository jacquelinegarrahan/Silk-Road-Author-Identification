				I feel like I saw something like this in the forums but can&#039;t find it.&nbsp; I&#039;m just thinking about being out at a club and want to go into the bathroom for a quick hit of coke or the latest 2c-?.&nbsp; I looked on Amazon and saw a few things like really small canisters you can connect to your key chain.&nbsp; I&#039;m scared of those little plastic packets because they don&#039;t seem very sturdy.&nbsp; There&#039;s got to be a place that sells like a cool little &quot;pill box&quot; or something like that?&nbsp; Something just big enough to keep yourself high when you&#039;re out in public.&nbsp;

				the key in clubs is don&#039;t be too out of it or you draw heat and act less cautiously (I do anyway) got busted once and it was very embarrassing and costly but all my fault.<br /><br />Stick to dance clubs, less commercial the better.

				Here&#039;s a good tip: make sure you know where the bathroom is before you do your drug. Me and my friends took some MDMA before going to a rave and it hit faster than usual, so when I inevitably had to use the bathroom later, I was stumbling around outside of the dance room. Some security guy clearly knew that I was on ecstasy because my teeth were chattering and I couldn&#039;t talk. I was very lucky that the guy simply directed me to the bathroom and never said a word about it again. If it had been the wrong guy, I&#039;d have gotten kicked out and possibly the cops would have been called. So be safe, and don&#039;t be completely obvious about the drug use.

				My latest thing is to make up 125MG MDMA caps. Then I take a pack of cigarettes and (with emptying a little tobbacco) they fit snuggly in the tip of a smoke. I can sell pills all night and it just looks like people are bumming smokes off me.
