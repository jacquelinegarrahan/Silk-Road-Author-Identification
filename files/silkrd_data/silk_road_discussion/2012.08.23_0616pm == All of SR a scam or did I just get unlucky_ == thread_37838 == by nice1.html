				I bought a gram of meph - my first order on here - was so happy it came ,looked very professional.<br /><br />Bare in mind I&#039;ve been in this game over 15 years eating drugs, ive seen every quality type trick hustle in the book.<br /><br />I can just buy 3mmc off a google vendor but I wanted 4mmc which has become rare on the streets here.<br /><br /><br />So I order off Thestorystartshere as my first buy and now I&#039;m not sure if I should bother even trying any other vendors here&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />I snorted 100mg - nothing no effect - 100mg of 4MMC has a very pronounced and immediate effect - always, I knew staright away something as wrong.<br /><br />but I then made a rizla bomb with 200mg in it and popped that - this time I got a very mild effect comparaible to maybe 50mg MDMA lasting about 5 minutes then it was over.<br /><br />So I snorted about another 2 x 100mg lines roughly and still minimal to no effect.&nbsp; &nbsp; Really annoyed TBH<br /><br /><br />Why has this guy got all good feedback?&nbsp; Was I just the unlucky one who got ripped off or are people here dumb? or is the feednback system fraudulant?&nbsp; Which is it.<br />Cuz these are the only things I can think of to explain why I can do 800mg of supposed mephedrone and feel less intoxication than I&#039;d get from half a stella.<br /><br /><br />I know meph too, I know most drugs after 15 years in the scene.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ive had banging stuff twice this year and even 50mg gave me good euphoria.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m considering either trying another vendor or just leaving now cuz for the price I paid I expected something that fucking worked.&nbsp; He may as well of sent nothing or a bag of salt.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even know what toxic chem Ive got here that Ive just fuckin consumed&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Sorry but really pissed off

				I wouldn&#039;t even waste your time. Over the past 2 months almost every order I made from a vendor that wasn&#039;t a long time vendor with hundrends of sales and there&#039;s only a hanful of them left. I received shitty product not even worth buying. Using respected vendors really isn&#039;t even safe anymore becuase I&#039;ve been getting burned by them recently as well. Everyone&#039;s quality is going to shit. I&#039;m better off sourcing drugs locally then coming here having to put up with all the bs and still get shitty products. complete waste of time. <br /><br />Vendors up your game you&#039;re all getting pathetic. gonna run everyone off eventually if product isn&#039;t worth 2 shits.<br /><br />

However, your making loads of accusations and haven&#039;t named the vendor/s in question?&nbsp; Can you name the vendor/s so&nbsp; others have the details on which they can then make an informed choice. If your leaving, there is nothing stopping you from outing the questionable vendors for all to see. It is the right thing to do so others won&#039;t be scammed.

				Yeah, I thought I was just getting unlucky because going by the reviews it seems like everyone is getting awesome drugs all the time which just isn&#039;t the case. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a scam or just inexperienced users but I&#039;m just about done with this place.<br />There&#039;s one vendor on here I like to use and that&#039;s pretty much the only thing keeping me around. I&#039;ve left bad reviews in the forum on my buyer account and also left bad reviews in their feedback when I got screwed over, so I&#039;ve done all I can do.<br /><br />I guess the only thing to do is get the word out, eventually people will catch on.

				Put it on the scam thread.This happened to me when I ordered &quot;MDMA&quot; from ggw he had a shit load of reviews and cheap molly so I said what the hell I might as well try it.I ordered it and it looked the part but didn&#039;t smell or taste like molly.I ended up taking the first 150mg and nothing happened.I was disappointed but figured maybe I should just try some more so I snorted an addition 150mg.Nothing.I then took the rest of the &quot;MDMA&quot; and it felt like I drank 5 energy drinks or took a stacker or something for about 10 minutes but no euphoria no &quot;closeness&quot; or feeling connected emotionally connected no happiness no MDMA feelings at all just really jittery and kind of tweaky.It was obviously bunk because I don&#039;t know anyone that doesn&#039;t roll on 500mg of molly.I posted that in his forum thread and instead of people taking my warning about the quality of the MDMA some random asshole accused me of lying about it and being in a conspiracy with a shroom vendor or something.He accused me of having ties with a new vendor who is strictly in the shroom market and that I lied about GGWs molly to like get rid of the competition or something I really don&#039;t know I didn&#039;t understand his reasoning for thinking I was lying but I hope he ordered it and got a bunch of bunk bullshit.But anyway to your original question NO not all vendors are scammers Ive ordered from probably 10-12 different vendors and only received bullshit once.I learned to be smarted about it though.Remember most of the reviews on the vendor page are before any one has tried it and they are just giving the guy his money because he delivered it and its usually a review on the vendor himself for example his speed/professionalism/stealth/ect....If you really want reviews on the product itself then you have to check the forums.After he sent me fake molly Ive never ordered anything without checking the forums first or hearing someones personal experience with the product itself.

				Did you finalize early? You shouldn&#039;t. If you didn&#039;t, did you dispute the order and try to get a refund? Did you leave a bad review for the vendor? Did you use any of the features that the developers of this site designed to protect buyers? If not, then you shouldn&#039;t complain about SR.

This website is for buying and selling drugs after all they aren&#039;t here to just talk to people and be mods I&#039;m sure they are interested in who the scammers are and I&#039;m sure they would be pretty pissed if they were sold bunk bullshit.

There are the odd &quot;I&#039;ve been scammed&quot; threads, yes, but these are mostly from people who fail to do their due diligence by researching vendors and reading up on how to conduct business here BEFORE making their purchase.<br /><br />As it currently stands I have 39 transactions under my belt over the past 10 / 11 months with a value of over $8000 and I&#039;m yet to lose a single cent, or receive any &#039;bunk&#039; products. Follow your gut instinct, never leave the safety of the escrow system unless you&#039;re comfortable with the possibility of losing your money and not being able to enter into resolution in the event of a situation such as the one you found yourself in, and always research your vendors before you buy.<br /><br />It is NOT hard to make successful transactions on here.<br /><br />As for:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ll be teling every one I know on every forum I can about whats going on here.&nbsp; Your a bunch of con artists and thieves.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Go for it. Nobody is forced to be here, and nobody is forced to buy from any vendor. Quite a large number of excellent vendors have entered stealth mode because they were being overwhelmed by new orders, and wanted to keep their quality of service at a high level.<br /><br />Go ahead and tell everyone you know on every forum you can that &#039;everyone on Silk Road is a thief, and everybody there, especially the admins and mods, are in on a conspiracy to rip off new users!&#039; It&#039;s not going to make a blind bit of difference. Sorry to tell you, but you, just like me, are completely insignificant when compared to the scale of the Road. There are enough buyers here to accommodate hundreds more vendors.<br /><br />Try Black Market Reloaded if you want to make some successful transactions, I&#039;m sure the well-renowned completely trustworthy vendors there will be licking licking their lips at the sight of you coming along.<br /><br />Paranoia is part and parcel of this type of business and is to be expected, but you really do need a new tinfoil hat. You had a bad transaction. Chalk it up to experience and be a LOT more careful in future. Never leave escrow, and if you have an issue, discuss it with your vendor. If you get no satisfaction there, take it to resolution. Or just toss all of your toys out of the pram and stomp your feet about it. Nobody really cares.<br /><br />Perhaps approach the issue, and the community, with a modicum of decorum and you might garner a little sympathy. Insulting the users, the vendors, the mods and the SR admins by labeling us &quot;a bunch of con artists and thieves&quot; will earn you nothing but disdain here.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Idk bout the rest of you but I&#039;ve had plenty of good experiences on SR. Only once did I ever have a problem but it was a scammer. All product I&#039;ve ever received is 100% legit. Order from better vendors, use the forums, it&#039;s not that difficult ???

				I once received a sample of LSD that was probably something other. Too much body load for LSD. <br /><br />Though another sample of LSD I got from a European vendor was top notch. Grand trip, that. Too bad that vendor is not around anymore. <br /><br />Received top notch pure crystal MDMA from a vendor. I still have a bit of it. Pure good stuff. Nice white and light brown. Mmmm. <br /><br />Also Davidd is a great RC vendor. Always good stuff. Never an issue. But of the 80 or so orders placed on here, only once did I get bunk product. But the vendor made it right. <br /><br />Shrooms here have been good. Even the encapsulated ones. But nothing beats properly dried shrooms. Rocker&#039;s shrooms in that regard are tops. <br /><br />Twice I had to deal with 2 vendors that didn&#039;t ship. Got refunded by SR support. But didn&#039;t like having to wait for resolution. Not used to bad experiences here. So I get pissy when vendors flak out. <br /><br />Overall, my experiences with SR have been great over these 9 months. Some of the best vendors are gone and I do miss them. It was nice being able to do repeat business. Pharmville was one of my favorites. But there are still many good vendors here that I do repeat business with.

				I researched for almost 2 weeks before buying - I&#039;m not an idiot<br /><br />i searched the forum for his username and it was good reports too then I read every single page of his feedback&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; what else can I do?<br /><br /><br />and yes I left him a 1/5 rating to warn others.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not looking for sympathy - I&#039;m trying to figure out how people selling fake product get all good feedback.&nbsp; I notice the main guy selling coke in EU as well is selling MDPV cut and repressed.&nbsp; If you read his FB theres about 50+ positives but buried in there were 3 reports saying it felt like MDPV.&nbsp; &nbsp;People MUST be faking feedbacks.&nbsp; Probably with false buys to theirself.<br /><br /><br />I ended up doing the whole gram in under 5 hours oraly and nasally and felt nothing beyond placebo effect then went to bed.&nbsp; I got real drone about 3 months ago and 100mg had me hugging trees lol Ive done it 100s of times too so I know what I&#039;m talking about.<br /><br /><br />I may as well open a vendor account and sell flour as top grade coke, since thats what the majority here seem to be doing.&nbsp; So far on the forums Ive been reporting this on ytheres been abot 10 to 1 negative to positve ratio of replies.&nbsp; At these prices whos gonna get scammed 10 times just in the hope of 1 good transaction&nbsp; ::)

				Of all the buys I&#039;ve made on SR and were talking around 30 now (and most are pretty big, 5-30g range) I have only ever had issues with 3, 1 I was refunded, 1 didn&#039;t make it and the other is in res now. Everything else has been great and has never been bunk. <br /><br />And if you want Meph come to me, mine&#039;s the balls.

Problem with Meph is that even if the people who are selling it think it&#039;s legit most of the time it normally isn&#039;t and is either cut to shit or it&#039;s actually just not 4-MMC at all and usually 4-MEC, 4-EMC or a combination of the two. A lot of the vendors don&#039;t even know they are being shafted because they only got into Meph after the ban so they dunno the difference, if they did they&#039;d realize that selling grams of it at silly prices like £10 or £15 pounds just wouldn&#039;t work if it&#039;s the real product because those were the prices when it was LEGAL and now it&#039;s not those prices on a single gram just aren&#039;t feasible. It would be great if they were and I wish it was like it was back in the day but that just isn&#039;t how it is and times change. It&#039;s like how people moan because they want a key for a silly price like £2900 because that&#039;s what it used to be, if that&#039;s what they are paying that shit isn&#039;t real. I sell a key IRL for around £4500 to £5000 for a single (depending on the batch size I&#039;ve done and purity) and that stuff easily sells for £25 a gram and people gladly pay it because it&#039;s legit shit, you only have to see my feedback to see that&#039;s the case. <br /><br />Anyway rant over, just thought I&#039;d shed a little light on the subject. :)

				I agree. Should be called Scammer&#039;s Road, not silk road. <br />I thought you could trust the forum, but you can&#039;t. Some people just come there and advertise scammers all over. In fact, I ordered acid from 2 highly acclaimed vendors there (albion and vitacat). Both were rcs.<br />The only one that did not sell an RC was someone who was not recommended at all.<br /><br />Just go and look at the LSD thread... People are talking complete bullshit on there, and you can&#039;t even find recommendations... I think they&#039;re just trying to get their post count up so they could recommend some scammer...<br /><br />And when I (or anyone else) says they think their acid is shit, you get attacked immediately. You know how the buyer&#039;s guide says don&#039;t be aggressive? Well, if your opinion is that something is not acid, you immediately get jumped and people tell you you&#039;re an asshole.<br /><br />They also tell you to talk it out with the vendor first and not post, as if someone could send an RC by mistake (there is no mistake - they just want to scam other buyers as well).<br /><br />People are saying there that &quot;the bitter taste is from the ink&quot; or &quot;the bitter taste is from the ethanol (or w/e)&quot;... They also say that some guys have the &quot;cleanest acid they ever tried&quot;. What&#039;s clean acid? So I asked someone just that, and he said &quot;it means your fingers don&#039;t fall off&quot;.<br /><br />Now all of this is going on in the LSD discussion thread, RECOMMENDED BY SR.<br /><br />And then when I come and ask on here if this forum has rules I get answers like &quot;don&#039;t piss off lim&quot;. I expected something like &quot;no scammers, no trolls, no abuse&quot; to actually be written somewhere. But I can&#039;t find that, so I can&#039;t really complain about anything, right?<br /><br />BTW, my mistake is that I bought from vendors who have &quot;specials&quot;. They put listing for just one week and then take it off. Huge red flag, but I trusted the advice of the SR forum. Very little good it did me.<br /><br />At this point, I&#039;m not going to trust SR with anything. Before I order again, I&#039;m going to get an ehrlich test, and I&#039;m going to try a quarter tab, and I&#039;m going to make sure that the guy I&#039;m buying from has been up for months.<br />Don&#039;t know if I actually get the time to do that. There are better ways to get drugs.<br />But if I don&#039;t do that, I&#039;m going to die someday on the stuff sold around SR.

				Yeah this is exactly how I feel about the Meph scene because it saddens me that people really think that&#039;s the real deal when it quite simply is not. Only the people who were on it back in the day know the shit from the chocolate. <br /><br />Anyway in summary mate if you want REAL Meph come to me and I&#039;ll see you right. Currently I have powder at the moment but my new rice-crystal will be landing soon and it is the real old-school pre ban quality. The powder I have is good but it&#039;s maybe 1/3rd of a step down from pre-ban but it&#039;s definitely very high quality. It&#039;s just that the isomers aren&#039;t quite the same as pre-ban but the new batch is 100% back too ya roots quality. :)

The only drug I can think of that would be the exception is C because of how lucrative it is. Personally I don&#039;t like how vendors get around the escrow system like that. Imho, stay in escrow, and only give a refund if there&#039;s a seizure letter, if the mailman took it, that sucks, but it would prevent vendors from requiring FE and less scams would be present...I think

You had a few bad experiences so wanna slag off an entire community of hard working vendors who go out of their way to offer high quality drugs and a higher quality customer experience ?<br /><br />The admins do not modify anything, if, in the chance you HAVE been shafted by a bad decision, then don&#039;t forget the admins deal with hundreds of not thousands of complaints, so who are they gonna side with, the person who has had a lot of successful business or the new buyer which fits the profile of every scammer to come along trying to score free drugs ?<br /><br />You need to vent over being scammed then that&#039;s fine, but you come on here and rip the entire community because of a bad experience, then just fuck off and don&#039;t come back.<br />

It, and we, represent freedom of choice. Freedom from oppression. Freedom over our own bodies and minds. And perhaps in time, this site right here will be looked back on as the catalyst that will eventually bring about the end of government control and intrusion into our daily lives.<br />DPR founded this place, and he / she did so with an Agrorist mindset. A free market, freedom of choice, and freedom of expression. Sure, it&#039;s also a self-financing enterprise, but we currently live in a capitalist society and it&#039;s only right and fair that it&#039;s creator / creators get to benefit financially from it.<br /><br />You also state:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t get the &quot;you didn&#039;t do enough research, your fault&quot; approach...<br />If you want to attract more people, you need to make it easier on them to buy, not harder...<br /><br />Remember that the more users there are here, the cheaper drugs can be, and less likely that you get arrested...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This isn&#039;t Amazon or eBay. Apart from being an incubator of rebellion, it&#039;s also an underground drug market. There are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people who regularly purchase here without needing someone to hold their hand. If you&#039;re not responsible and mature enough to take the time to research before you buy, it IS your fault.<br />Who said anything about wanting to attract more people? There are already enough people to keep vendors busy, and a large number of excellent vendors are so busy that they now conduct their business in Stealth Mode with regular customers.<br /><br />More users = cheaper drugs is a fallacy. Prices are generally dictated by virtue of supply and demand. The higher the supply (i.e. the larger number of vendors offering the same product), the lower the price as they compete for business. The lower the supply (i.e. the lower the number of vendors offering the same product), the higher the demand ON that supply. The lower the supply and the higher the demand, the higher the price that&nbsp; vendors can charge for the product. You clearly have no idea about the basic rules of economics.&nbsp; :-X

				First off I&#039;m new and I don&#039;t know if I will ever use SR&#039;s sevices just trying to get a feel of the site and reading feedbacks and shit.&nbsp; For the better part of 15yrs I was in or around the game, but had to get out because the love of my life gave me 2 choices marry her, or make money I chose a bright future.<br /><br />I still use opiates but I just hate fucking dealing with that shady ass world. About 5 yrs ago I needed to make a buisness trip to SoCal to Re-Up. So I made my &quot;long mother fucking drive&quot; to go pick up cuz I wouldn&#039;t even trust my own mom being a mule. Everything was set I was getting 6lbs of &quot;go fast&quot; at $9500 per tupperware container lb per if u homies dont know. I dealt with dood a few times and shit was alwaays GREAT got my shit and split 4000 miles in 2 days aint no fun,lmfao,<br /><br />I make it home just like I always did YOU FEEL LIKE A FUCKING KING AFTER RUNS LIKE THAT.Left everything in my rental car, I needed sleep, so in the morning I start weighing everything out and notice the 1st is light by 2 oz the 2nd was the same, looking at em all I said fuck they are all light I was missing almost a whole P and fucking pissed. I call dood and he said thats how he got em what I knew was fucking bullshit but what can you do call the cops, I just had to chalk it up to xp. I just said to myself fuck it if I could have bought in my city for 15000 a P so I guess It was still a deal even though I was shy almost 16oz

Some people can&#039;t afford shit, choose to spend what little money that have on drugs, and when they get scammed of course they&#039;ll complain about it. Human nature.<br /><br />You&#039;re right though, big spenders have more to complain about when they get scammed or ripped off.

				Now, now tunebear. <br /><br />We&#039;re all addicts to one degree or another. Nature of the beast. Besides, life is hard. So if those with less coin to spare spend it on a way to escape, hey, who are we to judge?<br /><br />Getting cheated sucks monkey balls. I&#039;ve always stayed in escrow. So the only thing I ever lost was time... waiting for resolution to go live. <br /><br />Anyway, I feel sorry for those who get stiffed. It breaks down confidence in this place. Even when you stay in escrow, you still take a chance in one way or another. Especially if you &quot;need&quot; what you just bought. Luckily, I&#039;ve never had a weekend ruined. When it&#039;s that critical, I order from more than one vendor. <br /><br />That, and I keep a small stock just in case. ;)

				Hmm just been reading over this thread and it all seems a bit odd. I purchased meph from TSSH when he first started up, and what i received was 4MMC. I wouldn&#039;t say the effects were on par with pre-ban (lacked some euphoria and didn&#039;t last as long), but it was 4MMC for sure. Nothing compared to limetless&#039; 4MMC, though. That shit is the bomb. <br />So maybe TSSH is a selective scammer, I.e sending out bunk product to new, unestablished buyers. In hope they would just leave and not make a deal about it. I don&#039;t know though, you can never be sure with this site. <br />But I&#039;ve had 10/10 successful transactions and only ever had one problem with delivery where a vender forgot to stamp the package lol.<br />my suggestion is buy 4MMC from limetless or googleyed.

				From reading this It&#039;s quite clear that the vendor did not know about this particular incident. before you left negative feedback, you should contact the seller ( It&#039;s pretty clear to me that you are not happy with the product you received, If I was the vendor who supplied you with unsatisfying M-CAT I would refund. End of ) <br />If you still leave negative feedback after refund, that is going to anoy most vendors and some aren&#039;t as nice as me. I wouldn&#039;t <br />want a vendor unhappy with me when they have name and address<br /><br />Like i say most vendors are really nice, understanding people<br />unfortunately these are vendors scammer buyers target.&nbsp; <br /><br />example here : If you made an order with us. and You order 4mcc (MCAT) titled High Quality - If you believe that product we send you is not High Quality. you should contact us straight away, Don&#039;t just think that&#039;s the end of it, We aim for a 100% satisfaction and if that means refunding you or reshipping an Item, We will <br />( this does NOT mean in anyway that scammers are welcome to order, we know who you are. )<br /><br />On a more positive note though: <br />There&#039;s a lot of serious buyers here,&nbsp; and so it seems you all spend time here in the forums more than most.<br /><br />We are here for a few reasons really, mainly to promote ourselves. How ever we also hope all you Highly ranked members here check us out, We have a few things for sale. <br /><br />Maybe someday, Worldwide Providers will be highly ranked here in the forums too ( that is what we really want ) So we offer Help &amp; Support free on the forums. <br /><br />WWProviders, We want to be the best, We want to be here longer than anyone. Maybe hand down the family business some-day lol <br />We&#039;re never leaving. We mean it when we say &quot; You&#039;ll be seeing us around &quot; <br /><br />Best Regards<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				If you received fake product, but managed to get a refund from the vendor. You should still leave negative feedback but in it state that you got a refund.<br />If the vendor is upset with that then he should have just sent out real product to start with. You can make enough money sending out real product.

				Yes that is a point mju7. If you are not happy with the quality you should show this through feedback. Nobody should send anything that is not how it is described. This is exactly what feedback is for - We all agree here At WWProvider&#039;s that If we are happy with an order we receive, we leave 5/5 .If where not happy we talk to our seller, If the seller cares about his/her reputation and customer satisfaction like we do, They will try their best to make things right. <br /><br />Unfortunately it is a constant worry that people will take advantage of that and leave bad feedback even though they probably like and consumed the product. <br /><br />We are honest, trustworthy people that dedicate ourselves to this line of work. Tax free work ;] We love It here &amp; Hope you do to<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame to be apart of this post :[ We Leave now ;] <br /><br />Best Regards - Check us out If you have the time, our vendor link is in our signature Below.. <br /><br />WWP

				I don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />I have been satisfied with all my orders so far.&nbsp; I have made about 10 transactions so far.<br /><br />Compare that to the ONE recent transaction I made in real life last week.&nbsp; Robbed at gunpoint of 200 dollars when I questioned the pills I was looking at.&nbsp; They left me the bottle.&nbsp; I was given topamax instead of roxies.&nbsp; I had nightmares about them finding my house and killing me for weeks.&nbsp; I would rather take my chances at being scammed (minimal if escrow is followed) over being shot to death any day of the week.<br /><br />Silk Road wins.
