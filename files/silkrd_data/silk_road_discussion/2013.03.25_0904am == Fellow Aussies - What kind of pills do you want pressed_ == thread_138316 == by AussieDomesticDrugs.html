				So we have a guy who, once a month, will press up whatever we give him into whatever kind of pills we want. We thought we&#039;d post here and get some input into what kind of pills you guys want to buy. For our first run we had some 100mg Red Nazi&#039;s made, which have already almost all sold out. We plan to keep making these in the future, but we also want to make a variety of different pills available on our product list as well.<br /><br />So I ask you guys on the forum, what do you want us to make and what kind of dosages do you want us to use? We can add things like Ketamine, Mephedrone and Caffeine in the pills as well if you guys want, so please be specific in exactly what you&#039;d like to see in your tablets, and if it seems like it will be popular enough, we will make them for you!

				Heres a wacky idea... <br /><br />It know it will sound a little bit crazy to the local pill pressers and all but here goes..<br /><br />How about pressing a pill that is just straight MDMA and a non-active binder.. <br />Maybe around 130-150ish mg of Dutch MDMA and fuck all else in it..<br /><br />No mixing it with Ketamine, Caffeine, BZP, Bathsalts or that Pipez shit..<br /><br />Just a nice simple pressed strong hard ECSTASY pill..<br /><br />I know this will never happen in oz but dreams are free..

They don&#039;t flow through the machine so you have to disconnect the hopper, scoop the MDMA into the die and hand-crank them one by one but they come out looking great and don&#039;t crumble.<br /><br />I actually have 2 of them left still, they weigh about 3.5 points each and are basically rocks of pure MDMA in the shape of the Nazi pills. I was planning to list them tomorrow.<br /><br />The quality of local pills lately has been fucking terrible after the Beige Choppers we used to have, so instead of waiting for the Bikies to sort their shit and start making decent rounds again out we decided to figure the whole thing out our-selves and bring them straight to Silk Road, cutting out the middle man entirely. It took about 2 months of work but we have finally got everything set up and underway, and will be able to bring you guys specially pressed pills at least once a month. It&#039;s more profitable for us, and it&#039;s better for you guys as well because you get good pills, win/win in our book :)<br /><br />Some people have messaged me suggesting bk-MDMA and 2-cb as extra ingredients we should include, if people really want we can source both these chemicals pretty easily. What we are thinking at the moment also is getting hold of some MDA so we can make pills with a mix of MDMA and MDA, and we might do some pills with MDMA and Amphetamine as well, as some people like this combination. All our pills will be clearly labelled with their exact contents so people know what they are putting in their mouths.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138316.msg937267#msg937267">Quote from: 1mIcedout on March 25, 2013, 04:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just had a quick look and I cant see any pill listings on his page.

Feedback should be up soon :)

				Good on you man..<br /><br />I did not mean to be too critical of your post. It just didnt have the facts you have now cleared up..<br /><br />I think if you clearly state what is in a pill and can put together some nice clean strong MDMA pills you could do very well indeed..<br /><br />I for one will buy a few to sample and see whats up..<br /><br />Cheers

				This is a bit of a pipe dream, and I realise there will never be enough demand for it unless you decide to ship internationally(I dare say it&#039;d be the only thing O/S customers would buy from an Aus vendor so you get some fame that way ;)) but:<br />-150mg Harmaline<br />-50mg DMT<br /><br />Pressed Ayahuascha pills.... :o

				Cut the amount of methamphetamine in half at least.&nbsp; Whilst MDMA is not neurotoxic in recreational dosages,(contrary to popular opinion) MDMA + Methamphetamine is.<br /><br />Although I&#039;m no pharmacologist, I believe there is a possibility of serotonin storm from that combination too.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to find some references.

That sounds like an extremely strong combination though! Maybe it might be smarter to cut the doses of either the MDMA or Meth, so people can eat one and be fucked up, and then eat another one if they want to be super fucked up. I don&#039;t want to make pills that are gonna hurt people if they take 2, and some people are always going to be a bit irresponsible!

There is no doubt that the pills of yesteryear were so strong and intense compared to the rubbish around today. White Ferrari&#039;s, Camels and Red Doves are a few which hold some very fond memories for me. I&#039;ll never forget the way the music would enter your body as you proceeded to walk into the club. As you looked around for some pretty ladies, the MDMA would unleash a tidal wave of euphoric bliss, leaving me feeling so fucking amazingly good, it&#039;s almost hard to express with words. Suddenly, this pure MDMA I swallowed about 1/2 an hour earlier decided to kidnap my mind for hours on end, the euphoria was so high that you immediately had thoughts of being everything to everyone at the drop of a hat where nothing was going to be too much trouble to accomplish. 10ft tall and bulletproof! I could chat to anyone about anything (or so I thought at the time) and at times was so high, I&#039;d be chatting up a lady, go to the bar to buy some drinks and walk back to someone completely different, hand them the drink I just bought and begin a conversation, totally unaware that the lady I was now talking to was a different person altogether. A mate would let me know at some stage but at the time, I literally couldn&#039;t even remember what the first chick looked like, let alone her name. :P This occasionally happened to me when I kicked off a night out by double dropping my first two in preparation of a big one. Looking back it was very silly of me as I didn&#039;t have the ability to enjoy the night and all it had to offer. ??? I did enjoy myself at the time, although from a planet far, far away from where I actually was supposed to be. ??? Reminiscing is a wonderful feeling, especially when you start clocking up some big numbers and the memories begin to fade a little :D.

MAOIS are potentially dangerous, especially if combined with say an MDMA pill for example.&nbsp; You can&#039;t have people running around on aya at festivals and possibly killing themselves with dangerous combinations. Not to mention aya is not really recreational,&nbsp; you are supposed to (although many don&#039;t) fast for at least 6 hours before hand and actually treat the whole event like a ceremony rather than a day/night out.&nbsp; I could go on for hours, do some research....<br /><br /><br />As for pills were much better in the late 80s (for the minority that even got try them then) and 90s, I used to think like you guys,&nbsp; but I&#039;m not convinced anymore.&nbsp; I think the honeymoon period/age - lack of responsiblity/ and general innocence has a lot to do with it.&nbsp; Having had 200mg+ of kick ass pure crystal made using both the main synthesis techniques and still not finding it as excellent as a green elephant, mitsubishi, dove etc makes me lean more towards the honeymoon thing.<br /><br />I have thought about this for years, I wish someone could properly prove it one way or another.

				Interesting to get some insight from oldschool pill poppers. I know i&#039;ve had some belter nights on flocks/defqons but i have never take more than half of one at once, only halves. Just experiencing absolute bliss with the music talking shit to everyone who made eye contact with.<br /><br />One thing i&#039;ve always wanted to know is what was in those famous Red Mitshus doin the rounds back in the late 90&#039;s. I&#039;ve heard so many positive stories about how great they were yet people were dying from them? I would love to see a lab result for them to compare with flocks and see exactly wtf else was in them. I know a few people who had the green ones and they always speak fondly of them.

				I took my first E in the mid 90&#039;s on a first date on Halloween... It started to kick in during the Halloween Parade which we were a part of... He then took me to a hardcore B n D club (where everyone was apparently more dressed up than normal ?!?!). <br /><br />It was a mad den of inequity, and a frighteningly horrid, yet somehow a beautiful sanctuary. Guys were tied to tables being jabbed with soldering irons - and spanked on racks till they wept and freely bled.

That combination would send most people into overstimulation / panic mode. And that combination in a pill will surely cost $120+

In the UK we were fighting against the systems of coercion and control that keeps the workforce compliant and sober. They even brought in legislation that made congregating in groups and listening to repetitive beats against the law!! we said fuck that and fuck you and went for it as did millions of others who rejected the established norms and redefined clubbing and drug taking not just in the UK but globally.<br /><br />Good times and yes jnemonic a time machine would be fucking epic! any listed on SR?&nbsp; :P
