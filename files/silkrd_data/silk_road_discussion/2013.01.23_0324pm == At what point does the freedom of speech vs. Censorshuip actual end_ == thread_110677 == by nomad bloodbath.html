				There&#039;s nothing wrong with censoring ass hats. Good moderation is required to maintain a healthy community. AskScience is considered one of the best subreddits on reddit precisely because the mods are ruthless in deleting off topic posts, jokes, memes, etc. Now,&nbsp; you don&#039;t have to go that far, because this community engages in a wider range of discussions, but a good line to draw is, &quot;is this person annoying the piss out of everyone?&quot;<br /><br />BTW, as I said in the other thread, freedom of speech is a right granted by a government not to interfere with your expression. It doesn&#039;t mean ass hats can use someone else&#039;s property to spout off. There&#039;s an old saying that freedom of speech belongs to him who can afford a printing press.<br /><br />Or in this case, a server.

				The new forum does have a lot of spam from people trying to reach 50 posts, I agree, but in a sense, I think that&#039;s better than the btkoin and virwex and bitcointalks spam because at least the people trying to get to 50 posts aren&#039;t scamming people out of their money.&nbsp; So it&#039;s definitely a step in the right direction, though I don&#039;t think it would hurt to put a limit on how many times new members can post in an hour or something.

				I don&#039;t like censorship. If one is offended by a post can&#039;t they simply ignore it and move on? Take joywind, for instance... I just started skipping right over his posts. I don&#039;t agree with anything he has to say but I don&#039;t care if he posts it. Usually he gets ripped apart, but the worst that can happen is he gets ignored. <br /><br />It&#039;s actually easy for me to ignore spam,too. Annoying, yes. It clutters up the forum and I&#039;m sure I miss some good threads bc of it, but i guess freedom of speech (especially in a place like this) should prevail in my opinion.<br />

				I believe if a member produces nothing but trash posts for every post then that member should lose the privilege of posting.For all account that equals a spam account. It spams trash and at the desecration of the Forum Staff members can be removed.<br /><br />I mean what good is a post with say,&nbsp; just a ~ symbol? That&#039;s not a form of speech it&#039;s a waste of space.It&#039;s not censorship it&#039;s cleaning house.<br />

				I would say the goal should be primarily to censor obvious trolls along with spam/scam posts.<br /><br />As far as what constitutes trolling, I&#039;d paraphrase the Potter-Stewart definition of pornography: you know it when you see it.

				My humble opinion is this:<br /><br />This is a *silk road forum*&nbsp; I think posts should be about what 99% of the people here want to read.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t a opinion post,&nbsp; it isn&#039;t a favorite food post,&nbsp; so what should a mod&#039;s job be?&nbsp; &nbsp;It should represent the majority.&nbsp; &nbsp; It isn&#039;t about someone taking away your free speech.<br /><br />Think of it as a school, where most of the students are trying to learn, and there is that *one guy* who insists on cutting up and bullying others.&nbsp; &nbsp;It simply cannot be allowed.<br /><br />The purpose of Sr is for people to get medicine or recreational drugs of their choice.&nbsp; A wonderful freedom, that some people can&#039;t find on the street.&nbsp; The purpose of this forum is to assist people on the journey down that road, to make it as smooth as possible, and protect members from scams.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This is not a platform to debate if you should post about other ethnic groups, or bash other members.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Now, all that being said,&nbsp; nobody is over moderating here.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mod&#039;s delete spam, and try to keep things running smooth as possible, so&nbsp; I say, yes, ban someone for posting hate speech, ban someone for spamming,&nbsp; this is not the place for that.&nbsp; &nbsp; We are all adults,&nbsp; everyone should act like it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nobody want&#039;s to censor your thoughts or questions about Sr,&nbsp; heck there is even a *off topic* thread for any general ramblings someone may have.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let&#039;s all try and get along, we all dislike spam,&nbsp; we all dislike seeing nothing but fights and finger pointing threads.&nbsp; &nbsp;We all want&nbsp; everyone to be happy and safe.&nbsp; We are all equal.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*one love*

				Personally I think only the people who show zero interest in posting anything other than spam/BS/trolling should get the hammer. I don&#039;t mind the occasional bull shit post, but when all someone does is spread crap, that&#039;s when a mod should step and have words with the offender.<br /><br />And honestly, I&#039;ve seen that happen pretty regularly, so I&#039;m pretty content tbh. The couple of times where I&#039;ve wanted to ban or thumb someone with the censor stick myself, I&#039;ve seen one or another mod step in and cool things down. So I think you guys are managing that balancing act pretty well so far.

				Personally given this isn&#039;t irl, this is a hosted server I would consider majority rules as an rough approximation of where that line should be. If someone is posting deliberately inflammatory stuff for no other purpose than trolling I don&#039;t see why the broader community should have to put up with it but it&#039;s clear some people feel very strongly that they have the right to post anything they please no matter what.<br /><br />Look I get it, I know as an individual you choose to take offense and no one offends you... and if you take offense then whose fault is that? in reality no one but yourself but there has to be some boundaries on here otherwise things can get out of hand. There are many topics that could be considered highly offensive to some and not to others, it&#039;s not a black and white situation so from a mods perspective I don&#039;t have an agenda of my own, I&#039;m just thinking about the good of the broader community.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is supposed to primarily be a dark net drug site where buyers and vendors come together to discuss their business, it is not necessarily a platform for whatever topic you so choose to post on and those who cry foul when they have their wings clipped slightly are just demonstrating their immaturity and lack of understanding/empathy for others.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have a couple thoguhts. Firstly, it seems to me that a lot of threads particularly on the sr discussion forum could be better placed in one of the other sub-forums. Threads that involve petty trolling and name-calling wars between... whoever... and threads like &quot;hey man, whats the strongest weed youve ever toked. I would also include threads with topics like asking for tips on selling pot to your college pals.. it&#039;s not relevant to the silk road. If you want to post some shit about how the FBI controls the silk road and Obama is preparing a weapons ban so that the DEA can commence busting everyone so we need our tinfoil hats... please put it in the security forum if nothing else ::)&nbsp; &nbsp;This would at least keep the main board on track.<br />Secondly, the mods seem to do a pretty good job of balancing it all out already. I think that in most cases the offending posters are pretty obviously over the line when the mods step in. I&#039;m usually relieved anyhow when the trolls are slain. this is not a free country, this is a free enterprise.. We don&#039;t have a first amendment right to be ignorant annoying assholes... Especially assholes who are trying to flame the very people who make the damn community possible in the first place!<br />If you don&#039;t like it go start your own revolution.<br /><br />

				The 1st Amendment allows us to express ourselves without interference by or from the federal government.&nbsp; The 1st Amendment does not apply to private property so the line is where you and DPR say the line is, eh?<br /><br />I have never really been offended by anything here, I have some of our crazier cousins on &#039;ignore&#039; and there are some threads I don&#039;t even bother to open.&nbsp; Having said that, I will admit to feeling a bit stung (kind of like an involuntary shudder) when ppl start throwing around the N word and the J word - when they are doing it just to be hurtful and just to inflame.&nbsp; That, according to the Registration Agreement we all signed-off on, is a violation of forum rules.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is the Agreement, please note the first paragraph:<br /><br />You agree, through your use of this forum, that you will not post any material which is false, defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person&#039;s privacy or adult material.

When I see these morons making these threads then giving up to the minute updates on the number of confirmations, I can only hope that the SR crew will deliberately make those impatient spammers wait as long as possible or even &quot;lose&quot; their coins. IRL being an impatient nuisance with drug dealers gets you one thing - BURNED cuz your a fucking annoying pussy who PISSES people off.<br /><br />Any and all pointless &quot;spam&quot; posts made solely to get the post count up - PLEASE DELETE! The post count was somewhat useful in gauging how long the person had been participating in the forums and I used to look at people&#039;s post count/negative karma ratio as a vague indicator of how much non-stupid stuff they had to say. Sadly that changed with the &quot;spam 50 posts to newbie forum before posting elsewhere&quot; rule.<br /><br />Any new threads asking how to use PGP - PLEASE DELETE! (if anything these questions should be posted as replies in the big PGP threads - or god forbid using the search engine to find the question has already been answered many times).<br /><br />Political discussions and posts can be deleted at will. Personally I think it&#039;s an unnecessary risk to discuss personal political beliefs on this forum, since that may give clues to your real identity and help the narcoswine with their profiling.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />All these are good. Also any posts that are directly flaming, especially in a very long, drawn out argument.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Agreed! Also stray cat&#039;s post is good, especially in the context of some of the more immature users who use offensive slurs and whatnot because they are on an anonymous forum and so feel free to say all the words their mommy won&#039;t let them say at dinner.

I never said because we are allowed to buy drugs here that hate speech is dignified, how do the two even correlate? lol<br /><br />If you want an example of legitimate censorship I&#039;m sad you even have to ask, it took me about 100 posts to finally reach 50, but how about reading my first post if you want to rant with such omniscience. It was posted before these restrictive (censoring duh) new rules and it went a little exactly like this:<br /><br /><br />Hi guys, just thought I would register so I could thank the people who suggested exit through the gift shop and the truth about Gaddafi, both excellent docos.<br /><br />One of my fave docos is called You&#039;re Gonna Miss Me, which is based on the life of psychedelic rock pioneer Roky Erickson. Although I&#039;m obviously a big fan of Roky, this doco is quality and great for anyone regardless of what you think of his music, Roky has led an interesting life to say the least.<br /><br />From wiki:<br />You&#039;re Gonna Miss Me is an American documentary film by Keven McAlester. It focuses on Roky Erickson, the former frontman for the band The 13th Floor Elevators. The band is cited as pioneers of the psychedelic rock sound. The film covers Erickson&#039;s rise to rock-and-roll icon status, his overuse of LSD, struggles with schizophrenia, and his 1969 marijuana arrest that led to stays at Austin State Hospital and Rusk State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.<br /><br />I can&#039;t find a free link atm but I&#039;m sure it has to be somewhere on the net. <br /><br /><br />^^^ Not exactly hate speech is it now? Nevertheless I was then CENSORED by not being allowed to post at all except for some newbie page filled with crap, as would be expected with such a silly premise. I could not even respond to a guy who had replied to me in that thread. <br /><br />Don&#039;t reply to me, I have said all I needed to say on the subject of censorship and to be honest when I joined here in 2011 I never thought I would have to. This forum has become infested with people who agree with censorship and have no idea what the counterculture is or what it stands for, that is why these forums have died not because a couple of newbies were asking about pgp. If you do respond then my answer in advance is &#039;k&#039;, k?<br /><br />

[SNIP]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m afraid I have to agree with our protesting chum here. Censorship is detrimental in the extreme to the ultimate goal we are all screaming out for: freedom. I understand that certain things do need to be contained, but there are far too many new members here who are all too happy to turn to censorship in order to &#039;make this a better place&#039;. In other words, to make it more familiar. When faced with dizzying amounts of freedom, something that is unattainable in one&#039;s daily life, one reaches out for the nearest thing that seems familiar - in this case, that is &#039;control&#039;.<br /><br />These members desire more moderators, and indeed, many volunteer themselves for the role without understanding the implications that granting moderator privileges to every Tom, Dick and Harry would have on an anonymous, open forum such as this. DPR picks his/her moderators very carefully, and the moderators we do currently have do an excellent job toeing the line between moderating and ensuring the freedoms that DPR has envisioned.<br /><br />I&#039;ve explained in the past the reasons that we need LESS moderators, not more; I&#039;m not going to rehash my previous argument here but censorship and large scale moderation goes against the spirit of Silk Road, the spirit of the community and the intentions of DPR when setting up the marketplace and separating the forums from the marketplace itself. Censorship is downright dangerous.<br /><br />DPR&#039;s interest lies around an Agorism based marketplace, with libertarian ideals at its core. These forums, as an outlet of (free) expression, must not be allowed the taste of censorship. If that occurs then it will be clear that we have abandoned the principles that guide this community; and when we abandon those principles, we lose all value that we place on our freedom.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Moderators are in a no-win situation when it comes to these matters -- if we lock threads that are racist/offensive/etc. then people get angry ... but if we don&#039;t lock those threads, people get angry.&nbsp; It&#039;s a daily struggle to determine what, if anything, should be deleted or locked.&nbsp; The only threads I&#039;ve deleted are the threads of the virwex / bitcointalks spammers.&nbsp; It&#039;s a difficult line to walk, but I know that I - and the other moderators - do the best we can to promote and allow freedom of speech while also keeping in mind that there are instances in which leaving a thread open becomes detrimental to the community.&nbsp; It&#039;s a balancing act.&nbsp; We don&#039;t always succeed in keeping everyone happy, but we&#039;re all trying to do the right thing in these situations.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve noticed it, but when I try to provide &quot;proof&quot; to the admins, it never shows up.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; But, yes, I&#039;ve seen it and reported it -- I know DPR is busy so it may just take awhile to get it fixed.

Freedom of speech is, by its very definition, unshackled. If it offends someone, then that person needs to harden their sensibilities.<br />Where is the justice in silencing one person simply to allow another to enjoy that silence, or to censor a person so as another won&#039;t be offended? Offense is something we **choose** to partake in. Things only become offensive when a person wishes to push their views on another by refusing to accept that they are entitled to their own point of view.<br /><br />We can all agree that it&#039;s incredible to be part of a community where people with sometimes opposing philosophies can co-exist; what makes that all possible, however, is freedom of expression.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />- grahamgreene

This post is to point out that it&#039;s not okay to slam people and then say &quot;it&#039;s SR so I can do what I want&quot;. And for those that do actually say something in a mod&#039;s defense, they are entitled to have that say without being censored. If somebody says fuck you and you let it slide, why would you spill your nut juice over someone saying something NICE? Yeah whatever.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.<br /><br />[Edit. If someone says this is hi-jacking or not related to thread they&#039;ve misunderstood it. Open to FB just don&#039;t be a dick.]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I&#039;d like to thank Roky Erickson one last time for reminding me that I prefer to be a free thinker at whatever it costs and before I go outside to play in the street and whatever randomly pops in my head to do also commend him on his use of censorship with the constant rhetoric using free speech to attempt to enforce and brain wash those in the community that do not conform to his opinion and example this forums members should be following with his overpowering post stylings and name calling to define or dismiss the perfect example of what every member should use as it&#039;s daily guideline for use of this cultural stepping stone to this community&#039;s future survival.<br /><br /><br />Everyone have fun and a good day I&#039;m done with the forums until later this week.<br />Everyone remember to be safeful and stay safe.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad
