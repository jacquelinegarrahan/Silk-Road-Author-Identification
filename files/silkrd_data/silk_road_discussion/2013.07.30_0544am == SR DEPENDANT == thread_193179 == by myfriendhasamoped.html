				As I approach my 6 month anniversary of becoming an active member of SR(+6moths lurking) I realize how much this place means to me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve replaced all my shady local dealers with reliable SRvendors and only do local deals out of respect for dealers who have become friends over the years.&nbsp; &nbsp; I really want to shut them out completely. I realize this makes me a bastard of sorts, but I just want to keep on keeping on...if you know what I mean.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just hope SR keeps going on forever and ever.(please excuse the 20+ beers I&#039;ve drank tonight).&nbsp; I LOVE YOU SR!!!!

				I like the choice on SR. IRL I am lucky to know a few people who are honest traders and have been since the off. Dealers who rip off customers don&#039;t tend to have a loyal customer base. Most dealers IRL will be buddies with undercover cops without even thinking about it. Cops are good at undercover and will live in an area and gradually get connected to the higher ups in the chain. Many drug dealers are not really that clever. IRL its basically about violence. Whoever wins gets the right to supply an areas dealers. That said, there are so many people selling something that there is no 100% territory. Main danger is &#039;rip and run&#039; and I know dealers who have been tied up and asked to donate their profits to lunatics who prey on the drug trade due to being illegal.<br /><br />SR has no violence. Traders here compete in a market which leads to higher quality drugs. That means less health risks as the main danger in drugs is people overdosing due to their supply being a rollercoaster or percentages. Heroin is a bastard for that. Glad I don&#039;t use and I know those who do are forever wondering how strong it actually is. <br /><br />Most drugs sold here, I could source IRL or even the clearnet, but SR is more secure.<br /><br />I admit the quality here is more predictable due to feedback.<br /><br />After all, asking a dealer if there coke is good is pointless. No dealer will ever say &#039;its shit gear&#039;. Buyers give a more honest answer. That said, you have some drugs which many have never used in a pure form. This is why the forums are so important. Certain members here, I would buy on their word alone. <br /><br />As buyers, we have no reason to be dishonest unless your a shill for some vendor. Its easy to see the honest buyers on here.<br /><br />We buy!<br /><br />We give our opinion of the quality and even better use science to tellus the quality (home test purity kits avaliable for almost anyt drug)<br /><br />I admit, work would be dull without SR. I spend half my working day sometimes (and nights) just browsing here and elsewhere.<br /><br />I like informed opinions.<br /><br />And its refreshing to not have the anti drug brigade crying as usual whilst popping prozac, drinking themselves to death and smoking drugs which have no real high!

				i fear for SR too, as more and more main stream media groups are starting to point attention to SR, in the UK, the telegraph recently did one, and i have noticed one thing they mention all the time is pedophilia, they say it in a way as if everyone on the darknet is a junkie getting high over drugs while indulging in pictures of little children, how they try to tar us all with same brush as if we are all pedo&#039;s, its sickening that they do this, yes pedophilia is a problem in the darknet no doubt but its all over the clear net too and the vast majority of people on the darknet are against such disgusting and vile things .. it makes me angry because a person reading the articles that these so called trustworthy media groups are writing, will think we&#039;re all pedos.

				Good bud, good prices, honest vendors. What more do I need? (Besides the money I am waiting for, but its time well spent learning.)<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t be happier, feel safer, and I owe that to all the vendors and the buyers who post here.<br /><br />Thanks everybody for helping n00bs.

I can get equal or better buds for cheaper in my area, but I know there are plenty of places that import their smoke from Cali and it&#039;s the trafficking that brings the price up so much! In peak harvest season, someone could buy top shelf buds for 1k per lb at the source, as low as $500 for b grade, then take it to the east coast and sell it for 5k, but think about the gas, travel time, and HUGE risk involved in driving weed across the country.<br /><br />Other drugs are a different story though, I will never again buy coke IRL, it&#039;s impossible to find something that meets my high standards so I pay the crazy prices on here for quality. I buy only things I can&#039;t find or don&#039;t like the local quality of, but there are only 2 things that fit into that category that I mess with.... I guess that&#039;s why I&#039;m a seller and not a buyer! And FYI, I&#039;m looking into expanding my drug listings once I can track down bulk quality supplies. Expect to see keef, mushrooms, edibles, flowers, pressed hash, and LSD in the near future!

				I&#039;m soon to be SR dependent. Without revealing my location, let me just say I am near two legal states but my state is run by money grubbing bastards. So far their stance on weed is no tolerance. Meanwhile the prisons fill up with people on possession charges. I expect this to change eventually even thought the state makes mad money charging people with pot possession felonies.<br />I really do need the stealth SR provides anyway. (Legal hassle) Not to mention we are a bit more direct to the source if not from the source.<br /><br />I bought two ounces from Utah last year. Fuckers were both mixed strains at 350 US each, and they were short. One of them had allot of low to mid grade buds in it (shitty fluffy popcorn). Fuck that. I think it was the middle man more than the dealer. How the fuck do I know their dealer isn&#039;t ordering his weed here anyway? I don&#039;t. Some of it was high grade, just not enough for the price.<br /><br />SR has my business now. And the vendors can expect my first orders soon.<br />Wish I had learned about this place before but better late than never.<br />
