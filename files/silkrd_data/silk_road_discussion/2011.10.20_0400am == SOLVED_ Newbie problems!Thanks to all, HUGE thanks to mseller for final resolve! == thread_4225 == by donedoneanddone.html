				Hi all,<br /><br />I hope this is OK to post here. I am new. I have done a transfer through Mt. Gox and finally got confirmation that transaction is completed. At this point, I am clueless as to how this works. (getting the money onto the silk road account, etc).<br /><br />The 1st US seller that has what I&#039;m looking for (Lortab 10&#039;s, Perc 10&#039;s and Xanax 1 or 2mg) and a good feedback rating that will send me explicit instructions, I will buy from you. I guess I need a &quot;silk road&quot; for dummies, lol.<br /><br />Thanks in advance...<br /><br />B<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

				hey pretty much just go into your account page on the sellers/buyers portion of the website. Not the forums(you are here). Then click the button in the top left that says account. It will give you the address to desposit into. Now at this point you can withdrawl from MTGox to this address, or transfer your mtgox coins to another address then into SR. There seems to be some issues with depositing coins atm(long wait periods) so you might want to hold off untill this is resolved.

				So you have bitcoins in your Mt.Gox account? It is generally a good idea to transfer those coins to your Bitcoin Wallet (bitcoin.org) and/or eWallet instead of directly transferring it to SR (don&#039;t want to leave any traces). Only thing you need in order to initiate the transfer is the unique Bitcoin address for your wallet(s).<br /><br />You can get an eWallet @ instawallet.org and that will create a unique link which you will need to bookmark in order to access it for future purposes.<br /><br />Then you transfer the coins from your wallet to SR, using your SR Wallet Bitcoin address. Hope that helps.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a seller btw&nbsp; :P<br /><br />edit: What GaltRR said, I would hold off on depositing coins into SR too til the site is back 100%.

				Go to &quot;Withdraw Funds&quot; select Bit Coins enter the number of BTC to transfer and the address (I would say from your Silk Road account &quot;deposit bitcoins&quot; is the way I do, I trust their tumbler). You will do fine. When you make a purchase, find the item you want, and use &quot;add to cart&quot; button or link, whatever. Then use all due care and caution for your shipping address. Get up to speed on using PGP, if you care at all about your privacy. That took me a day or to on the Mac, but now I am a pro.

				Hi all, me again...thought I had it figured out, but I think I am SO close, lol. I finally managed to get to the Mt. Gox login portion and &quot;thought&quot;all was good. I clicked on bitcoins and copied my bitcoin wallet address along with the amount I want to transfer. I clicked &quot;send request&quot; and got the following:<br /><br />&quot;Invalid amount, limit reached or not enough bitcoins in your account&quot;<br /><br />After looking at the top of the page, I see this and am assuming it has something to do with it.<br /><br />$349.32000&nbsp; |&nbsp; 0.00000000 BTC <br /><br />So, now, any ideas?? It shows the dollar amount I was expecting but 0 BTC&#039;s. Do I need to do something to convert the dollars into bitcoins OR transfer dollars to my bitcoin wallet? I&#039;m afraid to push too many options without knowing what I&#039;m doing for fear that I will lose my money, lol. <br /><br />Also, the &quot;bitcoin address&quot; it asks for is the long number from my bitcoin wallet, right? Just want to be sure.<br /><br />Oh, and FYI, my promise to buy from those of you gracious enough to help me is still 100% in effect. If I haven&#039;t said it before, I will say it now. You guys are the BEST and absolutely invaluable to me by helping me through this process. I&#039;m almost ashamed at the amount of time I have spent trying to figure this out! <br /><br />I don&#039;t tell many people this, but I am a stage 2 stomach cancer patient at the ripe old age of 34. My doctor&#039;s are afraid to prescribe me anything for pain because of my age (gotta love the DEA), regardless of my suffering for fear of becoming addicted. This is my 3rd diagnosis in 3 years and the only short term &quot;remedy&quot; thus far has been surgery because this cancer cannot be treated with chemo or radiation. I&#039;ve had 2 surgeries with extreme pain only to have it come back again and again. <br /><br />The Doctor&#039;s tell me I can have medication when I am diagnosed with 3 months or less to live. Without treatment, at best, I&#039;m looking at a year. If I decide to have another surgery the best prognosis might be 18 months. I just don&#039;t think I can handle it again.<br /><br />So, bottom line, I need to get this done. I am going out of my mind over here. I don&#039;t sleep and all I can think of is the pain. For God&#039;s sake, I was the designated driver on my 21&#039;st birthday and I&#039;ve smoked pot three times in my life. I will NEVER judge anyone who has an addiction or uses for other reasons, but in my particular case a party isn&#039;t what I&#039;m after.<br /><br />Sorry for the long post and thank you a hundred times over for any and all help! I am not even close to wealthy and this was some of the last money to my name. I can&#039;t lose it...<br /><br />Although, at this point, I&#039;d be willing to mail cash to a trusted seller. I know it&#039;s probably not the smartest idea, but the pain is overtaking my sensibility. <br /><br />Sincerely and most grateful,<br />donedoneanddone

				Hey mate, I&#039;m very sorry to hear about your situation. All the best to you and I hope for a quick recovery. Hang in there buddy...Sending positive vibes your way.<br /><br />On to your Bitcoin situation. What you&#039;ll need to do is convert that dollar amount to bitcoins. On the left menu, click on Trade. Then you&#039;ll see Buy Bitcoins. Enter the amount of btcs you wish to purchase, then Buy. Once you have the bitcoins in your account, click on Withdraw Funds and that&#039;s where you&#039;ll initiate the transfer.<br /><br />Don&#039;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns.

I did the withdraw and now the top section has changed from dollars to BTC&#039;s <br /><br />It says I have 137.66291545 BTC <br /><br />I clicked &quot;withdraw&quot;, chose the 1st option (bitcoins), then in the amount to withdraw I put in 137 to which I then entered my &quot;bitcoin address&quot; (which I&#039;m assuming is the 34 digit code from my bitcoin wallet). I then clicked &quot;send request&quot;<br /><br />I got the message saying: &quot;Invalid amount, limit reached or not enough bitcoins in your account&quot;<br /><br />I tried a lower amount, same thing. Any idea? Also, do you know what the check box below the bitcoin address that says &quot;use green address&quot; is? I left that unchecked.<br /><br />Thanks again...

				mseller,<br /><br />Of all the time I have spent on Mt. Gox, I never noticed the limit until you said that! Hard to believe a real life College gave me a degree, isn&#039;t it? I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person but that process kicked my butt...lol. Thank you so much. I found the limit, did the transfer and finally got confirmation that the funds are on their way to my bitcoin wallet. <br /><br />I hope I&#039;m not the only idiot who, when using this service for the first time, had some confusing setbacks. Although I of course still feel like a total moron. <br /><br />To everyone who took the time to help me: TheBlackDahlia, GaltRR, infamousryan, Cgault&nbsp; and you, mseller I cannot tell you how very much I appreciate it! Thank you so much for seeing me through this.<br /><br />Now, I just wait and see how long it takes to get to my bitcoin wallet. Any ideas on time frames there?<br /><br />

				Good luck man, welcome to the libertarian or underground or overground economy. Be cool, take care.....be careful. Don&#039;t blab, think things through on completing purchases, especially the real, meat based world part. We have tech to keep you safe, but the TOR and PGP technologies cant substitute for taking care in your actions on the street.

				Hi guys, me again. I&#039;ve posted a help topic on the security board, but also thought I&#039;d reply here in case different folks will see it.<br /><br />My bitcoins have been stuck in the bitcoin wallet for days now. I am stuck at 8 connections and 132,912 blocks. Mt.Gox is saying I need to get to 150,000 and change to see the coins to get them over to here. <br /><br />I have added the Port 8333, added bitcoin.exe to my exception list and every other suggestion I have found that I understood. Mt.Gox is only telling me to &quot;wait&quot; and they&#039;ll eventually show up. The hours have turned into many days now and nothing.<br /><br />Any advice?<br /><br />Thanks guys...P.S. Am willing to make a donation for anyone who can help me get these hundred coins of my last money in this entire world. Desperation could equal a nice payday for someone. Thanks in advance!

				MTgox are quite correct, be patient , 8 connections is good, you need it to count to 150727+ blocks <br /><br />

				Im not sure what type of machine you are on, but if you pull up a network activity monitor, can you see if the wallet is even sending data to / from the network? No activity would be problematic and maybe you have a corrupted file, and there are probably ways to restart the wallet, non-destructive repair of the wallet file? I dont use a wallet, but others might have a suggestion as to what ones does when it stalls way short of the total blocks. <br /><br />Its not moving the total numbers of blocks rev&#039;d, right? Or is it just creeping?&nbsp; If it is way slow, maybe you have other network activity blocking or saturating the ports.

				Tons of threads on this at bitcoin talk.&nbsp; I had same problem, had to go research and learn how to first check if my block has been processed.&nbsp; This is very common problem.&nbsp; Always go first to: blockexplorer.com make sure your address is there.&nbsp; Hell, didn&#039;t take much searching to find your problem...join this site, look around:<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47297.0<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47788.0<br /><br />edit: error in blockexplorer addy

				Wondering if anyone could help me???&nbsp; I have a missing deposit from our lovely friends over at Mt Gox.&nbsp; Block explorer can&#039;t is showing no activity on that address. <br /><br />What are your opinions?<br /><br />Is it a Mt Gox problem?<br /><br />I assume it is since the address is not even showing up in block explorer.<br /><br />**Update** It did show up on block explorer, not in the wallet yet...holding my fingers.<br /><br />New question:<br />Does block explorer have a lag?&nbsp; If some how much?&nbsp; I still think Mt Gox took their sweet time.

				I&#039;m like you: if there&#039;s a lag anywhere, I get it.&nbsp; But my own experience is that if it shows up on blockexplorer, I&#039;ll get it eventually, tho sometimes &#039;eventually&#039; can cover a lot of ground.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to do the manual download of the blocks...but as long as I got my wallet.dat, I&#039;ll get it one way or another...one of my computers, a little netbook with SSD rather than regular hard drive, seems to always be slow, always stopping somewhere...and some geek explained it was my SSD that was the problem, but the solution was just to download blocks on another faster computer, all that...pain in the ass...sounds like in your case, like mine, it&#039;s just a matter of time tho...

				Pretty funny (more like sad though) you couldn&#039;t figure out how to work the site by yourself lol<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel like its safe for ANYONE to be sending you drugs if you couldn&#039;t even figure out how to buy them on your own.
