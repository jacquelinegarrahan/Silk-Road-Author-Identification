				I reposted in Security.&nbsp; For now it&#039;s there.&nbsp; In case it gets deleted again, this is the text of the message:<br /><br />---<br /><br />I just wanted to let everyone know about something very strange that happened earlier.<br /><br />At the SR logon screen, the random code generator &quot;randomly&quot; spit out the name of the router I connect to.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really see how this is possible but it did happen.&nbsp; <br /><br />My router name is 8 digits which included a 5 letters followed by a 3 digit number.&nbsp; By my calculation the chances of this happening randomly are 1 in 2,821,109,907,456.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry, but that is just a little to much for me to believe it was random.<br /><br />Sorry guys, but I&#039;m out.&nbsp; Given the nature of SR, the chance of something being fishy with this is too much for me.&nbsp; I just thought I&#039;d let everyone know before disappearing and deleting Tor.

				Hm. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a coincidence or not, but when I was trying to type my login name for my site name/pw, frames kept popping up asking me to &quot;save&quot; the information in my documents. :O

				When I posted the text above in the Security section, the title was &quot;Site compromised?&nbsp; Please read.&quot;.&nbsp; When I reloaded, it was there.&nbsp; When I reloaded again, it had been removed.&nbsp; That&#039;s when I posted this thread in this section.&nbsp; I have since reposted in the Security section with the title &quot;Lets try this again.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what to make of all of it.

				it is very annoying when posts here are deleted with no explanation given at all, happened to a thread I was posting in once and none of the mods would even give a reply to my request for info on why it was deleted.

				That&#039;s just the cops idea of fun. They like to drop subtle clues that they&#039;re coming just to give you a head start before they swoop in and rape you.
