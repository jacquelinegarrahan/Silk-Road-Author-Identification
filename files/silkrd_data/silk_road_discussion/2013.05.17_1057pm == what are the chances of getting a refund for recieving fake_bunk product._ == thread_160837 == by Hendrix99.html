				Ive never had to do this , the only Time Ive gone into resoloution was with SamGiancana and He was banned from SR so I got 100% refund automaticly<br /><br />Now this issue is differnt<br />I ordered Crack with express shipping . he supplied me with tracking # and order arrived promptly so I was Very happy excited <br />Well When I opened the package it was not as pictured at all.<br />It was all white powder, at first I thought he sent me coke by mistake, <br />anyways I load a bit in the straight shooter, because its all powder a&nbsp; bunch sux through the brillo and i get on my tounge, all i can taste is baking soda<br /><br />anyways light it up and no cracking or melting, it just turns black then white with little to no smoke but what it does produce tastes awful.<br />now I try to snort a lil just for shits and my nose just runs instantly<br /><br />I try real hard but have same results with all of it except a few lil pieces u cold tell were harder&nbsp; and looked a lil different , they melted and produced some vapor. but almost all of it was bunk(baking soda im sure of it)<br /><br />anyways Ive talked to the vendor about it and he hasnt responded yet but&nbsp; Ive explained myself and want to work with the guy because I just want whats fair. <br /><br />What are the chances for getting a refund in resoloution when this happens? how about even 50%? which I would meet in the middle<br /><br />Im not going to bash this vendor or name him&nbsp; until I talk to him and work it out to see his side<br />Just want to see what other people who have been through this or heard of others , what is the usual outcome?<br /><br />Thanks alot<br />

				this bitch sent me fake crystal meth but she&nbsp; had negative feedback starting about her so I got 100% refund she offered 75% i said fuck you you waste my time with salt crystals, i actually injected some salt into my veins.. Thats crystal wife or something like that.. I was noob back then didn&#039;t do proper research.<br /><br /><br />P.S. TRY injecting cocaine IV - it is stronger rush also you get long high and feel like you had enough and can put down needle after a few strong bellringers. :)

				I don&#039;t know your chances a lot would depend on the vendor. Hopefully he is an honest vendor in which case he would admit to his mistake and offer you a 100% refund.&nbsp; Anyways, good luck, I hope it works out.<br />PS, try to come with a resolution with the vendor before filing a dispute, that is a much more respectful way of going about it in my opinion. It shows the vendor that you give him the benefit of the doubt to work things out. If you are not satisfied with his response than I agree 100% with you filing a dispute. If I were you I wouldn&#039;t accept anything less than a 100% refund.<br /><br />Just my $0.02

				If you believe you have received bunk product you should take the order to resolution and state your case, providing any evidence to support your claim. The administrator may ask you to upload a picture or two as well - not entirely sure as I&#039;ve never had such an issue.<br /><br />Take it to resolution though!<br /><br />Libertas

				It&#039;s always 50/50 if both parties dispute the transaction, unless one fails to contest the transaction or just simply gives it all away you will both be walking away with half.

The adminstrator presiding over the resolution takes many things into account (one being the histories of both parties) when deciding upon the percentage of refund that will be issued, and carefully weighs the evidence and statements provided and the relative reputations of the parties involved.<br /><br />Libertas
