				I am looking to buy from a new domestic vendor as they have seem to have exactly what I need.

				I think it is shitty when people put their hands up for samples and then don&#039;t review them. If you are going to ask for a sample, you should make sure to only claim it if you can review it in good time. If I took a sample, i&#039;d make sure to review it the weekend after I got it, at the latest ;)

				There are a lot of people on SR and everywhere that hear the word &quot;free&quot; and they jump on it, no matter what it is! Offer someone a free kick in the teeth and &quot;free&quot; is probably all they hear! I had free samples of my mylar bags and jars so people could see what it looked like before buying bulk but not a single sample led to a sale, they were all just junkies looking for free stuff! That is why I don&#039;t give any samples on any items anymore! Assholes abuse the system and screw it up for the serious people!

				If you can&#039;t review it within a few days, don&#039;t take the sample. Cannabis reviews should be very prompt, stronger things may take a bit longer due to finding a good night to do it, but even then it should be quick.

Some people do not have the ability to get high at their leisure and need to set aside time to do so. I have never once seen a free sample offer where the vendor have a time table for when the review was due. I agree that the review should be given in a reasonable amount of time, and should always be given no matter what the circumstance. There is likely a discernible ratio for the number of samples given out to the number of reviews the vendor actually gets. I do my best to review as soon as I can and give great and honest reviews, but your arbitrary 6 day window is sometimes just not workable for me. If a vendor specifically asked for a review within a time frame&nbsp; which I could not provide I would not ask. <br /><br />I am not typing in opposition to your statement exactly, but I wanted to add to the conversation.<br /><br />Regards,<br />T4B

				Allow me to elaborate a bit. Review of stealth, weight, appearance, and communication should be done immediately. Quality should be updated as soon as possible and within any time frame outlined by the generous vendor.<br /><br />It is important to remember most free samples are typically offered by new vendors and the people receiving the samples are taking a risk by putting their addresses in the hands of an unproven member of our community.

If you want to be a reviewer of a sample you have a responsibility on your hand. If your &quot;situation&quot; is one that you cannot review the sample as soon as you get it (or at max in 48 hours) then don&#039;t apply for a sample.<br /><br />Every time I got a sample I wrote a review immediately and before applying I knew I could do it; if I couldn&#039;t I would not have asked the sample. The problem is that people when they hear &quot;sample&quot; hear instead &quot;free drugs&quot;, and they take it with this mindset, instead you are like actually *working* for the vendor in that time frame and you took a responsibility on yourself. A sample is not a free drug offer, it is like a exchange when you get product for your time and opinion, so you better give that time and opinion in return.<br /><br />Apart a lack of respect to the vendor it is also a lack of respect towards the community as a whole.

				I certainly do not intend to be the defender of dishonest people who do not even bother to follow through on their commitments. Fuck those people. <br /><br />I am trying to expand the conversation because I have had some delayed quality reviews on samples because of real life obligations that prevent me from partaking as freely as I would like to. I was never trying to be dishonest to the vendor in any way and always updated with the quality review as soon as I could. When the product arrived I always reviewed packaging, appearance, communication, speed of delivery etc immediately.. Which is plenty to get a new vendor going in the community honestly. If the product is arriving and packaged properly, odds are the vendor isn&#039;t shipping garbage. Reviews of that nature should be good enough at least starting out to get business underway. I have yet to find a vendor who provided samples and was not putting their best foot forward to establish their credentials.

				It really depending on what the product is.&nbsp; People have lives, and many drugs are not simply a daily activity to most.&nbsp; I would personally say within about a week and a half would be a reasonable guideline for most substances.&nbsp; Cannabis would be a bit different - with most qualified individuals smoking daily - so, maybe a few days by the time you smoke it ~3 times and properly consider the taste and effect.

You agreed on reviewing a sample so it is YOUR duty to stand by a deadline, not the duty of the vendor to ask for one. If you cannot either don&#039;t accept the sample or inform the vendor about it so s/he can make an informed decision.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=194326.msg1401715#msg1401715">Quote from: Turkey for Breakfast on August 01, 2013, 04:57 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you think about it, the people who have the most experience in many cases are the ones a vendor would want providing the reviews..

What you say would have a point if the reviewers were only 1 or 2 so they cannot certainly test everything and in a fast manner, but since at this point there are a lot of reviewers (and very good at it) you can simply pass if you know you will not have enough time to do that in a certain timeframe. <br /><br />I know, it&#039;s good to receive a sample, but I repeat, it&#039;s not &quot;free drugs&quot; and you are, I&#039;m sorry to say that - and don&#039;t take it as a personal accusation, please -&nbsp; abiding to that mentality here. Everyone likes to have a freebye if s/he can and if you can either help the community with it and a vendor it&#039;s either better, but, again, this is NOT what a sample is about, I&#039;m sorry. Your aren&#039;t doing a favor to the vendor posting a review, a sample is like a contract you have with a vendor that sends you product for a review, it is like being paid to do a job. If you accept the contract then you must abide to it, you cannot do it at your leisure, because the vendor is PAYING you. Do you understand this, do you? It is not a freebye, it is not a favor, it is a paid job to which you agreed to before hand.<br /><br />Suppose you get a job to do a painting and you accept it: if you do, you cannot then say &quot;oh, I have a family and a job, I cannot do it now, I will wait next week&quot;. Good luck on having work after that. You accepted the job, so you accepted on making the paint. The excuse &quot;I don&#039;t have time now&quot; have no place just because you should have known before accepting the paint that you had the trouble and so either decided to work something out to get the time or not accept the job to start with.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=194326.msg1401715#msg1401715">Quote from: Turkey for Breakfast on August 01, 2013, 04:57 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am not saying a reviewer should drag it out for exorbitant lengths of time, but allowing a reasonable time frame for a seasoned user should not be cause for criticism.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />An user, seasoned or not, is not FORCED to accept a sample, it is done willingly. If you accept you must also accept the inherent rules of the thing, that should be giving the review as soon as possible. If you cannot then simply don&#039;t accept the sample, it&#039;s that easy. When you will have the time at the next occasion you will. Yes, you will probably miss a product you may like, but, again, a sample is NOT &quot;free drugs&quot;.

				I can see both sides of this one, but on balance, I think BlackIris has made some good points. I&#039;ve only accepted 1 free sample from a vendor, and I made clear that I&#039;d prefer to pay since I wasn&#039;t going to be able to properly review the product right away. He sent it anyway, so I indulged when I could and posted a review once I had done so.<br /><br />I just wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable accepting a sample when I either 1) couldn&#039;t test it and report back in a timely manner, or 2) wasn&#039;t very familiar with the product and wouldn&#039;t be able to make an informed review.<br /><br />To answer the OP&#039;s question, I&#039;d say 72 hours to test and write a review should be the goal, unless you&#039;ve made clear to the vendor ahead of time that you aren&#039;t in a position to do so.
