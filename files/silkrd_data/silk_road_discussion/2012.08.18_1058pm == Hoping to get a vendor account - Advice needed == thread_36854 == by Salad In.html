				I have an account where i have bought a few things. The account has a silly name, and it also gave one low score to a prominent vendor who may have been annoyed i believed the quality of his product was low. I had planned to sell weed (UK to UK percys only) at some point in the future.<br /><br />That time has arrived! But I read a thread detailing how new vendor accounts will now only be auctioned off?<br /><br />I looked in my account on SR and saw that there was an upgrade account option?<br /><br />What would people suggest I do? I can&#039;t afford to bid with bitcoins, pounds to bc is silly last few times i checked. Can i still upgrade my account? Will people buy from an account with a silly name lol?<br /><br />

				if you want to become a vendor make a new account. never buy and sell from the account.<br /><br />click &#039;account&#039; at the top of the SR page, then &#039;become a seller&#039; on the right hand side. all the info is there including the price (changes with exchange rate fluctuations).<br /><br />as far as i know you dont have to &#039;bid&#039; for it, just pay the asking price. thats how it worked when i got mine anyway.<br /><br />best of luck!
