				I just thought of this. It is merely an idea. <br />Here it goes.<br /><br />Once a vendor marks a product in-transit and actually sends it, 50% of the BTC (cost of product) goes to the vendor and the other 50% remains in escrow.<br />No vendor should mark it in-transit before sending the product.<br /><br />The remaining half will be held by SR and released once the buyer finalizes the transaction after receiving and inspecting the goods.<br /><br />In case of any problem or customs letter, the remaining 50% can be used as refund or resolution.<br /><br />Hopefully this could get rid of the want of vendors for the buyers to finalize early. <br /><br />Buyers on their side should take the 50% risk once they purchase from a vendor. They should research about the vendor first and make sure they are ready to receive the product.<br /><br />What do you guys think of this idea?

				50:50 would just not be ideal. 10:90 may work.

				Why would you finalize early? You&#039;re just asking to be scammed. If a vendor requests it then just go elsewhere, it&#039;s against SR policy so they have no right to ask you to do it. I got scammed twice by foolishly doing it when I first joined over a year ago and haven&#039;t FE&#039;d once since that. Two other vendors tried to do it but I just went into resolution and got a full refund as neither seller could provide proof of postage, that&#039;s why we have the escrow system ;)

				Or even better, don&#039;t work with vendors that ask you to FE? You pay a small premium on top of the value of your goods for the resolution center, which is very good at what it does. <br /><br />Now, consider the cost/benefit ratio when you want to FE. I have finalized early twice so far. Once for $13 dollars, and once for $50. I received both products.<br /><br />You have to think, is the deal too good to be true? And how much you&#039;re willing to risk, because I consider every dollar that I FE to be lost.

That would work pretty well.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What you are proposing is pretty much how the escrow system ends up working (50/50 each way) in resolution, except with the current system there is the total ability to vary from 100%/0% to 0%/100% based on the evidence either way. Its far from perfect but I think its better than most alternatives,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is basically a market where both sides want to remain as anonymous as possible while sending a non reversible transaction to each other. Its not possible to completely remove scamming, but the escrow system is the best we are going to get.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The main flaw with the current system is that there is incentive for both buyer and vendor to resolve amicably without going to resolution: much quicker and doesn&#039;t affect stats. This is going to mean a 50/50 split of the loss in most cases. Unfortunately this tendency can be used by both scam vendors and scam buyers to get 50% free. Buyers can do something against this by mentioning what happened in feedback, so that it will be noticed if a vendor is doing this more often than you would expect...... but wait, this could mean the vendor has just been victim of lots of scam buyers!!!! ARRRGH!!! whenever I try band think about this I just end up thinking rounnd in circles,&nbsp; until I realise theccurrent system is as good as can be expected.
