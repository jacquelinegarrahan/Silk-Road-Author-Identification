				I don&#039;t know if anyone noticed, but it turns out that the forum software provides a PM filtering system. <br /><br />Go to your PM inbox, then select &#039;Preferences&#039;, then select &#039;Add New Rule&#039; on the right side.<br /><br />1. In the name box, pit something like, oh, I dunno, maybe &#039;www.btkoin.com&#039;. <br />2. Under the Criteria drop down list, select &#039;Message Subject Contains&#039;.<br />3. In the text box right beside that, enter in &#039;www.btkoin.com&#039;.<br />4. Go down to the actions section, and select &#039;Delete Message&#039; from the drop down list.<br /><br />The text in the description box should look like this: If message subject contains &quot;www.btkoin.com&quot; then delete the message. Now select &#039;Save Rule&#039;, and the next page, select &#039;Apply Rules Now&#039;.<br /><br />The spammer is using a bot, which in this case is a good thing because ( at least so far ) the subject is always the same. After that, you will just need to modify your rule as the subject changes. Sorry, it won&#039;t help in the forum at all.

				or just check &quot;hide my online status&quot; or uncheck &quot;show my online status&quot; I don&#039;t remember what smf calls it, but the spammer is only sending messages to those who are &quot;online&quot; hide your status and you won&#039;t get the PMs any more and you won&#039;t have to add rules as the spammer changes his message :)

				I like being shown as online&nbsp; ;D 8)<br /><br />I did modify the rule to also include &quot;message body contains&quot; &quot;www.bitkoin.com&#039;&quot; and then select &quot;Any criteria met&quot; or whatever...<br /><br />It&#039;s possible for them to take the link out of the subject line... but it&#039;s less likely they will change domains altogether.
