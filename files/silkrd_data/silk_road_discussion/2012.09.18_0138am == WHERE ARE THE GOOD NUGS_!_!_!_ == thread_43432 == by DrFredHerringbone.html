				Ok. Sooooo the last 2 orders i&#039;ve made for cannabis have fell EXTREMELY short as far as quality goes....I really want to put the sellers on blast but i&#039;m not that mad anymore...1 order was from a person that&#039;s been on the road for awhile and it was for a &quot;4 gram sampler&quot; and needless to say they were ALL the same...if they were any different it was very slight. Hardly any aroma, dry, outdoor nugs basically...then i ordered some &quot;AAA SUPER POTENT&quot; shit that was basically a complete and utter joke. barely got a head change, no smell, no nothing. NOTHING. ....and who are these people leaving 5/5 on the feedback??????? Have they never actually smoked weed????? I don&#039;t get it...anyways I guess what i&#039;m ranting about is WHO is the go to for the HANDS DOWN BEST CANNABIS ON THE ROAD...?? <br /><br />I&#039;m listening

				There&#039;s so much weed on here that it&#039;s all about finding your price range, a vendor that you click with, and most importantly for me, the strain you desire. By &quot;4 gram sampler&quot; do you mean felidae&#039;s grand opening sale? I found that to be extremely good quality. Perhaps your THC tolerance is getting out of hand and you need to destroy it even further by adding some hash on top of your weed!&nbsp; ;D

				I agree with OP people around here really don&#039;t know what good weed is. I like to sample weed so I order from pretty much everyone domestic (ecxept from that milehighmedicine guys multiple accounts)&nbsp; and most have great reviews but the weed is always mediocre, except for a few reliable sellers. Literally only 3 sellers reliable on here.<br /><br />I think it comes down to people not knowing what real AAA weed is like, it has to be. If you&#039;ve seen good weed before there&#039;s no way you would be praising the sellers on here and if you did know good weed, I can&#039;t even begin to understand the praise you people have for getting fucked over repeatedly.

				Maybe one day I&#039;ll get the urge to order outside the states again but untill that day....<br /><br />There has been a few new vendors pop up in the states that I been meaning to check out, though. <br />I&#039;ll probably try out these new guys then go back to smoking on my own bud, my stash is getting a little out of control.

				I mean yes what we call beasters in the states is M39, however it&#039;s the export quality that is trimmed badly and screened for kief. The M39 in Canada (they call it china bud) is much better in my limited experience of it, it&#039;s like some acapulco gold or power plant in the way that it&#039;s grown for being a hearty, big yielder rather than being a gourmet strain. I actually like it for packing bowls since it&#039;s so dense, packing a nugget lasts a lot longer than an airy sativa in that sense.

M39 however is the best bud for resale in my mind... the reason being, Its holds its size, smell, look. Gets the average smoker ripped and looks like it should be framed because it looks so nice..

				Read the review threads in rumors before ordering next time. You made it to the forums how did you not instinctively check them out?<br />You&#039;d be forgiven for getting scammed by speed vendors (90% of all speed being sold on SR is a scam/selective scam.. it&#039;s iriduclous, these vendors remain in top sellers because they sell average quality other drugs- but they can keep putting up auctions of solvent and caffeine listed as speed- get only 5/5 for FE- while people who arent too lazy to change their feedback to 1/5 after finding out its shit. coupled with tons of negative reviews. People like AAkoven should be have the lab tests forced posted on his page if he&#039;s to put up more auctions. Whoever runs SR clearly doesn&#039;t giev a shit that a vendor has been scamming 100% in one section as long as they get their commission.

				MmmKay....... let me put it to you guys this way......<br /><br />alot of vendors on here have weed they say is good @ $300 a Zip<br /><br />Now you know damn well that great weed is $500 plus a Zip elsewhere, the Road is no different.<br /><br />If you are paying $300 for a Zip and think you&#039;re getting a great deal and awesome weed....... you&#039;re mistaken.<br /><br />Any vendor selling a Zip for less than $400 and promises you its perfect and potent is full of shit ! ! ! ! it will either be bone dry or damp like its been left out in the rain for a week ! ! ! ! or will have no smell ! ! ! ! or potency ! ! ! !<br /><br />Vendor have said weed at said prices ? prove me wrong ! ! ! !<br /><br />I as well as the rest, wish you could get quality grass at those prices @ less than $400 per Zip... keep dreaming, it isn&#039;t 1980 anymore. I hate to pay $600 for something I know is going in one lung and out the other, especially when money is tight for all.<br /><br />You will get what you pay for, if you&#039;re ordering grass @ less than say $500 a Zip, your going to get disappointed every time. and I see alot of it from top vendors the skushes, the premium indoor canna&#039;s, the og kush&#039;s&nbsp; etc etc etc...... you know who you are.

				Bottom line, your not going to get awesome super silver haze on here for less than $500 a Zip and I know a new and up and coming vendor had it for less than $400. Im sure is was decent super silver haze, or good, but it wasn&#039;t great super silver haze. Do you understand what i&#039;m saying ?

				The farmers market used to have weed that cost up to and over $800 a Zip and people used to pay it... $200 per quarter, no ounce price.<br /><br />It was top notch organic and directly from a stable and consistent grower, so it didn&#039;t go through a lot of different peoples dirty oily hands before it got to you.<br /><br />I would never pay that for something going up in smoke though, no matter how great it was said to be. It&#039;s going to be burnt up and im not inclined to pay a lot for it. that&#039;s like paying $100 for a plate of food you know you&#039;re going to be shitting out in a couple hours...... though it might have tasted good at the time.......

You need deep pockets or to live in a med state.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am pretty sure you&#039;re talking about my SSH, but it doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; I just want to say that it is absolutely ridiculous to draw conclusions about the quality of any bud simply because it is being sold under some arbitrary price point.&nbsp; To say that you aren&#039;t getting great bud if you&#039;re paying under $400/oz tells me that you have no idea what the bud market is like on the west coast.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to say anything about the quality of my dro, but I think it is generally agreed upon that the best bud in the country, and possibly the world, comes from the west coast, and no matter how good the bud was, you would generally be laughed at trying to charge $400 or more for an oz.

				I completely agree that price doesn&#039;t determine quality.&nbsp; Marketing is an incredible thing.<br /><br />Amidst this mess, I once again point you towards uniwiz&#039;s thread...it really does a have a good amount of community input and that&#039;s basically the only thing you have to go on in an anonymous marketplace ;)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10062.0

You made it to the forums how did you not instinctively check them out?<br />You&#039;d be forgiven for getting scammed by speed vendors (90% of all speed being sold on SR is a scam/selective scam.. it&#039;s iriduclous, these vendors remain in top sellers because they sell average quality other drugs- but they can keep putting up auctions of solvent and caffeine listed as speed- get only 5/5 for FE- while people who arent too lazy to change their feedback to 1/5 after finding out its shit. coupled with tons of negative reviews. People like AAkoven should be have the lab tests forced posted on his page if he&#039;s to put up more auctions. Whoever runs SR clearly doesn&#039;t giev a shit that a vendor has been scamming 100% in one section as long as they get their commission.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are so many good cannabis vendors I can&#039;t keep up with them. I thank all the people who review in my thread by giving a +1. I also +1 good vendors too;)<br />You all have your favorites, and that&#039;s good. The best part of SR is all the variety. Strains I could never get IRL, oils, and edibles.<br />I see no mention of Christy Nugs. I&#039;ll always have some of her buds. Others mention here I wouldn&#039;t go without either. The list can&#039;t be held in one post anymore.<br /><br />Thanks mushitup for the mention.

				just got 1.24 oz of the Daily blessing Kush offered by muskabuzz. double vac sealed. no odor. <br />35g&#039;s of weed on my scale. moderately compressed from aggressive vacuum sealing. shit was stuck together like glue. reminded me of the &quot;lamb&#039;s breath&quot; we would get from jamaica annually down south. fluffed out nicely in my CV humidor by freshstor.com (clearnet)<br />triched out to the max. this would be A grade machine trimmed outdoor/greenhouse/high yield indoor if it wasn&#039;t compressed for shipping.<br />the calyxs look very mountain grown kush- like...tight and dense. almost on top of each other. the leaf is dark green reminiscent of an equatorial sativa. the nose is very earthy, with an undertone of sweetness. very pleasant. i could smell it all day. PROFESSIONALLY cured! Could be left vacuum sealed indefinitely in my opinion.<br />the smoke is very kush-like on the inhale:EARTHY....expands rapidly then the HEAVY exhale reveals it&#039;s fruity sativa side....cough, cough. <br />the high is like a bucking bronco initially. heady, racing, invigorating then medicating and long lasting. a great daily driver if you can handle the heavy sativa &quot;come on.&quot; i find it quite nice with my morning coffee.<br />i find it quite therapuetic for my nausea and achy, arthritic joints. im a daily smoker for almost 30 years and this is some of the best cannabis i have seen at this price in years ($260/35g!). ive been in the midwest and south where prices have been $100/quarter or $325/oz for 20 years for seedless triched out dank nugs....so for me this was a super buy and will be in my humidor for the next year to come!<br /><br />thanks Muskabuzz for spreading JAH love!&nbsp; 8)<br />

				felidae?&nbsp; Are you finally back on the road?&nbsp; I bookmarked you on SR when you first popped up a couple months back.&nbsp; You had some great looking bud.&nbsp; Unfortunately it all sold out before I could get some.&nbsp; Are you back now with more bud?<br /><br />The guy talking about $500 ounces is either a vendor trying to drive prices up or a fucking idiot.&nbsp; The most I have ever paid for an ounce in my dry-town is $420.
