				Was doing this for ~50BTC (albeit before the spike), but am currently considering a 1 week special at 5 BTC. Last time I checked lim&#039;s guide was 150 BTC<br /><br />Any interest from vendors? Posting this in the vendor forum as well but not everyone has access<br /><br />Please PM me to discuss.

				I don&#039;t mean to beat a dead horse here, and honestly my opinion&#039;s not worth much, however I&#039;m struggling to understand why you wrote you&#039;d release more info here, but then just had a vague &quot;introduction&quot; that gave no information except to highlight how little you thought of similar vendors.<br /><br />I actually am interested, and have read a few e-books, but none of them really gave me better ideas than I&#039;ve come up with myself, which I admit are pretty basic... :)

This is per transaction, or per 24 hours, though structuring is detectable. You must report all income period. <br /><br />2nd thing that should make people question your knowledge is smuggling money out of the system without being reported is not laundering. smuggling is easy to do, buy gold, sell gold (or sell your coins locally for cash, no reporting necessary). laundering is easy to do if its within a reasonable limit, just claim your profits as part of a freelance trade and dont go over what people in your field reasonable make. Smuggle the capital, launder the profits. <br /><br />Why do people act like this is some sort of super awesome secret they know, if it were that dependent on the government not knowing how it works they wouldnt be in business very long.

My prices range from between £600 and £2500 depending on what you need. <br /><br />Let&#039;s not talk about people without first knowing what you are talking about yeah? Makes you look stupid and tbh, a bit shifty when you drop your competitions name like that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey Lim, I meant my comment with no offense whatsoever. Keywords in my post were &quot;before the spike&quot; and &quot;last time I checked&quot; - I was guessing you were not charging the same price now but hadn&#039;t seen anything differently in awhile. Given where you&#039;re coming in I definitely need to adjust my price as I don&#039;t have the same level of history. Probably around the 1-1.5 BTC range. Need to give some thought to this and see how things go validating with MrAnonymous :)

				Okay... So I have looked through the guide and the info in it is viable.<br /><br /><br />It will work.. Now it&#039;s not the &#039;BEST super duper Money Laundering guide of the century&#039; but the info in it is worth the 1-1.5BTC ($100 or so dollars) the vendor will charge.<br /><br /><br />It teaches you a method to use... It doesn&#039;t however teach you the game of laundering. If you are someone who needs to launder money but isn&#039;t willing to learn the whole game and just wants a step by step method to follow. <br /><br /><br />Then this will work for you.&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;m interested.&nbsp; <br /><br />My biggest concern is that I&#039;m in Canada and the information may be useless with references that don&#039;t make sense.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ll ask before I buy.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks everyone for making guides like this available.
