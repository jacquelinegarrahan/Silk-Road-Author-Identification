				Nothing you can do besides keep on buying. The only good thing about the new purchasing stats design is that it helps this issue in a way but also kind of makes it worse. There has to be vendors who won&#039;t require you to FE. Just start small and work your way up.

				If you can prove the item was never shipped then you can ask for your refund rate for that transaction to be nullified.

				The seller refunded the money himself with out needing an admin to resolve the issue and i have the pm from the vendor admitting the problems he had.<br /><br />I have sent support a message along with a copy of the private message from the vendor.fingers crossed.<br /><br />thanks guys.

				Well, it appears they like you. In my case, the vendor &quot;went on vacation&quot; and never came back. The last page or 2 of his feedback were all angry people who left low ratings. He went rogue 3 months after I first ordered (and still never received the product...yup, I had it in escrow the entire time haha). IMO, it was pretty obvious he was dicking around yet SR support wouldn&#039;t take the refund rate away. Oh well. At least I got a full refund.

				you could dilute it by buying some very low priced items, like a few cents or even $0 items.

				It&#039;s interesting that on SR, refund rates count against the buyer. On mainstream e-commerce sites like Amazon, refund rates count against the seller, the thought being, I suppose, that if a buyer needs a refund it&#039;s because the seller somehow screwed up. If your refund rates go above a certain amount on Amazon, your selling account will be put under review, suspended, or even permanently revoked. Amazon buyers can and do scam sellers left and right, knowing that Amazon will (almost) always side with the buyer and leave the seller to eat the loss. So it&#039;s kind of refreshing, or at least interesting, on SR to see that the admin is a little more on the side of sellers.

				The admin staff are on nobodies side, they look at each case individually and make an assessment based upon a consideration of a whole range of factors.

I guess what I should have said is that it&#039;s refreshing to see that admin is willing to look at both sides in a dispute and make a fair judgment, rather than more or less automatically taking one side or another. Sellers on Amazon like the exposure the site brings them, but ultimately know that the site admin will absolutely not have their backs in any dispute with a buyer.

				Selling on Amazon is a total bendover for the sellers, except for a handful of megasellers who seem to enjoy special treatment. And anyone who thinks the SR seller fees are high might want to check Amazon&#039;s seller fees and see that SR is actually pretty reasonable. Believe me, if Amazon should one day allow selling drugs on their site, very few vendors would defect from SR.
