				Have you thought about NOT being a meth addict? No offense dude, but if the site going down makes you get all angry because you can&#039;t get your fix, you might want to start working on that. I imagine a lot of addicts got a huge wake up call this week. I mean people like me that are buying for profit, our wallet took a small hit, but nothing I can&#039;t handle. If you&#039;re upset because you NEED METH RIGHT NOW, you need to maybe get some help. Go to the Drug Safety forum, they know their shit. Good luck dude.

				No worries man, I&#039;m not judging. Addiction is a shitty thing, and I don&#039;t mean to imply that it&#039;s easy to get out of. This should just be a wake up call to you that eventually getting off meth is a good idea. I hope you can do it some day, I&#039;m rooting for you anyways.

				thanks man, i appreciate your insight. i agree with you, addiction is basically like being in hell. i have been battling with addiction problems for about 3 years now, and i am currently 24. i am actually thrilled that i came across Silk Road, because before, i used to have to go to the bad parts of town to get my fix, but now with Silk Road, i can have my &quot;coffee&quot; (meth) mailed to me. <br /><br />i do realize i have an addiction problem, but im just not quite ready to give it up yet at the moment. i &quot;will&quot; one of these days though!

				Well this is America so you go ahead and do all the drugs you want. When the Government realizes that addiction is a health problem and not a criminal problem you will probably find it easier to stay clean. Until then stay away from the po po.
