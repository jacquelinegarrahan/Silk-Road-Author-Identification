				I am new and hope this isn&#039;t too annoying.&nbsp; In the buyers guide they speak of tumbler and how it sends the coins around to help with anonymity.<br />On the other hand there is bitcoinfog, that appears to do a similar function.&nbsp; Although I cannot seem to get to their site at all...<br /><br />Are the 2 redundant?&nbsp; Or both offer a similar service at different steps?&nbsp; <br /><br />Bitcoinfog for getting coins in SR, and tumbler for sending them out?&nbsp; Just want to be sure I understand completely.<br /><br />Thanks folks...

				I&#039;ve used BitcoinFog and would recommend it to others. They were down for 48 hours or more at one point, and they aren&#039;t available every so often, but the site is usually working. That is the biggest thing to be aware of.<br /><br />I have no experience with the tumbler.<br /><br />Whether you need one of these services to get coins into Silk Road is up to you. If you bought the coins with cash and a fake name then you might not deem it necessary to use a service like this to get the coins into your SR account. If you got your coins on an exchange where your account is linked to your personal information then you should use a mixing service before moving coins into SR.<br /><br />Every cash out service I know of (other than taking cash for coins in a private transaction of course) requires your real name. Taking coins from SR and getting funds into your bank account would be another instance where you should use a mixing service like the Fog.

				I see now.&nbsp; Tumbler is for payments leaving SR.&nbsp; Not coming in.<br /><br />Ok, sorry for the stupid question.&nbsp; Just delete this thread.

				It isn&#039;t a stupid question. I think there are a lot of people who don&#039;t use tumbling/mixing/anonymising services even though they should. Too many folks take the ease of use for granted. It is good that you are looking to get a basic understanding of anonymity with bitcoins before diving into any purchases.<br /><br />Make sure you know how to PGP encrypt your sensitive information as well and you&#039;ll be good to go.
