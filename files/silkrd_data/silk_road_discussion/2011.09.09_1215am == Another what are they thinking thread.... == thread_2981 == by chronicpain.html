				I just noticed a very reputable vendor got slammed on his rating because the product was broken. I noticed that the product was roxie 30&#039;s.. I know, from a lot of experience, that most roxies (especially the mallincrodt brand) are easily crushable.. Also, when you add the heat (sitting in vans etc) they become very breakable.<br /><br />First off, as long as the whole pill is there, whats the big deal? It most likely went up the buyers nose anyways.&nbsp; I know that the vendor didnt try to rip this customer off in any manner..<br /><br />I think people are wanting Amazon or Ebay type service. They forget what business they are in. It amazes me when I read comments like this. Now, if the quality wasn&#039;t up to par or underweight or something, then I can see getting slammed, but for a pill being broken up? Come on, that&#039;s a little nit picky if you ask me..

				I hear ya chronicpain but I disagree, a little. Let me explain myself.<br />Pills break, fact of life. Everyone knows it. I&#039;ve had things break before (bars). Everyone has. The vendor probably is honest. Just had bad luck. Poor packaging or maybe an enthusiastic postal workers throwing stuff around. All the above. Any combo of things. Who knows. Point is that the pill(s) broke. :(&nbsp; Not the buyers fault. <br /><br />The way the buyer intended to use is irrelevant. The buyer didn&#039;t want to buy something in pieces. They bought a whole they deserve a whole. Get what you pay for. <br /><br />What do you do if you purchase something from a store, you get it home and upon closer inspection you see it&#039;s damaged. Ripped or whatever. Not 100% what you thought. What do you do? You take it back to the store and get another one or your money back. Keep your receipts. Lol. Say you lost your receipt. Now what?<br /><br />The store won&#039;t except it back. You are S.O.O.L. Sh*t out of luck. So you do the only other thing besides boycotting as a consumer you can do. Bitch and complain. Call the 1800 number. I suspect that&#039;s what happened.<br /><br />The buyer felt slighted. The vendor didn&#039;t deliver on quality or product. There is no store to go to. No manager to speak with. There is no 1800 number to call. So the buyer did what they did. Bitched and complained. Right or wrong. There it is. <br /><br />I will say that some buyers need to chill the F out. Geez! Really. Patience and some understanding would be nice. As a vendor I am here FOR YOU! I want your money! I work hard. You want my product. Don&#039;t be an asshat! What are you going to do when all the vendors are gone and you have to go to the corner for your fix?&nbsp; Ya. I remember those days. FUCK THAT!! SR is better for everyone. Don&#039;t muck it up! Be kind :) It will go a long way. <br />

				I just want to point out that Im not the vendor or buyer that I posted about.. In my eyes if the vendor does everything in his power to deliver the product the other issues are totally out of the vendors hands. Especially with pharmaceuticals, you know exactly what you are going to get, its not like molly or weed where quality, etc can vary widely...<br /><br />Sending small, fragile pills in the mail is fragile. Most pills will make it just fine, but yea, you are right, the post office mishandles stuff and because of the nature of the items make it difficult to have every one make it without blemish.<br /><br />In my opinion, if the vendor does everything, ie. use bubble pack, etc to make the delivery as best as possible is the only thing he/she can do. But for a vendor to get a 3/5 is a little too far.<br /><br />One time, I received OC 80&#039;s from a legit pharmacy, legit script, etc but when i got them I was 33 pills short. When I called the pharmacy and Fedex I was out of luck, nothing no body could do. Here, if someone claims a missing pill more than likely the vendor will make it&nbsp; up, so most vendors here are actually better than real world or legit businesses.<br /><br />But on the other hand, if the vendor didn&#039;t take all the precautions, misrepresented the product or whatever, then ding him. But a vendor can only do so much.&nbsp; I have had pills end up being broken when delivered, not many,&nbsp; but its happened, l was fortunate to have understanding buyers.<br /><br />All im saying is that a vendor shouldn&#039;t be dinged when he has done everything in his power to deliver what was promised. maybe it should be mentioned in the info area but to ding his numbers is un called for..&nbsp; I wish I could have&nbsp; got my 33 oc 80&#039;s back from the pharmacy or fedex, I had absolutely no recourse. <br /><br />Im sorry, but I would never ding a vendor if the pills came crushed, I knew it had to be the post offices fault. A simple comment would have sufficed or maybe give him a 4/5

				If you could see the machinery that processes mail you&#039;d never be surprised that things arrive crushed.&nbsp; In this particular vendor&#039;s case I would disregard the &quot;3 of 5&quot; rating and the complaints about broken product.&nbsp; Some buyer&#039;s will just never be happy. <br /><br />i just got an order from this vendor a few hours ago and I&#039;m quite happy.&nbsp; ;D

				Amma have to agree here. A 3/5 for an issue that is pretty much entirely out of the vendor&#039;s control is a bit harsh. I mean you order an anvil, you know it will be whole, you order delicate china for mum&#039;s coffee table, you half-expect something to be broken. If you order tabs and you know they will be mailed letter what do you expect?<br /><br />If everything else was okay like quality and speed of delivery a simple comment would have sufficed imho....
