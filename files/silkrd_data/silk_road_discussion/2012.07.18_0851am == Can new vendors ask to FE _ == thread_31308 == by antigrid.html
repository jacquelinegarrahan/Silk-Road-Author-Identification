				I am somewhat confused after reading the rules on SR for vendors, which state that new vendors cannot ask buyers to finalize early until they have had 35 sales, and that they will have their selling privliges revoked if they ask before then. With that said, I have seen a lot of vendors asksay in their profile that buyers must finalize early if they are first time buyers, new buyers, or ordering a large order. I believe some of these vendors were new so I am somewhat confused. <br /><br />Can I stipulate, as a new vendor, that certain buyers need to finalize early even though I do not yet have 35 transactions? I do not want to loose my seller account, but I also want to protect myself. I would only ask those to FE which are mentioned in my profile, such as first time buyers, and large orders. I would not surprise a buyer by sending them a message asking to finalize early if they were not a part of the group I had mentioned in my profile. Just want to be sure it is ok to do this.

				It&#039;s a rule they don&#039;t really enforce, because it&#039;s too much of a bitch to do so. That being said, they shouldn&#039;t be requiring FE ever, let alone with weak vendor stats. I believe once you have 50-100 transactions you should be able to ASK that your buyers FE.

For the most part as long as everyone is happy I do not interfere with the vendors politics. If I see a profile that sets off too many red flags to me I&#039;ve been know to point out these issue that break the Silk Road guidelines and 6 out 10 times that vendor account is either banned or put under investigation within 24 hours.<br /><br />I am the moderator that looks at everything from the buyers point of view by my own choice. I do this because the buyers suffer more on Silk Road than the vendors. If you don&#039;t believe me ask me if almost a million dollars worth of buyers money was stolen from them in the past year. This is the reason finalizing early in my opinion shouldnt be allowed for any reason. It is Silk Road policy if something goes wrong in a transaction that the btc are split 50/50 so each side is treated equally. Finalizing early is not needed no matter what a vendor says. They want it for a number of reasons but once a buyer finalizes early he gives up all Silk Road&#039;s responsibility in the transaction and opens all kinds of doors that lead to problems.<br /><br />Finalizing early is the number one scam on Silk Road currently and basically allows the vendor to do whatever they want in the situation and they generally will never refund anything. While we are talking about it the next vendor I hear about holding orders ransom until the buyer finalizes early be prepared to not only get annoyed the piss out of by me but will also automatically have their account put on suspension most likely while under investigation. I&#039;m sick of bully vendors and lame scam tricks. Any vendor that care to contact me on why they must have finalization early I will explain in very common sense why their reason is bullshit.<br /><br />So does everyone understand what Mr. Bloodbath has posted here?<br />Since an admin left for a new stage in his life this week, I feel It is my duty to the community to steer it towards a more honest and safe community. Wanna try me see if I dont get shit on my shoes.<br /><br />I&#039;ve invested too may volunteer hours into this community to watch this new generation of buyers be taken advantage of like I&#039;ve seen in the last few weeks. Buyers and vendors my PM box is always open and encouraged to use.<br /><br />My advice to OP and other new vendors start out slow don&#039;t try to build an empire in a day, those are the vendors that usually will have many problems during their time at Silk Road.<br /><br />For those that don&#039;t agree with what I have said...do not have the community in their best interest.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />:)<br />nomad bloodbath

				Well put nomad, i know who i&#039;m contacting next when a vendor tries to make me FE before shipping. =D To the OP make sure you have dcns for all orders. <br /><br />This way when someone tries to get away with free product you can just present the dcn in the resolution center. If you have dcns on all your orders you shouldn&#039;t <br /><br />have to worry about getting scammed. Just make sure you outline your refund policy on your vendor page.
