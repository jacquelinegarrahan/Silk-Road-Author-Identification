				After several purchases and over 10 products brought and tested, i&nbsp; have come to the conclusion that SR and most of its vendors are not legit (fake). The only authentic product was a knuckle duster. The rest, which include H, speed, prescription drugs, these were all bogus! And im sick of wasting 100&#039;s of BTC! WTF?!?

				Hm.&nbsp; That&#039;s funny.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had over 16 transactions, and every drug I&#039;ve received is purer and at a better price for its quality than anything I&#039;ve ever obtained IRL.&nbsp; Perhaps you&#039;re buying from the wrong vendors?&nbsp; Or trolling?

				Well here is the place to name and shame SilentVoice. How about some names and links to the vendors feedback page showing where you have left negative feedback. To have had the failure rate that you say you have experienced leads me to suspect that you have not done any research prior to buying, and as the saying goes &quot;buyer beware&quot;.

				Go to the rumor mill section of the forums, in the stickies is a thread on legit H vendors, look at the first post but also look at the last few posts to get more recent reviews.

				You can&#039;t be a victim if you deliberately keep going back. This site isn&#039;t about rainbows and unicorns of such honesty. As a buyer you&#039;re suppose to research, lurk and get as much information as you can before you purchase. It never ends good if you just pick the first vendor you see as the fastest and cheapest way to seek your drug or anything else.

				Hmm, 40 purchases, all but 3 were authentic products.<br /><br />SR is not a con.<br /><br />Unless everyone on the forum is part of a 100+ scamming team&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Thing is many times we warn of bad products or bad vendors.<br /><br />Maybe thats just the part that makes the scam seem legit.<br /><br />lol<br /><br />The vendors I deal with are good at what they do and they sell top produce.<br /><br />And H addicts are always working up sob stories. <br /><br />If my first purchase off SR would have been rubbish I would have left quickly.<br /><br />I studied the MDMA forums and found a UK seller with every user saying it was fantastic.<br /><br />So I bought a gram.<br /><br />It was fantastic!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Still got like 400mg left.

				Hhahahahah!&nbsp; ;D<br />Like others have said, never received bunk. I must be part of the forum conspiracy, and we&#039;re all lying. <br />I&#039;ve yet to get bunk, or ripped off. You keep getting ripped off, seems to be operator error, and not the machine. <br /><br />On the other side of the troll.....you have all these purchases, but most of your posts are on this one thread.....why didn&#039;t you cry wolf sooner? And how can you not remember the other vendors? go to your page and look at who you left feedback for. then tell us, so we can check their feedback and verify your negative comments and low ratings. I think you posted this as a buffer for your next orders, so you can claim they are bunk and get yuor coins back. Your game is out played,find a new one. <br />Bumo me a negative Karma while you&#039;re at it, too, cause you&#039;re a dumb cunt, or a dumb liar...both are pathetic.

				Sorry, don&#039;t wish to offend you but I have bought quite a few times off Afghan, and hes a good guy, can&#039;t fault him. His stuff is always been top quality even if a bit expensive. His oxycodone, oxycontin is definitely legit. Also if it was so bad, why did you order 3 more items from him??

				Hey guys, noticing the ram on AA and his wares............ <br /><br />Well i suppose i may be the definitive voice....&nbsp; Drugs are so specific to individuals and about a million variables (at least 10) and it the same as with all products, usually as in 99% of cases NO one comments, as most dont when they are SATISFIED...<br /><br />only when its either a exceptionaly good or same in bad.. do most actually come to forums..... unless your a blogger (which although growing is only a small perportion of this community) <br /><br />In reality, for the ammount of transactions completed BY AA, its less than 0.001% dissatisfied.....&nbsp; Considering AA runs full time store (million other commitments, he never forgets his friends)

				No i have never used oxy before, im relatively new to H and OC, but i have done my research, so i know all about the effects of opiates. <br /><br />There is one thing that i should mention.....i have a liking of tramadol, although my consume is rather low i.e&nbsp; x10 50mg. I understand that this is a rather weak opiate, i dont think this should&nbsp; have an impact on my tolerance whilst on H. I snorted .5g of brown in one sitting, the feeling wasnt anything special, unlike the great buzz i get off of x4 tramadols.<br /><br />I also took all of the 10 5g OC in a seperate sitting, only to feel a buzz equivalent to x1 30mg co-codomol.<br /><br />Im sure that my tramadol seeking of&nbsp; x10 50mg hgasnt, nor will interupt the buzz from H, although i could be wrong, if so then i have a lot of apologising to do.<br /><br />It doestnt matter if it lablled &#039;Street Speed&#039;, its should still be of a high quality.<br /><br />My repetertive orders from AA was due to being unaware of the potency of each drug, hence i started low, then increased to the hard stuff, only to reveal the lameness of it.
