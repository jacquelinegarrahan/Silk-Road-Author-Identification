				Hello!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this is the most recent or most popular thread concerning these websites, but I just searched &quot;Sheep&quot; and found it, so sorry if I&#039;m posting in a dead thread. I just wanted to say that I&#039;ve been checking out Sheep (after several failed attempts to connect to BMR) and I&#039;m definitely considering using it. I intend to take a hiatus from the online drug scene, just to be safe, but if Sheep is around when I feel comfortable enough to return I think that&#039;s where I&#039;ll go. I like the setup of the place &amp; I&#039;ll probably set up a new vendor account there before too long. I&#039;d love to hear more feedback about Sheep from the community though, too.<br /><br />XOXO<br />PM90

				Same boat here. No going to rush into anything. <br /><br />I may as well take this time to say to all customers that there is nothing to worry about from our side. We keep NOTHING and use self made OS&#039;s and every possible &#039;layer&#039; we can add over that. We take security are main priority and everything else is secondary bar nothing. Without security there is nothing! Period! <br /><br />PGP should be mandatory for a while at least as there is a lot of speculation and just crazy talk. DPR got caught been lax in security in the real world, Not online so we can take from this if we can get a few sites that everyone can verify to be legit we will only be back bigger and stronger than ever before. They can not win there war on us as we have the truth on our side! <br /><br />generalm3sS...... signing off.....<br /><br />Peace

				I&#039;ve not used either yet, but I&#039;m completely shocked that sheep is even in the running when.... it uses no escrow!? That just makes me want to go running in the opposite direction. You&#039;re just supposed to trust random people with your money? Sounds like all kinds of trouble. However, if you check the sticky threads you can read which reputable SR vendors are setting up shop there and their profile name. I&#039;d feel okay using sheep + a reputable ex SR vendor. But anyone else on there... with no escrow... nope.<br /><br />What a shitty depressing time this is. SR dead, BMR down for maintenance, sheep apparently having technical issues, my last bag of weed running dangerously low and knowing that even if I could order right now, it would be several days away before I got it, and I can&#039;t even order anywhere.
