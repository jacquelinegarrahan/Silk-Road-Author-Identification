				You can use Tails to create a LiveUSB--Applications --&gt; Tails --&gt; Tails USB Installer --&gt; Clone and Install.<br /><br />Once it&#039;s on USB, boot into your LiveUSB, and go to Tails --&gt; Configure Persistent Volume.&nbsp; This creates an Truecrypt encrypted partition on the USB stick that sits alongside the main LiveUSB parition.&nbsp; Then, you would can just create a private key like you normally would through the gnome keyring, and it will remain on your USB, and be persisted each time you boot from it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was wondering the same thing when I first started using Tails, as they originally didn&#039;t have that functionality, and I had to copy over my private key, which I had saved on a seperate encrypted USB, each time I wanted to place an order or send an encrypted message.

Thank goodness for Guru - he patiently walked me through it.<br /><br />I&#039;m speaking as a complete Linux-noob, so I&#039;m going to type this out the way I&#039;d want someone to show me. So yeah, not so technical.<br /><br />At the top left of your screen you see a red swirl, Applications, Places, System. <br />Click on System.<br />Under preferences you&#039;ll see &quot;password and encryption&quot;. Click on it. You will be required to generate a new key for yourself before you can import anyone else&#039;s. I may have made that up, but it seems that I had to. Then just copy their PGP key and paste it in the open window where you generated your key. That&#039;s the first part.<br /><br />Under the red swirl, select Accessories and then gedit Text Editor. Type your business in there. Under edit, select Encrypt. You will then see a list of PGP keys you have. Select the box with the one you want, and hit enter. Boom - it&#039;s encrypted and you&#039;re done. <br /><br /><br />Oh, if you want to save all these after you shut down, you&#039;ll have to create a partition (it&#039;ll save some data to your USB key, to be unlocked with a password upon starting up). I can&#039;t remember how off-hand, but it&#039;s not that tough. <br /><br />

				Is the LiveUSB with a persistent partition insecure in some way that I don&#039;t know of?&nbsp; <br /><br />Is there a benefit of manually backing up the keyring, rather than using the Tails bulit-in persistent drive to back up the keyring (and your home folder, etc.)?

				Ahh I gotcha, Guru.&nbsp; Thanks for clearing that up.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Backing up the whole keyring...I originally had only backed up my secret key, and would re-add any public keys from other users as I needed them.&nbsp; I guess backing up the whole keyring would have saved me some time...<br /><br />But, like you said, the USB persistent partition works fine for me, so I&#039;m gonna stick with that.&nbsp; <br /><br />On a more general note, Gustono, always make sure you are using the lastest version of Tails.
