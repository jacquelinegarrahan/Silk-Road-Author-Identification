				UPDATE:&nbsp; Quite a few people sending deposits from mtgox.com have not received theirs because of problems on mtgox&#039;s side.&nbsp; If a deposit from mtgox is not showing up, please check the block chain at:<br />https://blockexplorer.com/address/(youraddresshere)<br />to see if the deposit was even sent.&nbsp; If not, you need to message mtgox about it.<br /><br />CORRECTION:&nbsp; Please message us on the MAIN site via the contact us link, not here on the forums.<br /><br />Many of the deposits that were sent to the site this week have not been properly credited to the depositors accounts.&nbsp; We don&#039;t have a good way to automatically figure out where the deposits should go, so we are having to process them manually.&nbsp; If you made a deposit that is taking longer than about six hours to show up, just send us the address the deposit was sent and the amount of the deposit and we&#039;ll be able to track it down and credit your account.<br /><br />Also, to be on the safe side, you should only use newly generated addresses from your account page from now on.&nbsp; We generated a new address for every account, so the one currently on your account page should be good.<br /><br />There have been a few strange instances where people&#039;s deposits ended up in other users&#039; accounts, so we&#039;ve disabled withdrawals and transfers until everyone has a chance to claim their deposits.&nbsp; If you got a deposit that wasn&#039;t yours, please let us know so we can get it to the right account.<br /><br />Cheers&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				Hmm, I think there may be problems with even the new addresses. I sent 100 coins from mtgox and 20 from my own wallet to the currently listed address on my account page, they have over a dozen confirmations, but no sign of them yet. <br /><br />I sent SR a message on the site about it, hopefully he is able to dig out from under all of this, sounds like a huge pain in the ass.

				Hey man, if S.R. finds my funds I&#039;m gonna be hella fuckin happy, not just regular kind happy! :D<br />I purchased my btc on wednesday (which is also wen they were lost)<br />my 100btc that WAS worth about $250 USD is NOW worth about $320 USD! <br />I may have accidentally made a really lucky investment! I hope the prices DO keep going up! lol<br /><br />no but seriously, i emailed SilkRoad, dont expect to hear back for awhile, which is understandable.<br />also, i have no fucking idea what wallet i sent it to cuz i used fucking INSTAWALLET.<br />does anybody know of a silkroad deposit address with the word &quot;fag&quot; in the middle of it?<br />i seriously think the one i sent it to had the word &quot;fag&quot; in it...<br />time will tell! <br />any techy peoples know if theres any different info i could give s.r. to help him find my btc if i dont know the address?<br /><br />~smod

				did you access the instawallet through TOR? if not, the instawallet link will be in your history. you can then paste your instawallet address into the block explorer, and MAYBE it will show you the address those coins were sent to (as long as it was done quickly, I think it would use the same coins to send to the SR address) but as instawallet is also a mixer, it might not list the sent to address.<br /><br />Or when using instawallet to send coins, check the GREEN ADDRESS check box, then your coins will be sent from this address, 1CDysWzQ5Z4hMLhsj4AKAEFwrgXRC8DqRN and you could scour through block explorer to find the address you sent it to (and for $320, I could scour for a LONG time) Knowing the Time it happened and transferings strange ammounts will also help you follow your transactions. there are a lot of 100BTC transfers, but not a whole lot of 99.78454124 transfers. I hope you do locate your coins.<br /><br /><br />best of luck<br />®eptile

				when using instawallet, always check the green address option, and don&#039;t send even amounts. then you can see the transfer easily on block explorer by checking the instawallet green address for your oddball amount e.g. 99.9785 instead of 100. that makes your transfer stand out a bit, but only to someone who knows the actual amount you sent.

				Here&#039;s a useful tip for how to NOT use Instawallet: a few days ago I transferred some coins from an Instawallet account to SR.&nbsp; After I had clicked &quot;Send&quot; the page refreshed &amp; saw my new balance (the original balance minus the coins I had just sent).<br /><br />I then hit the refresh button on the browser and bam! the same amount of coins were again sent, in spite of the fact that the &quot;Amount&quot; field was blank &amp; there was no receiving address.&nbsp; For a few hours I worried that some of my coins had just vanished into space, &#039;cause you know that seems to happen with Bitcoins...&nbsp; A few hours after the initial transaction had shown up the second, unintended transaction, also showed up. <br /><br />Moral: don&#039;t hit the refresh button on your browser just after you&#039;ve sent a few coins from Instawallet.

				Excellent follow-up on the part of SR for tracking down and crediting my missing deposit. I will surely donate some BTC&#039;s for the cause.

				As others have suggested the block explorer is your friend in these situations.. it can at least help you figure out who you need to complain to :)
