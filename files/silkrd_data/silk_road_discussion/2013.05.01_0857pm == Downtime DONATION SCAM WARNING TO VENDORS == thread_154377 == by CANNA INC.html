				these guys are really adaptive with their scams. just remember SR will never send you any btc adresses. hope this isn&#039;t a repost.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Greetings and thank you for supporting Silk Road! <br /><br />I must apologize for the downtime this week. We have been under an elaborate DDOS attack but we believe we have fixed the issue, for the time being. We will overcome these issues, but in the meantime please update your emergencies addresses.<br /><br />The problem is rooted within the tor hidden service code, the part of the tor project we rely on, that simply put has not gotten the attention it needs.<br /><br />Here is how you can help, DONATE TO THE TOR PROJECT<br />https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en<br /><br />Tor project does not accept bitcoin donations, so if you want to help out using bitcoins, you can donate to Silk Road. We will use these funds to hire programmers to improve the hidden service code in the ways that will immediately help Silk Road performance and stability. <br /><br />1Gg96cs5s8CGCmevgWRcW5qLTxpFP7y1G4<br /><br />Your faithful servant,<br />SR Staff<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />username was &quot;Announcements&quot;

				I think it&#039;s shameless that people would try to capitalize off of the Silkroad and the good will of members. That being said if anyone wants to help some starving children in Africa....13NKPShwrwjyYL47JYiji4jTyZUUsaTPv3 (Children receiving donations may not be African, starving, or children)

				Haha. &quot;Announcements&quot;. Have you all noticed that these scams are getting less and less creative by the day? Each one is a copy/paste of the previous one, and just a different BTC addres. Fucking hilarious.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made this suggestion before and will make it again... hope the powers that be are listening.. but it would make sense to have a &quot;Report&quot; button under messages that will automatically flag a message that is suspect and maybe send an alert to the concerned party who deal with it (instead of waiting for many complaints to start trickling in). And maybe if 5 or more people &quot;Report&quot; a username within the span of a certain time period, they get temporarily blocked from sending shit? I dunno the feasibility of that?. My 2 cents...

				Yes I agree these are incredibly sad attempts<br /><br />Reality is people are falling for them. We got to warn as fast as possible, because even if its not my money, the fact that these people are making anything off this BS is annoying enough. <br /><br />SR WILL NEVER SEND YOU AN EXTERNAL BTC ADDRESS

We had a scam attempt after the Boston bombing attack mentioning SilkRoad was opening a separate fund to donate to the victims. That one I felt was very disgusting, capitalizing on terror...<br /><br />Anyways, we receive about one of these a week. I don&#039;t think any vendors are falling for it, most probably the scammer is passing a few coins through. I would do it, to make it look somehow legit and functioning. <br /><br />Poor people...poor people...
