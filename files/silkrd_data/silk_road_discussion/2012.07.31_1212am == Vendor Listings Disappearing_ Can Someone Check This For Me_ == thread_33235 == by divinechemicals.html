				I already posted this in Technical Support, I&#039;m posting it here to see if I&#039;m the only with this problem. I would be very appreciative if someone could visit the profiles of the three vendors below and tell me if they have any listings up. I feel like I&#039;m going insane<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay, this issue is making me think that I have gone crazy.<br /><br />1. Last night I was looking at Rocker&#039;s profile, he had his usual stock of shrooms. All are gone today. I chocked up that to coincidence, maybe I just missed him.<br />2. I was looking at ManaFromHeaven&#039;s shrooms. Listings were up. Two minutes later I go back and they are all down. I literally just pressed the back key to go back to him.<br />3. I go to shroomin1&#039;s shrooms. Once again, he has listings. Same thing, I press the back key once to get back to him and all his listings are down. Again, I just looked less than five minutes ago and there were listings.<br /><br />So now I&#039;m starting to think that I&#039;m not just going crazy, and maybe there is a technical issue going on here? Please advise. Thank you.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Update: I messaged MFH and he said that he just sold out, so maybe this really all was a weird coincidence that drove me insane.

				Yep I pulled my listings due to the exchange rate madness. I&#039;m sure most vendors who were online at the time did. I will be returning them shortly.
