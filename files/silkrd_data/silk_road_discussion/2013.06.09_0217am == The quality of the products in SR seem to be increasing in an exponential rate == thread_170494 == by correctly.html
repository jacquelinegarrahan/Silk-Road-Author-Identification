				i wouldnt say the quality of heroin was getting better just the opposite . i dont know if when the vendors are new they try to put out the best they can then once they have been on for a few months and built up a customer base, they start to let their standards drop . and lets face it the price we pay on silk road for H it should be at least 50 per cent pure not 15 just better than the stuff i would buy on the street for a lot less

				I think some people prefer liquid LSD because it&#039;s somehow closer to the raw stuff. It&#039;s one step &#039;up the chain&#039;.<br /><br />There is probably less loss of potency than with blotters, which frequently are mishandled (exposure to heat/light/etc). But it all depends on the people working with it I guess. From my experience most of the liquid seems to be of higher purity than the average batch of blotters. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s true in your case Tesselated, since I know you&#039;re one person who takes this seriously and seem to provide SR with lots of good acid. But still...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The fact that tabs are handled by many people as they go down the line and are exposed to air obviously degenerates the chemicals much more than liquid in a bottle goes through. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree it&#039;s a pain in the ass to ship haha, I&#039;m still looking for a good method.

				I&#039;ve had a few experiences with liquid L before. I&#039;ve never had a vial but the person I got it from had the vial and would drop it and let it dry just before I got it from him, usually on sweetarts. It was always quite potent, but similar to blotter in effects. There was one time where I got some liquid from him that was on a sugarcube and it was one of the most unique trips to date. It was certainly LSD, no doubt, but the visuals and the euphoria were unlike any other trip and I felt more lucid than I had during previous trips. I mentioned this to him and he said good liquid L usually has that different feel from blotter in that it&#039;s more of a euphoric feel good high instead of a &#039;trip&#039;. <br /><br />I&#039;m curious what other people have experienced and if this matters that it is liquid or if the difference is likely just the crystal/potency.
