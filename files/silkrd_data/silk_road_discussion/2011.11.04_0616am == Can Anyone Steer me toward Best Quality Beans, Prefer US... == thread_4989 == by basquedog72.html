				Hi,<br />I think all the good beans have been gone for a while, I live in mid west U.S., and haven&#039;t had good ones since last summer.&nbsp; I tried 1g of Molly&nbsp; and it was WEAK as hell, my first time trying it and I felt it peak up but just never kicked in all the way.&nbsp; <br /><br />I want to order US and avoid Customs paranoia, only two US suppliers selling the beans, but neither have any reviews.&nbsp; Advice greatly appreciated!!!

				pretty much the pills in America are shit, except for the Chicago area where there are &quot;mints&quot;, but no one sells those on here.&nbsp; Any good pill is going to have to come from over seas, I hear good things about Brown Rolex&#039;s from streetpharmacy.&nbsp; Also pillow talk and Dr Amsterdam seem to decent reviews.&nbsp; &nbsp;For some reason pills are harder to get across the ocean.&nbsp; You could always get some molly from Europe from AAkovin or Mitonix, both are supurb vendors.

				I wouldn&#039;t bother with US sellers but you can be 97% certain ordering molly from a pro canadian seller. You shouldn&#039;t have any customs issues with a shipment Dopeboy and his shit is bomb.

				Gumby is right. Everything around these parts is shit. If you want anything good you have to order from overseas. Mitanox/dramsterdam for MDMA, and streetpharmacy and his brown rolex from Germany. Both have great service, shipping,and product. Don&#039;t waste your time with domestic molly. all we offer is weed, and pharmaceuticals.
