				Hello all of SR,<br /><br />Happy to be on the road! In just one week I have learned all I can about browsing anonymously, using pgp, etc.<br /><br />I have placed an order two days ago, used pgp, and now waiting for the order to be shipped ...<br /><br />My concern is... <br />I am a brand new buyer and I hope my order does not get canceled, <br />and also my username on SR is different than my forum handle, should i worry?<br /><br />I have recently placed an order with shroomMan(100)<br />under SR name Trihkstur636<br /><br />any advice appreciated, peace

				Why would your order get cancelled? As long as your first one isn&#039;t something ridiculously incriminating you should be fine. What does your order status say?

				Dude, you asked this another thread already. I tell ya what I told there - <br /><br />don&#039;t you worry &#039;bout a thing<br />cause every lil&#039; thing, gonna be alright.<br /><br />Most orders take at least a week to arrive, just keep cool brother.

				You didn&#039;t mess up broketown (at least not for a newbie&nbsp; ;) ), but you publicly mentioned the vendor that your doubting. <br /><br />Most people check these boards out for exactly the same reason you do - to see how &#039;real&#039; this place is. If they see some vendor&#039;s name associated with negativity that may stay in their memory, even subconsciously. In a business that is already shady enough, vendors hate being associated with &quot;badness&quot;. This is the first place in the history of the western world that making illegal deals has some kind of moral authority - ie. lets keep this place as &#039;legitimate&#039; as possible - honor among thieves as it were - no room for bad businessmen here or anywhere else.&nbsp;

				One of the main reasons that I like sticking to domestic vendors. Buying domestic does have its downsides though.
