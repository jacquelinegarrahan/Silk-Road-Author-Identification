				Hi everyone. was just wondering whats the best (easiest) way to get Bitcoins in the UK. All the simple ways seem to be American only. Cant we go to Western Union or is that just for Europe and the US? Thanks for any information anyone can give me.

				Thanks guys much appreciated. I&#039;m still pretty new to this. just wondered if there was anywhere i could take a wad of cash and get some sort of voucher number without having to hand over bank details (like taking money to the money shop or western union and changing it for a e-money voucher if such a system existed). Once again thanks your advice is very much appreciated.

				Use localbitcoins.com and meet up with the person. <br /><br />You will pay more though then through mt-gox but a wad of tenners in a coffee shop is pretty anonymous and no traces.<br /><br />I use it all the time.

				I used to use Intersango but they had too many problems with UK deposits and it was slow.<br /><br />I found that Blockchain.info lets you Pingit directly from your phone. Takes seconds for the funds to show up as bitcoins.

				You can buy UKASH vochers, then just give the code to me or other vendors who have a similiar service on SR. Theres a small fee but its easy enough. Best to do it on the main site though, doing buisness on here can lead to scams and your not protected. Just do some research on here and be safe!<br />:)<br />Dont use intersango they dont do U.K deposits like a lot of people.<br />Theres local bitcoins.<br />Just dont mention SR to people

				Go to BTCxUK. You pay no fees and get your coins within hours of making a payment. Bets I could find. <br />You still have to arrange a rate that could be better than some local coins thing. Also proper legit company never let me down.<br />I looked at all the ways bitinstant local coins. And for UK, these people BTCxUK seem to be the best.<br />Website not great but its a basic page of info. Just follow it and arrange your BTC via tormail.<br /><br />http://64d7qoqgjcw47vvz.onion

				Yep, I can confirm BTCxUK is a very good way to get BTC in the UK. Have done 2 transactions with him where I sent him money late at night and the BTC has been in my account by the time I&#039;ve woken up the following day. Coms and rates have been very good as well.<br />Number one choice for sure.

				Hi - I have been using bitstamp.net (which accepts SEPA transfer direct from my bank account) - it a bit more expensive BUT way quicker; from deciding to buy coins through to having them ready to use on SR can be done the same day, taking about 3/4 hours (if it is a business day - and not at night as the bank seem to manually do the SEPA transfer). Definitely recommended.
