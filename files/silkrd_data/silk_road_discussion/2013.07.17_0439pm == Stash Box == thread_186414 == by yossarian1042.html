				Best one I had seen was made from a wooden cigar box. They divided it with some wood from the hobby store so they had a place for small baby jars of bud and papers/pipes, then on part of it they put a mirror and some silk screen to catch the kief.<br /><br />Wooden Cigar boxes are designed to have an air tight seal to hold in the moisture and tend to be lined with Spanish ceder which helps maintain a steady humidity inside the box.

Wrap your stuff in them and find a good hiding spot for your stash. They are the latest safety method for shipping by sellers these days to beat sniffer dogs

				Get a mason jar, you don&#039;t have to get the huge quart ones.&nbsp; They make nice little shorties, a 4 pack for like 3 or 4 bucks at Walmart.&nbsp; Here is the key.&nbsp; Have alcohol or alcohol swabs. I prefer alcohol in a spray bottle.&nbsp; After you put in or take out dank, just wipe the seal on the lit and around the top edge where the seal hits.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t expect to be in and out a dozen times a day or you want to hide it for a bit, spray the whole thing, sealed of course, down with 91% alcohol, wipe well and you are pretty good.&nbsp; For long term storage, just do multiple layers of vacuum sealing. <br /><br />Hope my experience helps.

				You can go to walmart and buy a portable safe for about 35$.&nbsp; For small amounts/things that don&#039;t smell, puzzle boxes are really nice :) Depending on how you feel about security, you might want to get one that is nearly impossible to open without knowing the combination.
