				What is the best way to do it in the US?&nbsp; I usually do a cash deposit from my branch bank for amounts less than $4000 but what happens when I eventually want to do it for amounts more than $10,000.&nbsp; It&#039;s my understanding that transactions in cash start to get scrutinized by the government as they approach $10,000+<br /><br />Would one have to do InstaGram from a CVS or 7-Elevent?&nbsp; The max you can do is $9999 if I remember correctly.&nbsp; You would have to use a fake ID at multiple locations to do that.<br /><br />Any ideas?&nbsp; I&#039;m starting to realize that turning cash into BTC can be more difficult once you start talking $10,000+ on a regular basis.&nbsp; InstaGram or whatever it&#039;s called is time-consuming as well, but my bank branch definitely keeps track of my identity by having me swipe my card.

				FYI, a $9999 one will be flagged by AML because it is an attempt to come in just under the $10,000 limit. <br /><br />Best bet is to do regular deposits of the same amount, say $2000 every week on Friday. Looks like you are making payments for something and you can store your bitcoin in your wallet tell you get to 10k or however much you want to deposit.<br /><br />

				I would definitely recommend splitting your purchase into at least 2 smaller purchases of not more than <br />$5,000 each. You are correct in that authorities scrutinize larger $10K purchases much more than amounts under that. However, its important to note that all bank employees are encouraged to report transactions of any amount that appear suspicious. <br />

				Can you get the people who are paying you all the cash now, to just start paying you directly in Bitcoin?<br />If not,&nbsp; why not?

				Buy 4000 USD from one exchange, 3000 from 2 others. Take all those BTC and then converge them into BTC Fog or wallet if ya not bothered over a series of E-wallets, wash them and then send direct to SR. <br /><br />SHA-TING!

				You could also try to find a person near you who wants to sell for 10k$ through https://localbitcoins.com/.

				The best possible way is to know someone who has tons of coins, and is looking to sell them. There are Bitcoin communities that you can join, and I guaranty if you put the effort in, you will find someone. Transactions like this are done based solely on trust. OTC is your friend! <br /><br />http://bitcoin-otc.com/
