				Hey i get my goods sent to my home address, Now other people do use friends address or something like that... But IMO you should hve it shipped to you.. I also do purchases and sales though ebay so pCKAGES coming to me all the time is nothing new..But dont make a fake name when u give you details to the vendor, almost all mail dropers Know the name on the address and if they see your address look and see some wild name it may look a little funny..But it has been done, i admit i did it in my early days.. So yea i would suggest mailing it to where you are.. This is my suggestion though the final thought is yours, but iv been doing this for a whle no issues...(Knock on wood)! Hope you have a good 1st transaction...NO WAORRIES....Specialy if its small, if your ordering a kilo or a pound id be a tad nervous..Other than that. Your fine..good luck

				I&#039;m with AA on this one. Hey! AA!&nbsp; I just got that one! - Very clever!<br /><br />I too, have been a big ebayer, and get a lot of CD&#039;s and vinyl from Japan. So it&#039;s not unusual to see some pretty strange looking packages come my way. <br /><br />It also depends on where you live. What kind of people live near you, ie: neighbors who may have sticky fingers! <br /><br />Never forget &quot;Plausible deniability&quot;.&nbsp; In other words, &quot;How was I supposed to know there were 30 Adderall in there? - I thought it was my new Justin Bieber bobble-head!&quot;<br /><br />Plausible deniability refers to lack of evidence proving an allegation. Standards of proof vary in civil and criminal cases. In civil cases, the standard of proof is &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; whereas in a criminal matter, the standard is &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; If an opponent lacks incontrovertible proof (evidence) of their allegation, one can &quot;plausibly deny&quot; the allegation even though it may be true.<br /><br />Now a Kilogram of Dutch Amphetamine, might be plausible to deny, but you might want to MOVE at that point. Because they gonna be watchin yo ass! LOL!<br /><br />Keep the amounts within reason. If you are ordering bulk to become a vendor. Try and find a friend with a business address. Or someone who works at a job where they get the mail everyday. Something like that. <br /><br />Try taking an empty or crappy DVD in it&#039;s case, and mailing it to yourself, the next time you&#039;re farthest from home. I did that in the beginning, even rubbing different scents on the package before shipping, just to see if the doggies would get it. - Always came in the mail, like anything else.&nbsp; Did it with some stinky skunk weed, from NYC, to upstate near Albany (about 150 miles). It still stunk in my mailbox! LOL!<br /><br />That&#039;s not one of my DOC&#039;s anyway so my deniability was really plausible.
