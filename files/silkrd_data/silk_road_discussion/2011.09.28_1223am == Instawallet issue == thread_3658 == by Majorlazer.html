				Hello,<br /><br />I am looking to use instawallet as a type of tumbler. I have successfully created 2 wallets and deposited funds into them from outside sources. <br /><br />Unfortunately when I try to send funds from one wallet to another I keep getting the error message that I have insufficient funds or the address does not have enough confirmations. <br /><br />I know I have sufficient funds, because I have been able to send the funds from each wallet back to the original source, but I still cannot send between them. Ideally I would be looking to put funds from both of these wallets in a third instawallet before sending them out.<br /><br />Has anyone encountered this problem with instawallet? <br /><br />How do you get &quot;confirmations&quot; for a wallet?<br /><br />If someone could offer some advice or a solution it would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />If there is no solution, would someone be able to suggest another e-wallet to use?<br /><br />I was also going to see what the forums think of using mybitcoin wallets on your own computer to tumble as an alternative?<br /><br />Thank you for your time!

				Odd, I usually only have to wait for 2 confirmations or 20 minutes to send a payment from instawallet.

				It might depend on where you are sending the money from. ExchangeBitcoins need 6 confirmations.
