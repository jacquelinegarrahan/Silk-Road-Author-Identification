				Galindoi sells capsules of galindoi atlantis very cheap. I haven&#039;t ordered from them since like march or april but when I did the product was very strong as far as stones go and their customer service was phenomenal. I&#039;ve yet to see better packaging methods from any other vendor.

				No problem, you&#039;re gonna enjoy the hell out of those. And the free gift that comes with it. I actually did my first order ever with Galindoi, opening that package was like unwrapping the most badass Christmas gift I&#039;ve ever received.

				My first time I ate 12 caps, which was an incredibly intense experience at the time. My usual dose would be around 16 though. I recommend making tea if you are going to do any more than that because all of those caps can do a number on your stomach. I ate 24 of them once and I vomited. <br /><br />I find that stones are a very different trip than Cubensis. You don&#039;t get into that crazy whacked out headspace. You&#039;re actually getting me a little nostalgic though, maybe I&#039;ll place an order with them as well
