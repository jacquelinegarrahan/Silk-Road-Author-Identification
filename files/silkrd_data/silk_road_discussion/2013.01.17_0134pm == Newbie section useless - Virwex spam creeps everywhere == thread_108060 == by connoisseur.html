				They hit hard last night from about 10pm until 4am - we deleted literally hundreds of their threads and maybe 20 or so of their accounts.&nbsp; However, we can&#039;t be on 24/7, so sometimes the spammers get a head start.&nbsp; I&#039;m going back through all of the forums and deleting the posts right now so it should clean it up a bit.&nbsp; :)

It&#039;s the only thing i can think of that is a permanent solution. Of course you will have to also ban the permutations, such as VIR WEX, but its so much easier than one by one

				Well now that the ban function is in the hands of a moderator that can monitor the newbie discussion it should be easy pickings on banning new accounts but it&#039;ll take a little time to get the accounts that are above 50 posts. It&#039;s not an instant solution but the tide is slowly changing and I believe there is a modification to the code that can be added where a ban deletes all posts by the username account. A keyword removal mod might exist i&#039;ve not exactly located one yet but i&#039;ve been trying to find enough solutions to the spam that if used in a rotating defense would be quite discouraging in the effort:reward aspect that might actually end the attacks. Recent chatter among the staff has me positive that we are moving in a better more organized defensive direction. Lately I&#039;ve spent more time on the SMF site than our own forum in a effort to fully grasp all the anti-spamming tech that we actually have on our side of the attacks.<br />Organization and communication seems to be improving on staff&#039;s end of things and I see a more positive year ahead than the end of 2012 which had me feeling overwhelmed and unprepared but with proper research and application of the knowledge available the moral can only improve.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				All they would do is change the name of the scam to a non banded word.<br /><br />The mods here doing good work. It is hard to restrict people on an anonymous network. <br /><br />The only full proof solution would be to block tor completely or sacrifice users privacy which isn&#039;t an option here. <br /><br />I know people are getting angry about the 50 post count thing. Don&#039;t take it personally. In time people get why you have to do that. <br /><br />There are even some better quality topics starting down there. <br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t have a better idea.

				It looks like the spammers figured out all they have to do is make their first 50 posts worth of spam in the newbie forum, then branch out into all the other forums. The current diarrhea of virwex threads were all made by an account within 20 minutes of registering - apparently some 62 posts in a mere 20 minutes.<br /><br />Funny that there&#039;s no limit on how many posts someone can make in a given period of time. This is just begging to be spam fodder.<br /><br />The captchas, while more annoying to figure out, are probably no problem for spammers who just run a BTC faucet where people solve them by the hundreds for 5 cents an hour.<br /><br />In terms of what would actually be useful to stop the spam, how about limiting new accounts to something like 5 posts to existing threads per 24 hours and NO ability to create new threads until 24 hours have passed (and 5 posts/replies have been made). Maybe also limit the ability of any account to create more than 1 new thread per day. Realistically, why would anyone &quot;need&quot; to create more than 1 new thread in a day unless they are spamming or not willing to search other threads where the topic of the new post has probably been answered dozens of times?<br /><br />Does the forum software allow such a change to be made?
