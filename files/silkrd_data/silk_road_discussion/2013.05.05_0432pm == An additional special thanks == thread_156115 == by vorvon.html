				I love everything about this thread.<br /><br />OP is thanking the community for providing him with something that he wanted/needed<br /><br />the marketplace is actually able provide what is needed.<br /><br />the secondary posters gave feedback and re-thanked the OP for thanking the community in the first place<br /><br />and meanwhile as touchthesky said our dear friends in govt are hating the fact that people can succeed in life without their &#039;help&#039;

				That is so awesome that magic mushrooms help with Migraines and Cluster Headaches and who knows what else!!! There is an episode of Drugs inc. about an older Fella who gets crazy cluster headaches and uses mushrooms to keep them away!!! Very happy to see you have found a way to access these things! I feel very fortunate to have this key as well.

				I&#039;m glad this has been a helpful place for you as well. Similarly, after my spouse was denied medical MJ by multiple doctors for her diagnosed Bi-Polar (though they gladly pumped her full of pharmaceuticals which made things worse), I turned to SR over a year ago, for her, and it has changed her life dramatically. So thank you for reminding me how much SR has helped me. Sometimes I take SR for granted.

				fuck the stupid government, their stupid rules and their stupid regulations.<br /><br />Whatever the recreational/medical user may need is available here. If it&#039;s not, make a thread/petition about it and you can bet things are going to get looked at and acted upon here than at your local guberment office.<br /><br />I use doctors for what they are supposed to be used for, medical advice/consultation. I always take their advice with a grain of salt, do my own research and get my own NATURAL meds most of the time.<br /><br />I&#039;m a strong believer that almost everything can be cured without useless bullshit pharms. Though I do admit to using the occasional valium, I&#039;m rather happy to be &quot;hooked&quot; on weed than &quot;hooked&quot; on valium

				I do feel for anyone that has to get pain medications for legitimate pain on SR. The demand for narcotics such as oxycodone and hydrocodone has driven prices up to absurd amounts and has made legitimate access to these extremely tough. I&#039;ve seen people with legitimate injuries or chronic pain given Ibuprofen 800 mg and, if they&#039;re lucky, Tramadol. /soapbox
