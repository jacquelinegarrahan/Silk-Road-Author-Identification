				(Sorry for the wall of text. I don&#039;t blame you if you react with tl;dr.)<br />So I just discovered SR and I have to say: WOW. Haven&#039;t made a purchase yet, but the marketplace looks impressive. <br /><br />However, I&#039;m starting to have the &quot;It&#039;s too good to be true...&quot; reaction at the moment -- I searched the marketplace and found that many vendors require early finalization on sales to new buyers. This worries me, to say the least. Does anyone have any advice on this? Is there a high success rate with this kind of purchase, and if so, from what vendors? I have no problem finalizing early, as I understand that there is just as much risk in vending to a new buyer as there is to buying from vendor and paying up front. I imagine buying from a top rated vendor carries less risk, but I also read that vendors can easily fake reviews. Are these reviews the source of the vendor ranking? If so, doesn&#039;t that render the ranking as meaningless?<br /><br />I would be more than willing to pay a one time or even per-month BTC charge to use the marketplace if that would make vendors less squeamish about selling to me in escrow as a new buyer. I&#039;d also be very willing to opt in to the insurance idea that has been floating around the forums. <br /><br />If a vendor thinks that less than 10 purchases makes me a new buyer, then I may be a new buyer for quite some time, as I don&#039;t plan to buy a lot of goods -- just a once in a while purchase for special occasions. So I might end up having to pre-finalize on the majority of my purchases here. For sure, a marketplace such as this beats trying to find decent product on the streets, and probably far less of a chance of product quality problems, but I just needed to ask these questions before jumping in.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sorry if I seem overly inquisitive, but I&#039;m just trying to understand the whole process and get some advice before I make any purchases. <br /><br />In any event, I look forward to learning more about the community, and becoming an active member in whatever way possible. Thanks in advance for any feedback.

				I wouldn&#039;t finalize early unless it is a really trusted vendor...95+% rating w/ 100+ transactions or so. That should make it easy to avoid most scams. <br /><br />Always research the vendor (search for them here on the forums, read reviews etc) before purchasing.

				I appreciate the quick response. I figured this would be the only way to start -- and you have to start somewhere. I&#039;ll just go with a low quantity from a reputable vendor, and hopefully everything will go smoothly. Or maybe I&#039;ll pay the significant premium for paperchasing&#039;s product considering he does not have this pre-finalize requirement and ships from within the US so there is less chance of loss in transit.<br /><br />Setting up PGP now. Just have to solve the biggest problem next: anonymous delivery point. <br /><br />Will be scouring the forums for more info/reviews. Just thought I&#039;d post my initial concerns. I&#039;m going to try not to ask too many newb-ish questions -- I&#039;m trying to search out answers before I ask any unnecessary questions.<br /><br />Thanks again.

A lot of users who are finalizing early lately have lost their money. Italian Pilot was a fairly reputable seller and on his last batch, he pleaded with all those that order to finalize early. Then he went AWOL. I didn&#039;t finalize early and went into resolution. When resolution came due, he was still AWOL and I got a 100% refund.<br /><br />rusty

				As a member learning more and more every day regarding the amazing SR I also would not recommend finalizing early or going out of the BTC currency. I am one of possibly the lucky few that have trusted my gut and only ventured out of the SR world a couple of times due to bad timing with Intersango who I have found to be incredible to use. I have not been screwed over yet! There is are few vendors that mention Western Union but my sixth sense has prevented me from being too impulsive. Depending on what you are purchasing research the vendor on the forums and PM the very helpful community for advice. <br />I am not sure what your bullshit meter is like in real life but if it is good, trust it!<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m glad to see it&#039;s not just me. I&#039;ll definitely find a vendor willing to use the escrow system for a new buyer. Do you think they might be more willing if I asked them to create a custom listing with a very small quantity? This would certainly reduce the risk for both of us. I&#039;m not looking for large quantities anyway.<br /><br />On the flip side, I don&#039;t blame them if they say no, as they probably make dozens of sales every day for larger amounts. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s often not worth it for them to take the time to create a listing, and then pack and ship a tiny order...
