				Minutes after I posted this, the BitFloor website went offline, FYI. <br /><br />I guess the BitFloor operators wanted all the discounted BTC&#039;s all for themselves, since it is speculated that once Mt.Gox reopens at 11am Japanese time aka 11 pm EST, the value of those same BTC&#039;s dip buyers were able to score for 55-80 today will go up 50-100% almost instantly. <br /><br />Just keeping you all updated on the situation. <br /><br /><br />(+1 for Karma if you appreciate this please)

Besides the volatility to the long term bitcoins value is definitely on an upward trend

				+1 UANDiR1<br /><br />yes the bit coin is still in it&#039;s upward swing still being in it&#039;s infant years. We have experienced a halfing in the block chain reward which drove the value up dramatically to a spike and it was expected to spike then fall back but not back down to below it&#039;s value before the halfing. <br /><br />It was expected to drop back down to around the $50 dollar mark and then to plateau around the $60 to $75 dollar mark. It halfs every 2 years so I hope you guys will be ready for it again in 2015 or 2016. I have talked about this under my other forum names and I wish I could have warned more vendors because they are the ones who are taking the biggest loss. I wish I had held on to every coin I bought since I started buying them when they were $5 per coin. <br /><br />Anyway I am in the learning process as well. Good luck to everyone

				Right before Gox went offline, trades were going back up over the $100 mark. It will bounce back over the next few days, take my word on it. Infact I detect a pulse.. the ticker is moving and I&#039;m seeing trades fly by right now somehow at 103ish. Although their site is down. So who knows what the fuck. Guess their engine started back up, site should be back up soon. Going to be an interesting night/nextfewdays. I am holding my coins. You should do. Or even buy. Do not sell in this artificial panic.

Without the speculators, there would never have been this huge BTC rally. Many of us here are speculators. <br /><br />Anyhow, as for bitfloor, here&#039;s a quote of their status update:<br /><br />/start of quote/&quot;Our servers are experiencing intermittent DDoS attacks. We are trying to resolve the situation for all of our users.<br /><br />If you are coordinating a DDoS attack, please remember that bitcoin companies are not giant multinationals with huge support staff and computers. We are all involved because we want to see bitcoin succeed.&quot;/end of quote/<br /><br /><br />This makes me wonder, why the hell are the hackers attacking BTC exchanges when there are thousands of &quot;better&quot; targets. That&#039;s like robbing a mom and pop shop when there&#039;s a Walmart right around the corner, am I right? Sheesh.

				Ah, I stand corrected. I guess was just letting out a little steam at the &quot;speculators&quot; who I think drove up the prices and then bailed. But thats misplaced. Hell, I appreciate the speculators for pouring money into the BTC world. In some ways I converted to a speculators as well as even though I had a large amount of coins, when BTC values were skyrocketing I bought up more as an &quot;investment&quot;. So I take that back. Long live the speculators :) In fact, I look forward to more coming in so the prices go back up ;)<br /><br />But yes, fuck these non believers and naysayers. I notice lots of them tend to be the ones who are bitter that OTHERS are holding onto significant coins. I think you might agree. And they only hate because the prices are on the rise and they didn&#039;t get in on the action at lower prices.<br /><br />Anyways, I think the reasons for attacking the exchanges are multifold. I also have conspiracy theories as to WHO is behind the attacks. But the bottom line is to spook the confidence of people on the exchange, create panic, drive down prices (so they can pick up coin) etc etc as has been happening last couple days. It pisses me off too man. Then the rest of the world sees BTC as unstable and the infrastructure around it as weak and thinks twice before buying in. Just my opinion though..

Considering the organization Anonymous (a group many here would consider to be super HEROIC) is behind many of the DDOS attacks on the big multinational, and considering Anonymous supports anarchism, one can clearly eliminate them and all other underground hacking groups affiliated with their ideology as possible suspects. Hence, I agree these DDOS attacks on these poor little BTC exchanges definitely seems to be an act committed by bureaucracies supported by large multinational corporations.&nbsp; <br /><br />The big boys don&#039;t like what the big boy&#039;s can&#039;t control.

				ok, its still dropping through..<br />have there been any coverage on the major news sites about this? &quot;Massive drop in BTC value! Sell yours quickly!&quot;<br />&quot;Thousands panic-sell their BTC&#039;s&quot;<br /><br />I really need to buy something today, its an emergency for the weekend..&nbsp; Since i don&#039;t want to spend the coins i bought when they was $12 each, should i go buy twice the amount of BTC as i want to spend (as investment) and then just pay the regular rate for what im buying from now on? (instead of gradually spending my hard earned coins?)<br /><br />no offence on this last comment but on another note, I got a feeling that UANDiR1 ****MIGHT***!!(impossible, no?) be very wrong[or mistaken], or just trying to stop SR users panic selling in order to help him get a chance to spend his coins quicker.<br /><br />what do others reading this thing think?<br />the direction of the DDoS is alarming, couldnt anyone go after them and counterattack? you&#039;d never get anything like this with the world banking system. which i know isnt all its cracked out to be but.. if a &quot;little&quot; DDoS attack can throw off BTC value so much, are they doing it themselves to benefit? (maybe the eur and us banks, to free up some &#039;more&#039; bailout money for themself by the attacks alone, or shaking down the market to buy up all the coins? - this could backfire hideously if left to go on too long)

Don&#039;t know where that came from. <br />The reason I had you on ignore was because you kept PMing me begging me to send you a bitcoin to first start up your bitcoin investment fund, and 2nd because it was your girlfriends birthday and you wanted to buy her MDMA... both things I have zero interest in financing. Although... objective #2 might be open to negotiation depending on a few graphic conditions.<br /><br />Now, regarding your comment on eating &quot;beans&quot;.. I take you mean have I felt the hit on my 160+ bitcoins or so? Not at all. Theyre still right where they belong. And until I cash them out for USD, I haven&#039;t lost a thing. BUT, when BTC hit $225ish or so I cashed out 10 or so to buy some shiny new things.<br /><br />Will have to go back to ignoring you if the begging messages start up again my friend. Good luck.

I had you on ignore, I had to unignore your comment. Why would I be eating tins of bean &quot;again&quot;? I&#039;ve never eaten &quot;tins of beans&quot;. Don&#039;t know where that came from. <br />The reason I had you on ignore was because you kept PMing me begging me to send you a bitcoin to first start up your bitcoin investment fund, and 2nd because it was your girlfriends birthday and you wanted to buy her MDMA... both things I have zero interest in financing. Although... objective #2 might be open to negotiation depending on a few graphic conditions.<br /><br />Now, regarding your comment on eating &quot;beans&quot;.. I take you mean have I felt the hit on my 160+ bitcoins or so? Not at all. Theyre still right where they belong. And until I cash them out for USD, I haven&#039;t lost a thing. BUT, when BTC hit $225ish or so I cashed out 10 or so to buy some shiny new things.<br /><br />Will have to go back to ignoring you if the begging messages start up again my friend. Good luck.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />keep eating those beans kiddo

But bear in mind as more and more attention comes on BTC now that its mainstream, it will (slowly) increase in price from the corrected range. Although much slower then last time. One thing is that the sharks will have their eye on gaming/pump&amp;dumping again. :-\
