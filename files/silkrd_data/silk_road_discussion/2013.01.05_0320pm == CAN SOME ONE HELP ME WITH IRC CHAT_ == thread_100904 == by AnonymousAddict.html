				Are you trying to access the Silk Road chat?<br /><br />Click the onion icon -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced, and uncheck &quot;Configure ControlPort automatically&quot;, then restart the browser bundle.

				Yeah, that&#039;s wrong.&nbsp; You want it to be 9150, not 9151.&nbsp; 9151 is the control port, not the Tor proxy port.&nbsp; Confusing, I know.<br /><br />It used to be 9050.&nbsp; It changed last update.<br />

				Er... not to contradict you and your wisdom, astor, but it did change to 9150.&nbsp; I swear it did in 2.3.25-4.&nbsp; Perhaps yours is still on 9050 because (like me) you set it that way through the standard torrc file?&nbsp; The browser bundle is now on 9150 in both Windows and Linux statically.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t vary anymore.<br /><br />It looks like you&#039;ve got the info right, anonymouse, but that you just don&#039;t have a circuit to the server yet.&nbsp; Try getting a new identity every few minutes and just don&#039;t hold your breath waiting.&nbsp; Should work.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t on in 15 minutes, I&#039;m wrong and it&#039;s probably something else that&#039;s the problem.<br /><br />P.S. - I hate mIRC.&nbsp; Not for particularly good reasons, but I still do.&nbsp; Try xchat.&nbsp; Or even pidgin.<br />

				It occurs to me -- you shouldn&#039;t need mIRC whitelisted.&nbsp; mIRC is only connecting to your local computer (that&#039;s what happens when you set things to go through Tor -- they connect to it on your local computer, and then Tor makes the actual connections to the internet).<br /><br />So it should *at least* be saying it was able to connect to 127.0.0.1:6667.&nbsp; Astor, are you sure that map thing doesn&#039;t actually alter the Windows hosts entries and cause mIRC to think it has the address and try to connect to it w/o a lookup or proxy...?<br /><br />Just a stab in the dark.<br />

				So it said Unable to resolve server before, and now it says Unable to connect to server (Connection timed out).<br /><br />The SocksPort in your torrc is 9150. Are you sure it is 9150 in mIRC?<br /><br />I screwed up earlier when I said 9050 because I forgot it&#039;s different in TBB than in the standalone Tor client.<br /><br />Make sure it is set to 9150. Another question, do you get that error immediately or does it take 10-30 seconds to see it?<br />

It&#039;s useful when programs don&#039;t know how to handle pseudo-TLDs and stuff. So the IRC client knows what an IP address is, it sends it to Tor&#039;s socks port, and Tor translates it to the onion domain and does what it normally does to connect to hidden services.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s why I asked how long it takes to see the error. If they&#039;re getting the error immediately, they probably configured the wrong SocksPort. If it takes 10-30 seconds, they probably just can&#039;t reach the server.<br />

				I see your point, but... well what&#039;s confusing me is exactly what&#039;s reporting to mIRC that this silcroadxxx.onion address is 192.x.x.x?<br /><br />It can&#039;t be Tor.&nbsp; Tor shouldn&#039;t have any more control than mIRC does over the system.&nbsp; Unless you&#039;re running it as admin in Windows?&nbsp; Does it require that?<br /><br />So mIRC makes a function call to the operating system to resolve the human-readable URL into the 123.456.789.012 numeric form.&nbsp; It shouldn&#039;t be trying to resolve that itself, it needs to call the OS because if two people try to do the same job they&#91;&#039;re going to do it slightly differently and then everything gets all fucked.&nbsp; So if it isn&#039;t Windows that&#039;s registering this address system-wide, and reporting that to mIRC when queried... which mIRC then uses to connect to 192.x.x.x... who is?<br /><br />If that&#039;s the way it works, then it&#039;ll break mIRC.&nbsp; It&#039;ll always try to connect to a phantom 192 address that doesn&#039;t exist instead of 127.0.0.1:9150 the way it should.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t see how that mapaddress does anything but tell Tor to tell Windows to tell mIRC to never connect to the right place?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing something obvious, just don&#039;t see what?&nbsp; And the whole &quot;timing out&quot; thing is what I&#039;d expect when you try to connect to a black hole at an address that no one&#039;s listening at...?

				Tor does the DNS resolving. Here&#039;s what I know about it (quoting from the Freenode web site):<br /><br /><br />=====<br />&nbsp;If your IRC client can handle socks5 with remote dns, you can just connect to the .onion address directly. Otherwise, use Tor&#039;s &quot;mapaddress&quot; feature to fake it. (We do not recommend that you use Privoxy with irssi. It&#039;s unnecessary. Just use the &#039;mapaddress&#039; approach and torify irssi to start it up.) Add a line to your torrc, as in this example:<br /><br />mapaddress 10.40.40.40 p4fsi4ockecnea7l.onion<br /><br />Be sure to HUP (reload) Tor if you change your torrc. After you&#039;ve made the change, just connect your torified IRC client to the IP you specified in your mapaddress statement for the freenode service. Tor will do the conversion for you internally and you&#039;ll connect to freenode. <br />=====<br /><br /><br />Note that this &quot;remote DNS resolving&quot; is a feature of Socks5.&nbsp; Apparently, if the IRC client is configured for Socks4 or Socks4a, it won&#039;t work. So that&#039;s one potential problem. If you are using the wrong Socks port (9150 in this case), that&#039;s another potential problem.<br /><br />If your program can do Socks5 but not the &quot;remote DNS resolving&quot; part, that&#039;s a third potential problem. The fact that it said error resolving server is why I thought this was the problem and mapaddress is the solution. Even if it isn&#039;t the problem, using mapaddress won&#039;t hurt.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m not sure what the problem is, but they should check all the configuration stuff I mentioned again.

				Now THAT is how you ask for help. Nicely detailed. :)<br /><br />So yeah with the 25 second delay I&#039;d say you just can&#039;t connect to the server.<br /><br />You can check to see if Tor is trying to connect to it. onion icon -&gt; Network Map<br /><br />Let your browser bundle sit idle for a few minutes so it isn&#039;t building circuits. Then try to connect in mIRC and you should see it building a lot of circuits (that fail). Then I&#039;d say it is confirmed that your Tor is having trouble connecting to the hidden service (and mIRC is configured correctly).

				Ahh, I got it.&nbsp; So yeah, I guess that would work -- mIRC sees the already-resolved address and calls for a socket to that address, which Windows fulfills and gives back to mIRC.&nbsp; What mIRC doesn&#039;t know though is that Tor has already mentioned to Windows that 192.0.2.2 is a synonym for 127.0.0.1, so Windows connected the socket mIRC asked for to 127.0.0.1:9150 and not 192.0.2.2/6667 like mIRC thought.<br /><br />Then Tor does it&#039;s usual thing, all while mIRC is unaware it isn&#039;t connecting directly to whatever wherever.&nbsp; Neat.&nbsp; Seems like the same thing as torify or socksify does, basically, but still neat that Tor has the feature written in natively.<br />

That means Tor isn&#039;t trying to reach the server. As Hash said, there could be some problem with mIRC. I was able to get mIRC to connect when I tested it in a Windows VM, but who knows.<br /><br />You could try with Pidgin. Pidgin works well with Tor. It even has a Tor mode. Use all the same configuration settings except use the onion address for server, not the IP address. Remove the mapaddress line in torrc. <br /><br />In the proxy settings, use Tor/Privacy (SOCKS5) instead of the SOCKS5 option.<br />
