				On youtube I have seen tuts on how to access the Silkroad and many people commenting on it that they should take the videos down because they would ruin it for everybody.This led me to write this thread.<br /><br />Basically it&#039;s pretty simple.Every governement by now knows about SR so if the cat is already out of the bag then there is nothing more to lose.<br /><br />There is only something to gain now.If even more people came to know about SR then the customer base would naturally increase which in turn would attract more vendors.<br />More vendors means more supply and more competition&nbsp; = better prices.<br /><br />Also,I think that if say SR trades were to tenfold then this would also give stability to the Bitcoin currency(this is only my theorie,but rember right now SR possibly accounts for 0,1 % of drug selling if at all so if one could push this up to 1 % I am pretty this would greatly influence bitcoin currency)<br /><br />Ok,so that&#039;s my wild thoughts on it,take it with a grain of salt and please correct me if you know better.<br /><br />Peace

				The governments are basically ignoring us BECAUSE we&#039;re relatively small time. If we become big then the government will have no choice but to burn through our tax money to try (and honestly, if they really wanted to they probably could do at least something) to take us down. I&#039;m not for quarantining our community because that would be unfair to those that can figure out tor, pgp, and btc but I&#039;m also highly against advertising.

				If it were guaranteed that Silk Road could not be compromised by LE, you would be right. But all it takes is one kid OD&#039;ing on H they bought from Silk Road and this being reported on national news. Politicians would be forced to conceive a success in the fight against SR. Do not make the mistake of thinking SR is invulnerable, our enemies have money and power and they will use it against SR.

				I think most utube viewers probably think it is a joke/scam.<br /><br />Buying drugs on the internet?&nbsp; Not possible<br /><br />I introduced my ex-wife to this site<br /><br />First Reaction:&nbsp; &nbsp; Buying drugs on the internet?&nbsp; Not possible (after telling on phone)<br /><br />Second Reaction : Looks too cheap, product must be cut, and you will get arrested&nbsp; &nbsp;(after seeing site)<br /><br />Third Reaction:&nbsp; Must be cut with something&nbsp; &nbsp;(after seeing bag of meth, 3x cheaper than local)<br /><br />Fourth Reaction:&nbsp; Good stuff, go straight to head, not like last local crap (after first puff)<br /><br />Fifth Reaction : Best stuff ever.&nbsp; BEST STUFF........

				Well,you may be right,I found SR because I was watching the Spuiten en Slikken Episodes on youtube.But I already knew beforehand that you could order (illegal) drugs online.A few years ago,I already ordered a few times weed from dutchgreenclub.Then I became a member on thepiponline2 forum where I learned about ravesupply@hushmail.com but I never got around to ordering before forum was shutdown.<br /><br />So when I saw the Vid on SR I knew exactly what it was about.<br /><br /><br />

				all you members that live in the woods need to move into the city. seriously everyone from outside the city is so paranoid about drugs. I&#039;m someone who started selling weed in sophmore year of high school, been doing it for 5-6 years since then, have been arrested for everything BUT possession of and substance, had cops come in my house for a warrant after I burn a cannon fucking blunt and tell me that it smells nice and me and my friends were making them jealous while they took me down to the station like GENTLEMEN to get that warrant sorted out. TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW; THERE AIN&#039;T SHIT THEY CAN DO. THEY ARE LOOSING EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR STUPID ASS WARS. Don&#039;t be stupid tho, peer-to-peer information sharing, don&#039;t put up ads. I don&#039;t even want most of the people from my city knowing about it, because it makes me the illest connect around since I can get EVERYTHING KNOWN TO MAN. yeeeeah buddy xD

				Here&#039;s one thing that I think may end this debate.<br /><br />They don&#039;t need money and power to take SR down. <br /><br />If enough attention gets out about SR to the public, the government may be forced to take action.<br /><br />What will be the easiest mode of action for them? They will pass some shifty bill that will allow government officials to dispense drugs. You might think it&#039;s not possible, but seriously, think of all the other shit the government has passed and or tried to pass. NDAA anyone?<br /><br />If enough attention is brought to the silk road it could very possibly get to the point where we have LE dispensing pounds of legitimate drugs, only to build up a huge reputation. This will give them access and leverage with every other bulk dealer on SR, in terms of discussing deals, and it will also give them access to bulk buyers.&nbsp; You guys probably think there are none... Believe me, there are people using the SR for doing massive deals ($20,000-$40,000). It could quite literally lead to a complete shattering of a good majority of SR&#039;s MAJOR vendors. <br /><br />If major vendors were to start disappearing, and were prevented from accessing a computer, we would have no way of knowing who exactly is the undercover LE with a massive reputation that he built up because of some stupid act that got passed that allowed him to dispense real drugs because silk road became way to involved in the public eye.<br /><br />SR reflects the real world drug trade. While the majority of the SR is bottom level drug users, buying grams... then there&#039;s another level of low level disturbers... then medium level distributes who give to the low level, then high level distributes who give to the medium level... then there&#039;s the Major Players, while there&#039;s not many of them, there are a few, these are the people moving 10-20, even up to 50-100 pounds/kgs of substance at a time.<br /><br />Most people are very lucky to run into a Major player in the real world, just like you would be very lucky to come to contact with one of them and have them reveal their identity on here. <br /><br />It&#039;s an entire hierarchy, a pyramid. Don&#039;t think that just because the majority of people on here are low level users, that political attention will just completely ignore the major players that are on here. If these major players get cut off, there&#039;s going to be a lot of circulation cut off down the chain. <br /><br />Yes telling people about SR would increase bitcoin stability, decrease prices, increase vendors, and increase options, but with all these benefits it will also bring a lot more negatives in with potential for politicians to add new acts that will change the rules of the playing field, which could ultimately kill the SR. SR isn&#039;t invincible, as much as we all would like it to be. When we live in worlds were governments can introduce acts that take our even our basic humans rights freedoms away(NDAA), they can pretty much do whatever the fuck they want. The best move is to minimize the amount of attention. <br /><br />Don&#039;t tell people. Let them find it on their own. If you&#039;re going out telling people you may end up telling people who would have never searched for drugs in the first place online, and that information may go from them to their cop buddy. Don&#039;t fool yourself, not every single cop or sherrifs office knows about the SR. Cops aren&#039;t likely to go put in a lot of effort to &quot;search for drugs online&quot;, especially to the lengths it takes getting on TOR and SR.<br /><br />The best move is to let people find it on their own when they are searching. I don&#039;t even tell my friends about it. Never tell someone something that you wouldn&#039;t mind having repeated to at least 5 different people whom you have no control over, you never know, someone on the other team may be pointing a gun at their head one day.

				Don&#039;t worry about this too much, if the LEA will start selling drugs to infiltrate, the combined brainpower of SR users and administration will find solution for this problem. Like they did in past when there was threat of someone selling poisoned drugs here.
