				Never had the pleasure of reading BH&#039;s posts but after enduring 2 weeks of mtljohns abusive ranting he has to get my vote, never has one dick head spawned so many shills sending him up which at lest made the SR down time somewhat more bearable.

				i never had any problems boss, he was actually one of the first vendors i ever used. I always enjoyed his BT and actually miss it and with he still had it. It was great quality for the price. He was def a character on the forums tho, and people claimed he scammed on MP to BTC transfers correct? He never did me wrong tho and i bought BTCs from him once with a moneypak, but he prolly knew most of it was going right back to him for tar.
