				I love what this thread has turned into. A DPR yacht party somewhere in international waters might be nice. After the tin foil hats come off at the end of the night we can all go our own separate ways at the end of the party As for meeting fellow SR users, I&#039;ve met one in public just through some sly communication and that user&#039;s secret is safe but I have met a user or two who constantly post and buy things since I suggested coming on here instead of walking down to the corner.

I have never told anyone on here that I met in real life my username though as if they ever wanted to snitch they could describe how I look with my username, no good.&nbsp; <br />There is a certain women vendor on here who I met and have become good friends with.
