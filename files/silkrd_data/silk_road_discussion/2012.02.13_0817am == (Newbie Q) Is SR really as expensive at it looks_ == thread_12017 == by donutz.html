				Yes I am a complete newbie to this site, but No I don&#039;t need any primers on buying BitCoins, it seems pretty straightforward to me. But when I calculate the costs of what vendors are asking for their products I have to wonder: Am I missing some secret here to buying BTC or is everybody paying the same&nbsp; inflated prices for their desired products as a result of their multi-dinger transactions in the quest to get their BTC? The exchange rate of purchasing BTC is bad enough but then there are the fees. That ฿27.73 gram of coke has an adjusted price tag of $160. Nobody in their right mind would pay this. That can&#039;t be right. Or can it? <br /><br />sorry for starting a new thread about this, i&#039;m sure it&#039;s been asked fifty times this year already. i appreciate it, thanks folks

				In the long term, I expect prices on SR to actually decrease to below the price of drugs on the high street.<br /><br />This is for the same reason Amazon/Ebay prices are generally cheaper than in a high street store for books or electronics.<br />i.e. the distribution mechanism, all those hundreds of thousands of drug dealers are going to eventually get put out of business by organizations like the Silk Road.<br /><br />However, that will take time. Volume and Competition aren&#039;t yet sufficient. Also, many solutions and technologies need to evolve before Silk Road becomes mainstream. Buying drugs should be possible using a credit card and regular web browser by complete newbs with complete anonymity. <br /><br />Anyway, don&#039;t be sad, like Redforever says, the quality is well above par. And for sellers/buyers, there are lots of arbitrage opportunities to participate in. <br /><br />One must consider that within the US alone, drugs can either cost 1/3 or 3x more of what you&#039;d pay in some parts of the states. There are serious serious arbitrage opportunities of the most basic nature available to us through SR. If SR isn&#039;t transacting millions of dollars a day by next anniversary, I&#039;ll be surprised.<br /><br />

				For about a 10% premium over street prices, I get a wide choice of high quality, on weight products which are delivered to my door and I get access to a community of mostly very nice people.<br /><br />Using your coke example. On SR, the best coke costs about £100 a gram but can quite reasonably be 70% pure and up. <br />Street coke in the UK costs around £40-60 a gram and is commonly 70% benzocaine + caffeine. The last street MDMA I bought 12 months ago was 20% sucrose. We used to get weed sprayed with glass beads. The most commonly available Euro hash has bits of polythene in. Bad pills are still fairly common.<br /><br />Also when I buy on Silk Road I don&#039;t have to either hang around in the pissing rain for a drug dealers &#039;5 minutes&#039; waiting for a taxi to drop it off, or go to some grotty bedsit and make small talk with some drug market bottom-feeder. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think SR is expensive at all!

				Weed and hash are both cheaper/same as street level where I live. So I am not complaining about not having to find shady dealers with shit product anymore.

				It seems like just coke, opiates, and pharmaceuticals&nbsp; that are way more expensive here. That makes a lot of sense too since it&#039;s the main three that are controlled by the cartels, US letter agencies like the CIA, and pharmaceutical giants. So when those products are offered at such a large market demand far outweighs supply, and vendors can&#039;t make more like with just about every other drug. They rely on the aforementioned suppliers who don&#039;t care if the product is sold here or on the street. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of money to be made if one of you buys a sail boat, takes it to Columbia, and teaches those cartel guys how to use SR and figure out a way to safely ship to the states, maybe through the Caribbean on your sail boat ;)

				I have to admit, the coke i bought on SR is the best i ever had. So if dealers on the street offer you their &#039;best&#039; @ 20%/gr and you can buy it here @80%/gr that makes the difference. Ok, the little pile of powder looks the same for allmost 3x the street price, but hey... you have to try it&nbsp; ;)<br />But i&#039;m not gonna buy it anymore, sos aint my favorite drug. I just wanted to know what the real stuff was like&nbsp; 8)

You have to remember how Ebay and Amazon source their products, there&#039;s different things you have to deal with when you source illegal products you can probably take a guess at a few, plus nobody wants to wait days for weed I think the general quality of street drugs will be a lot higher if Silk Road expands but it won&#039;t put street sellers out of business.<br /><br />We shouldn&#039;t have complete newbs buying drugs with complete anonymity especially if you see some of the questions or things that are said on this forum (or others) you might get a complete idiot OD-ing or seriously messing himself by having that much freedom/access to drugs.

				Yeah I see what you mean about quality, I don&#039;t deny that a lot of these are rather pure, but that&#039;s still hard for me to believe if they ever surpass or even approach the value parity with their street counterparts. Some things can&#039;t be compared though, such as the pharms. A pill is a pill and they can&#039;t get any cleaner, all of those prices are a joke. And I wonder if the ketamine would be cut with methoxetamine these days as well, considering how cheap and prevalent it is now. But that&#039;s another issue.<br /><br />Anyways so I guess there&#039;s no clandestine way to buy BTC on the Silk Road itself and save tons of cash by getting the best exchange rate? Or we just bite the bullet? Thanks for answering, I felt real dumb asking such a naive question but I just had to do some kind of double take against all this info<br /><br />
