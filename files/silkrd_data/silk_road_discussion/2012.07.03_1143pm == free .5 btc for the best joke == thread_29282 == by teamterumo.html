				I don&#039;t want your BTCs, but we should turn this into a joke thread.<br /><br />There&#039;s this guy walking through a large field on a nice sunny day. He&#039;s just enjoying nature and relaxing, he thought he was alone until he saw some man walking in the distance. He was feeling good, so he decides he wants to talk to him. The guy approaches this person, and he sees the person walking around in a circle, he sees that he&#039;s mumbling something. As he gets closer he sees that the guy is circling a hole, a pretty deep hole, and he is saying, &quot;110, 110, 110, 110, 110..&quot; The guy is curious so he says, &quot;What is 110? Why do you keep saying it&quot; The other guy pushes him into the hole and then says, &quot;111, 111, 111, 111, 111, 111.&quot;<br />

He hears some loud noises coming down the hall, so he gets into her closet because he is scared.<br /><br />the noises were his mom and some man getting into it hot and heavy, and when they finally get to the bed, they hear the husband return home. The strange man grabs his clothes and hides in the closet....there is a moment of silence, and the boy finally says, &quot;It&#039;s dark in here&quot; this scares the man half to death. trembling, he asks the boy not to tell his father what happened. the boy says &quot;sure, if you get me a bike&quot;. the man agrees to buy the boy a bike.<br /><br />The next day the boy is in the closet again, and the same thing happens. The man is startled once again when the boy says &quot;It&#039;s dark in here&quot; The man offers the boy $100 to keep his mouth shut about what happened, and the boy agrees. <br /><br />The following day, the boys father sees his son riding this brand new bike down the road, and when he got off of the bike, the $100 bill fell from his pocket.

				A female CNN journalist heard about a very old Jewish man who had been going to the Western Wall to pray, twice a day, every day, for a long, long time.<br /><br />So she went to check it out. She went to the Western Wall and there he was, walking slowly up to the holy site.<br /><br />She watched him pray and after about 45 minutes, when he turned to leave, using a cane and moving very slowly, she approached him for an interview.<br /><br />&quot;Pardon me, sir, I&#039;m Rebecca Smith from CNN. What&#039;s your name?<br /><br />&quot;Morris Feinberg,&quot; he replied.<br /><br />&quot;Sir, how long have you been coming to the Western Wall and praying?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;For about 60 years.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;60 years! That&#039;s amazing! What do you pray for?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I pray for peace between the Christians, Jews and the Muslims.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I pray for all the wars and all the hatred to stop.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I pray for all our children to grow up safely as responsible adults and to love their fellow man.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I pray that politicians tell us the truth and put the interests of the people ahead of their own interests.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;How do you feel after doing this for 60 years?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Like I&#039;m talking to a fucking wall.&quot;

				A duck walks into a bar, goes up to the bartender and asks &#039;Do you have any grapes?&#039;, to which the bartender replies &#039;No sorry, we don&#039;t sell grapes here, try the green-grocer down the road&#039;. The duck thanks the bartender and goes on his way.<br /><br />The next day the duck comes back in, walks up to the bartender, and again asks, &#039;Do you have any grapes?&#039;. The bartender, a little annoyed now, tells the duck &#039;No mate, I told you yesterday, we&#039;re a bar. We don&#039;t sell grapes here, now quit asking and buzz off.&#039; The duck, unperturbed, strolls casually out of the bar.<br /><br />The following day the duck is back once again. He walks right up to the bartender (who is already fuming at the sight of this fucking duck) and says &#039;Hey buddy, do you have any grapes?&#039; At this, the bartender loses his shit. Screaming now, he replies &#039;Look, you fucking duck. I&#039;ve been telling you for the past two days, we&#039;re a bar. We don&#039;t sell grapes, we never have and we never will. If you come into this bar again asking for grapes, I&#039;m going to nail your fucking bill to the counter.&#039;. &#039;Oh, well, OK then!&#039; says the duck, &#039;You don&#039;t have to be so rude about it.&#039;. Obviously, the bartender is glad to see the back of him.<br /><br />He isn&#039;t so happy then, you can imagine, when the duck struts right up to the bar the very next day. &#039;Now what in fuck&#039;s name do you want?&#039; he asks the duck, to which the duck says &#039;I&#039;ve just come to see if you have any nails&#039;. Perplexed and a little suspicious, the bartender replies &#039;What? No, of course we don&#039;t have any nails. I think by now your well aware that this is a bar!&#039;. And at that, the duck asks the bartender, &#039;Do you have any grapes?&#039;
