				Is this Silk Road thing just a total scam??? I am a fairly new member of Silk Road, i have placed 12 orders over 2 months.&nbsp; &nbsp;So far only 5 have arrived.&nbsp; &nbsp;One order cancelled because i was new.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some Well-known, reputable Vendors tell me DON&#039;T RESOLVE or they will not any accept future orders from me.......so i let a few orders Auto-Finalize because they had not arrived yet.....the orders DID arrive, but .now my Auto-Finalize rate is high and 2 different Vendors are refusing to take my new orders because my Auto-Finalize rate is too high!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; WHAT THE HELL ??????&nbsp; &nbsp; How is this supposed to work?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Silk Road Support sends me 2 line replies and does nothing.....

				If you are not a troll, then you unfortunately got off to a rough start. Best thing to do is start afresh with a clean slate by opening a new account. You&#039;ll lose all your successful feedback and would have to start from square one, but you probably have a better chance with vendors as a newbie than as a long time user with bad rep.

				u must have had some bad luck. sorry to hear that bud. my recommendation would be to NEVER let an order auto finalize. always go thru the resolution centre and ask for an extension for however long u think u need. if u ask for 5 days and come the 4th day nothing has arrived u can request another extension. Thats why SR rules bud. Take care. MBMC

				yea the auto finalize deal really sucks for us vendors as bitcoin prices fluctuate wildly sometimes - I personally state on my profile page<br />auto finalizers are banned from future purchases.<br /><br />Start a new account
