				So today I logged into my account to see that my balance had been dropped from ~200 BTC to zero. I thought I may have been hacked but went into my account page and saw three withdrawals, so I figured auto-withdraw was acting up again. Disabled it over two weeks ago and apparently now it&#039;s decided to re-enable itself, so I figured all was okay.<br /><br />I opened up my bitcoin client to see that only one of the transactions was received. Luckily it was by far the biggest one, but I have no idea what happened to the other two. ~60 BTC has gone missing. I checked my two other auto-withdraw addresses on blockchain.info and they are showing no transactions received on either of the other two.<br /><br />This feature is really annoying me at this point because this isn&#039;t the first time it&#039;s re-enabled itself. At least last time they bitcoins made it into my wallet...<br /><br />Anyone know what happened or what I can do about it?
