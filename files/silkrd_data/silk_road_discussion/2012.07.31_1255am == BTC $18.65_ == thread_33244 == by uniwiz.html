				I happen to just send a bunch of BTC to my SR account to make some purchases. Upon refreshing the page I noticed my balanced was updated and I went and placed a few orders... all hedged.<br /><br />Then I looked at my account history, the BTC I sent havent even arrived yet.<br /><br />This is going to make me lose so much money if each of these vendors cancel my orders. A vendor canceled my (hedged) order earlier and I lost $100 as a result..... If my recent orders get canceled... then im down the drain $400 possibly

				I would urge all users to hold off on transactions until we figure out what&#039;s going out with btc-e. I would also urge those of you with coins at btc-e to withdraw them IMMEDIATELY, and not to make any transactions there. GreenGiant, were you able to withdraw your USD??<br /><br />This is clearly a btc-e hack. Secure your coins right now, if at all possible.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

Any BTC you put into btc-e is going into the hotwallet - the hotwallet was cleaned out by the hacker, but he/she can still withdraw any BTC put into it whilst they have control. They&#039;re using fake USD to buy up coins (by adjusting their USD balance), so you&#039;ll lose your coins and you&#039;ll receive imaginary USD.

				I wouldn&#039;t try to deposit anything to BTC-E. You will lose it. The only person who is going to make out is the guy who purchases BTC with a fake 1 mil note. Once he gets his BTC out of BTC-E and into another exchange they will be able to sell them off at around 9 a BTC still pulling in some big change. All the specs at BTC-E are about to get burned.

All they would have to do is move the market value up to 40 bucks say they got hacked clog up their own system with the news and take the coin. That is the one problem with bitcoin. No one governs it, the people running these trading sites have no one to answer to. They can do whatever they want.

				The weird thing is at first glance, it looks legit, but i the bitcoin people are saying that it has to be a btc-e hack... why cant sites get really good security??? Something is wrong...<br /><br />BTC-E got hacked or it was an inside job and did another bitcoinica or whatever.. It all comes down to your own security... Dont put your coin where you CANT control it... Im guessing that there will be some official &quot;Bitcoin&quot; governing body soon, these scams just dont stop.. it will destroy the bitcoin before it gets going... Something has to be done about these scams..

				I Just checked the block chain and a shit ton of coins just went thru with 9 confirmations.... I would secure all your bitcoins and if you have a btc-e account try to get them out.. This is going to have very bad ramifications to the bitcoin and a lot of people on bitc-e hopefully didnt lose a lot.. it all depends if they had coins in cold storage or not.. Im not that technical, but this isnt good at all...<br /><br />Number?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hash?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Time?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Transactions?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total BTC?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Size(kB)?<br />191629 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39d62c3f04... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 04:25:23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;473 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8029.96161796 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;245.806<br />191628 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65934f20b0... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 04:15:16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;584 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10935.44125462 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;248.998<br />191627 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5101058ce1... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 04:07:53 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;321 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13027.14111598 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.729<br />191626 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197827fcce... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 04:00:18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;707 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9648.2683871 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;249.085<br />191625 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8484956a95... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 03:54:52 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;522 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10216.30866425 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;251.212<br />191624 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5e0949ebae... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 03:38:17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;676.48270597 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.817<br />191623 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5241049efc... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 03:27:11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;630 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23463.67137221 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;419.942<br />191622 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76b892483f... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 03:00:31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94018.78380609 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;345.854<br />191621 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7dd45a87e7... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 02:36:47 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;528 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28967.48148827 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;251.77<br />191620 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;733fbae98f... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 01:38:07 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;298 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3743.46173064 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.679<br />191619 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7407be1164... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 01:36:47 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30129.97570177 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.544<br />191618 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2c5ca7b4bf... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 01:16:04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64516.54980258 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;284.004<br />191617 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5b6d3bc139... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 01:10:45 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19242.06689571 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.984<br />191616 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7b09737978... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 01:03:21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1155.0122651 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.046<br />191615 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15690aea5d... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 01:01:28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;400 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5527.99876897 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;209.244<br />191614 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;567e6ec329... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 00:56:38 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8321.53871726 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40.52<br />191613 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51cbf5b775... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 00:53:05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1054.23557038 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.516<br />191612 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10b772c976... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 00:45:05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2770.73263067 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49.063<br />191611 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6e26cf32db... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 00:40:18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7141.40429737 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49.01<br />191610 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2413d1e162... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-07-31 00:25:28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5277.4114265 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48.721<br /><br /><br />But 23k coins in one block? 10k? in&nbsp; another? the above is hard to read, but if you go to blockexplorer, its a let easer to see.. <br />

				I can&#039;t find my transaction in the blockchain and I have a feeling anyone dumb enough to send their coins to BTC-e got ripped off for trying to be greedy and buy coins at $9 at Mt.

Apparently the &quot;hacker&quot; used fake Liberty Reserve USD to buy Bitcoin, so it looks as though it was only 2,000 BTC stolen.<br /><br />This post from &quot;BkkCoins&quot; over at bitcointalk.org (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=96802.280) explains what is now likely to happen:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">They can reverse all the trades and restore balance to pre-hack time. But they will not be able to give back BTC that have been withdrawn. So either they make good and buy it in the market, or they say tough luck and customers lose. I expect they&#039;ll reverse everything and then see how much BTC they would need to buy. And at that point they&#039;ll decide who loses.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So my earlier estimate of 10,000 BTC and QuikMart&#039;s estimate of 187,000 BTC were both well off the mark.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Hey guys thanks for all the informative posts. I have a question that I didn&#039;t find the answer to.I made a buy today when the exchange rate was normal, do you think my order will get canceled?&nbsp; What do you guys think will happen with purchases made before this problem?

				Looks like we all back to normal.<br /><br />Good news BTC-e recovered.<br />That would mean no &quot;cash out&quot; crash?<br /><br />SR Admin might want to learn from this lesson, and throw out bogus BTC values in the rolling average ;)<br /><br />I see BTC on the rise again today.

If you can sell your bitcoins on btc-e for $30 and buy them on mtgox for $9... this looks like an opportunity.
