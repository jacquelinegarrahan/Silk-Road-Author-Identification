			<dd class="postbody">
				I was wondering if anybody knows of any research that has been done about Silk Road?<br /><br />Context: I&#039;m currently doing my economics PhD, and part of my thesis will be looking at emergent market institutions... which basically means I&#039;ll be looking at why people respect private property and contracts, even when there is nobody to enforce the rules. Obviously, this is very relevant for SR since there is no government here, and yet the market exists and seems to be growing.<br /><br />So my plan is to hang around the SR world looking for useable data on how effective this non-government market system is working. At some point I hope to conduct a survey of buyers and sellers asking about your experiences. If I&#039;m lucky, I might also get funding to run some experiments on SR, where I&#039;ll pay you to play some (fully legal) games.<br /><br />If anybody knows of any other similar research that has been done about Silk Road, I would love to hear about it. You can message me here, or e-mail me directly on john.humphreys99@gmail.com. Suffice to say, all individual correspondence will be kept in strict confidence (which is a requirement of my research)... and you&#039;re still anonymous so you&#039;re safe anyway.<br /><br />btw, this is my real name... I am not anonymous on SR. I have done this so that you can be more confident that I&#039;m dealing honestly. Obviously then I don&#039;t plan on buying or selling any drugs (or anything else). You can find out about me at my website: www.johnhumphreys.com.au <br /><br />(Sorry for double-posting this. I&#039;m still learning my way around here, and I wasn&#039;t sure which forum was the most appropriate. Mea culpa.)

				Thanks John.<br /><br />You will find some will not like what you are doing, and then there are those of us who appreciate it.<br /><br />Make SR a household name. <br /><br />Tell the world so more mums and dads start taking notice that the money spent trying to eradicate drugs is not working, because the enforcers are standing around holding their dicks and scratching their heads while places like SR flourish..<br /><br />Are you sure we cannot interest you in some little vice? ...for research of course ;)

				you picked a VERY interesting time to cruise around the Silk Road - this weekend is like a candyland for us&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />&nbsp;and I would actually be very interested in this research thesis paper of yours. and in regards to research in specific, I have not heard of any directly related to SR, but I have read numerous studies of how black markets and underground businesses actually help keep many countries&#039; economic markets alive and well, especially after the crash in &#039;08 - all done through cash deals with no help from courts, lawyers, or governments (United States included, and I think Greece or Italy had the highest % with annual grossed money through black markets). nonetheless, you can most likely do a search for those specific stats around the world. very interesting. especially because it fucking works&nbsp;

				Thanks all... I appreciate the feedback. Once I have anything definitive to report, I&#039;ll be sure to share it with the SR community. Note that my interest is not related to what you are buying/selling, but rather with the degree of honesty that occurs in an anonymous market. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10991.msg100564#msg100564">Quote from: randomovdbuser on February 03, 2012, 09:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">sure, that&#039;s what we absolutely need, academic papers covering SR<br />I hope you know what you&#039;re getting (us) into...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m fairly sure that the authorities already know that SR exists. I don&#039;t think a few academic economists are going to be the thing that brings down the system. :)<br /><br />If there is anybody out there who knows some of the history of SR and would be willing to talk me through some of the scams that have occurred, that would be a big help too. I&#039;ve seen some discussion of scammers already, but would be interested to know how much of a reputation the scammers had built up before they cheated the system. For example, I wonder if any of the scammers were regulars on this forum, with &gt;100 comments and &quot;full member&quot; status?<br /><br />Probably best to send me a PM if you are interested &amp; able to help. Somebody has suggested I get PGP, and once I work out what that means, then I&#039;ll do that too. Cheers.

				PGP is an encryption protocol (stands for Pretty Good Privacy). There&#039;s a sticky in the Security forum about it.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to help you, but I&#039;m fairly new here myself. Don&#039;t let my (or anyone else&#039;s) post count fool you. A vendor&#039;s transaction history is taken much more seriously into account than their post history when gauging their trustworthiness. Dilligent users will look at both, and also try to get in contact with previous customers of that person in the Rumor Mill subforum.

				For PGP, this link has a good tutorial:<br />http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/guides/shepj.html<br /><br />You should definitely look up the SumYunGai controversy. He was a top rated Bitcoin exchanger who disappeared after someone sent him a large amount to convert. Nearly all the reviews were positive before that and he was a nice guy to deal with. It&#039;s hard to guard against that but you can mitigate risk by spreading out large transactions when possible. People like that seem to be in the minority though and most people here seem to be good, honest people (at least here on SR anyway). <br />

				You should also look into the GummyStars scam.<br /><br />He was a very friendly vendor with absolutely no rep whatsoever. Good communication yet deceitful about orders. Offered free samples to people, buy some and get some extra free to finalize early. He requested it to help keep stocks moving and good communication is not trademark of scammers so he convinced some people to risk it. I was one of the first but then things started not showing up yet people continued to give their money away for days. Even after it was out something was up he continued on all sorts of excuses trying to either get more money or worse try to harvest more addresses for purposes I try not to consider. <br /><br />In another case, I received an order successfully with an awesome deal, and vouched for Ender on the forum. I was even discussing arranging another order and then he went silent. Some people had finalized early and lost money then claimed scammer. I really dont know what to think but hope something worse didnt happen to him. I feel this made me look bad in a way, giving a good review for someone who caused people to lose money, and your reputation is a very important thing around here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these really taught me a harsh lesson about wanting to trust people and help them out while having to worry about them being deceitful in an anonymous world. <br /><br />Good luck with your work, it seems like a very interesting concept.<br />- miR

When the white market crashes and burns due to malign influence or unintended consequences when governments throw spanners into the works, then it is up to the purest market of them all to provide that necessary dynamism to keep the Market alive. Even the DPRK has the black market.<br /><br />It&#039;s just survival of the fittest and I think there is nothing more ferociously beautiful. If the black market were itself a drug like alcohol it would be like having your brain hit with a slice of lemon wrapped around a gold brick.<br /><br />Protip John Humphreys, I&#039;ve already done an informal survey on the success of the Silk Road. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11731.30;topicseen<br /><br />We currently have an almost 97% DSR (delivery success rate) across the board. Yeah, people respect private property and contracts, they know what&#039;s good for them. I guess you&#039;ll be studying our system using some model like Prisoner&#039;s Dilemma, so I suggest looking at Robert Axelrod&#039;s work on the subject and the Tit for Tit algorithm.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat<br /><br />Prisoner&#039;s Dilemma in general is a fascinating subject and I&#039;d encourage any professional vendor to look into the research.

				i&#039;m not the one crying about having to pay for a service. You have plenty of valid points but when you start saying &#039;OMG I NEED TO PAY FOR THIS&#039; it makes you just sound like a whiner. Plus it irritates me to see you use the word tax in the way you are, SR isn&#039;t forcing you to use SR.

BARRATT<br />Article first published online: 8 FEB 2012<br />DOI: 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03709.x<br />Addiction © 2012 Society for the Study of Addiction<br />Addiction<br />Volume 107, Issue 3, page 683, March 2012<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Keywords:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug markets;illicit drugs;internet<br />Internet and digital technologies have been discussed recently by Addiction contributors in relation to the delivery of efficient computer-delivered brief interventions [1,2], online methodologies for recruiting and surveying illicit drug users [3] and the internet&#039;s role in facilitating the spread of information and sale of emerging drugs such as mephedrone [4] and synthetic cannabinoids [5].<br />Here, I introduce readers to a novel use of the internet in the drugs field. The anonymous online drug market-place Silk Road was first revealed in June 2011 [6]. Silk Road is accessible only to people who are using Tor anonymizing software [7]. Tor uses encryption to make it impossible for anyone to trace IP addresses (the electronic code assigned to each computer on the internet). The front page of Silk Road looks a great deal like the front page of eBay. Goods and services for sale are categorized and all manner of drugs are available under the following categories: ecstasy, cannabis, dissociatives, psychedelics, opioids, stimulants, benzodiazepines and other. Sellers receive ratings from buyers and comments about the quality of their products, how fast they ship and the level of professionalism and discretion of the transaction. Trust in sellers is built on reputation. Silk Road traders use the anonymous currency Bitcoin [8]. This decentralized international currency operates through peer-to-peer technologies.<br />At the time of writing (October 2011), Silk Road is still online and continuing to expand. Facilitated by a combination of the internet and encryption technologies, buying and selling illegal products is now possible and may increase dramatically in the future. What may stop an exponential increase in the use of anonymous online drug market-places is the hurdle of delivery. At the end of the transaction, the physical product still needs to be sent to the buyer. Sending products between countries allows law enforcement the opportunity to intercept packages and potentially attempt to arrest the would-be importer. Sending products within the same country may make arrest less likely. There are also numerous barriers to entry for people who might want to use Silk Road. Installing and using Tor, buying and using Bitcoins in a secure way and taking the risk of fraud or arrest upon delivery may deter the majority of would-be users. Nevertheless, for the minority who master these concerns and are willing to take the risk, Silk Road has revolutionized how the internet can be used to source drugs. After all, buying drugs in the real world also involves considerable risk. For some, the online equivalent may prove more convenient and secure than arranging a standard deal.<br />There are many unanswered questions about Silk Road. The extent to which law enforcement can stop and disband a site such as this is yet to be seen. The extent to which drug users will use this new technology is also unknown. Needless to say, if anonymous online drug markets do end up expanding into mainstream drug markets, they will pose a real challenge to existing drug laws and policies. We should definitely watch this space.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />IRBs have evolved around online communities and research, so I&#039;m going to be waiting with bright eyes to see how &quot;watching this space&quot; goes. <br />Y&#039;all who search on here and find this, post on what your IRB says about monitoring and/or participating... &#039;cause although I consider the average SR user to be about as &#039;vulnerable&#039; as a laser-shark, the IRB here would say, &quot;No, you can&#039;t lurk and spy on a drug abusing population, they&#039;re vulnerable, and you might break their fragile little minds.&quot; (They routinely shoot down people who want to lurk on drug-related fora on the clearweb. Maybe our IRBs around here are just snottier or something.) The risk/anonymous nature brought up by ggg is a good point too.<br />For once I think I won&#039;t argue that people can be functional and still use drugs, I&#039;ll just support the review boards in their model of things.
