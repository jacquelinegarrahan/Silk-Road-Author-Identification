				I have lurked the forums here for quite a while now, and in the past month I decided to take the next step and get active.<br /><br />So far, I have had mostly great experiences on the Road. I have purchased from several vendors, have been happy with all of my product, and nearly always happy with the process (stealth, listing style, etc).<br /><br />--Yes, this topic AGAIN coming next--<br /><br />I purchase small amounts of various things for my own personal use, and like things that can be easily hidden away and used covertly. I am not a teenager living at home with my parents, but I still need to be stealthy.<br />Blah blah blah etc...<br />After a bunch of reading and deliberation, I decided to try an O Pen vape since it is stupid simple, easy to stash and so forth. I did some searching, and only found a couple vendors on the Road selling the thing and the carts for it. One vendor had it a lot cheaper than the other, so after a couple questions were quickly answered, I placed my order.<br />Here is the THAT part part of the ramble :<br />One vendor may have required FE depending on stats and such (I may have qualified, maybe not), the other vendor definitely required FE for that item in particular. So there I was (rock, hard place, don&#039;t buy). What do I do? Which choice is best? I made the choice to go for the cheaper one that did require FE from the outset. I figured that I really wanted to try this, and if I am to get scammed, it would be less painful if it were less money. I mean, I fully hope that I didn&#039;t make a mistake since for me, a hundred-ish bucks isn&#039;t something to just toss away. <br />The forums here are great and terrible at the same time. Reading feedback threads are very interesting as things can seem great, but then turn to shit near the end. When I decided to go on the purchase, the vendor I chose had great feedback in their forum thread. The last time I checked the thread, my vendor was being called a scammer, etc. No fun reading that when you just sent out some money that you would never have a chance to get back. <br />Well, never FE is something that is drilled into you in the first few minutes of browsing the forums. You can&#039;t not see someone saying to never FE. You can also rarely go a day without a thread or two of such and such scammer this, such and such person got scammed when they FE&#039;d etc. Each of those last threads will have your cast of characters calling the OP an idiot (deservedly) FE on their purchase. I hope to not be the next one to be called an idiot for being scammed, but if I am, I am coming back to post about it and will never (probably) FE again.<br /><br />If you want to get a head start, feel free to insult me now before anyone knows the outcome of my order. :D

				Def suks bro if in fact they decide to scam you. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had vendors send me my goods many many times FE&#039;ing. But that was after serious and careful inspection of them and deep thought. I&#039;ve had an item take a month before it got out to me, and that vendor went on to scam a shit ton of people two months later. Started seeing a trend of fucks that would get big and then go all fe and go out with a bang. Probably a select few who recycle their methods really.<br /><br />But, I&#039;ve also been scammed (for FE&#039;ing) for over 1k easy. Really shitty. But that has me not FE&#039;ing anymore. <br /><br />So..... it is what it is. Best to you. Good luck! <br />FYI some of the larger vendors on here do fe and ALWAYS come through. The few who do call them scammers, are likely , scammers... <br /><br /><br />

				I FE&#039;d on a couple of early orders (not that I have that many). It was for small amounts, and for vendors with a good rep, but I wouldn&#039;t do it again. Hope it works out for you.

				It&#039;s a tough call, you&#039;re entering into a contract with the vendor i suppose, and if they say FE, you can either argue or go to a different vendor. <br />Recently got an FE, my first since my first order. Little bit of a gamble. <br />I have a weird habit of ordering just as dealers are running out, and their listings go down a few days later - this def seems the time where they scam more often.<br />Anyway it&#039;s all a game, a gamble. Chances are it&#039;ll come through, or else you can come on the forums and try and vent your lost money through slamming the vendor...

				I have FE on every purchase..and every purchase has been wayyyyy heavy and with samples. It helps to read, read...READ! Also contact the vendor...you can get a good sense of a person just from the words they use when they reply.

				Never fe. Find a vendor that sells concentrates and doesn&#039;t require fe. Many out there. Omicron, persei, gpen, micro g, atmos raw, atmos junior are all great pens and likely a better option than the o pen. I haven&#039;t tried the open but not really interested either with all of the aforementioned options for pens.&nbsp;

				Just buy a chinese &quot;dry herb/concenctrate pen&quot; on the clearnet for cheaper and put some hash in it. Same thing without the vegetable glycerin or propolyne glycol. I haven&#039;t seen any studies but I don&#039;t think inhaling that shit can be good for you.

				Yeah, I know that there are a ton of options as far as a vape pen goes, but even with all of the limitations the o.pen looks right for me. No muss no fuss. Put on a cart, use it til its gone, put on a new one. Easy peasy and only one thing to have to hide away.<br /><br />I may eventually spread out to a more traditional pen, but we shall see.

				My vendor for MDMA is called a selective scammer on the daily and gives no fucks, quite frankly neither do I because I keep receiving his product and I don&#039;t have to FE. :D
