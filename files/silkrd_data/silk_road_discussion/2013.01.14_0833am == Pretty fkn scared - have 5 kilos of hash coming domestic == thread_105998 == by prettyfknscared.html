				Well I only see 2 ways of dealing with this.&nbsp; You can either walk in the post office and get it, or you can walk in the post office and get it.<br />You&#039;re not gonna send your friend in to take the heat if you think there is some.&nbsp; So at some point you have to actually do it.&nbsp; Just keep your eyes open.&nbsp; Situational awareness and all that.&nbsp; Due diligence.&nbsp; No one else will do it for you.

				If it&#039;s domestic then not so bad I suppose. But then I don&#039;t know which country you are in.<br />Lots of things that might weigh 5 kilos are sent domestic every day (maybe not to PO box&#039;s though). Why would they suspect your package of having drugs in it?<br /><br />Also depends on how you use the PO Box as well. There might already be a flag placed on your po box if you have aroused suspicion and not been using it like any other business/personal user would.<br /><br />Only problem now is this thread. <br />If LE were monitoring these forums closely, they now know that there is a 5 kg +packing parcel lying in some post office po box building.<br />Don&#039;t know how the po box system works eg if they are all owned by the same company. They could send a memo around by email to all po box post office managers asking to keep a look out for a ~5.3kilo parcel that is awaiting collection right now.<br /><br />Be careful dude and don&#039;t let them get to you. <br />Go in prepared and ready to run if shit hits the fan. <br />Wear velcro-on clothes so that if they grab on you can break free.&nbsp; <br />Have a getaway car waiting outside with its engine running. <br />Be ready to kill if necessary. Remember it&#039;s you or them and they need little excuse to exercise their license to kill.<br />Good luck bro.&nbsp; <br />If you win don&#039;t push your luck. Quit while ahead and retire in Spain.

				Hey folks forum Newbie here! A good day/eve/morn to y&#039;all where ever you may be.<br /><br />I have a little experience in this area if it helps... but of course that depends where you have the po box. You can call ahead and play dumb about receiving a package give a time and day when you&#039;ll be down to collect but leave it for another 24hrs and then collect. See how they sound on the phone and do a recce of the area before you do collect. Ask a mate to plot up near by from a place they can see you. You walk past the building and get him to text you the decrips of anyone following. Do a loop and then duck into the building to collect. If they are taking too long just leave it. But if you collect it have your buddy watch vehicles and folks near by. Its all about the prep! When you have to sign for it, act concerned that you didnt order it and ask if it&#039;s definitely the right package. If its a sting it will all be recorded and will work in your favour!

				I can&#039;t be arsed reading the other replies so if this has been stated in previous replies,. don&#039;t care.<br /><br />Go pick it up. If it was suspicious it would have been picked up and taken away by now, and you would have been notified that a package has been deemed suspicious<br /><br />However if your PO box is anonymous (AFAIK all PO Box registrations need a valid address etc.) then in that case they might be waiting to bust you on the pick uip, but it is extremely unlikely<br /><br />-Tunbear

				The thing that gets me is if I wasn&#039;t getting drugs mailed to me, and I had a controlled delivery to my house for a package for me, I would normally sign for it out of curiosity of what I was receiving - in todays world would people really not sign for a package in their name and want to see what it is?

Are we here to bash people spreading useful information or agree with the inbred moron fucks of this forum like the lorax.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Noooo definitely not here to bash people. Maybe sounded like I little dick but for the most part I wasn&#039;t trying to be. I&#039;m just saying you sounded like you were regretting your order. I was stating the fact that you had the choice to click the order button. If you&#039;re not regretting the order, well then I took it the wrong way. <br />Want to hear advice? Well I sure as hell never ordered that much. But I can tell you I feel like the more you worry the more troubles it can cause sometimes. This shits on its way whether you like it or not. It&#039;s gonna be in your box either way. DON&#039;T drive around the lot to check for LE. DON&#039;T take 5 minutes and check the area. I would say DON&#039;T even go 2am when nobody else is there. Do everything the way you normally would as if you were checking your mail on a day to day basis.<br />You are getting a package. You aren&#039;t doing anything wrong. So don&#039;t make it look like you are. That way if you get popped. I was just checking my damn mail! NOT: you drove around the lot for 5 minutes, constantly looked behind you to check for LE while walking into the PO, and went at 2AM.<br />Also like I said, I recommend recording everything. That way if something does go wrong YOU know what you said and how things went down. Great proof if you do the right things. It takes me 5-10 seconds to start recording then about another 5-10 seconds to delete the recording after everything is safe. I use this for a lot of things. If you ever get pulled over, never hurts either!<br />I sure as hell ain&#039;t here to bash on anyone. But I&#039;m saying, really you cant do anything about it now. Why waste the time thinking?<br />Theres no such thing as a &quot;safe pickup&quot;, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for. It&#039;s: you pick it up, or you don&#039;t pick it up. You get caught, or you don&#039;t get caught. I&#039;m not trying to be a dick there. I would be pretty fucking scared too if I had 5 fuckin kilos coming. But yet again I don&#039;t see why I would do that.<br />Also thankfully it&#039;s domestic! If it were overseas, I feel this would be a wayyy different story. As long as you trust the vendors packaging, you should feel fairly secure. I&#039;m hoping you made many purchases from this vendor before and you feel 100% safe with them. If you haven&#039;t ordered from them before, I&#039;d be a little more worried no knowing what the packaging is.<br />Overall good luck though. I don&#039;t know what else I could say.

				Pick up your package.&nbsp; The odds are in your favor that nothing will go down.&nbsp; &nbsp;But if you leave it then someone will most likely open it out of curiosity (it sure won&#039;t be returned to sender) And from that point on someone will be looking for someone.&nbsp; &nbsp; If I were you, I would get a xanax or 3 down, walk in there with out a care in the world,&nbsp; go home and laugh at yourself for being so sketched out.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But next time,&nbsp; do not order enough to choke a elephant.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you do it again,&nbsp; smaller orders and few and far between.&nbsp; &nbsp;GL and be sure to post the update.

				The safest thing to do, if you think there is any change that there will be cops waiting for you, is to take a gun. Once they see it they&#039;ll think &quot;we best not fuck with this guy&quot; and leave you alone.<br /><br />If anyone else makes eye contact, make sure you get the first shot off. Let them know who the boss is.<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				Hands down the most entertaining thread of 2013 thus far !!!<br /><br />It&#039;s a lot like &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. - I&#039;m still staying tuned to see what the fuck happens, yet at the same time, I can&#039;t even decide whether this is fact or fiction. <br /><br />If it&#039;s fact. It&#039;s a young guy.

What a great night to be on speed! LMFAO ROTFL !!!!<br /><br />5 Kilos !!! - I had to go to a conversion table, as the metric system never caught on here. It&#039;s just over 11 lbs. - So I imagine 2 5lb bags of sugar, and how that might be packaged. <br /><br />It boggles the mind. Maybe this is some college project to see what type of advice is given out on forums. <br /><br />Either way. It really made my night. I will be referring many friends to this who are either tweaking out, or just have insomnia. <br /><br />Peace 8)<br /><br />jagfug
