				certain vendors are being creative in their verbose listings and breaking search on the SR site.<br />it causes a massive amount of noise downing out any useful signal&nbsp; and makes searching for common products a little more tedious and a little less fun/.<br />i would go far as to say it is dos/spam on this level in this instance.<br /><br />while this vendor has no conflict with my tiny listings - i would imagine the same criticism could&nbsp; be levelled at me or other more blase vendors.<br /><br />so would it be possible to block certain vendors/filter listigs as to not add more noise to this process?

				no unfortunately there is no way to block a vendor from the results, I wish there was though.&nbsp; Like you said, there are vendors with several pages of listings that manage to find their way into search results unrelated to the query I input.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes too, it&#039;s a vendor that may have the product I&#039;m looking for, but I have no intention of purchasing from said vendor at any point, for whatever the reason.<br /><br />Maybe a way of filtering results is something DPR could think about for the future.

				thanks for your reply. <br />i&#039;m sure it isn&#039;t trivial to achieve or might tax server resources on the DB backend but the fact remains the search on SR isnt broken - but unless listings are moderated for this keyword stuffing i need a &quot;block this vendor&quot;<br /><br />maybe the vendor has scammed or has canceled my orders for having no transaction history or will only acceot FE - whatever the reason, i needa some spammy listigs out of the bulk of 4+ of search results.<br /><br />in any case<br />&quot;do not hesitate to ask for free samples of Keyword1, popular keywordX,&nbsp; Search-term Y to be included for FREE with this order&quot;<br /><br />should be changed to &quot;please check my other listings for other items you might wish to request as samples with your order&quot;<br /><br />the other thing this achieves to unsavvy new users&nbsp; is implant the impression&nbsp; the vendor is the&nbsp; walmart of SR by dominating the listings so heavily. [more like amazon dropshipping though]<br /><br />all to does to me is say &quot;never order off this cunt.&quot;
