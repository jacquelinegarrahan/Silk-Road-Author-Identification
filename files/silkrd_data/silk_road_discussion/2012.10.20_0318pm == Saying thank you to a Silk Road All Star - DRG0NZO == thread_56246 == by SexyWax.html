				I just want to use this thread to point out a super star here on Silk Road and say thank you. Drg0nzo (the SR vendor) is one of the best people I have ever met, not only on SR but anywhere. I obviously won&#039;t go into specifics, but everyone I talk to can&#039;t say enough good things about him, he has taken many folk under his wing and made miracles happen for some of us. If anyone else would like to say thank you and show your appreciation to the doctor please do so here.<br /><br />Here&#039;s to you DRG0NZO, you truly are an amazing human being. <br /><br />-SW

				I deff, have to give a big shout out to the Doc. My story is a little different in the sense that I was sleeping out of my car and completely homeless surfing SR from Starbucks parking-lots at night using a power inverter to keep my laptop running :). I wont go into specifics on what product and how it happened exactly but anyone who is uneasy buying from him.. FEAR NOT! I really cant think you enough doc, you know exactly the magnitude you have impacted my life and the struggles WE have been though. <br /><br />I look forward to a great deal more business now that operations are running for you. Things are looking up brother, just like you said they would! MUCH MUCH love to you Doc, and thank you again and again and again. <br /><br />~Ma5terCra5h

				I&#039;m surprised this thread doesn&#039;t have more posts. Doc Gonzo is my favorite seller here. Best communication and product at incredible prices. Much love for a guy who gives much love back :) I remember when he was outta commission for a minute and the prices for a kilo of a certain something were like twice as high as he has them now lol thank you doc for bringing the low prices and getting people btc&#039;s quickly and painlessly. Keep it up!
