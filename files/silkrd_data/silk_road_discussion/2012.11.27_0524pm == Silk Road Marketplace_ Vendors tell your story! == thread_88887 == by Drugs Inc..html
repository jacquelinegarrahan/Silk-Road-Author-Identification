				Any vendor or buyer that wishes to boast their story: Pride commeth before the fall<br /><br />J. Mosley, you do your part lobbying against the failed War on Drugs and maybe people would feel less criminalized and more willing to share their stories.

				please don&#039;t do this! this is some much unwanted attention that is really not needed. at the same time, if someone does email them, you can create a new tormail account for use with them. at the same time though, they should make a pgp key, just to be on the safe side. but again, please, no one do this, it would bring a ton of unwanted attention that would not be good and could lead to the downfall of sr! also, there is no j mosley on the imdb page . . . http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1688779/fullcredits#cast

				Membership has already blown up over the past couple of months. I only made a forum account because the site kept crashing recently and I was curious as to what was up. Would hate to see all of this get set on fire because everyone and their brother will use this like Amazon, and then the vendors will get labeled as dirtbags and terrorists for &quot;pushing&quot; drugs into the hands of others.

				i just want to add, i would recommend not sending an email to that account until they have posted in here again. it is possible it is someone just trolling, but the email address is real and would be sent to nat geo. if they are not expecting it, that could be a very bad thing for whoever send an email to them!!!

				not to be negative or anything but if this is real then this seems like the beginning of the end for the road. Drugs Inc would have a strong interest in doing a story on the road because it&#039;s 1. badass 2. mindblowing to most people, regardless of the effect on the road. and like other people said, when that happens LE is almost going to be forced to try their hardest to crack down on SR. even if no one cooperates, they could make it all up or take it from the forums and it would still be hugely profitable for them and get us all shit on

				If the Silk Road is an amazing place, which it is, then it is inevitable that it is going to grow and attract attention. In my opinion this is a good thing. The more people that choose to interact as free individuals the better. Get the word out.

				Cans I be on the teevees?<br /><br />Seriously though, I&#039;d rather not have another piece, but if you&#039;re going to do it do it right. Please be balanced and fair. You guys at NG are better than some kind of scare story. Talk about the harm reduction this site offers, like how people here don&#039;t deal with the violence on the street, the escrow system that helps avoid people getting scammed, how the drugs are usually good quality and can be taken at more fixed dosages, that there are other things that are totally legal that some people buy (reading materials that are illegal in foreign countries,even hard to find foods,etc..), and the sense of community. Also mention our dedicated harm reduction forums. Speak about how SR users tend to be fairly intelligent because of the technical requirements that are needed to even use it safetly. Please also understand that many people here have motivations beyond just scoring drugs. <br /><br />Shit, you can interview me over messaging, but I&#039;m not going to a clearnet email to do it. If you send me a copy of the questions in the transcript I could write down my responses and send them back. Not gonna give you any personal info or anything stupid like though.

				The piece is going to happen whether anyone likes it or not unfortunately, I think DPR should start seriously considering making major investments in updating his hardware. Guy&#039;s do you know what this means really? If DPR can prepare and get ready to handle the traffic, the Silk Road movement will be completed. The war on drugs will have been lost. We will have won. Drugs for who ever needs them, or wants them. It&#039;s a beautiful day friends. Everyone should message DPR to let him know what is going to go down. I bet he will have at least a few months to prepare. <br /><br />Much Love<br />Karma

				To the ppl who like the show: Can you recommend a good episode?! <br /><br />I watched: <br />- MDMA therapy: long time ago, can&#039;t really remember, didst leave much of an impression<br />- Hawaiian Ice: basically a docu about addiction in Hawaii. Apparently they are running out of topics. <br />- Designer Drugs: pretty stupid, sorry. To me it seems they try to convey an opinion and although I agree with them, that&#039;s not what good journalism should do. They just portrayed a very narrow one sided perspective. The &quot;RC-scene&quot; in Europe and the really educated users don&#039;t exist. They manged to unintentionally(?) show the stupidity of the war on drugs tho: kid gets caught with pod, has to do drug tests, bypasses them with legal highs, gets psychotic and kills himself. Fuck yea, &#039;murrica! Total victory.. <br /><br />Still all not really that good. Anyone got a better example?

				If a doc went out about silk road then it would &#039;force&#039; politicians to pass pretty invasive new laws, I can picture it now.

				I was watching Drugs I.N.C the other day wondering if SR would ever be put on there and which Moron on here would actually help them. Guys IMHO we should not help them at all with this Endeavor !! We all love this place and we are writing history here if we know it or not. I realize the show will run no matter what but for fuks sake dont give them any thing to fuel the fire!! We are getting more and more members all the time and i feel sure at this point every vendor and buyer on here Are all being looked at as deeply as they can. This place is like our Sanctuary why would we wanna help put it at stake and put a Bulleye&nbsp; on SR? These are just my thoughts. If you OP really is who they say they are then my reply is &quot;GET FUCKED!!&quot; And you can quote me on that for your show . <br /><br />Love AA&nbsp;

				When I see documentaries of this nature and &#039;gang leaders&#039; who opt to talk about their operation with a dishcloth over their face, I think to myself WTF?! No good can EVER come from this as I&#039;m sure everyone knows.&nbsp; However if this does get made, give me a heads up on the air date so I can load up on BTC for the inevitable BOOM&nbsp; :P

				I watched some more and sorry to say but this show (documentary is a bit too much for this) just sucks. It&#039;s always a similar pattern, basically: explain topic, show fancy interviewees, explain how topic is bad for us or a danger to us, add some addicts, done. <br /><br />I loved that H dealer in NYC tho who packed those 300 packs and was like &quot;this is real work, needs all your concentration, you can&#039;t do it on the side. Sometimes I ask myself: why not just get a job?&quot; mahaha.

				Nat Geo may not even intend to name &quot;Silk Road&quot; or &quot;TOR&quot; or &quot;Bitcoin&quot; in their show. They could instead be doing a show about &quot;a hidden website&quot; on the &quot;darknet&quot; that uses &quot;electronic currency&quot;. Of course this would still draw attention to SR indirectly, but not nearly as much. If the producers are reading this, PLEASE DO IT THIS WAY!!!<br /><br />I watch the show every week, and they never use peoples names or their gang&#039;s name, or tell where they do their business. Hopefully the same will be true for a show about drugs on the internet.

				i agree with deep987.&nbsp; sr is one of the biggest, but not the only one.. naming it outright will destroy the community and put people at risk.. national geographic should not talk in detail about btc, and the silk road name brand.<br /><br />of course we can&#039;t stop it if they do.. but not talking about it will prevent younger school kids at home watching national geographic from getting turned on to internet drug sites, and ruining their life ;)<br /><br />anyone see that ketamine episode of drugs inc?&nbsp; or the newyork episode with the molly, weed, and shroom dealers? who clearly got all their packs in the mail.&nbsp; well the ketamine episode taught me how to use safe drops.&nbsp; thanks nat geo

				The exact same thing happened on Blulight with Mephedrone; the whole thread wanted nothing to do with it but one soppy attention seeking twat turns up for an interview and lets loose with what he thinks etc. <br /><br />I will admit though that despite the narrators overtones, Drugs Inc is a very good program with excellent contacts.

				Drugs Inc is a good series, &amp; I can well believe they&#039;d be interested in doing a show on Silk Road. That said there&#039;s no reason to believe the OP is for real, its quite similar to a thread that ran a few months ago with someone from a magazine/newspaper soliciting comments and saying they were going to run a story.&nbsp; I forget which paper it was but it caused the same commotion &amp; responses that this thread has. <br /><br />The OP in that case never posted back &amp; no story ran.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this post by Drugs Inc is for real or not, really it doesn&#039;t matter - SR has made the news already, its been mentioned by a US Senator, Gawker, the Sun, Daily Mail, BBC, Australian news &amp; others. It has already made some impact on the public consciousness &amp; its only a matter of time before it makes a greater impact &amp; becomes even better known.<br /><br />Frankly thats inevitable, with the service that SR - and other darkweb drugs selling sites - provide &amp; the challenge that presents to the forces of law and order &amp; consensus view of society its an automatic controversy &amp; comment generator for the press &amp; politicians. <br /><br />Its not a matter of if SR hits the mainstream news its a matter of when.<br /><br />Personally I&#039;m not too concerned, when that happens there will be hack attempts &amp; DOS attacks &amp; SR may go down, there may be attempts to tighten BTC trading &amp; increase monitoring of postal systems but there are now serveral other sites performing the same function&nbsp; as SR(a lot since the last significant SR downtime) and the genie is out of the bottle. BTC is available OTC &amp; will be increasingly be traded off-eschange. The volume of post, and ingenuity of shippers will mean shipments will continue to get through. People will pick up &amp; adapt even if SR goes down (which is no sure thing even when it becomes public). <br /><br />Always use encryption, don&#039;t keep a lot of BTC on SR, guard your anonimity &amp; don&#039;t be stupid &amp; it won&#039;t affect you a great deal when we get the inevitable publicity.

				this kinda shit takes me to the fair...<br /><br />of course SR is going to take heat the longer it runs it doesnt take nostradamus to work this shit out, and someone will on the inside will eventually buckle, as i always say &quot;money talks and BS runs the marathon&quot; but really think about it guys, if SR shuts down or LE infiltrate SR threw public knowledge or government pressure, the community will just jump ship, we as a community have built up something great here, and if LE ever manage to take DPR down which i doubt sincerly, it il not stop what SR has started, u can cut the head of a worm but u cant stop it wiggling (metaphorically speaking as a size 9 would soon sort that shit out)...<br /><br />so drugs inc can run their story with or without the help of some weasels amongst the community, at the end of the day it will only publicise what they are trying to stop, the only downfall of this is the BTC exchange will rocket, but maybe thats what all this scare-mongering and publicity is about...? eh...? oj before all u conspiracy hunters have a hernia lol<br /><br />

				While I truly believe in the movement and ideology behind SR&#039;s continued existence and improvement, and while I would love to see SR on TV to better help the common man get access to what he wants/needs without interference from the law.. the world just isn&#039;t ready for that yet.&nbsp; All it will do is cause a panic to all the white people out there who think all drugs are bad (even though most of them are on xanax or klonopin or something), and then it&#039;s only a matter of time before SR ends up on an episode of Law and Order SVU or some shit where all they talk about is how SR and sites like it put money in the pockets of the child pornographers and shit.<br /><br />No, no, no.&nbsp; We&#039;ve got a long road ahead of us before the world is ready to accept the truth behind SR.&nbsp; Stand strong brothers, someday we&#039;ll be able to be more open about the awesomness of this place, but not for now.

				&quot;Drugs, Inc. is&nbsp; an internationally syndicated&nbsp; documentary television series on the National Geographic Channel and NatGeo World that explores global narcotics production and trafficking. The series features drug dealers, recreational users, and addicts, as well as professionals in the fields of substance abuse, drug rehabilitation, and criminal justice.&quot;<br /><br />I am missing the &quot;as well as professionals in the fields of substance use&quot;.<br /><br />Some stuff on SR can really cure people from chronic depression for example, or PTSD. If you&#039;re going to do a documentary please do something with that as well. Otherwise it is just monkey watching for the people who hate drugs. And a bit interesting for people who recreationally use drugs. Depending on which drugs, a lot of addicts will not see the documentary at all.<br />Even I will probably never see it because I don&#039;t watch the brainwashing box anymore ;)

				Obviously if they want to do it, they can but there could also be consequences...<br /><br />ALL the natgeo staff from the interns to the producers could be DOX&#039;d<br />Believe me natgeo, your servers arn&#039;t secure and you could get a free security audit.&nbsp; You may want to ask your security team what terms like &quot;botnet&quot; and &quot;DDoS&quot; and SEO of DOX and other embarassing tibits mean.&nbsp; It may be good for you and your co-workers not to swat or shall I say, stick your dick directly in a wasps nest.<br /><br />Please google &quot;HB Gary&quot; before continuing...&nbsp; While I agree it really would make for a great episode, we don&#039;t need this community distroyed.<br /><br />an eye for an eye, a DoS for a DoS<br /><br />If you fuck with the Internet the Internet will fuck right back with you...
