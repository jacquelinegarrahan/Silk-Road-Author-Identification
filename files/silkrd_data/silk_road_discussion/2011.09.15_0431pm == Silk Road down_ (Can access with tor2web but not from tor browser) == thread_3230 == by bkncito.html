				Hey there, I&#039;m getting 504 TTL expired errors when trying to access the main page on SR (http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php)<br />Can anyone else confirm? Suggestions?<br /><br />thanks!<br /><br />----<br />EDIT: Tried accessing with tor2web.org and it worked, I tested an old login that I had and it logged ok, but I&#039;m somewhat reluctant to enter my true login details since I have bitcoins, orders, etc on that account. Is tor2web dangerous? why can&#039;t I access from the tor browser?<br />

				1. Reinstall your TorBundle with Portable Firefox/Aurora whatever<br /><br />2. Click Use New Identity and check the page until your IP has been tor&#039;d (anonymized) this should help with the 504&#039;s<br /><br />ï£¿L75<br /><br />EDIT: NOOOOO GET RID OF TOR.WEB NEVER USE IT AGAIN! ONLY USE THE SIGNED TORBROWSER BUNDLE OR VIDALIA PANEL.

				Noooooo!&nbsp; Never use tor2web.&nbsp; Yes it&#039;s dangerous -- now your ISP, or whoever you used to connect to the Internet, has a record of your IP address.&nbsp; If you cant get to SilkRoad through Tor then stop Tor on the Vidalia panel, and then restart it again.&nbsp; Restarting will build a newer, hopefully faster, connection.

				For those who are browsing the archive,<br />Topic starter wrote;<br />when trying to access the main page on SR (http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php)<br />L(ulzz) ? !<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php<br />Ain&#039;t the main site!<br />There should be the word silkroad in the url/domain, with (Visual Basic) -&gt; vb5p(izza&#039;s and)3r(etour)<br /><br />Indeed, the tor2web option is not save.<br />Read the warning that comes along.<br /><br />Lately the real main-site is giving code 500 error.<br /><br />That&#039;s a good thing.<br />&nbsp;Now you don&#039;t have to worry anymore if L.E, agentcy&#039;s are using tor2web to make a list of the real ip of the members of S.R.<br /><br />Not the question, but not off topic either...;<br /><br />The firefox add-on of &quot;&quot;anonymox&quot;&quot; has no tor option anymore.<br />That&#039;s a good thing too, for the same reason.

				For what it&#039;s worth the site has been running great all day. Not sure what tor2web is but it seems like you should probably ditch it.

				No idea what tor2web is, but the Tor bundle has recently been updated. Go and grab that.

				@wasta This thread was originally from 2011, when the URL was indeed the ian... version, before they got the vanity silkroadvb5piz3r address.&nbsp; Not sure why this thread was resurrected, referring to an outage in 2011, but the URL wasn&#039;t always silkroadvb5piz3r--they changed it to that to help prevent phishing, since I imagine it&#039;s difficult for a phishing site to get a similar URL that also has the phrase silkroad in it.<br /><br />Also, Tor2Web is a horrible idea if you are connecting from an IP that you own or are associated with.&nbsp; But I sometimes use Tor2Web when I&#039;m on public wifi (not for SR).&nbsp; The thing is if Silk Road is working on Tor2Web, then it&#039;s not down, it&#039;s something with your connection.&nbsp; Try closing and restarting Tor.&nbsp; If SR were down, no one would be able to access it, not even the Tor2Web proxy.
