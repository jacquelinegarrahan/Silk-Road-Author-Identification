				Lets suppose i am LE. <br /><br />And lets say you (SR users, SR forum members) download the movie from a torrent site, or even worse, watch the movie in an online place hosts movies... using your clearnet browser... <br /><br />Don&#039;t i have the technology to find out the IP addresses that searched for that movie on google TONIGHT, that downloaded the movie from torrent site TONIGHT, or that watched that movie on the online place.. tonight??<br /><br />It would be a shame for just watching a movie today , to lead each individual to getting spied from government.&nbsp; I do not think this is a good idea...<br /><br />Suppose the LE&nbsp; finds out that today, X numbers of IP addresses watched that film, or tried to. That is it. These IP are automatically on the black list, and are connected to being an SR user, or on the very least a member on the forum. You are being watched...<br /><br />I think, this is a bad idea, with all respect.

				I have had this exact question myself, however there are also probably loads of other random people just randomly watching it as well. <br /><br />You can&#039;t go track down each of those people.<br /><br />They can however search your browsing history on the clearnet for links.

				They&#039;re spying on you regardless. Even if they went through all that trouble and harnessed the power of the No Such Agency to zero in on everyone who searched and/or watched the movie.. that proves.. nothing!! Watching a movie isn&#039;t a crime, even if it&#039;s watching it at the same time as Dread Pirate Roberts.<br /><br />Prosecutor: Your honor, the defendant watched a movie with the Dread Pirate Roberts on Silk Road movie night, throw the book at him<br />Judge:&nbsp; :o

				It doesn&#039;t even require anywhere near NSA level attacker. Just requires me to go map the swarm of all the torrent sites hosting this file. Hope no vendors download and watch it and comment on it because I can see if any of the IP addresses I grabbed from a torrent swarm correlate with the known shipping location of a vendor. Certainly hope DPR doesn&#039;t download it via a torrent either. I do think this is a serious security risk.

				Same debate broke out about the V for Vendetta night last year. I just looked at TPB and there are about 250 seeders + leechers, so yeah that is a pretty small swarm if a few hundred Silk Roaders start downloading the movie. Ideally you would have done it already or you have a really trusted VPN.<br />

				Also noise can be filtered even by me since they have watched two movies now. Maybe there are some other not SR people downloading the movie today as well, but how many of them downloaded movie 1 on the first day and move 2 on the second day? If I monitor the torrent swarms I can gather two crowds now and an intersection attack will reveal the people unique to both, who are almost certainly SR members. At this point I can wait to see if anybody comments on it and then if they are vendors I can try to correlate their shipping location with an IP address. <br /><br />The same threat risks for book ordering too unfortunately, unless you are buying the books with cash at some mom and pop book store. If you grabbing the books off Amazon don&#039;t be surprised when the FBI gets a list of everybody who ordered every book on the list of books to read, it creates a high entropy fingerprint when you match that to the timing of the posted threads and can be used to identify SR users. My biggest concern would be it narrowing DPR&#039;s crowd significantly, even if they get 100 people they detect as involved in these events they could consider surveillance on all of them if they suspect DPR is one of them.

				I also agree that much of the SR community seems to lack an understanding of intelligence gathering in general.&nbsp; &quot;There is nothing illegal about &lt;blank&gt;&quot; is the argument I hear all the time.&nbsp; Intelligence gathering is about putting PIECES of things together.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t you guys ever do those math problems in school where you have to figure out who is sitting next to who on the ferris wheel?&nbsp; Or played the game Clue?&nbsp; Now think about how challenging those problems might have seemed, and consider the fact that modern technology makes solving those problems about a million times easier, and that people are getting paid big money to solve them.&nbsp; Or consider the fact that if you say nothing, you&#039;re saying something.<br /><br />Stop living in your fantasy land of your activity being hidden in the noise.&nbsp; In reality, unless you&#039;ve got advanced training in intelligence gathering, you are not hidden, you are just lucky that there are a lot of criminals and far fewer resources to deal with them all.

				I feel like this is a bit of a overly paranoid attempt at scaring someone.<br /><br />Look, lets be honest here: SR has been around for a long time. LE knows its here. If they wanted a convoluted method of &quot;getting into us&quot; through some random long-stranded pathway of turning a torrent IP into a mass arrest of SR, they&#039;d have done so. I&#039;ll believe a fabricated moonlanding over that ludicrous.<br /><br />That aside, there is one thing I do disagree with on the movie post. Come on people. We are smart here, or at least we pretend to be. Don&#039;t go posting a pirate bay URL when you know its no longer run by the pirate bay, and even they have been indicted. If you want to get movie torrents, there are plenty of ways to get into trackers that are hidden and non-public, if you just look for them. There are even regular private trackers, like tehconnection, that simply have membership requirements. This is leagues better than telling someone to go to the run-of-the-mill torrent trackers and set themselves up.<br /><br />Besides, the courts have been dealing with DMCA trolls. The era of mass-john-doe filings is over, thanks to Prenda et. al.<br /><br />And if you&#039;re truly afraid of these things, its very simple: rent it, buy it, borrow it. It&#039;s a movie. What exactly are we getting so worked up over for?<br /><br />If we are talking about the &quot;tracking of active viewers&quot; type thing, we are not the only group who came up with a movie night - and we are not the only people who like Philip K Dick. We are not the only dissidents, we are not the only delinquent degenerates. If you spend 5min googling through public calendars, you&#039;ll find plenty of other A Scanner Darkley viewings. What do you propose they intend on doing about that?<br /><br />That being said, let&#039;s look at another avenue: if they want to watch you, they&#039;re going to watch you. They aren&#039;t going to do it on a movie night. This is the 21st century. We have digital wiretaps and ISP subpoenas that record constantly. Gone are the days of a stake out waiting for that phone call so you can turn on the magnetic tape.
