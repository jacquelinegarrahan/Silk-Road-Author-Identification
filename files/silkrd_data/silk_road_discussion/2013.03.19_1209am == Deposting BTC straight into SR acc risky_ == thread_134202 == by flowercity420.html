Get them to send the coins to your own wallet, either a bitcoin client or an online temporary wallet.<br /><br />Then, send to bitcoin fog, and do the funky chicken thing there to send to your SR address. You won&#039;t be sorry, and you might just be sorry if you get coins sent to SR after using paypal, of all things.<br /><br />goblin

				And to answer the original question, yes it is risky. Especially straight to SR. BTC has a ledger that anyone can use to track where the BTC came from and went to. SR has a tumbler but they would still have a direct link proving you bought *something* on SR.<br /><br />If you use a several wallets and coinfog then at most someone can say is that you bought BTC. But no idea where or what the money was spent on.<br /><br />You can do better buy using an anon buying method like bitinstant or blue sky traders

				Inigo has no fucking clue what he is talking about!! As to your original question it is not risky AT ALL!!!!<br /><br />And unlike someone that has been here weeks and has 70 post.... I have been here a year and KNOW what I am talking about!<br /><br />And though Nomad was correct...he was backwards...it is totally ok to BUY btc that way as you will get the coin...the reverse charges would pertain to the seller..it is easy for the BUYER to claim he didn&#039;t authorize he didn&#039;t want the charge and get it reversed so the SELLER would get the charge back...but as a buyer you would be ok... So he should have said never sell btc on ebay....but again this is not what the OP even asked..<br /><br />What the OP asked is if it is ok to send coins straight to your SR account...and that answer is YES!&nbsp; Is it risky..the answer is NO.<br />

				@Gob..(hello)<br /><br />I have been here over 1 year and I have yet to ever have one person be able to state their case as to why this would be risky. So can you please explain why it is risky to send a deposit straight to your SR wallet?<br /><br />Thanks I am looking forward to it!!!

				Too be honest, it does not matter. <br />Bitcoin transactions are made to be anonymous, -plus most of transactions you&#039;re doing are with tor. <br />You can waste money like these other members by using bitcoin fog but you really don&#039;t need to. <br /><br />But hey, do whatever makes you feel better.

No. <br /><br />The easy thing to do is to have at least one online virtual wallet (same BTC address each time or better, a new one each time) that<br />you access via TOR to receive/send and vice versa. Why is that?<br /><br />Well, the legal issue at stake is trying to identify the owner of the wallet. While the wallet may have been used to receive BTC<br />via SR, who was it that owned it, received BTC from SR and then sent BTC onward to you? Without that knowledge LEO cannot<br />directly connect you with SR. The owner/user of the TOR accessed intermediary online wallet is anonymous. Therefore, no viable <br />case can be made against you given that transacting in BTC is perfectly legal. <br /><br /><br />*TL;DR - a TOR accessed BTC virtual wallet acting as intermediary = anonymous = plausible deniability. Who owns the wallet?<br /><br /><br />Note also that, sending BTC directly to SR or receiving BTC directly from SR doesn&#039;t mean all that much to LEO since unless<br />they can use it as corroborating evidence, there&#039;s no proof that it was you who sent BTC to yourself from SR or that, in the absence<br />of physical contraband, that you used the BTC you sent to SR to purchase the illicit item(s) in question. <br /><br /><br />*TL;DR - sending BTC direct to SR is fine so long as no physical contraband can be used as evidence to corroborate the affair.<br /><br />Recall the axiom, &quot;possession is 9/10ths of the law.&quot; If SR is ever compromised, the fact that you bought illicit items doesn&#039;t make for<br />a case against you unless you also take possession of the item you bought and are caught doing so either at time of delivery or <br />subsequent to a warrant search.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />At the end of the day and beginning of it, I might add, it&#039;s those of us who sell to a buyer that have more of a concern about security.<br />After all, it is the seller who attracts the most attention and has to deal with BTC extraction, justification and conversion into fiat currency. <br /><br />Regards, <br /><br />♔ Sir Pillington<br /><br /><br /><br />●ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ●<br /><br />The Gentleman Lords of Pharmaceuticals.<br />Serving US Patrons from within the US.<br /><br />●ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ●<br />

So they have your SR deposit addresses. They can easily check where the deposits to this address originated (SR mixer can&#039;t help here since it takes place after the deposit). Have in mind that they can easily get logs of every address used for most of the biggest online wallets and btc exchange sites, seems they already do that with mtGox. <br />This will probably never happen for small transactions , but I am sure they re gonna go after the bigger players if they ever get our addresses.<br /><br />So why can&#039;t you be a little more careful with that process? It doesn&#039;t cost that much anyway.

I am going to assume form here on out that &quot;they&quot; is Leo (law enforcement officer). So lets give you this one and say there is no way to tell if they can &quot;discover it&quot;&nbsp; or not.<br /><br />So buying btc is totally legal yet you believe you should not buy btc and send it to SR directly. And when I asked you to give your reasons you responded with this.....<br /><br />You did say---I don&#039;t think this question can be answered definitively.&nbsp; ( the question is if you should or should not send btc straight to SR)<br /><br />So that means that there is actually no reason at all to not send your coins directly to silk road. NONE. In fact I asked you why you believe you should not and you said this----<br /><br />Your first paragraph is------That you have researched all over and can&#039;t find anything that say&#039;s they(LEO) could find out that the address belongs to Silk Road. <br /><br />Your second paragraph is-- why take a chance use bitfog<br /><br />Your third paragraph is--- that the often mentioned tumbler actually applies to withdraws. And that in a blockchain there is the amount and an address(that is your SR one) so for that reason go to your first paragraph and we know that just states that there is nothing either way!<br /><br />Then you end it with you are far from an expert...but your points are on track!!! You had no points at all!! NONE<br /><br />What points? That with all your research you cant find anything that states they can figure out your address belongs to SR and that the tumbler applies to withdraws!! That&#039;s all you said.. The crazy part is I think you actually believed you stated a case as to why you should not send your coins straight to SR. Yet in the very first paragraph you say you have researched all over the place and you could find nothing! <br /><br />As you know I have nothing against you.. I make a post saying it is totally ok to send coins straight to your SR address and and you came into this thread and responded that you disagree.....I asked you to tell me why and this was your answer... You said nothing. Not one thing that would give reason to not do it. <br />&nbsp;<br />I understand better safe then sorry and I understand the concept &quot;well it can&#039;t hurt&quot; so take the extra step. But in this case(buying coins and sending them straight to your SR wallet) there is no chance. There is no risk. And there is no reason at all you should not just send the coins straight there. <br /><br />But there is an upside! <br /><br />Time. <br /><br />There have been more pos/threads&nbsp; made in this forum from people frustrated waiting for the confirmations to get their coin and when you read further...there is always one guy who is giving the advice that they should use bit-fog or some other washing site before sending the coins to SR And they always say it in a way like &quot; OMG you better use bit-fog and not just send the coins straight to SR!!! Don&#039;t mess with fire&quot;&nbsp; and like yourself, they in no way, shape or form have anything to back up what they are saying. NOTHING. They just &quot;heard it&quot;. Like the crazies that say &quot; don&#039;t check USPS tracking from tor... it will flag it!&quot; I mean 100% total LIE and it is passed around like the game&nbsp; &quot;telephone&quot; and the people that are now passing it around have no fucking clue what they are even saying! Its worse then an urban myth! At least those have SOMETHING... this &quot;make sure and wash your btc before you send it to SR&quot; is 100% complete BULLSHIT! And the number one reason they can come up with is &quot;why take the chance&quot;.<br /><br />People keep posting in threads they know nothing about. These threads used to be a great place for information. Now they are complete shit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />All I want is to help the community be better. And one of the ways to make this shit hole come back to its glory where you could come and get truthful information is to eliminate the total bullshit. This is TOTAL BULLSHIT. These forums used to be such a great place...and now they are total shit. People just say things with no factual backing at all. They comment in post they know nothing about..just to comment. Someone will ask &quot; has anyone used ABC for XXX?&quot; and there will be 3 responses from people that will give their opinion and they have never used ABC or XXX. They will say things like &quot; I tried something like it once and it fucked me up..be careful, let us know how you liked it..hey do you have .003 btc? I am short for my order today&quot;.. The other post will say &quot; My buddy tried it and he loved it but I would never risk it. be careful&quot;&nbsp; This is the type of shit that is on here now. It is sad actually. People will make threads in the completely wrong forum and they will post something they have no personal knowledge at all about..doesn&#039;t stop them!&nbsp; Or they will chime in and say &quot;DONT FE&quot; wow...good one..thanks for the insight! Thank god you are a member.<br />&nbsp;

This is your sentence---<br /><br /><br />&quot;Guys not using GPG have been here over a year , that doesn&#039;t make them smart or knowledgeable and it doesn&#039;t mean encrypting is useless&quot;<br /><br />You read that and tell me there shouldn&#039;t be another word after GPG....?&nbsp; And I was confused because you say &quot; and it doesn&#039;t mean encryption is useless&quot;&nbsp; ...um ok..where did that come from?&nbsp; And who implied that not using GPG for over a year makes them smart? or knowledgeable? and again it seems you throw encryption is useless in there from left field.<br /><br />I totally disagree that me being here for 1 year doesn&#039;t mean I know any better...I think it is safe to say that I know more about SR and how this place works from being here for 1 year then someone that has been here for weeks. But just being here a year is not the defying thing. Me being a vendor here for 1 year and mailing 1000&#039;s of packages and having 1000&#039;s of btc makes me someone that knows a lot more then your average forum user. <br /><br />&quot;like many older forum members who think to skip security&quot;.... well so far in your very first sentence you have yet to be correct! Your first&nbsp; 5 words....no you were not..your next 13 words--you being here for a year doesn&#039;t mean you know any better actually-- actually it does. Your next gem--- like many other old members who think it&#039;s ok to skip security measures like GPG because they haven&#039;t been caught yet-- you could not be more wrong(well you could...look at your first couple points) many &quot;older&quot; members are in fact fanatics about gpg! So I am not at all like many...I am one of the few who has my opinion...Jesus, when in the sentence are you going to say something accurate?? Caught yet? Meaning if I were to get caught I wuld then want to use GPG? Yea that makes sense(except the total opposite)&nbsp; That was your first sentence!! You ended it with the gem &quot;so they must be right&quot; in reference to since they have not been caught yet...where did you come up with this shit?<br /><br />As to your second sentence...<br /><br />Just because you can&#039;t think of a reason to cover your bitcoin transactions doesn&#039;t mean that there isn&#039;t one.<br /><br />What the fuck are you on? <br /><br />&quot;I can&#039;t think of a reason to cover my btc transactions????&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to cover my btc transactions.. I don&#039;t even do btc transactions!&nbsp; Where did you come up with this nonsense?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Do yourself a favor and delete your post!&nbsp; What are you even talking about when you say I can&#039;t cover my btc transactions? <br /><br />So go ahead genius and come up with something witty and smart to why you wrote something that is totally inaccurate.

We disagree and we are going to state our cases and&nbsp; even if we still disagree we wont call the other one an idiot. We are going to show how you can have totally different opinions and still be cool with each other :)<br /><br />So you said you disagree......EXPLAIN WHY?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah, OK. It&#039;s good to state one&#039;s positions. First is there is no really sure way of knowing whether sending coins to an SR address can&#039;t somehow be &quot;discovered&quot;. I have researched this all over and I get no definite answer one way or the other. Is there something in the algorythms or in the composition of the address itself that can identify a site? I don&#039;t think this question can be answered definitively.<br /><br />In that case, and being that the OP is buying coins with a very unsecure and identifying method, I say why take the chance? Mix the coins up and then send them there.<br /><br />Also, the tumbler that is so often mentioned, well that&#039;s (again, as far as I know) only when withdrawing coins. In the blockchain when depositing, any given coin amount sent appears along with the SR address in question. So for this, see two paragraphs above. But when withdrawing, there is no way to tell the coins came from the user&#039;s SR address,&nbsp; as shown in the blockchain. Yes, I do realize that following my logic, if an address can be identified as coming from a certain site, then there is a risk even here.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I always advise to use a real mixing service like bitcoin fog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion).<br /><br />Admitting that I am far from an expert, I think my points are pretty much on track.<br /><br />Saludos, amigo!<br /><br />goblin<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />WOW...You think your points are pretty much on track???&nbsp; &nbsp;So I will break down what you said...<br /><br />Here is your first sentence--<br /><br />&nbsp;First is there is no really sure way of knowing whether sending coins to an SR address can&#039;t somehow be &quot;discovered&quot;.<br /><br />Ok so here you say there is no way to know if it can be discovered if&nbsp; you are sending coins to silk road. I am going to assume form here on out that &quot;they&quot; is Leo (law enforcement officer). So lets give you this one and say there is no way to tell if they can &quot;discover it&quot;&nbsp; or not.<br /><br />So buying btc is totally legal yet you believe you should not buy btc and send it to SR directly. And when I asked you to give your reasons you responded with this.....<br /><br />You did say---I don&#039;t think this question can be answered definitively.&nbsp; ( the question is if you should or should not send btc straight to SR)<br /><br />So that means that there is actually no reason at all to not send your coins directly to silk road. NONE. In fact I asked you why you believe you should not and you said this----<br /><br />Your first paragraph is------That you have researched all over and can&#039;t find anything that say&#039;s they(LEO) could find out that the address belongs to Silk Road. <br /><br />Your second paragraph is-- why take a chance use bitfog<br /><br />Your third paragraph is--- that the often mentioned tumbler actually applies to withdraws. And that in a blockchain there is the amount and an address(that is your SR one) so for that reason go to your first paragraph and we know that just states that there is nothing either way!<br /><br />Then you end it with you are far from an expert...but your points are on track!!! You had no points at all!! NONE<br /><br />What points? That with all your research you cant find anything that states they can figure out your address belongs to SR and that the tumbler applies to withdraws!! That&#039;s all you said.. The crazy part is I think you actually believed you stated a case as to why you should not send your coins straight to SR. Yet in the very first paragraph you say you have researched all over the place and you could find nothing! <br /><br />As you know I have nothing against you.. I make a post saying it is totally ok to send coins straight to your SR address and and you came into this thread and responded that you disagree.....I asked you to tell me why and this was your answer... You said nothing. Not one thing that would give reason to not do it. <br />&nbsp;<br />I understand better safe then sorry and I understand the concept &quot;well it can&#039;t hurt&quot; so take the extra step. But in this case(buying coins and sending them straight to your SR wallet) there is no chance. There is no risk. And there is no reason at all you should not just send the coins straight there. <br /><br />But there is an upside! <br /><br />Time. <br /><br />There have been more pos/threads&nbsp; made in this forum from people frustrated waiting for the confirmations to get their coin and when you read further...there is always one guy who is giving the advice that they should use bit-fog or some other washing site before sending the coins to SR And they always say it in a way like &quot; OMG you better use bit-fog and not just send the coins straight to SR!!! Don&#039;t mess with fire&quot;&nbsp; and like yourself, they in no way, shape or form have anything to back up what they are saying. NOTHING. They just &quot;heard it&quot;. Like the crazies that say &quot; don&#039;t check USPS tracking from tor... it will flag it!&quot; I mean 100% total LIE and it is passed around like the game&nbsp; &quot;telephone&quot; and the people that are now passing it around have no fucking clue what they are even saying! Its worse then an urban myth! At least those have SOMETHING... this &quot;make sure and wash your btc before you send it to SR&quot; is 100% complete BULLSHIT! And the number one reason they can come up with is &quot;why take the chance&quot;.<br /><br />People keep posting in threads they know nothing about. These threads used to be a great place for information. Now they are complete shit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />All I want is to help the community be better. And one of the ways to make this shit hole come back to its glory where you could come and get truthful information is to eliminate the total bullshit. This is TOTAL BULLSHIT. These forums used to be such a great place...and now they are total shit. People just say things with no factual backing at all. They comment in post they know nothing about..just to comment. Someone will ask &quot; has anyone used ABC for XXX?&quot; and there will be 3 responses from people that will give their opinion and they have never used ABC or XXX. They will say things like &quot; I tried something like it once and it fucked me up..be careful, let us know how you liked it..hey do you have .003 btc? I am short for my order today&quot;.. The other post will say &quot; My buddy tried it and he loved it but I would never risk it. be careful&quot;&nbsp; This is the type of shit that is on here now. It is sad actually. People will make threads in the completely wrong forum and they will post something they have no personal knowledge at all about..doesn&#039;t stop them!&nbsp; Or they will chime in and say &quot;DONT FE&quot; wow...good one..thanks for the insight! Thank god you are a member.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly.

				Just set up a blockchain.info wallet for the transfer. It is very easy. They also have a bitcoin washer for 1.5% if you are extra concerned about your funds being tracked to SR. It is better to be safe than sorry I guess. I won&#039;t enter into the necessary vs. not necessary debate but the info is there if you want it. GL man. :)
