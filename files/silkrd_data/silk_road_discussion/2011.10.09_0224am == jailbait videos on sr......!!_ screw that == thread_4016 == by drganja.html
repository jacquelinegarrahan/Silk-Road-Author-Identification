				So i was just looking in the digital goods section and saw a post for &quot;jailbait&quot; (child porn) videos from DrawkwarD. this makes me sick. i dont think that we need this on silk road. perverts that buy that kind of stuff shouldnt be on this site imo. my daugter got molested by a predator and ever since im very creeped out about this kind of stuff. those are peoples sons and daughters... thats so fucked up. child porn should be removed from sr permanently! Also, im short .2 btc for an order. if anyone could spot me this for a few days until i get my next batch of btc it would be much appreciated and i will double whatever you give me even .1 btc lol sorry to be a mooch, i just dont get more btc till next week when i get payed.

				Hmmm... there was a jailbait magazine back in the day that advertised barely legal teens.&nbsp; They supposedly were 18.&nbsp; Hopefully this is the case here, but there&#039;s only one way to find out, and I&#039;M not going there.<br /><br />Child porn is just about the worse thing we could find here, and where it&#039;s against the rules, I suppose you could PM SR about it and get him to check the listing.<br /><br />*shudder*

				yeah, that&#039;s the thing is drawing the distinction -<br /><br />CP is definitely banned form SR,<br /><br />but &#039;Jailbait&#039; can often mean teen girls who are past puberty and/or &#039;barely legal&#039;.<br /><br />which, call it scummy if you will, but I personally can at least acknowledge that it&#039;s a gray area.

				TC you&#039;re an idiot.&nbsp; Jailbait =/= child porn.&nbsp; Anyway, I know for a fact that all the girls in that file are 18+&nbsp; I just called it jailbait b/c sounded enticing.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry your daughter was molested but don&#039;t go trying to get my listings taken down just because of your personal vandetta against pedophiles.&nbsp;

				hey man that is not cool to even say why would you apologize for someones daughter getting molested sarcastically ? says a lot about you perhaps you should just relist the item with a different name and get a new business pitch obviously isnt working well with some of the community<br /><br />You should take note of this instead of coming here and talking shit to someone who obviously misunderstood your title poor choice of words and are you saying you dont mind pedophiles? perhaps when you have kids you can grow up next to one and you will most likely reconsider what you said. coming here to call someone out and possible customers to who is reading is more idiotic instead of being a good vendor and talking like a reasonable person<br />&nbsp;

				Major edit:<br /><br />Yeah, I would recommend just taking down the listing and putting up another one in Digital Goods/XXX and adding the caveat &quot;All persons depicted are 18 or older&quot; just to avoid any confusion. As it stands, if you&#039;re claiming they&#039;re all 18+, then they&#039;re not jailbait, and frankly that&#039;s false advertising.<br /><br />This raises a couple questions, though. Should jailbait porn be allowed on SR?<br /><br />CP is obviously a no.<br />Regular porn is allowed.<br /><br />The age of consent varies from country to country. Should porn with 14 year olds be allowed? 15? 16? 17?<br /><br />Where do we draw the line, if we obviously won&#039;t look to the law to determine what products are allowed?

				honestly. the line is drawn at 18. If you are watching child porn and getting off to it you need to seriously find some help. <br /><br />Most child porn is not of consent so that is regardless in a situation like this these CHILDREN. are taken and forced to do it just change the title of your listing and move on <br /><br />this is sickening to even talk about

				I am in agreement with mistersketch in that most child porn is pretty much forced. If its forced its just called flat out rape and people who get off on rape are otherwise known as rapists. Who they rape is irrelevant because I am sure videos of women actually getting raped would also be a massive no go here along with actual snuff films.

				I prefer SR to take the better safe than sorry approach and limit porn to 18+ simply because jailbait is a contentious subject. I know it&#039;s legal but there are too many people who confuse it with CP and it&#039;s better to not have to deal with fallout. It&#039;s too easy to give an entity bad PR by accusing it of hosting CP, even if it&#039;s not technically that.<br /><br />Just my two (bit) cents.
