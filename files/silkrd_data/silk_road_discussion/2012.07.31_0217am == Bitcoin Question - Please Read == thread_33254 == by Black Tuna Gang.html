				Hi<br /><br />I am trying to wrap my head around what the fuck is going on but can&#039;t. I have been blazing all night. :)<br /><br />In a hedged situation, if an order is cancelled by the vendor, what happens to the buyers bitcoins?<br /><br />In an exposed situation, same question.<br /><br />If the btc are exposed but the order has not been marked in transit what happens then as it looks like the prices are now half price.<br /><br />Somebody please explain :)<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />BTG

				Ah yes, so they are. :)<br /><br />I think i only had one buyer finalise early at a ridiculously low price. In this situation is it acceptable to give a refund and ask him to start again.<br /><br />I also have 3 orders come in at the ridiculous prices. If they are cancelled will the buyer lose out?<br /><br />THanks

I&#039;d expect most if not all vendors will be cancelling any orders placed during said time (when btc was ~$19).

What if the buyer had bought his coins at the higher price? But thought &quot;fuck it I need the drugs and it ll work out the same anyway. &quot; then you cancel his order and he has to pay more now his coins have dropped in value?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You have to ask yourself if the BTC market had fluctuated in your favour would you be cancelling so as not to overcharge your customers?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think whether you choose hedged or exposed you have to stick with your choice and take what comes. If your gonna start casncelling orders when it doesn&#039;t go your way it&#039;s not fair on your customers. Fair enough if there were loads and you were gonna lose serious money but if there&#039;s just one order? Would you still make profit on the order?
