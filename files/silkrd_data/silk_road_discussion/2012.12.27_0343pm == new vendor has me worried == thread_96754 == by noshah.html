				Thought I&#039;d try out a new vendor.&nbsp; Seemed to have a good price, I feel stupid now but FE&#039;ed early on deal.&nbsp; 2-10 days to the UK (i live in the UK) its been 12 days.&nbsp; NO sign of any goods, contacted the vendor said to be patient!&nbsp; Asked to check address but he said he cant because its automatically deleted by SR after the order is taken (is this true)?<br /><br />I know they can&#039;t get my cash back for me (I&#039;ve already been phished and cleaned out), but I don&#039;t know if to listen to him or go to SR Admin?<br /><br />I&#039;m not having a good time on SR at the moment.&nbsp; Any advice?

				Ouch... sorry to hear this man! :(<br /><br />Who is the vendor? Don&#039;t hesitate to disclose the vendor&#039;s name. If you&#039;re having trouble with a vendor, the public should know about it so they can decide if they want to order or not from them. It can save some people from losing out on money.<br /><br />What was the product? How much did you pay?

				I&#039;d say wait till day 16 or so and if the vendor isn&#039;t being helpful air it out.&nbsp; Worst thing to do is air someone out and have the package arrive.&nbsp; Finalizing early is nice for the vendor but at 12 transactions theres no reason to FE, especially for a new vendor.&nbsp; If its a vendor you trust and have done transactions with before then sure, or if its a sale, I guess.&nbsp; I still suggest staying in escrow thats the whole beauty of the Road.&nbsp; But be safe, aware and practice proper habits on this site and you wont have problems.&nbsp; But be patient for now and pray you didn&#039;t get shafted with no lube.&nbsp; And if you did air the fucker out

It was your choice to F.E and to read you&#039;ve done this 12 times previously is crazy! Once you F.E, SR Support will not help you. Finalizing your order is like a receipt, it&#039;s the acknowledgement you&#039;ve received the package and were happy with everything.

				He asked you to FE...or you just did it cause you are a nice guy.<br /><br />either way if you got scammed, your BTC is gone. Noone can help with that, but if he is truly a &quot;new&quot; vendor (less then 35 transactions) then he can not ask you to FE. You could &quot;report vendor&quot; on him for that...but I get the feeling that this is not the case here.<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				Just to set the record straight. I do not require F.E. for all orders, I only require F.E. for orders of 1oz or more. If you don&#039;t want to F.E. order less than 1oz. Most vendors require F.E. for Bulk orders. There is to much opportunity for buyers to abuse the escrow and resolution systems to scam vendors on bulk orders.

				Hi,<br /><br />Just a side note, I get so sick of buyers crapping on other usually newer buyers for FE&#039;ing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I live in a country where if you want an International order you pretty much a ZERO choice but to FE or pay TOP TOP dollar on local less variety products.&nbsp; Several reputable vendors are making n00b buyers FE.<br /><br />For the two O/S orders I made I had to FE.&nbsp; I do agree though that if you have to go with a vendor that insists you FE, only agree if they have positive forum reviews (from regular posters), +300 positive transactions etc.<br /><br />Having said that, one of the vendors I FE&#039;d for was well regarded on the Road, +300 pos transactions and said that my package was sent last week.&nbsp; Said vendors account has now disappeared and I don&#039;t have my package.....&nbsp; &nbsp;My point being, even with the reputable vendors there is no guarantee, but again, most vendors will only deal with n00bs or certain countries via FE.<br /><br />I would like Silk Road to look into changing the FE transaction rulings.
