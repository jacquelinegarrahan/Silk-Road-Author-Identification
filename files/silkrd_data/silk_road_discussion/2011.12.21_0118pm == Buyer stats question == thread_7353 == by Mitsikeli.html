				I have ordered 7 items. 3 of them i think was in one order. So lets say 5. One of them never reached me so i got full refund. And my stats now say about 45% refund rate? Isnt it quite big?? How is it calculated?

				I had the same issue after my first two orders -- one was refunded 100%, the other, completely successful.&nbsp; This seems like it should be a 50% rate.&nbsp; However, since my refunded order cost substantially more than my successful one, I ended up with around an 85% refund rate.&nbsp; I believe the refund rate is calculated by dividing the (amount refunded) by the (total amount of all your orders).&nbsp; Hope this helps! <br /><br />Also, a quick shout out to LSDirect for actually agreeing to do business with me despite my horrendous refund rate. Keep up the good work!<br />

				Thanks for the answer. I thought of something like this but i am quite sure it should be smaller anyway....Thats quite bad. Cause now even a guy i have received succesfully 2 orders told me to finalize early...And price was small.Anyway...

				Yeah it goes on % of money refunded not % of transactions refunded... It can take a while to work it back up again, but stick with it and you will be back with a low %.
