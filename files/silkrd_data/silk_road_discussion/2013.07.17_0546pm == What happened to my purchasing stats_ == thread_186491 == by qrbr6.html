				It only shows back as far as one year when it used to be all time back when I was on here a lot. Now it looks like I don&#039;t have such great stats (about 800 spent when it was in fact 1000s). I see this as a disadvantage to anyone who wants to come back here after a long time and not buy drugs monthly. Am I missing something here, is there a reason why this was implemented?

				Hell I am a buyer and seller and I think this is great.&nbsp; Look at all the long-time vendors who were so trusted that everyone would FE, then baaaaaam, they are gone with thousands and more than likely planned ahead and have another account with good feedback to do it all over again after a few months.&nbsp; <br /><br />Think about it, they are making bank selling and really getting lots of fast money, with not time/work/resources involved when they go rogue.&nbsp; Keep accounts rolling like that and you always got steady income with biyearly &quot;bonuses&quot; in the form of our BTC that we gave them with trust prior to receiving out product.

				Yeah, I don&#039;t like this update. My refund rate was going down as I was having successful transactions after the refund. Now it shows up as either 0% or 17%. It also doesn&#039;t show the date registered. I like to be able to check SR and see how much money I&#039;ve spent on drugs so far in my life (just for fun). After 5 more months, I&#039;m not going to be able to do this because then it&#039;ll hit the one year mark. Grr.<br /><br />I always try to keep things in perspective. It&#039;s wonderful we have SR and I&#039;m very thankful but fuck that part of the recent updates.

				I agree, cmon people rise your hands against this cutting down your buyer stats, making you look like a newbie for vendors.<br /><br />DPR and others, before making any decisions in site working and logic, think two-three steps ahead. <br />And don&#039;t make changes, only in the name of changes. <br /><br />Please return as it was, full all-time statistics, so vendors could see who is newbie or who is the man&nbsp; 8)

				This is beyond fucked up, I do get the one month, three month, one year break down but for us to lose our total stats? Very bad move! Im already down 5 transactions and 15k....I have not had to order for a while as ive been focused on other things that did not require me to use SR. So this means in a few more weeks i&#039;ll lose the last of my stats and end up with a 1 year account with a clean transaction history or one that does not do me justice as it will have only two orders or so that dont even come close to anything more then 8% total amount spent? This means when I want to deal with a very large transaction of 5k+ vendors might not want to deal with me or request me to FE which I wont.

				SERIOUS IDEA: maybe we should make an official thread titled &quot;Official thread to get purchasing stats back&quot; or something along those lines. There people could voice why they dislike it. Anybody who likes it the new way can also explain why that&#039;s so and it&#039;d all be in one area. We could include a poll too! <br /><br />I really think this is something we should try. It would be our way to peacefully protest the change. After all, DPR is here to serve us as his motto &quot;As you wish&quot; clearly states.

DPR I love you, I owe you my life as ive said before but your killing me with this!!! If you take away my stats then make vendors stick to escrow no matter amount spent or transactions! I know they wont like that but its the same us is it not? When you have high stats you get a perk, now the vendors ive used are gone or dont offer what I want anymore so I head off to a new one. This the point of SR right? waaaiiit, now they see im 1 year old an have no stats? Gee thanks!

				What I wonder is if he can roll it back or if they truly are gone. I mean in the end at worst we will have to rebuild the history which means more smaller orders, more drops, more risk but if that&#039;s what we have to do then we will do it just having to do it every year? My refund an auto fin stats where always at a zero n will remain that way so over all its more of pain in the ass for us people who abide by comment sense and proper acetic<br /><br />The issue is vendors have policy&#039;s, &quot;you must have A amount of orders or B amount of money spent or you must FE&quot;. So once our stats drop out we will have no choice to FE or look for other vendors who we may not want to deal with due to lower quality product or stealth. My whole point is if vendors can request your stats to be at a certain level then by removing our overall stats you are hurting the customers. I do like the idea of seeing what was spent in a 1 month, 3 month or 1 year time line but the overall stats must stay. Vendors have the ability to go stealth so how come customers do not? I know many people who use SR take breaks. Whats the point of making money if you cant enjoy it? Now for the other issue, if vendor see how much we have spent in a set amount of time we should be able to see how much they sold, then you can also throw out profiling into the mix as in its own little way that&#039;s what this market research type addition really is. <br /><br />As many saw my spelling and train of thought was a bit warped, sorry was a bit drunk at the time. So now that im sober I thought I&#039;d explain some more. I do hope DPR reverses this Asian grocery store policy. <br /><br />DPR &lt;3 from me to you, truly even if most of us believe the role changes hands you are a god among men. <br /><br />

				This is a big FU to all of us buyers. This is an important part of the stats that vendors judge buyers on so although I&#039;m sure there is a reason for the change it is not the one being fed to us. I&#039;m hugely upset by this as I see so many others are too. Now at least i realize I am not crazy as I&#039;ve spent close to $1,000 more than is reflected. Please reconsider this DPR. This place would not exist without buyers so our opinions should matter.

				Another reason I don&#039;t like this is because I don&#039;t buy frequently. My stats look worse because of that which I think is unfair. Just because I&#039;m not a hardcore addict means people shouldn&#039;t trust me as much? I still have the transactions, $ spent, and shit.<br /><br />Has anybody contacted the mods yet?

				I&#039;ll put it on DPR&#039;s radar so everyone can stop messaging for the time being. I&#039;m a little fuzzy on why the all time stats were removed, I think there was a kerfuffle in another thread where everyone got up in arms thinking their info was being saved and that may have prompted DPR to remove the data point.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ll draw this matter to his attention, see what happens I guess.

				Well, it does raise the issue brought up by SS of how you can differentiate one year stats from all time stats unless you keep a monthly log of these basic stats. I think as long as the transaction data is gone, people are fine with it. In other words, keeping old records around of specific transactions creates a liability in the event the transaction database is compromised, and at no real benefit because old transactions are not actionable (can&#039;t go into resolution, etc.), while simple aggregate monthly statistics, stripped of identifying info about the specific buyers, vendors, and products, will suffice to build buyer stats.<br />

				I just realized this doesn&#039;t help my situation all that much. Before stats got changed, I had a refund rate that was higher than I wanted it. It was going down because of my successful transactions. All time stats show my refund rate when it was really high. It&#039;s still better since DPR made the modification, I just wanted to point that out. Oh well.
