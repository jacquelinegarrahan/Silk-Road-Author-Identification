				...I don&#039;t have a strong IT background but have been reading the available materials for the last several hours and have started to get the gist.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a lot of language and concepts that are new to me.&nbsp; The encryption and usage of disposable email addresses, bitcoin exchange, ewallets, etc.&nbsp; I am thinking that in the process of trying to use SR, I will f*** up and somehow find myself in trouble and/or out lots of $$.&nbsp; How can I tell if I am in over my head or just having nerves?&nbsp; Are there others out there who were relative SR boneheads when they started and are now champions of this demimonde?

				most of us were &#039;boneheads&#039; at some point, get yourself a phat coffee &amp; a notepad and spend a week lurking in the forums learning the ropes before you make your first order. your just having a few pre-revolution nerves.<br /><br />suck it up, learn and progress :D

				There are still some people on here now who haven&#039;t made their own orders yet, just enjoying the community and learning by immersion (probably enjoying friends who do make orders =P).<br /><br />If you made it here, and you want to learn, you can do it. Just commit.<br /><br />~squid~

				^^ yeah agree with both the above. use the search box in the top right of this forum for stuff like &#039;PGP&#039;, &#039;bitcoin&#039; and whatever else you need to know. then read, read and read some more. most of the real important stuff is stickied in the security section. if you have searched for something but can&#039;t find what you need to know, don&#039;t be afraid to ask.<br /><br />the first order is always the worst. until it turns up anyway, then it feels like christmas :)

				spend a few hours on the security forum, theres vastly differing prefered methods to use, ranging from Uber-paranoid to the totally flippant.<br /><br />thinking logically, decide which steps are the most important in protecting yourself but also which steps are worth taking in sheer terms of work. some things just aint worth the hassle!<br /><br />

				i started here many moons ago knowing nothing about encryption, bitcoin, etc. but have made many successful small buys since i was a bonehead n00b.<br /><br />you can do it, just read and read and read and read and read the forums until you&#039;ve got it all squared away.&nbsp; take your time, don&#039;t talk to all your mates about what you&#039;re doing (don&#039;t u know bad boyz move in silence and violence? take it from ur highness), get a mailbox somewhere safe, and soon you will be ready to fly :)<br /><br />if you got the will you can find the way

				It&#039;s pretty simple. I would search the security forum to decide whether you want to use your real name, a fake name, your friends real name, your address, your friends address, a po box, etc... <br /><br />You should also decide on how you&#039;re going to get your coins. <br /><br />The gist of it is as follows:<br /><br />Set up GPG (or your equivalent) and figure out how to decrypt, encrypt and sign messages.<br /><br />Buy coins.<br /><br />Transfer coins to SR directly, or tumble them first, or bitfog them first.<br /><br />Make your purchase.<br /><br />Get nervous while you wait for your package.<br /><br />Enjoy.

				^^^^^^&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as a pointer to this first line. Always use a real address, don&#039;t bother with fakes or fake names. A random brown package with a real name going into your mailbox with arise much less suspicion than some oddball name the mail person isn&#039;t used to.<br /><br />-Cheers

				Welcome-<br /><br />Much good advice has been given so far - I also suggest that you look for reviews for the product you are interested in, then find a seller that has good ratings and solid reviews in the forums.&nbsp; After that, look up their vendor profile on the marketplace, read it thoroughly and send them a message.&nbsp; Keep it short, but be honest and real.&nbsp; Let them know you are considering them for your first SR purchase because you have read good things about them.&nbsp; Talk to them a bit, and that can ease your worries.<br /><br />This is about how I made my first purchase.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been scammed, and I don&#039;t intend to be.&nbsp; Follow where people have gone before you - learn from their mistakes. <br /><br />You&#039;re already starting off well - I think most people who get scammed do so because they don&#039;t use the forums.&nbsp; This is a powerful tool that can help you to make good decisions.&nbsp; Best of luck traveling the road!

				Can only agree with what most others have said , read up some of the amazingly helpful threads on here. When I joined I was like a kid in a candy shop and never even went near the forums and just headed straight for the weed ! Things were ok and stuff but my first couple of purchases were made without using PGP etc then I started to learn about that eventually but thinking back I&#039;d rather have taken a week to learn the ropes and etiquette of this fine site ...<br /><br />I just can&#039;t say no to drugs though ! <br /><br />Welcome to the road btw .... Your life won&#039;t ever be the same again !!!

				It took me AWHILE before I made my first purchase... but when I did was it awesome!<br />My buddy made purchases because he&#039;s been here for 6months or so.. so people tend to fuck with him way easier than they would I.<br /><br /><br />Soo.. anyways. Keep your forum open and always ask questions! Fuck the vendors who don&#039;t want to answer them.. they&#039;re probably the ones who will tell you NOT to PGP your address.

				Welcome to SR, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be able to &#039;pull this off&#039;, I have &amp; I knew very little about PGP, bitcoin, TOR &amp; SR procedures &amp; etiquette before getting here.<br /><br />Just take a little time, set up PGP (see the link in my sig), setup &amp; fund bitcoin, get some idea of the security tips offered here, decide how you&#039;re going to make an order &amp; who with. Again check the vendor reviews in the Rumour mill.<br /><br />Enjoy SR, it offers a huge range of choices.

Install Tor by going to https://www.torproject.org/&nbsp; Just click &quot;Download&quot; and follow the instructions. (Oh, well, you&#039;ve already done this because you&#039;re using the forum :)<br /><br />2. Go to Silk Road http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/ and login. (Or create an account if you don&#039;t already have one.)<br />3. Click on &quot;account&quot; and select and copy the bitcoin address where it says &quot;to deposit bitcoins, send them to this address.&quot; (Below you will buy and send bitcoins to this address in order to deposit them into your Silk Road account.)<br /><br />4. Go to BitInstant.com, and follow these steps:<br />a. Under &quot;Pay from&quot; select your preferred location under &quot;Cash Deposit.&quot;<br />b. Under &quot;Pay to&quot; select &quot;Bitcoin address&quot; and in the section below where it says &quot;Bitcoin address&quot; paste the bitcoin address from step 3 above.<br />c. Under &quot;Amount to send (USD)&quot; enter the amount of dollars you are going to deposit.<br />d. Under &quot;Notification email&quot; enter an anonymous email address, such as a tormail address. Don&#039;t use your regular email address. To create a tormail account, go here http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/signup.php<br />e. Click &quot;Send funds&quot; and follow the instructions.<br /><br />5. Go to the location you selected from step 4a. and hand over the cash. (Fyi, no one knows that you are sending bitcoins to a Silk Road account, and this is not connected to your name or identity.)<br /><br />6. Wait about an hour for the bitcoins to be credited to your Silk Road account.<br />7. Now you&#039;re ready to buy :)<br /><br />Everyone, please feel free to make any additions or modifications to my tutorial above, or provide any additional details re buyer security.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />SpookDrFeelgood

				My biggest obstacle when I wanted to get in to this was getting the btc&#039;s, but once I had those it was pretty easy and straight forward.<br /><br />Of course I skipped lots of security measures at first but I will work on that as I go, I live in a country where the police can&#039;t really do jack shit anyway, just a shame they have decent customs.
