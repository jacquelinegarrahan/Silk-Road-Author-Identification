				So I was informed by a certain person from the European Union that Indian meds are cheap and not as potent as the meds manufactured in EU and elsewhere. But I&#039;m trying to establish a connection who sells Benzodiazepines for lower than market value on the street so I can make some cash on the side and I can have some for myself. The only ethnicity that has that capability is the Indians. I realize living in America I might have to wait for a month or so for my care package to arrive, but I refuse to pay over market value when I can run into a good deal every once and while on the streets. I would rather go without and not fuck with any of these greedy vendors that charge ridiculous amounts of money for, yet again, generics. I&#039;m sorry to seem pompous and say that every benzo not manufactured by the ORIGINAL COMPANY IN THE US is generic. But why would India have a weaker chemical structure. Thoughts and ideas would be appreciated.<br /><br />P.S. The U.S. is going to take the way of the Egyptians, Romans, and English in losing our world dominance as a superpower. And China will be the next superpower when they decide to finally cut off the adolescent U.S. as any good parent should and make themselves the next Superpower of the world
