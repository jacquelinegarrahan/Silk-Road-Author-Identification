				Hi, I was wondering what the general opinion is (and especially the opinion of the SR creators) of sellers requesting new buyers to finalize early, curtailing the escrow system.&nbsp; It seems to me that the creators of silk road want the escrow system to apply to everyone.&nbsp; Whereas some sellers see escrow as a privilege for buyers with established feedback. I understand the rationale behind it, new buyers are more likely to scam and refuse payment than established buyers with a good reputation.&nbsp; When buying from a reputable vendor I&#039;m not too worried about finalizing early if its requested.&nbsp; However, I recently made my third purchase and the seller asked me to finalize early, unfortunately the seller was new as well.&nbsp; Had it been a common product with many sellers I would have found a well established seller.&nbsp; However, this product was only being sold by one seller.&nbsp; Pleasure seeking and drug use often over rule logic and I decided to finalize early anyway.&nbsp; Although I trust the guy, I am a bit worried.&nbsp; How do you all feel about the idea that &quot;new sellers must finalize early/escrow is a privilege for established buyers only&quot;?&nbsp; What if the seller requesting you to finalize early is new himself?

				I wont, for anything.<br /><br />It depends on how willing you are to risk losing that money. It&#039;s your choice ultimately but if everybody stops agreeing to do it then the vendors will stop requiring it.

				Exactly as cache said. <br /><br />Consider that a seller who is well financed and is serious about being a vendor won&#039;t require you to finalize early. But do finalize on receipt and not after you have sampled the product days later. <br /><br />If a new seller requires people to finalize early, it could mean that it&#039;s a scam, or he doesn&#039;t have the product on hand and is using your money to go get it, or he worried about being scammed (listed in order of likelihood).

				Good point cache.&nbsp; Resistance through non compliance.&nbsp; Works for governments on a large scale, should work for SR too.

				Only problem is, there are far too many who finalize early. Even with trusted sellers. You even see it in the feedback as &quot;finalized early for a trusted vendor.&quot; They seem to do it out of respect. Though they don&#039;t realize that anything can happen to a trusted vendor at anytime. The best thing to do is to finalize on delivery. <br /><br />About once a week or so you see buyers regretting finalizing early.

				Buyers should not purchase &quot;out of escrow&quot; or &quot;finalize early&quot; under any circumstances. Agreeing to send cash upfront in the hope the seller will follow through is just asking for trouble.<br /><br />The powers that be here have tried vigorously to crack down on the first practice (out of escrow), because it&#039;s not only risky for buyers, but because it costs the site money (in lost commissions). They haven&#039;t yet cracked down hard on the second practice (finalizing early), even though it is just as risky for buyers, because they don&#039;t have any financial incentive to do so.<br /><br />

				Finalizing is your only real leverage against bad vendors.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve already finalized you have no cards left to play if the seller starts to fuck you around.&nbsp; What are you going to do, go find the jerk?&nbsp; Good luck, if it were that easy the police would have done it already.<br /><br />There is a certain top seller (within the top 10) that seems as if they could not care less about you after the order has been finalized.&nbsp; They don&#039;t even respond to messages, because why should they try to impress you?&nbsp; You&#039;ve already sealed the deal, you are useless to them now: just a burden on their time.&nbsp; To add insult to injury, they also insist upon running more finalize early sales than every scam vendor combined.<br /><br />The only thing that truly talks around here is money.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have a way to control the money (like being able to finalize an escrow order) you are going to be in somebody else&#039;s control.&nbsp; Feedback means nothing, especially since SR said &quot;go ahead, fuck over every small order it won&#039;t hurt your feedback.&quot;&nbsp; As long as a vendor does their large dollar orders correctly they can scam every single small order and have their feedback change negligibly.<br /><br />There needs to be a specific and independent rating for early finalization that awards no more than 3/5 until the order has actually been filled.&nbsp; Will this change anything since feedback has been rigged?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Will it at least create the precedent that a 5/5 early finalization feedback IS NOT EQUIVALENT to an EARNED 5/5 for an order filled successfully?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; It would also prevent terrible scammers from having an inflated ranking due only to 5/5 feedback from FE, even though they haven&#039;t delivered a single package yet.<br /><br />In reality, I&#039;m not so sure we should propose any change to this market.&nbsp; We all on some level are aware that this is the temporary market until it finally is shut down or ruined (more likely) slowly by asinine policies and cheap gimmicks.&nbsp; We should focus on how to construct a new marketplace that won&#039;t suffer the same pitfalls as SR.&nbsp; Having one person get rich off of the work of others and having one person with access to all of the critical and damning data (which we&#039;ve seen isn&#039;t deleted from the switch in the accidental DB error message shown) doesn&#039;t help to remove beliefs that maybe SR has been in the hands of LE from the jump.<br /><br />We all knew it was too good to be true, and it has proven itself to be.&nbsp; If you are lucky enough not to get scammed, you&#039;re still overpaying for product and being taxed by SR for the privilege of possibly being scammed.&nbsp; The same aspect of ourselves that made SR come to be will cause the death of SR: greed.

				I&#039;ve finalized early in my buying days and I went 50/50 for getting burned.&nbsp; Funny thing is I only made 2 purchases.&nbsp; After getting burned I decided to start a vendor account and make up for the POS vendors out there as much as I could which is basically impossible due to the scammers that pop up here and there.<br /><br />But I embrace new buyers at this point.&nbsp; There&#039;s no reason to finalize early for a vendor, if they can&#039;t afford the miniscule amount they&#039;re willing to send for a first purchase as a loss then they probably shouldn&#039;t be offering.&nbsp; Besides, the SR system should protect us from scammers for the most part.

				I finalized early my first few buys, but I chose vendors with solid reputation and never got &quot;scammed&quot;.&nbsp; Some required it, some didn&#039;t.<br /><br />Silk Road is a &quot;seller&#039;s market&quot; much more so than it is a &quot;buyer&#039;s market&quot;, and for that reason, I&#039;ll take the quality goods purchased here over the shit on the street every time.<br /><br />Start off small, not more than you can afford to lose, and build up your buyer stats.&nbsp; But the most important thing to consider is this: Solid vendors list their terms on their main page.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t agree with the terms, then don&#039;t order from them, simple as that.<br /><br />Credibility and reputation carry a lot of weight here.&nbsp; New vendors have to prove themselves to the community, but so should new buyers.&nbsp; The community polices itself, and new buyers and vendors alike go through a thorough vetting process in order to gain &quot;road cred&quot;.&nbsp; This market is as dynamic as the people who comprise it.<br /><br /><br />Choose your vendors wisely, communicate effectively with them, and you won&#039;t get fucked.&nbsp; The community is what makes this whole thing work.
