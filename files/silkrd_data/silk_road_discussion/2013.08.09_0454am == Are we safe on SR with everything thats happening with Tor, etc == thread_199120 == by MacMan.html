				Programatically, yes, personally, maybe not. If you are running the newest Tor browser, you are safe from the exploit (Firefox ESR 17.0.7). You should also disable scripts for protection just in case another exploit comes out. Make sure your no script plugin is enabled and you will be safe. Can&#039;t comment on who you&#039;ve ordered from though, if it&#039;s BG, you should probably make a new account.

				Thought I was ready to order (have them planned out and things), but money was/is the issue.<br />Glad I took the time as this shit was in progress. I also had the vulnerability installed through previous attempts to log on to Tormail.<br />I never used clearnet links through Tor if I could help it. I was also running peerblock but I&#039;ve no idea if PB helps cross-scripted links or whatever.<br /><br />VPN&gt;Tor&gt;SR&gt;PGP.<br /><br />I mean, you are trusting someone with some time in the pen when you order illegal substances, and a shitload of time wishing you were dead on probation most likely.<br /><br />You better pick a vendor you trust. But then, my motto is never trust anyone. Life is a risk, death is just part of life..

This resists the simple reading of information that can be used to identify you.<br /><br />Second, disable scripts and plugins in Tor Browser, and use physical or virtual isolation between Tor Browser and the Tor client. This will resist active attempts to identify you, such as exploits designed to grab your IP and MAC addresses.<br /><br />Third, separate your identify from SR in the bitcoin trail, either by purchasing coins anonymously or mixing them properly in a trusted mixer, or as a vendor, taking similar steps to cash out in a way that separates your vendor account from your identity.<br />
