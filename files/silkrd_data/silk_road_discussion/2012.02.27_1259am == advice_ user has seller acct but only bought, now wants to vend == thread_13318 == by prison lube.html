				I joined in the wayback when seller accounts were free. I got a seller account but never sold, only bought.<br /><br />Now Iâ€™ve got some shit people will pay money for. I want to vend it here.<br /><br />Obviously I need to shut down the delivery address(es) and stop behaving like a buyer on that account.<br /><br />But they were real addresses. My name or something close to it were on the packages I received.<br /><br />If a vendor kept one or more of my names &amp; addresses, it would be pretty dangerous for me to start vending. It could be an open door to LE. A vendor could blackmail me.<br /><br />Seems impossible to do safely. Any thoughts on how it might work?

				Just buy and sell from the same account, I do it. Stop being paranoid.

				Make a new account, message customer support from the new username and the old one, both telling support you want to switch status form one account to another. So long as you haven&#039;t sold anything they will let you.<br /><br />~DigitalAlch
