				We&#039;ve read it. We also understand seizure protocol. All that being said, the lore behind DPR (and Inigo and the rest of the crew) is a pillar on which the entirety of SR was established. When DPR falls - Inigo becomes DPR, third in command becomes Inigo, and so on.<br /><br />There shouldn&#039;t be any messages needed. This is disaster control. Mandatory protocol. If you&#039;ve been paying attention all this time, we&#039;ve already seen at least 3 DPRs. Where is the chosen one!? Perhaps waiting for things to cool down.<br />.Aidoneus Team.

				They have apparently been watching &#039;DPR&#039; since the start. In other words, they probably have every piece of correspondence sent between users/vendors as well as access to his backup servers and whatnot. Let&#039;s hope I&#039;m wrong though...

				I&#039;d say goodbye to everyone you know, and meet at either Sheep Marketplace or BMR, they both have forums.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure former SR vendors will start to vend there, at least i hope.<br /><br />I&#039;m already on both, but not under JneMonic.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be opening up shop there soon on both sites...only if a certain vendor i have just lost by some miracle joins BMR/Sheep, etc.<br /><br />Fingers crossed...

				Yup., this sucks boys and girls. <br />I just registered at Sheep, and that site is so cheesy it just does not inspire confidence . I was already a member at BMR, which seems a little better. I&#039;ve never used it though. Too bad Atlantis didn&#039;t stay around a little longer. I&#039;m just glad I hadn&#039;t funded my wallet yet, I was gonna today for a purchase I was making tonight. I don&#039;t know why Atlantis shut down, just due to slow business maybe? Now would be a good time for them to crank it back up.
