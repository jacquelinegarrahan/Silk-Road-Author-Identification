Because it looks to me like these addresses, one of which transferred 20 bitcoin out of my wallet before it ever showed up in my wallet, are consolidating about 400 bitcoins.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is bad fucking news.

				They can&#039;t transfer them before they arrive unless they have a time machine.<br />sure, instawallet could have been hacked, but they are NOT A BANK (says so right on their site) you should store your BTC on your local wallet until you are ready to use them, and then hop them to instawallet, then bitfog, then bitjack,then to instawallet, then back to your wallet, then to SR, then to the vendor...or something like that.

				I just sent a couple of transactions both to and from instawallet. one was large enough that if someone had compromised the site, they probably wouldn&#039;t have let that one make it to me home stored wallet, but here it is safe and sound. glitched don&#039;t always mean a site has been hacked. remember when deposits were being misdirected on SR after one of the updates a few months back? probably not, but it did and does happen, cotact their support and find out what is going on, but I wouldn&#039;t panic just yet.

				Actually my bitcoin did not end up in that same wallet, it appears as though it went into a different random one and stayed there. The way it happened though it is hard to think it is not a person/program doing this on purpose. But I really have no idea how to read these things and stuff so I am not sure. I am going to wait until tomorrow and email him as that is what the FAQ says. I just hope this can get resolved, though I really do not see how it can since everything is anonymous.

				All is good in the world today.<br /><br />It was simply a glitch that they were having, I e-mailed tech support and they fixed it.<br /><br />I am glad I did not freak out about this, though some may think I was.<br /><br />Instawallet it still awesome! I repeat, instawallet it still awesome!
