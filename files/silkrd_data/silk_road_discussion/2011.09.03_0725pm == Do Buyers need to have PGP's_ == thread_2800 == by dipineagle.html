				Everyone should be using GPG... Especially when giving up your personal info. That way, you are assured that the person you are buying from is the only one that can read it.. It&#039;s not a cure all, but its one more gun in our arsenal that will help protect you...

				All the steps involved in PGP sucks. They don&#039;t make it super easy. But it is worth all the time invested to learn. Safety is number 1. And PGP is a great step in the right direction. I&#039;ve used it on a regular basis for months and it still troubles me sometimes. Nature of the beast I guess. Hey, it&#039;s better on the outside than on the inside. The air is fresh and the food is better. Best part... no cellmates! Use PGP!!

				I admit I haven&#039;t used it as often as I should because its a pain, but this OVDB shit has me paranoid, so I guess I&#039;d say it should probably be used for everything.<br /><br />Edit: Rereading your OP, no, most people don&#039;t require it for ordering (unless you have additional questions)... still, the above, I maintain, is good advice.

				For short PM&#039;s that have no real information I don&#039;t bother.&nbsp; But I would never send my address in clear text.&nbsp; Encrypting it with the sellers key gives me some assurance that they are the only ones who will be able to read it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, by encrypting it both ways, you pretty much guarantee that &#039;you are you&#039; and the &#039;seller is in fact the seller&#039;, unless someone has been silly enough to give out their private key.<br />

				You can type pretty much whatever you want as far as questions about product or pricing or whatever without PGP.&nbsp; If a buyer absolutely wants me to respond with PGP I will but for the most part its meaningless except for where the identity of the person behind the username is being used.<br /><br />That&#039;s the key - even if the site servers got siezed and everything was fine-toothed by LE, as long as your actual IRL information is PGP&#039;d they have nothing.&nbsp; Just that some party in this country or that country wanted this, bought this, sold this, etc.<br /><br />I usually just respond with a sort of &quot;fluffy&quot; response if someone PGP&#039;s me a message - unless there are pertinent details then I ALWAYS PGP.&nbsp; Buyers you should NEVER put your shipping information outside of PGP.&nbsp; Other than that it&#039;s not a big deal as far as I&#039;m concerned, although your level of anal-retentiveness can be as high as you wish.&nbsp; Even though SR says all shipping information is destroyed once it&#039;s confirmed shipped, you never know (and there are hundreds of items &quot;awaiting shipping&quot; on a given day that LE would have full customer info on.<br /><br />Play safe when in doubt.&nbsp; At a minimum encrypt your shipping information, no exceptions.
