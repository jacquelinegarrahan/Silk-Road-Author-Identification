				In my humble opinion, SR is more addictive than the drugs I come here to buy. Like you, I am always on the look out for new drugs to try, new vendors etc. It consumes quite a bit of my time. I occasionally take a break also - it is good to chill out for a bit without feeling the necessity to check the value of the bitcoin etc.<br /><br />Enjoy your time out and we&#039;ll see you when you return :)

				Your right it is more addictive, I find myself just reading the same page over and over incase I missed anything, I will just chill knowing its there when I need it, I ended up with to much weed and hash, Ill get through this little lot then come back.<br /><br />

				When I dont come on forums or sr its the same feeling I get when I&#039;m craving a cigarette, like I&#039;m pissed off and cant settle.<br /><br />At the same time though I know after a day or two I will look back and not be as bothered then sort of forget about sr for a while.<br /><br />To much of a good thing and all that.

On the positive end, I (and I&#039;m sure most of the others here) tend to be more informed about using stuff. And I make sure it doesn&#039;t negatively affect my life (ie. reading about stuff when I should be working/studying) so it&#039;s not too bad. We all just are interested in something with a somewhat negative social stigma.

				Exactly, Silkroad itself is addicting more so than the products I buy from here.&nbsp; I find myself coming here a lot. In my opinion Silkroad is the best Drug community on the internet! There&#039;s a wealth of information here in the forums.&nbsp; I also enjoy checking up on every thing but I too need a break from here. Yet at the same time I&#039;m trying to score some LSD.

				Sometimes, I have to fight the urge to check the forums at inappropriate times, such as in a class, while driving, at work, at an important event, etc. Not even always log in to the forums, just read through anything that I do not remember reading. <br /><br />Has anyone developed something that can help ease forum withdrawal symptoms?

				copious amounts of weed so you really can&#039;t be bothered to sift through the amount of crap on here. or just go in the newbie section for a couple hours and do the thankless task of trying to help them, that&#039;ll probably make you happy to leave for a good while.

				Well, personally I feel &quot;at home&quot; here. On the forums, I find many people who see life the same exact way I do. Where I am from, people are very close minded and if you were to mention you smoked a J 3 weeks ago, that may end up getting you labeled a strung out&nbsp; tweeker. As it was stated before, the negativity of drugs portrayed by the media and these close minded people has an effect on us. It makes me feel very secluded within my own community. So.. when I get to come here and see how many people out there ARE like me and that I can actually converse with you all about our similar interests without being labeled or judged.... well it makes me happy. How many people STAY on Facebook 24/7? They get notified every 5 mins on a new post or pic.. In my eyes, THAT is an addiction. Don&#039;t feel bad because you found a place to fit in. Just try to keep your real life priorities in check.&nbsp; 8)
