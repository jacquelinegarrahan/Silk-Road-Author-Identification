				So,<br /><br />I have left with quite a bit of meph after making some orders to find some good meph vendors here,&nbsp; and to say the least i was not too impressed from all of them even tough they are fun,&nbsp; so i had a few days break from Thursday till today after some holiday we had here and i decided to use some more tonight before we are going back to normal life...&nbsp; even that my nose is a complete mess from this crap.<br /><br />just now i remembered that yesterday my father in law sent me about 500g of fresh and young Khat leafts that he grow (very cheap,common and the only way that cathinone usage&nbsp; is legal in my country - by chewing the fresh leafs)&nbsp; so i started like this:<br /><br />- about 10 lined from wertus meph, didnt get me too high<br />-&nbsp; 5 lines from IMB meph, starting to feel better<br />- filled a 200 - 300mg gelcap with IMB&#039;s meph and dropped<br />- did another like 10 lines<br /><br />all this was in a time frame of like an hour/hour and half at this point i was feeling pretty good :) <br /><br />And than i started chewing big chunks of leafs -&nbsp; to my surprise, after some time that is quicker that usualll (you need quite a bit of jaw exercise till you get the fresh Khat effects, luckily chewing is pretty easy while your high from meph anyway ) this completely&nbsp; took the edge from the &quot;toxic&quot; feeling of the meph high and made me feel very calm and not fiendish at all, probably cause the feeling from Khat is pretty similar - just WAY more weaker than Meph (when i say meph i mean all the synthetic cathinones cause god knows whats really being sold here as Meph)<br /><br />so i will keep chewing a lot and i hope that the natural cathinone will do something good to the synthetic one (Meph)... till now, seems like a recommended combination!&nbsp;

				So&nbsp; after dropping another two or three&nbsp; 200-300mg gelcaps i filled up with meph and doing who-knows-how-many lines&nbsp; + chewing loads of khat i can say this is a great combination to:<br /><br />-&nbsp; stop the &quot;fiending&quot; almost completley!<br />- remove the shitty effects (sweating bad feeling etc...)<br />-&nbsp; and even that im still intending to stay up - its pretty obvious that sleep would be VERY easy (i must note that i don&#039;t have a hard time going to sleep on meph normally as well)<br /><br />** And the most important Advantage:&nbsp; Wife is not mad at me for snorting today as she thinks im just high from the leafs!&nbsp; (chewing is a VERY socially acceptable thing here)<br /><br />on the other hand:<br />- the high is more &quot;mellow&quot; and calm,&nbsp; didnt make the high &quot;stronger&quot;,&nbsp; but its usually like that with meph after a couple of hours anyway and i have also built quite a but of tolerance in the past week or so, so who knows :)<br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp; just wanted to share if anyone is thinking about trying :)

				Lol , in your country i dont know... Here many people just grow it in thier gardens , its legal and not a big deal ;)<br /><br />Regarding which one is better? I wrote a review for both a few days ago in the meph vendors threads you can see there, in short im pretty sure that IMB&#039;s is better, anyway im just mixing both now togather before snorting<br /><br />but both not the best i have ever seen... Im still checking other vendors

				Thanks for the advice mate i dont think im able to take more than i did years ago :). And with these weak mephedrones being old around here i cant believe you can take too much,&nbsp; my nose gets blocked at some point &amp; redosing does nothing so im just getting bored and going to sleep, lets see how that goes :)
