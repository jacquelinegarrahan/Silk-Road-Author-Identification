				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I have just restocked my shop. Admittably, there are some strange things on it, but I am trying to fill a niche. One of the more common new arrivals is Lorazepam (Ativan), which is not that odd.<br />Sooo... the first one to tell me a joke (might be a bad one, and i will probably still laugh), will get the free gift code. women may jump the queue by flashing me!<br /><br />cheers!

				The other day I was walking through the park and I noticed an old man sitting on the park bench with tears in his eyes.&nbsp; I sit down to see if there was anything I could do to help.<br /><br />&quot;Sir, are you ok?&quot; I asked.<br /><br />&quot;Well not really.&quot; the old man continued, &quot;you see I am married to this unbelievably beautiful 21 year old model.&nbsp; I mean really gorgeous, she quit her career as a Victoria&#039;s Secret model to marry me and travel the world.&nbsp; Every morning when I wake up she gives me a blow job and then cooks me breakfast.&quot;<br /><br />The old man stops to sniffle and pulls a handkerchief from his breast pocket to wipe his eyes.<br /><br />&quot;Well that sounds amazing!&quot; I add.<br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s not the half of it young man.&nbsp; After breakfast I watch her do yoga naked for about 30 minutes until I drift to sleep in my chair.&nbsp; She wakes me up for lunch and right after that we make beautiful love. She is also a wonderful chef and always makes us a gourmet dinner.&nbsp; The food is amazing and I really think she is a gift from God.&quot; the man says with more tears forming in his eyes.&nbsp; &quot;Every night we make love in the bath as she washes me and then she falls asleep in my arms.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well sir it seems like your wife is really wonderful.&nbsp; If everything is so amazing with her why are you sitting here alone in the park crying?&quot; I ask.<br /><br />At this point the old man has really lost himself to the point that he is crying uncontrollably. Finally after about two minutes of crying he is able to respond.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t remember where I live!!&quot; the old man exclaims.

				Complaining co-worker: Jesus! My head hurts.<br />Not so sympathetic co-worker: If I had a head like that and it didn&#039;t hurt, I would go see a doctor.<br /><br />This is merely a quote from a song, but funny. &quot;Tell your kids to say no to drugs, that means more for me!&quot;<br /><br />Have a good day and hope you got a chuckle at least. ;)

				Everyone here is terrified of scams and too good to be true <br /><br />You almost need a representative to sell for you. Haha. A spokesman that everyone here will trust. <br />I hope this helps you.&nbsp;
