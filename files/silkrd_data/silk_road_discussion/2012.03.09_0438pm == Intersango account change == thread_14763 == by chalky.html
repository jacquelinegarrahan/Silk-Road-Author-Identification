				Ive noticed today that Intersango have now changed their bank to Metro Bank....fine if you live in London to make a cash deposit as that&#039;s where the branches are, but not so good if you don&#039;t!<br /><br />Anyone got any idea&#039;s where else you can get BTC&#039;s from in the UK, anonymously? - For obv reasons I don&#039;t want to transfer Â£ to Metro from my own account....<br /><br />Damn, and it was so easy before!

				That&#039;s a shame, Intersango were pretty fast.<br /><br />Mt Gox have a Barclays account that you can pay cash into though, looks like I&#039;ll be using them again from now on!

				I spoke to them yesterday and they had an issue with their Metro account where they&#039;ve been locked out for some reason. Thinking maybe somebody tried to hack their account?<br /><br />I think all deposits are going to be delayed.<br /><br />To OP, for what obvious reason can&#039;t you transfer to the Metro account? You can still transfer money to it via wire just like the old Lloyds account.

				So say I made a deposit to Intersango late last night to their Lloyds account without having adequately read their support page...<br /><br />Do I want to get on the phone to my bank to cancel that?<br /><br />Edit: never mind, transaction made it through to my Intersango account this morning.

				We still have it pretty good<br /><br />A good aussie buddy of mine now has to physically go into certain banks to deposit money then go through a long annoying process <br /><br />Intersango, by comparison is much better, the guys themselves if I&#039;m rightly so have one of the original bitcoin founders amongst them (am I wrong? I&#039;m sure I read something like that) and only recently they started charging for the service, and its still very tiny.

				Intersango is always having problems with withdrawals taking days and days, just endless excuses from the admin and lies/bullshit/excuses on IRC when you ask about it. Fuck that site.

				@AAkoven<br /><br />I&#039;m not a big fan of Intersango either, not because of these transactional troubles (albeit they might be related, not to start the rumor-bird, but Metro is new and probably has newer CCTV tech... be wary as possible), but because the guys running it are anti-SR. They&#039;re incredibly hypocritical, SR represents the majority of value in the Bitcoin economy. No SR, and Bitcoin will fall like a stone. Why do you think the price keeps twitching when DPR says something. At this point, Roberts influences the economy more than the developers of Bitcoin. I believe SR is a giant asset to Bitcoin and all Intersango&#039;s legitimacy, and every other exchange, in terms of a being a viable quickly growing business, depends on it.<br /><br />All that said, your troubles with reaching Intersango probably have something to do with the fact you&#039;re probably living in the United States and they are living in the UK, hence they are asleep when you&#039;re trying to talk to them. I&#039;m not sure if anybody serves as customer service in the USA.

				I am in the UK and use Intersango every time and the one time a deposit was taking a while and I asked about it I got an almost instant reply. Never had a problem with them depositing to the Lloyds bank account, what&#039;s the problem with the Metro one?

				Admittedly when i used the lloyds account it was within 3 hours every time but it just annoys me they leave the option to deposit into the accounts that are fucked, i mean the metro has been fucked for a day or two maybe 3 now and they still have it up on their site for deposit...

				The Intersango still had the Lloyds bank but did change the main paying in account to Metro which is only based in London with 12 branches and one in Brighton.<br /><br />My experience with Intersango is ok. Had a 24 hr delay once but usually I can get my BTC here in a few hours after paying in.<br /><br />Its easy to get BTC from Intersango into an E-Wallet also.<br /><br />As stated one of the founders of the BTC works for them and I hope it makes a success.<br /><br />As for paying in to intersango I would not worry.<br /><br />But if you were trading you would not do that.<br /><br />How do other users in the UK get their BTC? Intersango has bidding and you can get the BTC for a little below the going price on MX Gov in the USA.<br /><br />Would people in the UK pay into an account for BTC? I mean transferring money from bank to bank is fairly fast. I guess we have traders here already who do this but could a 24-hr operation actually earn enough to justify I wonder? Sending cash by post is usually safe if you do it right also. I know some do this in the USA and use various methods of payment even top up credit cards which are cash and can pay your bills!<br /><br />Anyhow I liked Lloyds as it has branches all over and you can go in and write out a slip and pay whatever along with a ref number to identify you. Had my BTC a few hour later but I only buy entire site rips of porn and sit up all night cheese wotsits. Actually turned my dick orange. Never again I said.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Personally I have never had any problems with Intersango, I have only used the Lloyds option but I cannot see why Metro is such an issue for people. Just pay it in on line and make sure to put it through a few e-wallets etc before it goes to SR.

				Good idea cache. I paid last through my bank and am not worried there.<br /><br />You can also change the BTC address here also.<br /><br />UK banks would look for money laundering but the average buyer need not worry. If I was buying bulk I would visit Lloyds and pay it in that way. May have to wait 24 hr but best to plan your purchases here and bear in mind it takes time sometimes to convert cash into useful cash!<br /><br />I got no issues with Intersango though its a case of bidding for BTC there. I tend to go lower than the current price as sellers always are selling lower if you look.
