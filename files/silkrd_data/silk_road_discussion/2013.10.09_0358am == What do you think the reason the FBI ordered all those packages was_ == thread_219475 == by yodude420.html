				So why on earth would the feds have been ordering packages since 2011?&nbsp; Were they trying to get an idea where some vendors were located as well what their packages look like?&nbsp; I just dont see a whole lot of explination for it; i mean unless they were just looking to get fucked up

				Not too sure what their reasoning would have been. However now that I think about it I think they may have purchased from me.<br /><br />I had someone want a custom listing for a bunch of really odd stuff. He wanted marijuana seeds, testosterone vials, Lidocaine, and something else. Didn&#039;t think much of it at the time but now it strikes me as a little odd.

				i think the better question is where they get their cash from<br />the gov. is in debt by over 16 trillion <br />yet they still find cash to make over 100 drug buys online<br />and thats just what they told us who knows how much they really bought
