				Silk road is mentioned specifically .. but really anyone in Aus that uses Topix, SR, private forums, onion sites etc and orders items for delivery via MAIL is at risk.<br /><br />Its the postal system/customs thats on their ass and its always been that way there and likely always will be.

The man was charged with 10 offences relating to the importation, trafficking and possession of narcotics and prohibited weapons.<br /><br />AFP Manager Crime Operations Peter Sykora said although Silk Road is based overseas, Australian users are within the reach of the AFP’s powers.<br /><br />“Criminals are attempting to exploit the international mail system through online networks, but the recent arrest demonstrates that we are one step ahead of them.<br /><br />“The AFP will continue to identify, investigate and prosecute individuals or groups importing narcotics into Australia, including via illicit e-commerce platforms such as Silk Road,” Commander Sykora said.<br /><br />Acting National Manager Cargo and Maritime Targeting Branch, Alana Sullivan, said that Customs and Border Protection monitors illicit e-commerce platforms including Silk Road and is aware of the Australian presence in the Silk Road market place, as both sellers and buyers.&nbsp; <br /><br />“Customs and Border Protection along with our partner agencies are committed to targeting and combating this type of illegal activity.<br /><br />“Persons who buy or sell through online market places, on so-called ‘anonymous’ networks should understand that they are not guaranteed anonymity,” Ms Sullivan said.<br /><br />While it is not an offence to access the website, it is an offence to import or attempt to import a border controlled drug or prohibited weapons into Australia from this website.<br /><br />Individuals who import border controlled drugs face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a $825,000 fine.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Media enquiries:<br /><br />AFP National Media (02) 6131 6333<br />Customs and Border Protection (02) 6275 6793<br /><br />Unless expressly stated otherwise, the findings, interpretations and conclusions expressed in this media release item do not necessarily represent the views of 36th Parallel Assessments.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				This is purely speculation but I will tell you what happened... the guy/kid has been ordering off the Road and oz customs caught one and when they confronted him he couldn&#039;t hold his mud and told on himself which is where the multiple charges came from... he probably gave up his account...<br /><br />&nbsp;Silk Road HAS NOT been compromised.

				Agreed Trustus.<br /><br />They simply know where alot of the mail they are intercepting in coming from and throw out the name Silk Road because its a hot topic at the moment.<br /><br />This SITE cant really be compromised but vendors on it can be if they reuse the same packaging methods for all their products, same return addresses etc<br /><br />Over time Customs will randomly search packs/packets and find contraband and blacklist those identifying aspects of certain shippers.

I can&#039;t wait until we vote for death sentences for all who ever enforced drug laws. The thought of their mass executions is extremely pleasant , I hope it comes soon.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Whoa, little harsh for me at the end there, but I do agree that these people are total jackasses.

I guess I get it with the indoctrinated rednecks and shit, and they&#039;re just sad, but I&#039;m hoping eventually education and reason will overcome.&nbsp; Hoping....

				For any LE to think that they&#039;re winning a war on drugs and ahead of the game... just shake your head.&nbsp; Yeah one arrest means nothing, if you went out on the streets you could find dozens for every online sale.&nbsp; This is also another reason I don&#039;t want to buy internationally, one less potential charge to go wrong + waiting twice as long sucks :P&nbsp; Victimless crimes should be the bottom of LE prioritization

All they can do about it is either:<br /><br />- Send you a love letter<br />- Scare a confession out of someone they suspect using SR<br />- Catch you in a C.D<br />- Catch you posting the goods if you&#039;re a vendor<br /><br />So fuck &#039;em.

				Someone I drink with his son emigrated and he works in customs. We met him and he was open about the work and at one point he worked with the postal workers who first inspect the mail as it comes through to customs also at the airport as the planes drop off hundreds of bags of mail and parcels. There are tons of air mail coming in each day and neither the mail workers or customs can seize every item coming through. Mail for instance, letter sized, ordinary business envelope, no way can they x-ray every envelope. But if they did we&#039;d not be seeing any mail get through. But they would need like 100,000 more inspectors.<br /><br />The real threat, though its not going to rolled out for a while, would be software that does what the human eye does, only much better and it never tires. There are prototypes and the security industry pushes the paranoia over drugs and terror. The USA would be first to deploy it. The cost would be billions but the USA spends billions bombing other nations that are not a threat to the West period. They are now. Billions means nothing to whoever is up there. We pay it in taxes, they spend it on projects that they and their mates profit off.<br /><br />Biggest threat to the USA is obesity. Kills more Americans than the terrorists can dream of.<br /><br />Back to those automatic xraying of every last letter, the process would be as fast it is now with people sorting the shit out. <br /><br />NOW, the scary thing would that the x-ray software might as well have writing recognition and translation. So &#039;dodgy&#039; letters from addresses in databases would be tagged. Dodgy people, addresses, anyone who ever got arrested and anyone who is not meant to be there or those who know some suspected of whatever.<br /><br />Silk Roads biggest weakness, as I have stated, is that some vendors use a signature packaging. Commenting on &#039;wonderful genius ways of sending shit&#039; is a joke. EVERY method used here is well known. Any customs officer with the ability to sense a lie would laugh at methods used here. <br /><br />Some vendors might say &#039;nothing has been seized&#039; but the truth is customs, the police and a myriad of agencies are onto this online world of trading. Vendors using the same postal method ought to keep changing. How easy is to replicate any business letter? <br /><br />Anyhow my theory is that there will come a time that mail in the West is scrutinized by auto x-ray with software hooked up to all kinds of shit. <br /><br />And lets face it. Any letter with a gram of h, coke, weed, hash, ket, MDMA or mushrooms is easy to spot IF the officer is awake and on the ball and looking at the x-ray machine..<br /><br />The weak link is customs buying a sample to get the actual style and look of delivery. Some are EASY to spot once they are tagged. Customs do have photocopies of various letters/parcels they are intercepting. The UK customs could easily fund an op to buy off here. Political pressure may bring this to bear fruit. <br /><br />And yes - sounds like a kid or someone not on the ball folded under the pressure. IF you ever got a small package of a gram intercepted its a love letter. Higher amounts its smash the door in time. <br /><br />Worse case, you bought a bit and were sitting with 100 grams of whatever in the cereal box. Your caught but can dig yourself deeper talking. NEVER give up the vendor account pass. Memorise that. Change it now IF you ever written it down on a pc or usb you have not wiped clean. Memorise that pass and pin. You got NO link to SR whatsoever because you also made a linux usb stick or bought one, right?<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				Everytime I read a &quot;bust&quot; post here on the forums everyone seems to get really defensive. Then the inevitable posts about how dumb the user was, followed by more self congratulatory remarks about how many steps ahead SR users are compared to the fuzz. <br /><br />The fact is, it can, and very may well happen to any of you. For every story we read about in the media, I bet you there are dozen more where SR users simply go off the radar quietly. <br /><br />It&#039;s all good and well to poke fun, but bust stories are an important reminder not to lose your own complacency and that in many ways the &quot;game&quot; is a bit of a gamble. Sure, you may well be safe enough doing all the right things and getting personal amounts. That doesn&#039;t mean an intercepted package won&#039;t lead to a policeman on your front doorstep and a severe disruption to your life even without conviction. <br /><br />Anyway, as you were :)

There are prototypes and the security industry pushes the paranoia over drugs and terror. The USA would be first to deploy it. The cost would be billions but the USA spends billions bombing other nations that are not a threat to the West period. They are now. Billions means nothing to whoever is up there. We pay it in taxes, they spend it on projects that they and their mates profit off.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It sounds right at first, but if you search my posts you&#039;ll see that it cannot actually be true for several reasons beyond the sheer scale of analyzing every package. Even with ion spec machines giving you drug sensing equipment accurate to a nanogram, it&#039;s still completely hopeless. LE will never obtain a magical machine that allows them to figure out precisely what is in every package in the necessary way for them to succeed. The false positive rate will always be too high because any drug sensing equipment sensitive enough to find a HDPP triple vaccum packed package will also be sensitive enough to obtain so many false positives it&#039;d be unreal. Your postman smokes a joint or accepts a letter from somebody who did, and suddenly the entire post office has to lockdown to discover the package to prevent it spreading particulate to the sorting office. Like I kept saying, the majority of cash has detectable amounts of cocaine and other drugs on it, and cash in the mail is hardly uncommon. And even if that wasn&#039;t true, we could just salt the post boxes of the world with fine particulate that would trip the sensors again and again, so unless LE expect every sorting center to convert themselves into cleanrooms for the sole purpose detection of drugs...<br /><br />And the post offices in most places are pretty much bust. If you make P&amp;P due to all this expensive machinery, then citizens will start setting up their own post offices, not to mention if the post office slows down the entire economy will grind to a halt.<br /><br />Even if the machines put up with it, the people won&#039;t. One way or the other.<br /><br />My original post on the subject: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=16544.msg206494#msg206494

There&#039;s no possible way to mechanise detection on that scale without the redundancy of the system collapsing.<br /><br />Although, I thought the poster was talking more about optical detection, ie using some sort of high-speed package profiling equipment. Capturing address details of incomming parcels and storing on some kind of database for the purposes of running some kind of statistical analysis bot or as a reference later for detectives when condicting an investigation. <br /><br />Regardless, from what you&#039;ve said it sounds like even using something like optical sensing which is orders of magnitude more efficient than sensing nanograms of illegal compounds would cause the mail system to grind to a halt.<br /><br />Fuck hypotheticals are fun.

We did an extensive survey of packages from vendors and buyers points of view across many countries. The link is in my sig, as well as other good stuff.<br /><br />The majority of the rest are either lost, received but claimed as missing by fraudulent buyers, are delayed due to mislabeling by the seller or bad address data given by the buyer (happens a lot here) and so on.<br /><br />It&#039;s an educated guess to state the the actual rate of interception of SR packages is probably between a half and a tenth of 1 percentage or less. <br /><br />Even in those cases, a whole lot of packages from one or two vendors account for the majority of seized packages, because either the vendor is a complete dumb-ass at packaging and doesn&#039;t take it seriously, or else LE already had the vendor under surveillance because of RL related operations.<br /><br />If a vendor trades exclusively on SR and other darknet hidden services, takes the reverse package profiling techniques seriously, is up to date on subjects like particulate penetration rates through HDPP plastic, has a respectable vaccum packing device + experience, then I would estimate the capture/interception rates at between 1 in 1000 - 1 in 10,000. And if you regularly alternate style like some vendors do, then that&#039;s irrelevant.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a buyer, and you choose a respected vendor with good feedback, positive comments made on packaging, try to obtain your product domestically, then the odds of interception from your point of view are miniscule. About the same as receiving any package from Ebay or Amazon basically. <br /><br />We often get a skewed point of view on the forums, because negative occurrences like a missing package or a love letter are always going to be brought up, but people don&#039;t mention every time a package arrived without fanfare.<br />

				Yea typical shit like always, this was prob one guy ordering more than personal use amount that got a large package or 2 caught in customs and fucking ran his mouth about SR, just gotta look at the life imprisonment and/or a $825,000 fine or whatever and see what they are trying to do. That&#039;s just attempting to look scary and try keep people away, honestly you would need to be holding LOTS of drugs to get anything near that, and i have my doubts over the whole thing,<br /><br />So basically this is just scare tactics but we already knew that, always risk with international nothing changed use domestic and avoid customs bullshit or take that risk just make sure you are 100% anonymous in funding and sending personal details, don&#039;t import large amount and keep your mouth shut if they come knocking.

There&#039;s an ocean of legal drugs flowing through the postal system, not necessarily legal in the sense of not being scheduled, but illegal in the sense of not being prescribed or else prohibited by the Customs + Doctors Assocs + WesternPharma holy trinity legal Cartel in practice even if not in law. In particular, a huge amount, hundreds of millions, of Westerners are figuring out they can get the equivalent generic meds from abroad at a tiny fraction of the price in the West, sometimes saving them up to 30-40% of their income if they are an OAP.<br /><br />There are criminal activities going on in the postal system, and it sure ain&#039;t us! We&#039;re providing a service however you look at it! Regular civilians are getting raped up the ass on a daily basis here by these 21st century highway men.<br /><br />The majority of illicit product seized, was probably either initially thought to be what this legal Cartel thought was &quot;counterfeit&quot; (protip: counterfeit doesn&#039;t mean medication that doesn&#039;t do what it&#039;s supposed to, 99% of the time it really means medication that wasn&#039;t &#039;allowable&#039; by this Cartel in the West, where every med that isn&#039;t brand name or whose manufacturer isn&#039;t providing kickbacks is &#039;counterfeit&#039;), or else from prior intel like CharasBros said.<br /><br />This is another reason to stick to Standard Mail, the faster your delivery, the more customs paperwork filled out, the more likely you&#039;re to get a package intercepted by these clowns thinking it&#039;s non taxed tobacco, generics from India/China or steroids. This is backed up by the interviews we had with JanetReno and other people working with the post office system, they burn uncountable tons of all kinds of drugs in big furnaces periodically, most of which are legit. Incredible degree of resource destruction is going on.<br /><br />Another tip: the best way to minimize possible prior intelligence gathering for personal use buyers, apart from all the other precautions about using respectable vendors yaddayadda, is to do one 1 package at a time to your address, wait until it arrives before reordering. This sucks for people from Australia or New Zealand due to the long delivery times, but that&#039;s a problem that will gradually alleviate itself over time (I see postal drones in the future... :)). Everybody else should really be doing that though, it&#039;s sensible, boring and very annoying, but probably for the best.
