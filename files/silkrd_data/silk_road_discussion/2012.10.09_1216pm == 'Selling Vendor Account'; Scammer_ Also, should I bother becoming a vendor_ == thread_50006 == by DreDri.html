				One question I can&#039;t find an answer to, one question is unique to my situation:<br /><br />FIRST<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Is it possible (and safe/&#039;legal&#039;) to &lt;i&gt;buy&lt;/i&gt; a vendor&#039;s account?&lt;/b&gt; Is this frowned upon?<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen some listings all over the interwebz with people who are done selling and are willing to sell their accounts. Is there a chance they could claim they were hacked/forgot password and reclaim the account, thus fucking me out of my fee?<br /><br />SECOND<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;I plan to sell a few pharmaceuticals in small-bulk quantities along with various street drugs when I come across a good deal. Should I become a vendor on silkroad&lt;/b&gt; or stick to selling locally like I&#039;ve done so far?<br /><br />Thanks frenzzz<br /><br />

				In regards to your second question, you&#039;ll need to do some research first. Remember that there&#039;s a commission SR takes on each sale, that there are some small fees when dealing with bitcoin, that there is potential for fluctuation in bitcoin&#039;s price, and there are shipping costs: letters/packages, stamps, gas to drive to drop boxes, etc. Also remember that you must pay several bitcoins up front for the account, and must stay in escrow for your first several transactions, leaving a lot of money floating. If you look at products already on SR and think you can list your product at those prices, then you can consider it.<br /><br />It&#039;s a lot of work, more work than dealing face to face. Packaging with gloves/hairnet, printing addresses, going to multiple drop boxes, figuring out a safe way to cash out, in addition to the work you normally do in obtaining it... You&#039;ll also need to weigh everything out, if you don&#039;t already. You may get away with eying it when dealing face to face, but a lot of people on here weigh out their purchases and will leave you a nasty review if they&#039;re shorted.<br /><br />Scour the forums for the various vending guides before you commit. <br />

				If you cant even answer these questions yourself, im not sure you are ready.&nbsp; &nbsp;Selling on SR is completely different from face to face. SR only wants quality, speed, and good pricing.&nbsp; If you can do well in that, go for it. <br />Dont bother buying an account from someone else??&nbsp; thats stupid, become a vendor yourself. Start from scratch like everyone else. Make a name for yourself.

				Definitely start from scratch.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you can&#039;t afford SR&#039;s price for a vendor account then you probably shouldn&#039;t be selling.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are trying to take a shortcut this early in the game (or at ANY point), then you shouldn&#039;t be selling.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you can afford the account, can afford to let the start up money float&nbsp; for a while, are willing to spend a chunk of time learning the system, are going to be meticulous with your sales, commit 100% to your customer&#039;s satisfaction then the community will rally around and support you.&nbsp;
