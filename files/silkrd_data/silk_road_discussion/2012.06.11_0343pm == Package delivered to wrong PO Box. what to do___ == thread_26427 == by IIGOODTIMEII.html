				ok so i ordered HP of weed from MrYellow. It was sent in two packages at different times. i got the first one which was less then 50g then waited for the second one. I have a DCN by the way. it showed delivered on the 9th. but still nothing even today. talked to the guy who put the mail in the p.o. box&#039;s and he remembers the package said it was to big so he used the big box and dropped off the key in my po box. but he put the key in the wrong box because i got no key. they don&#039;t see the key in the other boxes. so someone must of got the key and once you open the box the key locks in place. so i hope that they will just return it. if not 2 things will happen. 1 they open it and steal it all 185g of it or 2 they open it and turn it in to the cops. but then they are breaking the law. <br /><br />what do you guys think? ever happen to you? i hope the person seen that it was the wrong name and box number but close to his and turned it in. what would you do any advise please...

				I think the best you can hope for is that they return it to you or the guy who puts the mail in the p.o box&#039;s, I&#039;m afraid. They might have taken it home and forgot about it until they see your name on it.
