				Just not as good. Give it a go if you like, I&#039;m just saying it&#039;s not for me. There is less choice at BMR, I don&#039;t like their policy on allowing listings that could hurt other people (I don&#039;t know if that has changed, I haven&#039;t been there for a while), the one man drug sites I feel are too risky for scams and above all I like Silk Road. I got to know which vendors I like here and I enjoy these forums. It&#039;s up to you. :)

				there are other good markets out there. most don&#039;t have the selection of SR or escrow. they are more built on trust (sometimes that trust fails) but they are also more focus on community, brotherhood, sticking together (IMO) If you are just buying headstash, you probably don&#039;t need to look much further than SR, because, well it&#039;s a good place to get started. There have been, and will always be splinter cells that break apart from the main herd and start something a bit more personal, and that is great. I had an overall point I was getting to, but it was fleeting and has escaped my grasp.<br /><br />

				Most other sites don&#039;t have escrow.&nbsp; some don&#039;t even use bc but use paypal.&nbsp; very scary indeed.

				This thread seems to pop up almost once a week.<br /><br />BMR is garbage. Not much more then scammers on there. <br /><br />I decided I was not going to go back after some dood was selling his 16 year old sister for BJs.<br /><br />I left. no thanks.<br />

				BMR&#039;s page setup gave me a headache.&nbsp; Scams happen here even with escrow, why risk it even more.<br /><br />There is a reason SR is well known and others aren&#039;t, because SR is honestly the best for now...assuming more of these types of darknet sites pop up.

				I wasn&#039;t saying that scams happen while the money is in escrow, I was saying it still happens in a place where escrow is used.&nbsp;
