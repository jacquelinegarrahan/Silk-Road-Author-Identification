				I have been intrigued by the concept of being able to get the most out of my bandwidth. We all wonder why certain people get better speeds when they have the exact same download package from their provider. I have just recently boosted my DL speed from 1.2 Mbps, to 1.8 Mbps with a very simple thing that you can overlook. Please update your network adapter drivers everyone, you will notice a massive speed boost in no time. This also helps wifi connectivity to anyone who is using a laptop with wifi. <br /><br />To find this information on windows, go to device manager it will be under network adapters. If you are on linux, you already know how to find it, i won&#039;t waste my time

It&#039;s extremely frustrating not getting the full speed you paid for, hopefully this helps you guys eek out that last bit of juice on your wifi. Also to anyone who uses wifi, if you have an older router, consider upgrading. The new standard is b/g/n i believe, not just b/g. Wireless N is the newer wifi standard, and delivers incredibly superior speeds, and is of course backwards compatible.

				Wanted to second this for linux users. I was using ndiswrapper for a Winfroze driver and when the mfr released the linux version I saw a HUGE increase in speed.

				If one is willing to learn about TCP, there are things one can do with TCP window sizing to help increase speeds and other things.&nbsp; You can also screw things up too so know your machine and your OS before you go messing around.&nbsp;
