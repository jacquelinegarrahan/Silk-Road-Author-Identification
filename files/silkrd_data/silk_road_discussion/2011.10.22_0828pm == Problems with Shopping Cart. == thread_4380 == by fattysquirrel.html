				huh, i had a problem a few weeks ago with the cart. i entered 3 in the quantity box and when i clicked the buy button it sent me to the updated shopping cart screen with only 1 in the quantity box. and no, i was not high :). it was no big deal, i just placed an order for two more of the item and messaged the vendor.

				You are not the only one who has noticed some issues with their shopping cart. I even placed an order, which worked fine, but the item still appeared in my shopping cart. I also had trouble adding an item to my cart. After logging out and restarting, everything has been working smoothly. Possibly because I had a more than one tab open or something... who knows? Good luck. <br /><br />- microRibonucleicacid

				I am also having some shopping cart issues.&nbsp; I tried to add items that weren&#039;t showing up.&nbsp; I eventually reloaded the site, and it was there, but when I tried to place the order, I clicked &quot;place order&quot; and the screen basically just refreshed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I waited a few minutes, but nothing happened (all BTC still in my account), so I placed the order a second time.&nbsp; It appears that its gone through after reloading the site again (BTC left account and order number is 1 higher), but hopefully there isn&#039;t a second transaction out there somewhere.&nbsp; All in all, seems like a minor glitch, and simply reloading the site (not just refresh, but close and re-open) is what sorted it out for me.

				I &#039;ve had a few problems, seems a bit like my keypad, or something, where if I&quot;m not real careful w/cart, the *amount* I want will change.&nbsp; I made an order for 3, and without me doing anything, it changed to &#039;1&#039; and that was the order that went thru, so I had to make another order, and put &#039;2&#039; in, plus send out encrypted addy twice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mostly it just made me pay attention...shopping cart isn&#039;t &#039;quite&#039; as simple as it looks, but I haven&#039;t had any other problems with it, and nothing has disappeared or anything like that...just means, again, I have to pay attention....
