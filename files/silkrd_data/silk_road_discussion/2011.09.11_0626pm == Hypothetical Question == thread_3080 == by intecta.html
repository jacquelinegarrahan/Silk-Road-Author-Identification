				As a new SR member and buyer, it&#039;s obvious there are a lot of good people here.&nbsp; My first buying experience was a very good one.&nbsp; Kudos to everyone who keeps it that way.<br /><br />My question is this:&nbsp; Suppose a seller becomes aware, through a comment in a private message for example, that a buyer has a problem with addiction.&nbsp; Do you as a seller feel obligated not to sell to that particular buyer?&nbsp; Or, since we&#039;re all adults here (hopefully), do you feel it&#039;s the buyer&#039;s problem and not your place to make judgements.<br /><br />It&#039;s like the bartender cutting someone off...although there&#039;s a liability component for the bar owner in that case.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is really a question for the sellers, but I&#039;d like to hear opinions from anyone.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for all the good information here and for SR in general.

Most casino&#039;s and gambling establishments are required by law to have self exclusion programs for problem gamblers.<br /><br />There could be a feature introduced in the future which enables a buyer to &quot;self exclude&quot; themselves for a period of 3 months or however long their rehab program lasts. However, in my opinion this would not stop any dedicated addict to just start a new buyers account or run down to their street corner.<br /><br />People with addictions will ALWAYS find a way to find their next fix.

				I know your dilemma, these candies are like hippy crack ;)<br /><br /><br />for the unfortunate few for whom this is not recreation it&#039;s a local problem and hopefully they can find support. if your product is safe (purity) your doing keeping them off the streets where they can be taken advantage of.

				Most of my products are used medicinally so I&#039;m not that worried. However that is a great question, if I was selling something of an addictive nature I would have to ask though as I think of it - it&#039;s a persons own personal choice their consumption habits. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I think it depends on each individual. Some dealers just see dollar signs while others see customers who are people... <br /><br />imho I could never help or contribute to throwing someones life away. I have seen drugs tear up enough lives, I would never want anybody to suffer for the sake of a drug. that is ridiculous!

Oh and i stick to pharms without the liver killing additives :) I agree though there are many legal substances that do just as much damage.
