				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I am expecting a package from vendor Roxy and have messaged the seller twice and they haven&#039;t even read, much less responded to my questions.&nbsp; Yet they log onto SR everyday, this whole situation has just left a bad taste in my mouth.&nbsp; Should I place another order and leave it in escrow and see what happens (for this one I finalized early since I was new-- i know, stupid and I won&#039;t do it again)?&nbsp; &nbsp;I know I&#039;m pretty much screwed but it just pisses me off that they aren&#039;t even reading my messages--beware!

				If you haven&#039;t finalized, wait until you have the option to take it to the resolution center for a refund. Otherwise, you can TRY and contact DPR but you might just be SOL

				Roxy is good people. Just be a little patient. Many vendors don&#039;t answer PMs unless there&#039;s a real problem. And you would title your PM accordingly if there were.<br /><br />Lots of new clients and SR first timers go through what you are going through. And in the end, they had nothing to worry about. <br /><br />

				Unfortunately I did finalize early (dumb, I know).&nbsp; What/who is DPR (sorry I&#039;m new here!), thanks :)<br /><br />And BenJesuit, thanks for the reassurance, patience is something I am lacking that&#039;s for sure! 8)

				DPR = Dread Pirate Roberts = creator of Silk Road = Lord of the realm = The main man. <br /><br />Generally speaking, when you finalize early with trusted vendors, you stand a lesser chance of getting taken. Part of the game here. Though, there have been incidents where a trusted vendor folded up shop, went AWOL and hasn&#039;t been heard from. Might have gotten pinched. Tricky business dealing in contraband. Anything can happen. <br /><br />Once you get some orders under your belt, finalize on receipt of product, not before. and if you have to go through resolutions, you might make or lose money. Why? BTC (bitcoin) fluctuations. <br /><br />Sit tight for a few days and things will work out. You&#039;ll be real excited when it comes. It&#039;ll be like magic of Christmas morning.

				Bro, I hate to say it, but didnt you already find the original thread talking about how roxy had scammed people???<br /><br />I am pretty confident roxy is a scammer. Especially since your messages are clearly being ignored. I am sorry to say this, but you need to accept your loss and learn from the experience. <br /><br />PLEASE do not place another with this vendor, even in escrow they may convince you to wait and accidentally auto-finalize or at the least you will just lose time you could have placed another legit order with. <br /><br />I think you should use the contact us link on SR to alert DPR that you were scammed and reference the thread in the forum so they are aware of the situation. you wont get your money back since you finalized early, sorry, but if enough people report being scammed then roxy will be banned <br /><br />BenJ I am just curious why you suggest Roxy can be trusted, have you had personal experience??? maybe I missed the reports, but I have not seen a single confirmation of the vendors reliability. I contacted the seller and they seemed extremely sketch so I decided not to order.

				Yea, I also finalized early with roxy 10 days ago. Nothing in the mail and I haven&#039;t heard from roxy since. Dumb noob move. His 100% feedback duped me, and in turn I was tricked to leave 5/5, which will probably help him scam more people. Bahhh.<br /><br />What is the cutoff time before someone should be reported? The buyers&#039; guide insists on a bit of patience... so 10 business days? 15? Since other people say roxy is legit I&#039;d like to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for a few more days.<br /><br /><br />

By the sounds of it, at this point you&#039;d be justified in altering your feedback. You can change it by visiting the accounts link followed by &quot;view feedback,&quot; then there should be an edit link next to the feedback in question. You can alter the score and the feedback text.<br /><br />As a vendor, I can add that sometimes responding to messages can be time consuming and you get a lot of the same questions over and over. But any decent vendor should be giving you a response. Aren&#039;t they the ones who should be trying to solicit business and maintain customer relationships? Seems insane to ignore them unless you&#039;re either really busy or are scamming (i.e. &quot;just don&#039;t give a fuck&quot;)<br /><br />Sorry your first SR purchase was non-satisfactory.<br /><br />Rocker

				Hello my SR lady friend :)&nbsp; since you made such a point about not being a dude... lol, sorry <br /><br />im glad to hear you didnt lose too much to the scumbag, still sucks the scammers always get some but it seems to happen to everyone at least once as a learning experience. <br /><br />did the feedback score ever change for roxy with the negative reviews? seems strange to me too and then they just got a positive review, maybe theyre going to put a bunch of fake feedback up again and try to scam some more people. at least the listings arent up since they havent signed in recently. <br /><br />did you ever message SR, what did they say?<br /><br />and i hate it when vendors have obviously read my messages but then just ignore then! maybe occasionally they forget or are busy which is certainly understandable, but in this case it is obvious what is going on unfortunately. <br /><br />Wish you better luck with your future orders <br />- miR<br /><br /><br />

				Yes, I have changed the feedback to a 1/5.&nbsp; I did message SR support and they said there was nothing they could do (even though I wasn&#039;t asking for a refund, as I made it clear in my message I knew I was not entitled to one since I finalized early) but thanked me for making them aware of the situation.&nbsp; <br /><br />I see that Roxy has not logged in for 9 days, although I can&#039;t imagine they got to have too much fun with the whole 60 bucks they stole from me 8)
