				DPR is gonna be a broke ass introvert when he realizes that somewhere along the way forgot about the revolution and started buying shit with the cash the community he neglects currently provides decides to move on to the next big thing.<br />We either have DPR 2,0 or an OG that forgot how fads work if they dont evolve fast enough. <br />If no one else will say it I will, we have a captain that ignores alarms and buzzers and needs to invest in his future by hiring some better professionals to help run the entire community, both the forum and the marketplace. The current staff seem to be held off at a distance and forced to deal with whatever DPR doesnt want or know how to fix.

				^ and who do you suggest he trust with the duties of policing this community, some anonymous person with a good standing with an anonymous community who is probably police? or maybe he should tell his close friends he runs a website for drugs and whether they would like to help out?<br />How often do Obama or David Cameron or The Pope make speeches to the people ?<br />Sure he could be faster or deal with shit better, but look at the alternative BMR ? or back to the street dealers that text you every time they got new shit or a new number ?<br />He&#039;s always behind the scenes doing his shit and he don&#039;t need to be telling us what that is.

				It&#039;s actually just an anonymous marketplace and WAKE UP last time the marketplace server went offline he didnt even know for 2 days.<br />Now there&#039;s this image hack still in the marketplace he cant seem to plug that hole and the vendor profiles have been compromised to clear the backup btc address, so they all need to be manually fixed by the vendors. The easy to solve/ignore spam issues on the all but forgotten forum.<br />He has no choice he&#039;s in over his head and needs help, he doesnt have to hand over complete control of the system just be honest with us and I&#039;m sure that areas of the websites can be delegated without losing everything. All he has to do is keep the btc tumbler safe. There is a million ppl at his front door that would do anything to help this place evolve beyond current issues.<br />There&#039;s members here that have been here almost 2 years that he could contact and trust enough to see if any could help with problems.<br />Off the top of my head there are a couple dozen vendors and from my research here I&#039;d say NOMAD has been as loyal as they come despite what I&#039;ve seen him have to deal with and from PM&#039;s with him, he seems to feel crazy at times for still volunteering here despite being ignored most the time and I cant blame him when I look at the State of the Road currently.<br /><br /><br />Sure it&#039;s easy to paint DPR as an idol but he didn&#039;t invent the anonymous market on tor and this version isn&#039;t gonna be the last one. DPR put it best when he said, &quot;The cat&#039;s out of the bag&quot; and as soon as another marketplace comes along with better management skills you&#039;ll see clearer. I&#039;m begging DPR to step up and be a leader but he wont do it and I refuse to pay him and he not treat the entire Silk Road experience as his only reason to breathe. The customers are not all happy delusional campers and as I&#039;ve seen many vendors lead the way if things dont change I&#039;ll be gone too and you can sit in your throne of denial.

It&#039;s not just an anonymous market place. It&#039;s a hidden service on the hidden web, littered with complexities. If things were as simple as you believe they are, I have no doubt there would be many more sites up and running with the owners world wide cashing in, compared to the few that are still operating. ??? Keeping SR out of the reach of LE for 2 years is in itself a great achievement IMO. Sure there have been some incidents but nothing major. These are either being plugged or have been plugged. Infiltration (the prevention of)&nbsp; will always be a priority for SR and they&#039;ve done a great job over all. Nothing in life is perfect and both LE and hackers will never give up trying to first find and then infiltrate the site. The forum is not a priority for DPR IMO as it doesn&#039;t make him any money compared to the SR site which does.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; He has no choice he&#039;s in over his head and needs help, he doesn&#039;t have to hand over complete control of the system just be honest with us and I&#039;m sure that areas of the websites can be delegated without losing everything.

Treat everyone on here as though they are LE!&nbsp; No exceptions. Not taking that approach could lead some to make mistakes and potentially jeopardize their anonymity. There is NO WAY anybody could trust anyone on an anonymous hidden web site, FULL STOP. That&#039;s not to say all the people here are bastards and I wouldn&#039;t interact with them. It&#039;s if you let your guard down and unbeknown to you, are communicating with LE, there will be an opportunity for them to strike, something you want to avoid. It wouldn&#039;t matter how long a person has been a member for, DPR will never attempt to employ an anonymous persona on the Hidden Web. I&#039;d be absolutely shocked if he did, but I&#039;m sure he won&#039;t. That is potential suicide on DPR&#039;s part and would be a really silly move. DPR is smarter than that and will always keep his cards close to his chest, just where they should be. He/she obviously knows what they are doing.

Adrien Chen mentioned it in his Gawker article in July, and 2 days later SR came out with a site redesign. So this isn&#039;t anything new. As the marketplace has gotten busier, DPR has gotten quieter on the forum, but he probably working feverishly behind the scenes.

				Here&#039;s the article I&#039;m talking about:<br /><br />http://gawker.com/5926440/are-authorities-closing-in-on-the-online-drug-market-silk-road<br /><br />Notice it&#039;s from 16 July 2012.<br /><br />Here are the relevant bits:<br /><br />Just over a year ago, we broke the story of Silk Road, the underground online market that&#039;s like an eBay for illegal drugs. It&#039;s been thriving ever since. But as the summer drags on, Silk Road users are becoming increasingly paranoid over a series of unexplained disappearances. <br /><br />...<br /><br />Feeding rumors that something&#039;s amiss has been the unusual silence in recent days of Silk Road&#039;s anonymous administrator, who goes by the handle Dread Pirate Roberts. <br /><br />...<br /><br />What troubles especially paranoid Silk Road is that DPR is usually a voluble presence on board. In honor of 4/20, he held a massive drug sale on Silk Road, which was advertised as including a giveaway with a grand prize of &quot;a trip for two with all the trimmings to paradise, all expenses included.&quot; But he&#039;s only posted on Silk Road forums three times since May 6th.<br /><br />&quot;Does anyone else find it strange that DPR&#039;s post count dropped significantly?&quot; asked a user today. &quot;I never payed much attention to it before until a friend mentioned that some major MDMA distributors from the NW USA heard about the operators of [Silk Road] getting caught. I brushed it off as a rumor until I looked through DPR&#039;s post count and now I&#039;m a bit concerned. I know this is pure speculation as I have no evidence or reliable source, It just seems like something worthy of discussing.&quot;<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />As you can see, there&#039;s nothing new here. :)<br /><br />

				OzFreelancer,<br /><br />So I went to your profile to check out your avatar and noticed the link to your web site. First, you&#039;re pretty bold for hanging out here under a real identity, though I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t do anything illegal. Second, you have an interesting blog.

If you see any listings with their pictures still affected, please report those listings immediately so we can take those pictures down, as I did with the listing mentioned in this thread.

				Thanks inigo for all that you do. The site doesn&#039;t run itself and would obviously require a lot of ongoing work to keep things as they currently are, safe and secure.

Everyone knows that he is always working on way&#039;s to improve the site. Also as to the nature of this thing..it is not like he can go out and get new help on coding and such. Also the forums has very little to do with SR. The main site is working perfect and has been for a while. If there is ever a real problem on there for you ...you can always contact support and you WILL get help. <br /><br />Can you guys even imagine how many questions DPR gets on here? And how many of them are dumb as shit and annoying as shit? Also people feel like they are entitled to know everything. lol. Just log on to SR, buy your drugs, wait a few days then finalize your order. It is that simple. If you so choose you can use services that are easily available so that you have ZERO risk with placing an order on SR. It has been proven that SR is in fact the safest way to get drugs in the world. And if people are smart enough to read for 5 min and choose the right vendor, they will have no problems at all. The problems happen because there are so many stupid fucks on here.
