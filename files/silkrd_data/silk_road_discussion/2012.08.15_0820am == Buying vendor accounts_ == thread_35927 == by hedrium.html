				A problem with your proposal is that a cop could make a vendor account to sell it to you. He would know who you are because Pay Pal isn&#039;t anonymous. Not only would you be at risk but also your customers. <br /><br />I think I saw some ads in the money section where you can buy bitcoins for cash in the mail. This might work better for you in the long run.

				Why would you even consider buying a vendor account using paypal? <br />If I was you I would do some research into how Internet vendors get busted before you start vending.

This rule is in place in order to protect the community from scammers who otherwise would be able to buy an account with excellent feedback, put a policy of early finalisation in place on their listings (which new vendors are prohibited from doing), and scam those willing to finalise because the account has excellent feedback. Buyers are recommended NEVER to finalise early as they immediately abandon the protection of the Silk Road escrow system, and thus Silk Road&#039;s resolution system should a problem arise.<br /><br />Even if you did manage to buy an account, if it WERE allowed, you shouldn&#039;t; you have A LOT more reading to do before you even consider doing business here and risking future customer&#039;s safety and anonymity.<br />Did you come here from The Farmer&#039;s Market by any chance? Those guys sure did love their PayPal, and now they&#039;re the most successful providers of goodies on the deepweb! Oh.. wait.. no.. They got busted. Because they were using Western Union and PayPal. Silly fellows.<br />Bitcoin, and Bitcoin alone, is used here for a reason; if it were safe and anonymous to use PayPal, we likely would do so. It&#039;s not, so we don&#039;t.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Yeah I have to agree with AmmoniaFumes, I am seeing a lot of people trying to become vendors lately that clearly have no structured plan on how exactly they intend to go about it. I mean yeah, laundering BTC properly is one thing but you need to be able to have some idea of how to do it on a basic level. <br /><br />New/Future-prospective vendors - If you are going to be a vendor here you can&#039;t just sign up and then expect the forum to school you, you need to take the initiative and learn the basics yourself. Don&#039;t be lazy.
