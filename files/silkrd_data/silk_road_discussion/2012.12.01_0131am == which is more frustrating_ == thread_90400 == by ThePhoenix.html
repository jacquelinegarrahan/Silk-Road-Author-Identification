				scenario 1): you have guy in your home town who has what you want. He is hard to reach on the phone sometimes. So you call and leave a message...and wait, because you don&#039;t want to piss him off...and you wait..and wait..then try again...you KNOW he has something because you bought some the other day and want more<br /><br />or<br /><br />scenario 2): you order on SR, and then decide to get a backup supply. You miscalculate the shipping days (like think you would def get it in 2 days of the 2-3 days shipping) and now have run out after being up for a while. With Saturday being the next day, you HOPE it will come Sat morning....<br /><br />which is more annoying?

				I first thought you said you have a six year supply at home. LOL<br /><br />yeah, being my first I was a little .... excited...and forgot. Its all good. Its been a year since we found anything so SR is AMAZING.<br /><br />Planning is key, but sometimes not controllable if the stuff is good and you go on a bender.<br /><br />

I hate that phrase but it kind of nails it here.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know. I guess most people who use have had reliable enough dealers that this is even a comparison. IRL dealers for me have almost always been more than simply a little unreliable - they were sketchy, paranoid, unpredictable, and untrustworthy on any level. You put up with it because (where I am at least) this is not the Land of 1000 Connections. Suddenly there&#039;s a place where you can access competing vendors and reputation is everything? Totally different ball game. I mean, no comparison whatsoever, for me.

				The first one, by far.<br /><br />Dealer dude is being kind of a dick not returning calls. Not getting your SR drugs in two days is not annoying, (shitty english) 2-3 days is actually excellent shipping time, I would never expect to get drugs in two days from when I order.

				Ok, I apparently needed to get my IRL dealer frustrations off my chest so thanks for that. :)<br /><br />More on point, I&#039;m not frustrated by the second, and also more inclined to do my part with a little patience and understanding on SR, than I am to do more than put up with IRL dealer capriciousness because I&#039;m stuck and have no other choice, which just compounds the frustration. So the first scenario by far.

				First one most def.<br /><br />Since I found the SR, I don&#039;t use dealers IRL anymore. I hate real people. It&#039;s incredible how I can trust someone across the country I&#039;ve never met more then the local dealers for anything around here. <br /><br />Why even buy from people in real life anymore lol I swear I&#039;ve lost well over $2000 in being robbed/burned and on here I&#039;ve made like 25 transactions and haven&#039;t had any issues whatsoever!<br /><br />thank god for this shit man.<br /><br />:D

				Yep Nodding, I echo that sentiment. All the dealers I know around here are fucksticks and no matter how much trust or loyalty you think you might have established they will burn you if they can. Definitely more frustrating. <br /><br />I hope SR is around for a long time. If I have to go back to buying my drugs the old way I will freak! Long Live SR!

				i would definitely be more frustrated with #1. with the silk road its in the mail and on its way. your waiting because it takes time for it to travel the distance. with the IRL dealer your waiting because he/she is a douche bag because they know they can get away with it because you will still keep coming back. if SR ever goes down i am fucked. i have completely severed ties (not angrily just havent called them in like 6 months lol)&nbsp; with all the asshole dealers in my area and i think i would just find a way to grow it myself or just quit doing drugs altogether before i would go back to that bullshit
