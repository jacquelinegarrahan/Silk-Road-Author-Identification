				It&#039;s over. Was just a very basic overview of the site as apparently they hadn&#039;t reported of it before, no mention of the Armory or any of the more recent news, though they did know about the 420 sale &amp; competition. They talked to a representative from NIDA who basically admitted that the site was reducing danger for users, as well as the fact they were currently unable to do anything about it. They claim to not know what country DPR was from. The rest of the presenters discuss pros of legalization, referencing recent successes in Portugal. Overall the piece seemed to be in favor of renewing drug policy.

				paranoid Paul chiming in.....<br /><br />I wonder if NIDA was trying to keep everyone feeling safe while maybe they cant do much about it, they certainly must be trying to devise a way to do MORE about it right?&nbsp; I mean that&#039;s their job.&nbsp; Cool that they mentioned it making it safer for people to use drugs, something I hadn&#039;t thought of.&nbsp; They would never say it if they knew where DPR was , they most likely have absolutely no idea (shhh.....He operates from Mars lol)&nbsp; but the paranoid side of me says that it is entirely POSSIBLE that they have some idea of where he might be and would play clueless knowing that we here at SR, including the Mars Legend himself would be the first to talk this up on the forums.&nbsp; (LEO tactic of lullling us into a (semi- false) sense of security and playing dumb in hopes of DPR or SR in general getting more leaky about things.<br /><br />i will add...the main concern isn&#039;t Australia, not to say that it isn&#039;t relevant, but&nbsp; most users of SR are in the US, and the devil knows how notorius and successful US agencies can be when they want to take something/someone down/they are fucking&nbsp; ruthless, rule-bending, and downright unfair about shit like this.&nbsp; The Senate is on this whole CISpA thing, I propose that a conglomerate of vendors move within a 50 mile radius of this proposed CISPA info spying center and all open catering/delivery services, providing only the most high quality LSD spiked doughnuts and iced coffees for these pig bellied analysts.&nbsp; I bet CISPA would turn to one huge digital kaleidoscope for collecting vivid color spectrums and deep web analysis of Abbey hoffman

				Wow, I&#039;m surprised how the show went at it. Seeing it was Australian, I assumed it would&#039;ve been a hardline, conservative analysis of it. It sounds like they almost conceded the profoundness of the system. Thank you for posting that!

				Interesting, so it sounds like it didn&#039;t really do any damage, except more people now know about SR.<br />Which was bound to happen anyway, if it weren&#039;t for SR who knows how many people would&#039;ve died from false drugs / murders / robberies.<br /><br />People will do drugs whether others like it or not, it&#039;s something that hasn&#039;t changed for all written history.

				That channel has been big on decriminalization recently. They&#039;ve had a couple of segments on it recently on the morning show and they are very pro-decriminalization. Maybe some big cats want too cash in?&nbsp;

				Publicity is bad. There are enough&nbsp; LE, jokers and wannabes here. Let&#039;s get rid of them. Then word of mouth and forum reviews will guide the real buyers to real sellers. Merchandizing and talking about SR is a bad idea. If this place goes down where are you going to go? Back to the corner? Don&#039;t screw it up for the rest of us, you Bozo.

				I think all this publicity can have it&#039;s benefits, if some of the organised crime syndicates start using SR we&#039;ll have some more local vendors that provide high quality products. The more local vendors the more competition which will finally bring down these steep prices.
