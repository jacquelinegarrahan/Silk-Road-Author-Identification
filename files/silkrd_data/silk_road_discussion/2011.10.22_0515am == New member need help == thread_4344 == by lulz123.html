				Hey guys i have some questions for you.<br /><br />When i order something here do i have to use my real address and name<br />or can i order it to my neighbors house (he moved out) ?<br /><br />And also does the package come in the mailbox or is it delivered to the door so i have to sign it?<br /><br />I live in Scandinavia if it matters.

				Its not wise to use your real name. It is preferable if you have a mailbox that is not linked to you or if you mail it to a friends house, but as SR posted, its best you read the buyers Guide.<br /><br />Try never to buy off anyone who makes you sign for the order. I know I would never make you sign for it. As for Scandinavia :D hei p√• deg!

				Ok thanks for the help everyone i found the guide, but also do you guys use that PGP encryption thing when you order?<br />Its probably gonna take a lot of time for me to figure out how that works :(

				God, I said the exact same thing myself. I know I shouldn&#039;t be frightened about new technology like that, but it really wasn&#039;t that bad to figure out.<br /><br />I got a nice link from Sun who helped me out. <br /><br />If you are on windows, like me, http://www.gpg4win.org/ &lt;--- type that in and hit the big green dl button.<br /><br />Then after that look to the right of the page. There will be a pink box with a list of different&nbsp; programs you can use. I picked GPA. After that you can create your own key (a public key you hand out to people)<br /><br />They take your key and they put it into their respective programs to be able to make a message unique to you. So that you can type in your password to open it when you try to decrypt it.<br /><br />^--- A guide to PGP For dummies by dummies :D

It is much more important to avoid unwanted attention in the first place than it is to try and have a preemptive alibi that garners you very little, if any, additional plausible deniability.<br /><br />Read the forums, there are far more stories of people regretting having used a fake name than there are stories of people who wish they had used a fake name.

				Mostly, just put a little thought into it.&nbsp; There are common sense ways around every problem.&nbsp; Many of us who have found out good ways, can&#039;t reveal them on here, simply because if our identity is discovered--and it&#039;s not *that* hard--it gives out too much information if someone were tracking us...we can only give advice &#039;in a general way&#039; as we operate on the theory that LE also reads here.<br /><br />So think about it a bit.&nbsp; Understand the rules, and then show a little common sense.&nbsp; Is your name misspelled at times?&nbsp; Did someone else use your address?&nbsp; Is there a secure mailbox that is unused at this time?&nbsp; Is there a business I know that goes to all the houses round here, and posts?<br />We can&#039;t hold people&#039;s hands, and anything revealed will be revealed to *everybody* and we don&#039;t want that...some of this stuff you&#039;re just going to have to figure out all by your lonesome...but the real truth is, you have no control over who sends you mail.&nbsp; You do have control over what you say if someone starts asking questions...<br /><br />And mostly, if shit *doesn&#039;t* show, and I&#039;ve used some unorthodox delivery system, then I damn sure can&#039;t go back on the seller.&nbsp; It&#039;s on me.
