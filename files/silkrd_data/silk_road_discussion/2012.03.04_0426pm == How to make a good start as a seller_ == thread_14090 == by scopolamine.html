				Hi everyone :)<br /><br />I just got my vendor account up and running and I&#039;m about to set up some listings.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be selling 2 products regularly, and want to make sure I establish my rep as best as I can.<br /><br />Since I&#039;m starting out with no feedback, what should I absolutely make sure not to miss out on doing for my first listings? (Finalizing, etc.)<br /><br />I am going to set my prices lower than my competition, but I don&#039;t want this to deter potential buyers by making it look suspicious... so, should I price my items close to my competitors prices?<br /><br />Should I make an announcement on the forum? On that note, I heard that I should link my listings with a PGP key... how does that work exactly..?<br /><br />Any advice at all would be most helpful. This is an awesome place and I am looking forward to selling you guys some good shit very soon. :)

				forum presence and sending out free samples is the best way because then people on the boards can rate and review your wares and shipping/customer service. <br /><br />Just make sure you are #1 Safe in shipping #2 have a quality product and #3 be as expedient as possible and people will love you here.

				Hello mate,<br /><br />I was lurking in the forums 2 months before getting my vendor acct to get a feel for the place and etiquette e.t.c and ended up sticking around...<br /><br />A forum announcement helps but I found it isn&#039;t necessary 90% of my customers don&#039;t even use the forums and despite my messages to them asking them to post up a honest review about me on the forums hardly any have bothered to post yet lol<br /><br />Right, let start with PGP, pretty simple just download a program called &quot;PortablePGP&quot; generate a PRIVATE keypair (keep to yourself) and copy the PUBLIC key (this is what you give to other people so they can send you encrypted messages).<br /><br />Whenver you want to decrypt a message, just copy and paste the message in the program click on &quot;Decrypt&quot; and that&#039;s that (check out tutorials online if you want but trust me using PGP is a lot easier then it sounds).<br /><br />On your first listings, make sure you lay down the &quot;ground rules&quot; these are your rules of business, have a look at other vendors profiles and see what they demand from their customers prior to ordering, remember your new so you&#039;ll have to cut some customers a bit of slack but nevertheless this is a good starting point.<br /><br />r.e pricing, I would say price it enough to make it worth-your-while + the Silk Road tax (check the &quot;State of the Road Address&quot; thread for more info). If the total price is still lower then your competitors then you&#039;ll do very well :)<br /><br />Any other questions just let us know.

				my advice is read the security and shipping threads. and the buyer and seller guide. and wiki. but that should go without saying<br /><br />If you want, make an announcement in the product offer section. many recommend free or discounted samples, but if you just offer reasonable prices within escrow you will eventually establish a reputation. samples just get it started more quickly and provide test runs so you can identify and correct any problems before charging people and having them label you as a scammer before you even get started for a simple mistake with shipping.<br /><br />you definitely need to provide a public key for people to encrypt their addresses<br /><br />make sure you learn how to package your goods to prevent them being profiled

				Well.... I put up my listings yesterday. I checked today and no sales... I don&#039;t get it...&nbsp; &nbsp;does it usually take this long? I lowered the price some more but this is as low as I can go...&nbsp; If anyone could check out my listings and offer some advice I&#039;d much appreciate it..<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d933f85233<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e13e07a2d5

				Not interested in what you have to offer but just stick it out. Once you get one or two orders and reviews I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have more and more coming in. Those first couple of orders will be your hardest.

				Welcome to vending on SR. I started a month ago and it&#039;s been great so far. Just make sure to be smart on how you ship and wear gloves and no prints. Best of luck to you!
