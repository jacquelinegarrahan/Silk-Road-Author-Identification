				Let me start this by saying I hope SR NEVER goes down for any reason. I hope it continues forever and I don&#039;t see any circumstances which would lead to DPR ever taking it offline and turning off the lights. BUT, god forbid that day came (be it a massive DDOS attack, LE somehow broke the laws of quantum physics and found the server, DPR&#039;s girlfriend got pissed he wasn&#039;t giving her enough attention and took a sledgehammer to the servers.. whatever).. what do you think will happen to all the vendors/buyers/lurkers on both the site and the forums? Where will we all congregate? Certainly not Reddit.&nbsp; BMR seems unlikely as well. I guess some vendors/buyers will continue to communicate via tormail and such (but without a proper ordering site and escrow.. shit will go south real quick with scams and all that).<br /><br />What is everyones thoughts? I hope this party never comes to an end..but where would we all migrate to if the plug got pulled?

				I am on BMR, and i&#039;ve enjoyed my experience there so far. The community is a lot smaller, but very helpful..sure its a little different, but I know when SR goes down, sales spike over at BMR..<br /><br />If SR ever does go down, I suspect a lot of people will migrate to BMR, as well as more markets opening up as well. Places like farmers market and SR really propelled a movement that I dont suspect will ever die

				True.. but remember SR was essentially low key and word of mouth and built itself slowly until that Andrew Chen article.. then the floodgates opened and it became &quot;mainstream&quot;. The rockstar status after that became a self fulfilling prophecy as more articles appeared, more people flocked to it.. etc etc. Don&#039;t know if BMR will ever have that &quot;perfect storm&quot; of circumstances in the event SR goes down?

				I doubt there will be much congregating. most people already have their plan B set, and their circle of friends chosen. If SR went down tomorrow, I imagine there will be another market pop up quite quickly, but who needs a marketplace after a few months networking on here (or years in some of our cases)

				It&#039;s not like if SR went down all these folks will suddenly forget about that time they used the deepweb &amp; bitcoin to buy drugs online, other sites will crop up and the userbase will migrate.&nbsp; Unless some government or governments find a way to really fuck up bitcoin and/or the tor network, that could put a dent in things until some new similar technology comes out.&nbsp; In a perfect world they&#039;d just finally give up and liberalize drug laws, but that won&#039;t happen any time soon, we all know how immune to reality politics is.

				I actually don&#039;t have a plan &quot;B&quot;. Though I was thinking of proposing the idea of a &quot;contingency plan&quot;, just the other night. <br /><br />There are a few problems in &quot;getting there&quot; <br />You&#039;d have to somehow arrange an alternate network, or even email/tormail chain that would keep us stocked up on the things we&#039;ve come to enjoy on a regular basis. <br /><br />One idea was to PM those I consider my closest friends on here. (both SR site+Forums), telling them my idea. - I figured they would think I was LE, for trying to get &quot;too close&quot;. So I abandoned the idea. <br /><br />Seeing your post of basically the same idea, has renewed my interest in trying it on a few people. I&#039;m coming up on a year being on SR. Though I only really &quot;got into&quot; the whole forums thing around the great blackout of Nov 2012. Which I still think had a lot to do with that Sandy Storm that hit the US just prior to the great SR blackout. - Either way, it was jarring enough to make most of us really start taking this place a lot more seriously. Suddenly I found myself guiding a few newbies through the whole BTC process and whatnot. I know what it&#039;s like to get shot down on a forum for asking a stupid question, or one that I should&#039;ve gone to &quot;this thread&quot; or &quot;that thread&quot;. It was like after that blackout of SR, people were less uptight about forum rules. (not that they&#039;re all bad). <br /><br />It was the anal retentiveness of certain forum members about the &quot;small stuff&quot; of rules, that initially kept me away, but when SR was down, and we had no where else to turn, suddenly these here forums were our only hope. <br /><br />So to answer the OP&#039;s original question? - Crazy!<br /><br />Though I appreciate you having the chutzpa to make it a topic, or thread, or whatever the hell it&#039;s called. <br /><br />It should prompt a lot of ideas in all of us. The thing is, if you DO come up with a good contingency plan, you have to keep it to yourself, or just those in that &quot;inner circle&quot; who you somehow trust, but still never truly know if they&#039;re just playing the forums to gather intelligence. <br /><br />There are many people that want this taken down, and I don&#039;t mean the phony politicians like Schumer acting as if he&#039;s &quot;saving the children&quot; or some idiotic catchphrase. I mean the dark forces that exist and control what goes on in this world, and keep most of us under the impression that we live in sovereign nations, and have fair elections. <br /><br />They hate freedom and liberty. Most of all they hate for people to make money that they&#039;re not able to take a piece off the top of. <br /><br />I&#039;ll leave it at that. I don&#039;t want to rouse suspicion. If you know what I mean, then you do. <br /><br />Thanks for helping me remember this very important idea. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be working on it tonight with a few of my close comrades on here. See what happens. I&#039;ll report back. <br /><br />To the idea that all would go to BMR, sure, it works, I&#039;ve tried it, but what if they hold the entire Tor website in contempt for facilitating this illegal activity? And Tor is taken down?<br /><br />You can kiss it ALL goodbye! <br /><br />BTW they&#039;re are a few others that I know of, but they also allow stuff that is morally reprehensible, and although I like to fancy myself a conservative libertarian, I&#039;m not THAT libertarian. <br /><br />Gave me a lot to ponder tonight. Thanks!<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug 8) <br /><br />PS I do see it ending one day, where contingency plans involving the internet might be of no use. What if they put bans on internet usage? - With the current crop of eggheads from academia running things here in the US, I see a clear and present danger that not only would they do that, but worse! - Let&#039;s just hope these fascists don&#039;t get their way with the 3 years they have left.&nbsp; <br />

				Jagfug: Well said. I think the idea of having some kind of Plan B is interesting. Would hate to see that day ever come.. but you never know.<br /><br />Aurelius: I will be doing the same thing I think. But how would trusted business take place? If a buyer and vendor have a good relationship on SR, whats to say that will keep them from scamming each other when its just person to person tormail dealings? No escrow? No resolutions? No feedback system?
