				Well... I was almost done posting orders and payments and now I&#039;m getting what seems to be a the more common SR home page. &quot;The connection has timed out. The server at silkroadvb5piz3r.onion is taking too long to respond.&quot; Would anybody mind gong back to bed for a while so a guy can buy some drugs? LOL&nbsp; ;)
