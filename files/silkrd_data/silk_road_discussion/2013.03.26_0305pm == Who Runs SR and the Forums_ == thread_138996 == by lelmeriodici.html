				After the maintenance downtime and a question I saw in support asking whether SR staff worked weekends&nbsp; :P ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138761.0;topicseen ) I&#039;m curious about how much we know about this site...<br /><br />Does DPR run it alone, doing all the IT and resolution center stuff, or does he have a staff?&nbsp; And are the forums also run by him?<br /><br />Hope I don&#039;t get banned for asking.&nbsp; :o <br /><br />lelmeriodici

				The world may never know!<br />These are questions that shouldn&#039;t be asked I believe. These kinds of things should be left alone. The only reason this place is running is because of anonymity, and we all must not only help and protect our identity but DPR and the staff as well.<br /><br />If you just look around you can clearly see that it&#039;s DPR and a staff. I&#039;d write more and have questions to propose as well but as stated, I will hold them back. We must all look out for each other. &lt;3<br /><br />Btw OP I&#039;d watch out with some of these topics you make. Everyone questions (completely natural and healthy!) but as stated, respect even questioning the anonymity of others.

				Too much work for one person. Has to be a few! How many orders per week go through here and resolution issues to deal with that go with that. What other work needs doing? Probably started off by one person but as it grew, more staff were needed to cope with it&#039;s growth.<br /><br />Only problem with that is once more than one person knows about the overall setup, the risk of someone singing is high! People can&#039;t hold their piss and someone will always almost burst dying to tell someone what they are involved in.<br /><br />Actually, after saying the above, when the site went down for a few days, it wasn&#039;t spotted because DPR was away I think he/she/they said so maybe it is only 1 person

B. around here if you ask a question about the operation, you are looked at like you are either a cop or&nbsp; an idiot and they are both the same thing so I will stop here. <br /><br />Then with you throwing out your dollar amount in your account, you say it as if that is a lot of money and you NEED to know who is in charge. And though all of us would agree $457 is a lot of money in the real world...in here it is shit. Like a penny. So no one gives a fuck about you and your $457 nor do any of us think you deserve the answer BECAUSE of the amount of money in your account. <br /><br />I can tell you that I have been here for over a year and a vendor for almost a year. And in my account has been 100&#039;s x that amount and I have never once been concerned or worried about who owns the place or if my money is safe. It is safe. And the owner has a huge amount of integrity and is totally trusted by all who routinely have 6 figures in their account.<br /><br />For all intensive purposes DPR owns and operates the place. And that is all you need to know.<br /><br />&nbsp;I think if you didn&#039;t throw out the dollar amount you had in your account and make it like because of that you should know who is in charge. you would have maybe been answered with the answer &quot;DPR&quot; a lot faster. Then again you would have to be stupid and only on here for 15min not to know that. And then you would have to be on here less then 30 min to realize asking those type questions are a big NO NO. As it is none of your business. <br /><br />NONE.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

B. around here if you ask a question about the operation, you are looked at like you are either a cop or&nbsp; an idiot and they are both the same thing so I will stop here. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No one knows.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; That&#039;s literally all I had to know.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I think I look like a retarded cop, so no worries there....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Then with you throwing out your dollar amount in your account, you say it as if that is a lot of money and you NEED to know who is in charge. And though all of us would agree $457 is a lot of money in the real world...in here it is shit. Like a penny. So no one gives a fuck about you and your $457 nor do any of us think you deserve the answer BECAUSE of the amount of money in your account. <br /><br />I can tell you that I have been here for over a year and a vendor for almost a year. And in my account has been 100&#039;s x that amount and I have never once been concerned or worried about who owns the place or if my money is safe. It is safe. And the owner has a huge amount of integrity and is totally trusted by all who routinely have 6 figures in their account.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No shit its nothing, it just happened to be the amount in my account when I woke up today.&nbsp; Anyways, you vendors have a feature that automatically funnels money out of SR whenever a user finalizes.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t you turn that on?&nbsp; Leaving 50k on an anonymous and unreliable site is a dumb idea.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For all intensive purposes DPR owns and operates the place. And that is all you need to know.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Once again, that&#039;s all I needed to know.... Thank you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I think if you didn&#039;t throw out the dollar amount you had in your account and make it like because of that you should know who is in charge. you would have maybe been answered with the answer &quot;DPR&quot; a lot faster. Then again you would have to be stupid and only on here for 15min not to know that. And then you would have to be on here less then 30 min to realize asking those type questions are a big NO NO. As it is none of your business. <br /><br />NONE.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>In my original post I mentioned DPR, I am fully aware he is in charge.<br /><br /><br />CrazyBart, I&#039;m not concerned about my $457, just curious.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: I thought about it a bit and I&#039;m happy to see the responses I did.&nbsp; It&#039;s good to see a community that so thoroughly trusts and defends its system.&nbsp; I have more trust in the SR just from these responses.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll stop the negative karma mongering now.&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />lelmeriodici<br /><br />
