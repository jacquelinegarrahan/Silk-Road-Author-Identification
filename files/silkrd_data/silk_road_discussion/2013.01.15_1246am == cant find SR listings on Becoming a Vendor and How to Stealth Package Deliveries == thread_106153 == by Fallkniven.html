				When i first joined SR i found some listings by someone (cant remember who) that were for something like Stealth Shipping Techniques and Tips on Vending, stuff like that. They may have been PDF&#039;s and been around a few hundred dollars if i recall correctly?<br /><br />I am now in the position of being able to vend products on SR and have read a whole bunch of great, informative threads on the forums over the last few weeks - but i&#039;m still not satisfied that i know enough to start selling. Does anyone have any bookmarks or remember any other good forum threads or SR listings on becoming a SR vendor and how to cash out bitcoins and stuff like that?<br /><br />I found this one by EnterTheMatrix - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d965fce00c - sounds great, everything i need, but $2000 is a lot to spend on Tips and advice to start selling.<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance for any replies, but please try to refrain from telling me to &#039;use the forum search function&#039;, that&#039;s what i have been doing over the last few weeks, i know there is always someone who remembers some good info stashed away in that dark corner of the forum.

				Too detailed answers on these subjects can be coiuntervproductive and cause the wrong ppl to become of the techs and then start identifying them and reducing success in deliveries.<br />That&#039;s why it&#039;s a no no to mention how a vendor packaged an order you receive.<br /><br />Ok I&#039;ve said my bit, loose lips sink ships.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				No vendor will tell you how we package our products. <br /><br />Totally counterproductive if we were ever being watched. <br /><br />Order from people that have good feedback in the packaging area and get some tips from that.

				Thanks very much for the offer Slicksuit, but you are right in what you said, I will keep searching the forums for more information.<br /><br />I have plenty of time to read about it (which i&#039;ve been doing so much my eyes hurt). I&#039;d just rather wait until i&#039;m sure that i know everything i need to, to be successful on SR and stay ahead of the float in case any shit happens. There are still a few things i&#039;m yet to learn that i think are very &#039;country specific&#039; (cashing out bitcoins mainly).<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure i never asked anyone to divulge their super stealth secrects to me, rather just point the way (if they knew) to any posts or listings regarding selling on SR that have already been divulged.
