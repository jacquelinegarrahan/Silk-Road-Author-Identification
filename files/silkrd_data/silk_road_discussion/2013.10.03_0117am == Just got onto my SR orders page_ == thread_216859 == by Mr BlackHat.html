A lot of people just made orders and a) got their don&#039;t sent but did not yet finalize b) don&#039;t know if the vendor sent the order yet or c) made the order and the vendor did not send it yet.<br /><br />A lot of people are out a lot of money.

				This is fucking ridiculous, I post up giving an insight on what I can see with a screenshot, not as proof, just so you can see what I can see, not for you all to turn around and start saying that my screenshot is faked? Look at the time the screenshot was taken to the time it was posted (minutes apart).<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a clue why the boxes aren&#039;t in alignment, probably because SR is fucked right now?<br /><br />Not sure if it was a cached page but I didn&#039;t have to login..

I&#039;m NOT saying that nobody got arrested yesterday. I&#039;m NOT even saying there wasn&#039;t a bust. <br /><br />But the one thing that is fucking clear is that the seizure notice on the SR site is an amateur fake, which is why there&#039;s a fucking watermark of the SR logo on it. They don&#039;t custom design seizure notices, so it&#039;s not the Feds being cute as some people claim. I don&#039;t understand why someone would use such an obvious fake when there are so many copies available on the web, but it doesn&#039;t matter at the end of the day.<br /><br />Christ you can even download them in pdf format from the government&#039;s civil forfeiture website, so I don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />Seizure notices say &quot;this DOMAIN name has been seized,&quot; NOT &quot;this HIDDEN SITE has been seized.&quot; Who knows why, but the NOTICE is fake! The images are low-res garbage that look like they&#039;ve been scanned by a shitty scanner. Wikipedia has better images of the US government ensignias. The format is different. The fonts are different.

				I&#039;m sorry but you really have to be ignorant of LEOs history with underground websites to think a friggin SR watermark means the notice is fake.

I&#039;m NOT saying that nobody got arrested yesterday. I&#039;m NOT even saying there wasn&#039;t a bust. <br /><br />But the one thing that is fucking clear is that the seizure notice on the SR site is an amateur fake, which is why there&#039;s a fucking watermark of the SR logo on it. They don&#039;t custom design seizure notices, so it&#039;s not the Feds being cute as some people claim. I don&#039;t understand why someone would use such an obvious fake when there are so many copies available on the web, but it doesn&#039;t matter at the end of the day.<br /><br />Christ you can even download them in pdf format from the government&#039;s civil forfeiture website, so I don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />Seizure notices say &quot;this DOMAIN name has been seized,&quot; NOT &quot;this HIDDEN SITE has been seized.&quot; Who knows why, but the NOTICE is fake! The images are low-res garbage that look like they&#039;ve been scanned by a shitty scanner. Wikipedia has better images of the US government ensignias. The format is different. The fonts are different.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Of course it doesn&#039;t say &quot;DOMAIN&quot;. They didn&#039;t seize any domain as that is not possible with Tor infrastructure. There is no such thing as domains regarding hidden services. It&#039;s just a hash based on the public key of the HIDDEN SERVICE.

				all I can say is that you are all welcome to believe that this is an elaborate hoax perpertrated by the US government.&nbsp; As it&#039;s not April 1, I&#039;m not really seeing why they&#039;re doing it but go crazy with your theories.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just say that the government is in shutdown mode atm so all non essential staff are not only laid off but have been told that if they access their work accounts then they&#039;ll be disciplined.&nbsp; My guess is that since they have no clerical staff, one of them got volunteered to create the takedown notice.&nbsp; Whatever the reason for it though, it&#039;s done and the site is gone.&nbsp; Get over it.<br /><br />Seriously guys, haven&#039;t you read the document they used to get the arrest warrant?&nbsp; This isn&#039;t some April Fool.

I thought it was set up with the DPR persona so that if any one individual retires, dies, or is arrested, the community would continue on. Did the government succeed in driving enough fear into those that can reestablish the site to hold their efforts towards doing so? Or, are there efforts being made towards relaunching the site without stating it in the forum until things are more substantiated? United we stand, divided we fall.
