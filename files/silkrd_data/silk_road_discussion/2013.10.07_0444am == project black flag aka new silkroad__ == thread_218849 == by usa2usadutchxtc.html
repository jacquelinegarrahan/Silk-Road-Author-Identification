				so there is now project black flag which is a mimic of SR. the forums are up now and they are identical to SR. they are working on the market and it will have the same logo and same set up. the &quot;new&quot; guy is metaDPR i believe. so far forums look real good, just like old SR. it seems good so far but who knows. anyone have thoughts on this place yet?

Metta DPR has been taking in suggestion from forum members to help build a better site. He&#039;s very big on everyone using PGP and such. And I really like the idea of it being stressed tested by hackers to make sure it&#039;s very safe. Also I have no idea about any of the history/security behind BMR and the sheep. So having a site being built before my very eyes is a nice comfort.

				I should like to know the opinion of reputable members on this project. Specifically, StExo, Pine, Libertas, etc. <br /><br />Metta-DPR says he may release the source code. That is encouraging.
