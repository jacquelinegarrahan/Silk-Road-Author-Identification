				I ordered a massive order from Supertrips. I have heard he has had some delays lately but that is somewhat besides the point. I had to leave on a last minute emergency business trip a few days after placing the order. I was gone a couple weeks and didn&#039;t have time to take care of my account. My significant other who is experienced on here said she would handle it. I got back and she had only taken care of my other account and when I checked this one and it had autofinalized 9 days before. So I contacted SR Support since a package had still never arrived. The replied by sending me a massive list of detailed info regarding the two purchases from Supertrips and at the end all they said was send this to them and it will be taken care of. do they mean send it to Supertrips or some other mod on sr? I am extremely confused because Supertrips hasnt even replied to my message yet and idk why sending him this info would help things. Is there some higher up that I would send it to on SR rather than SR support? <br />Any help would be much appreciated. I am a very good buyer that always leaves feedback immediately but this was just a freak occurance.

				well take it as a learning experience. just because you &quot;didnt have time to take care of your account&quot; for three entire weeks and then blaming it on others is a poor excuse to me.&nbsp; if you were only gone a couple weeks and left a few days after the order, whered the additional 9 days you waited to handle the issue come from? <br /><br />no matter the reason, if the order is finalized the funds are released and there is nothing you should expect SR to do for you. its your fault. i know i am not just going to ignore a &quot;massive order&quot;&nbsp; especially if you have multiple accts, you know how the system works. there can be no claims that you didnt realize it was going to auto-fin or how long you had left... you should probably blame yourself for not taking more care to ensure auto-fin did not occur by clearly informing your partner what was expected of them - you shouldnt blame them if you didnt clarify<br /><br />i dont understand, if SR support sent you the information, why would you need to send it back to them - what would that accomplish? they obviously have the info cause they were the ones who gave it to you. whyd you mention two orders, you were only talking about one... they were probably providing the info to give to the vendor to figure out the order info<br /><br />what do you expect SR support to do for you exactly?<br /><br />since you contacted the vendor and they didnt reply then there really isnt anything you can do. if i was a vendor i dont know if i would believe a buyer after three weeks, unless you have tracking to prove it never arrived...&nbsp; which you should for a &quot;massive order&quot;&nbsp; - if they dont respond then you can leave negative feedback, but if you have no evidence the order didnt arrive then you shouldnt expect ST to give you your money back or anything. <br /><br />something just doesnt seem right about this to me. sounds like you are just trying to get more product or your money back. i dont believe you would be that careless with a large amount of money <br /><br />you know what my main problem with your claims? you cant even keep your story straight between the two threads you have about the same topic. then you are even asking questions about pills from supertrips on the 10th, and now its two weeks later and your posting again? so you left a few days after ordering... which makes it two weeks until auto-finalization would occur, yet then there is an additional week and a half since your funds were released??? that doest fucking add up.&nbsp; if you really placed the order a month ago as you claim, by your posts on the forum there is no your story can be accurate, which leads me to believe you are lying. <br /><br />in your post above you claim your partner was checking your accounts, but they didnt know to check the one with the order... then in your other thread which i quoted below you claim she couldnt get on SR at all??? what the fuck is up with that? <br /><br />i get the feeling you are trying to take advantage of the system and i dont appreciate how i feel you are disrespecting the community and lying to all of us.&nbsp; please clarify these discrepancies or you will be reported to super trips and SR support. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45522.msg484637#msg484637">Quote from: mollysbf on September 25, 2012, 05:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So I placed an order about a month ago with supertrips and I had to go out of town on business.

I got home today and realized SR sent me messages nine days ago because I guess that is when the resolution or finalize stage began. Anyway there is only the option to leave him feedback at this point. They have obviously given him all my money already. I will wait for a reply from him first but if I get no response should I just leave 1 as the feedback for both items? This was a large order 1k+<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Auto-finalizing is a vendor&#039;s pet hate, and rightly so. I&#039;m not understanding your need for more than one account. That doesn&#039;t make any sense to me other than you may have had some problems previously which forced you to open another account. At the end of the day, your in the hands of Supertrips. SR won&#039;t help you so all you can do is keep trying to contact the vendor and pray.

				Something really seems fishy about this to me as well.<br /><br />As was mentioned in that very long post most people won&#039;t read completely:<br />1) In one thread you claim your partner was checking your account, then in another you claim your partner did not have access to SR.<br />2) Your claim the order was a month ago and you were gone for a few weeks, but clearly you have posted only two weeks apart on the forum? The timeline you provided can&#039;t be accurate.<br /><br />If you are trying to pull a reverse scam, you should have more appreciation for the community and the wonderful benefits provided through SR and escrow protection. Buyers taking advantage of the system ruin it for everyone, why do you think vendors are starting to require all orders are FE? People need to stop being so selfish and realize if they continue scamming SR will be destroyed. No one will be willing to use escrow and we all will either have no protection from scams or SR will just shut down completely. Makes me sad.<br />

				So it&#039;s also my fault the order never came? I understand I fucked up but a have a demanding IRL job and this was kind of a freak occurance. My story is perfectly straight. It was a massive order placed with Supertrips. It consisted of two different products purchased at the same time resulting in two different transaction numbers. I just heard back from SR and they said the info they gave me was to be given to SuperTrips. Regardless of whether I let it auto-finalize that is no excuse as to why there shouldn&#039;t be product here.<br />I made this post to see if anyone had any pointers....not to be called out for being some kind of idiot or scammer. This community used to be about helping people and it obviously isn&#039;t that anymore<br /><br />and regarding some of the other claims....I shouldn&#039;t have to explain this but if I must. here is what SR sent me. I am sorry I don&#039;t remember exact dates off the top of my head. I had my wife checking my account but not this one, when I said she didnt have access to SR I meant she couldn&#039;t access this account because she didn&#039;t have the login info. I am paranoid and sure as hell wasn&#039;t going to text it to her or say it over the phone. Quit pointing fingers like I am a scammer of some kind. I am sure as hell not the only one not receiving from supertrips and it&#039;s my first time ordering from him. I understand it is a lesson learned and I will take it as that but all I did was ask if anyone had any ideas. If not then don&#039;t reply. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money was released because it auto-finalized, staff didn&#039;t send it to them.<br /><br />Forward these to them, they&#039;ll take care of it.<br /><br />Transaction #46d05bf4b4<br />status: finalized<br />buyer: mollysbf<br />seller: SuperTrips(98)<br />contract: Standard Escrow v1.0<br />item: 25x 180mg Red Questionmarks ©<br />quantity: 1<br />payment btc: ฿18.66<br />commission btc: ฿1.55<br />payment usd: $189.99<br />commission usd: $15.78<br />shipping: Free Worldwide Shipping<br />postage btc: ฿0.00<br />postage usd: $0.00<br />ordered: September 5, 2012, 4:56 pm UTC<br />shipped: September 5, 2012, 8:57 pm UTC<br />finalized: September 22, 2012, 10:00 pm UTC<br /><br />action amount time<br />slippage ฿3.74 September 22, 2012, 10:02 pm UTC<br />commission ฿1.26 September 22, 2012, 10:02 pm UTC<br />payment ฿15.21 September 22, 2012, 10:02 pm UTC<br />purchase ฿-20.21 September 5, 2012, 4:56 pm UTC<br /><br />Transaction #bb89864336<br />status: finalized<br />buyer: mollysbf<br />seller: SuperTrips(98)<br />contract: Standard Escrow v1.0<br />item: 28g/1 Ounce of MDMA Crystals<br />quantity: 1<br />payment btc: ฿83.23<br />commission btc: ฿3.45<br />payment usd: $846.89<br />commission usd: $35.10<br />shipping: Free Worldwide Shipping<br />postage btc: ฿0.00<br />postage usd: $0.00<br />ordered: September 5, 2012, 4:50 pm UTC<br />shipped: September 5, 2012, 8:57 pm UTC<br />finalized: September 22, 2012, 10:00 pm UTC<br /><br />action amount time<br />slippage ฿16.07 September 22, 2012, 10:02 pm UTC<br />commission ฿2.81 September 22, 2012, 10:02 pm UTC<br />payment ฿67.80 September 22, 2012, 10:02 pm UTC<br />purchase ฿-86.68 September 5, 2012, 4:50 pm UTC<br /><br />~SR Support

				i never said it was your fault the order didnt show nor did i call you names like an idiot... just that it is definitely your fault the order auto-finalized. i checked supertrips feedback, and he seems to be backlogged, not answering messages across the board, and the orders that are arriving have taken a VERY long time. if it is the case other orders are not arriving then that is a different story.&nbsp; <br /><br />i appreciate you trying to clarify, since i asked, but your story wasnt perfectly straight, thats why i didnt believe you. still there continue to be a few too many faults in your claims for it to sound completely convincing to me at least, but i am extremely skeptical about any claims without at least a small bit of evidence. even now you just posted in your original post that it auto-finalized 9 days ago... yet you had already received the info about the orders, so you dont have to remember any dates, they were provided for you - yet you still report it incorrectly, which is what i just dont understand - since it was only four days.&nbsp; even if it was accidental - still compromises your believability <br /><br />i apologize, but if you want to make a claim about an order not arriving, given all the recent reverse scams, your story has to be completely accurate when you are talking about such a large amount of money... you have to have hard evidence, such as tracking which evidently supertrips does not offer. in the future for large orders i would recommend using a vendor that offers tracking if you are going to have such large sums riding on the shipment... then you would actually have a reasonable amount of proof that your order did not arrive.<br /><br />supertrips offers a refund policy. you could try sending the info to him, but like was mentioned dont expect to much help given the fact you let the order auto-finalize. and especially not with your refund rate which you mentioned in a forum post was around 25 percent i believe unless it has changed since that post<br /><br />you may have gotten unlucky and ended up finalizing when your order wasnt sent at all, or it could have been due to customs interceptions. maybe you will receive a love letter and then have the evidence you need to ask ST for a refund.&nbsp; <br /><br />hopefully ST was just backlogged - possibly your order took a while to get out and&nbsp; is currently on the way. if you are lucky maybe your order will arrive soon.

				I sent the info to him as SR requested. I said 9 days before because I was just on the forums, not sr, after a few drinks and didn&#039;t feel like looking it up. Obviously I am bad with timelines though lol. Either way I never came here to trash SuperTrips in anyway just to make that clear. I came to ask a simple question of how that should be handled. Trust me I know how annoying it is to have to wait for things to auto-finaliize, I used to vend but lost my connect. Thanks for the help and sorry for the misunderstanding but I am not a scammer and get pretty riled up for being accused of it because this is the first time. Emergency shit happens and thats what happened. I wasn&#039;t going to turn down a massive badass IRL job just to check up on an order that should arrive regardless. There&#039;s a difference between excuses and reasons.

				God. I knew there was a reason I loved old Modest Mouse.<br />This dude is a fucking UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATOR FOR FUCKING SURE.. haha.<br />And if you are not.. you should be! This dude should work for SR Scam Prevention.<br /><br />Hahaa... As much love as I can possibly give you Modest Mouse, it has been given.<br />I was trying to go to sleep.. but got the link to this thread in another thread.<br />Then decided to read it, read your first post, then your second one.. spot on.<br /><br />And my little .02BTC... would be: If it is your first time ordering from an international vendor.. why go ahead and splurge on 1k+ worth of product, EVEN after reading that his product hasn&#039;t been arriving? Never arrived.. or did you find an easy way to get product and make BTC? Hm.. the choices the claims. We, over here, all wish you the best of luck. Take care and good night.<br /><br /><br /><br />In body and mind,<br />Jah.
