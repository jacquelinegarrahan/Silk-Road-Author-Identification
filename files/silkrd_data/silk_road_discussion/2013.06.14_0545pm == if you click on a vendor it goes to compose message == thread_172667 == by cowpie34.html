Typically the reasons for a vendor to be banned will be either scamming or threatening buyers. The other reason is that a vendor who has gone rogue has already pulled a scam, and they are morphing to new buyer identity, along with a new vending acc./ and deleting the old one in the process.<br /><br />In either of these cases, when you click on a name you will be directed to compose a message instead of loading the vendor&#039;s page.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I have been reading a lot of things on the forums and I think he got banned due to selling counterfeit money.&nbsp; Some even said it could be LE trying to see if anyone would order.&nbsp; I was not buying money...something else...but still hope he was just being stupid and not ulterior motives.&nbsp; Hmmm....<br /><br />Any thoughts?

				Its not always because a vendor is a scammer or banned!!!<br /><br />We vendors can put our account on &quot;vacation&quot; mode or &quot;stealth&quot; mode - both remove us from the public eye (although I believe on stealth mode your vendor page still shows but I&#039;m not 100% on this).&nbsp; However, if your in vacation mode it goes straight to a message- hence you are on vacation. :) On stealth mode- buyers who have saved the url to your item can still buy as you are still up and running yet only for your current client base.
