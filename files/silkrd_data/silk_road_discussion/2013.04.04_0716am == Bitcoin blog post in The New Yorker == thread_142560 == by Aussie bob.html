				The story is April 2 , 2013<br /><br />Lets try to predict when people will read the story , react to it, talk about it around the water cooler , and then learn about bit Coin .&nbsp; And then , a flood of new people will be buying up coins and driving price up again (!) <br /><br />I&#039;m betting it will take 2 days to see the jump in bit coin prices .&nbsp; Spain is buying like madmen , but if yu notice its slowed down last night.&nbsp; &nbsp; Coins are actually down a bit.&nbsp; So the Spain rush is over.&nbsp; The bit coin stories in their news media have all run already.&nbsp; It&#039;s old news there now.&nbsp; <br /><br />The next wave is coming.&nbsp; This time Americans who really trust the New Yorker newspaper.&nbsp; <br /><br />If another country takes on bitcoin it will rise another $100.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think this flood will rise the price to only $165. B the end of the week. <br /><br />Any other speculators? <br /><br />

				American New Yorker readers are, on average, more affluent than the average American. More dollars to invest in high risk high gain ventures :)

				I vaguely remember reading a forumpost where a guy speculated this current upwards trend would halt or a pricedrop would happen around this time (begin of april) due to taxreturns which would mean less investment money.<br />But i cant judge any of these predictions on value, i know nothing about the financial system...<br />I started reading alot of posts on bitcointalk forum, but i find it impossible to rate predictions or posters, my impression is that its anyones guess.<br />I feel clueless on what todo sell and be safe and glad with the sick return so far and pray for a crash. Or buy in proper even at this stage and earn some proper dollars riding this seemingly endless surge.<br />I guess nobody knows for real, its probably the reason its called speculation lol. <br />I&#039;m starting to understand people jumping out of windows in that big crash in the 30s, i only bought a little, money i could lose without feeling to bad and still its nerve wracking like nothing else, especially when i&#039;m at work and in the dark, wondering if THE crash has happened yet)<br />Tomorrow my oldschool ass is going to buy a smartphone to better monitor this &#039;event&#039; , i need more control to have the nerve to keep holding my coins. It cant keep rising forever i would think...pfff i&#039;m not cut out to be a speculator hehehe

				good to see more acceptance for bitcoins in mainstream media....normally they busy covering bank seizures, financial crashes worldwide and govt bailouts....now the next question developing in next 2-3 years is who will bailout the governments after absorbing all these bad loans<br /><br />govt do not have infinite resources and in long term they selling ourselves to money hungry sharks....if they bets by these high pawn brokers go wrong we get higher taxes and seizures...its high time more people realise this game and start putting part of their saving in bitcoins..it will serve them better than banks for sure<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d call TNY mainstream media... it&#039;s more media for a smallish circle of wealthy hyper-educated American liberals. I agree, though, increased coverage of this type is a good thing! You just need to look at what Germany, Denmark and the Finns are trying to do to Cyprus to see where the fiat system is heading. Banks are tax payer funded to the tune of billions, while the smallest account holder sees their life long savings drained to support a corrupt, rotting hegemony. Live long cryptocurrency.
