				I really don&#039;t understand what is up with SR, I put my patches on sale and not one person has grabbed one since they went on sale. This happened last week as well then all of the sudden I received multiple orders all at once, as if people had not been able to access the site.<br /><br />Usually when I post an ad in &quot;Product Offers&quot; it is at the very bottom or next page within hours because of the new threads. Today I posted one and it is still somewhat near the top from earlier. What gives here? Can fellow vendors give me some insight into this? SR was much more consistent a couple months ago, just trying to figure out what the reason is, because there has to be one, my patches are the cheapest deal on SR for that product right now.

				I dunno I&#039;m a first time buyer and I&#039;m having a real hard time trying to find a decent vendor to buy from. the only order i made got cancelled and lost almost .3 BTC just to the hedging really irks me. Seems like vendors have their established consumer base and alot aren&#039;t even open to people new to the Silk Road

				Alright, let&#039;s be real for a minute here. Adderall is extremely easy to find everywhere and sure as fuck doesn&#039;t cost as much as Oxy. Furthermore, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ve considered your competition on the Fentanyl front. Take a look at SunWu&#039;s vendor page when you get a minute man. Good luck, I hope you can find a market that works for you.

SR is the Spot and will remain unless a quantum shift occurs forcing buyers leave in droves. Its not destined to die because its small, its destined to die because the buyers are still on the road.
