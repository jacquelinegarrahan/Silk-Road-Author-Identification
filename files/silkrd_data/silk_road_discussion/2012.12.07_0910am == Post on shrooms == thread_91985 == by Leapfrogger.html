				*** - a big shoutout to USAShroomz for making this post possible. ;)<br /><br />First of all, thank God for fucking psilocybin. I mean it. I&#039;ve been banging my head against the wall for six months with alcohol trying to feel anything at all, only to have psilocybin step in and finally allow me to really FEEL the fucking pain I&#039;ve been living with for the past year, if only for a few precious minutes (or, knowing what psilocybin does to time and as hard as I would find it to believe, quite possibly only a few seconds). I just lay there and fucking relished it and it was so naked and horrifying and I was so thankful to be able to just fucking HURT after being completely numb for so long.<br /><br />Seriously, guys, psilocybin is not fucking Acid Lite. Get into it!<br /><br />Gosh, what else!<br /><br />Silk Road is Napster.<br /><br />I was in my early teens when Napster &quot;came out.&quot; It was an amazing thing that is now taken for granted, but yeah, for the very first time ever you could type in any song you wanted to hear and be listening to it only minutes later! It was nuts.<br /><br />Napster didn&#039;t last too long as Napster, of course. It disappeared and countless other more or less dependable services took its place, and then the RIAA started sending out letters and everyone gets fucking SCARED. But you got the point: you can get music (or now movies or anything else your bandwidth can accommodate) for free if you know where to go. And your chances of &quot;getting caught&quot;, while very real, represent a remote enough possibility that you don&#039;t spend every waking moment worrying about it. <br /><br />Yeah, the RIAA and MPAA are still sending out letters. If you wanna play it really safe, you spend the hour at the coffee shop and use their wifi to download last night&#039;s episode of Breaking Bad. Hey, if you&#039;re gonna go to the trouble of subpoenaing the fucking security camera footage, fine, you got me. But we both know you&#039;re not gonna go to that much trouble. There&#039;s plenty of lower hanging fruit. Go after and make an example of whomever makes you look best.<br /><br />You see where I&#039;m going with this. The cat&#039;s out of the bag. You can order drugs online and have them delivered to your door, quickly enough and reliably enough that you can bitch about it when it occasionally goes wrong. But it usually works, and that&#039;s fucking magical. And that&#039;s something the current generation, at least those who are paying close enough attention, are going to grow up accepting as second nature: information is free, and drugs are- well certainly not free, (now THAT would be a breakthrough)- but relatively easily obtainable for a fair price with a manageable risk. The RIAA and MPAA and customs will continue making examples out of the tiny fraction of offenders they manage to catch and it will become more and more complicated, but the cat&#039;s out of the bag. It&#039;s over. We won.<br /><br />It&#039;s already been said a million times but that doesn&#039;t make it any less amazing. So thanks, DPR!<br /><br />And thanks again to USAshroomz for giving me more catharsis for 4 BTC than thousands of dollars in psych bills could ever deliver! Goddamn.<br /><br />Too tired to proofread. (Edit: I lied. Had to fix a typo and change the painfully-pretentious-even-for-being-on-shrooms topic title, which, in case you&#039;re curious, was &quot;What I know so far...&quot; Please forgive me lol.)<br /><br />Thanks for reading. Good night.

				I completely understand. Drugs have helped me to feel pain I otherwise kept numb, as well as pain I didn&#039;t even know I had, and begin to work through it. I have so much more emotion and I am no longer scared of my feelings. It&#039;s pretty beautiful.

				First time I tripped on mushrooms i broke down in tears because of the overwhelming beauty of everything around me. It was the only trip I have ever taken alone, but I am very glad I was alone that first time, i got to get in touch with something deep and powerful. <br /><br />Like the doc tryptamine said, the mushroom is a gift and can be a very potent tool for healing. My experiences changed my life and perspective forever, and I am now able to recognize the simple beauty of life all around me.
