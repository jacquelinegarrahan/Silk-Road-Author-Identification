				The current price is 37.79 Bitcoins. Also getting bitcoins is quite easy nowadays, just go to bitinstant.com and choose to deposit to your wallet (or SR account), if you choose to do a moneygram order, you can take your cash to any store that has the MoneyGram service and it will directly deposited into your account.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

Last I heard (in wiki) it was $180 USD. Where did u see this?<br /><br />AND, if bitcoins are so fucking easy to get, how come nobody will tell me how? all they wanna do is sell me some @high market value + a %.<br /><br />Here is what I read and tried:<br /><br />A Beginner&#039;s Guide to Buying Bitcoins<br />1) Configure Tor. (Optional)<br />If you wish your purchase to be as anonymous as possible, start by downloading the Tor Browser Bundle and opening the browser. The browser will not open until Tor is done connecting to the network, so please be patient. Doing everything through Tor will keep your IP address hidden.<br />2) Create an Instawallet.<br />Go to Instawallet.org. Bookmark the URL you&#039;re taken to, and copy to the Bitcoin payment address it gives you. (The bitcoin payment address is not the page URL.)<br />3) Create a disposable email address.<br />Go to Mailinator.com and create a random address. Log in to check its (empty) mail, then copy the &quot;alternate&quot; address it offers you at the top of the page to a text editor. You&#039;ll be using the alternate address later.<br />4) Set up a Bitinstant transfer.<br />Go to Bitinstant.com. From the first drop-down menu, select &quot;Cash Deposit - Walmart.&quot; From the second, select &quot;Bitcoin Address.&quot; Paste your Instawallet payment address in the &quot;Bitcoin Address&quot; textbox, your Mailinator alternate address into the &quot;Email address or mobile number&quot; textbox, and the amount of money you want to deposit (in USD) in the &quot;Amount to send&quot; textbox. (Be sure to take note of the commission rate before depositing.)<br />5) Select a location at which to make the deposit.<br />You will be forwarded to Zipzap.com. Do a search for the area in which you wish to make your deposit. Select a location from the list, then click &quot;Create Payment Slip&quot; at the bottom of the page. Zipzap will generate a downloadable PDF file, which you should print out. This process should not ask for your real name.<br />6) Get out of the house and make the deposit.<br />Go to the location you selected, taking the printed payment slip and enough cash to cover the transfer and the $3.95 Moneygram fee. Follow the instructions in the lower right-hand corner of the slip. You should not need your ID for any of this; however, some locations may ask for it. If you wish to keep your transaction completely anonymous, you may wish to leave your ID in your car, so that you can say that you forgot it, go back outside, and try another location. If there are others nearby, they&#039;ll be listed in the lower left-hand corner of the slip.<br />7) You&#039;re done!<br />Check your Instawallet URL. Your coins should be there soon. If they haven&#039;t arrived within six hours, you may wish to contact Bitinstant customer service. Have your transaction details ready, including your Instawallet bitcoin payment address.<br /><br />AFTER I enter info on bitinstant, it doesnt redirect me anyfucking where like everybody else says. i do the &quot;are you human&quot; test and hit send funds. I have heard it is supossed to generate a PDF . never seen it. <br /><br />If you or anyone else could PLEASE tell me whats happening or what Im doing wrong, i would be eternally grateful and probably send them some coin.

This higher fee will, I hope, make them consider the situation, the cost, and the realities of what they need to know before they can get into business. On top of that, it makes it more than three times harder for a scammer to scam up the funds for a new account. Hopefully this means a reduction in scammers, a reduction in shitbags, and a much happier site with more quality vendors.<br /><br />Oh, and shroomalicious... I&#039;m pretty sure it was done to lessen scams, but that&#039;s just my guess.

				@SHROOMalicious<br /><br /><br />Also shroom..there are much simpler and easier ways to get btc..<br /><br />In one post you say---<br /><br />AND, if bitcoins are so fucking easy to get, how come nobody will tell me how? all they wanna do is sell me some @high market value + a %.<br /><br /><br />Remember that you are ALWAYS buying btc off someone. there is ALWAYS a fee of some sort. Actually there are some vendors on here that sell btc with no fees at all!!! Again do your homework! This was not meant to be easy. BUT the easiest thing to do is acquire btc. There are at least 10 ways to get it. I do not know what you plan to vend...but your customers are in trouble!!haha<br /><br />So I will help you and tell you exactly how to get it..<br /><br />First that LONG list you have...delete it!! Huge pain in the ass. What you need is simplicity and quickness.<br /><br /><br />Go to wallgreens or almost any grocery store and buy a green dot money pack.&nbsp; Google it if you do not know what it is. Load it with $500.00. Depending on the deal it will cost you as little as free and as much as 5 bucks. Then get on Silk Road and message the vendor Sugar mama.She will tell you everything you need to know. I will give you the cliff notes here.<br /><br />You will then buy her free listing for BTC. You will scratch off the number on the back of the card and give it to her. She will then take a little while and will give you btc right into your SR account. Once it is in there you can transfer it to any SR account ...But it would be best if you had her transfer it into the account you are going to make a vendor account. Then you will send the btc to SR and you are then a vendor. This will take only a couple hours.<br /><br /><br />Then I would suggest you read, read,read,read,read. Then read some more.<br /><br /><br />Good luck!!

				If you&#039;re doing very much business $500 isn&#039;t too much and considering how much safer the SR can make dealing it&#039;s a good deal too.&nbsp; Plus it will help weed out people that aren&#039;t professional which aren&#039;t good for themselves or buyers.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with earlier post about the $500 making them consider the situation too.&nbsp;

				Pretty shitty how we&#039;ve had no warning or anything about this, maybe it&#039;s a mistake (but, probably not)<br /><br />DPR has been making plenty of money as the site it, it&#039;s either greed or its for actually trying to stop scamming, but the only thing that will stop scamming is actually making a review process type thing -<br /><br />Or by not letting vendors have access to their BTC unless they&#039;ve made like 30 successful transactions type thing, even then it will still be there - it&#039;ll always be there.<br /><br />It&#039;s DPR&#039;s site and it&#039;s up to them how they run it, but I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll be round to give us the scoop soon.

				And it is a community...but you still cant figure out btc..and you were saying so..so I was saying that you do not need your hand held..meaning you should not even need to message anyone..use the search option and search and read!!! Also this community is really sick and tired of answering people post about how to do this or that..You will get help but they are likely to say type it in search and read!!!<br /><br />You will see if you ever make it why that is. Also you are frustrated on just buying btc...and I know you still don&#039;t understand everything. I also said we have been there and we all know how you feel meaning..you need to figure it out on your own. And you need to search the forums as we did and you will see all the answers. And by doing so it will help you to understand everything a lot better then you asking and someone like me just giving you the answer.<br /><br />Also this community is awesome is most areas..but in a lot of ways they are protective and very secretive and so not like to help peopl do the simplest things..such as buying and selling btc. Where this forum excels is on the drug front ....meaning if you need to know about a drug or a drugs price or where to get it or anything like that..the forums are your place. But make sure you are in the right forum. Also you need to be careful how you ask. What you ask. And who you ask.<br /><br />Also you are trying to be a vendor. And that is not easy. And what everyone likes to do is let you be on your own and figure it out. you are actually lucky no vendors are addressing you. because you would get hammered. They expect you to come in and no A LOT. Not a little. N one will walk you through every step. And NO ONE will help you sell your coins once you make them. If you are going to be a vendor then it is best if you take up to 1 month to read and learn everything. Every single member will tell you that. In fact. I gave you the lowest number!!! Most will say 2,3 or even 5 months BEFORE YOU VEND.<br /><br />The community does not warm up easy to new vendors. And you will have a hand full of them tell you that you need to send them samples to get your businesses started. It is TOTAL bullshit. Don&#039;t give&nbsp; 1 person a free sample! there feedback does not mean shit! Hero member or not. What is important is you give deep discounts to BUYING members. There are a lot of forum members who have a lot to say but do not spend 1 dollar. And they are the first ones that yell samples.<br /><br /><br />Again when you are set up..offer 2 for 1 or something like 50% off to get real customers and real reviews. Giving away samples to forum members has never helped ONE vendor!!<br /><br /><br />Good luck

I understand the security surrounding SR, and respect it. I already know PGP/GPG. all that other stuff. I just dont see the thing about BTC. I know its there and people are adamant about it, but it seems they would make that the easiest thing to do so they get more sales. just saying.<br />And this isnt my first time in the game. been doing it for years.&nbsp; just that my shitty town lost ALL of its industry. absolutely nothing left here but pain pill addicts. if its nobody wants my product (which I am VERY good at) or if they do, they dont have $$$. Only reason I&#039;m still here is my parents, elderly and I help take care of them. I also know to give nothing away for free. twofers and extras are cool, as its builds trust and respect and a good customer base. I am really wanting to vend here as it seems safer and offers a way bigger customerbase. thought it would be a win-win.<br /><br />So once I get set up and fully know everything, if a noob comes in and asks for help with BTC and I help them, do I get shunned? L O L<br /><br />Once again , thanks for the info<br /><br />SAL

				OK a better way to put it is that the people who scam over and over on SR will buy accounts even at higher prices then most others.

The higher fee will make them stop and consider it more. The higher fee may result in less new vendors, less earned by SR from the fee, and if you&#039;re right about the scammers, more money not going into the scammer&#039;s pockets. I don&#039;t know about you, but I&#039;m happier with SR getting that then I am with the scammers.<br /><br />Perhaps, should a scammer get banned, their fee should be used to refund as many buyers as possible.

				The price for a sellers account is now indeed 500.00 dollars. IMHO its still too cheap. There are many reasons why the price was increased. I had to comment about why we didn&#039;t announce it. Could you imagine all the people buying up accounts at 150.00 and then reselling them at a profit? It would have defeated the purpose.<br /><br />99 percent of good vendors won&#039;t have an issue coming up with 500 bucks. Like I said, I think its still a very good deal, plus it will help secure SRM more.<br /><br /><br />~Flush

I have spent weeks here reading till my eyes bled. Yes money is tight, and I took all the advice I could find. I have purchased product, postage, equipment, and taken into account having to wait for finalization. My personal business plan was working up until now. I&#039;d say the extra $350 won&#039;t matter much to an established scammer, but to someone struggling to start new, pinching pennies and planning out the wazoo, this just threw me right out of the game. Now I&#039;m loaded down with product and packaging and no vendor account.<br />This sucks more than I can say. Even some warning would have been at least somewhat fair. And I don&#039;t need to hear about how life isn&#039;t always fair. I based my decisions on what was posted here, and I feel like I&#039;ve been whacked in the head with a 2x4. <br />With all the bickering in this thread I at least got one piece of useful info: Found out about BMR. I guess I&#039;ll have to sign with BMR for now and hope for the best. Since they only charge 1 BTC to sign up maybe that will make up for any some scamming, I don&#039;t know. But right now I have little choice.<br />What sucks most of all is that I had good feelings about SR and DPR and the whole setup. Now I&#039;m feeling bad karma.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

SR isn&#039;t dealing, it is selling. It is vending. It is in a whole different world from street-corner crack-deals. SR makes a world of difference in a world that needs a difference. Oh sure, I&#039;m sure the big supplies and big dealers were doing stuff like this for a long time...<br /><br />SR is the first time it was made available to the public... like, REALLY available. And safe, for both parties. No more cash, no more worry, no more hoping your supplier doesn&#039;t fuck you over... (Well, fred, you might have to deal with that and I wouldn&#039;t know, but most folks here won&#039;t.)<br /><br />And I agree with Flush and you, it still isn&#039;t high enough. It&#039;s a better barrier, a better wall... I personally wouldn&#039;t suggest a penny over a grand because anything more is fishing for big fish, of which there aren&#039;t many, and anything less is keeping the gates open for scammers, of which there are too many.

				It probably doesn&#039;t mean much coming from a buyer, but I appreciate the price increase. There is a huge problem with scammers on the site. It&#039;s really easy for someone to make a $150 vendor account, double their money, and start over again. That&#039;s if the account costs $150. A $500 account represents a bigger risk for a potential scammer. Now he has to make at least $500 from scamming just to make his money back. It&#039;s not worth it anymore, at least not for most people.<br /><br />And to mtljohn: Go fuck yourself. You&#039;re delusional if you think you&#039;ll be stealing Fred&#039;s customers any time soon. I&#039;m sick of you stirring shit all over the place around here.

				Only just now seeing this, and would&#039;ve likely offered a nudge towards &quot;reading&quot;, like everyone else, but also would have given pointers or shortcuts to info, or even the info itself if it could be typed quickly.&nbsp; BUT, with that being said, I&#039;m pretty certain it says right there on the site, $20 MINIMUM -- so pretty much all your issues have to do with reading, quit blaming others and take some responsibility.<br /><br />Haha, funny, CaptainMal posted pretty much same as me while I was writing, and the Captain is one of the finest people on here (notice all the ++++&#039;s) -- you&#039;ve even managed to stir his ire, which *rarely* happens -- you might be best served to just start a new forum account in a month or three after you&#039;ve done some study, lol.

				$500 is fair and something higher would be fine too. The value really is insane. Take a look at the Shroom guy melting down. He does not have the additional $350 needed but if he did he would potentially be able to make a lot of money. <br /><br />While the new price will restrict a lot of poor potential drug dealers that may have a positive impact on the community, it will also stop a lot of poor scammers. I think stopping scammers is more important personally.<br /><br />Congratulations to everyone who got in under the wire.

Now that paradise has exploded and become something bigger than DPR ever could have imagined, it makes sense that the cost to participate goes up. You can definitely still be a meaningful contribution to paradise, but you didn&#039;t help get us here, so pay up. No reason to complain, you&#039;re still getting an amazing deal that you won&#039;t find anywhere else.

				Seems fair. I have been considering making a sellers account for some time and this doesn&#039;t deter me one bit.<br />If you don&#039;t have the funds to buy a seller account , how would you expect to survive when X amount of money is held in escrow and the occasional scam buyer pops up or customs takes your shit?<br />I think sellers should be people who want to contribute to the community by providing their services no matter the cost, and not people who do this strictly for the money..

				To the shroom guy:&nbsp; You are acting like its our fault that your broke/ unintelligent ass couldnt figure out how to get bitcoins.&nbsp; I bet you a 12 year old could figure that shot out with google.&nbsp; And if you do come up with the chump change of $500 for a vendor account you will not last long and not make any money, it will just create headaches for you instead.&nbsp; How about you eat your shrooms instead.&nbsp; Im sure you will have alot more fun with that and save some of the newcomers heartache trying to make a purchase from you.

(Optional)<br />If you wish your purchase to be as anonymous as possible, start by downloading the Tor Browser Bundle and opening the browser. The browser will not open until Tor is done connecting to the network, so please be patient. Doing everything through Tor will keep your IP address hidden.<br />2) Create an Instawallet.<br />Go to Instawallet.org. Bookmark the URL you&#039;re taken to, and copy to the Bitcoin payment address it gives you. (The bitcoin payment address is not the page URL.)<br />3) Create a disposable email address.<br />Go to Mailinator.com and create a random address. Log in to check its (empty) mail, then copy the &quot;alternate&quot; address it offers you at the top of the page to a text editor. You&#039;ll be using the alternate address later.<br />4) Set up a Bitinstant transfer.<br />Go to Bitinstant.com. From the first drop-down menu, select &quot;Cash Deposit - Walmart.&quot; From the second, select &quot;Bitcoin Address.&quot; Paste your Instawallet payment address in the &quot;Bitcoin Address&quot; textbox, your Mailinator alternate address into the &quot;Email address or mobile number&quot; textbox, and the amount of money you want to deposit (in USD) in the &quot;Amount to send&quot; textbox. (Be sure to take note of the commission rate before depositing.)<br />5) Select a location at which to make the deposit.<br />You will be forwarded to Zipzap.com. Do a search for the area in which you wish to make your deposit. Select a location from the list, then click &quot;Create Payment Slip&quot; at the bottom of the page. Zipzap will generate a downloadable PDF file, which you should print out. This process should not ask for your real name.<br />6) Get out of the house and make the deposit.<br />Go to the location you selected, taking the printed payment slip and enough cash to cover the transfer and the $3.95 Moneygram fee. Follow the instructions in the lower right-hand corner of the slip. You should not need your ID for any of this; however, some locations may ask for it. If you wish to keep your transaction completely anonymous, you may wish to leave your ID in your car, so that you can say that you forgot it, go back outside, and try another location. If there are others nearby, they&#039;ll be listed in the lower left-hand corner of the slip.<br />7) You&#039;re done!<br />Check your Instawallet URL. Your coins should be there soon. If they haven&#039;t arrived within six hours, you may wish to contact Bitinstant customer service. Have your transaction details ready, including your Instawallet bitcoin payment address.<br /><br />AFTER I enter info on bitinstant, it doesnt redirect me anyfucking where like everybody else says. i do the &quot;are you human&quot; test and hit send funds. I have heard it is supossed to generate a PDF . never seen it. <br /><br />If you or anyone else could PLEASE tell me whats happening or what Im doing wrong, i would be eternally grateful and probably send them some coin.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>..<br /><br />We shouldn&#039;t have to hold your hand and tell you how! We all were where you are. Yes it seems frustrating..but truth is it is so simple. Also the journey in finding everything out is a good one for you. YOU are actually lucky as some very nice people have made post lately that tell you how to do everything. In GREAT detail. And 99% of us had to figure everything out on our own. This is not ebay. This is not for everyone. And if you are having a hard time buying btc now to fund your account....please tell me how you are going to turn the btc you make into USD????? Because that is 100x harder to do!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />/disagree.... this is a community, not of hand holders but of people helping people.&nbsp; <br /><br />Easiest way to get BTC on SR is through Sugar Mama, she will sell them to you for MP or Moneygram/Western Union and she&#039;s always done right by me, check her out.

				I noticed that the number of drug listings on SR went from 5000+ to 6000+ in the last week. That&#039;s a 20% increase in one week, which must mean a huge influx of new vendors. These are people with little experience in how to vend in this market, and little knowledge of the technology and the &quot;professional&quot; shipping expectations of this community. Since the $150 fee wasn&#039;t a deterrent to any idiot creating an account and trying to vend without knowing what he is doing, I can understand why it was raised. I can also understand why they wouldn&#039;t announce it, because of the black market in vendor accounts that would create.

				A compromise might be two levels of vendor account.<br /><br />Limited and Standard. <br /><br />Limited would be just that, limited to X amount of listings each with a max price of Y and a weekly transaction limit of Z, never allowed to ask for FE.

That way if you&#039;re not a scammer and you have a legitimate product to sell you can do it for a lower price. However, those vendors would be victims of reverse scammers. They could &quot;buy protection&quot; with the $500 tier, but then we&#039;re back to where we started, so might as well just have one tier.

				If your going to try and be a long term vendor here on silk road this new price is nothing, i think this will prevent scammers to think twice about getting an account. It certainly won&#039;t stop scamming, but it will help a little.

Remember, not all vendors have access to the Roundtable, only vendors with 35+ illicit transactions and 1 month + of membership, having linked their forum account to their vendor account and requesting access. Not every vendor is active on the forums, nor does every vendor who meets the stats for FE and access to the roundtable actually gain access to it.<br /><br />I have a lot of time and respect for nomad, and am not insinuating that he is confused or providing misinformation, but we cannot go on secondhand information here. It has to be from DPR him/herself, either in the Seller&#039;s Guide or in both the Seller&#039;s Guide and here on the forums.<br /><br />It is not currently against the guidelines as set out in the Seller&#039;s Guide, and enforcing such a rule without amending the terms contained within the Seller&#039;s Guide will result in vendors being reprimanded for something that does not break the rules that they agreed to; that is essentially a facet of fascism, and it is something that DPR would stand strongly against.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I always recommend that buyers do not FE, but as it currently stands vendors that do request it are not in breach of Silk Road rules once they meet FE requirements. That may very well change in the near future - and I hope that it does - but the rules, as of right now, make no mention of it.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

(Optional)<br />If you wish your purchase to be as anonymous as possible, start by downloading the Tor Browser Bundle and opening the browser. The browser will not open until Tor is done connecting to the network, so please be patient. Doing everything through Tor will keep your IP address hidden.<br />2) Create an Instawallet.<br />Go to Instawallet.org. Bookmark the URL you&#039;re taken to, and copy to the Bitcoin payment address it gives you. (The bitcoin payment address is not the page URL.)<br />3) Create a disposable email address.<br />Go to Mailinator.com and create a random address. Log in to check its (empty) mail, then copy the &quot;alternate&quot; address it offers you at the top of the page to a text editor. You&#039;ll be using the alternate address later.<br />4) Set up a Bitinstant transfer.<br />Go to Bitinstant.com. From the first drop-down menu, select &quot;Cash Deposit - Walmart.&quot; From the second, select &quot;Bitcoin Address.&quot; Paste your Instawallet payment address in the &quot;Bitcoin Address&quot; textbox, your Mailinator alternate address into the &quot;Email address or mobile number&quot; textbox, and the amount of money you want to deposit (in USD) in the &quot;Amount to send&quot; textbox. (Be sure to take note of the commission rate before depositing.)<br />5) Select a location at which to make the deposit.<br />You will be forwarded to Zipzap.com. Do a search for the area in which you wish to make your deposit. Select a location from the list, then click &quot;Create Payment Slip&quot; at the bottom of the page. Zipzap will generate a downloadable PDF file, which you should print out. This process should not ask for your real name.<br />6) Get out of the house and make the deposit.<br />Go to the location you selected, taking the printed payment slip and enough cash to cover the transfer and the $3.95 Moneygram fee. Follow the instructions in the lower right-hand corner of the slip. You should not need your ID for any of this; however, some locations may ask for it. If you wish to keep your transaction completely anonymous, you may wish to leave your ID in your car, so that you can say that you forgot it, go back outside, and try another location. If there are others nearby, they&#039;ll be listed in the lower left-hand corner of the slip.<br />7) You&#039;re done!<br />Check your Instawallet URL. Your coins should be there soon. If they haven&#039;t arrived within six hours, you may wish to contact Bitinstant customer service. Have your transaction details ready, including your Instawallet bitcoin payment address.<br /><br />AFTER I enter info on bitinstant, it doesnt redirect me anyfucking where like everybody else says. i do the &quot;are you human&quot; test and hit send funds. I have heard it is supossed to generate a PDF . never seen it. <br /><br />If you or anyone else could PLEASE tell me whats happening or what Im doing wrong, i would be eternally grateful and probably send them some coin.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The unquestionably cheapest way would be to do this:<br /><br />1) Open a Dwolla account<br />2) Open a Campbx account<br />3) Link your bank account to Dwolla<br />4) Transfer funds from bank account to Dwolla<br />5) Transfer funds from Dwolla to Campbx<br />6) Convert USD to Bitcoins in Campbx<br />7) Transfer bitcoins from Campbx to SR<br /><br />Dwolla charges a $.25 (25 cent) fee for transferring funds to Campbx but that will be the only fee you encounter, except for exchange rate losses from bid/ask spread. So this is not the fastest way (after all account are set up it takes about 3 days to transfer funds from bank account to dwolla and maybe an hour after that to eventually get it to SR), but only do this if you are comfortable linking your bank account to Dwolla and providing some personal information.

Not every vendor is active on the forums, nor does every vendor who meets the stats for FE and access to the roundtable actually gain access to it.<br /><br />I have a lot of time and respect for nomad, and am not insinuating that he is confused or providing misinformation, but we cannot go on secondhand information here. It has to be from DPR him/herself, either in the Seller&#039;s Guide or in both the Seller&#039;s Guide and here on the forums.<br /><br />It is not currently against the guidelines as set out in the Seller&#039;s Guide, and enforcing such a rule without amending the terms contained within the Seller&#039;s Guide will result in vendors being reprimanded for something that does not break the rules that they agreed to; that is essentially a facet of fascism, and it is something that DPR would stand strongly against.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I always recommend that buyers do not FE, but as it currently stands vendors that do request it are not in breach of Silk Road rules once they meet FE requirements. That may very well change in the near future - and I hope that it does - but the rules, as of right now, make no mention of it.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed, I found it curious that it was not made into an official policy when the thread was closed. Also the thread was stickied, then unstickied but it was very useful info that would serve the community at large. Makes you wonder...

				500$ it&#039;s like £310 - still not so bad. Of course I&#039;m glad I paid around £120 couple moths ago, but £310 wouldn&#039;t scared me at all. It&#039;s a one week of brainwashing work in a cheese factory, then another week to get funds for some stuff, and then &quot;breaking bad&quot; et voilà.<br />I remember I came here to sell my private stuff (a mean medicines), so I&#039;m just a bacteria here. For someone who wants to sell cocaine, speed and tons of other things it&#039;s still a bargain.

				I was also considering getting a vendor account..$500 is high but not a deal breaker, but still waiting for connection issues to cease. I still can&#039;t get on here half the time. Wondering how people fulfill dozens of orders a day?<br /><br />-mm
