				I&#039;ve been an on the forums here for a while and met great people along the way, so i decided to try my efforts here. In late July, my dad was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer. A tumor was removed and lots of tests were done. As a result, the bills are stacking as he is undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. My father is a independent businessman who has run a 29 year old mechanics shop and has 3 kids including myself. He works 70 hours a week, 6 days a week and is still working as he gets weaker. He was just barely getting by before this and now he has over $80,000 in medical bills over the course of 3 months. Our mom passed in October last year from cancer and this has been too much too soon for everyone involved. It&#039;s really hard at the moment but I believe if my dad can get help at all with these bills he will have a huge weight off his shoulders and be motivated to beat this disease. Please help my dad. He has worked too hard to have this pressing down on him at the age of retirement. Thank you and god bless.<br /><br />Donate address: 1P29qmtu9FgQ895cHcmjyKzwUhwRqQkG92

				Well it sounds like the cancer is a God send!!! Working 70 hours, 6 days a week is a miserable life. Then losing his dear wife just over a year ago is really tough I am sure. I am sure he just wants to go join her but he does not want to be selfish and kill himself and leave you 3 kids behind with out either parent. So he probably prayed for this to happen and&nbsp; I believe that pancreatic cancer is pretty painless and almost always&nbsp; fatal. So he should go to join his wife peacefully.<br /><br />Just keep racking up the medical bills!! When he passes so do his bills..so there is no worries there! In fact, you should try and get him instant credit at all the department stores....take him shopping and when they ask &quot;would you like to sign up for a card and get 10% off&quot;...say &quot;YES&quot; Just do not tell them he has terminal cancer. Also,make sure to keep the tags on his stuff so you can return it and get a cash refund. Your lucky, this is the perfect time&nbsp; of&nbsp; the year as you can get gift receipts so that you can return all the items for cash even though he used credit to make the purchases. So your luck is turning around!!!(you have to look at the positive whenever you can...this is a difficult time for you)<br /><br />It is a lot easier to lose the second parent after the first. As this is supposed to happen. Every kid should see their parents die...just not sure they should see them go through chemo, lose all their hair, finally get skinny, turn grey(skin not hair) and shit themselves. Oh well, look on the bright side, it could be worse. you could be black. It&#039;s when the parents see their children die... that is when it is totally fucked! So again...your luck is turning around.<br /><br />Also with Obama care kicking in...if your dad happens to be a fighter and stick around (unlike your mother) then you are set as far as insurance and bills go! <br /><br />&nbsp;TURKEY!!!!!!<br /><br />That&#039;s three in a row!!! (Good things.... that have happened to you since the tragedy)<br /><br />So if he is not going to quit like your mother did...tell him not to worry about the bills!!! With Obama care you are G O L D E N!!!!<br /><br />Sorry to hear about all this tragedy you and your family has been going through in the past year..... I feel your pain, my parents just got bumped out of First Class on their way to Hawaii for their 50th Anniversary. So if your Dad toughens it out (unlike your mom) and makes it to January when Obama Care kicks in you will be able to throw him in a home. So be patient.<br /><br />&nbsp;SR members have been through hell this last week...we are a big&nbsp; family and I was able to take the time to write you this encouragement and tell you the facts. That is hard to get.<br /><br />Keep us updated!!!<br /><br />

				Sorry to hear about your father. You should check into phoenix tears (a type of cannabis oil). It has caused many miraculous cancer cures and can be made by anyone pretty easily. <br /><br />mm
