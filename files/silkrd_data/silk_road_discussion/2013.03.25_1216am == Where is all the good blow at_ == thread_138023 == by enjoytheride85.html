				Would anyone care t0 say who they have used for coke? I&#039;m looking for the best quality for a reasonable price. I refuse to buy from Nod because his prices are just plain greedy.

				Have you ever tried Nod&#039;s product? It&#039;s better than anything I&#039;ve ever tried. I need to use much less than normal so his stuff lasts me longer and is actually more cost-effective. There&#039;s a reason it&#039;s so popular even with the price.

				This is what the Rumor Mill is for.

				I have done a lot of searching, and have definitely browsed through that 500 page post.. but it is always off topic. Was just curious to see who people were using and how it worked out. Not trying to clog up the discussion board. Thanks for the tips.&nbsp; <br /><br />And no, I haven&#039;t tried Nods product, I can&#039;t justify laying down that kind of cash. I have had amazing blow before and i know how it can be.. I&#039;m just hoping there is another vendor out there that has a good product also (for less than 480$ a ball --- just crazy..)

				Nod is your man. I&#039;ve just placed my second order with him, and barring it turning out shitty, I&#039;ll never look elsewhere! I was shocked at his blow prices, but then I ordered his 1g BTH with the free half gram coke so I could see what all the fuss was about. 1/2 gram of Nod&#039;s coke did for me and my wife what a teener of local coke does, so it is WAY more cost effective for us to be ordering Nod&#039;s coke than the local stuff. I will grant you that he is the only SR vendor I&#039;ve tried yet for coke, though I recently placed an order with Astonmarteen as well, we&#039;ll see how that one goes!

				I am about to order from NOD. If you have ever done pure raw before, you will realize that most of the street product is stomped&nbsp; into oblivion. Honestly would rather pay more for the top shelf then snort schwag. Seriously who smokes that Mexican dirt anymore when you can get the finest.
