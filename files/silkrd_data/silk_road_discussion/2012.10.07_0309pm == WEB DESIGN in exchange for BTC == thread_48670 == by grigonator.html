				Hey Guys, <br /><br />As a new member of this forum (been lurking around here for a while) I&#039;m assuming this is the best place to post this thread, and also I was not able to immediately find any other threads with a similar topic - so here goes my idea/question.<br /><br />SWIM (should i even use &quot;SWIM&quot;?) was about to buy some bitcoins until i realized it&#039;s not exactly easy to make them untraceable. Instead of going out of my way and using a service like localbitcoins.com to buy some, i thought - Wouldn&#039;t it be possible to offer some services on either SR or this forum in return for some bitcoints in total anonymity?<br /><br />I&#039;m officially offering web design services (I&#039;m a skilled programmer and web designer) in exchange for BTC. All completed work can be sent over TOR/GPG mail and no identifying information needs to be given it (IE you can modify a wordpress website with whatever personal details you need after you receive it from me)<br /><br />Any takers?

				Let me first point out that if you are looking to buy from SR then it is not as important that the bitcoin be anonymised. SR has a built in tumbler that means that what you buy is not linked to the coins you put into SR.<br /><br />What does SWIM mean?<br /><br />You will need an SR account ($150) if you want to sell your service so you will need bitcoin to get started.<br />

				Cheers!<br /><br />This makes a lot more sense now. SWIM stands for someone-who-isn&#039;t-me.

				You don&#039;t need to use SWIM here.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t provide any legal protection anyway, every cop knows what it means. <br /><br />Side note, but I can&#039;t be the only one who is annoyed when people drug forums talk about their &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;pet goldfish&quot;.

				That&#039;s a good point actually. If I was an LEO, I could, say, insert an HTML comment in to your code and then look for a website that pops up with that in tact, whois lookup and bam. Alternatively, if the site had any unique images, I could use google image search (the one where you upload an image to search with) to find what site on the net has similar/identical looking images, again, WHOIS it and boom - onion and clearnet identity linked, big security risk.<br /><br />I guess that means I&#039;ll have to do work soley for darknet/onion net.
