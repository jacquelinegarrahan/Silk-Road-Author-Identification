				Hello sr,<br /><br />I ordered a couple of items last week and they did not come now when I told the vendor at first he was really helpful promising to resend but now he has just vanished and is not responding to my messages and his history shows he has been active every day but still no reply, I am getting a little worried now what should I do I cant help but think I have been scammed even though the guy has 100% feedback and over a 100 transactions is it possible for vendors to get fake feed back and transaction history&nbsp; ?

				I&#039;ve been a buyer since last April, and this past month has been the WORST as far as shipping times.&nbsp; What I&#039;ve learned is, under a week is a miracle, even during non-holiday jams. <br /><br />Unless it&#039;s domestic priority or something. Give at least 2 weeks before you get too excited. <br /><br />Especially with the 100% rating. 100 transactions etc.<br /><br />Hang in there. It&#039;s Monday, new week. 1st full week after the Holidays. 1st full mailing week. <br /><br />I hope and pray that&#039;s all it is.&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; &nbsp;FYI I have 3 orders outsdanding. 1 from a trusted seller, approaching the 30 day mark. 1 over the 2 week mark, and one approaching 2 weeks. All from Europe. <br /><br />In feedback on the latest one ( dagobert ) I notice people are saying &quot;took very long time, but all is well&quot; etc. So keep the faith. <br /><br />Always take the vendors name and do a search here on forums. Also look in the thread for that particular product, ie; Speed/Amphetamine , Benzo thread, etc. <br /><br />Hang in there, please return to let us know you received it, when you do. (see the faith there?&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; )

				yes mate vendors can get fake feedback and transaction history all they have to do is open a buyers account with a different name and buy there own stuff so every sale is perfect and so are the reviews only way to really no is to hit up the vendor review treads on here to check if they are legit ;)

				haha thanks for the reassurance man, I think hes cool its just I had to go out and buy some street smoke because package was late so now I am out of pocket too, as long as it gets here thats all that matters the guy just needs to reply vendors could save themselves a lot of trouble by just replying last I heard from him was sat morning, dont know what the next step is if hes resending or if I should wait its been since tues last week sent out first class and he said others got their packages in 2 days so we will see, it should be fine, yeah I will report back hopefully with some good news.

				Doesn&#039;t hurt to tell us the vendor name. You&#039;re not calling them a scammer right off the bat. <br /><br />You just want re-assurance. Yes they can make their own purchases. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if some do on a regular basis, just because of competition. <br /><br />Go up to the search bar NOW.&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; type in the vendor name, and read about them.&nbsp; Sometimes it takes a few searches. - Like adding an &quot;s&quot; to the end. I found that helps.<br /><br />People usually refer to the vendor typing an &quot;s&quot; like Blobbys speed or Blobby&#039;s speed. if you don&#039;t search with the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;&#039;s&quot;&nbsp; (apostrophe s) , you won&#039;t always find all the comments that exist.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />peace<br /><br />Jagfug
