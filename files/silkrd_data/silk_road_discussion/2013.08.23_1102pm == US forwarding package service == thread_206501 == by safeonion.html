				Greetings.<br /><br />I have found some websites, www.myus.com, www.shipto.com, &amp; www.viaaddress.com.<br /><br />But i have readed all kind of bad reviews about those websites, and some good ones to also, but i dont trust them enough to ship my package throw them, so my question is, does anyone here know anything about those websites, or have experience with another website? - if so please link.<br /><br />as always +1 karma to those nice people out there.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />

				Safeonion, good question. I also got mixed results when trying to find a service. You are looking for a place to send your order who would then send it to you, right? Almost like tumbling your mail? The biggest worry I have is the way LE and NSA are behaving in the US going after things under the cloak of terrorism they could just raid the place and take and copy their records. It would be great if they didnt keep records but any business is going to keep records for at least a few days to handle any customer complaints and prove they shipped. Even if they destroyed them once your order was delivered we would still have to run the risk that something could happen while we had an open order with them. I find it really scary how widely the nsa has captured all sort of data with no reasonable purpose and even more terrifying is the lack of outrage in the us. Last week they said what they had mistakenly grabbed peoples emails but only a few hundred thousand so no need to worry! WHAT?!? Americans should be outraged and some are but not as many as should be. Thanks for the topic though Im going to keep an eye on it. <br />+1 for raising it :)

Thanks for the topic though Im going to keep an eye on it.<br />+1 for raising it :)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First off we have to be clear on the circumstances. If a package from the Netherlands is ordered to a Mail Forwarder in the US and it gets seized by Customs, how would this scenario differ compared to if it had been sent straight to the home address to begin with? What happens if the Mail Forwarder has been registered with a Fake Identity as there can obviously not be any raid then? The point of how long they&#039;re storing the data is crucial, and luckily each individual company has their own set of data. The smartest way of doing this as I see it is using two separate Mail Forwarders who reside in separate Federal States, so the only way of them getting any information would be to advance the case to a Federal Case, which I seriously doubt they would do for very small amounts. Now I can already see someone trying to argue they might elevate it to a Federal Case on the basis alone that a Fake Identity has been used, but how would they proof the same person who got sent the Product is the one Registering that Account?<br /><br />Let&#039;s consider a hypothetical scenario ( yes this is sort of advertising for Oneiros Distribution :P ) :<br /><br />My secondary Vending Account Oneiros Distribution orders 5 grams of MDMA from Vendor X from Canada. It arrives safely at the first Mail Forwarder after a couple of days in the United States in Florida, I then ship the package to a secondary Mail Forwarder in let&#039;s say California. I create a listing on the Vendor Account saying I have 5 gram of MDMA ready to ship from California. A buyer orders and receives 5 grams of MDMA in 2-3 days without any risk for a Customs Seizure.<br /><br />The amount of work Law Enforcement would have to spend on seizing this order alone is massive, essentially probing two separate companies ( in different Federal States! ) just to get one single order. Sure it could be done but how realistic is this scenario? How realistic would it even be for them to do this with one Mail Forwarder involved? I&#039;ve spent considerable time researching this subject and I&#039;m betting they do not have the resources to control this newly emerging market, we will see if I&#039;ve been right or wrong at a later date.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />PS. I will post Descriptions on specific Mail Forwarders and Virtual Office Providers in my thread [Intel] Mail Forwarding and Virtual Office Providers - Concept and Thoughts: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=183216

				The mail forwarder could provide plausible deniability if it&#039;s a fake id without your picture.<br />If the seize the package in customs this might be easier to set you up with a mail forwarder, because they could hold it there and try to call the owner of the account as opposed to a po box which you could check randomly.

				I dont know about that, you are adding extra hops for mail to be inspected and extra breadcrumbs for LEO to investigate and collect. Whats the point.
