				Thanks for coming back and quelling some of the irrational fear about those &quot;missing&quot; deposits. Granted, I would have been concerned too if I had a deposit floating out there in the ether, but to do what some people did and jump to the conclusion that a scam was afoot, without even giving DPR &amp; Crew a chance to work through the affected transactions? A lotta drama for nothing. ;)
