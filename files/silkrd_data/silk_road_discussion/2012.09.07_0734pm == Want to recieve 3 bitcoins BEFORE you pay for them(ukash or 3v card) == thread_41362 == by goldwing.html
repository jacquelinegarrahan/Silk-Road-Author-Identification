				Hi<br /><br />well Im trying to sell Bitcoins for ukash,however as I&#039;m new too nobody has tried to buy any off of me(Ive only made a few posts too),as theyve no reason to trust me<br /><br />so I&#039;m offering to send a few coins first,rather than a customer send me the payment and hope I dont scam them<br /><br />il aim to try have people paid within an hour or two<br /><br />if you want coins off of me you can get a ukash voucher or a 3v voucher,you can change the denomination to start at something cheap like 10 euro or something<br /><br />thanks

All sales and exchanges must take place through a Silk Road vendor account.

This would be a bad idea for the vendor as he will most likely be scammed.<br /><br />This also applies to products. A vendor only has to scam $150 to cover the cost of their vendor account, and anything above that is pure profit.<br /><br />Having said that, there is no proof that goldwing intends on doing any such thing. I can only advise people that wish to use his service should he purchase a vendor&#039;s account to do so with very small amounts.<br /><br />I would always recommend that members source their Bitcoin from reputable Bitcoin sellers / exchanges outside of Silk Road, if at all possible.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br /><br />(Good to see another Irish user on here by the way!)
