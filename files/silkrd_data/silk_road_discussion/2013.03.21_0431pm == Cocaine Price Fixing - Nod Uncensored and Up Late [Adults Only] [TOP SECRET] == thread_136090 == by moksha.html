				Nod with the bitchin tar:<br /><br />« on: March 04, 2013, 01:14 am »<br />In my experience we as vendors are pretty competitive.<br /><br />I think this is a bad thing, when we compete all we can do is take one<br />another&#039;s business and drive prices down.<br /><br />I have been in talks with vendors who contact me looking for ways to<br />cooperate. There&#039;s a ton more money to be made cooperating than by<br />competing.&nbsp; &nbsp; Any vendor who is interested in working with me to increase<br />both of our profits please message me on sr (not on the forums - I dont<br />check forum mail often)<br /><br />Here are some thoughts on what I offer:<br /><br />&nbsp; a) I run my shop as a business, separating the areas, and working<br />costing on each. I have created models to understand costs and profits<br />and as a result my profits are very high.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to brag so I<br />won&#039;t throw out any solid numbers, but for example I keep track of<br />visible finalizes of many competing vendors to calculate their visible<br />revenue.&nbsp; I am turning more revenue than both SupremeSmoke and<br />Undergroudn syndicate (both top 1% vendors, I am top 3%) and my<br />calculations show I am at 3.5x their profit.&nbsp; &nbsp; The numbers could be off<br />maybe 20% because of variables that I&#039;ve estimated wrong but my point<br />here is we not selling drugs, we are running businesses and so business<br />analytics are the key to making money.&nbsp; I offer these services in trade<br />for help from others.<br /><br />&nbsp; b) Product sharing: Rather than compete with another vendor on product,<br />we can compare who&#039;s is better/most consistent/best price and then both<br />people use the better vendor&#039;s gear.&nbsp; &nbsp; Regardless of who&#039;s is better<br />both people win.&nbsp; For example if a BTH vendor wants to buy my gear I<br />make money selling it to him and then he makes money because he can<br />raise his price up due to branding.&nbsp; In the reverse case, if another BTH<br />vendor had better product than me (in fantasy land ;P) I would buy his<br />at a profit to him and then my product line would improve.<br /><br />&nbsp; c)&nbsp; Coke is a serious business. I am also serious about coke, it&#039;s my<br />drug of choice so I&#039;ve worked up some very good connections.&nbsp; I have<br />quite a lot of coke here which is 85% as good as my current premium<br />coke.&nbsp; This coke was selling at $469/3.5gm and my profit on this product<br />alone was 20k/month.&nbsp; I no longer want to sell this product as I have<br />better but I would be willing to sell my supply to another vendor.&nbsp; I<br />have a large amount of supply which is within the top 5 on SR that I<br />would like to get rid of, I could sell this in bulk 1oz at a time to<br />another vendor who doesn&#039;t have a good connection so he could to enter<br />the coke market.<br /><br />&nbsp;d) This business has many components.&nbsp; There&#039;s the vendor, which is<br />advertising.&nbsp; There&#039;s shipping.&nbsp; There&#039;s cash out, customer service<br />(messages), and analytics.&nbsp; These pieces do not need to be linked.&nbsp; The<br />most obvious part is shipping:&nbsp; If two vendors each have oen product the<br />other does not they could both market separately and then the opposite<br />vendor would ship if trust was sufficient.&nbsp; As each vendor would gain an<br />equal slice of the pie both would win overall.<br /><br />e) price fixing.&nbsp; Just because we are selling the same product does not<br />mean we have to compete. We can use that to build each other&#039;s rep and<br />then raise prices.&nbsp; I get a lot of flak for having the 1gm heroin listing<br />at $285.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even had vendors get mad at me.&nbsp; That&#039; rediculous, me<br />having a high price improves their sales, all vendors have gained as a<br />result, vendors should be thanking me for improving their profits not<br />getting upset.&nbsp; &nbsp; What if I took flak in one market for being the high<br />priced gouger and you made more money sitting right below me in that<br />market, then similarly you take some flak for being high priced in another<br />market and I rake in good profits by sitting my price below yours.&nbsp; We<br />would both win!&nbsp; &nbsp;I know googleyed understands this, but I don&#039;t think<br />many vendors do.&nbsp; SubsandAddy bitched me out for it once.&nbsp; Made me wonder<br />if he even realized that he benefits from the market being raised.<br /><br />f) I&#039;ve put a good deal of effort in to lowering expenses, this has raised<br />my profit from 5% to 35% and showed me which products to cut.&nbsp; I can share<br />this knowledge with a partner.<br /><br />g) I can help you with cheap cash out, I&#039;m at 5% currently at a time<br />investment of 1hr per 20k with total anonymity.<br /><br />h) branding!&nbsp; &nbsp;Image and perception are huge, I can help with this or<br />bring in a third party who can do it for a fee.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anybody interested in those?&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to share if we can offer<br />something so I win too.&nbsp; Any ideas on how you can help me?&nbsp; Shoot them on<br />over!&nbsp; Meanwhile, here are some things I could use:<br /><br />a) I need leads on high quality #3 or #4?&nbsp; I would pay a premium for un<br />cut. 65% minimum, 80% preferred.&nbsp; I would be open to either paying you a<br />finder&#039;s fee after the 2nd shipment, or purchasing it through you as you<br />purchase from him.&nbsp; I have done both before from other vendors.<br />b) Can you get (or can you sell me a lead on) suboxone or subutex in large<br />volume? (300/mo minimum)<br /><br />Let&#039;s help each other get rich!

				if its true, then it just shows what a greedy bastard he is !<br />making a profit is one thing, wouldn&#039;t expect him to sell drugs without making money as thats what selling drugs is about, making money.<br />But he is saying he makes $20,000 a month on coke alone, then talks about which drugs to cut and he still isnt happy with the amount of money he is making !!!!!!!!!<br />his idea will never work anyway so i wouldnt worry about it.

				Well technically buyers joining hands to boycott wouldn&#039;t be a cartel. And it wouldn&#039;t work because due the nature of drugs, you are not factoring the fiending/craving/addictions etc.<br />The vendor cartels can sit on a high price. A group of buyers might attempt a boycott, but you&#039;d better believe that someone in that group will give in and place an order (even at the price they&#039;re boycotting)for reasons that will trump their principled stance.. you know?

				I&#039;m not sure this thread is a joke. Maybe it is but I&#039;m completely missing the punch-line. I think we all got a front row seat to an on-line mob boss proposal of sorts as moksha&#039;s proposal is precisely the way price fixing and back-room dealing happens. It&#039;s what I expect from politicians and corporation heads but with drugs as the commodity instead. <br /><br />If successful, the consumer gets screwed out of a fair market shake - but here&#039;s the rub - it won&#039;t succeed. Ya wanna know why? It may work for a month or two, but all it takes in ONE dealer to hit hard times and realize that by undercutting the other dealers (who he has no real-life connection to and therefore NO consequences in breaking his word), he will make a lot of money right away at their expense. Idiots. OR new dealers will enter the marketplace with absolutely no allegiance to this boys club. <br /><br />Gotta love the freest of free markets. Good luck moksha&nbsp;

				A cartel won&#039;t work on the road. Nod has some really good cocaine at the moment which is why he&#039;s getting away with his ridiculous prices. I&#039;d even go so far as to say he has the best among the US domestic vendors right now, why the fuck would they raise their prices when their only advantage over Nod at the moment is pricing? It would only be Nod who benefits from this.

				Coke&nbsp; from Canada usa and EU is a deal IMO, if Canadian street coke its about 20-30% purity and costs about $60-80&nbsp; gram on sr you can get stuff of the lavada from vendors like rob who is no longer active your really paying about 65% less. The only thing thats really bad about SR coke is the bulk prices. Most vendors have way to high bulk coke prices so people dont resell their stuff and take their game.

				Last post is well said.&nbsp; <br /><br />I stopped buying coke here.&nbsp; My last three orders from different vendors were cut to shit.&nbsp; You can&#039;t tell high heat from medium in Canada coke vendors .&nbsp; <br /><br />I would be ashamed to sell that garbage in real life.&nbsp; If it was possible to get reasonable bulk in the first place here.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope American coke is better.&nbsp; $130. Or higher for cut all over the spoon and clogged syringes is not cool. Especially after several repeat orders and promises from the coke vendors . <br /><br />Canada prices go down but the quality takes a nose dive.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck I even offered to pay extra for the vendor to leave it alone for me, cause I like to shoot it.&nbsp; Not a chance&nbsp; still sludgey with shit floating around.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to get your quality coke and spill it on to Canada domestic.&nbsp; $!<br /><br />

				It has been mentioned elsewhere, but a cartel in a free market is impossible. A cartel can only be enforced with government power.<br /><br />Here is Murray Rothbard on &#039;The Myth of the Free Market Cartel&#039;. Five minutes of your life to learn why a cartel of this type will NEVER work.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Opvlmy8i8

				The fact that nod4less was able to sell small increments at a cheaper price really shows the margins nod is making.&nbsp; As consumers in a free market we speak with our money and if the prices are too high, silence shall be imposed.
