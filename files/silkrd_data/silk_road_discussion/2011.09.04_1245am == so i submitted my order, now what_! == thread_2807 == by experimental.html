				when i click&nbsp; on ORDERS i see under status: processing and beside it the word cancel.&nbsp; But when I move my mouse over the word cancel I get a caption that says: this option will be available in X days.&nbsp; Say if the seller sends it before the countdown to canceling is finished.&nbsp; Is there a minimum four day waiting period for transactions to go through?&nbsp; Also when buying something shouldn&#039;t the seller send back a message telling u that they received the bitcoin and give u a tracking number??

				I will assume that you have read through all the sellers profile and item description and instructions.&nbsp; If not, do so now.<br /><br />All you have done to this point is place the order.&nbsp; The next step is up to the seller.&nbsp; They will see that they have a new order and may do several things.<br /><br />They may PM you telling you they have the order and will place the order &#039;In Transit&#039; when they have physically mailed the package.&nbsp; They may simply get the order ready and then place it in transit.&nbsp; Or, they may cancel it for whatever reason they have, and PM you about it (or they may not).<br /><br />Once they place the order &#039;In Transit&#039;, you sit back and wait for your package to arrive.&nbsp; When it arrives you go back to your order screen and click on &#039;Finalize&#039; to release the money to the seller and rate the product.<br /><br />After so many days of sitting &#039;In Transit&#039;&nbsp; the &#039;resolve&#039; option will appear.&nbsp; You may click on the resolve option to request a refund because the product hasn&#039;t arrived or you may extend the total number of days until the order auto-resolves (the seller gets paid automatically).<br /><br />If you have not read the sellers instructions, and they have indicated that you must release the funds early (clicking on finalize BEFORE you get the goods), then the seller will either PM you requesting that you do, or they will simply cancel the order.<br /><br />So, basically, you just need to wait for the seller to acknowledge your order and place it in transit, then wait for the package to arrive.<br /><br />I suggest you go back to the main page and read through the Buyers Guide again, to refresh your memory regarding how SR works.&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

				Then play the waiting game, my friend. Patience is a virtue in this place unless you have the cash for express shipping :P
