				Earlier today on SR there was a guy posting all over the place offering Counterfit $$ for 8 bitcoins.&nbsp; Was posted **everywhere** <br /><br />Might be related to that?&nbsp; Someone contacted him and he insisted FE.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seems like a great way to run off with a bunch of coins :(<br /><br />

				thanks for the replies. I am pretty objective, so I wouldn&#039;t do stupid shit like FE or buy into a fake promise.<br /><br />However, I am uneasy (as I&#039;m sure everyone is) about the site being down, and DPR&#039;s comment about something not smelling right. I wish I had waited until Monday to xfer $ into SR, for no other reason than not having to worry right now. But-Patience.. I gots it.

				Any sale or event should be fine to participate in as long as the risk reduction measures that are followed AS STANDARD continue to be followed.<br /><br />Which is what didn&#039;t happen last year with Tony76. Massive massive sale of stock, asking everyone to FE in order to keep the volume of orders moving swiftly.<br /><br />Then he fucked off with the cash.<br /><br />As the guy who just left the chat room&#039;s moniker says: &quot;No_Fe_Ever&quot;.<br /><br />And, even as a vendor, I kinda agree. Doesn&#039;t matter what the &quot;potential&quot; of an opportunity is. If it doesn&#039;t match my risk profile (ie, requires FE, shady meetups or telephone calls), that opportunity simply doesn&#039;t even exist in my head.<br /><br />If I receive an order that I cannot fulfill, whether that is because of stock issues, quality issues, risk issues or even just my fucking spidey senses going mental, I will back out with deepest apologies.<br /><br />I want all our clients to have a positive experience. So far, so good.<br /><br />With that in mind, I&#039;m kicking our 420 event off now.<br /><br />1st up - Upto 15% off all current stock, which includes our stupid strength, stupidly good value bong mix, the brain meltingly relaxing Etizolam and a lighting contactor for all your wannabe growers.<br /><br />Currently everything is UK to UK only. I will be revising this later today when I update our stock listings.<br /><br />2nd up - ????? I &quot;deem&quot; it will be coming soon.... ;-)<br /><br />3rd up - LOL... You&#039;ll love it. :-)<br /><br /><br />Anyway, tangent off. The moral of the story is always do your due diligence, especially when prices are just too good to be true and the seller is forcing people away from using safeguards.<br /><br />Think about it. Have you ever been invited to a deal in the back of an alley, on your own, for an offer that is apparently too good to be true? And you get there, look ahead and you know this shit aint gonna end well. You can feel it.<br /><br />You have one chance at this point to walk away, for whatever reason. If feels like you might lose face, or lose out, so your brain tries to convince you of one thing whilst your heart another.<br /><br />This exact same dynamic plays out, in microcosm, in every trade where it is demanded that early finalization is required.<br /><br />So yeah, anyway.<br /><br />No FE. <br /><br />And fucking HAPPY 420 EVERYONE! :-D
