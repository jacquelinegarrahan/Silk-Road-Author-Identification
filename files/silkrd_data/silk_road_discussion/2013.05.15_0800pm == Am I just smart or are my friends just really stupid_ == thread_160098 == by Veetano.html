				I&#039;ve been using SR for over a year+, and never told any of my friends about it. I get a lot of stuff on the road, and sell to them, and have been for the last 2 years.<br /><br />Today I had a talk with them about acid and RC&#039;s, and someone brought up SR saying everyone they know uses it, and that it&#039;s sketchy and filled with bad acid and other RC&#039;s, and that it&#039;s not even worth using....Apparently they&#039;ve all used it at one point, and gotten bad acid or something.<br /><br />Why do they all have this consensus? Are they just stupid? Do they simply not research? Obviously I have no interest in bringing this up to them as I don&#039;t want them to use SR for my own personal reasons, but where do they get these ideas from?<br /><br />SR is incredibly safe as far as I am concerned, though I use a lot of encryption, thoroughly investigate and research any vendor I do business with, and conversate with them heavily before purchasing anything. I can see how one bad transaction, or the idea of getting drugs through the mail can throw people off... but I think it&#039;s safer than people convince themselves it is.<br /><br />I know a number of traffickers not on SR doing 10-20lbs+ through the USPS on a regular basis who have never had any issues what so ever.... they just only ship domestically and make sure their packaging isn&#039;t fucking retarded.<br /><br />What do you guys think. Are my friends just stupid? Is the average person just stupid, and it&#039;s good that only people of a certain intelligence can safely use SR? I&#039;ve always had a good head on my shoulders, but I just want to understand what might be going through my friends heads to make them think these things.

				This is an interesting one, isnt it. <br /><br />I also have told almost no-one that I use this place. I couldn&#039;t even tell you why in a concise manner. The one person I have told, I made sure they didn&#039;t pass it onto anyone. I guess I feel lucky to be a part of this, and its not that I want to keep it for myself, its that I don&#039;t trust it in the wrong hands. So from that - you could well infer that I too think my friends are idiots. <br /><br />I do think it takes a certain type of folk to make the best of this place - and I&#039;m not totally sure you can measure it just on intelligence. That may be a small part of it, but its more like a combination of intelligence, motivation, and open-mindedness and commitment. Its a special blend of all of these things. <br /><br />In the first instance you&#039;ve got to be open minded enough to even believe that this can even exist - i&#039;m sure there are those that fall at the first hurdle. Find it too hard to get their first coins, and decide its all a farce. They get past that... and they&#039;ve got to be intelligent enough to figure out what this whole market model equates to (which is A LOT of complex things - I could ramble for hours on what I think of this). Anyway, if you can get there - you&#039;re feeling inquisitive, and enthusiastic about the possibilities. So that gives you the commitment you need to keep going, even if/when you get burned - which I think many users on here have been, at least once. <br /><br />So, without all that, I can see why your friends, and I believe my friends, would write this place off as overpriced or sketchy. The logical mind will tell you that there&#039;s more to this place than first meets the eye. Unfortunately, that ain&#039;t everyone. <br /><br />Perseverance is key&nbsp; 8)<br />

				Haha yeah. It&#039;s gonna be funny, my friends will be trash talking SR for some bad acid they got while tripping on some amazing acid I got here on the road. Hehehe. They&#039;ll never know.

				I say make it even harder to get in.&nbsp; The idea of going to invitation only sounds good to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;The list of people who should not come on the internet and do illegal things is very large and these same poor souls draw unneeded attention when they inevitably fuck up.&nbsp; The only press you&#039;ll see about SR related arrests are about those who are either too young to know better or are too stupid in the first place.&nbsp; I say keep &#039;em out and leave this place to those who know how to consume and deal drugs (and other &#039;stuff&#039;) properly.

You need to have IRL connections and knowledge. Not just jump on the internet and get drugs mailed to your door.<br />With that said, there is nowhere in Australia where you can get MDMA for the prices that you can get them from European vendors. Even 1kg MDMA in Australia is $60,000 minimum. 1kg MDMA off SR is about $20,000. It might not get through, but if you know what you&#039;re doing there is money to be made. Street price for MDMA =s $250 / gram here. So you could make $200,000 off 1kg, by reselling it in 1 gram increments. A lot of people are aware of this, but don&#039;t seem to realise there is significant risk in doing so and they take very little precaution.<br /><br />One Australian man was arrested when they found over 60 grams of seized coke &amp; MDMA from Europe getting sent to his own house. He had a vendor account and he ended up in jail.<br />If he had of had a proper plan and not rushed into it, he would still be a vendor here.

				About 10% of the customers I deal with are either complete idiots or liars. Also 50% of people I know IRL that has mentioned using silkroad are as dumb as can be and usually bitch about not being able to use it and work minimum wage jobs if they even have jobs.

Many people like to talk of what they hear around (rumors) as if they are things they know from first experience. Your friends probably never tried themselves even entering the SR and they go by the rumors (that are around in many forums) that the place is a scam etc.<br /><br />But in a certain sense it&#039;s better this way. IMO you don&#039;t really want the usual person with his/her IQ of an amoeba wandering here too much.<br /><br />EDIT: I want to explain the last sentence better because it could be understood in a different way than I meant it. I&#039;m absolutely in agreement with the SR being open to all, this is a staple of the place and how it must be; however it is also true that there are some steps you have to overcome (as acquiring BTC, be sure to browse anonymously and without leaving traces in your PC, beware of scams etc.) that act as a sort of filter for certain people that IMO are better they are not here to begin with. The &quot;difficulty&quot; you have to overcome at the very beginning act as a sort of deterrent for lazy and imbeciles (sort of like the typical drug fiend you see around and you don&#039;t want as a client if you are a vendor; it is more an hassle than anything else) and people that could talk immediately just to cover their silly asses.

				Well I don&#039;t have any friends and most of the people that I know doesn&#039;t really use drugs except maybe smoking a little weed and drinking alcohol. Their eyes would bulge if I told anyone I knew a place like this existed but then it really wouldn&#039;t even matter, it wouldn&#039;t spark any interest because as I said most of the people that I know really doesn&#039;t even use drugs to even care about SR.<br /><br />Nevertheless I do believe it takes a special individual to successfully use this service and keep it to themselves. Most people these days just can&#039;t seem to keep their mouths shut for shit, social networking websites has made this even more of a problem. I&#039;ve seen on so many different websites on clearnet (even one time not even intentionally looking) people talking about SR but I just refrain from looking too much to avoid headaches. Although I don&#039;t consider myself to be a genius by any means fact is, the idiots will be idiots and there&#039;s nothing we can do about it.

				With the recent explosion of the RC market, you really don&#039;t know for sure what you&#039;re getting these days. Not to hate on RC&#039;s or SR in particular since it&#039;s impossible to get logistics on who&#039;s selling what, hell I popped my drug &quot;cherry&quot; on 4MMC, but I&#039;ve seen with my own eyes dealers IRL pass off Kilos of Methylone as Molly, grams of 4MMC as cocaine/speed, etc. With the anonymity that online markets provide, the opportunity to lowball and scam people with RC&#039;s, fillers, etc. is always there and easy to take advantage of. I just saw a few days ago with some dude selling fake Diazepam on here, he&#039;s still in business as we speak. Personally, I keep a kit on-hand to test everything before I take it or share it with friends. I think that&#039;s the best anyone can do these days, if you have a heart.

				If SR was brought up to me by someone, I wouldn&#039;t pretend like I had never heard of it. I would most likely claim to have a little knowledge and carry on a conversation, probably shift it towards internet privacy or something. I&#039;m not going to come out and say that I have 16+ transactions and 1700 dollars spent.<br /><br />That would probably freak some people out.<br /><br />I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve really dealt anything off of here, but I have ordered some more than I need of things in order to sell them to friends pretty much at cost. This way I can have people to trip with. Drugs are more fun with friends. <br /><br />Nobody seems to question where I get all these things. A couple of my friends do know where it comes from. But they&#039;re not involved in my shipments or drop locations, so there isn&#039;t really much of a chance that they get pressured by police and roll on me. Especially the friends I have that also use SR. <br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve thought that it would be fun to walk around with a shirt that had the SR logo on it. Just the camel, not the text. Then see if anybody seems to recognize it. You can share a moment of eye contact with that person that says a whole lot.

				What the reaction is doesn&#039;t really matter (if believable). Just as long as it&#039;s practiced.<br /><br />Same thing if cops show up at your door. If you&#039;ve never thought about what you&#039;d say, what tone you&#039;d take, the expression you&#039;d wear, they&#039;re gonna see right through you. Innocent reactions come naturally.

I dont think Im alone on this thought either. its a good feeling to supply the best of the best (in terms of quality) to friends and have them enjoy the product or pass it down the line and make some coin. I make a decent profit doing it, so i can get more and different types of products to share.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When I decide to take a step back I will most likely still be somewhat active in the &quot;drug trade&quot; (for lack of a better term) but in a safer and more relaxed role.&nbsp; At that point I&#039;ll probably no longer sell to anyone outside my very close group of friends but might act as more of a &quot;broker&quot; or whatever who helps other dealers find good suppliers (and will take a small cut as a fee).&nbsp; I&#039;d also probably have it so that the drugs never come into my mailbox or see the inside of my car or apartment.&nbsp; Essentially I&#039;d cut out all major risks.<br /><br />Another good reason to not keep selling for too long is that if you ever use it as a primary source of income for too long then your other professional skills might get a bit rusty (plus unemployment for a year or more looks bad on a resume, I believe).<br /><br />We can reduce and minimize risk but that risk is still there.&nbsp; The stakes are high.
