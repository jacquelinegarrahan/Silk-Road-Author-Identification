				I&#039;m trying to order some herb. I&#039;ve placed the order and the required amount of BTC has gone into the &#039;escrow system. The order is in processing which as far as I have read, means that it is ready to be sent off (correct?).<br /><br />But... The seller refuses to post any items to new users or those without any stats unless they &#039;FE&#039; the item first. I assume this means feedback, the only problem is that I can find out how to leave feedback. I&#039;ve looked everywhere, in my account settings, on the item page, in my orders, on the sellers page and I just can&#039;t seem to find out how...<br /><br />Help, please?

				No.&nbsp; FE means Finalize Early.&nbsp; Your vendor wants his money before s/he will ship to you.&nbsp; You cannot Finalize until the order is marked as &quot;in transit&quot; by the vendor - then a Finalize option will appear.&nbsp; Once you finalize, you will be taken to a feedback screen.<br /><br />Finalizing Early releases the money from escrow to the Vendor.&nbsp; You will then have no recourse if your package does not arrive.&nbsp; However, you will have some difficulty finding a vendor that will sell to a newbie with out FE, especially if the order is large/expensive.&nbsp; There is a real problem with newbies scamming vendors, so vendors want to sell to established customers.&nbsp; If you chose an established vendor, you should be fine.<br /><br />Most newbies place some small orders to limit their risk.&nbsp; And it is worth it to pay more for an established vendor with good feedback.&nbsp; There are vendors that never require FE.&nbsp; Ultimately, it is up to your comfort level.&nbsp; I have FE for select vendors.&nbsp; Got burned once, but mostly I have had tremendous success on SR.&nbsp; Let me know if you have any other questions.<br /><br />Peace!
