				Man, I love Silk Road, maybe just cause i&#039;m rolling balls right now, but SR is my home, I&#039;ve learned more about drugs and drug sfety in my 8 months here than in my entire life. I feel That SR is here to stay. With a moderated drug environment like this, I feel that drugs could easily be legallized one day and follow a similiar protocol. Although some people who learn about SR mainly keep it to themselves so that can make a profit( i learned abiut SR from a high scool kid that made about 30k selling molly from here) I am the exact oppoite. The feeling I get for teaching someone how to use this glorious program, is worth more profit than I could make. I feel like a regular foot soldier in the war FOR drugs, It should be anybodys right to put whatever thay want in them. So Thank you DPR, you are one of my personal heros, you stand in stark defiance of one of the most powerful govenments and they can do nothing about you. It gives me grat hope for the futyre!

I mean, if I&#039;m using whatever I want safely and discreetly regardless of its legality, I&#039;m not going to put in the effort to go out and try to push any kind of agenda.<br /><br />Remember when marijuana legalization didn&#039;t pass in California a few years back? A lot of that had to do with the fact that everyone already had their weed, and the &quot;stoners&quot; didn&#039;t really go out and vote because, hell, they&#039;ve got their shit already. Full legalization wouldn&#039;t have affected them at all. Maybe if they were all completely dry and had no way to get the drugs they wanted, they&#039;d be hitting the polls HARD and it would&#039;ve passed with flying colors. IDK, just my 2 cents

				SR is just amazing, and either way, even if drugs were legal or not, its not going to stop people and the black market from continuing. Theres ALWAYS demand. <br /><br />I told 2 of my friends who were users about SR, they mainly smoke pot but do the occasional E and used to take meth... He wants to try LSD and I tried telling him about it... he was just so ignorant.<br />He didn&#039;t want to learn, and even if i tried to teach him he wouldn&#039;t make the effort to learn about it. I mean he was out of school for so long, and the second he went back he tried for a week and just gave up! I was out of school for some time and when I went back I made sure I was back on track, putting drugs aside for recreational use instead of smoking weed non stop... <br /><br />Anyways, I said ok I can make things easier and get it mailed to your house, its safe, I told him about the procedures and the risks etc. But hes like NO WAY MAN, ITS DANGEROUS, IM NOT STUPID BRO, IF YOU GET LSD THEN I&#039;LL BUY SOME FROM YOU BUT IM NOT DOING THAT MAN, WHAT IF COPS COME TO MY HOUSE, NO MAN NO.. <br /><br />In my head i&#039;m going, yeah, were good friends, at the moment we live far away due to unfortunate circumstances, and in reality he wants me to visit him so I can get him stuff, but he&#039;s all cool if I get caught and busted because its not him right?... <br />I just hate it how some people, (even though they aren&#039;t educated) are ignorant to understand and LISTEN to what I have to say) just stick to their subjective thoughts. <br /><br />Oh well It was my mistake of telling them and since I havent seen them for months they just judge me and probably think I take drugs all day everyday (no offense to those who do, I&#039;ve been there but before I found out about SR)..<br /><br />I learned my lession, never tell anyone about SR, even if they know about it. But it is an amazing site, and I&#039;ve so far loved the people I&#039;ve met on the forums, the safety tips, the postal workers who give out information, the help to ensuring safe drug use... Its just amazing! <br /><br />Enjoy your roll mrxempire! even if I had some I still need about 3 weeks to refill my serotonin levels... Just wish I had extra spending cash to order some stuff ahha :)<br /><br />Cheers guys!<br />

He is quite naive though. This is the same reaction I got out of him.<br />I just laugh and try to explain everything as best I can.<br /><br />I&#039;m like &quot;LOOK, you have stacks of money, you own 5 properties to ship too, DONT SIGN if it gets intercepted and your good.&quot; simple as that. I even told him I would get his coins, wash, and order. all he has to do is tell me wtf he wants and pay me...<br /><br />(hoping I can get a few RC&#039;s myself with small fees) hehe

				I agree Silk Road is incredible - I remember joining 2/3months back and thinking &quot;hrmmmm - not for me...&quot; but it was in the back of my mind and now I love this place! The community is great as is the ability to order goods. I do agree Silk Road isn&#039;t the best thing for the legalization of marijuana&nbsp; but - its format is something that would be useful in the event of legalization for people to be able to purchase Marijuana in a controlled environment.

				SR is great in any aspect. As for the drugs: I can get LSD (which is practically non existent in my area) + the vendors tell me roughly the amount on a blotter. Can&#039;t think of a better service.<br />The forums are full of cool people and I could read here all day (sometimes I do :) ). You learn a lot about drug use and safety. Better than any government campaign.
