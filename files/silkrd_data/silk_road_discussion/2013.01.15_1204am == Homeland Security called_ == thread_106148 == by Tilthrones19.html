				So I FE&#039;d on a order from 10toes this morning around 11:00a.m., then 4:00p.m. rolls around and Homeland Security calls me.&nbsp; Some guy with a strong foreign accent was asking if I am the owner of the house I am residing at, and when I answered &quot;no&quot;, he said that was all, and hung up the phone to leave me in this horrible state of paranoia.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Has this happened to anyone?&nbsp; Should I be worried?&nbsp; Thanks in advance guys.

				There are very few things that didn&#039;t happen as much as this.<br /><br />Homeland security has better things to do then to call around and ask if you are the owner of the house. If they had any concern at all they probably would just drop a smart bomb on your entire neighborhood.<br /><br />You mad because you FE?

				Canuckboy, you nailed it.&nbsp; I just Google&#039;d the number and found that it was an attempted scam.&nbsp; &nbsp;Talk about timing!&nbsp; Sorry about the false alarm, paranoia clearly got the best of me.&nbsp; And just for the record, I&#039;m not worried about FE&#039;ing early, as he is a very trusted vendor.&nbsp; And I suppose I included some unnecessary info, but I was just aiming to give you all the whole story.

Find some way to get a few ninjas in there and maybe a Sylvester Stallone cameo and I think we have a deal.<br /><br />Anyways if you are going to finally nuts up and order don&#039;t sulk on it for so long. You start freaking yourself out over little details that mean nothing.<br />Pretty good learning experience for newer users though who forget that what they are doing does carry SOME risk, even if the good vendors are trying to diminish that risk for them.

				I don&#039;t need to go into it, but I know for a fact that it was not the US DHS. they don&#039;t do a lot of out-calls to civilians, dude. and they wouldn&#039;t introduce themselves as with &quot;Homeland Security.&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;m guessing you heard &quot;home&quot; and &quot;security&quot; and got the paranoia bug bad. it was probably a sales call for a home security service like a poster above me posited. if they&#039;re not speaking to the owner of the home/property, they have nothing to say to you, so thanks and bye. chill out, bud.

				Hahaha omg I love you all here. Some of these post seriously got me luling.&nbsp; ;D ;D<br />But I second that there&#039;s not much relevance between your order and homeland security calling. Although thats fucking weird about what homeland security said, it sounds irrelevant. If it were DEA, yeah maybe I&#039;d be a little more worried.<br />It&#039;s DHS though...<br />TERRORIST! YOU ORDERING SOME WEED! HANDS UP. GTF DOWN&nbsp; ::) Before you know it you may be the one taking care of big bobs dick down in Guantanamo.
