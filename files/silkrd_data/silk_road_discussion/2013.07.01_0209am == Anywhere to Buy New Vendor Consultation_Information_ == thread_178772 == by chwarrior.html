				Hey guys. I was recently thinking about becoming a vendor on SR, and I was reading that jesusofrave offered a consulation service for new vendors. I&#039;m someone who loves training and lessons, and for this type of business it seems like it would be money well spent to learn how to do everything right. Unfortunately, it seems that jesusofrave also shut down his business a few days ago, and I&#039;ve done several searches on the topic and can&#039;t turn up anything else similar to what he was offering. :(<br /><br />Is there anyone else reputable who&#039;s offering a similar service that anyone could point me in the direction of? <br /><br />Thanks in advance. :)

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=103554.msg716134#msg716134<br /><br />Essentially, I&#039;m looking for exactly what was offered here. Sadly, I seem to have JUST missed the boat there...&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Consultation from a vendor who&#039;s very successful and can teach others how to follow suit with such success, for a fee of course. I&#039;m willing to pay for this type of information as I think it&#039;s an incredibly valuable service, and it looks and sounds like jesusofrave was incredibly successful. A step by step guide for a complete beginner on everything related to vending, especially on quickly becoming a successful vendor. <br /><br />jesusofrave wasn&#039;t the only one offering this specific service, was he? That would be very unfortunate if so.

				jesusofrave is still popping onto the forums. <br /><br />You could send him a pm here and ask if he could still sort you out re consultation. Worth a go.
