				I&#039;ve been thinking about this idea for a while and considering making it.&nbsp; Does anything else exist like it?&nbsp; Would it even have to be a hidden service or just require TOR?<br /><br />The pitch:&nbsp; A simple site that allows users to register, and anyone could initiate a BTC transfer via an escrow system for a 5% cost or something.&nbsp; It&#039;d be similar to how SR&#039;s works, just a simple rating 1 star to 5 stars for the users (avg displayed), how many escrow transactions they&#039;ve been involved in, how many the other-end-user was not satisfied with.<br /><br />The only way I could think of to prevent scamming would be , if a resolution was not agreed upon, and one user&#039;s history and rating didn&#039;t drastically outweigh the other&#039;s, the coins would be FROZEN for a month (longer?), and then split 50/50.&nbsp; That still allows a buyer to say he never received anything and never allow the escrow to go thru.... but then again, ti could be used for relationships already established between people on here.&nbsp; There&#039;s be NO information about &quot;buying&quot; or &quot;sellers&quot;, just usernames and escrow.<br /><br />Is it already out there?&nbsp; It&#039;d be pretty much only for times like this when SR is not accessible--could even use same usernames<br />

				so how come vendors and buyers who have worked many times before with each other flawlessly aren&#039;t using things like that?&nbsp; I guess they could just send outright to an address.<br />I don&#039;t even think DPR would mind since we aren&#039;t (and haven&#039;t) been capable of giving the 10%(? that right?) commissions on every sale even if we wanted to (since the site&#039;s down)
