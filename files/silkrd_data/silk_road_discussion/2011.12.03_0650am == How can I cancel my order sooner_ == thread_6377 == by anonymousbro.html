				The seller had his listings on all day, so I ordered. Soon after he took the listings down. He then informed me, 8 hours later he was out of stock.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to get funded here for a week, and now this problem. Anyone?

				The seller should be canceling your order if they have not already. Sometimes it takes a minute I think for the system or there may have been once when a seller said they had canceled but the funds werent refunded so messaged the seller and it was there the next log on... Ask them to cancel it if you arent refunded soon. Hopefully a more awesome deal appears.

				you will have to wait for the cancel option to be turned on, it is in the the order section with your order status.<br />it takes four days after you place your order for it to be an option. <br />you can ask your vendor to cancel the order, but, that means the vendor will have to read the pm, look through his orders and then click on the cancel button. sounds easy, but, it seems that for some vendors it is easier to ignore their customers and let the days go by so that the customer can cancel himself.<br />good luck
