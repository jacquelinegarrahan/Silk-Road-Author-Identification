				Basically, when I began vending I sold a bulk amount (100g of my super pure MDMA) to a buyer here who had great stats, no refunds, never auto-finalized and had spent 3k+.<br /><br />I did not tell the buyer but I sent it tracked (he didn&#039;t have to sign or anything, just the delivery guy ticks a thing on the little computer thing once it has been delivered to notify me)<br /><br />The package arrived fine 12 days after posting to the other side of the globe - but the buyer never finalized. I left it till day 20 and asked him to finalize. Then he decided to claim that it had never arrived and that I needed to honour my 100% refund to him if it never arrived in the next 10 days or I was getting feedback from hell. <br /><br />So I sent him a link to check tracking and I sent him the tracking number and told him that this would be enough proof to SR staff to side in my favour.<br /><br />His reply was &#039;It never arrived but what the hell I&#039;ll finalize anyway&#039; - obviously this idiot was trying to scam me.But when he realised I was a step ahead decided to give up. <br /><br /><br />The exact same thing happened with another customer of mine who was a repeat bulk buyer - he made a purchase every 2 weeks, like two weeks on the dot from the day he received the product. But on his 4th order it was only 5 days after he received the product. That looked strange to me, so I tracked the packet.<br /><br /><br />20 days later - he claims it&#039;s not shown and says &#039;Look at all the orders I&#039;ve placed with you, you know I wouldn&#039;t rip you off&#039;. Tracking says it arrived 10 days prior. I call him out and show him the tracking. He never replies and his funds auto-finalize.<br /><br /><br />All of you buyers always talk about being careful (and you all should be - this place is ripe with scammers) but vendors need to be just as careful because you never know who will fuck you over. Like I state above one of my best customers tried to pull one over on me.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway today is a pleasant Sunday and we are experiencing same main site problem so I thought it would be a good idea to share some stories!&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />

				Once I had a buyer who said unless I refunded him 50% he would call the cops on me and place a voodoo curse on me and wished my family would get raped and fucked by a bus<br /><br />At first I was very angry and upset, and my feedback dropped from 100% to 93%. <br /><br />Contacted SR and they said they do not remove feedback unless it reveals stealth and of course he could not call the cops on me because WTF is he really going to say lol. Now after having much more pleasant transactions I just look back on it and laugh. <br /><br />Wish I still had the message...it was pretty bad..I remember reading it and just getting so upset and angry and pissed. Sales really slowed down after that too and my rating took a huge hit. Big thanks for EntityCreature as he stood up for me and backed up that this was probably a scammer or jealous vendor attempting to ruin my ratings. <br /><br />But yea, as much as it upset me then, now I look back on it and laugh at the dude. Hopefully he hasn&#039;t pulled the same thing on anyone else. It was a pretty disgusting message. The filth that some people speak....you kiss your kids with that mouth?

				Bus fucking - I must say that is the first time I have ever heard of such an action. Original Poster, thank you for pointing out that repeat buyers with great stats can still pose a danger to vendors because you never know when they decide to become a no-good, low down, old fashioned turn coat. It is sad that there are still people in this world with the idea that the &quot;long con&quot; can work in a place full of people who have indubitably been, at one point or another, ripped off due to the very nature of our trade. It simply proves that the &quot;gentleman caller&quot; theory is not a myth but an actual action taken in the market. We should all be cautious. Thank you all again for posting these stories.

				That they don&#039;t remove feedback unless it gives details on how the item was packaged and shipped.
