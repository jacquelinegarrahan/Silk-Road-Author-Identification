				What a fucktard. Send yourself money that you already have? Genius! And for a small fee..<br /><br />You give me the impression you are a junior detective on a crusade trying to find a way to break the anonymity of Bitcoin... Well Sherlock, you should sit on the side a bit longer, watch and learn. soon you will discover the only way LE will stop the SR juggernaut is by x-raying every single mail article in the world, cracking PGP or best case scenario giving up ebforcing our &#039;freedom&#039; and letting us decide for ourselves what is right or wrong, <br />
