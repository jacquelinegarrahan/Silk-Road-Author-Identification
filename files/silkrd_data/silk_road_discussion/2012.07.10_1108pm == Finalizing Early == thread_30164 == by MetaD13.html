				As a new buyer, you should just make small orders to build your stats.&nbsp; Only purchase amounts you can afford to lose, like $20 or so.&nbsp; There&#039;s lots of drug listings in the $20 range.&nbsp; If they require FE, go ahead.&nbsp; If not, don&#039;t.&nbsp; Do your homework and make your first purchases from top vendors to minimize your chance of being scammed.&nbsp; Once you have some buyer stats, never ever ever finalize early, ever again.&nbsp; It just takes some patience and time on the site and here in the forums.&nbsp; Hope that helps.

				Being a new buyer I feel your pain. I so far have a few purchases under my belt and have FE&#039;d on nearly all orders. I would suggest seeking top sellers who have good feedback history and order smaller amounts to start with.<br />On a vendors side, if they post the gear and it has left their hands, it is not totally unrealistic for them to expect payment. They have no control over it when it leaves their place of business and have completed their side of the transaction.<br />Only ordering from people who do not require you to FE severely limits your options. Its all about risk for reward. Would you risk $x to get your stuff safely to your doorstep from a top vender after reading other users reviews verifying the product? If the answer is no, then you may have a hard time here, but good luck with whatever you chose to do.

				And you should also consider what the security by buying here is worth to you, compared to buying on the street.<br />I have been scammed more than one time as a buyer, due to several facts, including my stupidity, low amounts I don&#039;t care about, etc. (mostly on BMR, very seldomly here, but then even from some very reputable vendors - NOT only Tony),<br />But I still consider this the only way for me to buy drugs and other things, the overwhelming majority of vendors here are very cooperative, &quot;honest&quot;, and generally nice to talk to, and of course are shipping what you have ordered.<br /><br />Of course you cannot expect an underground site to act the same way as ebay etc., after all this is anarchy of some sort, there are no laws to protect you other than common sense (which, btw, can also be bought here for a very reasonable price ;) ) and those set forth by DPR.<br /><br />One thing you shouldn&#039;t ever do, unless there are very , very compelling reasons: buy completely outside of SR from a SR vendor. There are actually people who are doing just that and then dare to complain to admins about how they were scammed here etc.

				Most everybody on here has seems to have some really good advise.<br />Also<br />Many new vendors don&#039;t require you to FE. <br />As a new buyer I feel we should help the new sellers (especially if they don&#039;t make you FE) ie KAT (LSD)<br />The only way this community can get better is if it&#039;s bigger. We just need a better way of pegging scammers...<br />I don&#039;t FE unless I REALLY NEED TO. <br />Good luck

I just refuse their order. With that being said, some of the best vendors that have ever been on SR didnt have a 100% rating for the bulk of their time on the road. Its impractical do only deal with 100% positive sellers. Since you are a new member its perfectly reasonable that some vendors dont want your business OR if you really want to do business they want you to finalize early. The logical way to deal with this is by only making small purchases, which is what you should be doing anyway. Alot of times nubs are losing big chunks of money because they want to do a $500 deal the very first time instead of just being patient. If you are unable to be patient and build your stats then someone will end up scamming you sooner or later anyway. <br /><br />The best way to deal on Silk Road since your new is to find a vendor and ask them if they will have the product you want in stock on a regular basis. Then make a small purchase. Once you receive it make a larger purchase if you are satisfied. Do multiple transaction with that vendor and slowly build up to larger amounts. This way you build a reputation with that vendor and you are&nbsp; testing the product and other methods the vendor is using.<br /><br />Remember that &quot;A fool and his money are soon parted.&quot;

				I not sure I understand how a buyer can scam a vendor? The only thing I can think of is if the the buyer claims he didn&#039;t receive anything when he did. And, then claiming a refund or resend. If vendors are worried about new buyers doing this, why don&#039;t they say there will be no refund or reship to new buyers, not ask the buyer to FE. Have I missed something here?

				Got ripped off my first order, seller had a good record (reputation for being slow) and apparently he decided to just rip off a bunch of people and cancel his account.<br /><br />However, my second two purchases have been flawless. I messaged both before placing the orders and made sure they did not require FE. I then release the funds (complete the order) as soon as I can once I receive them.

				Some really good advice here, ty! I joined about 6weeks to 2 months ago, but no purchases yet. I&#039;ve been feeling my way around, reading, getting as much info as i can before i do my first order. This thread has helped me a lot in deciding who to go with and how much to spend, since so many want to FE or don&#039;t do any orders with new members, which i completely understand. So from what i&#039;ve read, my best bet is to go with a reputable seller, buy several small amounts/orders esp if i have to FE, and build my reputation that way. Then I will have more options down the road. Thinking I am ready to take the plunge this week!

				I never require FE and dont realy turn people away either. I&#039;ve had well over 100 transactions without any scammers so either its not as common as vendors make it out to be or I&#039;ve just got an amazing group of customers. I&#039;d really like to see a response option on the feedback to give the seller a chance to explain what happened. Or maybe do not allow brand new buyers to leave feedback but still allow them to file a complaint and request refund. Or maybe even weight the impact of the feedback by the number of transactions the buyer has had.
