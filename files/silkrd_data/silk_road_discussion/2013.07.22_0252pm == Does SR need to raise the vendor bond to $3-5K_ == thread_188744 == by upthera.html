				Yet another vendor with $500 and not a fucking clue.&nbsp; We&#039;ve got to do something before these people ruin this place completely. <br /><br />SR&nbsp; PLEASE RAISE VENDOR BOND TO 3-5 THOUSAND ASAP<br /><br />################################<br /><br />My most recent issue with what must be another windows user.&nbsp; WTF over.&nbsp; I just want to order from vendors with a clue and some respect for buyer safety.&nbsp; &nbsp;This vendor had some C# version of a PGP key on his vendor page but obviously doesn&#039;t know what the fuck he is doing.&nbsp; Before you say that I shouldn&#039;t order from people w/out knowledge of PGP,&nbsp; I would have never place the order, wasted my time, tied up my coin, risked my stats, if he didn&#039;t have a FUCKING PGP KEY POSTED ON HIS VENDOR PAGE!&nbsp; God when do these kiddies go back to school?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />PM exchange after placing my order, which is marked in transit????&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />1.)&nbsp; XXXXXXXXXXX(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My PGP is not working. Can you please send address via privnote? I will get it fixed soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18 hours&nbsp; &nbsp;read&nbsp; &nbsp;delete<br /><br /><br />2.)&nbsp; &nbsp;XXXXXXXXXXX(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please send me a privnote with your address, your package is prepared and ready to go out. Look forward to hearing from you, and thanks for the biz. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 hours&nbsp; &nbsp;read&nbsp; &nbsp;delete<br /><br /><br />3.)&nbsp; ME<br />:-(<br />I do not use Privnote. I have seen way too many people scammed, extorted, threatened, and worse because they used privnote. I will not work with a vendor who can&#039;t use PGP and &quot;My PGP is not working&quot; does not make any sense at all. If u mean that you need 5 min to set up a new PGP keypair, by all means. I do not want my perfect stats to be ruined but I refuse to use a dangerous 3rd part app that has caused tons of harm to SR. SR support will not, or will have trouble helping me if needed if I use privnote and any vendor who asks for it I REALLY have trouble trusting.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not saying that is the case with you, but, and I&#039;m guessing that you must be a windows user as they are the only ones who ever have trouble understanding PGP which if using a real OS like tails or and Linux is never a problem. Look forward to your response. Thanks. If you need advice about instituting PGP/GPG please ask. Otherwise, I need to look elshwere but to be honest I don&#039;t want to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread&nbsp; &nbsp;delete<br /><br /><br /><br />4.)&nbsp; ME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is my order status marked &quot;in transit&quot;? if you could not read my contact details? I&#039;m hoping for the best and will not go to the forums with a name until we speak and I can figure out what is going on with this order. It is a $25-30 and don&#039;t want my perfect stats effected by a tiny little order so I hope we can work this out in a civil way and we can proceed to doe some real business. Are you sure you didn&#039;t post your private key instead of your public key? I just don&#039;t understand the &quot; My PGP is not working&quot; I want the order but will not expose myself to privnote, I hope we can work this out with no ill effects to either of us.&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread&nbsp; &nbsp; delete<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				Raising the vendor bond won&#039;t weed out computer illiteracy. While your vendor is inexperienced with PGP, consider that he or she is smart enough to know where to get product from. <br /><br />You could have sent a practice message in all the time you spent brow beating him or demand an immediate cancel. An order cancellation will not affect your stats. IIRC, the only refunds that affect stats are those given in resolutions.

				No need to raise the bond but for sure SR should have an entrance exam to become a seller. ;D<br />You could call it the SR S.A.T, Every vendor then has their test results on the profile and have the option to go back and repeat the exam in order to improve it. <br /><br />I&#039;m only a vendor here two months and learned pgp in an hour , It&#039;s not hard but people will always have more money than common sense&nbsp; but raising the bond would have prevented me form opening shop&nbsp; :-[<br />

				want to get rid of scammers? Increase bond release to 3 or 6 months. Right now its too easy to build trust the first 6 weeks, then as soon as your get your bond refunded, open a new account, and use the old one to fe and run.<br />

				???? If someone pays $500 for a vendor account, thats it, he&#039;s a vendor. Thats like saying people without a college degree can&#039;t own a business. If you don&#039;t want his business, dont do business with him. and $30... you bought 30 worth and want vendor accounts to raise 6-10 fold.. you&#039;re kidding me

Especially considering that less than about a 1/3 of buyers even bother to use it unless a vendor absolutely requires it. <br /><br />PGP, while easy for you, me, and a whole host of other vendors to understand and deploy, may be that one thing that stumps someone else. As a vendor, I can tell you that less than 1/3 of buyers actually use PGP. So apparently, PGP isn&#039;t as intuitive as it may let on given how often the term is bandied about. <br /><br />What&#039;s funny about the whole PGP affair is that Atlantis figured this out about how difficult it is for people to learn PGP and tried to make it easy. But in the end, it only made people mistrustful of Atlantis because of how they tried to solve the problem. Ironic isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />The other thing is, the commentary about non-Linux OS... PGP is just as easy or as hard to learn on Windows and Mac OS as it is in Linux. I&#039;ve (we&#039;ve, really) practiced with enough customers using all three OSs who wanted&nbsp; to learn PGP to realize that each person is different and has a unique learning curve. <br /><br /><br />As for vendor bond and taking a test to weed out scammers... LOL.<br /><br />1. Higher vendor bond with 3 to 6 month release time frame... then you get the long con. Naturally since now more people will be lulled into a falser sense of security. I&#039;ll take the quick, dumb, FE con (which is rather easy to avoid) over the long con any day of the week. Long cons are harder to spot and really draw you in. They are the absolute worst. Think Tony76. <br /><br />2. Take a test to become a vendor? Why? There&#039;s a wiki. And PGP isn&#039;t the end all be all. You do realize that your PGP messages have to be converted to clear text at some point don&#039;t you? When you get a package with a printed label, how do you think the vendor did that? PGP is more for the vendor&#039;s security than the buyers (unless you&#039;re routinely buying bulk in which case, it&#039;s good for both you and the vendor). <br /><br />Moreover, if a vendor doesn&#039;t know what he or she is doing, he or she (or they) won&#039;t last long. Yes, it can waste the buyer&#039;s time. And in some cases end in a small loss if BTC drops during the time between order and cancellation. But since anything can go wrong with any vendor (remember, this is a black market), that&#039;s the small risk a buyer has to take with each and every vendor. <br /><br />At the end of the day, two things to remember; yea, three things; <br /><br />#1. It&#039;s a black market. (Reiterate that. Some of the new lot seem to think that this is Amazon dot com for drugs. It&#039;s Amazon dot onion for drugs. There is a difference. :p )<br /><br />#2. You can choose to do business with whomever you want. But you have to accept the choice and take responsibility for it. That&#039;s a toughie. I admit as a loooong time buyer on here. Sometimes I ask myself, &quot;self? WTF were you thinking?&quot; Well actually, it&#039;s &quot;Self? WTBF were... hey look a birdie.&quot;<br /><br />#3. Use escrow at all times to minimize loss. Escrow truly is your friend. Even for vendors. Yes, the slow to finalize buyer can disrupt cash flow. But when there&#039;s a dispute, it&#039;s nice to have a third, mostly neutral party to arbitrate and articulate one&#039;s point of view to. <br /><br /><br />And.... it&#039;s a boy. Prince of Cambridge!

				Or in your little world is it privnote that is doing the extorting, threatening AND WORSE?!<br /><br />Does privnote somehow decrypt the data and mail anthrax to you?&nbsp; Or threaten to mail anthrax to you?&nbsp; Or show up at your house and kill your family? ???<br /><br />The data is encrypted using javascript before it even goes to the privnote server and they do not have the keys to decrypt it....<br /><br />Who is doing all the extortion, threatening AND WORSE?!&nbsp; THE PEOPLE MUST KNOW!&nbsp; NAME AND SHAME THEM!!!

Like when Symbiosis first came here he just offered small amounts of MDMA, now look at him! One of the biggest and best vendors on here. <br /><br /><br />Just don&#039;t ever FE on big orders and you&#039;ll be safe.&nbsp; :)

Of course if they had half a brain cell they would try to fly under the radar and keep a low profile, maybe even vend without causing dramas but that is just too much to ask from some people.
