				Some vendors insist you use your real name for shipping, to guarantee delivery.<br /><br />What is your, as a client, take on it? Do you use your real name when shipping?<br /><br />What about getting busted? How would you explain that to a judge?<br /><br />Thanks!

				A friend of mine who orders from SR has a pretty popular website and didn&#039;t make the domain ownership private, and as a result his name and address are all over the internet on various domain info websites. He uses his real name and address, because he thinks that if it went to court, the fact that so many people know his address makes it deniable. I&#039;ve also read stories of packages not being delivered because the name wasn&#039;t exactly right, so combined with his address situation I can understand why he feels safe using his real info. Then again, he doesn&#039;t make that many purchases... if he made more, it might be more of a concern.

				my mail box has my first initial and last name, so I am able to cheat my first name if i wish, even though i get other peoples mail all of the time.&nbsp; I think if the post office see&#039;s a bunch of mail to one persons name then a fake name package from amsterdam it might raise an eyebrow.&nbsp; If your worried about a judge you could always say &quot;i met a dude who was visiting town and showed him a good time, or helped him after he lost his wallet rent a room for a night, and he asked for my address to write a thank you letter and keep in contact to pay you back, and the fucker sent drugs. really i think there is good argument with personal amounts of drugs being sent to an address and most district attorneys wont waste their time with it. by the way try the shipping section, there is probably a post already about this

				Hi,<br /><br />This subject has been talked about quite a bit, but I will try a quick summary.<br /><br />You really have only a few options regarding the address you use to receive your package.<br /><br /><br />You could use a PO box, a dead drop (vacant house, that sort of thing), the address where you work (still basically your own address), a friends address or, last but not least, your own address.<br /><br />I&#039;ll drop the vacant house address from the options right away.&nbsp; Not many people have access to a vacant house where they can be sure the package will in fact be delivered, it could be redirected or the postman may know the house is vacant, too many things could go wrong.&nbsp; I am sure there are some people that can use this option, but unless you can guarantee the post office will in fact deliver to that address I would skip it.<br /><br />Using a friend is possible, but then you open up your friend to all the risks you would have, not a really nice thing to do to a friend (unless he is in on the buy with you).<br /><br />Using a P.O. box means you will need to show ID to rent it, linking yourself to the box.&nbsp; I you use fake ID you add postal fraud to the possible charges.&nbsp; You also show intent when you use a P.O. box, so if this is the route you take you MUST have a good story ready if they ask why you rented it.<br /><br />The most accepted method of a receiving address is in fact to use your own address, but make a few changes to the spelling of your last name and use only an initial.&nbsp; So &#039;James White&#039; becomes &#039;J. Whit&#039; or &#039;J Wite&#039; or &#039;R White&#039;.&nbsp; This gives you plausible reason to deny you had anything to do with the package, its not your proper name.&nbsp; The postman will however, 99% of the time, deliver the mail with a misspelled name.&nbsp; You can easily say: &quot;Hey that&#039;s not me, I wasn&#039;t expecting anything&quot;.<br /><br />The main thing to keep in mind is: deny, deny, deny.&nbsp; Never admit to anything.&nbsp; The package isn&#039;t yours, you didn&#039;t order anything.&nbsp; Never sign for anything you weren&#039;t expecting to sign for (although there have been the occasional case of a package being sent express with the seller forgetting to check of the &#039;signature not required&#039; box, which is the reason you should always make yourself familiar with the way your seller is shipping your product, so you will know if&nbsp; a signature may be required if not waived.&nbsp; That way you will not be too shocked if it happens.&nbsp; It has happened to me and I looked around, saw nobody but the postman, check the package which showed no signs of being opened, and signed.&nbsp; Even then you can still deny, deny, deny.&nbsp; Just say &#039;He asked me to sign, so I signed, I had no idea what it was&#039;.<br /><br />If you get a love letter from customs, just ignore it, they are unlikely to come after you for basically personal use amounts.<br /><br />Here a a couple of threads talking about shipping issues and options:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2413.msg20798#msg20798<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2354.msg20615#msg20615<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2212.msg18484#msg18484<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				My mother receives my packages, so I have to use at least my real first name. I have a&quot;pen pal&quot; who likes to send me a LOT of material! Anyway, the reason give my first name is only for ny dear old mum; so she doesn&#039;t ask questions.

				Yes, I always advise customers to use their real name to ensure delivery. Otherwise they may try to blame the vendor for non-delivery, which is annoying... sigh.

				This has also been said but if you think LE is gonna let you go bc you used a fake name...think again. Getting stuff delivered to your place is plenty of evidence in and of itself.

Getting stuff delivered to your place is plenty of evidence in and of itself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bingo.<br /><br />I would RECOMMEND using your real name, so it does not raise any eyebrows of your letter carrier. But if a Vendor DEMANDS it, that&#039;s a red flag. I wouldn&#039;t buy.<br /><br />If you wish to use a fake name, make that name familiar by signing up for a bunch of junk mail with it a few weeks before you ship to that fake name... It will help make that name look legit. Be wary of your letter carrier asking about the new name.<br /><br />Remember, you don&#039;t have plausible deniability if you get busted holding a fake name, you obviously planned it... Possession is illegal regardless of what name is on the box. If it&#039;s your real name, you have a number of plausible excuses that may save you from pound-you-in-the-ass prison.<br /><br />You may never get caught. You most likely will never get caught. But if you do, a fake name bones you. A fake name looks like a real name if piles of junk mail have come to that fake name. It&#039;s your choice. I prefer to err on the side of assuming that I will get caught at some point, and I like to have a chance to fight it when that day comes. Naturally, I recommend what I practice, it&#039;s the best choice for me. So, I promote it as the best choice for others. If you disagree, that&#039;s your choice. I would never force someone to use a real name, or even ask the difference. It&#039;s none of my damn business. Any Vendor who asks is probably LE.<br /><br />Think about it. If you&#039;ve made an enemy in life (and who hasn&#039;t?), are they going to send you illegal stuff with your name on it, or a fake name on it? This enemy wants to fuck up your life by sending you an 8-ball. Why would he send it to you with a fake name? Of course he would use your real name! How will you use that excuse later? You want your argument to make sense, don&#039;t you?<br /><br />It&#039;s your butthole...

I also like the above mentioned idea of signing up for a bunch of junk mail weeks befoe if you just insist on using a purely fake name. A letter or piece of junk mail that has an unknown name with your address is likely to end up in your box but a package, bubble mailer, etc.. was sent purposefully and is much less likely to have a glaring address error and therefore under much more scrutiny by the carrier.<br /><br />Just my .02 BTC&nbsp; ;)
