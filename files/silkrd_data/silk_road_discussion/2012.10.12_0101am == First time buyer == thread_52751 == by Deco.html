				Hey guys, I am a fist time buyer that has spent a lot of time researching the details to make my first purchase as safe as possible. I, like many of you, am an honest buyer. I have read that first time buyers can be an issue with established vendors. Can you give some advice to get my foot in the door. I am looking for small purchases of Vicodin and bud. How can I sort through the vendors to find an honest seller?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Deco

				Off the top of my head Chronic Crew is an awesome vendor who sells both.<br /><br />&nbsp;Make a small purchase to start out, and maybe even buy a few small electronic purchases of something you are interested in first to show that you are a serious buyer.&nbsp; They should only cost you a dollar or two.&nbsp; &nbsp;Buy an e book or something and leave good feedback, this will help your stats.&nbsp; It is also good practice to&nbsp; buy the electronic items.&nbsp; It helps you get acquainted with the checkout and finalize process.<br /><br />To select a vendor be sure to check out the feedback on his or her page, and search the forums for any reviews or feedback that they may have here.&nbsp; Sometimes a vendor will have good feedback on his or her page, but when you check the forums you will see some different things.&nbsp; Read all the details in the vendor profile on the vendor&#039;s main page.&nbsp; Some vendors require FE (finalize early) for any customers with less than 5 purchases, and some require that you use PGP to encrypt your address.&nbsp; Be sure to carefully review the feedback, and check the ratings for the stealth (how well the vendor camouflages and disguises the packages contents).

				I had nearly given up on the idea that I would ever be able to get pain medication again. Even my quack doctor is so paranoid he cut me off. It seems like nothing short of surgery will get you meds anymore with the docs being so scared. When I found out about SR I was pretty psyched and have been reading all the FAQs and forums. Getting coin seems to be a bitch and everything is more expensive than I had expected but thats the way it goes. I was hoping to do some vending and basically convert some of the stuff that doesn&#039;t work for me into coin so I could purchase what works. I have a damn fentanyl patch I can&#039;t even use because it would make me OD due my tolerance being gone.<br /><br />Oh well, SR is a real life saver anyway. I just can&#039;t face going into the city (Baltimore) and scrounging on the street, white boy like me would get shot most likely.

				I agree with thedog. There are plenty of reputable vendors who will let new buyers stay in escrow. Make a few small purchases from established vendors, and before you know it you&#039;ll be on your way.<br /><br />Speaking from my experience, I probably put waaaaay too much thought into which vendors to choose for my first few purchases. Figure out who has what you need for a reasonable price, check the forums to make sure that they&#039;re legit, and then pull the trigger. I wish I&#039;d spent that energy making sure that my computer/delivery setup was as secure as possible instead. Would have been much more productive.<br /><br />And do the other members a favor and post your experiences on the forums. It&#039;s a community, and it works better if we all chip in.

				Well glad you found a vendor and made your first purchase. We have ALL been there and it is pretty fucking awesome. The wait sucks..but in a good way. Best feeling is seeing that package in the mailbox, then opening it and it is exactly what you want. And like everything else your first time is the best. Though every time is pretty sweet.<br /><br />Since you have made post about this whole experience would you mind making a long detailed post about everything you did leaing up to and including receiving your product? Like the whole experience in great detail. I think it would be a good read and also be a good tool for other new buyers. And I mean include everything and dates if possible..I would really like to know exactly what you did and hoe long each step took you.<br /><br />Glad to hear you made your first purchase. Excited for you and hope your package comes soon!<br /><br />

				No problem! <br />The process took about a week to research and plan the first purchase. I enjoy reading and wanted to be careful, so I wasn&#039;t in a hurry. Once I found the road, I read everything! I started with the basic information from the account set up, and moved on to the buyers guide. In my opinion you really should read everything, even what you may consider irrelevant now, it won&#039;t be later. That was basically the first day after account set up.<br />the second and third day was spent on the forums reviewing the security sections to understand the process of encryption. I dropped in and made an introductory post, to learn the posting process of the forum. <br />I set up PGP and added the link in my profile, to my public keys. I sent the forum member, Pine, a message and joined the PGP club. Cool stuff!&nbsp; In the meantime, I was also reading different stories and bloggers, on their opinion and security of SR. I did a lot of reading. I have a family, and I must be careful. <br /><br />Day 4 was research about the postal system and about bit coins. I wanted coins but not a paper trail of any kind.&nbsp; I decided to simply go to the bank and make a deposit. I have to admit, it was easier that what I had prepared for.<br />A plan was made to handle deliveries....nuff said.<br /><br />Day 5 was all about researching vendors. I spent hours reading the rumor mill....I like reading...and rumors. I chose vendors that stuck to the fundamentals listed on Sr. Each of the vendors did not require Fe early, expected you to Fe on time, and had good reviews on the forums.<br /><br />My first order is in transit, and I don&#039;t anticipate any issues with the delivery. I want to thank all of the members for taking the time to provide specific instruction or advise. All the information literally saved me time and money.<br />Thanks again everyone!&nbsp; <br />Deco<br />

				I saw the advice in a couple of forum posts advising new members to make some small purchases of ebooks, etc. to build their stats. I opted not to do this as it seemed like a waste of good BTC. I figured I had spent the past 2 weeks reading the forums, the wiki, and vendor pages. Figured out PGP. Figured out how to get BTC into my SR account. I was ready to jump in. I selected an item that I was familiar with. Read and re-read the Vendor Page. Checked the Rumor Mill for any posts related to the Vendor. Then...when I was sure of what I was doing I messaged the Vendor (DirtR0ad) to make sure he&#039;d take my order. He responded promptly and professionally letting me know he would accept my order.&nbsp; I added the item to my Cart and checked out. I waited patiently, checked my Orders the next day and saw the item status had changed to: &quot;In Transit&quot;. Waited patiently for the package to arrive. As soon as I received the package and inspected I Finalized the order and left 5/5 feedback. <br /><br />I think research is the key. Go over the material (wiki, forum, etc.) until you understand it. I put the time and effort into research ahead of time and was sure of what I was doing. Doing that greatly increases your chances of success. I believe you are on the right track. Just keep reading until you have a firm grasp of how things are done. And messaging the Vendor you select ahead of time will give a good impression that you have done your research. A lot more so than buying a couple of eBooks.<br /><br />BTW: I consider my first transaction to be a stellar success. I will definitely will be a repeat customer with D1rtR0ad.&nbsp;

				My first two purchases were a success. I ordered from pharmacare and NorCal king. Both of the vendors were extremely professional. The packaging and shipping was excellent. I finalized immediately after confirming. The hours of research certainly paid off. This is completely due to the people who take time to put the guides together and respond to member questions.<br />Thank you, members and administrators.<br />Awesomeness

				Yo thanks for sharing your experience. I haven&#039;t yet made the plunge on my first purchase, but I&#039;m getting closer every day. I just have a lot of concerns and don&#039;t want to screw it up.<br /><br />Can you elaborate a bit on your delivery plan? <br /><br />I live in an apartment. Any harm in simply having it shipped straight to my residence? Any advice you can give?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.
