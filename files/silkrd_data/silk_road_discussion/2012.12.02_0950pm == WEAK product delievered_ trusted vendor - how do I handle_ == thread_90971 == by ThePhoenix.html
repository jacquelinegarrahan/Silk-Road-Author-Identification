				I received some WEAK product from a Highly Rated vendor on here.&nbsp; Being new here, I want to know how to handle this the SR way. <br /><br />I sent him some messages when I tried it, and again an hour later when I tried a different piece of it....the emails were passive and polite, saying that it was a too mellow (weak) and the taste was bad. Its been 24 hours and I know he has been on. I don&#039;t want to think he is avoiding me....but you know how the mind can think of every senario...<br /><br />I wonder if any other people have had same weak product from vendors latest batch......his recent feedback show people are likng the product. I cant be the only one to get a bad order...which makes my mind start swirling....WHY ME? is it because its my third purchase on here...is it because...oh who knows...<br /><br />What usually happens in a situation like this? How do I approach the situation further?<br />ThePhoenix<br /><br />

				Meth<br /><br />I havent left feedback yet in the hopes the vendor will work with me. However if he ignores my email, which I would surprised since its a very well respect vendor...what do I do?&nbsp; I have about half left...plus the bad brown one in one of my bowls.&nbsp; I mean, to ship it back is stupid and unsafe. I am giving him time to see what direction it takes...yes, I am aware this might be a live and learn experience, which would VERY MUCH SURPRISE ME....considering his feedback.<br /><br />what is the resolve button do?<br />do I leave 1/5 feedback?<br /><br />its just not good Karma to let this slide and maybe others get the same because they are uninformed...its my duty to be honest and fair in my review....and it sucks as my third purchase on here<br /><br />

If this is your standard vendor, whom with you have a good working relationship with. Wait a few days (vendors like their weekends just as much as us) and message him again regarding the quality of your next purchase. If he ignores you/claims you&#039;re scamming or something to that degree, then I guess the gloves are off.<br />You can change your feedback to a 1/5, you can call him out in the &quot;Rumor Mill&quot; forum and in the specific product related review thread. Never feel helpless. The entire point of this marketplace is to empower the BUYER and in turn create a free marketplace. It is your right, no, your DUTY, to report your experiences with vendors. Otherwise we&#039;d all just go back to funding cartels, and we all know how DPR feel about that&nbsp; ;)

				Are you 100% sure it&#039;s not a tolerance issue on your part?<br /><br />Investigate on the forums, see if anyone else has gotten this bad batch. Support from others is the best thing you can have on your side.If you&#039;re the only one complaining about the quality of product and have no backing on the claim, you may not have a leg to stand on unfortunately :( <br /><br /><br />How much did you order and how bad was it?<br /><br /><br />You can open a resolution case and talk it out with the vendor. At the end, an SR admin comes in and makes a decision.<br /><br />Tread with caution though cause a trusted vendor can use the private vendor forums to talk about customers. If in the end no one else thinks the product is bad, the vendor may think you&#039;re a scammer and spread the word to other vendors, who may then not want to work with you.

				I am 100% sure its not a tolerance thing. I saved a bowl from the first transaction I did....and smoked it after a few bowls of the problem batch..I smoked it and went RIGHT back up to speedy again. You know its not good when all of sudden you are hungry again and can sleep...<br /><br />the first transaction stuff I did I was up for three days....<br /><br />I am waiting and giving him the benefit of the doubt. I know it happens. I know he may not have known. I would like to think he didnt know....

				Thats exactly how I was trying to handle it. I told him I wasnt going to put negative feedback.

				Wait, how is the potential for a low feedback rating &quot;blackmail&quot;? &quot;Give me free stuff or I&#039;ll give you 1/5&quot; seems like blackmail, but &quot;if you don&#039;t work with me to resolve this issue, which maybe is the result of product you were passed, I don&#039;t know, I will have no choice but to let my feedback honestly reflect the product I received&quot; seems like a legit way to proceed to me (newb that I am). I mean what other pull do you really have?

				so vendor said something like &quot;everyone has an opinion&quot; and was a bit confusing on his answer. I think he is just saying sorry, but thats that.<br /><br />which absolutely sucks. &nbsp;He is a highly rated vendor, so I was a bit surprised. &nbsp;I know sometimes they get bad shipments and I AM a new customer. But in my mind, you treat new people nicely to get a new client. I offered to ship back unused portion, even though I don&#039;t think thats wise or safe. I guess he considers it closed.<br /><br />so what do I do? I certainly DONT want vendors talking negative about me or it will happen again. I cant use resolve because I did get something, altho crappy. If no one else got a bad order, then he choose me to unload on.&nbsp; If others did to, they need to speak up.&nbsp; I havent had a problem with any other vendor..<br /><br />I guess my only option is to finalize and leave bad review (not angrily) and move on<br /><br />opinions?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Make him an offer. Say you&#039;d like to get 33% refunded back. After all it wasn&#039;t bunk, it was just weak in your opinion. He may have to give up profit but at least he wont lose on the transaction. In exchange for the partial refund, say you&#039;ll leave him 5/5 feedback and detail in the feedback comment that &quot;vendor worked with me on an issue and was very reasonable.&quot; You don&#039;t want to say he gave you a refund in the comment because then buyers will try the same thing legitimate or not. <br /><br />BTC can be transferred between SR members. So that&#039;s an option. <br /><br />Anyway, worth a shot. SR resolution likely won&#039;t help you since there isn&#039;t a documented history of your vendor selling weak product.

				I just PMed vendor to clarify that I wasnt trying to scam him and I certainly wanted to work with him. I asked for a partial refund (originally I asked for&nbsp; a reshipment, which probably looked bad but I was a little mad and disappointed<br /><br />Trying real hard to work with vendor.

				I would love to know the outcome of this because I too was also given this stuff... not once... but twice. After alerting vendor of the quality of the first batch and the way it was handled (it was terrible all the way around) the vendor was very sorry and overnighted&nbsp; me a replacement. I&#039;ve never not once had a problem with this vendor.&nbsp; I&#039;ve given it all weekend and I haven&#039;t contacted the vendor about the second batch because I&#039;m gonna chalk it up to the game. This is pure speculation and my opinion but I do fully believe the vendor knew that it wasn&#039;t good. Maybe even didn&#039;t have enough product to fill orders since the shipments went from good packaging to just thrown in a vac seal baggie. I&#039;ve also notice I wasn&#039;t the only one with a problem but those people later edited their comments or deleted them. Something funny is up. I&#039;m not here to call the vendor out at all he&#039;s always been courteous but I will buy elsewhere. <br /><br />So does anyone know what I&#039;ve been putting in my lungs? It melts like real stuff... it&#039;s very very watery though and turns into a light amber color. The stem of the pipe instantly turns white. It smokes but not not well cause it practically requires direct heat on the product at all times to create the vapor. The product cracks back almost immediately. It spreads quickly to the whole bowl with very little effort. Immediate headache.... very horrible body load (like i was stoned)... and no come up at all,<br /><br />Lesson learned yesterdays order isn&#039;t gonna be todays no mattwe who you get it from.

				I was contacted by the vendor and he is sending a replacement on Monday. He seems to be wanting to work with me and not really interested in me finalizing the transaction or the feedback, just that he did right...which really impressed me...<br /><br />I didnt ask if it was sending some from the same batch. Maybe I should..<br /><br />I feel he is now communicating with a clear head. One message was very confusing. I am not going to suppose if he knew or not....or what happened...IF the replacement is good...I will then give &quot;vendor is working with me..&quot; feedback<br /><br />I will let you know<br /><br />

				sounds like a situation I had last year, vendor had premium service and shipping, everybody loved him. I tried his gear 3 times, 1st was ok the shipping was super fast product just ok, gave him 2 more tries and talked with him about the situation and shitty product. He said basically &quot;sorry to hear that&quot; i chalked it up to the game, and have been scared to order from canadians cause I do not want any more of his product. This particular vendor makes his own meth and MDxx. just sayin

				That&#039;s awesome that things worked out for you. Now don&#039;t forget to go back and change your feedback to 5/5. <br /><br />So many buyers forget to do that or give a 4/5 for the aggravation when they do. <br /><br />Is it any wonder why sellers can be so hostile at first when a buyer has an issue?
