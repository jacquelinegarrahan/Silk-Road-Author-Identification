That is already known about here because it would be difficult indeed to response to messages if they didn&#039;t, but that place? It&#039;s not a market. It wasn&#039;t made for people like us. It doesn&#039;t exists for SR to use it. It isn&#039;t run by SR. So don&#039;t trust it. (Don&#039;t trust SR either of course, but at least it has some reputation to back it up.)<br /><br />Note: I assume that without viewing the site or even knowing what it is called. Tinfoil hat.

				I&#039;ve used that with vendors on here when they left and went private, especially when we had the downtime.<br />I don&#039;t know much about it but I do know it works because I&#039;ve done business through there a few times already.

She stated that anonymity is her greatest protection -- as long as she can&#039;t be located, neither can her servers.&nbsp; She further stated that the box that TorPM runs on is LUKS-encrypted, and that the RAM sticks were epoxied in-place, in the event of a raid, to help prevent a cold-boot attack.&nbsp; She also went out of her way to stress that people should use PGP encryption as a further safeguard, to keep their messages private. <br /><br />NC<br />

				Thnks for posting that info NC. I had done the research myself but at the time posted about it was super tired and just wanted to let ppl know it was there and a decent place. I forgot to come back and add all that about the security of it, Most of us on SR are all computer wizz&#039;s or whatever u may call yourself si i knew if it was checked into they would realize it was safe and secure , Id feel safer on there then on BMR! lol
