				Hey Now!!<br />Quick question, I have placed an order from a top seller and it is taking quite along time to arrive, to the point I fear it is lost, snatched, missing, whatever. My question is should I go ahead and order the other party favors that are required for an approaching event, or wait to see what is up with this order? I am running out of time and with this being my first sr experience my spider senses are pinging out,i.e I am paranoid as hell. If this was nabbed along the way will they be keeping an eye on my address? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also I don&#039;t think there would be any problem on sellers end they are top notch. Thanks.

				Hey Now!!<br /><br />I have been in a similar situation. I was the seller. SoandSo had a party. REQUIRED party favors.... Yada yada yada. Buyer ordered, I couldn&#039;t come through. I immediately contacted the buyer. Waiting wasn&#039;t an option! So I canceled and consulted with the buyer on who else to try. Long story short, it worked out for them.&nbsp; :) <br /><br />Shipments get intercepted for a million reasons. OR just simply lost. Be careful but not weird or unusual. IF, IF, big if&#039;s here. IF you are being watched, act normal. Go check the mail, wash the car, whatever. <br /><br />Try another vendor. Don&#039;t let paranoia rule you. Don&#039;t let the party down. Sac up, champ!&nbsp; &nbsp;:P
