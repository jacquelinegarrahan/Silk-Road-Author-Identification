				&nbsp;For some reason, whenever I&#039;m waiting for an order to be delivered, I tend to sign onto SR and the forums more often. SR more often than normal, as I browse the forums quite often.<br />But I find myself browsing listings on SR alot more while waiting for a package to come.<br /><br />&nbsp;It reminds me of when I was a child, a month or so before x-mas or my birthday, I would always look at the Toys R US catalog or similar catalogs.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Does anyone else find themselves doing the same thing?

				This site is almost my life, even though i haven&#039;t had any coin in a month I still just browse products and think &quot;hmmm maybe i can throw 20 dollars in my account and try this&quot;. But then i end up staying home and not doing anything about it... but i think this week is the week!<br />I think i am more anxious about checking my mailbox than sr, it&#039;s almost an ocd habbit. got all the times the mailman comes down to a science, pretty soon i&#039;ll know where he eats lunch

				I&#039;ve made enough orders that I&#039;m not likely to run out of any of the stuff I enjoy, but when I first started shopping on SR, I spent a lot of time on the site looking around. While I still haven&#039;t made the connection here that initially brought me here, I&#039;ve made dozens of successful orders and have a great stash of all sorts of good stuff that has greatly improved my free time. I don&#039;t spend as much time browsing as I used to.

				I am glad to see I am not the only one who stalks my mail carrier. I almost always find myself browsing both forums and SR while waiting on shipment, then I am like oh damn it I should&#039;ve waited and ordered that better quantity better price! It seems&nbsp; can never get coin in fast enough to catch who I really want to buy from. Wish didn&#039;t have to leave house to get coin.

The first time I ordered Nbome, the days after while browsing, I saw vendor selling the same quanity for about 15 dollars cheaper. I was like FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. But then I got the package, dropped 2 tabs, and thought, hey, maybe the guy I ordered from needed the money(was in a jam or something similar.) I think its just a psychonaut thing to feel the empathy, and not let the little things get to ya.<br /><br />&nbsp;@Christy Nugs: Well if I ever order from you, you better be on here non stop getting that shipment here quicker ;)

				SR and the forum are so addictive!<br /><br />I&#039;ve learned to chill waiting on a package to arrive since first using the road with experience. I think it&#039;s part of the experience almost exciting hoping and waiting on your order to arrive forgetting that it&#039;s not a pizza delivery order that will get to you within half an hour! <br /><br />I really need to find other things to fill my time than being on here coked up!!!&nbsp; :)

				Aha, I find that I log onto SR more often when I await the finalization of orders. Like three days after I ship out, I check &quot;too&quot; often.

				Yes I do, and I also take those pre-approved credit card offers &amp; fill the pre-paid reutrn envelopes up with shredded paper, partly in an effort to bankrupt the CC company, but also to see if the mail has come for the day - someone earlier said &quot;stalking the mailman? But even if I am not waiting for a present I enjoy the forums - loads of interesting conversations!
