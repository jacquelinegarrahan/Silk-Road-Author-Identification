				I placed an order last night and the order appeared in my Orders section.&nbsp; Today I log in and the order has a 0 and I never got a confirmation of the order from the seller.&nbsp; I sent a message to the seller but I&#039;m not sure if things are working right or if there&#039;s a glitch or if something more sinister is going on?&nbsp; <br /><br />Any words of wisdom?

				OK.&nbsp; Just checked and my order was cancelled.&nbsp; No idea why?&nbsp; The problem though is that my account balance is 0.00.&nbsp; If my order was cancelled where is my money?&nbsp; I think it&#039;s bullshit to cancel someones order and not even tell them why it was cancelled.

				Many Vendors will not deal with people who have no purchase history, as they could just be anew account created to get a item and report it never came. <br />It does suck however when someone cancels with out telling you why. <br />Your money should show back up, if not contact the Admin buy using the Contact Us button at the bottom of the main page.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				OK.&nbsp; So my money was refunded at October 29, 2011, 8:34 am UTC&nbsp; and then it was withdrawn at October 29, 2011, 8:36 am UTC.<br /><br />Did I just get hacked?&nbsp; And it&#039;s a little weird that my money would be refunded and 2 minutes later is withdrawn.&nbsp; <br /><br />What&#039;s my recourse here?

				Contact the Admin, using the Contact Us button. <br />He will be able to give you more info. <br />Hopefully you didn&#039;t get here using the Hidden Wiki as everyone seem to just hit password phising clones from there.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I just find it VERY ODD that 2 minutes after my money is refunded by the seller it gets withdrawn.&nbsp; Should I be looking at the seller as the one who had something to do with this?&nbsp;

				Here is how it happened. At some point in time you logged in to a site that was not the real site. you didn&#039;t change your password after that. <br />Unlike what most people here think,n fact I do not&nbsp; phishers don&#039;t always change passwords as soon as we gain access to your account. Ichange the password unless there is a<br />change passwords unless I find a seller account, that I can either sell or use for my next scam.<br /><br />the moral of this story is change your password often!<br /><br />and don&#039;t spend your unemployment check on drugs moron!

				New Username.&nbsp; Same Asshole.<br /><br />First off, thanks for telling me how it was done.<br /><br />Second.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t spending my Unemployment check on drugs.&nbsp; I&#039;m Unemployed and had Rotator Cuff surgery a couple weeks ago and if you know anything about Dr&#039;s in the USA they don&#039;t give you enough pain meds to make it all the way through recovery with physical rehab being very painful.&nbsp; So I didn&#039;t spend my unemployment check on drugs.&nbsp; I spent $60 on pain pills.&nbsp; Not weed or coke or whatever.&nbsp; $60 is a lot of money to me right now but with the pain I have I thought it might be a good investment.&nbsp; If I spent a few hundred bucks on MDMA or Coke or something frivolous I&#039;d say I&#039;d had it coming and I was an asshole for wasting my unemployment check but it&#039;s not the case.&nbsp; To the person who ripped me off it&#039;d be really cool if you were somewhat of a cool human being and just replaced the measly (I&#039;m sure to you) $60.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of a lot of money to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I am not the one who took your BTC, and your explanation of what you are doing here satisfies me, so I will send you some coins to make up a bit from what you lost. I don&#039;t have enough right now to replace everything that was taken, but PM me your bitcoin address, and I will send what I have over

				Coming back to seeing people phising so heavily makes me really unhappy. <br />Simple story, encrypt a small drive throw Tor Brower on there PGP the URL and problem solved. <br /><br />Also never use a password you have used elsewhere. If it&#039;s semi-unique it could be cross checked against password dumps from popular site to find username and internet detectiving can starts there. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
