				We are in the process of trying to find good content on the forums to be added to the wiki. If any of you know of a good thread that should be added to the wiki, please feel free to send me the link.<br /><br />Also, If you have written something on the forum and DONT want that info on the Wiki, let me know. In all situations. (unless you want us too) we wont reveal who wrote the info. I know normally its proper to give credit on all writings,&nbsp; but we are in a different area where the author may not want to be known.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />CP

				Also, please remember that when SR announces that the wiki is available I would consider it pre alpha, lol.... Since the program we are using is still in beta. (maybe its out now) I have had a heck of a time figuring things out. So, at the beginning there wont be much meat. Im hoping that someone will see a need and do the writing.<br /><br />At first, the wiki will be read only, (for obvious reasons). but as time goes on, I hope to add writers, etc.<br /><br />So, be kind to me an the other admins of the wiki at first. I have spent a lot of time just figuring out the darn software, its been a great learning experience. We were going to announce it within days, but we have decided to format it a little differently, so that will set us back a bit.. Im excited to get this up and going. <br /><br />Its my hope that once a buyer or vendor reads the wiki, they will have enough info to make a safe,&nbsp; worry free transaction.<br /><br />BTW, thanks to those that have offered to write. I have taken up on your offers.
