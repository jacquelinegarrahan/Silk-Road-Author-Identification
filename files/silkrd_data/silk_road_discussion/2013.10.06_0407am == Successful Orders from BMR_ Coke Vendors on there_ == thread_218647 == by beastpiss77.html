				I haven&#039;t really seen much feedback about people who have successfully ordered from BMR, just a lot of speculation about whether it&#039;s good or not. So, has anyone here actually placed and received an order from BMR? Have you dealt with vendors who have moved over there from SR? I know it&#039;s going to take some time to build trust with other sites, but I&#039;m getting kind of, uh, antsy, and would like to order something soon.<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty much mainly cocaine that I&#039;m after. I see a couple of vendors on BMR whose names I recognize, but only one that I&#039;ve personally dealt with before (Dragoncove). But how would I know if it&#039;s actually them? Of course I&#039;m worried about LE and scammers impersonating known vendors. Haven&#039;t seen any posts from Dragoncove on here indicating that he&#039;s moved over there, but there are a lot of posts to sift through. <br /><br />Can anyone vouch for any coke vendors on BMR (preferably US-based)?

				Checked out Rails on BMR and they&#039;ve been there since 30th April 2013. As far as I can remember, Rials have said on here they will setup soon on BMR and Sheep&nbsp; I think but haven&#039;t replied to a question asking if they&#039;ll use the same name.<br /><br />I sent an encrypted message using the PGP I have for them but got a weird reply saying I have to use PGP for my address with an order which had nothing to do with what I asked so I replied asking if they had read my encrypted message and they replied &quot;I&#039;m not able to decrypt messages most of the time.&nbsp; Please send me your question<br />unencrypted.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you do order than yes PGP only for your address.&nbsp; Thanks&quot;<br /><br />They have to be able to decrypt a message if they can do it for an address within an order surely?

				Just to add, as far as trust goes on these sites, I got on with Rails message and order wise and because he/they couldn&#039;t read my message using their PGP I have, find it a bit suspicious with no answer yet to whether they changed their PGP recently!

				Iv never been a Fan of the way BMR is set up.. Its just not as user friendly IMO. But their our ways to read feedback from buyers if there are any and see the vendor score/rating..<br /><br />Only site i got something from other than SR Was when PeoplesDrugStore made his own site and then a month into it he quit then someone is stillrunning it acting like him but is not him...<br /><br />He sent me a 100mg tester for 20 bucks, after than got a G and he let me get it for great price since i was his first buyer on the site since he launched it.. It was for sure great HIGH qyality H, Almost better than Subs,The legs were for sure a lot longer , and OMG the rush was out of this world!! <br /><br />The site is still running is anyone wants to onion i think i still got it, but i dunno who is under control of it so i advise not to mess with it ..Plus Hes ON BMR.<br /><br />Dont know how he&#039;s doing there, but he sent me the 2 times just fat chunks of rock, no powder. Very lovely . Hes from Canada

				Dragoncove on BMR has no transactions and no feedback, though they have had an account on there since May. I don&#039;t really know what to think of that. It makes sense that a lot of vendors who have just moved over there obviously have no history.<br /><br />But, I&#039;ve just read on the SR forums that in the week or two following the SR takedown, DC&#039;s SR account had been suspended, and it looks like they may have scammed some people too. So I&#039;m a bit sketched out by that. <br /><br />The Rails situation sounds kinda suspicious too. <br /><br />I guess I will probably have to wait a couple weeks and see if other people are having good experiences on BMR.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really a huge fan of it either, but it&#039;s all we&#039;ve got right now.

				I&#039;ve been scoping out BMR since the shut down and just made a Sheep account tonight. Honestly as far as H vendors go we&#039;re fucked, we were all spoiled with SR. I mean there&#039;s good shit there it looks like, just nothing as cheap or well-reviewed as what we had on SR. Because Sheep seems to be a little smaller it does seem to be a bit cheaper, but BMR seems to have recruited more ex-SR vendors. So far BMR&#039;s got DragonCove, Purest, CrystalShip and if I&#039;m not mistaken a few others, can&#039;t think right now. Ugh I just wish my last SR orders would arrive! Anyway point is, after making a Sheep account tonight (though at first I was pretty adamantly not for it) I&#039;m starting to lean toward it more... never thought I&#039;d say that.<br /><br />I just want my SR back.

				I made a Sheep account too, but like a lot of people, it just didn&#039;t sit right with me. <br /><br />We all want our SR back, I mean obviously, nothing compares. And I truly believe we&#039;ll have something as good, if not better, in the future. But for now, if we want our drugs, we gotta settle for what&#039;s available.<br /><br />I just can&#039;t make any purchases on BMR until I feel like I can trust the site and the vendors.

				If I were to send Dragoncove a message on BMR using the PGP key that I used when I ordered from them a couple months ago, and they&#039;re able to decrypt it, would that definitively prove that it&#039;s the same vendor from SR? Is there any way that LE (or whoever else) could decrypt that message if they had somehow infiltrated DC&#039;s account?<br /><br />But if DC changed their key since I last dealt with them, then they wouldn&#039;t be able to decrypt my message. So there&#039;s that.

Of course there are some that are who they say they are that are using new keys for obvious reasons, but the fact remains original PGP keys are the only way. Trust your gut.
