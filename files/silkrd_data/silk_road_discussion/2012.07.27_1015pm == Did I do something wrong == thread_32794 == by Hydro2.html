				Hello, I have had 10 transactions, I have never written anything bad about anyone, but now everyone is ignoring my notes. I have people holding my money, and looks like a vendor I trusted exclusively ask me FE before i received the product, also looks like I got a fake dcn. One said they would ship the next day and now it sitting in processing and he wont write back. I worked hard to be nice and accommodating, but the one who asked me to FE, I believe did not plan on stealing, and yeah I know what a pussy, but my feelings are hurt.<br /><br />Please can someone help me?

				Don&#039;t FE if you&#039;re an established buyer. Just move on to another vendor.

				When you say everyone how many people have you tried to contact ? Remember that people might not come online as regularly as your messages are sent, so your messages might go missed.<br /><br />You&#039;re well within your right to question a vendor&#039;s unexpected request to finalize early - if it&#039;s not mentioned in their listing, or your stats meet or exceed their FE requirements, then they should explain why they are asking for it anyway, as far as you know they could be trying to scam you!<br /><br />Best to not let stuff get to you though, with so many variables in play on SR you could be getting yourself down for no reason :)
