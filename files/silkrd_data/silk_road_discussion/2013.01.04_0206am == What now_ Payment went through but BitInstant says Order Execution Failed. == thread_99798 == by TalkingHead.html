				I did the ZipZap cash payment thing (as I always do with no problem) a number of hours ago but the coins still haven&#039;t shown up here. I checked the Bit Instant site and saw the above status. I emailed them twice but still haven&#039;t heard back yetsa. Has anyone had this happen to them? Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks!

				BRO have u checked blockchain to monitor your transaction? Iv never had this happen, but i emailed Rachel today and she responded to me within minets and said the site is up and running fine no worries and they are hear for the long run, Rachel and I know eachother on a first name basis now, even though i use a fake now, and she is very nice and helpful ..You need to see what is going on with blockchain, see how many confirmations your transaction is at..

				The last time I used bitinstant something like this happened. I email the site admin, and provided all the info of my payment and what not, minutes later I had my coins.<br />sometimes they have trouble with things like that.&nbsp; Happens alot if you use the dwolla method--&gt;btc (which you shouldn&#039;t)

				I dont know why people just dont make it easy and use the straight to SR address? All u should do is chnge the account number time to time.. Half of u people pay sooo much xtra money on a waste of false sense of security.. YOUR DOING NOTHING ILLEGAL WHY GO THROUGH ALL THAT AND SPEND XTRA? Im pissed enuff Bitinstant charges what they do to change into bitcoins, i would never pay more than bitinstant, if there is a site out there, thats just as easy, and for less, please tell me, and id prefer not to use sr vendors, just not something u fully trust. At least with BITinstant u will have ur money found and crdited if something haooends, ALWAYS! TAKE OFF THE TIN FOIL HATS

				Hey AA, I DID go straight to my SR address (I always do that these days), I checked blockchain (no fee at all) and there have been 0 transactions and I emailed Bitinstant THREE times with no response. Are you concerned when you call that they&#039;ll have your phone # and will then know who you are or do you just block your #. I&#039;m going to have to call today. This is ridiculous. I did the ZipZap payment yesterday afternoon and there&#039;s been no movement at all.

				I FINALLY got this reply from Rachel:<br /><br />&quot;I sincerely apologize for the issue and the delay. I&#039;ve forwarded your order information over to our Technical Support department and they are working on pushing your funds through our system. Rest assured your funds are safe and we&#039;ll honor the amount listed on your order update. You should receive your bitcoins later today. Once again, I apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience.<br /><br />---<br />Sincerely,<br />Rachel&quot;<br /><br />So, we&#039;ll see...<br />
