				Well, I&#039;ve been on and off SR for a long time now, but I make a point to never use the same personal address/sr account for more than a year.<br /><br />It came time for the new acct, and I&#039;m curious if things have changed around here in the last year since I bought last. Are reputable vendors scared of brand new accounts all of a sudden(i.e. that last 14 months)?<br /><br />Placed two orders, for less than 200 bucks total, from two different 100% feedback vendors that said they would do business with me (via PMs). <br /><br />I haven&#039;t heard back from either vendor since then (~the 7th of this month), and both my orders still stand. Now I&#039;m going to talk to these vendors later today if I haven&#039;t heard back, but am I missing something? I&#039;m not new to SR per se, but it has been a while so I&#039;m starting to feel like quite the noob.<br /><br />In summary: Has a lot changed at SR in the last 14 months? (within the vendor community)

				There are always new things changes ever so slightly and big things occasionally. But i think your question is a little off. Because you now have a new account, sellers want to think they will be secure and receive there money if they deal with you. SO what i recommend you do, buy about 5-10 &quot;digital goods&quot; or &quot;eBooks&quot; that will boost ALL your stats besides money spent. Than once you have 5-10 transactions buy something worth a few hundreds dollars.<br /><br />Than your stats will be PERFECT and with 10+ transactions MOST all vendors will be more than happy to sell to you<br /><br />Hope that helps<br /><br />SBmafia

				Go figure, soon as a go as far as to post in the forums, everything resolved itself!<br /><br />Thanks for the advice though, I might still go and buy a few ebooks or somethin&#039; ^^

				bear in mind any vendor worth dealing with will check your stats in detail (i do), and i tend to consider a large amount of transactions of low value more suspicious than being a new buyer with no stats. its a technique used by scam buyers to bump stats, so obviously you want to avoid being painted with the same brush. <br /><br />until you&#039;ve built up your stats a little bit just stick to low stat friendly vendors and remember the golden rule, don&#039;t finalize early!<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />UKshrooms

				I wouldn&#039;t go try boosting your stats with E books. Vendors can see how much you spent so it&#039;ll be obvious that you are just boosting them. Try starting small or go with vendors that except new buyers.

				I am in a similar situation. <br /><br />I made 2 relatively large orders (total about $1000) that haven&#039;t arrived. I have discussed it with the vendors and that have asked me to wait a couple of weeks longer before giving up completely (It has already been almost a full calendar month). <br /><br />Sadly, the refunds (only partial, not full amount) are going to f*ck up my buyer stats because the vendors will not reship to Australia. I have a friend in Germany. I may just have them send it to him and let him have it as a gift to avoid wrecking my stats.
