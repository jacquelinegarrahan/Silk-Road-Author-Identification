				Hi.<br />I have been a vendor on SR for 5 months now and my business is going very well. I’m very honest and deliver a really really good product. <br />I’m selling injectable steroids. There are 2 problems dealing with this kind of product. 1. The markup is not that good because of competition from other steroid dealers on SR. 2. It is very difficult to hide/stealth glass vials. X-ray will see that very easy. So I use very expensive stealth objects costing around 15-22$ a piece. Double that for packages over 10 vials. So the shipping expenses look like this.<br />Stealth object= 22$<br />Envelope=2$<br />Stamps for EU=6$<br />Stamps for Australia=10$<br />Tracking=13$<br />total cost for shipping=43$ - 47$<br /><br />And this is regardless if i ship 1 or 10vials.<br /><br />No one will pay that amount for shipping. So i take the loss and offer them at 18$ (36$ for Australia) and loos 20$ or so.<br /><br />So as i said my business has grown very well. Mostly due to good customer service and an awesome product. So 3-4 weeks ago i decided to no longer offer refund or reship or use tracking for orders for 1 or 2 vials.&nbsp; Making 30-35$ on 2 vials minus SR provision and then spend 13$ on tracking + plus the loss, seamed like a terrible deal. So i wrote that on my vendor page.<br /><br />Also you need to know that if you use steroids you need a lot more the just one.<br /><br /><br />My problem is that these guys that have ordered 1 or 2 are claiming that it hasn’t arrived or that i didn’t send it. I have a really good product and a good business and would never risk it by not sending the product. <br />Plenty of 1 or 2 vial orders god thru and they leave great feedback, but now i can see that 3-4 guys are going to leave me bad feedback and i cant afford that. Good rating is everything. When i tell this guys that they knew the rules when they ordered they still want a 100% refund witch I’m not giving them. But they leave bad feedback witch hurts me. I never look at people’s ratings or ask anyone to finalize. I feel that I would be impossible to win them all but I see a lot of you big pot and mdma vendors have a perfect record and well over 1000 transactions. How do you managed that?<br /><br />So what do i do? Do i stop selling orders under 3 vials. Do I charge 40$ in shipping? Please let me hear your thoughts on this. <br /><br />DD<br /><br />Forgot to point out that sending something with tracking gets your face on a camera.<br />

				Well im currently looking into becoming a vedor, And i was asking the exact same question, The answers&nbsp; got were these.<br />If the guys are from the same place, Require all people from there FE or dont ship to that area.<br />You cant really do anything about it, So just state your rules clearly and either send it some tracked way, or accept it as the cost of doing business.<br /><br />There were&nbsp; few more heres a link to the thread.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172692.30<br />

				Hello,<br /><br />Set your minimum at 5 and do the international express tracking thing....and put the full cost of shipping in there......they will pay it....trust me........sure your sales will slow down.....they should....you don&#039;t need to make as many sales because you volume per order will be much better.<br /><br />As far as those scammers.....just refund their money put them on the black list and move on......keep your rating up.<br /><br />good luck

				HeatFireFlame..&nbsp; Asking people to FE is against my belief. I think it sends bad karma and besides, asking people to FE doesn&#039;t help. They can always go back and change there rating.<br /><br />CaliforniaCannibas.. Thanks for your reply. I would hate to do a minimum order. Injecting a oilebased steroid deep into your muscles is very much about trust. This is not mdma, coke or pot where you can just do a little. So when finding you &quot;source&quot; for roids you stay with him as long as he can deliver. A lot of times people buy 1 vial to check the quality and then return for more later. Also a lot of Australians buy one to see if it passes customs and when it doesn&#039;t they give me a 1. I have 113 transaction ranging from 60$ to 1500$ mostly people buy for 180$. Out of those 113 i only have 4 &quot;one´s&quot; That brings my score to 89% Those 4 bought fore 50$ to 150$. Seam to me that that is a very harsh rating system. But i will take your advice about the shipping costs.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think anyone will gain anything from setting a minimum order. Certainly not SR and not the first time buyer. And i wouldn&#039;t get as many new costumers. I was thinking about changing the policy to just give a 50% refund and then telling the buyer that i dident want his business in the future. But when i don&#039;t look at his stats he could easily just make a new account. I do not keep anyone&#039;s address so i cant use that either. <br /><br />It seams to me that there is a problem with the rating system. I do not have any way of telling me side of the story to someone giving me a bad review for the wrong reasons. <br /><br />I could raise the prices with 50% for orders under 3 vials and then offer a 50% refund on the vials when seized. i just dont know how to do that.

				I can get you the raw steroid powders cheap and you can get the vials, filters and crimper on clearnet so you can mix it and put it in the vials yourself for dirt cheap like the UGLs do.&nbsp; Ever thought of doing it yourself instead of selling another UFLs vials?

				Jack N Hoff.&nbsp; NO. absolutely not. I can tell you that that would differently make people sick. You need a real lab with clean room and everything. Diamond may be an UGL but the facility&#039;s are not.

				Many experienced body builders often buy small amounts of the raw steroid powders and make their own vials for them or them and their friends on a small personal level. ::)

				Solution to your problem: <br /><br />1. Devise refund rules that offer buyers some protection but are priced into your profits (and this is overall - don&#039;t just look at one product).<br />2. State these rules clearly on your profile<br />3. Mention that buyers agree to your rules when purchasing on your product page<br />4. Offer refunds based on these rules in the resolution centre - SR will always find in your favour if you outlined Ts &amp; Cs in advance.<br />5. Always engage in active, friendly dialogue with buyers to ensure you still get good feedback even if it hasn&#039;t arrived. <br /><br />But note, there will always be dicks who try to blackmail you and leave bad feedback. It&#039;s part of the SR game. Don&#039;t let them bother you and keep on doing what you&#039;re doing. Your feedback should still be high 90s and even if it&#039;s not, take consollation in the fact that some of the biggest vendors on here have terrible feedback scores. Supertrips is one who comes to mind. He makes ~ $500k a month and last I checked he had a sub 90 (just see he&#039;s actually recovered to 96) feedback score. <br /><br />Basically don&#039;t sweat it too much bro :)
