				Hey guys,<br /><br />I`m very new here, managed to register just before the shit hit the fan, and been waiting patiently for the site to come back up, lurking forums meanwhile. <br /><br />I read that 5 successful transactions are a must for anyone to be able to purchase, and just wanted to confirm - is that still the case? Its just that i`m less interested in new books and more in some psychedelic substances LOL.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Hooboos.

				I&#039;m gonna go ahead and guess that the 5 transactions refers to some vendors who won&#039;t sell to newbs with zero transaction history, and one way folks used to deal with that was making purchases of e-books and other downloaded material, enabling them to get their stats up, quickly.

				Never heard of that rule before, how are you supposed to have 5 transactions if you can&#039;t purchase anything. Bit of a paradox.
