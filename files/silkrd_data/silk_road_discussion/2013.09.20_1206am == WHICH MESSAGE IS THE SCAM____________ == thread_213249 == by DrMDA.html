				I just got this message from &quot;Vendor Support&quot;:<br /><br />&quot;Dear DrMDA,<br /><br />This is an automated message to all sellers at Silk Road :<br /><br />there have been a couple of scam messages going around that I&#039;m aware of. One from &quot;S I L K R O A D&quot; (notice the spaces) and one from &quot;VEND0R SUPP0RT&quot; (notice zeros instead of O&#039;s and all-caps).<br /><br />You should ignore these messages.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road Vendor Support&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Were the other messages scams or is this message the scam???? I DON&#039;T KNOW WHAT TO DO!!! This letter said the other guy was using zeros instead of O&#039;s but what if this guy is just using lower case zeros this time and HE is the scammer trying to prevent me to deposit all my BTC in the new safe SR wallet?????? What should I do, what should I do???? I don&#039;t know who to trust! <br /><br />Quick! Someone give me a nice safe BTC wallet to transfer all my btc coins to so I can move them from my currently potentially compromised btc wallet (according to the first guy) and then if I find out later this new vendor support was telling the truth then I will just transfer them back. Quick! Before it is too late!

				Jimmy Saville wasn&#039;t a comedian, he was a national treasure. Its come to a sorry state of affairs when a man who &#039;fixed it&#039; for thousands of children, OBE, KCSG, who raised in excess of Â£40 million for charity, CAN&#039;T FUCK WHOEVER THE FUCK HE WANTS!<br />&nbsp;<br />as for Benny Hill we&#039;d prefer it if you didn&#039;t mention that monster.

Not saying this OP is stupid. But the scam messages he was talking about....At least 8 btc were sent to that address!!! Meaning there were members stupid enough to believe that SR would message you and ask you to send money to a BTC address!! And as long as there are stupid people..the scamming will continue.<br /><br />And these scams are not good ones. NO ONE should fall for them. NO ONE. Under no circumstances.&nbsp; And for those that did..sorry you did as I hate to hear about anyone getting scammed. And no one ever deserves it.
