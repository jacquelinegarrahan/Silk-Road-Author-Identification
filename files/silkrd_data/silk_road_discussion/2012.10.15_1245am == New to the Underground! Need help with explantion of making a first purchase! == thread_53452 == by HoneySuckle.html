				All you have to do is this:&nbsp; Go back to the main page for the SR.&nbsp; In the top right corner of the screen it will say &quot;A few words from the Dread Pirate Roberts&quot;.&nbsp; Click there and all of your questions will be answered.&nbsp;

You would be better off looking at the Account-area of your SR account and copying down the bitcoin address it lists.<br /><br />Then go to BitInstant.com and select the bank deposit option, put in the amount of cash you have available that you want to buy bitcoins with, and... follow their steps from there.<br /><br />That covers your first question.<br /><br />2) No exchange will accept paypal, because paypal has a strong history of immediately undoing any transfer of funds should the buyer of bitcoins claim to have never received it.<br /><br />3) A bitcoin wallet is, technically speaking, a collection of the cryptographic private-keys used in determining the ownership of a particular bitcoin address. Less technically, it&#039;s where all your bitcoins are stored.<br /><br />4) No, but there is a thread created by shroomiester that is a great help.

				And here&#039;s that thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36048.0<br /><br />So... really, Shroomeister should be the one who gets the 10btc. But I wouldn&#039;t mind a little thanks as well. ;)

				i&#039;m just gonna say that if you&#039;re looking for really &quot;dirty&quot; E tabs, you&#039;ve come to the wrong place....SR has some of the cleanest rolls I&#039;ve ever had...no meth bombs here...even the non-MDMA pills are made purely of one substance...<br /><br />however...the Defqons seemed a bit speedy but my Marquis test was pure purple/black...

				read the SR wiki it should answer any question you have: dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />im sure you didnt know, 10 bitcoins is around 120 dollars, so thats a little much -&nbsp; but since you said you would pay whoever helped you, it would be right of you to at least send BlarghRawr a coin or two at least when you get them. plus if you have any other questions im sure he will be happy to help you if you follow through with your word as you should<br /><br />under your account tab just type in his name &quot;BlarghRawr&quot; under where it says send coins to another user, then the amount of coins, followed by the second password you created called a pin - and send away to thank him for his assistance. he deserves it <br /><br />
