				I will shortly buy for 1st time on SR. I have seen advice that most sellers like to see a record of purchases from a customer. The usual advice is to build this up by buying cheap items from such as Digital Goods etc. Why is this necessary? I am unable to find an answer to this otherwise I would not trouble the forum.<br />Is it not the case that anyone, nefarious or otherwise, can do this construction of a buying record? What does it prove? Why should a seller be worried if they are anonymous to the buyer?<br />Maybe I am not seeing something here!<br />I want to buy and am prepared to forego this escrow business, if necessary.<br />Can someone clear this up for me?<br />Regards

				I say <br />1. find a vendor with a good rep. with small quantities of what you seek. <br /><br />2.Place a order.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.Follow the rules they place on new buyer(most rep. vendor have special instructions for new / poor stat buyers)<br />said to say it might mean FE (Finalizing early) for your first couple orders<br /><br />4 receive and check goods finalize so the good vendor gets their money.<br /><br />5. enjoy you goods<br /><br />6.and repeat as necessary until step 3 becomes unnecessary<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I always suggest having some communication with a vendor prior to placing the order. Some vendors may not respond, but i think for the first few orders it is important for you to feel at ease before placing money on the line. By speaking beforehand, you can gain a solid understanding of what to expect, so you aren&#039;t freaking out at the mailbox every day waiting for the package to arrive. <br /><br />Depending on what you are looking for, and if its something you would buy again, you may ask for the next order to be in escrow as a repeat client. Never hurts to ask and the worst that happens is they say no! You may wish to try a newer vendor as well who has less transactions but it showing positive results. Try to work within the comf<br /><br />HeyOItsMe2 said it best, start small. You can get excited and easily spend hundreds of bitcoins ( if you have it available) rather quick. Take your time, and most important, ENJOY.

				I really dont understand why people suggest buying cheap digital goods to start off with. I am pretty new and have just started out small transactions (7-10BC). You will build your stats and in the meantime gain some cred on the forums while waiting for your package to arrive. Not only have I become more comfortable with buying, sellers have probably become more comfortable selling seeing my transaction history.

				I just made my first order and the vendor did not give me any hassle whatsoever. It has not arrived yet but when it does i&#039;ll be sure to finalize right away and give a good feedback. If a vendor will not sell to anyone who doesn&#039;t have xy and z in a row, then look for someone else. <br /><br />I realize there are scam buyers as well as scam sellers though a new buyer is more suspect than a new seller since the seller has some skin in the game, $150 worth of skin. If you are worried about le then buying over $100 worth does not prove a thing. Cops and dea have big budgets and can easily spend $1000 or more on an operation. As long as the vendor follows strict guidelines they have no worries. The bitcoins are shuffled, from what i hear and unless the vendor makes a blunder he/she will not give up any info. Its the buyer who is giving up info.<br /><br />Of course a scammer could be out just to get free or discounted goods so i can see caution for that reason. But if someone is making buys and is not making a huge buy after a few tiny ones, it should be ok. You can always use a dcn and charge the buyer for it. Then you have no risk that i can see. The buyer takes all the risk.<br /><br />The ones who treat me decent while i&#039;m new will be the ones i go to first even when i have 50 transactions.

It seems like new buyers that do not reply to a vendors question also do not come back and finalize. This makes the vendor wait over half a month to get the money out of escrow.

				2 0f the first 5 transactions claimed they never got goods.<br />That was entirely my fault as I had no system in place and i was stupid by Not using DCN.<br /><br />I then set set hardline policies and it;s been fine..few transactions, but I only deal with creme dela creme of Buyers now.

				aside from digital goods (which dont really make your stats very impressive) you could purchase a couple smaller legal items (tobacco pipes, salvia (if its still legal in your area), etc) and keep your eyes open for new buyer friendly sellers, who usually advertise as being so. i was actually impressed with how accomidating and friendly these sellers were to me as a new buyer (and another potential scammer). once you move a few bitcoins you will be trusted. ive never finalized early, just couldnt get whatever i wanted from the start.

				I am brand new to this entire endeavor. I just created a Bitcoin Exchange account through Mt.Gox, and I&#039;m curious as to how I acquire Bitcoins to start with. Since I&#039;m still skeptical of this whole process, I don&#039;t want to link my bank account and simply transfer funds right off the bat.

				All this has pretty much been said but just buy something you like that&#039;s small for a few purchases. I don&#039;t do anything special, just don&#039;t be ignorant of how the system works. Send them your address encrypted and place your small time order. Nobody has really given me any problems. I haven&#039;t needed to FE any. One guy asked me to and I said no thanks and he canceled my order all quick and easy. Everyone else has processed me thus far. <br /><br />Cheers and good luck

				Only way you are getting BC is through an online site or someone here on SR. Check the beginner&#039;s thread and read all through that. bitinstant has lots of easy ways to turn cash into BC. Mtgox is often suggested as the site to get your coins sent through. It&#039;s not hard after you try it once:<br /><br />Set up mtgox/other trusted site account &gt;&gt; bitinstant cash deposit via whatever store is close to you (bitinstant will suggest some) &gt;&gt; trade cash for BC via mtgox &gt;&gt; send BC from mtgox to a tumbler or ten &gt;&gt; send BC to SR.<br /><br />These are the basic steps that many new users do. Look at the thread, the sites, and do your homework. Protect yourself and others. Enjoy.<br /><br />
