				I was adding new listings and calculating their display price but I kept getting it wrong. Then I realized that the commission fee has been raised from 6.25% to 9%. <br /><br />There&#039;s no announcement about this increase on the front page or in the forum. Anybody know what&#039;s going on?<br /><br />UPDATE: I messaged SR Support about the price change and he replied: &quot;We did change it briefly, but it is back to how it was before now. We are going to make a few changes, but you will be made aware before we do next time.&quot;<br /><br />So we can all relax for the time being. :)

				Do you use hedging? If so then that&#039;s an additional 4% so instead of 6.25 it&#039;d be 10.25 which is pretty close to the 9 that you&#039;re suggesting. If you&#039;re not using hedged then yeah, commission might have gone up and I&#039;d like to see SR confirm or deny it.

				I honestly don&#039;t mind SR taking 10%, though it&#039;d be nice to get an update, especially for those trying to calculate custom listings.<br /><br />At the very least the price hike will send more business to the Black Market or other markets and disperse traffic more evenly across the darknet, making it that much more difficult for LE to conduct effective ops.<br /><br />More likely though it&#039;ll give SR the resources needed to more effectively fight off LE

				Hey SR, how about work on having the site up consistently before you even THINK about raising the fees...<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m tired of getting shit from customers and losing BTC because the site is down. I lost hundreds in escrowed BTC to the hedge last time the site conveniently went down as the price of BTC went up. I was unable to process orders for nearly 3 days. Totally unacceptable in my book. This has been happening multiple times a month and its almost as if its a regular thing now that SR will go down (with little if any explanation) every couple weeks or so. If anything the fee should be going down.<br /><br /><br />What has SR done that even almost warrants a fee increase? <br /><br /><br />More and more people are going to be doing direct payments if there is a higher commission, thus bypassing the fee all together. The trusted vendors will still be making their money fine, but SR will be losing their commission due to greed. <br /><br /><br />There WILL be SR contenders soon. I personally know of some that are being developed right now. There ARE security flaws on SR that jeopardize buyers. <br /><br /><br />If the SR team doesn&#039;t get their shit together and treat the user base better, then they&#039;re gonna get left in the dust. Its as simple as that. They have a lot of work to do before they should even consider a raise.<br /><br />/rant

				I do not care what the % is. I am going to set my price at what I want and trade it. I will look at the end price sure. Bottom line, I have to get mine, SR is getting his and the buyer gets what they want to there door. And usually it is something exotic or high quality for the buyers area. Whatever it is. I buy on site. Yeah, I find some things over priced (but available) . Sometimes I buy them for one reason or another. I do not care. I am VERY happy that it is available. No matter the final price. <br /><br />I just want an audio option and a MORE secure SITE! I always want that though.&nbsp;

				We may have an idea what revenue might be, but I think we have very little idea of what expenses are, and opportunity cost as someone mentioned.<br /><br />Just because a business needs more revenue to operate effectively doesn&#039;t equal greed. Greed is a big word. If they do raise commission, wait to see if the money is well spent back into the business before labeling someone greedy.<br /><br />Someone mentioned increasing uptime before raising commission... maybe a raised commission is NEEDED to increase uptime.<br /><br />Truth be told, if I was the operator of this place, I wouldn&#039;t dream of doing it if I wasn&#039;t making 10% of every single bitcoin that went through.<br /><br />And I don&#039;t know what its like for other people, but I don&#039;t have a f2f connect with as much diversity and quality product as this site offers. The prices are very competitive for what I need in my world. I would gladly pay a middle man 10% of proceeds for the ultimate connection.

				From all I&#039;ve heard as well as Fees..I&#039;m probably just going to be a Consumer up until point I have to mortgage my home. I would Not At all mind &quot;Donating&quot; for a particular Status Ranking as a Buyer. Eg. If I habe 10 or more Purchases, No Hassles, No Refunds, I could Pay $25 for Silver, $35 as an example for Gold and $50+ for Platinum. Buyer should be part of the Cost here to Help Keep Costs Down. Also, if your a Legit regular Buyer and youve Paid a Memebership, it&#039;s less Likely ur going to do something Stupid. As I always say, I just hang out here..but I&#039;m willing to do My Part

I would Not At all mind &quot;Donating&quot; for a particular Status Ranking as a Buyer. Eg. If I habe 10 or more Purchases, No Hassles, No Refunds, I could Pay $25 for Silver, $35 as an example for Gold and $50+ for Platinum. Buyer should be part of the Cost here to Help Keep Costs Down. Also, if your a Legit regular Buyer and youve Paid a Memebership, it&#039;s less Likely ur going to do something Stupid. As I always say, I just hang out here..but I&#039;m willing to do My Part<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Don&#039;t buyers pay WAY more than sellers? Sellers pay a one time fee right? Buyers pay the 6% escrow on every single purchase. Seems like if you were gonna increase fees, you&#039;d charge the seller more. Maybe a listing fee.<br /><br />Of course, any fees imposed on the seller would have them just include that cost in the product cost (raise prices) and again the buyer would be paying for it.<br /><br />But with that being said, let me say Buyer Statuses I think are a good idea. Like you said, if you invested $100 in a platinum membership or whatever, people would definitely think you&#039;re less likely to be a scammer. Seems like a no-brainer really. Good for vendors, good for buyers, more money for SR.

				Seems like too they would delete the &quot;Out of Escrow Feedback&quot; items on SR. It would make people more likely to use escrow and thus increase fees.<br /><br />Of course, that&#039;s a businessman&#039;s point of view. Maybe he has much more noble reasons to run SR than money.
