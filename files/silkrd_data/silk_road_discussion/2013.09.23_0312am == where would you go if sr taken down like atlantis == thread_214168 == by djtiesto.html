				Ya I wonder what the status is of BMR these days.&nbsp; A lot of people have a lot of things riding on the reliability of SR (especially vendors and RL re-sellers) so hopefully there are already some other teams working on competing websites at the moment.&nbsp; As a web developer myself I&#039;ve considered jumping in on this sort of thing but unfortunately I know very little about TOR and web-security, in particular.

Some are undoubtedly scams, but I&#039;m led to believe some are legit, so might try one or two...

				go to do what? buy? sell? SR is a great platform but if tor was no more then we could still operate on a clearnet forum using public wifi. The real revolution here wasnt tor, it was bitcoin.
