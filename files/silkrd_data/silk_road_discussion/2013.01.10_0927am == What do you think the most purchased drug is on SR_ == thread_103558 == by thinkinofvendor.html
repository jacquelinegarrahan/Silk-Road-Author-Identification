				If I wanted to make the most profits I could, it would probably be to stock the most popular drug purchased on SR, what do you guys think it is?<br /><br />Ice? Heroin? Weed? E pills?

				Hard to estimate, really.&nbsp; You mean by how much is being moved, by how many purchases, or what...?<br /><br />Just look at &quot;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/70&quot; if you want to see the top selling drugs.&nbsp; The first four most popular drug listings on SR are for ketamine, cocaine, LSD, and meth.

And even if you&#039;d pick one, for example NL, then it would depend on a timeframe.<br />A few years back mdma was really popular. Don&#039;t know what it is now.<br /><br />Weed would seem silly to me. But that&#039;s because I can just go to a coffeeshop and buy some for 70% less money than on SR.<br /><br />My bet would be coke mdma and benzo&#039;s.<br /><br />This should be a question asked by SR. The person who has the answer closest to the truth would win something.<br />1x price x, 5x price b, 10x c and 50x d&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />
