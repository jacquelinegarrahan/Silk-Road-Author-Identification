				I think its a great idea. It still won&#039;t stop the 20 same threads about items like when mybitcoin had any news. It seemed like no one takes the time to read or search. Maybe if all the threads were gone through and combine all the alike threads and then stickied the important how to&#039;s/topics or whatever and Whenever someone makes a new thread it gets merged to the sticky or just deleted..<br /><br />It would be a lot more work. but having a FAQ page would be helpful, but it will only help if people take the time to read...

				I&#039;m willing to contribute.&nbsp; Maybe we should make a thread with common questions people ask when they first join.&nbsp; My first questions when joining were:<br /><br />1. How to install and use Tor<br />2. How to use PGP<br />3. How to acquire bitcoins

				i apologize if this question is not in the right place and/or if it&#039;s stupid, but i don&#039;t understand the whole pgp thing.&nbsp; i sent a message through the SR site to a seller without any kind of encryption.&nbsp; my question is does it matter?&nbsp; the way i see it, if sellers can post about their products and provide pics, etc then surely me asking questions about their products, acceptable payment options, and shipping should be fine, right (even if i don&#039;t encrypt it)?<br /><br />thanks for any clarification i get on this issue.

				Creating a complete guide will help members not get caught, which is good for SR.<br /><br />But in the case that law enforcement discovers this wiki, they will know how we operate and can use that against us....<br /><br />
