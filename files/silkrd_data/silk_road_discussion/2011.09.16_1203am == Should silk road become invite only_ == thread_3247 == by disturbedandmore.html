				This is just me, but dont you think silk road invite only would be alot safer so you cant just have anyone join? now im not really sure how this would work but considering how advertised silk road has become and now ANYONE can join. I think to keep this place safer it would be smart to do this. Now its probably been considered before and I dont know all the complications but let me know what you guys think.

				This has been discussed often, and generally comes down to this: you weren&#039;t invited, so why the desire to cut out others like you?<br />I certainly wouldn&#039;t be here if invitation were required, and I&#039;m sure a lot of SR folks wouldn&#039;t.<br />Sure, it might add another layer of &quot;safety&quot; to the process, but it also would cut way down on the amount of vendors and legit buyers. Fewer buyers -&gt; smaller market -&gt; fewer vendors -&gt; fewer products and less variety -&gt; far less awesome SR.

				I&#039;ve said it in another thread and will repeat it here but if SR was invite only then I definitely wouldn&#039;t have gotten an invite.<br /><br />I have very few &#039;drug&#039; friends in real life and even fewer (none) on the net so SR is a total god-send for me. I am a totally legit buyer and am more than happy to pay a little extra for the convenience and wide choice of items that I would simply not have access to IRL.<br /><br />If peeps want to create a separate entity and make it invite only then I say go for it but please don&#039;t take my SR away. :)

				The other thread is better to carry on this conversation:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2550.0<br />Its on the front page, I&#039;m curious as to how you missed it.<br /><br />

				I agree with enddox... I wouldnt have got an invite. <br /><br />Personally, I only do drugs occasionally.... but the price and low quality in australia means there really isnt a point bothering locally anymore. WHen I heard about this place I thought it was fkn xmas. Finally able to get some decent gear and go to some trance gigs. YES! (yeh..... im pretty high right now infact)

				Absolutely not.&nbsp; Pretty much none of us, sellers or buyers, would be here.&nbsp; In 6 months, SR has built five times the site that the other invite-only guys have built in years.<br /><br />I want this to be big.&nbsp; It gets the philosophical message across and to me that&#039;s more important than making the money - the state is a force for destruction in our lives.&nbsp; People are capable of interacting peacefully in a completely private setting.&nbsp; It benefits society when they do.&nbsp; A world without initiated violence (or at least a structure that minimizes its possiblity) is a better world, one where we are healther, richer, live longer, and can do things every day that previous generations never even dreamed of.

				Seriously .... No, no, no, and no.<br /><br />The whole idea of Silk Road is that it *ISN&#039;T* invite only. There are other places and forums that are invite only that neither you or I know about or are involved in, even though we may be reputable and stand up folk, we just don&#039;t happen to know the people who are involved in the forums. Thus we can&#039;t be verified. Thus we aren&#039;t invited.<br /><br />The thing I love about Silk Road is that it is open to all. Anybody can join. That&#039;s the idea. It&#039;s free and open access. <br /><br />Plus there is no need for invite only forums when using bitcoin.<br /><br />If you can have it open like this, and it doesn&#039;t get busted, then why make it private?
