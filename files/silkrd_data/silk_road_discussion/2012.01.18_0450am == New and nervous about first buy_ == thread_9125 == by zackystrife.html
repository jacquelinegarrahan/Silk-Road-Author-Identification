				Hey guys I only found out about the site today, I&#039;m looking to buy some weed and ecstasy but I&#039;m pretty nervous about it. I was curious about what precautions i should take and if anyone can recommend sellers? So far the community looks great and I&#039;m hoping its smooth sailing from here on out.

				From what I&#039;ve gathered:<br /><br />- don&#039;t run uTorrent and Tor at the same time<br />- PGP for messages containing names and addresses<br />- use your real name and real address (treat it as if it&#039;s junk mail, and wait a few days to open it; plausible deniability)<br />- read buyer reviews<br />- bitcoin exchange &gt; wallet &gt; SR<br />- don&#039;t have any paraphernalia or drugs in house when ordering from SR<br />

				Thank you for the quick response, Seems straight forward. I&#039;m amazed that such a site exists. I&#039;m very paranoid about this stuff But I&#039;ve had a look around the forums and everyone seems really helpful. As far as i can tell you can get bitcoins from different places? Is there anywhere in particular i should be getting them from?

				The most mentioned places I see are Mtgox.com and Getbitcoin.com.<br />I personally like the Getbitcoin.com bank deposit option the most.&nbsp; You just go into a Bank of America (or Chase) branch–they usually won&#039;t ask for ID, and to be safe, go to one where tellers don&#039;t know you—fill out a deposit slip and write the Bitcoin address you get from the website, and it transfers.&nbsp; Seems like the safest way to me.

				It is okay to be a little paranoid it will keep you on your toes and doing things correct. My first buy I was a wreck walking to the mailbox. I always put it mixed up with my &quot;unsorted&quot; junk mail and write RTS ( Return to Sender) on everything I don&#039;t claim as mine.&nbsp; Be sure to learn to use PGP key correctly so you can securely send your address. Personally I used dwolla &gt; mt.gox &gt; instawallet &gt; SR account it seems to take a while for the first transaction to process, but the rest have been pretty quick. <br /><br />As others have said make sure to check the rumor mill about a certain buyer and read their reviews about the product.

				Oh also, I read the buyers guide. it says not to get it delivered to your own house or a P.O box. This is a problem for me. I don&#039;t really have anyone to send it to. Would it be a problem sending it to my own house?

				I&#039;d check out Voids writeup, I&#039;m going to read it later.<br /><br />Don&#039;t shop for price. I think thats how a lot of new guys get ripped. Look for high number of transactions for real items,from real buyers. It doesnt take too long on the forums to find out who some good vendors are.<br /><br />Don&#039;t open your mail at the PO or outside your house. keep the package for a while, and always have a stash place that no one knows about. Know how the item is being shipped, and question anything that seems wrong about its delivery (signing for package when you werent suppossed to). I have seen people go to prison after literally signing their own confessions handed to them by undercover law enforcement posing as mailmen and private couriers. I AM NOT JOKING&nbsp; (no they werent SR/TOR users, and wouldve got busted anyway,but if I didn&#039;t recognize the mailman, or was asked to sign, I&#039;d get real suspicious)<br />

				you should not order anything without first learning how to use PGP.&nbsp; you should never, ever, ever send an address in cleartext.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care how secure SR is and how much your message is protected.&nbsp; If it&#039;s just a bunch of nonsense characters that only ONE person can decrypt, you are much safer should anything go wrong.<br /><br />ideally, all communication should be in PGP form.&nbsp; poor vendors would really be overworked if that was the case though.

				sorry for the hijack, but I thought it was better than making another thread...<br /><br />To any UK/EU folk, what&#039;s the best way for a uk dude to get some BTC? To order on get-bitcoin I would have to spend over 100 dollars as I&#039;m not from the US and that&#039;s the minimum on international buys, and I don&#039;t want to spend that much just yet.<br /><br />are there any uk/eu based sites?<br /><br />and I&#039;m fairly certain I know the answer to this but wth. getting the btcs with a debit card would be a silly move right?

				Just stay chill, try not to worry too much.&nbsp; In the words of a wise person I&#039;ve met on SR, It&#039;s not healthy and it won&#039;t do you any good.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in the USA and you&#039;re white and have a clean record (I&#039;m sorry but this is the sad truth, racism is still alive and well in the judicial system) the first time they find something illegal addressed to you, they will most likely simply confiscate it.<br /><br />Keep it to personal amounts if you want to be really safe.&nbsp; If you get a controlled delivery in that case, you are almost 100% guaranteed to not be serving any time.&nbsp; You&#039;re just looking at a lot of legal fees and probation for a year or two.

				Is it correct to say that browing SR using the Tor Browser Bundle does not affect a running uTorrent at all?<br /><br />The following page mentions that a bittorrent application would have to be configured by a user before the tracker or torrent traffic would go through Tor (which is a bad idea and shouldn&#039;t be done).<br /><br />https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea

Import their public key, go to the order page, paste your public key where your address should go, encrypt your address, paste the encrypted address a few lines under your PGP key, send.<br /><br />That way they can just import your key then copy and paste and decrypt your message faster.

				And don&#039;t forget how you connect to Silk Road.&nbsp; You can use the Tor bundle for Windows, Mac, or Linux, but a safer way is to use Tails or Liberte Linux from a USB drive.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that hard to do.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;ll also need to learn how to encrypt files.&nbsp; Once you create a PGP key you&#039;ll have two parts to it: a public key which you send to others so they can use it to send you an encrypted message only you can read, and a private key which is used to decrypt these messages. NEVER give out your private key, and keep it stored in an encrypted file.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally, select a very long and complex password for your PGP key, and a another long and complex password for the file you&#039;ve encrypted.&nbsp; All this will help you stay a little safer.
