				So I placed an order with a vendor and fairly quickly afterwards something came up personally and I decided I wanted to cancel the order.&nbsp; I messaged him explaining and I didn&#039;t hear anything at all.&nbsp; After 3 days of processing, now the order is in transit.&nbsp; I&#039;m kind of upset that he didn&#039;t cancel it like I asked.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m SOL except for the fact that I will actually get what I was going to order.

				Vendors have 4 days to put your order in transit.&nbsp; If they haven&#039;t put shipped it in that timeframe and changed the status to &quot;in transit&quot; then you&#039;d be able to cancel your order after those 4 days pass.&nbsp; Since they did mark it in transit (and hopefully did actually ship it), you&#039;ll need to wait and see if you receive anything.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t, you can click on &quot;resolve&quot; and take it to the resolution center in hopes of getting some amount refunded.&nbsp; In the meantime, stay in escrow and you should be fine!

As far as the vendor not canceling the order after you asked them to.. kind of a dick move. I wouldn&#039;t use that vendor anymore in the future.

				Well I received his order and I&#039;m actually pretty happy he didn&#039;t cancel.&nbsp; Smooth transaction aside from the lack of communication.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure he just saw a ton of orders and got them all processed and forgot to check messages.
