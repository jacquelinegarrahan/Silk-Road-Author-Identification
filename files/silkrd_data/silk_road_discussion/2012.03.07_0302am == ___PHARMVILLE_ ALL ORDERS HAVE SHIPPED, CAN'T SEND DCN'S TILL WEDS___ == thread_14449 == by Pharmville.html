				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />We&#039;ve had some computer issues and I am using a computer that is not available to me all day to send you this message.&nbsp; All the orders have been shipped but I haven&#039;t been able to get into the system to confirm them.&nbsp; <br /><br />***PLEASE DO NOT CANCEL YOUR ORDER.&nbsp; WE SHIPPED 85% ON MONDAY AND THE BALANCE TODAY***<br /><br />I have someone bringing me a computer in the morning with Tor on it so that I can confirm everyone&#039;s shipment and send out DCN&#039;s.&nbsp; I am even trying still to borrow one tonight so I can send them out later. <br /><br />This is a matter of trust, and I am sorry that we haven&#039;t been able to get you the info.&nbsp; You know that we do what we say and if your orders were not shipping I would tell you.<br /><br />Thanks for your patience and either late tonight or before noon tomorrow everyone will have their DCN&#039;s from Mon. and Tues in hand.&nbsp; Provided the SR is up.&nbsp; At the moment it appears to be down.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I assure you that you will get your DCN tomorrow moring as long as SR is up and running.<br /><br />thanks,<br />Alex &amp; Ben<br /><br />

				Told y&#039;all there was nothing to worry about. Pharmville&#039;s the best. <br /><br />Thanks for the update in any event. <br /><br />Hope you get that computer you need. I know the feeling. Mine went belly up last week. And just before I was gearing up to order from you. Luckily I had a spare to dust off I could configure in the nick of time. Old school kit running some first gen dual core. It&#039;s sad. But it worked.

				I had complete faith that everything was ok.&nbsp; I somehow have received some of your packages so quickly my past self received them.&nbsp; That bastard needs to stop mooching my candy.&nbsp; In all seriousness, may I borrow the schematics for your time machine?<br /><br />The longest wait in the entire process with Pharmville seems to be the time the mailman takes to make his way down my side of the street.&nbsp; The scary thing is this is only &quot;Pharmville 4.0.&quot;&nbsp; Rumor has it 5.0 will be able to teleport your package directly into your stash box.<br /><br />I&#039;m bummed I ordered before you stocked the alprazolam; I would have allocated some coin towards those.&nbsp; I hope they will be a regular item in your stock.&nbsp;

				I had faith and was rewarded; mine is out for delivery right now&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I got my shipping confirmation from Alex minutes after seeing this last night.<br /><br />As excited as a kid on Christmas eve. Keep up the excellent work! I think I speak for everybody when I say we appreciate all you do for the SR community. Thank you!<br /><br />oxyhoot
