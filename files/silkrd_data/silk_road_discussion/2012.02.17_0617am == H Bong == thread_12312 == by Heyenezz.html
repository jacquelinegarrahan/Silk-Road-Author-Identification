				I&#039;m thinking of making a &quot;bong&quot; for smoking H.<br /><br />Basically, I&#039;d cut out the bottom of a small plastic soda bottle, curl some foil around the bottom with the heroin on an indentation in the foil, put a carb near the top of the bottle (the bottle cap would be screwed on), and attach a straw through a hole near the bottle top. <br /><br />I&#039;d then move the foil bottom over a lit candle, melting and vaporizing the heroin, while covering the carb and straw hole. Once enough smoke built in the chamber, I&#039;d suck the straw and then release the carb.<br /><br />&nbsp;I smoked H once but didn&#039;t get high for some reason.<br /><br />How does my plan sound?

				First off, if you are going to smoke heroin, you need to make sure your heroin was made for smoking. You need to get some of psilocin&#039;s #3 or some tar. #3 is freebase and has a lower vaporization temp, compared to the salt #4 (wumg, tony, stamps) which will degrade before it begins to vaporize, which is one reason why you may not have gotten high. Smoking has an excellent bioavailability, beat only by IV, and will certainly produce a strong experience if performed correctly with decent dope.<br /><br />The second reason is you must use the proper technique to maximize the vaporization points rather than simply trying to melt it and burn it in one place, causing the molecules to combust or deacetylize which is another reason you may not have achieved the expected experience. You need to start the product on the higher side while tilting the foil slightly, then heat until it starts to literally run down the incline and chase it with the heat, catching the smoke produced during the process. Once you reach the other side, tilt reversed and chase back the opposite direction. This will maximize the smoke produced, and waste the least amount. <br /><br />Your idea is very clever, however, for the last reason, I unfortunately do not believe your proposed device will work well. I just think your area to allow the running will be too minimal. Good luck though if you decide to try. <br />- miRNA<br /><br />

				It&#039;s worth a try...&nbsp; But there are reasons people &quot;chase the dragon&quot; instead of making heroin bongs. :)<br /><br />Personally, I think any heroin not injected is a waste of heroin, but that&#039;s another topic entirely...
