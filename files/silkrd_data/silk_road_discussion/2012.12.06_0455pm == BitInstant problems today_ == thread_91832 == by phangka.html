				I&#039;ve been trying to make a deposit today and I keep getting a &#039;500 - Internal Error&#039; message when I hit the &#039;send funds&#039; button.&nbsp; &nbsp;The error is showing up on a BitInstant page so I figured the problem may be on their end.&nbsp; Still no response from support.<br /><br />Anyone else having problems with it?

				BitInstant always has some problems here and there.<br /><br />I had some problems before at the CVS when I was doing a cash deposit.<br /><br />Just try to find a different person on Bitcointalk.org to supply you with bitcoins.

				&nbsp;&gt;:( :( :&#039;(<br /><br />I was just about to make a deposit today, DAMMIT!!!!!!!<br />I even have my slip printed out, but now I&#039;m afraid to go to CVS to do the moneygram thing if they&#039;re &quot;having issues&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m so damn sick of Bitinstant. It&#039;s really convenient, but I should have been using this time to find someone locally who I can get my BTC from.<br />It just sucks having to synch with someone else, whereas CVS is always open.<br /><br />What is everyone else using?<br />When I say everyone else, I mean people who are as lazy as me and really value convenience.

				I recently had problems with bitinstant at walmart when I was sending cash. I did it 2 times in one day. Both times there was something strange that happened. Neither time would the cash register pop open for the cashier and there was a long delay till it printed my Reference # receipt. None the less, the fist time I did it, the money made it to my market account in 20 mins. The second time, I had to actually contact bitinstant and speak to &quot;Rachel&quot; who said she would be the only person answering the phone that day. Had to call 2 times to get problem fixed. Good advice to everybody, ALWAYS COPY PASTE all that info that Bitinstant gives you before you proceed to push the &quot;cash&quot; button!!!

				My experience with BitInstant has been about 50/50.<br /><br />It seems half the time there is some sort of problem. Either the Moneygram won&#039;t go through to ZipZap, or the bitcoins don&#039;t get deposited until days later after I&#039;ve contacted tech support.<br /><br />It is a cool service, but they have a long way to go before they are can be considered dependable.

				Not to mention they no longer have the &quot;Bank Cash Deposit&quot; option.&nbsp; Now I have to make up multiple fake names to go through Wal-Mart / Zip Zap.&nbsp; Ultimately I&#039;m thinking finding someone local is the best way to do it.<br /><br />Let&#039;s hope this isn&#039;t about MoneyGram or Zip Zap feeling the heat from the Feds and deciding to abandon the community.
