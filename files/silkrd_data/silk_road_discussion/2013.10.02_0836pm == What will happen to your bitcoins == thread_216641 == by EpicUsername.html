				So I suppose this goes without saying but we really need as many opinions as we can get on this. <br />What will be happening to the bitcoins still up on the road? So many of us have lost ridiculous amounts, what do you all reckon will happen? Lost forever, admin restored, back to our wallets? And what about for those still escrow...

				The DEA will cash it out to buy coke from the Colombians and will fly it over here with the help of the FBI to sell it to kids who they will bust to feed the prison industrial complex and its rotating door politicians.

				I thought the site was set up to where if something happened it would send your BTC to the address you left for them to be delivered to ?&nbsp; When I saw the sign on the site I checked my wallet and had almost 3k in BTC there which I only had $50 when I went to bed , so I sent it to another wallet instantly , but it was a false reading some how. It even let me send the false coins out , but did not register on transactions , So i reset my wallet and there was only 50 dollars as when I went to sleep .&nbsp; I hope it wasnt a bug of some sort from the feds I.T. department

				The US government just got control of a HUGE portion of the existing BTC. 26k my ass, more like 2.6m if anything - dollar crashes swap to BTC&nbsp; and the usdebtclock is back on track for the first time since I was born.

Some good hacker who would come and save everyone. But SuperHacker probably doesn&#039;t exist. I&#039;m hoping the other people who ran this site with DPR have some sort of contingency/back up plan. Maybe the original DPR can come back and help his throttled revolution.

				Didn&#039;t dpr say that he is the only one with the passwords for all the coins held on SR even if the Feds shutdown the site won&#039;t they need the passwords to do anything with the coins? Guess that means there just going to sit there that is if dpr doesn&#039;t crack
