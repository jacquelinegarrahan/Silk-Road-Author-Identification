				Figured I would post this here before the listing goes up in the main section.&nbsp; Come to your own conclusions but I smell bullshit<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=201549.0

				If I remember correctly, selling a vendor account is allowed, but yeah, I wouldn&#039;t buy it from him...<br /><br />EDIT: Talked to him via pm for awhile. Changed my mind lol, actually considering buying this off of him in the couple days.

				You know, it really wasn&#039;t necessary to do this. There&#039;s a thread that the vendor is advertising this in already and you already complained and said he was a scammer.

				Finally hit 50! <br /><br />Ok so I just came to say, I can see why Swimfan has jumped to conclusions and honestly, I am happy to see this community look after each other. <br />If anybody does want this vendor account that I have no use for for then pm me and we will work out a way to keep everything safe (Possibly use a payed for middle man?).<br /><br />

				I forgot to mention, once the account gets over $1,500 sold, it will be eligible to get the 4.8btc (or so) bond back.

				I would like to apologize to you TeamGB for my rum fueled tirade.&nbsp; I have a tendency to be grandiose when I drink and I was very belligerent.&nbsp; Anyone who can stay cool, calm, and collected while dealing with an asshole like me shouldn&#039;t be selling their vendor account, they should keep it because we need more people like that here.<br /><br />You are right CannabisCrusader in the fact that people are free to sell their vendor accounts here and I fully supported this when I first saw the thread.&nbsp; The account was created 2 months ago and there were 0 stats so everything looked legit.&nbsp; Heck, for the price it was being sold at, it was a steal.&nbsp; And this is where the huge red flags started to go up.&nbsp; All of a sudden, in a matter of an hour, the account mysteriously had 1 transaction associated with it where there had been none before.&nbsp; Also, the listing to sell the account was still there.&nbsp; It is very rare that a listing goes up and has a sale in that short of a time.&nbsp; In my mind this could only mean 2 things.&nbsp; The first being the account was sold already, the buyer finalized, and then things weren&#039;t turned over and the listing was put back up.&nbsp; TeamGB even said in their other post that they have other accounts.&nbsp; Using one of the other seller accounts would have provided full escrow and this point wouldn&#039;t exist.&nbsp; The second thing it could be was the seller posting fake transactions which could later get the account banned like Bruce&#039;s did a couple&nbsp; of days ago.<br /><br />The reason I posted this thread cyberscour was because I didn&#039;t see the other thread while browsing the recent unread posts and TeamGB looked like they were trying to get to 50 posts so they could post in the main section.&nbsp; I wanted to make sure people were aware of everything involved before they potentially made a mistake.<br /><br />I hope I am wrong in my assumptions for the sake of TeamGB and the person who buys this.

				You have nothing to apologize for. That&#039;s exactly how we keep each other safe here...<br /><br />I&#039;ve parted with that account and I think the new owner will be using it way better than I did! <br /><br />Looks like they&#039;re Herbalists :D<br /><br />Anyway I was tripping bawls when all of that other stuff was being posted, maybe that made me more suspicious haha!<br /><br />Peace guys and stay safe!
