				I don&#039;t think I am being scammed.<br /><br />I am not going to name the vendor because they are very good and I think it might be a USPS problem or something....<br /><br />My regular vendor has been really swamped lately and is struggling to keep up.&nbsp; I am worried because I read about vendors dissapearing or whartever when they get too much business and can&#039;t keep up.&nbsp; <br /><br />They resent the 1st order that did not make it in with the second.&nbsp; It has now been 10 days since the second order was placed.&nbsp; In the past it only took 3 days to get a package from this vendor, and the posted by date has shown it only ever takes a maxc of 4 days to mail.<br /><br />Really worried that it is never going to get here, the vendor assures me that it was mailed and they can&#039;t remember the exact date.&nbsp; They thing maybe Tuesday of last week.&nbsp; Even if it was mailed Thursday it should be here already, and on Wednesday he was saying it should arrive soon...<br /><br />Do I just ask for a refund through the resolution center and find a new vendor?&nbsp; Or should I give it a few more days?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Which seller is it? the whole point of the forums is to discuss these issues. I would take the order into the resolution center after the 17 days are up if i were you

				I don&#039;t want to say what seller it is because I don&#039;t think it is something that they are doing wrong.&nbsp; They may be a little overwhelmed, but until I have a bad experience I don&#039;t want to call them out or throw them under the bus.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have extended the time in the resolution center already.&nbsp; I have decided to wait another day or two and see if it arrives.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t come after 12 days then at least I know it isn&#039;t coming.
