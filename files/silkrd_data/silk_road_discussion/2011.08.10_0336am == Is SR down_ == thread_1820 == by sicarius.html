This server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server it accessed to deal with your HTTP request.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This usually means that the upstream server is down (no response to the gateway/proxy), rather than that the upstream server and the gateway/proxy do not agree on the protocol for exchanging data.<br /><br />Fixing 504 errors - general<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This problem is entirely due to slow IP communication between back-end computers, possibly including the Web server.

This server received an invalid response from an upstream server it accessed to fulfil the request.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This usually does not mean that the upstream server is down (no response to the gateway/proxy), but rather that the upstream server and the gateway/proxy do not agree on the protocol for exchanging data. Given that Internet protocols are quite clear, it often means that one or both machines have been incorrectly or incompletely programmed.<br /><br />Fixing 502 errors - general<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This problem is due to poor IP communication between back-end computers, possibly including the Web server at the site you are trying to visit. Before analysing this problem, you should clear your browser cache completely.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are surfing the Web and see this problem for all Web sites you try to visit, then either 1) your ISP has a major equipment failure/overload or 2) there is something wrong with your internal Internet connection e.g. your firewall is not functioning correctly. In the first case, only your ISP can help you. In the second case, you need to fix whatever it is that is preventing you reaching the Internet. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you get this problem for only some of the Web sites you try to visit then it is likely to be a problem at those sites i.e. one of their pieces of equipment is failing/overloaded. (DO NOT Contact the people at those sites,....SR given example :)<br /><br />Layman&#039;s terms? Maintenance of some sort. As to where the maintenance takes place?

So do I have a limited time to use those btc before my ewallet expires or something like that? I ask because i have to go to work for 8 hours soon. Just thought i read something like that.
