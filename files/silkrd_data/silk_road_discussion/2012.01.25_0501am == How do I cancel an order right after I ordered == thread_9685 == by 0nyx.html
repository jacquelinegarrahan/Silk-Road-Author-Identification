				Ok, I&#039;m new to SR and I made my first order minutes ago. I made the noobie mistake to fall in a scammer&#039;s trap, I ordered from jabberwockylover who sells MDMA, and by searching the forums I just realised it&#039;s pretty obvious he&#039;s a scammer. I want to cancel my order right away and get my bitcoins, how do I do that? SR&#039;s website tells me the cancel feature will be available in 4days for my order.

				I hope you didn&#039;t finalize early or you can&#039;t. If you don&#039;t know what I mean, you should not have yet clicked &quot;Finalize&quot; at any time during the purchase. If you did, tough luck. Next time do your research and only finalize early for the most trusted sellers on the site. But if you were smart and didn&#039;t, you can simply go to your account in 4 days, click on &quot;Orders,&quot; and you should see the ability to cancel that order.

				I did not finalize early, as I can&#039;t before the seller process my order. I would like to cancel it now to buy something else with my bitcoins, but it seems like I have to wait...I contacted SR&#039;s support, maybe they can do something about it.

				Why did you order, and THEN go on to the forums to check his legitimacy? In anyway you should be fine, and should be able to cancel your order in a couple of days. Learn from your mistakes.

				While you should do your research first, is there any reason why this jabberwockylover guy still is allowed to operate?&nbsp; There&#039;s no doubt he&#039;s a scammer.

				Unfortunately you cannot cancel that fast.<br />There have been a number of scam buyers as well, so SR put certain restrictions on the accounts.<br />Even if the vendor hasn&#039;t click Finalize, they could be at the post office mailing that package when the buyer hits cancel.&nbsp; This just gives all parties time to think about what they&#039;ve done.&nbsp; LOL<br />There are only two ways to get out of the four day wait now.&nbsp; PM SR to help you, OR PM the seller and just tell him you wish to cancel your order.&nbsp; Even if he is a scammer he can&#039;t screw with you too much at this point, as you haven&#039;t finalized... though I suppose he could try to strongarm you with your address.

				You could have told the seller that you gave the wrong address and that you&#039;d like to resubmit the order with the correct one.&nbsp; Apologize for being new, make up a story for the mix up, and tell him you&#039;ll order again right away.&nbsp; Then don&#039;t re-order.<br /><br />If the vendor asks to just PM him your address, say it makes you nervous.&nbsp; When the vendor hits &quot;mailed&quot;, it deletes the address you supplied with the order.&nbsp; Tell the vendor you want to make sure it gets deleted.

				My order date was ordered: February 29, 2012, 10:01 am UTC , I just highlighted over cancel button in the order as I can not click it and it says it will be available in 2 days. Is there anyway to make it faster? Seems like 6 days is awfully long....
