				I used to use Dwolla but now they require too much identification.&nbsp; Then I used bitinstant, printed out the payment slip and went down to the bank to make the deposit.&nbsp; Coinapult sent the coins to my tor mail and it all worked great.&nbsp; But now bitinstant doesn&#039;t seem to allow you to go to any bank anymore.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried the moneygram twice and both times it was a dud.&nbsp; They can&#039;t seem to figure out how to create the order.&nbsp; Today they told me $400 was an invalid number... WTF?!?!<br /><br />So how are others getting bitcoins with cash?&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched the forums but there used to&nbsp; be a forum specific to bitcoins and now I don&#039;t see it.<br />If anyone can help find a nice anonymous way of getting coins I&#039;d appreciate it!&nbsp; If it matters, I&#039;m in the US.<br /><br />Savannah

				Have you tried the bit instant method? Bedhat wrote an amusingly informative step-by-step here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=85401.msg624411<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve read on the a forum (wish I could remember the forum) where the bitcoinfog developer was gathering some ideas and suggestions about his site. People were mentioning how a &quot;statistical analysis could be done in order to gather info, not about the bitcoin data, but about the amounts being transacted from wallet to wallet.&nbsp; In other words, what&#039;s important is to not just dump all BTC at once into silkroad, but rather in increments.&nbsp; Perhaps put your coin into bitcoinfog, and then withdraw most (not all) of that coin into SR.&nbsp; Hope this helps!

				Actually, now that I think about it, I think bitcoinfog does this for you (the incremental transactions) automatically. But if you&#039;re paranoid, like me, then you might still consider not transmitting all of your coin into SR at once.&nbsp; At any rate, bitinstant is a pretty painless and very quick method of acquiring bitcoins.&nbsp;

				BitInstant works great - but they don&#039;t accept bank deposits anymore and all of the moneygram locations I&#039;ve gone to require government identification.&nbsp; If your goal is anonymous - bitInstant is no longer the method to use.<br /><br />I have seen some people claiming they are able to deposit at some moneygram locations without ID - but they just found places with lazy workers who arent following the current regulations.<br /><br />Unfortunately the government and fraud seems to have closed down the bitinstant anonymous method.<br /><br />I have not tried Bitcopia.com yet but if you have a Wells Fargo in your area it appears they have a deposit account setup with them - which should be anonymous.&nbsp; This will probably be the next method I try.

				Use Blue Sky Traders.&nbsp; These people are AWESOME!&nbsp; There are no hidden fees, transaction fees and none of that crap. <br />They give you account info and it is like a perfect transaction.&nbsp; Only thing is, it is a little higher than lets say what Mt. Gox is for current Bit-coin prices, but not much more. <br />I would highly recommend using them for your Cash to Bit-coin transactions.&nbsp; Been using them since I joined the road and not one single problem.&nbsp; <br />http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />Good Luck. <br />Good Times.&nbsp;

				Is there any way to skip having to use the red phone?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried it twice now and both times I spend about an hour on the phone and I can never get a deposit completed.&nbsp; Last time we finally got through all my info and when I told her I wanted to xfer $400.00 she said &quot;that&#039;s an invalid number&quot;.&nbsp; WTF is that??<br /><br />What it sounds like is on bitinstant I do moneygram to cvs (or wherever).&nbsp; I print the PDF out and take it to the store.&nbsp; I tell the clerk I have a &#039;moneygram express&#039; deposit to make.&nbsp; But this is when they always tell me to use the phone.&nbsp; But if it&#039;s a moneygram express they will skip the phone process??&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t sound right but if it is I will certainly give it a try!!<br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br />Savannah

				Using the red-phone is easy....<br /><br />1) Pick up the phone and it auto-dials moneygram auto-teller<br />2) Auto teller either detects kiosk you are calling from or asks you to enter the number<br />3) You are asked to enter the deposit amount using * as decimal<br />4) It asks you for phone number or rewards number or to skip ahead (skip to step 6 if you enter phone number here.&nbsp; It can be a made up phone number you used when you setup the transaction and is just used to match up the deposit to the receiver (zipzap)<br />5) If you skipped step 4 it will ask for a receive code which is how moneygram identifies zipzap.&nbsp; Their receive code is 9611.<br />6)&nbsp; They will confirm all of the details at this point and ask you to press 1<br />7) You will be asked to enter the account number - which is generated by zipzap and is specific to your transaction<br />8 ) If account number is accepted they will instruct you to complete express payment with the teller.&nbsp; If not they will transfer you to agent and you only should have to repeat this information.<br /><br />HTH.... although I have to admit I am strongly considering blue sky traders from now on after some research over the past day.&nbsp; You have to like an exchange with a review thread on SR forums.

				ato72543, GORDENRAMSEY, <br /><br />Blue Sky Traders looks like a very intriguing alternative to how I get my coins.&nbsp; Do they (Bank of America) ask for identification during that process?&nbsp; As I understand it, Blue Sky Traders are quite sympathetic to the whole SR community.&nbsp; To me, this implies that no coin washing service, such as Bitcoinfog, would be needed.&nbsp; Would I be incorrect in making that assumption?&nbsp; Looking forward to your replies, thanks!

				Thanks for the detailed steps Hooby,<br /><br />That&#039;s exactly what I&#039;ve tried to do twice.&nbsp; The first time I went through that exact phone process and then I went to the teller and tried to pay.&nbsp; They got some error code so they called moneygram support (?) and were told there was a problem with ZipZap&#039;s account.<br /><br />The second time when I was speaking to a live person she told me 400 wasn&#039;t a real number.<br /><br />You make it sound so easy but maybe the universe is telling me to stay away from the red phone.&nbsp; I&#039;ll give it one last try tomorrow.&nbsp; Maybe 3 is my lucky number&nbsp; 8)

				I sell btc. You go to a WU. You do not ever need to show ID. Your coins go straight to your SR account so there is no wait or need to wash your coins. Also you sending money is WU&#039;s business for over 100 years. So you sending money is not raising any eyebrows are suspicious in any way at all. It also happens to be 100% legal. It takes less then 5 min and it takes me less then 1 hour to get you your coins. There is a $500 minimum. There is no max as I do 3-5k all the time. You just need to send multiple WU&#039;s. I also cover ALL fees. So if you send me $500...and WU charges you $40. I then put $540 worth of btc in your account. I have been dong this for 8 mo. Never had a problem and have the feedback to prove it. I have a listing up and all the info is in there including how you actually do it. I even give you a picture of the actual form you will need and I walk you through every step. Just go to Silk Road and look at my listings.<br /><br />

You fill out a deposit slip (Blue Sky gives you all the info for it) and hand it to a teller along with your cash. <br /><br />I just bought bitcoins this way today, my second time.&nbsp; No ID requested. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks! Might have to give this method a go soon.
