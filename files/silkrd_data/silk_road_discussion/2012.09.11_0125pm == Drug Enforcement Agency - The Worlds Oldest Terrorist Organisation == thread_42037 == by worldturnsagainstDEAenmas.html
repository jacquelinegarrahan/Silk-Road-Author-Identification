				The filth know as the DEA were founded by a racist criminal by the name of Harry S Anslinger.<br /><br />This pile of shit was a religious nutbag and corrupt as corrupt can be.<br /><br />The Catholic Church convinced old Harry S to help decriminalize the then, prohibited Alcohol (as the Catholic church runs on drunkenness &amp; child molesting, still to this very day).<br /><br />They (The Catholic Church &amp; Harry S&#039;s mob of criminals), were connected enough to convince enough of &quot;the right people&quot; to lift prohibition against Alcohol.<br /><br />As Harry S was a leading hand in the Prohibition police, he was soon to become redundant. He &amp; the Catholics decided to try to redirect the Prohibition forces onto a new number one drug menace (as Alcohol was well known then, as we are just starting to re-realize now) the deadly CANNABIS, to save Harrys bacon. The Catholics were very grateful&nbsp; to Harry S for being the driving force behind decriminalizing their precious precious Alcohol.<br /><br />So because of a &quot;pact made in Hell&quot; between the filthy drunken child molesting Catholic Church &amp; the supreme master of corrupt bastards, Harry S Anslinger, we now have worldwide &quot;Drug Prohibition&quot;.<br /><br />This disgusting, despicable event in history has thrown the world into the serious chaos that we see today.<br /><br />Now the inhuman shit who work in ANY &#039;Drug-Law-Enforecement&quot; capacity, are guilty by inheritance.<br /><br />We the people, MUST stand against the crap know as &quot;The DEA&quot; &amp; the filthy low forms of life in other countries involved in &quot;DEA Like Activities&quot;.<br /><br />I personally, Have been working on various projects aimed at hobbling DEA (and ALL drug law enforcement organizations in ALL countries), IT resources. Also, we are compiling a database of all drug law enforcement scum who have ever performed &quot;Anti Drug Actions&quot; to be placed onto a &quot;soon to be brought online&quot; website. We will have complete details of this scum, including current address details, official (and many other) pictures, and details of each individual pile of craps financial details. <br /><br />The days of &quot;The DEA&#039; are drawing to a close. We the people, simply WILL NOT FUCKING TAKE YOUR FUCKING BULLSHIT ANY LONGER DEA SCUM. PREPARE TO PAY DEARLY FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO THE WORLD!!!

				Information gets leaked from LE often from their own family members or people whos friends parents are in drug enforcement. The DEA isnt elite, they are citizens just like everyone else - information about whos in what position, addresses etc its all very dangerous for these people because they think they are anonymous or protected but they are mortal like everyone else. <br /><br />This war on drugs needs to stop, the DEA tries to lift their game and compete with drug users who respond by lifting their game, its just a never ending cycle of cat and mouse, who can outsmart who. <br /><br />Dont lose your mortality, the DEA has ruined Sasha&#039;s life, they did so much for them and they fucking backstabbed him. Lets not sink to their level.

				Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, or my figures are off, I got them from a drug counselor.<br />I may be off on the percent, but not the change in drug abuse statistics.<br /><br />Drug Abuse was studied in the 1800&#039;s. it was 4% of the population.<br />A lot of house wifes ordered their favorite drug via mail system. ;)<br />Law were enacted, still 4%<br />The drug war was engaged, still 4%.<br />But now our jails are full.<br /><br />Countries that have loosen their laws still sit at the same rate.<br /><br />The guy who ran for president, who the media wants me to forget about, said this.<br />&quot;Do you think if you made heroin legal tomorrow, everyone would try it?&quot;<br />I thought, yes.<br />Then I thought, but I can get heroin, why don&#039;t I try it?<br />Cause I know heroin users........<br /><br />That why I agree with DPR&#039;s statement, it&#039;s your responsibility to be responsible.<br /><br />
