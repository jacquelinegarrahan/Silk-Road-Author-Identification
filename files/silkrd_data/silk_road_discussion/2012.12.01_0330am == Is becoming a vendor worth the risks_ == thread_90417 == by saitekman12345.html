				Its been a while now, I&#039;ve come to the point where I&#039;m currently making the decision to become a vendor or not.<br /><br />Is it worth the risks and what should I know/be aware of?<br />-Not the risks of growing weed, but more on the SR delivery side (how to send packages anonymously, etc.)<br /><br />(If it doesn&#039;t impede any vendors privacy, can a vendor PM me how much he/she makes APROX. every month, year, etc.<br />I know you shouldn&#039;t be telling anyone what you make and all, but I really want to weigh the pros and cons of selling on SR.)<br /><br />I want to grow marijuana and sell on SR, maybe different products when the time is right but for now it&#039;s weed.<br />Any tips, info, etc. from anyone would be nice.

Not enought to make it worth your while in that market. Unless you have some weed with unicorn hair in it, that competition is pretty stiff. Best of luck nonetheless.
