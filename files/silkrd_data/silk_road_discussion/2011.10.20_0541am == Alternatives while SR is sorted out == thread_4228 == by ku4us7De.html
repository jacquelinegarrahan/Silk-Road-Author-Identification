				You&#039;d have to PM the sellers you are interested in dealing with to find out if they are willing to take something alternative.&nbsp; Honestly, most other payment methods when substance is involved are suicide, since most other ones can be traced, or anonymous ones block Tor nodes (Liberty Reserve).<br /><br />Pecunix is the only one I would even consider accepting outside of here, and that&#039;s only because no ID is required to sign up and create accounts, and everything can be done over Tor since they dont&#039; block any Tor nodes.

I would venture to say your account and coin are intact. You&#039;re just coming in on the tail end of a server issue like I did after the June crash. This isn&#039;t EBAY, it&#039;s a hard deal to keep these revolutionary sites up and secure. Remember everybody, this is an 8 month old experiment and if you look at the fine print of the internet users agreement when you first logged on to the net back in the day you will see in BOLD letters, &quot;STEVE JOBS DOES NOT AND WILL NOT GRANT ANY WARRANTIES ON THE USE OF THE INTERNET FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY OR IF THIS THING FLYS FROM THE NEWLY LABELED WORLD WIDE WEB&quot;. I guess everybody forgot this disclaimer from 1982.&nbsp; &nbsp;LOL<br /><br />Bikerbum

				LR blocks Tor proxy but does allow non-Tor proxies. And non-Tor proxies are much faster than Tor. LR is used to transfer currency, there is no need to state any reason or nature of transfer; and is much more secure, stable and faster than BTC. You don&#039;t need any name, credit card or real info to use LR. The only thing traceable is your IP, which you easily conceal with proxy.

				Of course the shitty thing about a proxy is that a proxy has a definite location.&nbsp; if LE sent a few transfers of exact amount through LR and could grab your LR IP, all they would have to do is lean on the proxy or VPN and you are cooked (they don&#039;t crack VPN&#039;s and never have, all they do is put a gun to the proxy-owner&#039;s face and they ALWAYS cave.&nbsp; This is why most VPN rings usually get busted up, not through some crazy tech work but from a good old fashioned &quot;we are going to shut you down forever if you don&#039;t give us the encryption key for that VPN and let us monitor traffic to build a case&quot; move.)<br /><br />I would feel safer with Pecunix for substance.&nbsp; LR would be a LAST resort, and it&#039;s a given that anything else is just unthinkable...

				I would say pecunix as well. Apparently they are unable to freeze accounts and as has been mentioned one can use it over tor.&nbsp; LR can be used over tor but it is hit or miss. I used to do it by switching identities on tor over and over until it let me log in. I think I was able to find newer tor nodes that were not yet blacklisted by LR for login. But yea, I have heard also that occasionally LR will freeze accounts so I would say pecunix is better. Plus there are debit cards that can be loaded with pecunix as well. Still I would be a bit concerned about dealing with anyone without the benefit of escrow. That is the best part of SR aside from the selection of tasty drugs.
