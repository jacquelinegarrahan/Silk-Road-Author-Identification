				I know that a year ago they had pain clinics all over south Florida where it was really easy to go in and get scripts for oxy, causing an epidemic and then the state to crack down and put a stop to it with now making doctors and patients log everything in a database. My question is now that Florida is out, what is the best current state/area where the hassle free pain clinics are and it&#039;s easy to get scrips for pain meds? I heard Georgia is good, but if you have an out of state license you are out of luck so it&#039;s only good for residents. I&#039;m just wondering if there is anywhere now-a-days that is anything like how Florida was a year or two ago? I would be willing to travel once a month if it mean a hassle free way to get scripts for pain meds, just for personal use so it wouldn&#039;t have to be a bunch. If you have any suggestions on areas, or specific clinics please let me know,&nbsp; and feel free to PM me if you don&#039;t want to post on the forum for any reason. Thanks in advance.

				Ha. I know a State and a Doctor in that General area that will give you anything you want. Walk in, give him $100, he asks you what you want and types it up and bam you got yourself whatever the fuck you want. Only problem is he&#039;s Chinese or something and you can&#039;t tell what he&#039;s saying. But there&#039;s not much speaking anyways. $100, tell him what you want and quantity write down your name and date of birth, and 5 min later your walking out with scripts full of whatever you asked for. I&#039;ll sell you his name and state for 20 bitcoins.
