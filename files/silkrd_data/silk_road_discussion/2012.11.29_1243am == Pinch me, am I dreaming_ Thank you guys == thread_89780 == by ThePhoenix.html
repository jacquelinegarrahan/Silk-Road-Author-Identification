				I kept the packaging from my first order for a couple of days - just marveling at it - .for me, it&#039;s still a big thrill to get a package.&nbsp; It kind of sucks not being able to tell anybody about my &quot;packages&quot; so I&#039;m glad we can share our giddy-ness on the forums.&nbsp; Congrats on your first order, ThePhoenix!&nbsp; :)

				I think it&#039;s often overlooked, but personally I think one of the greatest strengths of SR is precisely that we don&#039;t have to skulk around.&nbsp; We&#039;re here in the open in large groups discussing -- well, whatever the Hell we choose to.&nbsp; I mean technically, we&#039;re all aiding and abetting each other by being helpful and sharing tips and tactics.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, I think there&#039;s actually a case they could make to charge all of us with the same things they&#039;d charge any large organized crime organization.&nbsp; Obviously that&#039;s ridiculous and we aren&#039;t nearly as organized as it seems with so many of us... but my point is just this: don&#039;t take the power of information for granted.&nbsp; It can do incredible things.&nbsp; Like the fellow&#039;s first package he&#039;s getting.<br /><br />And we helped him learn how to do that.&nbsp; For better or worse, that&#039;s illegal.&nbsp; Obviously it shouldn&#039;t be, but I have to go take more drugs now, so if you&#039;ll excuse me...&nbsp; 8)

				My first package was amazing!!!!&nbsp; :)<br />Made an order from SA and expected it to take about 2 weeks - lo and behold I remember that Saturday morning so well. It actually took only four days to a northern destination and we were absolutely delighted and full of disbelief.<br />Yesterday 3 packages arrived - hee hee. The mail can be wonderful sometimes.

I could have traveled by foot to pick up some orders, but in the same, I have well other 300 transactions if you count both ends. That&#039;s another part of the experience here that undoubtedly, if you stick around, will experience. The waiting game. Be careful to never get complacent though. Just because you are able to sit at your computer blown off whatever it is that gets you off this time doesn&#039;t mean that they won&#039;t get the second package. I&#039;m sure you have seeing that you took the initiative to learn pgp, but make sure to perform your due diligence with every transaction as if you knew it was a snitch on the receiving end. Freedom doesn&#039;t come free unfortunately, but welcome, brother! I feel confident enough in saying that I speak for all other vendors here that the gratitude for taking your time before running to get a moneypak to place your order as fast as possible leaving all sorts of security vulnerabilities on the table. Think of that time as your small contribution to this magnificent creation dubbed, Silk Road. <br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />GYF

I live in a small coastal town and don&#039;t like dealing with the local dealers as I always seem to get fucked over cause I&#039;m an old bastard. I placed my 1st local order yesterday after finally getting some bitcoins. I made a classic noob mistake by buying the exact amount for the order but upon returning to the road the price had gone up - lesson learned. I then proceeded to fuck up again by not contacting the buyer 1st before ordering. Any tips on site etiquette would be much appreciated.<br /><br />I actually found out about this on a local current affairs program!! Many thanks to the media for the enlightenment. :)<br /><br />I still cannot believe this works so I am very excited about my 1st order. Now I can smoke to my hearts content and nobody needs to know - I like that.<br /><br />Cheers to all and Merry Xmas.<br /><br />Edit: Reading the Wiki now - seems nobody reads it - next is PGP - do you actually use PGP whilst on Silk Road to send messages to vendors?? I assumed as I was already on the site messaging would already be secure. <br /><br />

				Congrats! I&#039;m glad to see you speak of using PGP. That is extremely important and something many first timers overlook. It is pretty easy to catch on and there are tons of people here who will help you until you are comfortable. Remember, everyone&#039;s security and safety is paramount here. Things like PGP and staying in escrow are two ways to make sure your stay here is a pleasant one. <br />I know how anxious you can get waiting on that package, especially the first one. Please remember to be patient. Even more so this time of year. If you do have any issues please contact the vendor first, don&#039;t just go off and trash their feedback. Any good vendor here is all about customer satisfaction, but remember that is a two way street. Treat the vendors with respect they will make sure you are happy. At least the good ones will ;)<br />Enjoy your time here and be safe
