				Hey bud,<br /><br />It&#039;s 72289 -- the customer you won&#039;t respond to for shit. I&#039;ve asked several times now for the CORRECT tracking number that I paid for, and you said you would find for me. I don&#039;t really care who took the package to get it mailed and somehow had a receipt on Sunday but I do want my damn tracking number. Also while I sympthaize with a seller being busy I&#039;ve been asking for this patiently for the last 2 days. You were also supposed to send Express and the mail arrived and it&#039;s still not here. Want to explain to me and the rest of the SR forum how something that is sent Express, mailed on Sunday, would circulate on Monday morning, would not be here by Wednesday? Pretty sure they guarantee that. <br /><br />** Normally I don&#039;t call sellers out (actually first time doing this), but his inability to respond to my messages on SR has forced me to do this. <br /><br />I&#039;ll wait for your response (if I even get one)<br /><br />- Forum B magically appeared, so I posted this here too. In hopes that Davidd may actually respond&nbsp; ::) -

				Post office was closed on monday. Try tommorrow, then report back.<br />Otherwise it&#039;s showing up just in time.<br /><br />Also a note on DCN&#039;s/Tracking numbers.&nbsp; When some sellers are mailing upwards of 25+ packages a week, it&#039;s EXTREMELY hard to keep track of Every last DCN and who it belongs to, sometimes one disappears and I find it a week later laying in some random place.<br /><br />Point being is, davidd is doing his best to not only take care of you, but all of his other customers.

				I think even wanting a DCN is retarded.<br />I want no tracking.&nbsp; Otherwise is it really anonymous?

				I&#039;m moderately dyslexic... God forbid I make a mistake and copy the number wrong.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t take over 24hrs to respond to ANY of your messages. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been nothing but civil towards you, and you have been nothing but hostile to me over a simple fucking mistake! <br /><br />If it took longer than 2 days, then yes, you can get your money back, just take the slip to your PO and they will refund it. <br /><br />You ordered Friday night, I your order taken to the post office Saturday morning (You don&#039;t even have your facts straight, buddy). I got your order out fast as fuck, I could have taken up to 4 days to get it out and still been following SR guidelines. <br /><br />I pity you Exodus.
