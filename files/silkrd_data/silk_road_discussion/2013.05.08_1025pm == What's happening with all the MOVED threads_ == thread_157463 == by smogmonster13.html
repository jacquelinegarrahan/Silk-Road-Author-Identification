				The mods are cracking their whips. It was getting a bit crazy with the &quot;DID I JUST GET A CONTROLLED DELIVERY?!&quot; posts in the main Silk Road sub, and &quot;What if a vendor jerks off into your product&quot; in the Shipping sub! (I swear the latter was a real topic somewhere).<br /><br />Although... we sure could do with a &quot;Crazy Shit&quot; sub around here. All the Bathsalt Rambo threads would have been right @ home in there..
