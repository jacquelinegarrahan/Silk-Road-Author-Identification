				Seems like lately everyone&#039;s been dipping and the only solid guy I can think of who&#039;s around is XTC Express, who is getting those &quot;product never arrived&quot; reviews now too. Who else is there, someone who&#039;s reliable! I just need 5Gr for now. Thinking of going with XTC again but i&#039;ve only had the pills, and I need the powder.<br /><br />Suggestions?

				If you are looking for a vendor that will ship personal amounts to everywhere but the US you could try Schizofreen, he has the best prices and product on the Road. Also, his shipping methods are the best I have seen so far. Worldwide, try EMonkey, his shipping and products are also top notch.

If you don&#039;t live in the US and want personal sized amounts, he is the person to order from. His prices are killer, only topped by his quality. His PARTYFLOCK pills are the best I have ever taken. I just ordered quite a few of them recently. His packaging/stealth is pretty sneaky and creative, very professional. Schizofreen is also spot on with fast, responsive communication.

				After my thorough research... If you&#039;re a newbie buying from schizo, hes a selective scammer.<br /><br />I purchased from emonkey. I&#039;m sorta sticking to below 300 transaction vendors these days; if a vendor does not fear a 1/5 rating from me... Then why would they NOT scam me?! Its like in real life, if your buddy wants your money before you get the stuff, he just wants your money; you won&#039;t get any stuff.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to post on the vendor&#039;s threads. Some would rather give you drugs, than deal with a pissed off custy.<br /><br /><br />It takes upwards of 5+ transactions to make up the profit that&#039;d be gained from scamming you on even ONE CHEAP ITEM.

				Alright, I might try schizo out. I just don&#039;t wanna be waiting for a long ass time. With XTC Express, I always got my stuff withing 10 days, which is amazing. I ordered my first from dutchanbod and it never came. And crystals over powder.&nbsp; I&#039;ll check out your listings, slick. When do you think you&#039;ll restock?
