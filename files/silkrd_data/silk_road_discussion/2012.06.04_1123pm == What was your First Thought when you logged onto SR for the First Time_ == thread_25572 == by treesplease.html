				My first thought was no fucking way.<br /><br />I was just amazed and stunned I thought there was no way such a market could be real.<br /><br />The only reason that I found this site was because I was investing in Bitcoin at the time because I saw it&#039;s potential. (Was reading online somewhere about a bitcoin black market and I became intrigued )<br /><br />I still wasn&#039;t sure if it was a scam or not but went ahead and ordered 50x 10mg Valium tablets and got them in the post the next day.<br /><br />I was just stunned.............and then ended up spending all my bitcoin investment on drugs lmao&nbsp; 8)

				I just signed up, and my first thought is: who runs this?<br /><br />I have a hard time believing this DPR guy has managed to avoid the police while running a site like this - even with TOR. With surveillance at the point it is these days, it would be next to impossible to run a site like this without being detected through other methods than traffic analysis, though the costs of that wouldn&#039;t be prohibitive if the feds really wanted this taken down.

				&quot;Wow, holy shit, this can&#039;t be real....... Is that what I think that is?&quot;<br />&quot;Why didn&#039;t I know about this sooner?&quot;<br /><br />I realized that NPR and a couple of sites wrote pieces on this site but for some odd reason, I never heard or saw any of those reports until after I randomly found this site. This is on a different level than pirating music and movies. The perceived threat of getting caught feels &quot;real&quot; compared to normal piracy.<br /><br />My mouth dropped moments after looking at the type of buds that are available. Has my quest as a weed connoisseur to smoke the best buds on the planet finally be realized? One of my buddies gets good shit, but I don&#039;t know if his stuff can honestly compete with some of the strains I saw on here. That mystery will be answered next week hopefully. On top of that, the prices here are cheaper than what I normally pay for.&nbsp; I told a couple of my friends about this site when I saw them in person, but I doubt any of them will even consider using this site as they aren&#039;t as computer literate as I am and until I get my package in the mail. This is pretty much as close as I get to actually being in a dispensary and picking out what strain I want.<br /><br />It&#039;s strange. I feel like I&#039;m almost addicted to this site. I highly doubt I&#039;ll do 96% of the drugs on here, but I find it fascinating connecting to tor, logging on SR, looking at various drugs and hearing people talk about them, or waiting anxiously for new messages or update status on shipped items. The concept of this site is almost revolutionary--liberating in the sense that we&#039;re taking a (real) stand against drug prohibition laws. The community, for the most part, seems very nice and in the know about this site.&nbsp; As random paranoid thoughts about LE across my mind from time to time, I&#039;m smiling at the fact that a site of this magnitude even exists. However,&nbsp; if I was a parent, I&#039;d be angry as hell a site like this exists.

				Parents shouldn&#039;t be angry that silkroad exists. It&#039;s actually doing them a huge service. Parents really have no idea what their kids go through to score drugs IRL, you have to associate with some shady people who may sell you some shady product, or just plain rob you. This is safer for everyone involved.<br /><br />Of course, they will never actually see it that way, considering most people have better programming than the Tor network itself.

				I discovered it last Monday. Reaction: shock... then... yes... I suppose it should exist. A combination of tor and bitcoins... wait... no... yes... I&#039;ve got to try this. <br /><br />Then I spent about 2 hours finding out how to get bitcoins, and couple of nervous hours transferring a bit of money about... and I was finally ready to give it a try. Got two orders on the go at the moment - figured if nothing happens I haven&#039;t lost much and it&#039;s been an interesting adventure. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t received anything from the first order yet, but I&#039;m not worried as it&#039;s well within any delivery window stated for the EU.<br />

				&quot;wow, I&#039;ve been looking for this exact website for years!&nbsp; now I&#039;ve found it!!&quot;<br /><br />Our prevous online LSD hookup had gone off the radar, and we never had good luck finding a solid consistent source IRL, so stumbling onto SR was like winning the lottery.&nbsp; I really had been looking for a place just like Silk Road, where people could connect anonymously and without comprimising privacy.&nbsp; I never found anything even close to that solution until I found SR.&nbsp; Without it, we&#039;d be screwed.<br /><br />and, yes, I do sometimes think of SR as being addictive.&nbsp; window shopping for drugs is so intriguing :-)&nbsp; Plus, the online aspect gives vendors an opportunity to use a style of marketing that typically isn&#039;t used when selling drugs...example, some item descriptions that vendors use simply wouldn&#039;t fly IRL where the dealer has to speak the description, but comes off as almost funny when it&#039;s typed up online.&nbsp; <br /><br />Idunno, I&#039;m high...;-)<br /><br />

				All part of the ongoing plan by the shadowy new world order thats jockeying to control the world by joining oceania, eurasia and eastasia together for the first time ever.

				WOW...<br />Wild...<br />Hmmmm??<br />These were my initial reactions. Still VERY new to this but just sussing it out, slowly and carefully (the whole point of doing this was the risk reduction factor and not having to deal with local street dealers who seem to step on their gear like a herd of fucking Elephants!)<br />I&#039;m sure there&#039;s still plenty of Sharks on SR but, I&#039;&#039;m so impressed with the general sense of community and good vibes on here.

				My initial thought when I was told about it was - Buying drugs of the net? Gotta be bullshit. <br /><br />A while later people were still banging on about SR so I decided to register, get the whole bitcoin account up and running and check it out. I must admit my initial reaction on seeing what was for sale here was astonishment, amusement and then outright excitement! I firmly believe all narcotics should be legalised so this place was (and is) a tantalizing taste of a possible future once our governments catch up with us. <br /><br />I placed my first order within about 10 minutes. I ordered some freebase cocaine of some guy called c63amg. I then waited for my package. By this time a few of my mates had also got wind of SR and they all thought I was nuts that I had ordered drugs off the net and worst still then got the stuff sent to my home address in my own name. They were convinced it wouldn&#039;t come, or it would come and be shit or I&#039;d have the police turning up at my house.&nbsp; I must admit I was a little nervous. <br /><br />Three or four days later my package came. 1g of freebase cocaine. I was impressed by the packaging and opened the letter like a kid opening cards on his birthday. I was fucking excited! The product looked good so I nipped upstairs and had a quick smoke. POW! Best crack I have smoked in about 12 years. Fucking awesome. I simply could not believe the insane quality of the smoke that I&#039;D GOT IT OFF THE INTERNET!!!!!! <br /><br />Woohoo.&nbsp; :) <br /><br />Since then I&#039;ve ordered regularly and so far it has all been great quality. Ive had one package no show from the USA (I&#039;m in Europe) but that&#039;s part of the game. I think if the quality wasn&#039;t great then I probably wouldn&#039;t bother to come here as I can score drugs prettily easily where I am. But the quality of what I have ordered off SR has consistently been superb and as long as that high quality continues then I&#039;ll be doing my narc shopping here. It&#039;s fucking great. In fact this may sound a little lame but I would go as far as to say that so far Silk Road has made my year!!!! If it continues like it is it may just make my decade!!! <br /><br />Loving it. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br />

				Here&#039;s an example of how my life has changed since SR came into my life:<br /><br />A Silk Road Day - <br /><br />I&#039;ve decided I&#039;m going to take drugs all day today because I have the day off work. After breakfast I leisurely smoke a very pleasant .5g of high quality crack which I had received in the post a few days ago. I then follow that up with .1g of meth which I smoke in my own time after a light lunch. Then I take the dog for a long walk. He has a great time. After I get back and dry the mud off the dog I have a cup of tea and smoke a match head sized bit of china white on some foil. Hmm. Superb quality. It should really be pinned up but I don&#039;t pin up where I live (you gotta have some rules) but it smokes okay too. Later in the evening I will have a couple of beers and a light dinner. I will then smoke another little head of china white. I should be asleep by midnight. Nice. Awesome day off!<br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br />A Before Silk Road (BSR!) Day -<br /><br />I&#039;ve decided I&#039;m going to take drugs all day today because I have the day off work. Get on the bus and go to XXXX. Call up XXXX. Wait fucking ages until some shotta on a BMX to turn up. Hand the money over, he gives me the drugs. Then I get the bus back to my place. The whole thing takes about an hour and half so its already nearly midday of my day off. Better get moving!&nbsp; Open the drugs, the shotta&#039;s screwed up the order and I haven&#039;t got what I asked for. For fucks sake! He&#039;s fucking ripped me off. I call up XXXX. XXXX says it isn&#039;t his fault and he&#039;ll get it right next time. Put the phone down knowing full well that XXXX is full of shit. Smoke the crack. It&#039;s incredibly fucking bad. It&#039;s so bad I&#039;m burning 0.2g rocks in the pipe and I&#039;m still not getting any distance. Fuck this. I smoke the entire lot. <br /><br />It&#039;s now 1pm.<br /><br />Time to smoke the heroin. I open it up and its cut to fuck, burns red and short and after smoking all of it I&#039;m not even really that high. Fuck it. It&#039;s 3pm now. Fuck it. What am I going to do. Fuck it. Get on the bus and go to XXXX. Call up XXXX. Place my order and he assures me he will sort out the earlier fuck up. Wait fucking ages until some shotta on a BMX turns up. It&#039;s the same kid as before so I say &#039;you fucked up my last order mate.&#039; He looks put out and says &#039;fuck you man! I just deliver this shit. It&#039;s fucking XXXX&#039;s fault.&#039; Then we have an argument which ends with me shouting at the shotta &#039;You should be in fucking school!!! How old are you? Fifteen?!&#039; and him shouting back &#039;Fuck you! Prick. These are my ends and If I sees you on road you&#039;re gettin shanked bruv! For real!&#039; Eventually we both shut the fuck up. He gives me the drugs and I give him the money. We go our separate ways but he can&#039;t resist shouting &#039;Pussy-O!&#039; at me before he turns down an alley.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get the bus back to the flat. Open the drugs up and at least this time XXXX got it right. The crack is shit but there is just enough in there to do something. I smoke the fucking lot in an hour and a half. Then I smoke all the heroin. It&#039;s cut to fuck and tastes of mannitol which is this osmotic diaruettic to treat urine infections in patients with kidney failure.&nbsp; Fuck knows what else is in there. Not much heroin that&#039;s for sure. Once I finish I sit about feeling frustrated cos the drugs didn&#039;t get me where I wanted to go.&nbsp; Fuck it. I look at my watch. 6pm. I still haven&#039;t taken the dog for a walk. He&#039;s staring at me. Fuck it. I take the dog out. I walk to the bus stop. <br /><br />Then I get on a bus and go to XXXX. Call up XXXX. Wait ages for some shotta on a BMX to turn up. It&#039;s a different kid. And this one must be new to the game because he&#039;s paranoid as fuck and asking me if I&#039;m an undercover policeman and all sorts of shit. He&#039;s also scared shitless of the dog and he ends up accusing the dog of being an undercover policeman as well. I tell the kid to calm the fuck down and stop being such a dick! He goes mental and says &#039;If blue boy see me hanging out wiv some white prick like you and his stupid brown dog then I&#039;m gettin nabbed blud! U get me?!&#039; The kid looks so young its a joke so I say &#039;yeah well you should be at school. How old are you? Fifteen?&#039; He tells me to fuck off, hands me my drugs, snatches my money out of my hand, counts it and peels out of there. What a fucking dick. Then I get the bus back to my place. <br /><br />Do all the drugs. They&#039;re just as shit as the last lot. I look at my watch. 11pm! I&#039;ve just spent over £200 on shit drugs and it&#039;s time for bed. Fuck it. What a waste of a day. And I didn&#039;t even take the dog on a proper walk either. I go to bed feeling pretty fucking ashamed of myself.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;:(<br /><br />

				I thoroughly researched SR in the forums long before I ever created an account, but none the less, I was astounded, excited, and amazed- literally like a kind in a candy store...&nbsp; Or an adult in a drug store?<br /><br />Prior to my research, however, I thought that it had to be the most ridiculous, stupid, and ill-conceived idea I&#039;d ever heard of.&nbsp; Sending money to a random person so that they could mail me a package of drugs?&nbsp; GTFO, who would be stupid enough to do that?<br /><br />The more I read, the more it made sense, and then I saw the brilliance of it.&nbsp; Bitcoins.&nbsp; Tor.&nbsp; Hundreds of billions of pieces of mail shipped annually.&nbsp; Escrow.&nbsp; Feedback.&nbsp; A&nbsp; community of people sharing their knowledge and experience.<br /><br />I am so glad that I followed up on the concept instead of simply dismissing it as internet bullshit.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I first logged in yesterday so it&#039;s still pretty fresh to me.&nbsp; My thoughts are that this place is really impressive, how people have established such a community where everyone is anonymous, you can pay with a digital currency and you can get your drugs literally in the mail.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not bought anything yet but I plan to soon - just waiting for BTC to die down a bit to its usual rate since I hear it&#039;s a bit high right now.&nbsp; Also the community seems pretty nice so far; not quite the stereotype the government might have one believe.

				SR is nothing new to me and my buddies. We had plenty of hidden clearnet sites in the day!<br /><br />Difference here was the BTC concept. You could get escrow on other sites, worked well but this was ten years or more.<br /><br />SR had a better selection as other sites were basically one guy using his contacts.<br /><br />Lots of Dutch ones.<br /><br />Here is just more secure and better choice with forum reviews and vendor feedback as each person FE.<br /><br />

				Hehe, I got to try the product before even knowing about SR, but when my friend introduced me, I was shocked. At first I was like a kid in a candy store, checking out everything, drooling all over the internet goods :P Now when I&#039;ve been here for some time, I only use it for buying the products I actually need, when I first was here I spent hours just checking out every possible vendor and of course every possible product :D It&#039;s really a breeze of fresh air for me due to the fact, that where I live the weed(which is the only thing I&#039;ve bought successfully) is 20€/G and the quality is terrible. Here I get it cheaper, better quality and... wait for it.... sometimes, even FASTER! Yeah... I really am loving SR, as the system and now lately the community :P Of course there are swindlers, but no system is perfect.

				My First Thought went to the developers. To be honest I wanted to say &quot;Bravo&quot; but that isn&#039;t what I first thought. I wondered how long it will keep going, for the powers that pretend to be can of course pull the plug, but they are not as of yet as it would adversely affect their ROI&#039;s on their last budgets, which didn&#039;t include this. So my initial thought was they could have put a better front end on it but hey, fuck, that is just ridiculously pedantic considering the feat, and then &quot;As long as it doesn&#039;t get too much bigger human laziness and &quot;The System&quot; plays into the hands of SR beautifully,&nbsp; until someone gets a Bee in their Bonnet...which is usually a political decision...it won&#039;t come from LEO up, it can&#039;t happen that way...TOR is simply budget burning...unless the USMIL get involved, well if they get involved and are actually organized about it, which means another five years then...<br /><br />The thing is, if the BTC services get better, and don&#039;t have stupid rip off like names and dodgy Eastern European wash over sites and get more country specific, this thing could exponentially mushroom.<br /><br />Which put me back to my first thought.

AND the cowardly pervertS as to what the above babj... said, they should be banned immediately, and burned to death (truck tyre wedged down over the body and arms and lit on fire, real fucking Rwanda style violence) in real life. Its not funny.<br /><br />Drugs and other things on SR bring us together in solidarity and understanding each other through the chats etc, Creepy child perverts will ruin the good time here, so will scumbag Nazis and rasicts, there should be zero tolereance to it, on the SR and real life.

The site has really evolved over the last year or so. I kind of miss the old discussion system, I miss a certain vendors shrooms :p (but understand why he stooped vending them), and I still keep a copy of that just in case email around, just in case.

				When SR first came about you didn&#039;t have to log in to view products. Before any links were posted on the Hidden Wiki or anything it was rumored on internet message boards. I saw a picture of the main page first and was like do want and then not too long later I saw a link posted on an image board. I was like there&#039;s not a lot of diversity on here in terms of drugs and vendors but I can definitely see potential for this website and the overall methods it employs. I actually watched it for like a month before making an account to make sure it wasn&#039;t anything sketchy. Eventually enough people caught on after it got posted on the Hidden Wiki (and obviously other sites as a result) that the various media outlets caught on. This started bringing in thousands of new customers per day which was somewhat good at the time being that the customer to vendor ratio was so fucked up. Now anyone with an internet connection would have to be living under a rock to not know about this place.

				I was a bit skeptical then after much research I thought &quot;ok this is cool.&quot;. Delving deeper I had no problem understanding the whole bitcoin thing, I was a bit surprised at the exchange rate though. Then I decided I would purchase, but PGP was so intimidating. I set up PGP on my Linux box and experimented till I got the hang of it. Two months and several hundred dollars later I can say I am quite glad I found this place now if I could just find some more bitcoins.

				I thought it was a honeypot and that LE had people fooled. I researched for a few months, and lurked around the forums for a very long time before I jumped into my first purchase. I grabbed a couple pieces of paraphernalia as to not break any law just to see if the shit would come. I then started with electronic purchases, and then finally jumped into my first major order.<br /><br />Ever since I came to SR my life has been a lot more enjoyable, but I find that I&#039;m constantly paranoid, lol.

Coke prices vary some but one thing you can always count on is the high prices keeping people with low funds from expanding and high funds from not doing so. In it&#039;s most simple terms this means 2 things - shit coke will either be the same price per gram no matter what amount on you buy but in most cases will be be exponentially cheaper the more you buy, but expsensive coke will either be EXACTLY a per gram&nbsp; price or a decent deal on the super high end grade.<br /><br />What I&#039;m trying to get at is if you can afford to buy a gram of high grade stuff, even if it&#039;s 60 a gram on the street (and thsts the max unless you&#039;re retarded or live in the country..same difference :P), most dealers of the high grade will only charge per gram or do a semi-decent deal on per pz or q/h/3q bar....so how are people on here selling it for upwards of 200$ gram?!?!&nbsp;

				I found it through my interest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />At first glance I was sceptical, but confident that a system like this &#039;could&#039; work even if this one didn&#039;t (after spending a full week reading and learning all I could about it I made a buy and found out it did work). I found this manifestation of the idea to use all of these crypto tools together i.e. TOR Hidden Service, Bitcoin, and GnuPG to run a website to buy/sell anything over the Internet was the most exhilarating experience !<br /><br />I thought to my self, &quot;Wow, we did it! Cryptography and OpenSource development has truly set us Free! This Silk Road combined with Wikileaks really demonstrates the full power of Cryptography to enable people to stand up to their government and communicate freely and securely... If the Silk Road can stand up to world governments then TOR Hidden Services can loose that &quot;Experimental, Not to be considered a strong anonymity system&quot; tag. I&#039;m positive many Governments including the USA have well funded teams of people dedicated to bringing down the Silk Road. If a Tor Hidden Service can stand up to that then it is solid tek.&quot;<br /><br />What an amazing time we live in :)

It&#039;s amazing how automation and technology can remove some of the sketchiness of life and permit us to be nice, peaceful human beings like we all want to be. Bitcoin within itself has been an incredible experiment. Silk Road is an example of a community that has adapted this tool to create a liberating environment, something we all take part in creating. <br /><br /><br />

				I almost made it here a couple of months ago, getting as far as the tor website before getting distracted and following the butterflies somewhere else on the internet... in the same fashion, I&#039;m not quite sure how I ended back on the tor website a couple&nbsp; of days ago, but this time I went all in.<br /><br />first thought was wow, here it is, and it&#039;s even cooler than I imagined... went right to LSD:, yup!&nbsp; its there, and i&#039;ve always wanted to try DMT,and....OK time figure out BTC.<br /><br />48 hours later after extensive research in the forums (and window shopping on SR), I&#039;ve finally figured out PGP and have BTC on the way.&nbsp; This has been a fun learning experience so far!

				Well here is mine, still fresh and buzzing.&nbsp; ive just placed my first order 2 minutes ago. ive been waiting 3 hours for BTC to enter my SR account.<br /><br />It was last wednesday evening when i first heard about SR, id gone to the pub afterwork and the barman - a student was talking about it to another local.<br />I was instantly excited because I had tried to track down a source on the web but with no luck, Id almost given up.<br />To make matters worst the quality of hard drugs in my city is pathetic at the moment and has been for a couple of years now.<br />I had just given up drugs and was sticking to my script because I was sick of wasting good money on shit that wasnt doing anything other than poison me.<br /><br />I quickly finished my pint and went home, fired up the PC and got the onion and logged into SR.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />It was better than I imagined, I was like an adult in a drugstore cowboy raid, the more I saw and read the more I realised this is the real deal.<br />I was so excited I couldn&#039;t sleep, my heart was racing and I was sweating (partly due to heroin withdrawal I must admit) but non the less, what a fucking excellent day.<br /><br />I then spent the next day sorting out bitcoins!!&nbsp; what a ball ache! but fucking worth every satotoshi!! or WETF&nbsp; bitcoin decimals are called&nbsp; ???<br />then I waited 2 days for my funds to appear, then I couldnt get them into my SR account but managed it via instawallet. <br />Now 5 days later, ive taken the plunge, it would have been sooner if I could. Ive still not figured out PGP yet but I understand SR encrypt your name and address anyway and delete once its been forward to the seller?&nbsp; <br /><br />The guys who have set up SR are legends imo,&nbsp; well done chaps.

I also recommend buying the CD&#039;s of these with cash in a shop because who knows who is watching this forum<br />and trying to get a lead on what you might download off torrents or buy online etc. -- Paranoid Pine.<br /><br />Anyway, here&#039;s playlist for obtaining a high pine.<br /><br />Tom Waits - &quot;Going out West&quot; (Bone Machine album)<br /><br />Juno Reactor - Labyrinth. This is a seriously badass album. Was part of the Matrix. <br /><br />Dirty Sanchez&#039;s &quot;Get it Wet&quot; and &quot;Fucking on the Dancefloor&quot; -- I think it is the Dirty Sanchez, and then the Really Rich Italian Satanists albums. It&#039;s completely outrageous music, very addictive and very suitable for working on the darknet. At volume. Yes! Actually that applies to the entire playlist.<br /><br />Nouvelle Vague&#039;s &quot;Guns Of Brixton&quot; and &quot;Too Drunk To Fuck&quot; <br /><br />Massive Attack&#039;s &quot;Angel&quot;<br /><br />The entire Dark Knight album!<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes (first movie) album<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire&#039;s &quot;Mausam And Escape&quot; and &quot;Paper Planes&quot; (MIA I think)<br /><br />Finally I love Parov Stelar&#039;s Coco album. Happy music! Such joy! :)<br /><br />--<br /><br />At the moment however, I&#039;m listening to Metallica&#039;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and reading the Communist Manifesto (not a pal of the philosophy clearly, but still the best propaganda in history!) to obtain inspiration in warding off the evils of Privnote and other similarly dreadful nonsense.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				&quot;Holy fuck, this can&#039;t be real.&quot;<br /><br />Over a few days of research, the following thought process was along the lines of:<br /><br />&quot;No really, holy fuck this can&#039;t be real.&quot;<br />&quot;This is a Law Enforcement thing, right?&quot;<br />&quot;THEY&#039;RE TALKING ABOUT IT ALL SO OPENLY!!!!&quot;<br />&quot;Nah, it&#039;s got to be bollocks.&quot;<br />&quot;Wha?!

For the most part I&#039;m far too terrified... I have recently started consuming weed for medicinal and recreational purposes but have spent years wanting to try it and been unable to find a dealer. Strangely enough, finally finding a dealer IRL after years of looking and realising just how much of a miracle cannabis is happened not long before I found SR! Happy days!

				It was just another evening. My girlfriend and I had been looking at questionable online pharmacies, appraising the viability of the ordeal, when we came upon the silkroad. When I logged in, which took a whole day a page refreshes at first, I recalled the expeditions of various 16th century explorers of the Americas. For a long time they traipsed through unnamed jungle in search of hidden treasure, all the time they clung to a mythological account which suggested the existence of a city of great splendor. The vital draw of ne&#039;er charted seas, places of myth and mysticism, this is what I felt the first time I saw the silk road. Bright light pouring out of the computer screen, I think ever last person on it mistook this light for the gilded city of El Dorado. Not to say the silk road is no such place, but needless to say the mythological city of El Dorado has been replaced by a still beautiful Lake Guatavita.

				I am skeptical, sounds too good to be true. I am here not for fun drugs, but for prescription drugs. I&#039;m really hoping that this works out; I&#039;m here because I&#039;m stuck in a shitty situation. I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta (antidepressant) for a couple years and found out that my psychiatrist died, leaving me with three pills and no refills. No one has taken over the practice and the family has disregarded all protocols for this type of thing. While I understand their (or they&#039;re, actually) grieving, WHAT THE FUCK. I don&#039;t have a primary care physician and the [necessary] bureaucracy and waitlists have left me in a shitty fucking situation for the next month +. I&#039;ve done everything short of feigning suicide (so I&#039;m put on a 72 hour mandatory hold and get three days of meds) soooooo, fingers crossed!<br />Also, if this pulls through I may be back for fun drugs!

				I first heard the words Silk Road in a casual conversation with a close friend.&nbsp; He commented that another friend had become quite good at navigating the silk road to find what he wanted.&nbsp; As that boy had just come back from Afghanistan as a civilian contractor, my mind filled in the gaps with the centuries old silk road that I grew up reading crazy stories about.<br /><br />But then it came up again thru Wired and other sources.&nbsp; So I had to start reading to understand.&nbsp; You all know the path, first you grasp TOR, then you start making sure you can handle encryption with PGP/GPG, and some anonymous mailer til Tormail, and of course some onetime stuff like Privnote.&nbsp; Then to the Silk Road itself.&nbsp; I reached out to my friends to be sure, and got some more tips in security and setup my environment, then jumped onto the Silk Road myself.<br /><br />And all I could do was smile.&nbsp; As I clicked thru the options and thought about all the times I sat in a hotel room, in a strange city, wishing I could reach out and find something.&nbsp; Or sitting home wanting to just relax, play a bit after long long hours working hard, but knowing the risks of hunting for toys were far beyond the joy of the find.&nbsp; See, from my personal view, I am one of a large % of folks who simply cannot drink.&nbsp; Alcohol is like poison to my system, and I am not alone.&nbsp; Those of us watch others booze up to relax, grabbing a cold one to help close down a day.&nbsp; Thus having access to something as simple as a little bit of smoke to help wind down the day is important simply for sanity.<br /><br />So finally finding a place I could just be me was an awesome feeling.&nbsp; I read for a week straight before I logged in.&nbsp; I read forums here another week straight before I funded an account.&nbsp; Then I read reviews and comments for another week before I finally reached out to buy something.&nbsp; And this is my first posting to the forums.&nbsp; Because tonight, I decided I had moved past newbie and into contributor because the concept still makes me smile.&nbsp; A big fat wide grin that says &#039;mmmhmmmmm&#039; and gives meaning to &#039;PLUR&#039; once more.<br /><br />I am sure that as we speak, the path we call the Silk Road is under attack from a thousand differing directions.&nbsp; Governments, criminals, and asswipes galore are all pounding on the walls, looking for cracks, and hunting for holes.&nbsp; And they will take some of us.&nbsp; They will hunt and bag a few.&nbsp; So we must all follow the rules, and keep the faith, protect this community that we all find in some ways our own.&nbsp; Cause everyone out there wants to take it down or take it over.<br /><br />My first thought was literally &#039;PLUR&#039;, my second thought was how to keep my own self unique but unknown, and my third was how to protect the community that I knew I would grow to love.<br /><br />In my very first transaction, I thought I knew the steps, I interpreted the directions and followed the way... But felt a sting when things did not come out my way.&nbsp; I learned about hedging and fees, and that the buyer pays the price when things are cancelled.&nbsp; Yet, when I reached out to folks to debate it, none did anything but give me back respect and honor.&nbsp; Explaining the information I was missing, apologizing for the impacts, and never ever disrespecting my view.&nbsp; So far I have been shown that the community is far far more about people then products, and that to travel the Silk Road means much more then just hunting for toys :)<br /><br />Thank you to everyone who conceived, designed, built, maintain, and moderate the entire path.&nbsp; As well the vendors who have worked hard to prove their products, and themselves... and of course, all the traders who understand its all about Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect.&nbsp; And treat the Silk Road and all that travel it with honor.&nbsp; Truly it is far more then a candy store, but a community of free barter.<br /><br />So again I say.... My first thought, mirrored in a smile, was PLUR.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Anjin<br />

				well first i had no idea what a bitcoin was and thought they were funny looking dollar signs... so $5 for a g of mdma was crazy. <br /><br />But seriously when i first heard of it, i thought you had to be crazy to do it. And the only people who&#039;d ever do it would do huge quantities for big time deals and use fake names and PO boxes etc...&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, i saw the community, the security, the measures taken to ship and anonymize, the ease of research for vendors and products. Just everything fucking clicked. I was sold within ten minutes of reading.

				My first thought after I logged onto SR for the first time was, &quot;I think I died and went to heaven.&quot; It was at least 10 times more exciting than the first time I logged onto eBay back in 1998, and I thought that was an amazing experience in online shopping. After lurking for weeks, studying, watching, I knew that this was the time for which I had been waiting. Finally, I could obtain my medicine in the quality to which I had previously been accustomed.

				At first I was 99% positive I was going to get ripped off. &quot;There&#039;s no way this is real,&quot; I thought as my jaw dropped to the keyboard. After doing some research, I decided to order an eighth against my better judgement. While I waited for the package to arrive, I was sure that I wasn&#039;t going to be getting anything. I left for a short trip and returned to find a package in my mailbox.<br /><br />I ran to my room and grabbed a scissors. I kept repeating, &quot;you&#039;ve got to be fucking kidding me,&quot; as I opened the package. When I cut open the vac seal and got a whiff of Mary Jane&#039;s sweet scent, I almost passed out/shit my pants from excitement. I literally had no idea what to do or say. When I recovered, I packed a bowl and the rest is history.<br /><br />I seriously won&#039;t ever forget that night. Definitely changed my life for the better.

Living in an area where the quality can vary wildly (and where I don&#039;t have good connections) is kinda frustrating.

And also you&#039;re right: buying less than a quarter on SR is probably not a good use of your money but again that entirely depends on where you live: someone in the middle of South Dakota is probably much better off ordering here than trying to find a local. If you live in a top 50 population city, though, I don&#039;t see the need: you be able to find plenty of good dealers locally. If I had the drive (no pun intended) I&#039;d travel 1+ hour to a major metropolis by me, but I&#039;d have to go to neighborhoods I&#039;d feel very unsafe in. We&#039;re also paying for the convenience and the relative safety (compared to buying from some shady dealer in a ghetto)

				I could not believe it...and even after the first package came, I was still not believing it was true....than after a month I realized and started to really look and undestand the thing in it full scheme. Not just the SR but the action toward the &quot;system&quot; . Screwing the MATRIX. Started afterward too look and fell part of a comunicty that we all should defend and takecare of. <br />Still investigating and hoping it will last but also afraid of&nbsp; future, because media are putting lot of attention on this....

				I was thinking of all the experimenting that could be done. I had heard about SR for awhile before I joined, but never explored my curiosity. Glad I did, sure beats a lot of the fake/cut shit you run into on the streets. It&#039;s good to know EXACTLY what you are getting :)

				Even though I had heard talks of SR existing&nbsp; I never actually had a need to seek it out. I had RL connections, was happy with my supplier and wasn&#039;t a user of anything (really!). Also, the demand around here didn&#039;t warrant finding new products.<br /><br />Then, I was introduced to MDMA.... and EVERYTHING changed. lol. I&#039;d found a drug I actually loved taking myself and was bound and determined to find a stable connection. Impossible to find it around here, I set out to see if what I&#039;d heard was true. I entered the road, had a look around and sat back in amazement. First I thought &quot;Holy shit, this actually exists, damn, I&#039;ve been missing out!&quot;. At the same time I thought &quot;this could be the most elaborate undercover operation ever known to man&quot;. I spent months absorbing the forums and reading vendor reviews. I made sure I got all of my security measures in place and then took the plunge. When that first pack arrived in the mail I was like a kid on Xmas morning. It truly was &quot;X&quot;mas considering what I&#039;d ordered, haha. I just wanted to get home, tear into the package and play with my new toy!&nbsp; :P <br /><br />After the initial &quot;OMG this is awesome!&quot; subsided I felt like I was now part of something truly amazing. Something only the few, the determined and the (mostly) intelligent could successfully be a part of or even know it exists.<br /><br />&nbsp;A whole new world had opened up. <br /><br />A big &quot;THANK YOU!&quot; to DPR and all involved.

				At the time, I had barely just started smoking weed. Drugs were completely new to me. I was amazed, then I stopped going to the website. Months later, I tried MXE. I tried a couple others before that, but MXE really got me thinking... this shit is legal, I can just order it on the clearnet. Then when the RC scene got hit bad, particularly Euphoric Knowledge, I started to do a bit of research. Then I remembered - Silk Road. If the RC vendors are legit, then maybe the SR vendors are too. So I gave it a try. My first order was a xanax sample, my second was a gram of molly from Pf. Couldn&#039;t have been happier.<br /><br />The novelty of SR still hasn&#039;t worn off for me. ;D

				Similar to the thoughts any young boy has the first time he&#039;s about to get a girl&#039;s bra off. As you start you can&#039;t believe it&#039;s about to happen. And when you finally see a glorious pair of breasts it&#039;s such a sensory overload that there aren&#039;t too many thoughts. Just taking in the sights and sounds. Ah but now even decades later I still feel overwhelmed every time I see my wife&#039;s breasts. And every time I log on to SR I think I have a bit of the old wonder struck twinkle in my eyes. Guess I&#039;m still just a druggie pervert. Age does not make men better. Haha. <br /><br />So to sum up SR = TITS<br />
