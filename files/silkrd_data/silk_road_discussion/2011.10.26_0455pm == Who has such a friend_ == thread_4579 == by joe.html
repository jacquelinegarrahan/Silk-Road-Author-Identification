				From the buyers guide:<br /><br />&nbsp; &quot;Use a different, unrelated address than the one where your item will be kept such as a friends house&quot;<br /><br />I thought about this one, and here&#039;s the criteria such a friend would have to match:<br /><br />&nbsp;* Must be fully trustworthy, now and in the future<br />&nbsp;* Must be clean and never take any drugs, let alone have any at his house<br />&nbsp;* Must accept my drug habits<br />&nbsp;* Must be OK with police searching his home<br />&nbsp;* Must be resistant in case of questioning by authorities<br />&nbsp;* Must be able to forgive me in case he gets into trouble<br /><br />Now who the hell has such a friend, I mean, does such a person exist? It seems to me these properties are conflicting. Who is ok with his friends doing drugs, police searching his home and asking questions and at the same time, does no drugs himself?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to ask, are people really having the stuff delivered to a friend&#039;s house?<br /><br />I&#039;d be devastated to see a highly trusted friend get into trouble because of me, so I just have the stuff sent to my own address and live with the consequences should shit hit the fan.<br />

				&nbsp;* Must be fully trustworthy, now and in the future<br />You should have at least one of these. Otherwise life is pretty shit.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;* Must be clean and never take any drugs, let alone have any at his house<br />I don&#039;t know about not ever be taking drugs. I know plenty of people who take drugs but never have any in their homes. However if you are in the USA, i know there are plenty of people(like doctors) who wont take drugs even if they wanted to due to random screenings.<br /><br />&nbsp;* Must accept my drug habits<br />Friends should be able to tolerate a lot of things for friends. Again, having someone who put up with your shit and still wants to hang out with you is something worth having. I dare say more than the drugs.<br /><br />&nbsp;* Must be OK with police searching his home<br />This one is a bit tougher, but if they got caught up in it, a good friend would know there might have been that risk if they were forewarned. If it happened, and they have nothing at their house, they will have nothing to fear and really isn&#039;t a massive problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;* Must be resistant in case of questioning by authorities<br />::looks up to the first comment::<br /><br />&nbsp;* Must be able to forgive me in case he gets into trouble<br />::Looks at the third comment::<br /><br /><br />Looking at this I can easily say I have about 2 friends who would do this for me. However, because I love them and want to be a good friend back to them, I would never want to put them through this type of crap in the first place.<br /><br /><br />Amush

				Yep, good point...gets into some serious ethical shit, to say the least...I think it&#039;s an area that people just want reassurance, that there is a *correct* way to do this...and, like so much else on here, there is *not* reassurance to be had...we have to use common sense, and also, be a bit fatalistic about the whole thing...<br /><br />Obviously, if we do find a good way to get deliveries, we can&#039;t really spell it out on here, because we don&#039;t know who is reading...tough, since we want to help out...<br /><br />Use common sense.&nbsp; &#039;Ride yer own beef&#039; to me, means basically, it&#039;s on me...if I go out on a limb, say, use some other address, an abandoned house that gets lots of mail, a &#039;friend&#039; who isn&#039;t home, a little old lady, blah blah blah...and my shit doesn&#039;t arrive, I can&#039;t go back screaming at the vendor....<br /><br />In RL, my mail has always arrived,&nbsp; if I have a vendor I trust, I figure it&#039;s coming to the address I gave...if it doesn&#039;t show...well, I eat it.&nbsp; I&quot;ll mention it to vendor, in case he says &#039;whoops, I screwed up...&#039; but like so much on here, it&#039;s a work in progress and we none of us know how to do it perfectly, best I can tell..

				I think what they don&#039;t know can&#039;t hurt them would be very applicable in this situation :P
