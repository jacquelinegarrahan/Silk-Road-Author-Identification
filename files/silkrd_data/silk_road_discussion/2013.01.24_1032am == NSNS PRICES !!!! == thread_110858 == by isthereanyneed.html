				They are fucking insane to say the least...........<br /><br />Any one buying border line soap bar pollen for £14 per gram literally needs a good talking too, every other vendor comes down in price with the current btc rise but this guy stays the same or even puts them up?<br /><br />On the street I pay £5 per gram max for pollen which is the best around with a star of david stamp, I am not being nasty or trying to start a hate thread or anything I just think its beyond a joke that people still buy at this price I mean some of his weed with the current prices works out at over £36 per gram come on NSNS sort it out and get with the program like other vendors !!!!! <br /><br /><br />:o

				Lol if i got the sample that&#039;d be cool, if i didn&#039;t that&#039;d be cool too. We actually have plenty of hash here in the USA, the prices are actually just much higher here than elsewhere(medical). I honestly think aces prices are low, but that&#039;s if his main clientele is in the europe, then they&#039;re around where they should be(I think). USA the medical stuff for hash can be anywhere between 25-40 a gram where i live at a dispensary. I don&#039;t know street price, but i can tell you that most people in the US that live in states with medical collectives, that&#039;s where they get them. <br /><br />You also are right about the quality, i have never had euro hash before. I would however be offering the US perspective, which i would expect is a decently sized market for people buying hash(especially in bulk, cause no one wants to pay U.S. prices). Anyways, like i said, if i got the chance to give advice, SWEET. If not meh, opportunity missed for me.

				The way I see it fair play to him.&nbsp; If people are stupid enough to pay that much money for a gram of weed which seems from the pictures that he has renamed several times, then why would he lower prices?&nbsp; He is making a killing!&nbsp; Protest these prices by not giving your business.&nbsp; This is a free market and if he makes sales at those prices unfortunately some people have too much money.

				If people want to pay that price then that is their decision. The vendor appears to be doing very well and getting good reviews so why change anything?<br /><br />He&#039;s doing his thing, customers are doing theres. Simple as that. Nobody is forcing you to pay those prices....
