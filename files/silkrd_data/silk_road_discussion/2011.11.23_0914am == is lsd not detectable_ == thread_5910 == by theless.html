				i placed my first order 4 days ago and it quickly got in transit but i doubt that anyone ever has ordered anything from lebanon. i also doubt that anyone from the postal service has ever seen a blotter :P it was lsd in a plain envelop.<br /><br />is it really not detectable? and if so then stakes are high that the envelop will arrive? and how long can it take?

				Probably not detectable. Looks just like a letter and gives off little or no scent. i think postal inspectors are mostly concerned with larger packages.

				LSD is pretty safe to ship, its a little piece of paper. A normal envelope will almost never get stopped or even looked at because even if it contains something, the amount it contains is most likely bugger all.
