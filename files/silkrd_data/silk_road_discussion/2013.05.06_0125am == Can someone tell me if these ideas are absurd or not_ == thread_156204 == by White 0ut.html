If you think I use only a single address for SR you are nuckin futz! I have more than you can count on 4 hands :D<br /><br />I also have the finances to cover any drops that could possibly go south, all my buyers would be required to FE but I would never take it away from the buyer if one of my orders didn&#039;t come through.<br /><br />I would only order from certain vendors with guaranteed stealth &amp; rep.<br /><br />There are measures that would be put into play to ensure that if a drop did go wrong, I would be the one losing the money.<br /><br />But I won&#039;t because things will be taken into consideration such as buyer stats, the vendor stats, quantities, ect.<br /><br />Not to mention you can just split bulk into multiple shipments and we can do them 1 by 1 to build trust.<br /><br />I would simply require FE just to pay for their order, not for the fact that something might go wrong &amp; your responsible. That&#039;s nonsense.<br /><br />I&#039;m not being harsh towards you friend, I am just stating what my intentions were. I think you might be misunderstood a bit.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156204.msg1094068#msg1094068">Quote from: Jack N Hoff on May 06, 2013, 03:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I like the low recoil and a hundred yards wouldn&#039;t be difficult.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget the tripod. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thermal is always a pleasure to have as well :)

				I&#039;m not talking about myself using the service. But you&#039;re going to make more cash importing and selling yourself than simply acting as a PO box of sorts.&nbsp; Think about the financials of it. What are ya gonna do, charge someone 100 bucks to receive a 150 buck package?&nbsp; Your more than welcome to do it, just doesn&#039;t make much sense for you to assume all the risk over that little margin.
