				A month ago the number of items in the drugs category was around 1900, today it is at 851.&nbsp; If Silk Road is truly growing at the pace that everyone is talking about, how come the amount of items has been cut by more than half?<br /><br />I realize a lot of the &#039;items&#039; were just custom orders and priority shipping for vendors.&nbsp; Plus, the advent of stealth mode probably is the major contributing factor, but it still seems like the number dropped off DRASTICALLY.<br /><br />Just curious if anyone has a good explanation.

				Stealth mode.&nbsp; Vendors can make their listings invisible to everyone but those that have became a &quot;fan.&quot;&nbsp; It is a way for vendors to quell large influxes of new buyer orders and still service orders from their regular consumer base.<br /><br />The listings all still exist, just not to you or anyone else unless they are a fan of the vendor.<br /><br />EDIT: fixed typo
