				I agree with OP to some extent. I don&#039;t believe we are necessarily entitled to uninterrupted, perfect service from Silk Road, but given the amount of money we have put into this site, we do deserve more than what DPR and his team are giving us right now. Some of us can&#039;t afford to wait with blind faith. We have a lot business in SR and we need to know what&#039;s going on so we can make decisions. Obviously specifics can&#039;t be given, but leaving us in the dark like this is unacceptable, and we shouldn&#039;t quietly tolerate it.<br /><br />People trying to shut complainers up make no sense to me. For one, we have a right to complain and we&#039;re free to do so. We complain in the hopes it&#039;ll put a fire up admin ass to change the way this is being handled. Two, the finger waggers are taking up just as much space and resources with their pointless threads calling complainers out.<br /><br /><br />Writing from my real account. CAUSE FUCK IT.

I think if DPR came on and said &#039;hey, we&#039;re down because of this problem, this problem and this problem&quot;, fewer people would be complaining.<br /><br />Possibly there are some security reasons for leaving everyone in the dark but, a vague description of the problem, whats causing the problem and a planned course of action would settle a lot of nerves.

				In 6 months DPR has made over 6k in commission just from me.&nbsp; I know the kind of people DPR is.&nbsp; He is most likely a talented 24-30 yr old guy, has a degree in a computer science field but probably can&#039;t find work because he has some social anxiety issues.&nbsp; He is a whiz at coding, but he can&#039;t find enough people/servers he trusts to really get things going smoothly as a team.<br /><br />So yeah he is loaded with dough, but what can he do with it until he figures out a solution.&nbsp; Personally I feel the &#039;day and a half away for vacation to come back to everything in a mess&#039; was just an excuse to quell panic, but I&#039;d do the same thing in the same situation.&nbsp; DPR needs time and experience to link up with other trusted persons that can expand the servers.<br /><br />

				Just a &quot;buyer&quot; looking at this here. One good point made was this shouldn&#039;t be your only source of income.

Without us buyers there would be no dealers like you! <br /><br />Oh excuse me, I meant &quot;Vendors&quot; - sounds so much more reputable. You&#039;re the dealer, I&#039;m the addict. <br /><br />Don&#039;t put all your eggs in one basket, I believe is the proper saying for you here. <br /><br />This is how they run their site. You can complain, sure. Won&#039;t do much good. <br /><br />Also there is another site on TOR exactly like this, and I found it yesterday while waiting. I saw many familiar sellers on there. - I know, some claim it&#039;s somebody else using their name.<br /><br />One guy admitted to me, he was the same guy, because he had to sell, and selling he was. I knew it was the same guy because we had done business before, and only he could know certain details. <br /><br />So this isn&#039;t the only game in town. <br /><br />Black Market Reloaded go check it out!&nbsp; 5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php - They give you the same guarantees as here. NONE !<br /><br />I hope it all comes back, and believe it will. These unrealistic expectations show just how &quot;too comfortable&quot; we have gotten, each in our own way. Happens with everything. <br /><br />Wait till the power grid goes out in your country for a week. How soon till there are shootings at supermarkets???<br /><br />Hang in there man. We&#039;ll all get through this. <br /><br />I hope!<br /><br />You may expect this, and feel you &quot;deserve&quot; that. - Call your department of consumer affairs, or another great bureaucratic agency created by an ever growing government ruining our country (sorry, still feeling the pain from the Obama win here in what used to be the USA.)

				am i silly to think that this delay could be because DPR might need to fly from one country to another to turn servers on or fix something because he cann&#039;t connect remotely?<br />i couldn&#039;t imagine he would trust to many people with that info.

				Sure DPR brings in a lot of money from this, but what were you doing before you discovered this website. What would you be doing without it? This site is a freedom not a right, really if DPR really wanted to take the site down and fuck off with all the money he could. But the fact that this hasn&#039;t happened shows he cares about his users. Now if you&#039;re a vendor on here, complaining about the downtime sure this is somewhat understandable. But downtime is downtime, and this downtime was supposed to be because of all the new members. Be that vendors or buyers. So here&#039;s a simple solution to any of you that feel the need to cry about this, as SR is currently the best anonymous market. If you know how to use tor, and access silkroad you know how to make an onion site. So go, ahead and make your vendor site so when there is downtime buyers can buy off of their known vendors. It really wouldn&#039;t be all that hard to create a &quot;downtime site&quot; would it? But since making a site to handle a lot of traffic (such as the traffic on silk road) you need some proper equipment. So just set up a simple page, just with your vendor information and what you have for sale. Update during downtimes, link here. problem solved?? <br /><br />As I said DPR is trying to bring us something that has really never been done before, he must protect his own ass along with ours. Ever try updating a website on a proxy? it&#039;s not the fastest thing in the world to do ;) Think of how hard it would be to get your website up and running while trying to be completely anonymous, for all he knows someone could&#039;ve been watching the server for every little update.<br /><br />Also, you&#039;re a vendor. Once again this website is a complete freedom, this is something which has never been done before. I don&#039;t think you understand what sort of website you&#039;re on here, this isn&#039;t clearnet. At any point he can take off with every penny in your account, why doesn&#039;t he? I assume it&#039;s because he has ethics, or just likes money. but with all this being said, print off a resume, and go for a walk. You&#039;re trusting your entire income on a very unstable currency and marketplace, that&#039;s a huge mistake. Inflation is inflation, and one day it&#039;ll all come toppling down. And if you ever forget that, you&#039;ll go down with it.<br /><br />When everything is said and done, I and many other users would like to thank DPR for the amazing service he has provided us with. Some people act like he needs to attend to all of your concerns, come on guys look at what you&#039;re doing. You&#039;re selling drugs on the internet, and you&#039;re worried about a bit of downtime? Get a hold of yourself and re-evaluate your life, don&#039;t trust your financial security on something so unstable without 100g backup in your bank.

People have lots of money invested and tied up all rely on SR being up. He charges for vendor accounts, he has money. I mean the least they can do is keep users much better informed and in the loop. Like I&#039;ve said, the DPR advocates are becoming minority.

But downtime is downtime, and this downtime was supposed to be because of all the new members. Be that vendors or buyers. So here&#039;s a simple solution to any of you that feel the need to cry about this, as SR is currently the best anonymous market. If you know how to use tor, and access silkroad you know how to make an onion site. So go, ahead and make your vendor site so when there is downtime buyers can buy off of their known vendors. It really wouldn&#039;t be all that hard to create a &quot;downtime site&quot; would it? But since making a site to handle a lot of traffic (such as the traffic on silk road) you need some proper equipment. So just set up a simple page, just with your vendor information and what you have for sale. Update during downtimes, link here. problem solved?? <br /><br />As I said DPR is trying to bring us something that has really never been done before, he must protect his own ass along with ours. Ever try updating a website on a proxy? it&#039;s not the fastest thing in the world to do ;) Think of how hard it would be to get your website up and running while trying to be completely anonymous, for all he knows someone could&#039;ve been watching the server for every little update.<br /><br />Also, you&#039;re a vendor. Once again this website is a complete freedom, this is something which has never been done before. I don&#039;t think you understand what sort of website you&#039;re on here, this isn&#039;t clearnet. At any point he can take off with every penny in your account, why doesn&#039;t he? I assume it&#039;s because he has ethics, or just likes money. but with all this being said, print off a resume, and go for a walk. You&#039;re trusting your entire income on a very unstable currency and marketplace, that&#039;s a huge mistake. Inflation is inflation, and one day it&#039;ll all come toppling down. And if you ever forget that, you&#039;ll go down with it.<br /><br />When everything is said and done, I and many other users would like to thank DPR for the amazing service he has provided us with. Some people act like he needs to attend to all of your concerns, come on guys look at what you&#039;re doing. You&#039;re selling drugs on the internet, and you&#039;re worried about a bit of downtime? Get a hold of yourself and re-evaluate your life, don&#039;t trust your financial security on something so unstable without 100g backup in your bank.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks to this site I do have $100g backup and I am grateful for it and DPR, which is why it is such an issue for me to be down for a week. This is where we differ, for me this is a business, for you it is where you get your next fix, which is why you have idolized DPR and come to his defense. He should be praised and defended on several levels, QOS is not one of them, unfortunately.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, This is where we differ. I work full time, and spend a very small fraction on recreational use. While you make all your money off selling drugs, and then complain when things get a little different. While you&#039;re sitting there refreshing the page, relying on a completely unstable market/currency. I&#039;m out working 60-100 hours a week to make my money, and it comes in every week, I don&#039;t have to rely on someone else ;) what you&#039;re doing right now is relying on a few site administrators and a made up currency to keep your life financed. The other places we differ, Is I was going to be a computer programmer, and I know what is required to build a website like this. It&#039;s not even a walk in the park on the clearweb, nevermind here.&nbsp; &quot;which is why you have idolized DPR&quot; I do not idolize DPR, However he is a very intelligent, very rich man. I promise you he made more money this year then you will probably ever see. <br /><br />All this being said, you&#039;re a vendor, and like some other vendors you&#039;re feeling like you&#039;re on top of the world #1 awesome guy because you found a great way to make some good cash. And it&#039;s safe! But you can&#039;t base your life around something like that, I don&#039;t even know why anyone would want to put themselves in that situation in the first place. If SR is your only Income, you lack what most people call common sense, and will find out soon when everything comes crashing down on you. <br /><br />Come on, let&#039;s get real and grow the fuck up. You would have more financial stability selling drugs on the street corner, the reason i&#039;m not a vendor? Because i&#039;m scared of watching the price of the bitcoin plummet the day I withdraw. You&#039;re playing a game of chance sir, you might aswell be gambling. Reality check, you&#039;re in this business on the internet, there&#039;s nothing you can do when you lose it all. You can argue with me as long as you would like, it&#039;s not going to change how things are. Until you make a site, or you find your own way around the downtime, you&#039;re stuck relying on DPR, so you better get on your knees and maybe he&#039;ll try and help ya out.&nbsp; He cannot hire people, who the fuck would you trust with that if you were him? get yourself together and get some common sense.<br /><br />And lastly <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72631.msg593922#msg593922">Quote from: bigdaddy5150 on November 15, 2012, 04:07 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72631.msg593772#msg593772">Quote from: whitenissan on November 15, 2012, 03:07 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Sure DPR brings in a lot of money from this, but what were you doing before you discovered this website.

				If DPR got busted for creating this site, he would probably be extradited to the US/EU or just arrested in whatever country he is in and probably get life in prison.&nbsp; He is taking a risk like everyone else here is, and should be compensated for it.&nbsp; He charges a fee for this, which is only fair and has made all the vendors here quite a bit of money.&nbsp; Some shit came up with the site, who the fuck knows what and either it gets fixed or it doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />And to the vendors bitching, have you ever actually sold drugs on the street?&nbsp; Its a lot more dangerous than it is here for many different reasons (law enforcement, people trying to rob you, people trying to rat you out to reduce their sentence, etc.)&nbsp; Its also impossible to network with anywhere near this many people.&nbsp; Silk Road going down is the cost of doing business, as is getting robbed, busted, etc.&nbsp; If you want some security get a legal job.&nbsp; I know if I was in a situation that I could get busted I wouldn&#039;t pop my head up, and I sure as fuck wouldn&#039;t if me getting busted probably meant life imprisonment.&nbsp; So everyone really needs to chill the fuck out and just wait and see.&nbsp; In the meantime, find another board to vend on.&nbsp; If SR goes down there will be people looking for a new place to call home, and the new boards will grow.&nbsp; Be proactive instead of complaining.

				Well I deposited 150 BTC while the power was out on the site, it sat in my SR address until yesterday (or the day before) and was then sent to some account I&#039;ve never seen or heard of. When I logged back in finally my account history has been deleted except the last withdrawal I made on the 3rd before it went down. I also, for experiments sake, deposited a measly amount in my account now while it&#039;s back just to see and that went through no problem.<br /><br />When SR support contacted me, within 9 minutes I had messaged back, TWICE, with all the details with regards to what happened and all the relevant details and still nothing in my account, no emails from SR and now the site&#039;s gone AWOL.<br /><br />I wish I knew it was down before I wired those coins, but even still you would imagine once it&#039;s back up, and you can clearly see the actions of the blockchain info that your money&#039;s there, imagine gow I felt to like in and fine .99c in my account.<br /><br />I&#039;ll leave it for you to decide what&#039;s up with that....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72631.msg593653#msg593653">Quote from: Goldust on November 15, 2012, 02:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72631.msg593566#msg593566">Quote from: letsgetreal on November 15, 2012, 01:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Because DPR offers something that you can&#039;t get anywhere else(although this outage may change that) I think people around here accept what would not be accepted anywhere else.<br />We all know that DPR is taking in an ever growing amount of profits from SR.

				I would like to point out that Dread Pirate Roberts is probably more than one person. My reasoning is that the fictional character Dread Pirate Roberts is more than one person. I quote Wikipedia:<br /><br />&quot;It is revealed during the course of the story that Roberts is not one man, but a series of individuals who periodically pass the name and reputation to a chosen successor. Everyone except the successor and the former Roberts is then released at a convenient port, and a new crew is hired. The former Roberts stays aboard as first mate, referring to his successor as &quot;Captain Roberts&quot;, and thereby establishing the new Roberts&#039; persona. After the crew is convinced, the former Roberts leaves the ship and retires on his earnings.&quot;<br /><br />Also, it is probable that more than one person is responsible for the operations of this website as it seems like a lot of work. It seems silly to me to refer to DPR as some sort of hero christ figure who will save us from this hell of not being able to log on to silk road all the time. Also, he is probably not one person who is making millions and sitting around on his ass all day using silk road for personal passive income. <br /><br />Regardless, I think the silk road is a great idea. I think there is a lot of passion for liberty amongst these people and I hope everything goes back to normal soon. Who knows what the fuck is going on? Maybe this is all building up to a surprise where we all log back in and DPR has credited everyone&#039;s account with ten bitcoins as a gift and he says merry christmas everyone!

				I&#039;m not into computers but somebody here said that it&#039;s easy (if you are) for vendors to start their own onion site and sell from that.<br />Well fuck me thats got to be the way to go. Leaving all vendor&#039;s on one site with the worlds media attention, worlds LE attention not to mention all those tosser hackers out there completely focused on one site naturally, eventually, one of those hawks will win. like now.<br />So wouldn&#039;t dozens of specialized onion sites for each vendor be a better option? <br />Whats that say about putting all your eggs in one basket?

				I was a vendor here since day #1 then had enough customers and just went private. I&#039;m positive this is just traffic related outages, and the idiots claiming they are responsible always show up whenever a site goes down. You&#039;ll know it&#039;s their doing if they actually start blackmailing and provide proof of whatever it is they did. If no proof, they&#039;re just scammers. <br /><br />Tor is not meant for this kind of site. I2p or Freenet yes, but Tor can&#039;t handle this kind of traffic unless you have a distributed database (cassandra) and have enough load servers to balance everything out, which I have no idea how to do under Tor. I2p you can do this. If this were my site I&#039;d mirror it on I2p at least to release some of the traffic load, and would have split the main .onion into multiple onions for multiple servers, all connected with distributed db. I assume this is what he is working on and it&#039;s failing because Tor is experimental and nobody I know has ever tried distributing up their network on it.<br /><br />Since DPR is already trusted for escrow, what he should do is concentrate on that while changing the entire format of the site. Right now it&#039;s set up like Amazon and is just going to keep needing bigger and more resources until the feds find it or it just dies under it&#039;s own load like what&#039;s happening now. <br /><br />Clone this site onto 10 servers around the world that are friendly to tor traffic and then keep your distributed database close to you by either running your own hosting company or even having it in your decoy office space you set up if you have a strong enough connection. You could configure the default .onion to be a massive openbsd switch/router and firewall that simply routes connections to all the other tor servers to prevent being overloaded. You can easily pay an openbsd guy to do this, and not have to tell him what it&#039;s for. They can set up the switch and then later you drop in your tor .onion address keys in place of the existing one&#039;s. <br /><br />Alternative is having a main page like torservers.net that lists all your entry points instead of exit points like it does now. When one server is full it simply denies access and gives options for other servers, all connected by cassandra db or some other nosql solution. <br /><br />Could also just run this entire place on Freenet or GnuNet, but have the database torrified and hidden which is only the important part anyways. If I was making $6k per day there is definitely some people I would hire under a fake company to help me set all this up properly, instead of going it alone which seems what DPR is doing which is too much work, hence endless downtime.<br /><br />My $0.02<br /><br /><br /><br />
