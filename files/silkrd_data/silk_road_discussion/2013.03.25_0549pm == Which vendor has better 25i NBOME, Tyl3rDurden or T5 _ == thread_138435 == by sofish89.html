				I&#039;ve only tried T5&#039;s 25i and I could vouch for it! They have great NBOMe products. They&#039;re really fuckin pure, good prices, and T5 has great communication. I&#039;d say try out T5.

				Can only vouch for Tyler&#039;s stuff, but it is A1***<br /><br />Clean, powerful &amp; consistent.<br /><br />Before I ordered from him, I looked around and some other Nbome vendors seemed to have issues laying (dosing) the blotters evenly, according to various comments in the forum. He was singled out as a notable exception.<br /><br />If only he sold 25b too...!

Got a bit derailed snorting 1x 25i with 1x 25c...<br /><br />Certainly didn&#039;t stop me going back for more tho&nbsp; ;)

				I can&#039;t tell you who has the better product as I always buy from Tyler.<br /><br />There a good reason why I have only buy from him, The product is also high quality and consistent.<br />Also ships the same day as you order, great packaging and he always gives you more then you order.<br />He is my favorite vendor on SR.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />

				I ordered from t5 and his stuff is very potent, 1 tab really gets you tripping, 2 was to much for me I wouldn&#039;t do that again, I start to get vascocontriction in my legs.&nbsp; his prices can&#039;t be beat, he ran out of stock after I ordered but he communicated this situation and still got it out in a teasonable amount of time.

				Ive bought only from Tyl3r, both 25i/c/combo. My people went crazy on i/c, he mess up the blotters so he didnt know which one was 25i/c, so well, i dont really know which one was that, but according to him the 25c was by far more aclaimed by my friends.<br />&nbsp;Anyways, this time ive bought to nevita, so, i&#039;&#039;ll&nbsp; bump this whenever those arrive and update on test. cheers<br />Next time im thinkin on T5 custom tabs, want to do custom dosage like 1.600ug 25i, or 1200 25c, something like that.

				Well first time went with tyl3r 25c/i, now ive went with nevita, will update later but, i think the guy has a the most selling on 25c than 25i, so that keep me fine at least cuz this time i went for 25c.<br />&nbsp;I think next time i&#039;ll try T5 custom dosage for both 25i/c or at least one and make a bulk order of superb blotters.

				IMHO, Nevita, hands down.<br /><br />Right now, his shipping time is nearly triple what it used to be, but the amount extra he sends is insane.<br /><br />Not to mention quality. You can go to his thread and see my post. The shit is mind blowing, and I have tons of experience with NBOMe&#039;s. <br /><br />I did enjoy the 1-week shipping time from T5, but the product was unimpressive, for me anyway. 2 and 3-hit 25C trips were short lived and fairly unimpressive. There was definite color shifting, tri-color halos tracing almost everything along with minor shifting and morphing of objects. But it took a hit of DOC added to the mix to really get me where I wanted to be... I&#039;ve nearly lost my mind on Nevita&#039;s 25C in the past. I was literally swimming in the stars. I clearly remember the first time I tried his 25C, after coming back to Earth, my girl and I had a blast running around the beach with Indian-esque rainbow colored patterns overlaying the field of view and we both looked like green-skinned zombies to each other, skin hanging off and all. Hilarious time.<br /><br />And the 25i is no different in terms of quality. Oh, and I always hold the blotter in my mouth, sublingually/buccally, without swallowing for 45 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />So that&#039;s my 2 cents. I&#039;d go Nevita, every time. Unless shipping time is a major factor for you right now. But who knows, he might be back to the 1-week average soon.
