				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to SR, was browsing and just wanted to get a feel of how secure people feel on here.<br /><br />I was considering purchasing some items (should they surface on the forum) and was also wondering the safety of shipping to Norway.<br /><br />The post here have a habit of confiscating packages; is there anyone here from Norway who has had some good experiences buying items on the site?<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if this is the right place for this thread...but thanks in advance!

				Well have you ever ordered anything legally on the internet? Because that&#039;s what the package looks like when it arrives at your door. Unless the delivery service rips you package to shreds it could be a box of DVDs in there for all they know...

				use gpg for your communications and you are generally safe. I have heard a mixed bag of customs info about the Nordic track, but a vendor I used to be close with had no problems getting acid and DMT into there.

				Gpg is really nice and it certainly helps to secure your communications but, there are other things that can be done.&nbsp; <br /><br />For instance, I wouldn&#039;t purchase anything from my own country.&nbsp; Its too easy for LEO to setup up a Vendors account.&nbsp; Sit back and just fill orders for his country.&nbsp; Then when he gets a couple hundred names and addresses go in for the bust.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think LEO is only a real threat if you order from your own country.&nbsp; I believe by, only ordering from other countries, you can defeat this tactic.&nbsp; <br /><br />By ordering from other countries you do have customs to deal with.&nbsp; However, between the excellent packaging here on SR and the fact that you can play dumb on the first package from customs makes this a much better choice in my mind.&nbsp;

Not in terms of LE but in terms of actually getting your package intact: having to deal with customs means a greater likelihood of the package being seized. That could come to you in the form of a disguised LE, it might not, but either way you&#039;re out a package. No dealing with customs when you order domestically...that&#039;s why searching domestically only is an option on SR: I would only order from a foreign seller if their product couldn&#039;t be matched here. I don&#039;t believe LE are legally allowed to sell drugs over the internet, in the pursuit of &quot;nabbing&quot; people for buying drugs. Perhaps the DEA could pull nonsense like that, but it doesn&#039;t look like they&#039;re involved here.

				Why would LEO waste their time with someone buying relatively small amounts of drugs, when it&#039;s especially hard to prove you actually wanted them and someone wasn&#039;t using your address as a drop. Now, if someone come to your door and asks you to sign for something I&#039;d be suspicious and say I wasn&#039;t expecting anything. Just picking your mail up, there&#039;s plausible deniability. So really the only way I can see LEO setting you up is if you&#039;re trying to buy a kilo of coke or something worth busting you for. Also, in country, quick through the mail no customs. My 2 cents.

				I have been weighing the same situation as some other people in this forum<br /><br />Domestic vs International.. what is safer?<br /><br />Domestic advantages - no customs, packages not from freakin India and Colombia <br />International advantage - LE is probably not coordinating internationally to bust your 5gram coke order

				Ugh, Scandinavian countries have always been a trouble :S Some vendors say every 1/2, 1/5 or 1/10 package gets lost. Of course that&#039;s just speculation on their part, but generally SR packages are well thought out and they&#039;re practically undetectable. Also people, don&#039;t think that Your government is honey potting You, if You have a chance of good quality of Your choice, then order domestic, if not order internationally. Domestic is faster&amp;safer. International has more options that domestic, but is slower&amp;riskier.<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I have had the same issue initially but i have order mades from 3 different vendors now and everything great. Just be careful on quality and look for reliable vendors with decent packaging. Always read through to see if anyone has complained about this and ask make a more valued decision on who you buy off.<br /><br />fish

				international or domestic depends on what you are shipping. (in the US)they need a warrant to open mail, so shipping LSD, and properly packaged other things will be hard to get a warrant to open it, but shipping from overseas is more likely to net you a love letter first time (I can&#039;t link to a completely credible source for this info), but they don&#039;t need any warrant to search, so if it is badly packaged, they can open it right away, where domestically, they have to have a signed judge order (or DNR present) to open it, but it would likely yield charges where the overseas would get you a warning. risk&lt;=&gt;reward

				well&#039; that might have happened, but I have never heard of it for domestic shipments in the US, because they need a warrant to open it. I have heard of people getting notices to collect an order at the PO because it was damaged and had something leaking out of it, but I have never heard of a &quot;love letter&quot; for a domestic shipment. All I have ever heard about domestically is a CD based on a damaged package or a warrant from an ongoing investigation.
