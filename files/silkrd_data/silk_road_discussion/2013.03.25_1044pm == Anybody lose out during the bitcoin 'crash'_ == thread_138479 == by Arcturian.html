				Just wondering if anyone sold their coins during the crash (If thats what you want to call it, im calling it a crash for contexts sake, it wasnt a real crash) at the low points of market price. I think the lowest was £31 (47$). I stuck with it with great outcome and sold at £48, (72$) , £3 more then i was expecting before i even knew about the &#039;crash&#039;. They reached a high of £52 earlier and the outcome is looking good at the time of posting this :)

				When I first started on the road, I bought bitcoins for 6 Euro and thought that&#039;s what they cost more or less all the time until I realised they rise and fall. I must have bought them during a major crash and when I was buying again they were at 8 and I waited to see if they&#039;d fall a bit being stingy. Have bought and used more since and even saw my account rise enough to buy a gram of coke for free!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />So pricey now and thought about buying to make some money but not sure how secure they are with such a fast rise recently. Will kick myself if they hit 100+ soon which they probably will!

				I sold out sadly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Panicked and stupid.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck. <br /><br />I&#039;m quite depressed about it. Been smoking a lot of dope. Lol.&nbsp; I got BTC app on the phone that keeps telling me the current price and how stupid I was to sell .&nbsp; Arrrg<br /><br />It&#039;s waaay too scary to buy coins at the current inflated price. Unless you use a trigger limit to buy and sell coins automatically with money in an exchange account.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s the country of Cypress and their financial disaster that is doing this.&nbsp; They wil all pull out and sell off coins in a few months when they all find new banks for their money outside of Cypress.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be all at once , they will do it day by day. . . Coins will drop from May - July&nbsp; down to about what they are really worth, maybe $35. Each<br /><br />Notes to self:&nbsp; &nbsp;Any financial disaster can happen anytime anywhere and floods of people buying Into coins at the same time,&nbsp; as the government locks up banks.

				Lost a good few $ with an order I made sitting in escrow for a month. The order never arrived and I was refunded 100%. The amount was $280 which could easily have been at least twice that if it was sitting in my account instead of in escrow!<br /><br />
