				I assume everyone knows already that these posts are scams? However there will always be that new person getting sucked into giving away their money SO DON&#039;T TRUST THEM. <br /><br />Hopefully everyone knows this and I am just blowing off some steam. I noticed you guys added a captcha for posting which I thought was a great idea and now it seems someone has coded themselves a way around that shit. And here I was thanking God that I could actually read the captchas, you know... A good solution might be to code in a random changer on the captcha types so 30 (50 or more maybe 100?) so different capctchas types and styles show up randomly to throw off the bot this guy is using, including captchas that only autistic people can read (this might be the real solution to the problem) which is fine with me I&#039;m used to trying to decipher an incredibly hard-to-read capcha it is annoying but not as annoying as these posts.<br /><br />Anyway it is great to be back on SR,&nbsp; I see some captchas in clearnet that are so Egyptian I often wonder how far the captcha reading programs have come, and somebody out there must have them so.... perhaps coding random styles and types along with the randomizing of the style used for each post is an even better solution.

				or just add a few dashes and change it up whenever there is a need that seems to work, still though what happens when whoever is spamming the forums adopts a more sophisticated program. I well.... I have already ran out of fucks to give and am in a slightly bad mood now because of bitinstant has gone full retard on me.

				They must be catching some people out otherwise they would not be so persistent. I&#039;ve only been a mod for week and they post faster than I can delete, it&#039;d be great if the mods could just ban these obvious shill spammerscammer accounts.
