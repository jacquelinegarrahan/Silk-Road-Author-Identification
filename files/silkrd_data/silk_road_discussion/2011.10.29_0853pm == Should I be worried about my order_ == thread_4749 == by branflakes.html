				I made an order with a (reputable) vendor 5 days ago. Its status is &quot;processing&quot; which is to be expected. I have sent a few messages to the vendor, including my address so the order can be sent out, but I haven&#039;t heard anything back at all. All of my messages have been read though and the vendor has also updated their seller&#039;s page so it&#039;s apparent they are around. :-\<br /><br />I feel like the vendor doesn&#039;t want to do business with me because they haven&#039;t even responded back to acknowledge my order. Do you guys think I should cancel it or sit on it for a few more days?

				If they are not answering I would probably just cancel it, because they should either send it, canceled your order if there is an issue, or at least sent you a message letting you know what is up.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				You can always cancel and re-order if the vendor actually gets a hold of you.&nbsp; If it&#039;s a reputable vendor I&#039;m sure they have a good reason for not responding (some vendors say right on their profile page not to PM then until at least 7 days after item has been marked shipped).<br /><br />But if it bugs you that much, cancel the order and send them a PM telling them why.&nbsp; If enough people do it, that&#039;s the market telling the vendor to get their shit together on shipping times or lose some serious money.&nbsp; They will either smarten up or another seller offering better service will come along and take their business - and you will be better off for it.

				Ha, yea just a tad faster this time. (First time for everything) <br />But you make a wonderful point about being politely vocal, so people vendors know what the common respectful approach is too handling orders. <br />It also helps this meritocracy be truer. Virtues, Good Practice, and a of course quality product means one will make a wonderful name for themselves as some have all ready. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
