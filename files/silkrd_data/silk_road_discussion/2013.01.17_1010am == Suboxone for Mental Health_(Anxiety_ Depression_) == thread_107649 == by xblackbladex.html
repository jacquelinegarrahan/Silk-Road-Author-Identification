				When nothing else works(all psychotropic medications), could suboxone be a viable option for treating chronic depression and anxiety? It is safer than other opiates in the sense that it&#039;s harder to develop a tolerance and is harder to abuse. It has a very long half life. Any testimonials?

				bupe does have great anti anxiety properties but getting yourself hooked on a very strong opiod to treat anxiety is probably the most stupid thing I ever&nbsp; heard. look into CBT, eat healthy food, meditate, exercise, these will all improve your mental health rather than rely on a drug. which in the long run will make you feel ten times worse, especially when you try to get off them.

				As far as you are concerned, I AM A DOCTOR. I am not getting into a debate I just want to know if anyone else has found that it has therapeutic effects for mental disorders. I personally have found that taking it sparingly when needed is far more effective than other shorter lasting opiates. It doesn&#039;t put a ware on me like other opiates do, and it allows for a good 2-3 days of relief due to its long half life. Very nice to use on stressful days.

				I also stated very clearly that I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A DEBATE. <br />I stated this before any of the madness started. <br />Ready?<br /><br />BEFORE ANY OF THE MADNESS STARTED. <br />BEFORE ANY OF THE MADNESS STARTED. <br />BEFORE ANY OF THE MADNESS STARTED. <br /><br />Good let the moderator check to see if there were any edits, because there weren&#039;t. <br />Now go away and cause drama somewhere else.<br />

My depression happens to be bipolar depression, and a mood stabilizer has been a serious help in that respect. Not all depression is depression, it can be a sign of a mood disorder. Regardless, talk to your doctor. If you must try a substance here for treating depression, i would recommend MDMA. It&#039;s like forced joy for a few hours, it really helps<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />MDMA is the complete opposite of what I need. Nobody knows my body like I do. I sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of advice, more as an inquiry to see if anyone else has found success from the approach I found most viable to take.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wait look at that! I actually stated twice that I didn&#039;t want advice! Did I say I sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of advice? Is that what it says? Is that what it says?<br /><br />I sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of advice<br />I sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of advice<br />I sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of advice<br />I sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of advice<br /><br />You didn&#039;t get it the first time so maybe I&#039;ll just slip a little<br /><br />I sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of adviceI sincerely appreciate your input but I am not making this thread in search of advice<br /><br />in there. <br /><br /><br />;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Now lets see if you can read. Try reading your post to me right after that one where you are completely condescending for no reason. Again, you are a jackass <br /><br />Also let&#039;s note that said advice was given before your statement of no advice.
