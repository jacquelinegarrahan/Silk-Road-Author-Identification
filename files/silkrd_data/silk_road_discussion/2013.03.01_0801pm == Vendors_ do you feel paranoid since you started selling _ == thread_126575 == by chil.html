				So, since I was thinking to start vending at some point in the future, I was wondering if paranoia was something inevitable to a dealer&#039;s life. <br />Can the anxiety be avoided or it is the just the price to pay for dealing drugs ?

				I just sent out some of my first packages this week, and I would be lying if I said I wasn&#039;t a bit paranoid about it.<br /><br />As long as you use legit packaging/stealth and keep it anonymous however, the risk is fairly minimal imo.<br /><br />There are certain advantages SR has over dealing IRL. Don&#039;t have to deal with people who might try to rob you or just flat out never pay you if you front. Don&#039;t have to worry about one of your &quot;friends&quot; or other customers ratting you out if they get busted. You don&#039;t have to deal&nbsp; with any sketchy situation the street might bring. Instead all you really have to worry about is a package not making it to its destination or a customer trying to scam you and say it never arrived.<br /><br />That being said, I think most vendors will always have to deal with a degree of paranoia. But if you play it safe it can be minimized.

				I am pretty paranoid. Having prior police contact affects that also. When the dogs go beserk, I get worried, but it&#039;s generally nothing. The police have to jump through a lot of hoops to get to you. If you are watching your 6, it wouldn&#039;t matter anyways because you won&#039;t keep a lot of product on hand.
