				It&#039;s no question that most people here aren&#039;t satisfied at the prospect of replacing SR with sheep or bmr. We need a more secure, more selective service to last for the next few years. Here are some features I think would be useful on a SR successor.<br /><br />1. Instead of having a register account link on the main page, there should be a link titled how to join which points to a guide on how to use the anonymous market safely, which explains things like how to use pgp, make sure javascript and plugins are disabled, not trust anyone on the site and not keep funds on the site for more than 12 hours.<br />2. Every user, vendor or cusomer should be required to provide his pgp public key when registering and all pms automatically encripted with the receiving user&#039;s public key. All users would then have to copy the pms they receive and decrypt them on their local machine. This way no one other than the vendors will ever have access to any addresses or other private info. PMs should also be automatically deleted after 14 days so in case a vendor gets busted and his private key is compromised, his customers will still be safe.<br />3. Sellers should be a able to rate buyers as well as this make it almost impossible for scammers to blackmail sellers with fake feedback.<br />4. Buyers with completed transactions totaling below $100 should be required to FE by default. Same way, vendors that require FE from reputable users should be banned.<br />5. In the early stages of the new website, vendor registration should be invite only and only established and reputable SR vendors should be allowed to join to ensure the credibility of the new service.<br /><br />Interested in other ideas, comments on mine. Maybe someone will actually take them into account and build a better and safer anonymous market. The Silk Road is an idea and the feds must understand that ideas don&#039;t die, but they evolve.

				Really? no ideas? come on, don&#039;t tell me you buy into that SR 2.0 crap. SR is never coming back and those that try to bring it back are amateurs who want to cash in on the popularity of the name.

But you&#039;re right about all the published 2.0 attempts so far, people have no idea what they&#039;re getting themselves in to. I hope this next one when he chooses to release it (I think he is publishing either himself or through an admin I don&#039;t know yet) will not disappoint but from the screenshots I&#039;ve seen it is impressive unlike the others so far.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Who are we talking about St? <br /><br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				Both sheep and bmr are hosted on crappy servers. I think that&#039;s the first thing to consider: fast servers outside the FBI&#039;s grip.<br />Also, the dev(s) should fucking test for information leaks, make sure they know their configuration files at all times, keep backup copies of config files like php.ini and httpd.conf on a flash drive taped to their fucking dicks. The feds are getting smarter, we have to keep up.

				I have a feature request.<br /><br />Have the new one not make any references to SR, such as SR 2.0, DPR Jr, or any other similarly stupid shit.
