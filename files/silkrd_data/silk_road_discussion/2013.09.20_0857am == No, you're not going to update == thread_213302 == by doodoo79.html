				I am so tired of still reading reviews that say&quot;will update after trying.&quot; No you won&#039;t, because you can&#039;t. Here&#039;s what you do; go ahead and leave a 5 if your product got to you and it is what it&#039;s supposed to be. You don&#039;t have to leave a written review at this point. From that point on any time you visit that vendor&#039;s page, right under his/her name there will be 4 options written in green instead of 3. You&#039;ll see the normal &quot;message&quot;, &quot;discuss&quot;, and &quot;report&quot; buttons but until you&#039;ve left your written review there will also be a fourth button written in green that says, you guessed it, &quot;review&quot;. I&#039;ve never understood why some folks are so eager just to write something, anything, for a review. Here&#039;s one I love; &quot;FE. Will update later.&quot; If you leave that you&#039;re stupid for two reasons; you left that useless review and you FE&#039;d. I&#039;m just saying that it doesn&#039;t help the community to leave a review with no useful information in it and you&#039;re not gonna be able to change it at a later date. So just hold your horses, give your product a test drive around the block, and THEN come back and leave your review (if you wanna be useful). Have a great day and I love all of you.

				Hey doodoo- thanks for this post- as a new buyer i was unsure about the best way to go- but it is important to me that 1- i finalize promptly and 2- give honest feedback/review- for two reasons- first to benefit the vendor and second- i am making my purchase based on the reviews i can find- if these are not honest and correct and accurate- i might be wasting my money<br />so -thanks for this- it also might be valuable info for those in newbie forum

				I agree mostly. <br />If you are nervous about the vendor, It might be good to warn people about FE requirements with a review like:<br />&quot;FE&#039;d, will update in the discussion.&quot;<br /><br />Can you leave a text review before choosing one of the 6 permanent rating choices? If not, the rating is the thing I would not do before the product arrives. So, if that, then discussion would be the place to voice nervousness about the vendor doing something that seems too good to be true or sketchy. Be aware, choosing the 6th rating option (no rating) is permanent. Just don&#039;t accept one if you want to rate later.<br />

				I was hoping the new review/feedback system would help facilitate the process of a) releasing funds to the vendor, then - after actually trying the product - b) giving a rating, writing a review.

People just like to comment early sometimes. And, people sometimes accidentally leave a permanent &#039;no rating&#039; when they intend to do it later. SR will hopefully make it easier to avoid accidentally doing that.

				I always think: &quot;Oh my god, what an idiot.&quot; I have made FE with the new feedback system because of my favorite vendor that has never disappointed me and probably will never and I just send him the funds, waited, then when it arrived I wrote a review. Simple.<br />First I thought it sucks that you can not edit anymore, but now I think why should you want to edit?

				Buyers just need to detail their reveiws a ton more. Talk about communication. Talk about stealth/packaging/shipping. Talk about whatever concerns you had and when or if they were fixed. That&#039;s what should be in the review section, not some garbage about FE&#039;ing.<br /><br />I see a bunch of &quot;5/5 awesome&quot; or &quot;solid solid solid&quot; or &quot;haven&#039;t tested but 5/5 otherwise&quot;. NO! You don&#039;t leave a review until the product has been tested, you&#039;ve received it, and you&#039;ve reflected on how your purchase went and what the vendor deserves to know how awesome their stuff is. And if you didn&#039;t get satistfaction, you PM vendor before leaving a review. Vendors can&#039;t expect funds to be released immediately after their shipment is shown as delivered, either. Sellers and buyers both have lives, and it&#039;s not always possible to mark the shipment as received the day it comes in the mail.<br /><br />Enough with thiis &quot;FE for trusted vendor&quot; before their package even arrives! I swear, people probably finalize right after ordering!

				The new feedback system is good, and now we are used to it, and slightly change our reviewing practices, it works. BUT there should STILL be the ability to change your LAST, MOST RECENT rating and/or review with a vendor.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite everyone saying don&#039;t FE, we all knows it goes on and is the most common way of a vendor performing exit scam. We NEED a buyer to be able to inform us he has FE&#039;d and then we NEED him to be able to change that when/if the package arrives. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously writing &#039;Fe will update&#039; is pointless now but under old system it was valid, and an informative part of feedback for other buyers who could see if it changed to &quot;hooray drugs arrived&quot; OR &quot;hmmm no it come yet vendor is stringing me along with promises&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This useful aspect needs reinstating to protect new buyers. It doesn&#039;t affect me at all as I don&#039;t need to FE, but still, the other week I had a package come and immediately finalised and left 5 as I couldn&#039;t use it for a few days. When I came to try the drugs they were terrible. (I was able to resolve amicably with vendor). It was annoying not to be able to change rating. Yes I could have written a scathing review but it wouldn&#039;t effect vendors rating.

				We should be a little bit careful to condemn here - this sounds like it could be a case of sample error, in that it seems we&#039;re making a judgment based on what is seen while not considering what is unseen (thanks M. Bastiat). We see the 6 month old reviews stating &quot;will update after trying&quot; and it&#039;s easy to assume that the site is swarming with idiots who leave these kinds of reviews and never actually do update - the multitude of plainly unamended reviews are proof of that. What we DON&#039;T see is the people who wrote the same kind of review, and then updated it. Given the old feedback system, it wasn&#039;t a bad idea to review immediately after finalising - whether FEing or upon receiving the item - the site prompted you to review at that point, may as well, and you could always change it later. I guess many people did this, while many others forgot about their intentions. Sure, there are probably a few dunderheads who unthinkingly write &quot;will update after...&quot; yet never do, but I suspect a lot of people who wrote such reviews in the past fully intended to update, but life got in the way, the importance of giving a precise evaluation of their $50 worth of whatever receded, and they just overlooked it for that particular purchase. <br /><br />I&#039;d wager a lot of the people still giving 5 star reviews without trying the item or having FE&#039;d aren&#039;t dummies - they either haven&#039;t got the memo about the new feedback rules or are just creatures of habit. They may not pay so much attention to the workings of the site and the changes that have been made to the feedback system - maybe they don&#039;t spend much or any time on the forum, for instance - so they just keep on doing what they&#039;ve always done. <br /><br />Anyway, let&#039;s not forget that a lot of the punters here probably view this site as nothing more than a place to perform a transaction. It&#039;s not that surprising, is it? When we buy a pack of gum from a 7-11, most of us don&#039;t assume it necessary to adhere to codes of conduct or behavioural expectations beyond those that are generally imposed by civil society. This forum is a community of sorts, but the trading floor is nothing more or nothing less than that; a place where buying and selling is the main and overriding concern. The only obligation a buyer has is to pay in full for what they&#039;ve bought within a timeframe agreed upon by buyer and seller - and I suspect this is the only obligation that many buyers would consider relevant. They don&#039;t view the site as an ideologically-motivated endeavour. They may not be so concerned about the rigorous maintenance of the systems of self-regulation necessary in light of the fact that we don&#039;t have recourse to impartial processes of arbitration and dispute resolution. They want to buy, and get what they paid for. The end. <br /><br />Would the site be better off without this kind of buyer? I&#039;d argue no, it wouldn&#039;t be. Let&#039;s not be too harsh on them.

It&#039;s not that surprising, is it? When we buy a pack of gum from a 7-11, most of us don&#039;t assume it necessary to adhere to codes of conduct or behavioural expectations beyond those that are generally imposed by civil society. This forum is a community of sorts, but the trading floor is nothing more or nothing less than that; a place where buying and selling is the main and overriding concern. The only obligation a buyer has is to pay in full for what they&#039;ve bought within a timeframe agreed upon by buyer and seller - and I suspect this is the only obligation that many buyers would consider relevant. They don&#039;t view the site as an ideologically-motivated endeavour. They may not be so concerned about the rigorous maintenance of the systems of self-regulation necessary in light of the fact that we don&#039;t have recourse to impartial processes of arbitration and dispute resolution. They want to buy, and get what they paid for. The end. <br />Would the site be better off without this kind of buyer? I&#039;d argue no, it wouldn&#039;t be. Let&#039;s not be too harsh on them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Agreed. For some, perhaps most, buyers, the market is just an Amazon for Drugs. While this attitude may place unreasonable expectations on vendors (usually, I think, part-time sole traders doing their best to secure illegal goods and sneak them safely through national and international postage systems) I doubt we can get away from the fact that in a browser, TORed or not, one shopping site feels much like another and provokes much the same instinctual behaviour.
