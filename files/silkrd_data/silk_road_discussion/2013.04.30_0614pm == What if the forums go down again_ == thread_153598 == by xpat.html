				I know some of us have the emails to vendors we&#039;ve worked with for a while but what if the forums go down again with the road? Twas a pretty dark time earlier. As well, a lot of the vendors utilize tormail for their non SR communication and it seems over the last month that tormail has become increasing spotty in service, with it going back down today.<br /><br />Thought/ ideas anybody?

				I wish I had some great idea, but it seems that the whole SR process is coming undone. Obtaining BTC anonymously is becoming harder and harder as the government is cracking down on BTC vendors, then you have tormail which has been less than reliable lately(as we speak it is down again), then of course the issues with SR. <br /><br />I hate to say it but I think our time here is coming to end, as far as the site runs and operates today. The options I see are Vendors forming their own small site or possibly taking a few loyal customers and going PGP via clearnet emails. <br /><br />I know for some people this site disappearing will be a painful transition. Like someone said in another post the casual users or the weekend user will just move on, but from what I have read there seems to be a whole group of regular opiate users that will not be in good shape if the road goes.

				I think more people should move to a clearnet email account entirely created and only accessed through tor, that mixed with PGP seems, to my limited knowledge, a decent way of anonymous and reliable communication.<br /><br />I really wish and hope that either vendors will come together or someone will make a thread similar to the PGP public key one with vendor info on it while the forums are still up.<br /><br />If the forums go down again, the majority of us on here are fucked and will be completely out of the loop.<br /><br />This community is something we&#039;ve all worked too hard for and it is unreasonable to tie our existence as a community, revolution, and idea simply to two .onion sites.<br /><br />We need back up, we need other solutions, and we need them now.<br /><br /><br />We&#039;re (collectively) an intelligent bunch, we should be able to think of something.
