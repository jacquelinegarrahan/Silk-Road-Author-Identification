				I apologize for the stupid question, but i just placed my first order with old amsterdam about 36 hours ago but forgot to encrypt my address. from what ive read he is usually very quick to respond and so i wonder, since i didnt encrypt my address did he just ignore my order or is he just a busy man. I really hope i dont have to wait three days to cancer and reorder

				thank you for your friendliness christy, i guess i just have to hold tight and wait. i suppose if he was going to do anything he would just cancel my order next time i will use pgp for sure. its not quite as complicated as i thought at first. once again thanks for your friendliness

				Those who stress hard about that shit need only worry if SR is run by Big Brother because TOR has an excellent system of encryption people don&#039;t give them at The TOR Project enough credit for instilling in their system.<br /><br />It&#039;s not run by The MAN, your safe buddy, and it&#039;s deleted immediately upon completion anyway from DPR&#039;s system.<br /><br />TOR&nbsp; was originally designed for US diplomats in locations such as Iran to send secure communications to one another. It&#039;s a bitter irony for them that same system has been turned on it&#039;s head and is now being used to defeat them in their disastrous war on drugs, or as many in the Libertarian movement call, the war on SOME drugs.<br /><br />It&#039;s encrypted immediately for your convenience and SR&#039;s servers are probably like WikiLeaks and in a secure ex-military bunker somewhere.<br /><br />Relax, enjoy your drugs and remember to use it next time if you are a little on the paranoid side.<br /><br />CheshireCat says &quot;Welcome to Wonderland&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D

				None of us knows if/when SR might become compromised.&nbsp; It&#039;s best not to take any chances and encrypt your address.
