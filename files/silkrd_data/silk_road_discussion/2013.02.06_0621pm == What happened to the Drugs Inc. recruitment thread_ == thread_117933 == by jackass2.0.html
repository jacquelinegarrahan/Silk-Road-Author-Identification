				I mean the guys from the documentary...<br /><br /><br />Did anyone apply? How much do they pay? Initially I thought this was a stupid idea, but since SR staff recently made just too many stupid (dumb, not thought through at all) decisions I thought this might be a good opportunity to put some pressure on this regime. <br />I have been on the Road for over a year and I have seen it all. All the scams, all the spam with clueless forum admins, scammers returning, SR not giving a shit, great drugs, crap drugs. The good, the bad and mostly the ugly. I&#039;d paint a realistic picture of this place, although not exactly a great one, but a fair one. I am on my way out, now that they don&#039;t want small/short time vendors anymore, I am seriously considering this if the pay is right. <br /><br />Can someone point me to that thread? Or Pm me.

Seriously though, I don&#039;t know about nat geo, but discovery channel pays a meagre sum.. probably not worth it imo<br />
