				I have an order in the resolution center that is due in 22hours.<br />I asked for an extension.<br />Is this because the seller did not respond to it?<br />What happens after that?<br />I do not want my stats get messed up with auto finalize neither do I wanna hold the sellers bitcoins.<br /><br />Product did not show up, seller has a really good rep but is hard to get a hold of lately but is active on the forum.<br /><br />cheers

				yes its cause the seller didnt accept the extension<br /><br />if you dont come to an agreement before its due then support will look at it and decide what to do - generally they will extend it to give extra time to wait for it to arrive or for you to solve the issue with the seller<br /><br />eventually if you ask for a refund and the seller fails to respond they generally will accept your refund you suggest if its reasonable<br /><br />you dont have to worry about A-F now because its in resolution

				So I got another item in resolution center that is extended by 14 days and that extension is due in: 24 hrs.<br />WHat happens after that if I do not release payment?<br /><br />The seller looked into it and came to the conclusion he forget to send my order out and he said it would ship this week but it is friday and nothing arrived yet and the extension is due in 24hrs.<br /><br />I asked for another extension in the resolution center.<br /><br />thanks
