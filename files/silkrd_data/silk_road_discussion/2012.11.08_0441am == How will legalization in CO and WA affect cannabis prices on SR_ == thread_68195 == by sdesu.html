				As many of you know, residents of Washington and Colorado have voted to regulate marijuana like alcohol for adults 21+. With these new laws, there is no doubt marijuana prices will drop as a result, the question is, how will this affect marijuana vendors here on Silk Road? I just read an interesting article on the HuffingtonPost regarding this (not about SR). What do you think? <br /><br />Link: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/legalizing-marijuana-washington-colorado_n_2088375.html<br /><br />Full text article:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />Legalizing Marijuana In Washington And Colorado Could Decrease Cost For Users<br /><br />In a huge victory for the pro-pot movement, Washington and Colorado became the first states in the U.S. to legalize marijuana for recreational use on Tuesday. The unprecedented win could bring even more welcome news for marijuana users, as some say that legal pot could also mean cheaper pot for consumers.<br /><br />Thatâ€™s right -- many speculate that the price of marijuana will go down significantly as the industry enters a new legal environment. A report by Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a non-profit lobbying group working to legalize marijuana, shows that legal marijuana in an open market could cost as little as $3 an ounce -- 100 times less than its current price of about $300 (H/t: Slate).<br /><br />A decrease in prices would be partly due to the fact that it would cost substantially less to grow marijuana in a legal environment. Without fear of getting punished criminally, pot producers could eliminate the costs of growing marijuana in secret. Marijuana could cost as little as 20 cents per pound to produce, according to Slate.<br /><br />But the real cost of marijuana will of course be impacted by how the states decide to tax pot on the open market. In Washington, marijuana will be taxed at the steep rate of 25 percent three times over, with the tax being charged when the grower sells it to the processor, when the processor sells it to the retailer and when the retailer sells it to the user, CNN Money reports. Estimates indicate that the state stands to earn $500 million in tax revenue, according to WPTV.<br /><br />In Colorado, taxes won&#039;t be as harsh as in Washington. Amendment 64 limits taxes to 15 percent of the wholesale price of marijuana through 2017. The Colorado Center on Law and Policy estimates that marijuana sales would generate as much as $60 million a year in tax revenue for the state, the Denver Post reports.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to predict how demand could change now that marijuana is legal, which makes it tough to estimate exactly how much prices with change, the Associated Press reports.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s difficult to size up a market even if it&#039;s legal, certainly if it&#039;s illegal,&quot; Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard University economist who has studied the national tax implications of the legalization of several drugs told the AP.<br /><br />During the Prohibition Era (1920 - 1933) when alcohol was illegal, the price of the banned substance increased substantially, according to the Economic History Association. Despite the uptick on price, Americans were hardly deterred from drinking as U.S. consumption of alcohol hardly declined went down. Today, many regard the &quot;noble experiment&quot; as a complete failure. Prohibition not only removed a significant source of tax revenue, but it increase government spending and led many drinkers to switch to more dangerous substances like cocaine, the Cato Institute Policy Analysis reports.<br /><br />Although the passing of Amendment 64 will make it legal immediately for Colorado adults to possess, grow, consume and give away marijuana, it could take almost a year before pot is sold in stores, the Colorado Independent reports. Seeing marijuana on store shelves could take as long as a year in Washington as well.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Unlikely to happen in reality, but incredible that it is possible! I could literally flood the market here where I am with good quality unsprayed weed for next to nothing and force the gangs to drop their prices and improve their quality, benefiting all Irish cannabis users. That, or I could pocket $477 profit on every ounce I sell and make $1.8 million per year. Oh the possibilities!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Seriously great news though; I look forward to the first batch of WA and CO sellers and the price : quality ratio they can bring to buyers here.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				The only thing I see disappearing on the road once the legalization hits (Jan 1, 2013) is that all the small gram sales vendors disappear.&nbsp; Who the fuck pays 25 a gram anyway?&nbsp; If you are willing to pay 25 a gram please shoot me a message as I have a plethora of product to offer haha.<br /><br />The only real life thing that will affect prices in the near future is if the Feds have any say in it.&nbsp; If the Feds have a say expect your prices to stay the same on SR, if they have a shot in the dark at enforcing their bullshit law expect prices to drop.&nbsp; I have hopes that the supply will completely overwhelm the demand in the near future.&nbsp; Have your coins ready to spend at the appropriate place is the only thing I can recommend :)

				God i love my state, 1000$ prices for a permit to grow. the only problem is the goverment taxes it. and it is also 40% tax at the cannabis stores that are going to open up. The only problem is that the feds are going to be all over this because marijuana is still illegal to the federal government

				They&#039;ll stay the same. Granted supply will be greater but with the demand to more than match that supply there&#039;s no reason for prices to drop. Was and is the same thing with medical - patients are paying prices for medical mj that are a direct result of the street market&#039;s dictation. Legalization won&#039;t change a thing for prices. It just means more supply and more demand.

				If there is a greater supply than there is demand, the price will go down.&nbsp; I doubt that will happen, however, as the prices in the rest of the country will remain stagnant, which will create demand for the weed in medical, or recreational states. Also, considering that the DEA is still planning on enforcing federal law on medicinal and recreational marijuana states, there is still quite a bit of risk for growers/sellers in these areas.<br /><br />I do not foresee any substantial drop in prices due to decrim measures in these states. It would be nice, though.

				Probably won&#039;t change that drastically...the numbers on there are a bit screwy anyway.....20 cents a pound? Shit trimmers alone get $200 for trimming a pound and any grower will tell you that growing and harvesting *good* bud is labor intensive.<br /><br />-mm

				The article that you posted is all speculation, and since Marijuana historically, and technically still, is an illegal substance, measuring supply and demand has always been daunting. $3 an ounce is an outlandish claim though, for the amount of time and resources that goes into growing and harvest weed, nobody will ever sell at $3 an ounce, it just wouldn&#039;t be worth it. <br /><br />For starters, everyone is all excited about CO &amp; WA legalizing weed but nobody is acknowledging that Federally, weed is still illegal, and Federal law always trumps state law. In California, medical marijuana has been legal since 1996 and it goes a little like this: if you are operating within the scope of California law (you have your medical marijuana card &amp; you are in possession of the legal limit or less), local authorities will leave you alone. HOWEVER, at any time, for no reason at all, the DEA, a federal government entity, can step in and charge you for violating federal law. <br /><br />Up north in the Emerald Triangle, where it is legal to grow 99 plants under county ordinance, I heard many stories about medical marijuana growers who were operating within the scope of the law and would get federally raided by the DEA. In fact, it&#039;s pretty much is a cost of doing business in the medical marijuana industry. Retail stores take expected theft into consideration when financially planning; they know they are going to have merchandise stolen so they allocate inventory and make adjustments to expected profit accordingly...equally so, anyone operating in the open in the medical marijuana industry in CA needs to put money aside for a lawyer because if the DEA wants to come take you down, they will, and you need to be ready to fight it.<br /><br />So even though everyone is all excited about this alleged legalization in CO &amp; WA, the truth is, we have NO IDEA what is going to happen in the next 12 months. What you can count on is this: people aren&#039;t going to be setting up farms and growing out in the open, at least, not if they are smart. The DEA has a track record of not interfering with state laws one year, and then the next year raiding everybody.<br /><br />Just pulled up another article, thought this quote was relevant:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">President Obama&#039;s former senior drug policy advisor said that if the marijuana initiatives pass, a war will be incited between the federal government and the states that pass them. &quot;Once these states actually try to implement these laws, we will see an effort by the feds to shut it down,&quot; Sabet said.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I doubt it will affect the price. Ive been to dispensaries where its legal in CA and AZ. The price is no bargain compared to street prices. Actually a little more expensive from what I noticed. Roughly $40-50 an 1/8th and you dont get any deals for buying bulk. Well, you arent allowed to buy bulk. By the way, MA legalized too for all of us weed lovers. Its spreading fast.&nbsp; ;D Also, is it me or does it seem as though bud prices on SR have dropped somewhat recently anyways? Maybe because its harvest time. Im lovin it. Found some for $12 a gram!

				Damn I am very interested in buying wholesale from US to Europe when prices go down. And prices will go down, I&#039;m sure. You guys just have to remember what you are paying for your pack of cigarettes - and those are heavily taxed. Without taxes, a pack of cigarettes would be dirt cheap, next to nothing in fact. Compare this to weed, which is also just a plant, like wheat, barley, or any other field crop. Legal weed will grow on fields, not indoors with hydroponic setups and artificial light. This all depends on if the feds will bust legal field grows, though, since they are by nature quite impossible to hide. If marijuana is allowed to be grown outdoors in Colorado and Washington, the entire process from seed to bud will be automatic, you don&#039;t have to rent a trimmer because the trimmer will be a machine. And you will harvest with a tractor just like you do tobacco, and therefore the prices are going to resemble that, hence the $3 a pound, untaxed. Now, I doubt it&#039;s going to be allowed to be that cheap, I can see how that would get out of hand quickly, when a single dose of cannabis would cost less than a penny. Either way, I&#039;m betting my money on that weed is going to be cheaper than it is anywhere else in the entire world, and I hope to be able to be a part of that business here on SR, and resale it in my country in Europe.<br /><br />If someone here on SR decides to start up an international business from Colorado or Washington, I hope you will decide to make hashish, because it is easier to transport by mail. I would feel more comfortable ordering large amounts of hashish rather than weed, and I&#039;m sure quite a lot of people are going to agree on that. I sincerely believe Colorado and Washington are going to be exporting the best hashish the world has to offer for price/value! Good news!

				Long time grower here, new to SR. I think you will see the average outdoor green become less expensive, but quality indoor medical will stay high. I don&#039;t think people truly understand what it takes to grow indoors and keep a true medicinal grade product. $$$<br /><br />I look at it like steak. Anyone can cook a steak, but to get a high quality, aged to perfection, prime piece of meat cooked perfectly will cost you. <br /><br />I also believe in Co. and Wa. demand is going to go through the roof, we&#039;ll see if supply can keep up.

				Prices won&#039;t go down. Their whole pitch for getting it legalized was that it should be treated the same as Alcohol. You have any idea how much alcohol is taxed?

				You know a ton of illegal marijuana being shipped around is coming from Colorado, but dominantly most of it is coming from California.&nbsp; <br /><br />California bases its prices on quality and because of that the quality has gone up and the price has stayed constant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best chance is you get the same price for the same CALI weed <br />and maybe Colorado weed goes down a bit(but it&#039;s already been basically legal there)<br />and you won&#039;t see any effect from Washington b/c you never buy Washington weed anyway.

				Unless the federal laws change and/or all lower 48 adapt similar then its going to cause more problems than people think. The feds will be waiting to pounce on the people who would be stupid enough to try and ship from those 2 states to another state where its illegal. That alone turns it into federal turf and you can bet til all of the old close minded government types die out this will be fought tooth and nail. With the right to now grow openly people gonna try and steal whatever they can. Its a start and I think eventually it will be commonplace but it is still a ways off. It has been illegal far to long and already you got people foaming at the mouth to cash in which will create more problems. It is good to finally see some forward steps though.

My information might be off, but I&#039;ve heard it isn&#039;t a federal problem until the growing hits 100 or more plants. So to make a bigger profit, just grow a bigger plant. And I understand that the DEA are a pack of cunts, don&#039;t worry. ;)<br /><br />But mostly, I think that people will complain harder and harder. Because the war on drugs isn&#039;t in their hands, anymore. This stuff is legalized at the state level. It will be sold at the state level. And it will be illegal at the federal level. They&#039;ll have to arrest government officials just as much as the regular Joe on the street. It&#039;s no longer just the war on drugs... It&#039;s the civil-war on drugs. (Not to be confused with WKUK&#039;s Civil War On Drugs)<br /><br />The government now has to fight itself... and the people are not on its side. So, a whole battery of reasons why I think this will affect prices.

				I agree that the citizens of this country are more and more in support of legalizing Weed. But this is a battle that has been going on for 30+ years. There were people in the 1960&#039;s who believed that Weed would be legal by the year 2000... but here we are in 2012 and this issue didn&#039;t really make it to the forefront of discussion and debate up until the last 5 years. There is no predicting what will happen in the next 12 months as far as growing, selling, and enforcement goes. It will be very interesting to watch.<br /><br />Eventually, there will have to be a change in federal law. I think someday Weed will be legal, regulated, grown industrially, and sold in grocery stores. But given the rate of change over the last 30 years I would imagine that won&#039;t happen for another 5-15 years, maybe even longer.

Federal law covers the entire country, and federal law has the final word in any legal issues. States are allowed to pass their own laws and enforce them as well. The idea is; whatever the people in that state want, the people get. If you don&#039;t like the laws in one state, you can move to another. Every state has different laws on a variety of issues, ranging from: taxes, gun ownership, abortion, age for sexual consent, drugs, marriage, etc. <br /><br />One thing remains constant though; federal law. States may have different income taxes and sales taxes, but you must always pay the federal government (the IRS) a certain amount of taxes based on your income, no matter what. How this happens is that voters are able to put propositions on the ballot every voting cycle if they are able to collect enough signatures supporting the proposition. So in 1996 California became the first state to pass a law allowing Marijuana possession, cultivation, and use for medicinal purposes with the passing of Proposition 215. Marijuana is a controlled substance according to Federal law, and it is still illegal to use, possess, cultivate, or sell. <br /><br />When Prop215 passed, that mean state authorities would no longer prosecute anyone using medical marijuana within the scope of the law. There are rules on possession, cultivation, use (you can&#039;t share with people, you can&#039;t drive while high, etc). At first it wasn&#039;t a big deal and for about 5-10 years it was a pretty legitimate part of California&#039;s culture. What happened in the mid-2000s however was that some clever people figured out that they could put doctors on a payroll to write prescriptions for just about anybody who wanted one. Dispensaries were originally formed as a safe place to buy marijuana. All you needed was a prescription, and you could enter, choose from a selection, etc. Dispensaries were required to operate as non-profit businesses, since the goal was to provide medicine, not make money. <br /><br />Well, around the same time anybody could get a prescription for marijuana, dispensaries started popping up all over the state. Non-profit is actually a tax filing status but that doesn&#039;t mean &quot;you work for no money&quot;. Dispensary owners gave themselves healthy salaries (six-figures), and used a variety of techniques to make a very nice profit while still operating under the &quot;non-profit&quot; flag. Over the last 5-7 years we have experienced an explosion in the abuse of the medical marijuana system in California. Anybody can get a prescription, which means anybody can grow, have weed in their possession, be high, etc. If you can find the episodes online, &quot;Weed Wars&quot; by the Discovery Channel gives you a small peak at the medical marijuana industry. <br /><br />As the abuse of the system grew, the federal government began interfering more and more. The DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency, a federal law enforcement agency) has raided hundreds of dispensaries and farmers up and down California. When Obama first came to office 4 years ago, the DEA issued a statement saying they would leave the medical marijuana industry in California alone...but that only last about a year. As it stands now, the medical marijuana industry is still thriving, and although it is technically legal, it&#039;s still a risky business to be in because if you get too big or become too well known, the DEA is liable to come raid you. <br /><br />Federal law trumps all and until the DEA changes it&#039;s position on Marijuana, it doesn&#039;t matter what laws states pass, the DEA can go in and arrest anyone selling or using marijuana.

The government will be taxing what i sell legally big time(25+%) That being said, i have been growing top shelf weed for 5+ years in small quantities due to how it has been illegal. At that time i would sell my weed at 220$ an ounce to friends small scale when i had crop outs of around 2lbs. <br /><br />&nbsp; Now that its legal to the state i will be able to produce a much larger quantity of bud at less cost to me due to the fact that i wont have to be extremely stealthy and pay for stealth equipment. Im guessing that once i get my grow house up and running i will be able to offer a number of strains of top shelf cannabis for a lower price than i used to. Im thinking lower than 200$ an ounce. Im not sure exactly how much i will be taxed but i just got a business license and am setting everything up. <br /><br />&nbsp; I think that selling on SR would become a huge possibility for me because i can be Annonymous instead of doing street deals outside my shop. But there is also the aspect of when and if i sell on SR i will be breaking the law by selling to states other than WA and CO. Ill have to think it over but i will keep you guys updated with the loop of how things are going here in Washington. Im extremely well connected in the marijuana community here and will know all of the details of how things work very soon as time progresses.

Seriously, everything you say on here is being monitored. The only reason drganja isn&#039;t going to get ass-raped in Fed-prison is because I&#039;m making this comment and drawing his attention to it(hopefully). That gives him a chance to change his horribly thought out plans and NOT reveal them on the forums where every law enforcement agency that gives a shit is looking for a bust, ANY bust, they can tout to the media.<br /><br />Seriously drganja, I&#039;d apologize for ruining your plans, but if you really went through with them after that... I&#039;d be guilty of letting you get ass-raped in Federal prison instead. I&#039;m doing you a favor, and the only thing you have to do is not use that name. And try not to fuck up again. Don&#039;t name your business. Not in public, not in private, not even to your best friend Joe who is also on the forums and that you&#039;re sending PMs to.<br /><br />SR isn&#039;t like fight club. Talk about fight club all you like, for what I care. But when you&#039;re in fight club? You ONLY talk about fight club.
