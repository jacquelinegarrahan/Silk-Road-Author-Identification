				The reason I am posting this is because I cant talk to people about SR. This angry tone is not directed at anyone on SR, but to the rest of society.<br /><br />So for the most part, fuck people who talk down on &quot;drug dealers.&quot; We are providing a service that is wanted, and making our own living without having to follow the structure of school and working for things we dont even care about in the first place. I do not steal or hurt anyone to make my money, I give people a good product for a good price that they ask for. For everyone who says &quot;get a real job&quot; or &quot;you&#039;re JUST selling drugs,&quot; I have this to say: Get a real job? You mean go to school, get in debt, study your ass off, then get an entry level job where you don&#039;t even use any of the things you studied so hard all through school? Or how about become a member of the government, where the majority salary is made from stealing and hurting people? And JUST selling drugs? I am risking more than any day worker. I am risking my freedom every day. Before SR I could have been considered a street pharmacist, I helped plenty of people study (adderall), or get to sleep (xanax) when they had trouble, for less than $10 a pill, without having to get health insurance, set a doctors appointment, etc., and fuckin&#039; party (cocaine). And yes, I lived more comfortably because of it. I didn&#039;t steal, I didn&#039;t shove it down peoples throats, I just provided.<br /><br />So to all the vendors out there, thank you. If you haven&#039;t done so today, take a moment to be proud. I wish I could go scream this to a bunch of people, and it&#039;s too bad I have to keep this a secret from everyone I know, but I am glad I can provide a service for all of you buyers, and an income for myself. And the keep the governments cotton pickin&#039; hands off of it (slavery pun intended). But, fuck yeah vendors, you have all taken the initiative to do something for yourself. I am a brand new vendor, and already so proud to be a part of the Road.<br /><br />Ok my rants over. KEEP IT UP EVERYONE!

				Wow, you have opened a LOT of new threads recently.<br /><br />I sort of agree though. There are certainly drug dealers who do set a bad example and add to the public stereotype of what a &quot;pusher/ dealer&quot; is all about. In my experience they are certainly more prevalent in some communities/ drugs than others.<br /><br />Not many stereotypical/ violent mescaline/ ayahusca dealers out there, lol.

				I think the problem is that many dealers ain&#039;t business minded. They just settle for what they can get and flip it to make money. Not enough care about quality over price. Problem is that too many kids get into it to make a quick few quid and override those who want to provide a quality product. I have just come over from the street and I&#039;ve seen enough of the people I sell to step on my stuff because their clients wont pay the price for a gram of untouched. They don&#039;t have a choice but it&#039;s still sad to watch.

				Well if it is.. or if it isn&#039;t one person with multiple accounts it doesn&#039;t really matter to me.<br /><br />This thing we do, it&#039;s hard work. It&#039;s dangerous. It&#039;s risky.

It&#039;s not just about risk and danger. Though the fact that you could get shot, robbed, stabbed etcetc is very real and the risk of jail time is also very real. It takes hard work. It takes being out there all the time, keeping up with prices, keeping up with demand, finding new ways to cut, making sure you only cut a certain amount. dealing with people that are trying to scam you and rip you off on both ends of the transaction.

None of this shit is easy on the street, I&#039;m not even a vendor here, and I can only imagine how hard that can be. But I&#039;m looking forward to it.

I completely quit selling on the streets, which is pretty much the only way you can get caught. I have had almost all of the other dealers in my area besides me go down, probably because of customers snitching. Here, if a customer got caught if they are asked where they got it, &quot;uhh i dont know, some fucking guy on the internet.&quot; But it is a LOT more work. dealing with shipping and shit. Since i started, the first half of my day is packaging and weighing, driving to get supplies etc. And you dont receive the money for usually about a week, where as before I could just chill on my couch and have people come over or go to their house, and the cash was immediately in my pocket.

				Cheapestcocaine you offer such a wonderful service, I pay homage to all the great drug dealers in the world they make this place a wonderful thing.&nbsp; I hate the vendors who treat their customers like shit and send them bunk drugs... Assholes. Even worse send them nothing.&nbsp; I appreciate your service and their should be a national drug dealer day for sure. A recognized holiday across the globe, at least across SR.&nbsp; Im coming to make a sample purchase from you soon so look out for me.&nbsp; I really cant wait to try your stuff.

Sellers of illegal drugs are given a horrendous reputation and treated extremely harshly buy the legal system. I do understand that things like heroin and even methamphetamine and cocaine can be very addictive, but so are alcohol and tobacco which are freely available. At the end of the day it all comes down to making choices in life. We should be allowed to choose to use drugs without legal implications. The Government has banned marijuana, MDMA, Amphetamines, LSD, cocaine, etc for no good reason. It will never make sense that I can go and get smashed on alcohol every night for my entire life and never have any legal problems over using it, but if I got caught with 1/8th weed, it would be a different story.<br /><br />I also sell drugs on the street (very limited now though - I concentrate on Silk Road) and on Silk Road. I am not a violent person, nor do I harm other people. Yet if I got caught selling weed, I would be looking at at least 2 years in prison. Wheras in Australia, if I held up a store at knifepoint and robbed the till, I would most likely get off on probation. How does this make sense? I recently heard of a Father who raped his daughter frequently for several years from when she was as young as 9 years old. He got off without a prison sentence. Just has to go to a rehabilitation centre for a few years. I cannot believe that a rapist would end up in a better legal position than somebody who sells a product which people willingly buy.<br /><br />The world is fucked. Doctors can give out xanax like it&#039;s candy. People have no idea how addictive it can be and that it can cause more damage than using marijuana regularly.

				Well, the first page escalated quiete quickly&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Nice OP, I agree on mostly everything except that school is a waste.&nbsp; I drug deal basically to receive a good education, live comfortably, and to make other people happy.&nbsp; School is definetly alot more valuable than any amount of money that I can be spending on random things that I think I want :/ I also don&#039;t want money to lose value to me mentally, because then I wouldn&#039;t be happy with anything.&nbsp; I also would feel like shit if I was cheating life and living it up while people that I care about are all working their asses to the bone just to get by... I basically can&#039;t keep drug money and feel good about it. Anyone else share this view?

Non stop grinding in a polite, direct, honest manner. nothing is personal. It&#039;s all about being smart, making money and staying free to enjoy it. Usually it&#039;s involved with steady repeat clients that are not &quot;loud&quot; and rarely has contact with end users. This is the person that has graduated from the street, or been smart enough and lucky enough to skip street level. I imagine a great deal of vendors here could fall into small time #5s.<br /><br />

				When drugs are legalized, everyone who dealt them and supplied them and allowed their trade is going to be a hero for risking their ass to bring people the products they wanted and deserved. Silk Road is basically like the Underground Railroad, the way I see it. And everyone talked shit on that when it was around...
