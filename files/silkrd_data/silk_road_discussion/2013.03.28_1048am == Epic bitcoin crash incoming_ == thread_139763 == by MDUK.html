				So, try as I might, I struggle to justify the fact that BTC/USD has doubled in 10 days. Given that the currency is produced at a rate of 3600BTC/day, there&#039;s an effective net inflow of ~$3.4 million per day implied just to keep the currency flat price-wise.<br />I can accept that some are shitting bricks over the Cyprus situation, but I still can&#039;t fathom how this can be anything other than a bubble. Things are starting to feel very June-2011 ;)

				Its rising really fast at the moment thats for sure, it will hit $100 in 24 hours or probably less. It&#039;s risen $10 in the last 24hrs.<br />Im not really that worried as i dont have much invested in it. It would be hard to ride this out if you thousands of dollars in BTC.

				I hope it does crash personally, have done my orders for a few weeks so when it drops I&#039;m going to buy a bunch of BTC and hold onto them until they recover. <br />I think mentally $100 is sort of a glass ceiling for a lot of people so we could see a lot of people selling when it gets there.

				I really hate to seem liked I&#039;m blinded by $$$&#039;s &amp; BTC&#039;s but I don&#039;t really think a hard crash is coming. A correction is bound to happen but I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve met that point yet. I know SR accounts for a lion&#039;s share of the BTC economy but there has been millions of venture capital pumped into other legit BTC businesses and payment processors in the past few months. Along with increased(positive) media attention and the release of new mining rigs BTC is definitely experiencing a boom. The best part about all this new money being pumped into BTC is that there is a greater general interest in not allowing a collapse. <br />The crash of 2011 was brought about mostly by flaws in security that were exploited. It&#039;s hard to invest money in something that&#039;s not secure. Those problems have since been addressed and while there are still weaknesses in the blockchain the network is stronger than ever. Much like any banking or investment system there will always be attacks and scams but the early days of BTC have taught some valuable lessons which were applied and I believe we are seeing the benefits now. Any investor can come to terms with losses incurred by shifts in price but to lose by theft or deception is not a risk any smart investor will take. The volatility of the market is enough of a risk, no need for extra variables. <br />As BTC exits it&#039;s dark age and enters the new era I see no reason why it can&#039;t compete with other commodities that investors currently favor. The advantages BTC holds over other fiat currencies and commodities is slowly being revealed to the masses. As long as there are more people willing to invest in and use BTC than there are coins in circulation the value will hold.&nbsp; I think many here had envisioned BTC reaching this price, just not yet.&nbsp; When something incredible comes along you typically only get one shot to play.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let this be the reason you are watching from the sidelines.&nbsp; Believe me, I&#039;m all in. If Dwolla wasn&#039;t DDoS&#039;d last night I&#039;d be trying to buy more right now ;)<br />

				I think there may be a bubble at $100, but if it doesn&#039;t cause an incredibly fast firesale, there will be plenty put back into the market and possibly more longevity-based BTC investments. The price might stay high, but at least it would be more stable.

				I like how the vast majority of times that people predict a crash they give absolutely no economic reason why it would occur.&nbsp; At least make references to basics like supply and demand before you start going Chicken Little on us.&nbsp; Increases in supply are limited while demand seems to be going up exponentially in the long run... you guys can do the math.

				We should have a big virtual party when bitcoin hits $100.<br /><br />BTW, this is probably not a bubble. The 2011 bubble happened because media reports created a boom of interest that quickly died. It can be quantified by the USD exchange trade volume:<br /><br />https://blockchain.info/charts/trade-volume?timespan=all<br /><br />The trade volume is much higher now, and has been for a longer sustained period of time, so you would expect the price to be higher. The important point is whether this interest in bitcoin will disappear, like it did last time (that would cause a crash as people cash out). I don&#039;t think it will. This is a different time and environment. A lot more legit businesses are accepting bitcoin and many more people believe in it as a &quot;real&quot; currency.<br />

				Bitcoin May Be the Global Economy&#039;s Last Safe Haven<br /><br />One of the oddest bits of news to emerge from the economic collapse of Cyprus is a corresponding rise in the value of Bitcoin, the Internet’s favorite, media-friendly, anarchist crypto-currency. In Spain, Google (GOOG) searches for “Bitcoin” and downloads of Bitcoin apps soared. The value of a Bitcoin went up to $78. Someone put out a press release promising a Bitcoin ATM in Cyprus. Far away, in Canada, a man said he’d sell his house for BTC5,362.<br /><br />Bitcoin was created in 2009 by a pseudonymous hacker who calls him or herself Satoshi Nakamoto (and who might be several people). It’s a form of virtual cash used to buy goods and services online. Even by Web standards, it’s a strange and supergeeky phenomenon. This is what happens when software and networks meet the concept of currency, when you take peer-to-peer networks and advanced cryptography and ask, “How can I make a new economy?” <br /><br />There are 10,952,975 Bitcoins in circulation. (With a digital currency you can be specific.) Bitcoin isn’t about to replace hard currency—with a market cap of $864 million, all of it is worth less than what Facebook (FB) paid for Instagram—but it’s bigger than anyone expected. And many people will tell you that the emergence of a virtual global money supply beyond the reach and control of any government is very real and that it’s time we take it seriously. As long as the Internet remains turned on, Bitcoin will be there—to its adherents, it’s the Platonic currency.<br /><br />A dollar bill has a serial number and travels from buyer to seller. A Bitcoin’s not so much a thing as an understanding, a balance in a decentralized general ledger, or “account log.” Bitcoins are created as the side effect of a great deal of meaningless computational work. That is, the computer could be working on protein-folding, or processing images, or doing something else with its time, but instead it’s being used to “mine” Bitcoins—searching for mathematical needles in a networked haystack. Once the needle is found, a “block” of Bitcoins is born. Bitcoins live in a bit of software known as your “wallet.”<br /><br />How did they get there? Perhaps you minted them by mining, or bought them on an exchange, or received them as part of a barter transaction. Now those Bitcoins are burning a bithole in your bitpocket, and you want to buy something. How do you spend them? Clicking around your wallet app, you set up a payment and put in the Bitcoin address of the recipient—something memorable and fun, like 1Ns17iag9jJgTHD1VXjvLCEnZuQ3rJDE9L. A few minutes later, after the peer-to-peer network has authorized the transaction as legitimate, the recipient’s wallet, wherever it is, will show that you’ve paid up. <br /><br />How is this different from PayPal (EBAY)? In theory anyone could run his own version of PayPal on a server and use that to transfer funds between parties. But he’d also need to handle world currencies, deal with security, and handle regulations. Similarly, physical banks promise protections above and beyond stuffing cash in a mattress or dropping it off in paper bags. Financial institutions commodify trust—it’s not their money, after all. It’s yours. Yet you trust them more than you trust yourself.<br /><br />Bitcoin shrugs all this off. It’s not pegged to anything, and there are no regulations. It’s a supercomputer-size chore to counterfeit. The key thing to understand is that there’s no bank, no Federal Reserve, in the middle. It’s not unlike an exchange-traded fund (for example, FORX, from Pimco)—a mix of non-U.S. currencies—designed as a hedge against the dollar. Bitcoin is a hedge against the entire global currency system. And no exchange is needed, unless you want to convert your Bitcoin into an actual hard currency.<br /><br /><br />clearnet link<br /><br />http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-28/bitcoin-may-be-the-global-economys-last-safe-haven#r=rss

This currency truly has the potential to empower the underclass.

My only concern is a fear that once the world governments begin to lose their economical power, Bitcoin will be attacked. How will this effect Bitcoin? Will they become outlawed?

				I would expect that when it hits $100,&nbsp; a number of programmed sales will occur, and the price will drop&nbsp; to the $70 range.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />However, there will also be people like me just waiting to buy some more at that&nbsp; price and the price should creep back up <br />over the following week. <br /><br />Bitcoins have more value than basic stocks because you can buy important things with them, and this will get more important in the future as<br />people start putting part of their savings in Bitcoins.&nbsp; In case of Natural Disaster&nbsp; or Bank problems, Bitcoins could be a lifesaver.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				And $102. Making it look easy.<br /><br />I saw a massive wall at $100 earlier. People see those and think, &quot;that many bitcoins have to be purchased to break through&quot;, but those walls are dynamic. Sell orders can be withdrawn. When people see the trade price approaching their sell price, they think, &quot;if there&#039;s that much buying interest, why sell these for $100 when I can sell them for $105?&quot;. Trade walls can melt away very fast, and indeed that one did.<br />

				It just breezed over the $100 mark with barely a sound. I really wonder where it will go from here. All you can do i guess is purchase what you need when you need it. I keep waiting for it to drop to buy some, but i think maybe the opportunity has passed by.

				There&#039;s an issue with the amount of activity on the Bitcoin network these days; it needs to be modified slightly to handle the volume it&#039;s getting now.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t pay a decent transaction fee, it can frequently take awhile.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had one take 24+ hours to get a single confirmation -- as long as the transaction is listed, even with 0 confirms, it&#039;ll happen eventually.&nbsp; Nothing to be done but wait really.

Every time the price goes down people decide &quot;oh shit I should sell and cut my loses&quot; so they sell to minimize loses. They sell at a lower price than everyone else and this drives the price down, then the next person does the same thing.

				If anything this ordeal just goes to show how emotional people are when it comes to $.<br /><br />For those of you, like me, who are mostly here to just get drugs: just overestimate the cost of your drugs by 10% when you go to buy your BTC and buy your drugs as soon as you have them in your SR account.&nbsp; There typically is very little risk of major fluctuations in that time period.&nbsp; Not to say that it doesn&#039;t happen, just that it doesn&#039;t happen that often.<br /><br />As far as I&#039;m concerned the fundamentals of this currency are still fine and it will probably be over $1000 / BTC by the end of the year.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be using my profits from selling MDMA to funnel into BTC, especially while it&#039;s low right now.&nbsp; If you think the market cap of BTC is never going to get past $3 billion then you are smoking some real good shit.&nbsp; BTC offers a way for people to avoid taxes, and that&#039;s an attribute that is rarely ever mentioned.

I&#039;ll be really surprised if this recently growth sustains itself. I&#039;m still expecting below $100 levels again, the latest rise just seems to be the classical bull trap. I&#039;m expecting a lot of this recent attention to fizzle out as April goes on, also fizzling down the price to something more reasonable like $60 even. I remember when $60 was insane and I was calling bubble so the current valuation still seems overpriced.
