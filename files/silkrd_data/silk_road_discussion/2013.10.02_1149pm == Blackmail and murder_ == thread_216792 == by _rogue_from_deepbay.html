				DPR got scammed<br /><br />whether it be by a friendly jurisdiction (for example, The Canadians) giving the Feds more ammunition, or by an enterprising person putting together a sting, we&#039;ll probably never know.<br /><br />The feds have no issue with putting both the motivation and the means in the hands of a target they really want to nail. Look at their terrorist cases. Here, lets drive you to the airport, we know a guy who can sell you a stinger too. Bang. got you.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216792.msg1584279#msg1584279">Quote from: Gangnam Style on October 03, 2013, 01:33 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think DPR got scammed too and he was too proud to be able to do anything about it, and the 80K &quot;hit&quot; was bullshit too. This guy saw he was desperate and knew if he was so desperate to get another SR user to do it that he picked him for the fool he was and got him for the full amount one way or another.<br /><br />The ironic thing is, he would have had to present evidence and what is funny is you could pay anyone to make someone look dead for a couple of hundred dollars including makeup costs. Both the scammer and the original DPR are laughing now while so many cry.<br /><br />The point I think we all need to learn here is that they have everything backdoored and only the most bold of vendors and buyers will continue on after this, we had sold out and had planned on giving up and it is ironic that SR went down just as we were taking a break for safety reasons. It makes the decision that much easier!<br /><br />We are glad we vended even if it was for a couple of months so we can say what we can all say and that is we were a part of something historical no doubt about it. We can say we were a part of history and contributed something to benefit others lives however meager our efforts were in the overall scheme of things. We were happy to make our fake weed customers and pain sufferers lives that little bit brighter, although I never understood why people liked the fake weed it wasn&#039;t our thing and we just gave it away. <br /><br />All good things must end, but where to now? What&#039;s next?<br /><br />Do we all get off here, say goodbye and retreat back into the netherworld from whence we came? Or do we rise up, and seize the challenges that lay ahead of us and capitalizing on our freedoms we were inherently born with and we show that the Universe belongs to all of us and that includes cyberspace, and we regroup elsewhere and wait out the storm coming back to fight another day for our freedoms?<br /><br />Sadly for us we have decided for the foreseeable future not to get anymore synthetic cannabis or pain killers so our store is closed but anyone who is still willing to vend to people should be careful where you next call home. We all thought DPR was on top of things but it turns out he was just a young cypherpunk without any common sense. <br /><br />It has been an honor serving with you all ladies and gentlemen, we will never forget Silk Road and DPR&#039;s image one day will become as famous as Che Guevara. <br /><br />The most important thing for everyone to remember, this DPR is not the original DPR and it is that DPR who&#039;s memory we should honor, fuck Ross he was a stupid arrogant cunt of a man who although a genius was also a murderous treacherous creature who clearly cared more about Ross than Silk Road. <br /><br />It shames me to know he was running this out of an apartment in San Fransisco using public WiFi and probably not even using anything other than TOR to mask his location. I am sure many of us all thought his servers were in a nuclear missile silo or something crazy like that hiding us from all comers, and although the FBI did say that he had his servers overseas they wouldn&#039;t say where they were located which is also strange.<br /><br />We await what will be the trial of the century now and if DPR really can&#039;t afford anything better than a public service defender, aka shill lawyer for the government, we should all try and find a way to maybe pool some Bitcoin those of us who can afford it and send it to someone either in his family or publicly hire lawyers willing to take the case for both it&#039;s money as well as fame, and see Silk Road&#039;s community come to our captains side. I figure it is the least we could do considering the joy he brought to our lives that has been paid for with his, like a martyr almost.<br /><br />Nah fuck that, if it was old DPR for sure we all would but this Ross guy was stupid with a million users lives he decided to hang around Silicon Valley tech heads who probably figured out who he was just from his ridiculous cover business and Bitcoin based tech wealth! I would bet that other person in the interview with him where they host the most strange podcast ever was the person called inigo. I would almost bet my life on it as a matter of fact. <br /><br />We thought DPR was older and more wise than this Ross fellow and had many of us known exactly who DPR was I highly doubt Silk Road would have been more successful than Atlantis. Now all the Atlantis bashers are eating their words because if we had embraced Atlantis for the excellent site many thought it was, it would most assuredly still be here today.<br /><br />Come back Atlantis the world needs you and now is your time!<br /><br />This is just so far beyond amazing and for all the wrong reasons that anyone would think I was on drugs, however this is all musing to you out there in Onionland with some small assistance from coffee and nicotine. <br /><br />I am going to work now at my taxation thieving office job and remember the joy SR brought to all our lives.<br /><br />Everyone have a great day, all except for the bastards working for LE... yeah you... punk ass bitches.<br /><br />&#039;Murica... fucking the world up one hour at a time and enforcing their will on others... congratulations!<br /><br />Much love to you all this will be our last post from here on out we are spectators again wearing civilian clothing instead of battle khaki&#039;s of revolution, it is a huge counter-punch to liberation and the destruction of something that brought people together from all over the world.<br /><br />May you all find peace in your lives and we love you... fuck the governments we want to trade not kill each other, spreading ideas and sciences and wealth in the process. <br /><br />Trade brings joy and governments destroy that basic human right to freedom of body as well as trade!<br /><br />Goodnight Silk Road from all of us at Gangnam Style stay safe out there wherever you are in the world that grows smaller by the day it is us who have time on our side, DPR more so than others, and one day like Mandela he will walk the Earth again with us free and proud.<br /><br />Until then it is a teary goodbye :&#039;( <br /><br />~ PSY 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>you may want to add OD rate is probably gonna go up as all of those rc&#039;s being sold as acid are gonna be more on the street now.

				&quot;where he enlisted one Silk Road user to murder another Silk Road user who was threatening to release the identities of all of the website’s users.&quot;<br /><br />Lol what a load of shit. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s real easy to get a nerdy Online drug dealer to go kill a guy for you real quick.<br /><br />&quot; who was threatening to release the identities of all of the website’s users&quot;<br /><br />We all know damn well our identities aren&#039;t kept on SR
