				Lately a lot of ppl fire theire orders into the resolution center before even contacting me. Shipment to the usa can take 2-4 weeks.... Due to this i stopped selling to the usa. Most of the orders who get to the resolution center are recieved fine a few days after putting it into resolution center.<br /><br /><br />Show some freaking respect and contact your seller first before making demands!

				Agreed. Finalize on inspection of delivery, not after you sampled the product.

				Modify your rating after you&#039;ve sampled-vender is happy and you are still empowered as a consumer, yes you lose out on resolution should you be disappointed in product but hopefully if your schooled your dealing with reputable vendor who will make it right no matter what.

As was said you can not only modify rating to reflect sellers score but you can also modify your comments at any time. If you&#039;re unhappy with quality you may reflect that by speaking with seller. If a resolution cannot be made inform others by changing your comments and learn from your transactions of which sellers are reputable and which products you like.

If they immediately cry scam then I can see your point but buyers do have to protect themselves and that can only be done in escrow which can be extended when orders take longer to arrive.

				Every single vendor until this one has made me early finalize (because i&#039;m Canadian and have no choice if I want the product) but then I fuck up huge.&nbsp; I totally forgot to finalize until 4 or 5 days after I received the package, and feel like absolute shit lol.&nbsp; Vendors, stop making me early finalize EVERYTHING!!! Then I won&#039;t forget to finalize when the escrow system is actually being used correctly.&nbsp; Nah the onus is on me for having a poor memory and vendor who nkows who he is i&#039;m sorry (but for real would EVERY vendor stop making me early finalize, I would like to use the escrow system one day and have 25 purchases lol).
