				Keep calm people, there&#039;s enough paranoia to go around for everyone ;)<br /><br />FYI: I&#039;m not commenting on the situation as I only just read about what&#039;s been happening, but if there&#039;s one thing that happens regularly and rapidly is people/venues/whatever being suspected of being LE.

				What&#039;s far more likely is that Atlantis is simply a rival site and they/their associates were involved in the DDoS.<br /><br />We have no evidence of this, but it does seem rather suspicious that just as SR goes offline, people start posting about this wonderful new site Atlantis, and how its so much better than the road. <br /><br />Now that&#039;s fine, but the way in which these people were talking about it sounded fanatical.

				It has nothing to do with the recent DDoS attacks but I personally wouldn&#039;t recommend using Atlantis at all just because one vendor who got recently banned on SR and also screwed up my stats and bunch of other people stats for not sending anything, went over there.<br /><br />Total transactions: 26<br />Total spent: $14142.36<br />Refund rate: 0.23%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 2 months<br /><br />That is all..

				To add some real life perspective into the theory that Atlantis is LEO...There was a DEA operation in the 1980&#039;s in Miami, where they had agents pose as money laundering service. The DEA allowed the case to go on for over a year, as once their company had their name out they had people lining up for their services. All the undercover agents had to do was to gain the trust of a few key players and the rest followed.This action was accomplished by allowing a few transfers to to precede while&nbsp; tracing everything along the way. The sting was instituted because of the local PD&#039;s inability to bust the cocaine traffickers who were running wild combined with Regan&#039;s just say no bullshit. Google around I cannot honestly think of the case now. I will have to check my library. The tactic of the police setting up some type of honeypot sting is not unprecedented. There was also another more recent case in LasVegas, where the local PD again posed as money launderers/drug dealers. So could it truly be illogical or the police to set up a fake service to entrap the vendors for which they cannot trace on the SR? I mean come on this service is the bane of existence of every law enforcement organization on the planet. It would not surprise me if Atlantis was some type of international partnership to bring down vendors......Just food for thought for everyone to ruminate on.

Half the posts on this forum are speculation, and accusations with no proof.<br /><br />This is a discussion forum, not the Supreme Court, and what I brought up is plausible and timely and discussion on the issue is worthy (reminder: this is just a forum).

				I think we&#039;re all forgetting what is really important here. It&#039;s not the DDOS attacks, it&#039;s not SR&#039;s security, it&#039;s not the state of the world economy, it&#039;s not that you can get persecuted for putting powder up your noes and it&#039;s not the mass inequality that some of you socialist fucks want to get rid of even though it makes the world go round. <br /><br />What matters, is that I just checked to see if the shops were open so I could go and get cigarettes and orange juice and so is Burger King so I can go and get something I don&#039;t have to cook. So fuck you guys, I&#039;m off to the shops. <br /><br />And I suggest you all think of the ulterior meaning in these words very carefully because there is no ulterior meaning at all.....
