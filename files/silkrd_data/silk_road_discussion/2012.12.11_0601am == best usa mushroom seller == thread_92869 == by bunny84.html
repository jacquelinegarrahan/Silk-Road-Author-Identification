				I just ordered from mushroomgirl after reading alot of great reviews on potency and stealth packaging.&nbsp; So far she has had good communication and I should be receiving them this week.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let everyone know how they are when they arrive!<br /><br />Update:&nbsp; Package arrived&nbsp; in three days with incredible stealth and all the shrooms were intact and dried perfectly.&nbsp; Me and some buddies decided we needed to try them out Saturday night and man was that a great decision!&nbsp; Shrooms were top notch and an eighth gave me an awesome tip lasting about 4 - 5 hours

				I believe Rocker offers Texas strain, although Penis Envy is a great strain as well but it&#039;s a bit over-hyped.&nbsp; Can&#039;t go wrong with any really, just look out for bunk sellers via reviews and here on the forums...bout the best you can do.

				MushBox! In my opinion, he&#039;s simp[ly the best. Very professional, VERY quick to respond to your messages, VERY secure all around, and his packages always get to me in 2-3 days. I&#039;ve had 2 transactions with him and both were flawless. I took 2g&#039;s of his Penis Envy strain over the summer and I was GONEEE&nbsp; ::) :o. I usually need 3.5g&#039;s to get a good trip in but I was WELL off with 2g&#039;s of his stuff. I will def vouch for MushBox, all the way!
