				personally, i wouldnt do it.<br /><br />escrow protects the seller and buyer,<br /><br />&nbsp;in the event it never arrives, you cannot resolve it if youve already paid him, and then he keeps the money, and maybe even the product.<br /><br />3 reviews isnt enough in my opinion. i think you know in your gut its not worth it

				no way <br />If you want to use escrow, do it right. <br />You could finalize with a 1/5 and tell them you will change it when it arrives**.<br />I bet that would get you some pretty fast shipping.<br /><br />**(This is bad idea and a joke)

				Scam, for sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can see if the guy told you from the gitgo he didn&#039;t fuck with escrow and to take it or leave it but comeon the dude got a sellers account, went through the trouble of funding his coinage and understood how escrow works and now he&#039;s worried about getting ripped off?&nbsp; &nbsp;He isn&#039;t he just wants to rip you.<br /><br />Anyonw that was THAT worried about getting scammed would never sell on SR in the first place.&nbsp; A brand new buyer can easily scam multiple sellers if I understand the system correctly.&nbsp; They understand the risk upfront.<br /><br />Just as a new vendor trying to prove himself while offering send first to vets on the other forums.&nbsp; How would it sound once the first person said &quot;ok I&#039;ll let you prove yourself&quot; if he suddenly needed money up front.<br /><br /><br />Post his name up here so he can at least answer back and defend himself and so we can question him.<br /><br />Just think of it this way, if you were a legit dealer/vendor and you made the decision to take a chance and sell on SR through escrow, would YOU go back on your word?&nbsp; Ofc you wouldn&#039;t , don&#039;t be fooled by the majority of shady dealers who are liars and promise makers, the type of dealer you need is one that has excelled in game and is here after learning the ropes.&nbsp; <br /><br />A dealer like that will either see SR as a way he is willing to do business or a way he is not.&nbsp; He will be able to determine this pretty quickly.&nbsp; &nbsp; Does this guys actions sound like that type of vendor?<br /><br />I think inside you know how this will end for you if you go outside of escrow.&nbsp; Fuck sending the money with a 1/5 review.&nbsp; A piece of shit scamming junky will take anything.&nbsp; &nbsp; Even if he can only make 20 before being exposed he will.&nbsp; What if you are the only one dumb enough to do this and he realized most wont fall for it but at least he can now go cop a 20 rock or a blue.<br />

				I will never release escrow with someone I&#039;m doing business with for the first time until I get my product.<br /><br />I have been known to release escrow after a package arrives, especially if I don&#039;t plan on testing for a while and if the seller has previous positive quality feedback.<br /><br />Otherwise, use what SR offers.&nbsp; Escrow is there for a reason.<br /><br />- Bit

				No way!<br /><br />Make a few smaller transactions with the seller, and decide if you think they&#039;re trustworthy. You&#039;ll know then if it feels right or not.

				First of all &quot;performance&quot; you didn&#039;t see that in my post I said two per customer when you decided to buy out my entire stock. Two, I did not ask the three SR members who left feedback to finalize before shipping. Three... I did get scammed for transactions I made out side of &quot;SR&nbsp; escrow&quot; and I accept all my losses. Four, I&#039;m not a scammer! If you want to buy out my entire stock then you have to pay up front as with any deal on the streets. Sorry but that&#039;s just how I do it if you plan on buying out my entire stock, I much rather spread my products through several people instead of just one who may potentially re post what he/she bought from me and re-sell at an inflated price. And last but not least I was very up front with you and told you everything you wanted to know and I really don&#039;t appreciate you posting my vendor name anywhere unless I truly ripped you off which I did not. Anyway WHATEVER! If I truly did mean harm upon you or tried to rip you off you&#039;d be one worried SR member right now because you didn&#039;t bother to PM me before purchasing and decided to send your &quot;sensitive information&quot; to someone you though could be a scammer which worked out for you because I&#039;m not a crook and did not release your information to someone who could do you harm... Water under the bridge. :) peace SR!

That last line right there would be knife in the chest of any seller in and of itself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> ok, let&#039;s clear some things out. I don&#039;t have any listings up because I ran out. The people who bought from me know who they are and left the feedback themselves after they received their products and never not once did I tell them what to put down as you&#039;re looking at exclamation points. And about his information it was gone as soon as I clicked cancel. I never wrote it down or copied and pasted it anywhere. I was just simply saying that if I meant to do him harm I very easily could of before canceling because he didn&#039;t take the time to get to know the vendor who he later thought was a scam. Last but not least I think I have the right to ask someone for money up front if they plan on buying out my entire stock. Like I said before, I was up front with him and always told him what he wanted to know I even asked him if he had any ideas on how we could make it work, he didn&#039;t have any input so I left it there. If I could go and ask the people who&#039;ve purchased from me to confirm that I&#039;m not scaming people I would but I delete all messages as soon as they&#039;re read and sent and I don&#039;t keep tabs on who I&#039;ve sold to. If they want to come on here and say so for them selves they are welcomed to.

				You&#039;d have the right to ask for money upfront if you were on the streets, but this goes blatantly goes against the rules very clearly spelled out in the rules: &quot;NOTICE: Do not create listings that instruct customers to pay outside of escrow. &quot; <br /><br />Some sellers do it, but only very well-established ones and even for them it&#039;s not cool according to some. Maybe you&#039;re trying to do things right, but you just seem to be skipping steps that we&#039;ve all went though. To be a successful seller it takes time...nothing but that will vouch you.
