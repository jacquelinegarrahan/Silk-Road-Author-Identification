				Read for yourself guys... and stay safe:<br /><br />http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1508217/jail-time-for-web-drug-trafficker/?cs=2452<br /><br />A man has become the first Illawarra person - and one of only a handful nationwide - to be convicted of trafficking drugs via an underground website.<br /><br />Christopher Owen was yesterday jailed for a minimum 5½ years for selling large amounts of drugs via the Silk Road - an anonymous, online drug-trading website in which buyers pay for illegal substances using the Bitcoin virtual currency.<br /><br />Wollongong District Court was told by the prosecution that Owen ran a &quot;reasonably sophisticated&quot; drug operation out of two rooms in his parents&#039; Figtree home, shipping MDMA (ecstasy), the horse tranquiliser ketamine and methylamphetamine to customers across the country.<br /><br />Police documents tendered to the court said police found various amounts of drugs organised in Australia Post envelopes when Owen was pulled over and his car searched in West Wollongong on April 27 last year.<br /><br />The envelopes were addressed to different people across the country. Police also found more than $1000 cash and two mobile phones linked to Owen&#039;s drug deals in the car.<br /><br />However, the full extent of the drug operation was not known until officers searched Owen&#039;s recently renovated bedroom.<br /><br />Inside, they found a &quot;mini office&quot; with computers, a safe, drugs, scales, cutting agents, about $14,000 in cash and a drug ledger with a record of transactions.<br /><br />An examination of Owen&#039;s mobile phone revealed a user name and password for the Silk Road website, of which he was an active member for about two months.<br /><br />An entry on the site spruiking Owen&#039;s wares promised &quot;high quality crystal meth and high end MDMA&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;My goal is a happy customer, unlike most (not all) meth dealers you meet face to face,&quot; Owen wrote in an April 18, 2012, entry on the site.<br /><br />The court heard records from the website showed Owen supplied 172 MDMA pills in 28 separate transactions from April 16 to April 26 last year, as well as shipping three packages of unknown drugs in separate transactions during the same period.<br /><br />In return, he received 1689.49 &quot;Bitcoin&quot; - the equivalent of $8447.45.<br /><br />The court heard that Owen became hooked on ice when he was 20 but managed to keep his addiction and drug operation a secret from his parents.<br />See your ad here<br /><br />Judge Paul Conlon yesterday accepted that Owen had no prior criminal convictions, had good prospects of rehabilitation and had entered guilty pleas at the earliest opportunity, entitling him to a 25 per cent discount on his final sentence.<br /><br />He ordered Owen to spend a minimum of 5½ years in jail with a further five years on parole.<br /><br />With time already served, Owen will be eligible for parole on October 26, 2017.

So how difficult is it to think this dumb ass did a BUNCH more that was even more STUPID than what is mentioned here. They never, ever tell the true story to the public. The more they can put unsettling thoughts in people&#039;s head the more POWER they gain. Come on think for a minute. Do they really want us to know that this was more than a traffic stop. No, hell no. That would give up far to much information on their operations.<br /><br />Use some common sense and read carefully before you post such stupid comments.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Peace and Love....&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Keep smiling<br />

				One thing, and the MOST IMPORTANT thing is he DID NOT GET BUSTED BECAUSE OF SILK ROAD!<br /><br />Nor did he just get randomly pulled over and searched.<br /><br />CLEARLY he had been drug dealing for some time.<br /><br />Still sucks for him.

				whether he was being targeted before this traffic stop, we don&#039;t know.&nbsp; What&#039;s scary is this, he was keeping a ledger and he had his SR user/pass right out in the open in his phone.&nbsp; Which means LE could login as him, see all his history which they can match up to his ledger to gain a bigger picture.&nbsp; They can take over his account and do all sorts of nefarious shit.<br /><br />As far as who it was, could be one of those times where a trusted vendor had all the sudden stopped shipping and messaging for a length of time.&nbsp; When LE takes&nbsp; it over, depending on what they want to do with it, could easily make up some excuse for why they stopped shipping and answering messages.&nbsp; Then from there, who knows what they do.<br /><br />The scary part is.... how many other vendors here keep ledgers of any kind, whether it be some spreadsheet on their PC or some paper copy they have laying around.&nbsp; How many keep our addresses in some shape or form, for whatever reason.... to keep a list of their customers, to have addresses to help pinpoint customers who might be trying to scam them.&nbsp; <br /><br />We know there are going to be security conscious vendors who do everything to protect themselves and their customers, and there&#039;s going to be vendors that try and be safe but are lax in certain areas and then we got vendors who probably don&#039;t give a shit or vendors who aren&#039;t very computer literate and therefore everything is out there in the open.<br /><br />We just saw from the vendor that got hacked.&nbsp; He fell for a easy to spot fake message, then fell for clicking on some random site that got him to give up his PIN number.&nbsp; The message didn&#039;t even pass a PGP signature verification.&nbsp; We see all those vendors who say &quot;ahh, pgp if you have to, but not necessary&quot;<br /><br />One should not only be researching vendors who ship out as advertised product, who have good communication, who have good stealth, but also ones that you trust are probably not saving your personal info in any way.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been in IT for over 2 decades and I have seen it all, when it comes to what people do on their PC&#039;s.&nbsp; What they save, where they save it and how stealthy they actually are.&nbsp; You would be amazed at the amount of personal info that people save and how easy they make to find it or be able to access it.

				If the report is accurate (and it can also not be) then I wonder how can one be so stupid.<br /><br />Ledger? C&#039;mon! Password + user account in a phone? Oh my... how can one be so imbecile? (if you need to store the pass somewhere at the very least don&#039;t tie to it the username, ffs!)<br />Drugs and cutting agents in the place where he lives? C&#039;mon!<br /><br />Now the problem is that LE (again if the report is true) can have all the addresses of the buyers (given the stupidity of the guy I would not bet either a cent that he hasn&#039;t kept all the info of the people he made transactions with) and they have an established vendor account to get even more until we cannot establish who the person was here in the SR.<br /><br />I cannot believe that people can be so idiot, really, especially if you are a vendor.

				Woollongong is a few hours drive south of Sydney Oz, and is almost be described as&nbsp; &quot;a big country town&quot; . . . any 20yo kid with a bit of cash and a flash car, and no visible income becomes a target for local cops, who target the local kids anyway ... but, this kid was probably driving a bit fast and got pulled, and in Oz, when they stop you, they dont really need a &#039;reason&#039; to search you,<br />just a &quot;suspicion&quot; you &quot;might have&quot; drugs or weapons in the vehicle.&nbsp; <br /><br />In Oz,&nbsp; &nbsp;a traffic stop id one of the common methods cops bust people down here, shit, been done 3 times myself from trafffic stops and subsequent searches!&nbsp; &nbsp;So they pulled this kid, and the contraband they found in the car, gave them a reason to search his house...his parent&#039;s house where this &quot;20 and bulletproof&quot; kid felt completely secure . . . who knows what his parents did, but he might/must have &quot;thought&quot; the cops would never raid them...and maybe he was right, that is UNTIL the cops pull him over with tons of fuckin evidence! Fuck Me!&nbsp; this is kinda scary for his customers sake!<br /><br />&nbsp;As many have commented&nbsp; pool playa in particular, I have to agree, it&nbsp; IS truly scary, <br />&nbsp; BUT, fortunately we can fairly safely assume the &quot;weak link in the chain&quot; here, was the kid, and his driving/car, and the high possibility his new found wealth was being flaunted and he had made someone angry/jealous in this relatively small town (IIRC &lt;50,000peeps) and IMO&nbsp; Woolongong is infamous for it&#039;s traffic cops, coz the main highway to/from Melbourne goes straight through it, and they are fuckin everywhere in their hot as highway pursuit vehicles ...&nbsp; <br /><br />As for what they &quot;found&quot; at his home.....faaaarkin hell!&nbsp; Just faark!&nbsp; I REALLY hope I dont know/do biz with any vendors like this!&nbsp; &nbsp;wow...just WOW!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;man I drive at fuckin EXACTLY the speed limit&nbsp; for 15-20kms either side of any of these &quot;regional cities&quot; in Oz coz trhe coppers are just rabid,...and yes motek had had about 5 too many traffic tickets going through Woolongong! and dozens from regional zones within 20kms of one of these big towns/small cities<br /><br />And Woolongong is a Cunt of a place really, 20 odd years ago it was a dark dirty town that kinda weirded me out, now they&#039;ve tarted the place up and it&#039;s become more touristy .... fucked if I can figure why anyone would WANT to go to there, except when passing through, like about 50,000 cars a day do... lots of bored kids, and no doubt pissed off tweaskers also!<br />

				Lots of things I&#039;m sure vendors here don&#039;t think about. If you taking a phone, especially an iPhone with you when doing your drops, turn it off unless you want LE to have a mapped out log of where you have been.&nbsp; Don&#039;t keep anything incriminating on it, a simple wipe or delete still allows for data to be retrieved from your phone.

				Any vendor running a decent sized OP probably has people working for him, for example, we make our product in 1 state, we ship it from another, and our customer service department/owner lives in a different state. The email accounts that are used to communicate between the company is a very expensive email account that is secure, all messages we send use 4096 bit RSA asymmetric key encryption and the account can be deleted with a click of a bottom with nothing stored after the account is deleted. The FED&#039;s would have to show up at the of shore hosting provider with warrants in hand then they would have to try to retrieve data that has been deleted from the server and if they manage to get this far they would have to be able to break the encryption before even reading a message. This being said there are ways to communicate with out leaving yourself open to become a victim to LE. Before anyone does anything they should always plan far enough ahead where these types of problems never occur.

Yeah he was silly, made lots of mistakes and ultimately has no one else to blame but himself however....<br /><br />Its not funny that he will be, more than likely, physically and emotionally abused in prison. What hope does he really have now? He will come out of the place as a better brand of criminal and will more than likely be recruited into an OMC and &#039;groomed&#039; into a violent and angry person. He did have a fairly good operation going by the sounds of it and with the right guidance he could have been very successful and for a very long time too. <br /><br />He obviously has the skills required to run a business, he is internet/tech savvy (granted lazy and arrogant with the safety stuff but still..), must have been good with customers and suppliers alike and sounded like an &#039;organized&#039; person with regards to the &#039;order assembly line&#039; sounding like a real system and not just shoot from the hip stuff...<br /><br />Society has let this person down by our laws on illicit drugs and the fact that if they had been different this young entrepreneur may have walked a very different path.. After all had he either not become addicted to gear in the first place or hadn&#039;t had to face the realization that to support his habit at the prices here in Au he was going to need to be earning a fuckit load of cash... No surprise he he went the way he did given the high profit and the access to better stuff this all gets you..<br /><br />I know of serious violent criminals, assaults, rapes, kiddie fiddling etc etc, that haven&#039;t gotten the length of time this fucker got! its pathetic that they actually consider this a worse crime and him a greater danger to the community that the countless POS that get good behavior or suspended sentences or 12 -18 month and parole after 60% served... The thing about jail/prison is that the first time its not the length so much as the going in .. Once you have that on you your life options are limited and it will never go away.. People go in and as soon as 3 months later (if they are lucky to have such a short visit) they come out different and never in a good way.. <br /><br />Fucking sad day. I for one will be taking a day to review my security as a way of marking and remembering... <br /><br />I want to organize a a secret flash mob that would have to be a big one but basically protesting (by civil disobedience) the fucked up laws here. Idea is EVERY smoker and sympathetic to the cause flash mob a police station and light up a fat blunt... Well some will have real stuff others it would be fake but through over whelming numbers and some creative looking fakes we could both make a statement of solidarity and make the prospect of arresting and charging anyone almost impossible.. Lab tests aren&#039;t cheap and finding 6 real joints in a crowd of tens of thousands.. not to mention then convicting them... <br /><br />The police are going to be happier and more fulfilled people when they don&#039;t have to over look the fact they are making no difference in the community and arguably making it a worse situation.. Too much pressure to get the &quot;druggies&#039; and so the real crimes and the community improvement that they could be doing is missed.

				Country is irrelevant, drug busts happen all over the world. Their has been several Silk Road related in the USA lately and a big one in Germany just recently. This guy was just unlucky that he got pulled over and at the time was doing a mail drop. The only reason it made the news was because they could link it back to Silk Road because of lax security. I read a lot of posts here were I am sure a lot of users here have their head buried in the sand and because they and have no real life drug experience and are using the postal system to either sell or get drugs they think they are untouchable.

				The bust in Germany wasn&#039;t SR related as far as I know. The pictures of his packages in the article didn&#039;t look SR-like at all, they were all extremely suspicious.

The amount of nanny laws that already exist and ones that are in planning or currently going through parliament is crazy.<br />Apparently they are there to protect us. I don&#039;t see the need for ISP&#039;s to retain data for TWO YEARS &quot;in case data is needed to help prosecute a criminal.&quot;<br />Any smart criminal would use TOR, VPN or use another location. If this law goes through, ISP&#039;s will have to retain data for two years which will cost them enormous amounts of money and that will be passed on to the consumer. As if living in Australia isn&#039;t already expensive enough. There is so many things the Gillard Government is doing a terrible job of. This needs a topic on the philosophy section. I will get around to starting a thread about Australian politics in the next few weeks when I have a bit more time. <br /><br />The budget they just announced is a total disaster as well. Promising a budget surplus, but instead they created one of the largest deficits on record (for Australia).<br />The faster they repay the debt (within reason), the better. The money that would otherwise be sent on interest in the years to come could otherwise be spent on things that are really needed.

Just judging by that and this quote I believe he did get busted. &quot;A drug dealer&#039;s February arrest in New Zealand was referred to as the first ever criminal conviction involving a Silk Road transaction. Federal police said they were able to gain information about the dealer from his Silk Road profile, so they warned others that the marketplace is not entirely anonymous.&quot; Don&#039;t think he revealed anything on his profile but rather was caught through selling in real life or crappy posting/using easily traced courier services..

				Couple of thoughts/points; re getting caught driving; ironically a couple of our biggest busts have been flukes; can pulled over for some stupid reason, turns out it&#039;s got buckets (literally) of pills in it is one that springs to mind.<br /><br />There&#039;s dumb dealers getting busted offline all the time; people are kidding themselves if they think they can outwit the cops, just because it&#039;s online and in the post. That guy was getting caught at some stage, regardless. FFS he couldn&#039;t remember a url and password? Geesus.<br /><br />My tip, here and in real life; don&#039;t get cocky, don&#039;t get greedy. Fly under the radar and hope you don&#039;t end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, like a random pullover (if it was that). And FFS don&#039;t think you&#039;re smarter than the cops; remember ever professional around the world is pulling together to fight this place because the mums and dads of the world demand their children are safe from the scourge of drugs and demand the politicians do something.

				I don&#039;t know the full facts of this case. Having his SilkRoad username and password stored on his phone though, what the fuck was he thinking? That was really dumb. If he was convicted based on SR records, this makes me think vendors should have a kind of doomsday button which permanently erases all feedback, transaction history etc, for a circumstance such as this. Having SilkRoad records used against you in court would really, really suck. <br /><br />And what&#039;s with $14K of illicit funds, just laying around the house? I would have dug a hole so deep they would never have found it.

Drugs are illegal, but for what reason? It has been proven that alcohol is far more harmful and addictive than some illegal drugs, yet people selling them or using them are criminals? It doesn&#039;t make sense, but the vast majority of the population is too stupid to use their own brains and think beyond what the Government has told them and many people are actually terrified of drugs. Some people believe that if they smoke marijuana, that will be their gateway drug to heroin, and if they try marijuana just once, they will end up being a junkie living on the street. <br /><br />So this guy made mistakes, but now he is in jail and the rest of his life will be ruined because of his convictions. Travelling overseas will be difficult, getting a job, etc.<br /><br />And yes Australia is a nanny country already and it is only get worse rapidly. I don&#039;t understand why people diminish their freedom and demand the Government protect them from every potential threat. Nick Xenophon is one of the worst. I don&#039;t see why the Government has to regulate every aspect of everything from wearing helmets on bicyles to trying to limit pokie machines. Do people have no self-control to be able to stop themselves from playing pokie machines? I just don&#039;t see the point in limiting bets to $1. And then we have the internet filter and the long list of banned movies and books in Australia because the classification board thinks they are too violent. Can&#039;t adults decide what they watch? Why does Australia always need edited games and movies, simply because the Government says it&#039;s too inappropriate?

				This is purely a guess, but based on a few of the reported facts, this bloke could be the former vendor DownUnderDan. The dates seem to line up between when his vendor&#039;s account was taken over by an unknown person purporting to be him (before eventually and some what mysteriously coming to a sudden close) and when this guy was arrested back in April 2012. He is also the only vendor I can recall selling only MDMA and Ice. I can&#039;t remember him selling Ketamine but I could be wrong. He also might have had the Ket for personal use only and not for sale. The MDMA and Ice only theory seems to be supported with the police detailing an entry on his SR Homepage stating - <br /><br />An entry on the site spruiking Owen&#039;s wares promised &quot;high quality crystal meth and high end MDMA&quot;. <br /><br />I am 95% sure that DownUnderDan used the following line (below) on his Homepage too as it rings a bell for me - <br /><br />&quot;My goal is a happy customer, unlike most (not all) meth dealers you meet face to face,&quot; Owen wrote in an April 18, 2012, entry on the site.<br /><br />I know some people thought he was from QLD but I can&#039;t think of anyone else it could possibly be. That combined with the date he was arrested and the type of drugs he sold has me thinking it&#039;s him. The only other vendor that was busted during that time period from memory was DopeBoyAus, but he never sold Meth or Ketamine.<br /><br />Any other thoughts guys??<br />

I know the Police here will arrest some people for carrying a pill but having been on both sides of fence, I&#039;ll take the Australian Police over an American Officer any day of the week.

US drug laws are a fucking disgrace to humanity, there is little to be gained from making comparisons, countries not far from where I live kill you if they catch you with drugs, I stand by my comments, Australia&#039;s attitude and approach to drug legislation is draconian, if you could see how they waste tax dollars policing the nightclubs and streets of Sydney with sniffer dogs at 3am to catch a few kids with the odd ecstasy pill you would understand my perspective.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I have to agree with you. Whilst drug trafficking in the US might get you a longer prison sentence than in Australia, no other country waste the police resources and time that Australia does on catching drug users. People with personal amounts of drugs are targeted heavily here. Sniffer dogs are frequently at train stations, streets, nightclubs, always at festivals. All they do is catch end drug users and bring in revenue for the Government. Most possession of drug offences are just a fine, possibly with a conviction recorded.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree that Australian Police do waste a lot of time and money busting drug users and low level street dealers, but they are no where near like the Police in the US, not even in the same league. They operate buy / busts in some states arresting people and taking them to gaol for making a $10 purchase of crack. I know the Police here will arrest some people for carrying a pill but having been on both sides of fence, I&#039;ll take the Australian Police over an American Officer any day of the week. The US put a lot of resources into street level dealers and users and are like a dog with a bone if they suspect something is up. You would have to stand out like dogs balls here for a copper to search your car or yourself in my opinion. I&#039;ve been pulled over many times in my life and have never been, nor has my vehicle been, searched. I&#039;ve digressed a little there, sorry about that!!<br /><br />jjandall, are you sure DBA was from QLD?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Will PM you, but yeah 100% sure he&#039;s QLD.

It&#039;s nice to see I&#039;m not the only one who thinks this way. It seems that most of the population is happy to sit back and accept that everything that is not beneficial to the economy or potentially unhealthy be banned. Nothing infuriates me more than seeing the Government ban things because if they are banned, they will &quot;help economic growth.&quot; Fuck economic growth. I would rather be able to choose what I do in my lifetime and enjoy my life than lad a dull lifestyle with boundaries and restrictions on everything and have 5% more money to spend.<br /><br />I don&#039;t smoke, but I think tobacco should be legal for anyone who is old enough to make their decisions (18+) because it doesn&#039;t affect me, same with gay marriage and gay rights and every other thing that harms nobody but the person concerned. I really cannot see why gay people can&#039;t get married. It makes people happy, so why not allow it? I understand some Christian groups are against it, but it still doesn&#039;t affect them, What about Julia Gillard? She is an atheist and she is still against gay marriage - She has no reason not to allow it other than because she is controlling and manipulative. Pokie machines aren&#039;t of much interest to me either, but I still like the fact that if I ever want to use one, I can.<br /><br />Fast food is by far the biggest health concern in Australia, yet it is totally ignored. I am against tax hikes for unhealthy food, because I know that it would start out as a small tax on some items and then gradually increase and extend to more and more food groups. I think the Government should encourage healthy eating, but no further action is needed. People need to take responsibility for themselves. The more the Government restricts things and governs every aspect of everything, the less responsibility people will take for themselves. It will spiral out of control and in the end everyone will be told exactly what to do and what not to do because they do not know how to take responsibility for themselves. It is already heading that way. I know people on here will call me out for saying what I&#039;m saying is extreme, but if it keeps going the way it is, it will end up like that.<br /><br />I think it is quite contradictory to see people coming on to the forum of a drug-selling website and saying pokie machines should be banned because they aren&#039;t beneficial to society. We are all here because we use drugs, which are NOT beneficial. Yes, they are fun and can expand our thought processes, but they are in no way beneficial. Drugs make our lives more interesting and give us something else to enjoy, just as pokie machines would do for other people.

				Scary that a vendor keeps so much information that could be incriminating to his customers.<br />I hope that he was an outlier, and he got caught because of his more unprofessional conduct.<br />Makes me wonder if there is a benefit in using several buying accounts, as LE would target bigger customers first.<br /><br />Bitcoins seem to open up a new avenue of being unfairly f**ked in court, because I think working out the real amount in the local currency is far beyond most LE.

If you can&#039;t understand that eating take away fish and chips every day will eventually cause you to gain weight in comparison to eating a salad sandwich instead, then you&#039;re not being honest with yourself and need to do some reading to familiarize yourself with the reasons why.<br />Some common sense combined with you taking responsibility for your own actions in life is all one needs to succeed and live a forfilling and enjoyable life. Being tied down with excessive laws and regulations for everything we do in life will just over complicate things even more than they already are.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yep. 100% agree with you again! Personal responsibility with freedom of choice is how it should work. <br />However we have scum in our society who always blame someone else for their problems.

I understand that a lot of people need protection from certain things, but it seems wrong to limit others freedom of choice at the same time. There should be an equilibrium, but I feel that the equilibrium is constantly shifting and limits are being put on too many things. It&#039;s going too far. When you have laws being proposed that will completely illegalise tobacco, I just think that is wrong. I don&#039;t even smoke, but I think that it should be an option. Smoking is unhealthy, but it&#039;s not destroying society. Drugs are illegal, yet I still use them as do tens of millions of people worldwide. It seems unfair to imprison drug users - Decriminalization of drugs would be a step in the right direction.<br /><br />

It&#039;s a choice that an individual will make based on what they know about a particular subject. Sure, at times we can all get a little down on ourselves through circumstances which really make life hard, such as a death of someone close, a loss of your job or bugger all money to spend on some of life&#039;s pleasures.<br />However, we are all born as equals in the sense that every child is able to get an education through the local Public and High Schools. School fees are not compulsory for parents to pay, although most do pay them. There has been advertisements at various locations for many, many years, mainly public areas and alike and with the invention of the TV, that has continued to grow to it&#039;s current state today. To suggest that advertising is the reason your being forced to buy something is crazy. Again, instead of blaming the media, we should look at taking some personal responsibility for the choices we make. We all have choices to make at certain times in life which will affect our lives dramatically. <br />If you give a child an unhealthy hamburger and some vegetables, what will he/she eat. The answer is what ever they get to eat from me which I feel is suitable for their needs at the time. If they don&#039;t like it, they won&#039;t be eating. I guarantee you though that the kids will eat virtually anything you give them if you establish the boundaries with them early on and stick to them. If a parent curtails to the ads on TV (fast food) as a result of the kids having a tantrum then you&#039;re setting a precedent for your kids on what they have to do to get what they want. Kids need to be guided through life with a set of boundaries for them not to cross. Explain to them that if they break the rules by crossing the boundary, there will be consequences for their actions. If they break the rules, parents MUST follow through with a punishment so the kids know your serious about it and won&#039;t be backing down. They soon realize that if they stay within the boundary and play, they won&#039;t be in any trouble and can still enjoy themselves just as much. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> History tells us that letting people do what they want to do because of what you call freedom is just a way to let only some people overwhelm the economy by taking profit of the weaker. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Examples please to illustrate your point. This is simply not factual at all. We all have freedom as it stands. People should be allowed to do as they please as long as they do so without hurting others and within the laws and regulations set out by governments many years ago. These will require updates and new assessments should be done as times change. A law made in 1923 will no doubt need to be adjusted, tweaked, etc to work effectively in today&#039;s society. Each child is entitled to an education and by law, must attend school. Entitlements are what a person is entitled to as a result of the current minimum requirements set out in our Industry Standards. People create their own path in life through the decisions they make. At the end of the day, it their choice to make and theirs alone.

But you have to remember that information is the key ; if you are uneducated, you simply are unable to control yourself.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s not really the case.&nbsp; Informed, educated people make &#039;wrong&#039; decisions ALL the time, just like everyone else.&nbsp; Education, while &#039;helpful&#039; is not the &#039;be all and end all&#039; when making decisions.<br /><br />&nbsp;As people have &#039;feelings&#039; .. which are not &#039;facts&#039; and they do not neccesarily &#039;add up&#039;!&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider what could be called &quot;crimes of passion&quot; . . . there usually doesn&#039;t seem to be much &#039;logic&#039; being used during most, they are often split second decisions made in the heat of the moment, and the persons &#039;education&#039; per se, has little to do with their behaviour.<br /><br />Not that long ago it was sufficient to &#039;blame&#039; a moment of passion for someone dying at the hands of another!&nbsp; Esp &#039;partners&#039; . . . I know here iz Oz until the 1970&#039;s, this was a valid defense if you had killed your partner, and there are many people walking around today who never would see freedom again in todays world were they to do today what they did 40 years ago!<br /><br /><br />The real &#039;problem&#039; with our current &#039;nanny states&#039; is that people really dont care when things dont &#039;directly affect them&#039; and are complacent enough to let this shit happen<br /><br />Now this^^^&nbsp; IS a problem exacerbated by ignorance, and the better a person&#039;s knowledge about the topic which is often directly related to their education, is another thing altogether!<br /><br />interesting thread <br /><br />m m m motek
