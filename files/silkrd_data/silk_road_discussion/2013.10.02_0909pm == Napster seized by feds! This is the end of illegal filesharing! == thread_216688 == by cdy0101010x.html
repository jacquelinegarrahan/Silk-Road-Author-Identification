				Seriously, this means nothing. Don&#039;t let yourselves get intimidated by these incompetent morons, they didn&#039;t &quot;crack&quot; any kind of security, they didn&#039;t do this on their own, they had to rely on a few huge mistakes by DPR. These are mistakes that other admins on other sites won&#039;t make. Stay strong, keep fighting the good fight, etc.

				Yeah, that&#039;s what many of us have been saying since the beginning. I even used this specific example I think lol.<br /><br />Just like file sharing moved from centralized to decentralized, so will darknet drug markets. I doubt we&#039;ll see another big one quite as trusted and reliable as SR, but the practice will continue.

You could order something from somebody and check their reputation and ask around from people who have dealt with them. That&#039;s something you can&#039;t really even do on the streets. Sure there are other sites out there right now but do we trust them? That&#039;s the question. And file sharing isn&#039;t really the same. A lot of sites I used for torrents back in the day aren&#039;t up any more it seems harder to find what you&#039;re looking for these days.
