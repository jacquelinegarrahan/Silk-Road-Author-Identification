				If they don&#039;t say on the listing then pm them and ask. If no reply, go on to the next dealer. You do not ever want to sign for anything. Its considered evidence that you knew what was in the package and they can execute a search warrant soon as you sign. Use your correct name and address, when the package comes don&#039;t be in a big hurry to take it in. Take a little walk around the neighborhood to see if anyone is watching, if you are paranoid. Then take the package in. Or leave it overnight, they will not stake it out for any length of time. Basically, if you don&#039;t sign you are ok.

				This isnt always true. Ive ordered from overseas vendors and knew since it was registered and tracked international mail that i would need to sign for the package. Utilize these forums and use the knowledge from them to find reliable vendors. Ive signed for INTL packages from SR probably once or twice. LE hasnt kicked in my door yet, but i much rather prefer not signing.

				One thing to consider is that if you are receiving an Express package at a PO Box, it better fit in your box, or you will have to &quot;sign&quot; for it whether it is marked for no signature or not.&nbsp; Express envelopes are 12.5&quot; by 9.5&quot;, so keep that in mind.&nbsp; If you are receiving the order at an address, just ask the vendor to mark the package for no signature required.<br /><br />Any one with a PO Box needs to consider this.&nbsp; Some of the Priority envelopes are just as large, and the PO will require that you go to the counter to pick up the envelope because it won&#039;t fit in your box.&nbsp; Communicate with your vendor and they can usually accommodate you by using a smaller package or envelope.

				Honestly most people who give Po BOX has the smaller size.&nbsp; Most of the time have to pick it up at counter.&nbsp; Vendor should know that and make package as small as possible, but if possible. Some techniques require boxes not small enough.&nbsp; The only way to fit in Po BOX small is if its small package or flexible.&nbsp; I got small box, Big one is really fuckin expensive.

				There is an option on the Express mailing labels if the sender doesn&#039;t want to require signature - Waiver of Signature in a pink box. Most vendors are wise to check that box, to protect both involved. Some around here have said that USPS makes them sign even when the box is checked; I imagine this is often at the discretion of the postal worker (they are used to always taking a signature for Express).
