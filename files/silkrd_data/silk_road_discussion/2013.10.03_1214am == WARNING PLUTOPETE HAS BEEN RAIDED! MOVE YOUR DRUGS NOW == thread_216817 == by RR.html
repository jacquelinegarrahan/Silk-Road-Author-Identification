				Plutopete is not small. He is actually huge. He sells Powder bottles, snuff items, cocaine accessories but the biggest one is the Military Grade MBB. Maybe stolen stuff? Tax fraud as well.

				He used to buy from his vendor account without encrypting his address. He may have had the local police wanting an excuse to raid him for a while, unfortunately they may have been handed that information in the US investigation in to DPR.<br /><br />It all depends how good the SR self destruct system was, he was relying on that.<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame, he was polite and a great if occasional customer. <br /><br />If you have been ordering packaging materials for vending purposes I would be mildly concerned.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				my house phone is not at mt current location its redirected to a unregistered mobile phone! and i would guess they hit him hoping to find addresses of vendors and this is 100% connected as he said the police kept leaving the room to talk on the phone to the fbi team running the raids, they also kept asking him about the man they have and think is DPR.........

Take it out and take a sledge to it and smash it to smithereens. Makes sure you get the round platters inside the drive really good, smash the fuck out of them. Get rid of the pieces in a fire if you can, in a secluded river or even throw the a couple of pieces in various trash bins around town. <br /><br />Formatting does not erase data on the hard drive. It simply changes the file allocation table. A format C: can be recovered very easily without much tools, like anyone can do it with a bit of googling. You can write the drive with all 0&#039;s and that should do it, but there are papers out there that say even this can be recovered by sophisticated data recovery teams. Your best best is to destroy it, it&#039;s less than $100 for a new drive, probably less than $50. <br /><br />Good luck, stay safe.

				It depends on a few things, if they had a warrant which it sounds like they did then they have enough to do forensics on and recover a lot. There is going to be a lot of data destruction. The last thing I do before I retire for the evening is clear my work computer.<br /><br />I doubt he was running TAILS or anything other than windows, I suspect this given that he didn&#039;t encrypt his address when placing orders. That means trails that can be followed. All that I can say is bad times. It depends who is working on his data, if it&#039;s the local police then no worries but if they call in the big boys then they can drudge up a fair amount if at any point it was in ROM.<br /><br />Thank you for warning people though, that is noble of you RR.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor<br /><br />P.S. make sure you check my review thread update Abby.

				Agreed but I think they will be wanting to move fast on this, they won&#039;t be waiting for &#039;warrant day&#039; for these ones. Most areas once a month or so will do the roundups of people they want to pick up, they know the big boys are likely to scarper quickly so if they want them they will need to move fast. PlutoPete was easy as hell to find so fingers crossed they haven&#039;t got huge plans in mind.<br /><br />I am standing firm, I&#039;m not too scared for myself but I can understand why people are.I don&#039;t think a dragnet is closing in but they may have though they could catch the British &#039;wing&#039; of SR administration, I can imagine the police having that kind of lack of understanding in the UK.<br /><br />Do we know what the situation is? Bailed? Charged?

				I&#039;m glad that i recently moved my operation over the border.. Already thought it was fishy that ST was moving his operation You know shit is going down when the #1 starts disappearing Thank god that i never shipped anything to the US Just for the sheer fact that i knew this beautiful place was going to get busted one day /or me\ If i would have sold to the US i wouldn&#039;t be able to sleep ever again Id even shit bricks in Honolulu or any other beautiful island.. Surely opening up to the US or any other high risk country would be mad money Look at super trips how he exploded when he started selling to the US not only him also Frank and others.. The amount of requests i got from Americans shipping to them is just insane and im glad i declinded everytime and stuck to my personal rule NO USA&nbsp; ???&nbsp; I cant imagine how any vendor that sold to the US is able to sleep at night ...<br /><br />... anyhow moving to BMR and sheep will be shipping from Germany with the same oldschool stealth massive discounts as a opening guys;;; hope to see you guys in a better situation .. SR was a great experience<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... Send my regards to pluto pete i always liked the presence of that fellow on the forums

				Glad to hear you&#039;re ok (probably a bit weird coming from a stranger). We heard about your arrest earlier, I thought it was solely a US operation, but guess not. Wonder if any other countries are involved...

				Glad to hear you&#039;re a free(ish) man PlutoPete, thanks for posting that update, it is important to know what &#039;they&#039; know as best we can. <br /><br />They clearly hadn&#039;t done their homework on you, I&#039;m really not sure how they managed to get a warrant, the judge must have been seriously misled as to the nature of your business.

				Wow, it reminds me of the time a local head shop owner was consulted by the constabulary because they knew he was more familiar with the changes in drug law than they were, they were trying to figure out whether shrooms were illegal about 2 years after the law changed.<br /><br />I really hope you pursue them for their wrongful and ignorant actions, it was plain as day to anyone with half a brain that you were the most above board person on here. I wish I could be there to see the disappointment on their little faces when the reagent tests come back and they owe you a new door.<br /><br />I may be somewhat mistaken but this really does make the UK side of the investigation look inept, they can&#039;t even keep track of publicly available data. Although it is deeply concerning that a judge issued that warrant, what are the odds that he is one of the many nonses in the judicial system...<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				hey plutopete you realize that you are still aiding a criminal enterprise by being a vendor, even if you sell legal products? The commissions paid support the site. I hope they dont pick up on that. Probably best not to sue them for being dicks.

IF ANYTHING, the only thing that POSSIBLY could be put on you would be avoiding paying tax on the items which is highly unlikely as the hardly have a whole lost of all you ever sold or they would&#039;ve known not to raid the place at all for legal items....<br /><br />Go away railroaddowner!

Names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses will be going into their research suite and I would expect their analysts are busy graphing away as we speak.<br /><br />Be prepared for sure - take steps. Telephones and clearnet comms are their favorite technique for graphing because they are cheap and access is easy for them via NTAC - but once they have designated you as high value they are resourced enough to have blokes sat outside in a 4x4 for a bit of up close.<br /><br />Be safe<br /><br />

				Whoa! First of all, definitely +1 to plutopete. I&#039;m sorry about what happened to you, especially on your birthday.

Of course, it&#039;s up to you though. If I were you, I&#039;d talk to my private attorney about it because there could be a good amount to gain from it. Not to mention, if you succeeded, it might make LE think twice before making raids related to SR...just suff to think about.
