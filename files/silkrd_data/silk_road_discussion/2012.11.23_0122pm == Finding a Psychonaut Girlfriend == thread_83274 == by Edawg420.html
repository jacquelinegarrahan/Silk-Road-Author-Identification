				So in light of the SR downtime, i am deciding to express some of my fantasies if you will?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if there are many out there but does anybody else feel like a down ass cutie that loves getting high on LSD/DMT/MDMA would be THE one?<br /><br />IDK if you readers have ever seen the you tube video &quot;Underground LSD Palace&quot; but pretty much Kystale Cole, back in the day of course, is by far the most sexiest little thing i have ever seen.&nbsp; They had an underground PALACE filled with exotic carpets and statues...their own personal chemists and whatever amounts of tryptamines they could ever want.<br /><br />I know i am just having some pipe dreams but could you imagine experiencing the intimate psychedelic states with your lover in a secret underground palace?&nbsp; I know i obviously don&#039;t have kilo&#039;s of LSD crystal and 100,000 of dollars to blow, but i could definitely spend the rest of my life tripping balls every day with some cutie =P<br /><br />Anyways i was just wondering how and if you other psychonauts found your psychedelic cuties... every girl i try and convince to do DMT or LSD thinks i&#039;m some sorta drug addict lol...Maybe i need to make a trip to Burning Man this year and just scoop some straight hippie chick =P<br /><br />Aww well happy tripping!<br /><br />

				Go to your local coffeeshop, preferably the one with a good rep for frequent good looking female customers..&nbsp; Bring a few William S. Burroughs books, start reading em...<br /><br />And hope that one bites.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Just make sure they aren&#039;t borderline, that could ruin what could have been an awesome couples trip.<br /><br />This may not be the best advice, but I&#039;m sure it would work better then a craigslist ad stating:<br /><br />&quot;LOOKING FOR THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS, CHANGA SMOKERS AND TAB DROPPERS PREFERRED&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				They do exist. Me!<br /><br />And I have the same dream to find somebody who enjoys drugs, but very moderately. So that I can experience having sex on mephedrone or LSD. I was thinking of finding somebody on a festival, but I decided against it. I don&#039;t want to put myself in a dangerous situation and also I don&#039;t like to treat me or my body carelessly.<br /><br />Are you afraid that if you meet somebody who is into drugs it might trigger more use or even leads to addiction? I am.

				A year or three back I couch surfed with a girl in Paris. I normally don&#039;t make a move when I&#039;m surfing with a girl, it can be tricky and there&#039;s etiquette to consider. And they&#039;re usually short stays, I was planning on only staying a night or two with this particular host before moving on to the next. But the first night she brings out a bottle of Spanish Absinthe and a baggie of weed and hash (unfortunately no LSD etc). Turned out to be one of the best weeks of my trip. Smoking joints on the Seine, wandering through the Louvre baked out of our minds.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t had near as much luck finding a like minded girl back home. Maybe I&#039;m just running in the wrong circles. :\

				Ha! I married one but here I sit without Lucy having touched my lips for years now. Careful what you wish for!<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine how shit it would be to have to hide my habits from my other half.<br /><br />And for me, the acid rush is the biggest aphrodisiac in the world. If you can do something with it while you still have enough motor control, wow - best sex ever. Beats Viagra for sure ;)

				Yeah, we&#039;re out there.<br /><br />The deal is though, if you&#039;re looking for someone a bit more grown up we&#039;re not going to be easy to find. We wear normal clothing, and we&#039;re pretty unlikely to actually talk about tripping with you unless we know you well because we&#039;re professionals and we know that looking like a drug user isn&#039;t going to serve our other goals. Basically, you&#039;re just going to have to meet a lot of women and talk about your interest in drugs with us in a way that communicates that you&#039;re also a grown up about your drug use.<br /><br />Let me give you another hint: lots of us are academics and smart women. So yeah, that tip about reading Burroughs might be a good start. Here&#039;s another hint: if you go to a party, the ladies there outside smoking a joint might be interested in other recreational substances. Maybe start up a conversation about de Quincey or Benjamin ?

				the girls that catch you´re eye at the raves. They don&#039;t much care where the money comes from as long as they´re not sober..<br /><br />The prefect middle is this: <br /><br />Treats her body with respect<br />Intelligent<br />Uses not to escape, but to share journeys.&nbsp; To experience herself and you but not for the sake of not being sober. <br />Focused on something IRL, career, business etc.. something to keep the cogs turning.. <br /><br />They exist :D I dated one for two years, but then had to move out here for my business, I couldn´t ask her to give up her life and come here. we still speak but fuck I miss it. LOL theres always others.. Best ways to find them? doing something you love and looking around you to see who is watching :D<br /><br />IMO I prefer geek girls to straight out trip heads.. But its good to have both

				i was in love with a girl for about 5 years and occasionally she would smoke weed and drink.&nbsp; when she found out i was doing opiates, she fucking flipped out and eventually we broke up.&nbsp; It was more of the stigma attached to doing pills, because my drug use was not adversely affecting our relationship in any way.&nbsp; Its so ironic how some of these girls claim to be feminists, preaching womens rights, but when it comes to MY body as a guy, they want to put all these rules and restrictions on me on what i can and cant do with my body.&nbsp; &nbsp;fucking hypocrites some claimed feminists can be. I could have had a couple good relationships, but women always seem to want to be control freaks and put all theses laws down of what i can&#039;t do, when the only thing i ask for is to them to love me and be monogamous.&nbsp;

				I met this girl that was fantastic. We did meth almost every day of the week. Really fun times as you can imagine. We over time became best friends and she was the only person i would kill my bag with and she always returned the favor when she had some. Sometimes finding someone of the opposite sex that is a friend is better than trying to date them. That doesn&#039;t cut you out of hot kinky sex just because she&#039;s your friend.<br /><br />Eventually, we drifted apart because we couldn&#039;t afford each others use and started smoking alone. When she was out, i didn&#039;t call her. When i was out she didn&#039;t call me. I know it sounds shallow but it worked wonderfully. Then she left state in the hopes of quitting and i hope she&#039;s able to quit. I didn&#039;t see her showing signs of problems, but if she had to skip town because of it. Maybe, she was better at hiding it then i knew. Hopefully one day our paths shall cross again.<br /><br />Keep searching, you would be surprised who enjoys drugs as much as yourself. Normally the ones you can&#039;t tell use are the best because they have responsibilities and know how to keep their shit together.

				I found her, and yes, she is the one! Not only is she a professional/hardworking lady in her business life, but she comes home and wants to mix up some MDMA and MDA together and go on adventures into wonderland and watch cute movies and make out all night! Sometimes she wants pretty colors and sparks, so we dose some LSD and dance our brains out at a show! Then sometimes (rarely, but sometimes) we just wanna zonk out, so we rail some dillaudid and roxi together and have downer cuddle parties! It&#039;s the definition of amazing, and I&#039;ma hold on to her forever!.&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;ve been truly blessed with my significant other.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been together for years and she was a total goody goody when we met.&nbsp; We&#039;ve grown together over the years and she&#039;s experimented with many substances with me.&nbsp; She particularly enjoys pure MDMA and the white speakers from ST.<br /><br />We also have quite a wealth of experiences with various psychedelics from shrooms(cubes and cyans) to lsd to dmt and beyond to research chemicals.&nbsp; She is incredibly intelligent and currently makes more money for me(a nice change since i&#039;ve always supported her :D).&nbsp; <br /><br />I had a pretty good foundation in the drug culture prior to our meeting, but since we&#039;ve grown together in incredible ways.&nbsp; I am SO lucky to have this relationship with her.&nbsp; Eating acid on our birthdays and going to a few raves has certainly been fun. :)&nbsp; She does seem to be incredibly sensitive to psychedelics, and in fact, most psychoactive drugs in general.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first time we ate mushrooms together we were at my bud dealers house and i gave her a gram of cubensis.&nbsp; She fried her FACE OFF for over 8 hours.&nbsp; As in, at T+8 hours she was face down in the corner of the couch insisting she was on a huge blue rollercoaster! haha.<br /><br />It was pretty amazing till the neighbor girl starting smashing on the door with tears running down her face screaming about her junkie boyfriend and 4 cops, two with k9&#039;s rolled up into the driveway we shared with her.&nbsp; <br /><br />All in all the night ended alright for everyone but it was HELLA sketch!

				I am really lucky. Literally, the luckiest guy on earth. My girlfriend, who used to model for various photo shoots and commercials, is also a nerd and a psychonaut. She has done 25c-Nbome with me, LSD, shrooms, 6-apb, weed, etc. She plays online MMO games with me when we&#039;re bored, like league of legends, guild wars 2, etc.<br /><br />Only problem is I&#039;ve gotten in my fair share of brawls due to guys checking her out or trying to get in close and shit, and I am a jealous/violent type and will have none of that shit. I could do without that. And she can be way too talkative/annoying at times, but that is just my dick side speaking. She does everything to show love for me, and I&#039;d be lost without her helping me with little shit. <br /><br />tl;dr - I have a hot ass latina bombshell who is a nerd and a psychonaut. Go me.

				Ty you all for your posts!<br /><br />I read through them all and i have to agree with most of you, it sounds like some of you have found people you care about and enjoy spending time with.&nbsp; Feeling drugs like coke, opiates, and booze always lead to an addiction, well at least like 93% of the time lol... Personally i have had those girlfriends that liked to get down on an 8 ball all night with me, but like someone shared earlier in the thread, this will most certainly lead to selfishness and mistrust. But god what a rush in the beginning eh?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how many of you have fully embraced DMT, but i swear i felt once i returned i had this source of knowledge that our materialistic and drone struggle for money and social acceptance is what&#039;s really corrupting our souls.&nbsp; When i fully broke through on DMT i witnessed what i would consider god, divinity and pure exquisite bliss.<br /><br />My dream i guess is to share psychedelics with another person preferably my soul mate if you will, and truly explore the imagination of our minds.&nbsp; Remember the movie Inception?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure some of you all hate it and some all love it but one thing stood out more than anything when i watched it.&nbsp; When DeCaprio told his partner that the girl architect, who just had a full dream like awakening, would be back.&nbsp; He asked &quot;how can you be sure?&quot; and he replied &quot;once your mind has been open there is no closing it&quot;.&nbsp; Something on those lines i am doing it no justice by paraphrasing from memory.<br /><br />There has to be people out there that enjoy using psychedelics once a month and not just to get fucked up, but to experience and cherish the brilliant adventures of our mind.<br /><br /><br />

				I met a girl and we had soooo much fun together. We used to go out to raves and take MDMA, or just go to the beach and take some MDMA, make out and watch the sun rise that sorta thing. Smoke weed and watch good/bad movies, listen and talk about music together. Or just generally being together, no drugs just love. We genuinely fell so deeply in love. We didn&#039;t need to be always under the influence, we just chose to accentuate what we had like once a month or so. Like someone said, not to escape but to explore and reflect and generally be grateful for each other, the world and the experiences. Seriously, I was in heaven. I wondered what I done in a past life to be enjoying such a happy existence.<br /><br />Fast forward 10 years and we&#039;re still together but things have changed significantly. <br /><br />These days we both have to work in the week and do it because we have responsibilities, bills and all that stuff that you seem to have to do for your own space. We do it with enthusiasm because with the way the world is at the moment, if I didn&#039;t it would mean living apart with our respective folks (too independent for that now). I don&#039;t feel the need to have a release / exploration session every week because I a) respect my body b) want to save some cash and c) don&#039;t feel the need. But from time to time I need to let go. To push the reset button, get back to being me instead of the corporate douche I have to pretend to be to succeed in my job. However she has stopped. In one way or another I find a way but I know she doesn&#039;t like it. I don&#039;t want to to hide it because that&#039;s a mistrustful road to go down but it&#039;s just not the same, I would much rather do it with her. I don&#039;t force her or make her feel bad for it because I don&#039;t want to push anyone into something they&#039;re not feel comfortable with. <br /><br />I suspect (and fear) she&#039;s let her mindset and therefore choices be influenced by the ignorant and overly conservative around her. Anyway, for now we&#039;re going in the same direction, but on different paths. Sooner or later the paths will go in different directions and one of us is going to need to switch paths if we&#039;re to stay together. Knowing what I know about myself, life and the path she has chosen, it ain&#039;t gonna be me. I just can&#039;t go down that road, the one that just believes whatever you&#039;re told, becoming what you do for a job and keeping up appearances because &#039;people will talk&#039;. She seems hell bent on well, becoming like most women I meet. Obvious, predictable and materialistic. I have no idea how this will ever get resolved other than with a lot of pain for both parties.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83274.msg620108#msg620108">Quote from: CiscoYankerStuck on November 24, 2012, 06:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">.....

				I know I was looking for the same thing, and learned you have to be very careful in your search. When I met my current gf, we worked together and were really shy around each other. There was a bit of puppy love, I suppose, that made the relationship seem that much better. The first date, I actually took her on was just up on a hill overlooking the downtown skyline to burn some trees. Prior to this, she had been drunk one time. That is the extent of her consciousness being altered. Of course, the only reason she even tried smoking was because she had a crush on me. A week and a half later, I got her to go to the rave club my friends and I frequented. She dropped some E with me. This started a six month period of us doing this activity every weekend. Now, I smoked everyday, drank somewhat frequently, loved and still love to do psychedelics and took painkillers fairly often as well.All she did was roll, early Sunday mornings. When I dropped, I would take 6-10 pills a night or knock out a G of Molly. She never took more than two or three, maybe .4 of the pure in a night. Obviously, I was way farther out than she was. The last time we went to the club, we got some awesome pills and they were a bit stronger than what she was used to and rolled way too hard, for her to be comfortable. Let&#039;s just say it was a very interesting night. After that we stopped... Well she did. I just moved over to dropping LSD on the weekends mixed in with rolls at parties and such, just not as often. Still smoked and still drank. About two months later, we found out she was pregnant. Being as careless and swept away in love as we were, it was not a real big deal. I really slowed down on my intake of the chemicals and alcohol, except for the herb. Three or four months into the pregnancy, we found out how different we are and the separation of us two became very apparent. And karma, being the wondrously fair entity that it is, threw as many curve balls in my life as possible, after the period of perfection. This relationship has taken it&#039;s share of lumps and bruises. Since then, it has been a struggle to stay genuinely happy. My daughter is now two years old and the best thing to ever happen to us, but my gf and I&#039;s relationship suffers. I lover her to death and appreciate her, for everything she has given me, but some times there is nothing to keep two people together. The vast differences in our up-bringings, hobbies, friends, levels of intellectuality and just states of being are just more than one relationship can survive. Luckily, the blessing of a child is more than strong enough to make it worth it. All in all, this is exactly what I asked for and the exact opposite of what I wanted. Love is magical and so are drugs. However, life is still life and it keeps going, with or without the drugs. The only advice I have for you is, before you lose yourself, make sure you know it&#039;s real.

Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because its only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die.

I hope so, I really do, but hope and reality are often worlds apart. You imagine this guy, your perfect mirror you see his qualities and how they fit perfectly, like a key into your perfect ideal of a boyfriend. Life is rarely like that, you´ll meet someone, it may be perfect at the start, but people, we believe we see them change. The more we push them to be something perfect the more they change into something that´s not... I´ve always experienced that when I´m with someone the first few months are perfect, then the arguments come as you take each other for granted. You feel like you see a new side to them, when in reality this is not true, all you are seeing is what they always were, but you got bored of that.. loosing my ex taught me never to be complacent and never take anyone for granted. To enjoy, love and cherish every moment and to never ever go into a relationship hoping someone will be something in particular. Now when I enter into a relationship I hope for nothing but company and love, the two things that come naturally. Learn to love someone for who they are and dont love someone because you think they are someone else... <br />I am really really high so not sure that made sense<br />

				Guys, do you all realize how dangerous mixing psychedelics with a relationship is?<br /><br />Imagine feeling things for someone that were only brought on by a drug.. You don&#039;t get to see them for who they are, you see them fucked up and your perception of them is altered in the long term until you finally sober up and realize who you thought you were dating really isn&#039;t who you thought they were.. I&#039;m not saying this is true for every single relationship out there, but after burning ourselves into the ground in my last relationship, I will never take psychedelics with someone who I just started dating.&nbsp; They&#039;re too personal to start fucking with.&nbsp; I also feel like when you have sex on psychedelics it&#039;s like a violation of the other person&#039;s soul.. like you leave an imprint forever that they might not ever get over because of how intense that moment is/was.&nbsp; Just be careful people... last thing you want is to think you fell in love with the wrong person because cuddling on LSD/MDMA just felt &quot;so good&quot;<br /><br />You were fucked up, it wasn&#039;t real.. maybe I&#039;m just bitter but I read a previous post here that said something along the same lines..

				We (posted in the singular for the duration to ease comprehension) believe a few things are important to remember.<br /><br />As many have posted or alluded to, it&#039;s extremely important to find someone who is on the same level as you when not on drugs. Psychedelics and MDXX have a funny way of making everything wonderful. The unfortunate side-effect is they create connections with people that otherwise wouldn&#039;t be there. Most of us have seen the couple making out in the corner and thought &quot;That is the weirdest couple I&#039;ve ever seen&quot;. This is especially important for those of you who are past the &quot;party&quot; stage; looking for someone with matured goals and drug use. Relationships cannot be based solely on the couples affinity for drugs. Intellect, physical attraction, moral center, world views, and a multitude of other facets play a large part in the compatibility of couples. <br /><br />I like the suggestion to sit in a coffee shop reading a book that lets others know you are an alternative thinker. That signals to the other person that you can read (always a plus), you&#039;re smart enough to keep your alternative lifestyle on the DL (you&#039;re intelligent, and you have something valuable enough in your life that you protect it by not flaunting your views), and invites them to have a conversation with you. I personally find it fun to drop subtle hints during casual conversations about my views, and have been quite surprised when certain people are both intelligent and experienced enough to get the reference. <br /><br />I would suggest building relationships by being honest about (but abstaining from) drug use until both of you have built a solid foundation and are willing to move to the next level. Building a relationship takes patience and hard work, and deferring your gratification until both parties have a deeper understanding and affection for each other will aid greatly in increasing the chances of success. <br /><br />All this ofc assumes you have reached the stage in life where you desire more than constantly partying and instant gratification. If that&#039;s where you are, it&#039;s as easy as going to a show, rave, festival etc. and finding someone tripping/rolling/trolling face and hang on for the ride :P<br /><br />

				Synchronicity, this thread. Something I&#039;ve been thinking about lately, as I&#039;m considering doing the internet dating thing after the breakup of a looooong relationship, and all the sites ask about drug use and here&#039;s the thing: no one ever admits to it. At least not around here. (I know exactly where I could go and what old friends I could hang out with to find a girl like this, but sadly, I can&#039;t realistically make that happen) All the women I meet are of two types: the never-ever straight edge types and the &quot;used to but now I&#039;ve grown up&quot; types.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83274.msg618485#msg618485">Quote from: TreeSpirit on November 23, 2012, 01:54 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Are you afraid that if you meet somebody who is into drugs it might trigger more use or even leads to addiction?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s my reservation about &quot;converting&quot; a straight edge type. I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re natural born dragon chasers and frankly neither do they.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83274.msg621623#msg621623">Quote from: ikz on November 24, 2012, 06:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Guys, do you all realize how dangerous mixing psychedelics with a relationship is?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I get this concern regarding drug use in general but it&#039;s so not my experience with psychedelics. The only &quot;downside&quot; on psychedelics I can see is that there&#039;s no getting around your true feelings, true likes and dislikes, for the sake of a bit of convenient but otherwise incompatible company. Take a room full of so-so friends, share some shrooms, and see all the undercurrents and true feelings come to brilliant hypercolour life. There&#039;s no way to not be you, and the purest, most honest version of you. Quite an amazing state of vulnerability to share, really, and definitely make or break. <br />

				why am I only seeing this thread now? :D it&#039;s really sweet.<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak to psychedelics.. I&#039;ve actually never tried them ( would love to with a trusted partner) but my best, sweetest relationship was one that involved recreational drug use. It&#039;s a shame relationships like that get pigeonholed. We had amazing, transcendent times with music, spending times with friends, and just talking and knowing each other and living in our sexual nervous system. Fucking magic. I&#039;d kill to find a man who&#039;s capable of enjoying drugs in that way again.

				Greetings fellow psychonauts!<br /><br /><br />I am writing this now, about 12-18 hours after i had dropped 3 Myan tolkein calendars from 3jane... the visuals....the feeling... was there but i felt there was something missing...probably because i had a bad tripping buddy....as he was a novice and never tried LSD before.... not to mention i lost an important spring i needed for my volcano (vaporizer) on my multi colored carpet....talk about needle in a hay stack...when i finally gave up and packed DMT crudely into a bowl and was able to smoke it, i felt what you could consider pure creationism engulf my very existence.&nbsp; I ask myself...wtf am i wasting my time with LSD for.... i&#039;ll never get my hands on that pure ass shit they had back in the 60&#039;s.... should we all just stick to DMT?<br /><br />THIS is the experience i want to experience with my true love... if we can not connect spiritually then how can we connect in this physical world we exist in?<br /><br />I feel this thread has lost my meaning, i am talking more about sharing your psychedelic journeys and desires with a partner, or your true love.

				Hey Edawg, I think I understand. I would love to have shared the experience of drugs together with my love (sadly he died). Maybe I will someday and maybe I won&#039;t. <br />Even though the subject strayed maybe from what you intended. I am happy it did, because it made me think.Especially with psycedelics, I don&#039;t think it will be the right thing to do (for me) to do it with an (almost) stranger.&nbsp; I want to be careful with my body and soul. I would rather do it with somebody I truly love. But (as the point you already raised) it might not be best thing to get involved with somebody who does drugs.<br />As this thread proves, there are some sound people around though!

				&nbsp;:&#039;(<br />As one of the F.O.G. (Fucking Old Guys) that has actually survived the mistakes of his life, I found out that often what we think we want is something we really didn&#039;t consider and may be extremely bad for us and our health.<br /><br />Take, for instance:&nbsp; Titty-dancer girlfriend / Penthouse Pet&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Absolutely, if you had spoken to me when I was 14 years while I had my dick in my hand, I absolutely would have told you that some Penthouse Pet was absolutely on list of ideal girlfriend material, and someone like Jenny McCarthy would have topped the list.&nbsp; But let&#039;s be honest: to stand out twenty years later among 240 other naked hotties per publication means that Jenny and Sara Jean are more than just a body and pretty face; they have the total package.&nbsp; ;) Who wouldn&#039;t want to live in Sara Jean&#039;s apartment and play strip poker with a fire in the hearth drinking cosmos!?!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />But in real life, you find that everyone is damaged and no one is fucking air brushed, except while they&#039;re onstage.&nbsp; If that fine pussy is fucking you like you never expected, and you&#039;re NOT the fella that taught her to fuck that way, then you&#039;re in a bit of a spot, because you&#039;re just another number until she finds someone to take her to what SHE CONSIDERS the next level in the video game, not what you consider the next level.... ???<br /><br />Let me assure you, there are absolutely plenty of club girls and basic strippers that if you just become a customer, rather than a sexual observer, they will-- after awhile-- begin to recognize you and act just like a waitress at a diner, except they&#039;re nude and super expensive.&nbsp; Many of them are single mothers and strip to support their children.&nbsp; They do not strip because it makes them feel super sexy and their vagina has brought them to dance their incandescent passion onstage and on your crotch.&nbsp; They dance to make more money than a good lawyer does in a year.&nbsp; But they can only dance for the big bills for maybe 15 years tops- TOPS- unless they have a favored clientele which they have built up over time to support them in their middle age.&nbsp; Strippers might not consciously know that ALL that keeps them in the necessary cases of feminine deodorant spray is their physical appearance and youth, but they absolutely subconsciously do.&nbsp; This can lead to all sorts of problems if you have no experience with these types of problems. <br /><br />Do you like pimps!?! ;D&nbsp; If you are not already a pimp, and/or, have never even met an acknowledged pimp, you might not truly understand what you are in for. <br /><br />So how does one find a fun, open-minded, safe, party time girl?&nbsp; Are you sure that you are a fun, open-minded, safe, party time guy?&nbsp; Have you given you and your peer group long enough to &quot;prove&quot; that fact?&nbsp; Then no worries, live your life, and simply be cool enough to find that girl.<br /><br />At my age, I am more of the attitude that RabbitHabit has, even though she is female: I am self-confident enough that if someone wants to date me, they have to come with the coolness and then we go from there. But can one really &quot;fake&quot; being interesting, educated, or intelligent?&nbsp; The book thing can only be a conversation starter, but honestly, given Burroughs shot his wife dead, I really haven&#039;t ever met any females willing to talk about Burroughs at parties or clubs. Everyone I have ever spoke to about Burroughs has been male....&nbsp; I think you would have more of chance in picking up some random good looking female with some Hunter S. Thompson, but even there, Thompson is not high on the NY Times Chick Reads Book List.&nbsp; <br /><br />So this is my suggestion: If you are not already-- become a musician.&nbsp; Women who perform and enjoy watching and listening to the performance of live music are usually open-minded, moderately safe (herpes/tattoos/Hep C/Chalmedia :o), intelligent, and often beautiful physically as well.<br /><br />I would, finally, ask you to not capture or entomb any perspective girl friends in any under ground LSD party palace without their express consent, and the express consent of the National Football League, otherwise you might end up like either Rick James or far worse, Boy George!!!!<br /><br />Just my two cents,<br />DrunkenAfficianado 8)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

I&#039;ve met some great people and some terrible people who do psychedelics. The &quot;bad tripping partner&quot; (if not the &quot;bad first trip partner&quot;) is practically a rite of passage. As with any personality type, I think psychs just bring it out and make it impossible to ignore. Competitive types, control freaks (hey now it&#039;s time in the trip for us all to do THIS), passive aggressive types - they&#039;re all out there all the time. They just (mostly) know how to get along with people when they don&#039;t have a head full of shrooms. Or maybe it&#039;s that I can ignore those traits when I don&#039;t have a head full of shrooms. Probably both.<br /><br />I also didn&#039;t expect the thread to evolve the way it did, but that was because of the &quot;fantasy&quot; framing, rather than what I would tend to think of as heartfelt desire (I can fantasize about some things that in life would be rather undesirable). Mine: meeting someone who is experienced in a drug I&#039;ve never taken, so as we become involved she becomes my guide both to her and to the drug, in an intoxicating but indistinguishable mix. I freely admit that is fucked up. That&#039;s why it&#039;s just a fantasy. :)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Finding a girl to explore with would be a lot of fun, however everyone reacts to psych&#039;s differently. <br /><br />I think if part of your life is psychedelic experiences that&#039;s ok, its a part of mine =) but to make sure your significant other is ok with that part of your life. I spent 3-4 years dry, didnt touch anything but booze a few times and I felt mad, encased, and unable to express myself.<br /><br />For the past year I have started exploring again, even though my partner only shares interest with MDMA, they welcomly accept what I want to experience and support me. <br /><br />Anyways just my 2 cents.

				Following back over some of the recent posts, i can understand how being around people you are affectionate with may bring weird vibes, or uncomfortable feelings, but personally i have found a quick group blast off on DMT breaks the boundaries of humanity so blissfully.&nbsp; Than when LSD is dropped (and it has to be at least 200ug) you feel almost natural to lose control and flow with the LSD.&nbsp; Make sure some music is playing...those awkward silences will become so amazing trust me.<br /><br />IDK though, it is true.&nbsp; It can be very different for everybody, Just a night ago i had good clean acid but bad vibes and the love feeling was lacking.&nbsp; I know hat sounds weird because it was with my buddy, but it&#039;s more like the companionship.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be saving for burning man this summer, i hope it is all that it is cracked out to be...so i wanna source around a sheet or so and bring it there.... or should i just wait till i get there and source it there?

				Ok, stepping back into this thread to explicitly disavow what I said previously about psychs and bonding with fellow trippers. On shrooms, I stand by what I said - it&#039;s all honesty, writ large, with the people around you. But having recently branched out to some other psychs, I can definitely see how you could get caught up in the moment and lose your better judgment about someone (though why are you tripping with them, then?).<br /><br />Still searching for that psychonaut girlfriend...

				I suppose I should feel a bit guilty - I took a really hot psychonaut girl off the table by recently putting a ring on it. Adding insult to injury, we&#039;re both psychonaut ladies. Guess there&#039;s another reason besides the great weed to move out west huh... :P

				I started dating a girl who had never even tried smoking weed when she met me.&nbsp; Always thought drugs were awful.&nbsp; I actually met her through work so she knew I was a responsible young upstart at the time with a decent future.<br /><br />Our first date was a baseball game and I picked her up from work and took her back to my condo up in they sky overlooking the city so I could take a few bong rips before heading out to the game.&nbsp; I think the view kind of mesmerized her and she didn&#039;t seem to think twice about the smoking.<br /><br />After a few more dates, she tried weed but was not a fan at all.&nbsp; But she LOVED MDMA.&nbsp; And immediately after that was willing to experiment with anything I wanted.&nbsp; We went to WMC together many times and had awesome party weeks.&nbsp; And she has now tried with me LSD, mushrooms, mescaline, ayahuasca, and ketamine.&nbsp; She really still enjoys MDMA and psychedelics - not a fan of K however.&nbsp; We have been married for over three years now and I definitely feel like I picked the perfect one.&nbsp; She loves having sex on X for hours and this is the favorite thing in the world for me to do.<br /><br />We are getting older and as responsible people it&#039;s kind of ridiculous to think about tripping out every day for the rest of our lives.&nbsp; We do still have plenty of fun on occasions though and she is totally accepting of whatever I want to do with my other friends.<br /><br />So I guess my point in all of this is - you don&#039;t necessarily need to find someone that is already into drugs.&nbsp; If you can come off as a respectable guy who has his shit together - work on establishing the relationship with the woman first and just ensure she is open minded.&nbsp; Then, once you&#039;ve convinced her you&#039;re not some crazy nut job and have some career goals you can detail some of your interest in drugs.&nbsp; But I would also not recommend starting off with DMT or LSD.&nbsp; Consider either MDMA or a low dose of magic mushrooms.&nbsp; LSD can be shock to many people.&nbsp; MDMA just feels good and you are always likely to get the best reaction to that for the first experience IMO.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Female here, met my match on an online drug community 8 years ago. We have both slowed down a lot over the years (him more than me!) but we still find time to indulge in various things together when the time is right, and if he&#039;s not into doing something, he&#039;s quite supportive of me getting high with my best friends.

				While the Grand Wizard has been off the market for some time now, here are a few hints that might help:<br /><br />Bluelight is a great place to meet people. I&#039;ve seen quite a few relationships formed there.&nbsp; (Yes, I have a Bluelight account; no, it&#039;s not named &quot;Grand Wizard&quot; or anything similar; no, I&#039;m not going to give the name for reasons which should be obvious and no, I won&#039;t respond if you send a note saying &quot;So are you the Grand Wizard on SR?&quot;).<br /><br />Instead of looking for a psychonaut girlfriend, try looking for psychonaut friends of all ages, sexes, sexual orientations, etc.&nbsp; From there let romance develop organically.&nbsp; Looking for love is like grabbing water: the harder you try the more it slips through your finger.&nbsp; Relax, lay back and let it flow.&nbsp; I know lots of psychonauts of all preferences who would love to hook up with a smart and reasonably functional psychonaut but who find themselves surrounded by idiots and permanent residents of Dysfunction Junction. <br /><br />Note to Ramrugger: I am glad that you and your wife-to-be had an enjoyable NYE experience with the Wiz&#039;s 2c-b! Let me know the wedding date and I&#039;ll send the two of you a present.&nbsp; We&#039;re all about spreading the love at the Grand Wizard&#039;s Lair, and the world needs more happy couples.&nbsp;

I guess until then, at least you have us? :)<br /><br />and GWL, you are too kind. really. your product was top-notch (as was the service, duh) and I can&#039;t wait to order from you again. as for the date... I&#039;d like to know as much as you would. :P hopefully I&#039;ll have that answer soon!

That doesn&#039;t cut you out of hot kinky sex just because she&#039;s your friend.<br /><br />Eventually, we drifted apart because we couldn&#039;t afford each others use and started smoking alone. When she was out, i didn&#039;t call her. When i was out she didn&#039;t call me. I know it sounds shallow but it worked wonderfully. Then she left state in the hopes of quitting and i hope she&#039;s able to quit. I didn&#039;t see her showing signs of problems, but if she had to skip town because of it. Maybe, she was better at hiding it then i knew. Hopefully one day our paths shall cross again.<br /><br />Keep searching, you would be surprised who enjoys drugs as much as yourself. Normally the ones you can&#039;t tell use are the best because they have responsibilities and know how to keep their shit together. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yep this is my story except I&#039;m the girl. Best fun ever riding dirt bikes, mission buddy and laugh buddy all in one. Got complicated with a few things and I pulled away. Crazy thing he lives next door but we don&#039;t speak anymore to keep the peace with others. .. big convo&#039;s over many projects :( pipe buddy doomed from the start but so good while it lasted..

				yeah broski!!!!! i put like a pinch of some fine herb down first...like literally less than a bowl pack just enough to make small interference points to absorb the melting dmt.... put that shit on max and make sure the light goes off before you start the vaporization...have a good sized bag too cuz you wanna make sure you vape everything n 1 bag....oven bags are sufficient I&#039;ve found.... oh and make sure the dmt extract is FINELY crushed up....like do the paper and lighter trick to crush it up and a credit card to scrape it into powder...put id say about 70mg in that bitch and GL finishing the bag....nobody finishes the bag the first time they try the volcano....its like Neo in the matrix when he didn&#039;t make the jump....nobody finishes the bag on a volcano =P hahahah <br /><br /><br />if done correctly though the bag will INSTANTLY begin filling with deep white vape....like a nice chalky vape...that smells QUITE peculiar lol...oh and it reduces the stink of DMT by like 100%....u just have to wash your&nbsp; vape equipment out with rubbing alcohol every once n a while to keep from blasting off when yer just trying to get high =P

				This is why I never take my girlfriend for granted. She loves sex and she loves drugs. It works. Of course, there&#039;s some negatives but that&#039;s where having a real connection comes into play making it a pretty well balanced relationship. What really made me realize how good it is to have a girl who is also into drugs was when my weed dealer said &quot;You have a stoner girl? You&#039;re lucky. Keep her close.&quot; I am lucky. I keep her close.

				Go to&nbsp; jamband shows/festivals or clubs that have those types of bands. Always have ectra on hand to share with a couple of her friends as well. LSD horrifies some people for some reason so the soft sell is a good approach unless she is a wook.<br /><br />As long as she handles her drugs, having a chick who takes psyches is fun. Be wary tho, I spent a year with boozy blow xanax mdma recreational habit &amp; it was an expensive drama.

				Rest assured, gents, they&#039;re out there. <br /><br />One of my best friends is a SINGLE, mid-twenties, female with 3 degrees and a 6-figure income. She has done just about every drug I can think of off the top of my head and has found her favorites to be LSD, coke, and DMT. She actually only one of a few female psychnauts I know, but the only single one. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried any psychs. I want to and plan on trying LSD and DMT. I have been too self conscious and afraid of how it will effect me. I like party drugs (Molly, coke) bc I still have control of myself. Maybe some of the females you suspect are anti-drug&quot; but are actually just self-conscious and worried bout losing control. If she is an pen-minded female then you shouldn&#039;t be too worried about bringing it up to her. <br /><br />Back in my single, drinking days I think I would have tried a psych if a guy I knew approached me with knowledge of the drug he was offering and I was in a comfortable environment (my place). That never happened :(<br /><br />I would be very curious about a guy reading Hunter S Thompson in a coffee shop.<br /><br />A stoner girl is BONUS! Speaking from my own personal experience with weed: I am 10x more pleasant to be around during a certain time of the month.
