				Thanks guys, interesting stuff.... <br /><br />Another question though, how much is the commission on sales? Presumably it&#039;s flat rate percentage?<br />I see that a vendor can choose to list items priced as pre-commission or post-commission, but I&#039;m wondering what the actual rates are. Does it vary by category, price, etc?

Here&#039;s an example from DPR&#039;s State of the Road Address:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.msg76738#msg76738">Quote from: State of the Road Address on January 09, 2012, 03:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.&nbsp; The average response looked like this:<br /><br />15% of the first $10<br />11% of $10 - $50<br />8.14% of $50 - $250<br />5.6% of $250 - $1000<br />3.7% of $1000 - $5000<br /><br />We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:<br /><br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So taking DPR&#039;s fee scale, here is how a sale is broken down:<br /><br />In a $300 sale, for example:<br /><br />$50 is charged at 10% of the first $50, so $5 fee.<br />$100 is charged at 8.5% of the next $50 - $100, so $8.50 fee.<br />$150 is charged at 6% of the final $150 - $300, so $9 fee.<br /><br />Total: $300.<br />Total commission: $22.50<br />Total paid to vendor for item: $277.50<br />Total paid to vendor for item, if hedging order (@ 4% hedging fee): $266.40<br /><br /><br />In a $1016 sale, for example:<br /><br />$50 is charged at 10% from the $0 - $50 point, so $5 fee.<br />$100 is charged at 8.5% from the $50 - $100 point, so $8.50 fee.<br />$150 is charged at 6% from the $150 - $300 point, so $9 fee.<br />$200 is charged at 3% from the $300 - $500 point, so $6 fee.<br />$500 is charged at 2% from the $500 - $1000 point, so $10 fee.<br />$16 is charged at 1.5% from the $1000 and up point, so $0.24 fee.<br /><br />Total: $1016.<br />Total commission: $38.74<br />Total paid to vendor for item: $977.26<br />Total paid to vendor for item, if hedging order (@ 4% hedging fee): $938.17<br /><br /><br />You may also be interested in the post I wrote in response to a question asked by Bungee54 about pre-commission and post-commission pricing. That post explains how much you get if you choose pre-commission, how much you get if you choose post-commission, how much you get if you decide to hedge, and what the customer will actually see on the listing itself depending on the option you choose.<br />You can find that post here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=37765.msg429683#msg429683<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />One more thing to note is that fees are not charged on shipping costs.<br /><br />Libertas

				You must pay the bond. It is only returnable once you have completed over $1500 USD in sales and have been a vendor for more than 6 weeks.<br /><br />No you can not have a vendor account fronted to you.

				Shame.

				If you&#039;re an honest person with access to quantities of illegal drugs or other items that you think will sell succesfully on SR then you probably also have access to 500$ to put up as bond.<br /><br />I truly believe the $500 fee is a great deterrent of scammers.<br /><br />I am&nbsp; by no means a bulk seller of any kind and was able to afford the 500$ vendor fee no problem. I&#039;ve also well paid it off and in 15 days I will receive my bond back.

It&#039;s important to do financial projections to include the worst case scenario before becoming a vendor and to factor in the fact that money may be tied up for 20+ days before you will be paid.<br /><br />You seem like a person that is very interested in your security arrangements etc., so if you do decide to become a vendor I wish you the very best of luck with it! :)<br /><br />Libertas

Better start saving those pennies. lol<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Requesting that buyers FE is not permitted until a vendor has made 35+ actual transactions and been a member for 1 month+. It&#039;s important to do financial projections to include the worst case scenario before becoming a vendor and to factor in the fact that money may be tied up for 20+ days before you will be paid.<br /><br />You seem like a person that is very interested in your security arrangements etc., so if you do decide to become a vendor I wish you the very best of luck with it! :)<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Cheers fella. Yeah, watch this space. :)

				I incorrectly assumed the bond was fixed in BTC as I had checked it two days in a row and it was the same.<br />Practically for me it takes up to a week between dumping cash into the system and it coming up in SR.<br />So with the recent drop in dollar value I am short of BTC for the vendor bond. Looks like I&#039;m going to have to wait out until the exchange rates level out a bit.<br /><br />So a question for current vendors - are you hedging funds or not? What way do you find is the best or ends up financially better off?
