				I&#039;m a new vendor too but I&#039;ve finally established myself. What I did was start out with free samples but try to send it to reputable members but don&#039;t let post count fool, the way they ask should tell you whether they are there to nab a free sample or actually want to review it. I also suggest keeping your shipping methods completely secret, your customers will do the same (hopefully). Start a thread in the rumor mill so that customers can review your products all in the same place and that&#039;s pretty much how you start.

				It&#039;s hard to stand out when you&#039;re new, giving out free samples for review and feedback is probably the best way to get noticed. Giving out freebies will give you a start, but good service and communication are what counts in the long run.

				giving out samples will build up your feedback and let consumers know that product is high quality and legit.<br /><br />Interested in getting a sample. Will leave you some good feedback.<br /><br />Also some sellers are doing lotteries haha but&nbsp; samples are better.

				Free samples or reduced price samples are a fantastic way to establish a good reputation for new vendors. Galindoi, one of my absolute favorite vendors, began his &quot;SR career&quot; by sending out 100 free samples of 10g encapsulated sclerotia on a first come first serve basis. The only cost to buyers was a three dollar shipping fee. What established him as a reputable and reliable vendor was not only giving out free samples but also shipping out quality product that arrived promptly and discreetly. Within a week of creating his account, a massive amount of positive feedback and successful transactions began pouring in. <br /><br />In my opinion, if you wanted to build up a good reputation, calculate how much of your product you can afford to offer as samples. Then fulfill all sample orders and regular orders in a discreet and timely fashion. I feel like this is a very effective way of building up a good reputation in a short period of time!!

				I would recommend around five samples, depending on how much each will cost you. If you cant do free, just offer at cost for you or a free gift (like a little extra), anything to spark some interest given your lack of feedback.<br /><br />Do more than 100 mg, since with most mdma this is not a full dose and you dont want to leave people thinking your product is not potent from the start just cause they didnt do a full dose, but 500 mg is way more than necessary. I would say around 125 or 150 mg which is usually enough pure mdma for a great roll. <br /><br />The most important thing if you charge anything to start off with, is do it within escrow! Requiring finalizing early is a sure way to alienate people initially

If you don&#039;t think you can afford a few 150mg samples, then charge a small amount for each one. But don&#039;t send 100mg, as that&#039;s the threshold for a decent roll, and if any of your samplers has a tolerance to MDMA (and one or more probably will), you don&#039;t want reviews that claim your product is weak.<br /><br />I&#039;d be happy to test your product, but I have a high tolerance and 150mg wouldn&#039;t get me rolling hard, so I don&#039;t think I would be an appropriate judge. In any case, best of luck!
