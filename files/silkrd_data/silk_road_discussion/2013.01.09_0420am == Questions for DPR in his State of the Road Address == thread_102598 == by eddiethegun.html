				It&#039;s been exactly one year since DPR&#039;s last State of the Road Address (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.0) so presumably the 2013 Address should be happening soon. I figured we&#039;d kick off a thread to send some questions to DPR and maybe he&#039;ll answer a few.<br /><br />I&#039;ll start:<br /><br />There was a big outage in November and the SR QuickBuy image hack in December. What&#039;s going on with security? What, if anything, was compromised in those attacks?<br /><br />Some minor changes have been made to the market (Report an item/vendor links, raised vendor account prices then made &quot;bond&quot;)... What sort of changes are next on the agenda?<br /><br />

				Algorithms- We&#039;re talking about tens of thousands, if not millions of years to break into these algorithms<br /><br />So for a small piece of data we have the traditional problem where if you spend more effort trying to break into an encrypted piece of data, then by the time you&#039;ve successfully broken into the data, the data itself has no value.

				I have a question (or two):<br /><br />If the road reaches a river, can you bridge it?<br />If the road passes through fire, can you shield it from the heat?<br />If the road crumbles, can it be rebuilt?<br />If the road ever reaches a dead end, will there be hope of an extension reaching to new horizons?<br />If the road meets a fork, will there be a sign to show the way?<br />If the road becomes dangerous, can sanctuary be found along it&#039;s path?<br />If the road becomes impassable, when again will traversal be possible?<br />If the road becomes a highway, will the bright lights blind us?<br />If the road leads down a dark path, will there be lights to guide us?<br />If the road is tormented by malevolent beings, will there be knights to slay them?<br /><br />finally,<br />Is the road a steeper gradient to our hellish destination? Or will it allow us a path to climb out of the self-reinforcing, for-gone conclusion of ultimate human demise and misery?<br />

Not easily, and not without a strong backing. DPR/tor/BTC deserves credit for this long.<br />2. Likely, a better attempt by dragons would include providing DPR to the dutch indoes Co or the Navy.<br />3. Who? HOW? we know the why. Again, yes. but it would take a of trusted and loyal team. And everyone keeping their traps shut.<br />4.some of these are redundant. whilst i applaud DPR. and the model and expectations that have been set this far cant be replaced from oen day to the next. unless someone has a contigency plan. not an easy thing. <br /><br />nobody freak out. my tin foil hat make me a hipster.<br /><br />girls like hipster?<br /><br />and they ask why i do drugs. O.o
