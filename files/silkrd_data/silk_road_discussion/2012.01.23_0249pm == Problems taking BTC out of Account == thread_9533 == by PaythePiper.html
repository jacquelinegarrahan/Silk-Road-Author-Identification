				Has anyone been able to withdraw BTC from their account on here within the last 12 hours?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been seriously trying for the past 12 hours and it just take me to a blank screen and my BTC are still in my account.<br /><br />Or am I the only one?

				Evidently Silk Road is taking the day off from processing BTC transactions because I&#039;ve got a deposit that I&#039;ve been waiting 9+ hours for. Check the help forum too, looks like it&#039;s messed up for everyone.

				I made a withdrawal request on the 21st, still nothing. I&#039;ve contacted support, no response but they did respond to something else afterwards that wasn&#039;t related.<br /><br />There is obviously an issue at the moment.

				More than a few! One of the listings I was looking at is gone, now! <br />Also, I had deposited from another wallet at the same time as the one I am now waiting 16+ hours for. Why would one deposit make it in, and the other not? very strange

				Hrmm... I don&#039;t understand why the admins/mods don&#039;t comment on the forum anymore.. It&#039;s kind of hard to feel comfortable leaving so much money in escrow and on SR and ship products out when we don&#039;t even know, as vendors, if we will get paid on time for what we send out since the site is always having problems

				Just for the record me too - I need my money!! If it&#039;s fixed now, this means another full 24hrs before I&#039;ll have cash.<br /><br />To the admins: THANKS for the quality service, guess this is what we pay $150 and %10 of profit for??<br /><br />Good business practice would be to cut us vendors a $ break or a credit, I&#039;m gonna have to borrow money to cover this lag.. :(

				As did I. I imagine SR is FLOODED with messages about this. I wouldn&#039;t expect a reply. <br />I feel for all you vendors who needed to re-up. <br />I have one vendor who has offered me an awesome deal, and I have been waiting almost 24 hours, now. Fortunately,I don&#039;t have as much caught up as others! Vendor was kind enough to hold the deal until this problem is abolished. <br />As for the downtime, as I am learning, SR is still in its infancy. Burps are to be expected. I am sure SR will post sooner or later and apologize.<br /><br />

				seems like i noticed this bug started happening about a week or two ago. i had to contact SR twice about getting the error and the first time it happened to me i had the coins deducted from my account with the error message and for whatever reason they never made it to my bitcoin wallet. SR eventually re-credited my account. i was able to make 3 or four successful withdrawals after that and now the bug is back, but at least now its not deducting the coins from my account. hopefully they are working on the problem right now. as a vendor i am bombarded with sellers and know what its like to have to take the time to go through each message and respond to it. the admins of SR probably have it 10x worse as they also have to work out site bugs on top of noobs and others who need help using the site.
