				I just thought of this great idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;Coupons for vendors. <br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s a great incentive to buy an increase sales and it&#039;s so cheap and easy to do.<br /><br />I think it could be done all electronic posting the coupons in the forums and redeeming them upon placing the order.<br /><br />If vendors want to increase sales this is a cheap and easy way to do it.<br />Of course in the marketing business coupons are used to unload extra product.&nbsp; So you wouldn&#039;t use coupons if you are a successful product.&nbsp; Slow sales and surplus product is the best application for coupons.<br /><br />So somebody should start a new sticky in the forums just for coupons.&nbsp; &nbsp;So before you buy you check out the thread of coupons and redeem your coupons when you buy.&nbsp; <br /><br />

If a vendor needs to create gift codes in order to make sales, either his or her prices are too high, or they are offering a product for which there is little to no demand. They may increase sales, but using gift codes (coupons) will decrease their profit margin making the entire process of selling a bit pointless in the first place.<br /><br />I agree with you about a thread for gift codes, perhaps that is a good idea, and you are of course free to start one. There would be no need for it to be stickied as any gift codes posted on the site are usually claimed within minutes.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I&#039;ve never seen a gift code in the whole time I&#039;ve been here .&nbsp; I read the forums every day.&nbsp; Where do they market these things? On vendor pages?&nbsp; <br /><br />Like you say they get scooped up right away.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m proposing disposable coupons that are always available . They don&#039;t run out.&nbsp; It&#039;s a chance for the buyer to get more value.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t much given back to the customer in This marketplace .&nbsp; It&#039;s a sellers market . <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;It doesn&#039;t hurt sales at all if you can get a customer to buy more of a product.&nbsp; Buy 3 get one free. A person would never buy 3 to begin with. But a coupon might be the deciding factor to buying 3 instead of 1 .<br /><br />With the extra sales the cost of Giving stuff away is absorbed by the extra sales.&nbsp; It&#039;s all in the economics text book.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about using coupons or hell why not even these Elusive gift codes to market a vendor.&nbsp; To get the vendor name in the Mind of the buyer who is loyal to a few vendors.&nbsp; It&#039;s an incentive to shop around and try out new or different vendors.<br /><br />This is much bigger than just gift codes . Gift codes are so backwards marketing and you can tell a programmer thought of it.&nbsp; Hell the name is shit too.&nbsp; Gifts.&nbsp; &nbsp;No wonder vendors rarely use them.&nbsp; It sounds ls they are giving away stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp; Coupons are different ,&nbsp; they motivate people to try out a different brand or to buy more of a product&nbsp; &nbsp;They are not gifts.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ive read a few posts from new vendors asking why nobody is buying from them.&nbsp; few vendors whose sales are dragging and new vendors can&#039;t sell due to their new reputation .&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s easy cheap and effective marketing.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to see one of these gift codes someday .&nbsp; &nbsp;Message me when you see&nbsp; one to prove they exist or are being used effectively .&nbsp; &nbsp;They are gifts .&nbsp; That&#039;s why they run out so quickly.&nbsp; They are not utilized properly at all.<br /><br />As I said coupons are only used to unload surplus product and raise flatulent sales. .&nbsp; If it ain&#039;t broke don&#039;t fix it.&nbsp; Some product just sell themselves&nbsp; and would never need coupons.<br /><br />But I tell you with so many competing vendors selling the same products , what makes a person choose one vendor over another might be a coupon or gift code.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s a chance for a vendor to market&nbsp; themselves as well.&nbsp; Get their Name out there in a forum thread titled free shit .&nbsp; Who isn&#039;t too going to read that Kind of thread - to see the daily deals and specials before buying.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m thinking of flyers and catalogs you get in the mail.&nbsp; I know I&#039;d like to&nbsp; be notified if a vendor has a special deal .&nbsp; Like you say about gift codes .&nbsp; They run out fast.&nbsp; &nbsp;Flyers and coupons are forever and always available to help customers make an informed choice of where to buy from.&nbsp; Gift codes don&#039;t do this .&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact they do nothi g for marketing at all.&nbsp; Where do&nbsp; you find them.?&nbsp; &nbsp;On a vendor page that nobody would check out to begin with ?&nbsp; Every key has their loyal favorite vendors .&nbsp; Getting people to try new vendor<br /><br />Incentive to buy .&nbsp; &nbsp;Vendors don&#039;t loose any profits and they got lots to Gain with buyers shopping around.&nbsp; What would it take to get someone to buy from a beginner vendor or switch vendors for their favorite product.&nbsp; A coupon or flyer or even a rare gift code.<br /><br />I&#039;m not arguing .&nbsp; I&#039;m glad you Brought up the gift codes.&nbsp; I forgot all about them.&nbsp; I think vendors need a lesson o. How to use gift codes effectively and frequently to promote themselves.&nbsp; I know I&#039;d abandon my usual vendor to try out a different one who is selling my favorite gear and offering some sort of incentive to buy more and get a deal of the day.<br /><br />A lot of people in these forums are very negative and anti-fun.&nbsp;
