				Has anyone received their order that has ordered from November -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --- I still have faith for some reason my package will come, but it seems as if something either A happend to him or B he vanished with a lot of peoples&#039; money. I still have faith, because all the complaints are coming from shipping.<br /><br /><br />I just don&#039;t understand how a package can take on average 16+ days when its a US address shipping to a US address. Doesn&#039;t make any sense. I mean what shipping options are there that take THAT LONG, so he has to be forcing people to FE and getting money in advance, then putting it in transit, but not actually shipping it till later..WAY LATER. I mean that&#039;s my thought. OR hes maybe scamming some people, half assing others and then being legit to many. <br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t know what to think, but I would like some help here.

				I&#039;m pretty sure I was scammed by The Farmacy. I ordered on October 27th and still haven&#039;t received anything or even heard from him. It&#039;s too bad, his nugs looked great. I hope he is not a scumbag and i hear from him soon.

				I ordered from him over a month ago as well, and so far nothing. I&#039;m hesitant to blow up his spot and call scammer here on the forum, but at this point, there doesn&#039;t seem to be any other way to call it. I&#039;ve sent him a couple messages about it. At first he responded, telling me he checked the DCN and that the package would be arriving within the week. Except that was 27 days ago, lol, so either he was lying or USPS fucked up somehow. I sent him two more messages which have gone unanswered, and a third just now, wherein I tried to appeal to his ~emotions to see if that might get a response out of him haha. At this point, there isn&#039;t much else I can do but cut my losses, move on and take it as a lesson to never FE again. Although, that&#039;s a little easier for me say that, I suppose. I&#039;ve seen your posts elsewhere on here, and it seems you had quite a bit more coin at stake than I did. I&#039;m sorry, man. Maybe he&#039;ll hit me back with a response and let me know what&#039;s up or at least consider a partial refund. I&#039;ll let you know.<br /><br />At any rate, I hope any new potential buyers are checking the forums before they place an order with him, though -- at least until this all gets straightened out or he makes a case for himself.

				Add me to the scam list.&nbsp; Maybe she is having trouble IRL or has too much business, but she still responds to order requests and signs on daily.&nbsp; Without coming on to explain or any attempt to make things right, there is no other conclusion.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see her in hell.<br /><br />I&#039;m not blaming anyone else - I know it&#039;s bad to FE, I new this vendor had a &quot;requirement&quot; to FE - definitely my fault.&nbsp; It won&#039;t happen again.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I surely do not understand why SR allows vendors to require FE - even if they have good vendor stats with domestic buyers with good stats.&nbsp; Vendors who require FE should be banned.&nbsp; Asking is one thing - making it a requirement is quite another.&nbsp; This practice needs to be reviewed.&nbsp; &gt;:(
