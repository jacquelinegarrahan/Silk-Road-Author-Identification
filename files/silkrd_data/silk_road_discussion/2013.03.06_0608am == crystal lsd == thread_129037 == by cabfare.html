				I&#039;m no chemist, but I think denatured alcohol is the answer here. Probably wrong, but I&#039;ve read about denatured alcohol in that process somewhere, I think. I&#039;m sure somebody here knows a WHOLE lot more than I do.

				I&#039;m hoping you&#039;re just curious and don&#039;t actually have some amount of crystal while having no idea what to do with it, but if not feel free to PM me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll give advice all day in return for any visible amount of crystal :)<br /><br />Denatured alcohol is ethanol w/ additives that make it taste like ass and make you nauseous, so you wouldn&#039;t use that.&nbsp; Vials and blotter are generally put into different types of solution.&nbsp; Vials usually go into distilled or HPLC-grade water, as it doesn&#039;t evaporate as fast as alcohol (which would leave you w/ unnecessarily potent drops towards the end of the vial).&nbsp; Tap water contains chlorine which destroys LSD, so don&#039;t chance using that.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always wondered if anyone uses vegetable glycerine or propylene glycol, but have never heard of or seen anyone doing it.&nbsp; I figure one of these days I&#039;m gonna find a kid w/ some 25i in VG/PG solution to mask the horrific taste.<br /><br />A lot of people prefer 1dram (approx 3ml) glass dropper vials, but I&#039;m a bigger fan of sweet breath bottles.&nbsp; They&#039;re more incognito, and you&#039;re not gonna have a glass bottle shatter in your pocket and cut your leg.&nbsp; That&#039;d be one interesting trip to the emergency room if by some chance it actually cut you bad enough to require stitches :)&nbsp; For distilled water, most standard 1 dram glass vials need 1.5ml to get 100 drops out of them.&nbsp; Usually you&#039;ll end up w/ 10ish drops that need to be washed out though.<br /><br />Laying sheets is a completely different ballgame, and more of an art form IMO.&nbsp; Don&#039;t really feel like getting too into that, but anyone is welcome to contact me w/ questions.&nbsp; Don&#039;t just buy a random piece of 140 watercolor at an art store, cut a 2.5in square, draw 18 even lines, and then drop them by hand.&nbsp; You&#039;ll end up w/ a horrible uneven sheet, just drop that shit in people&#039;s mouths.&nbsp; Also, distilled water by itself is not ideal as it doesn&#039;t dry fast enough to keep everything even.&nbsp; When people lay sheets, they&#039;re dipping them in a solution they&#039;ve made and generally doing 100 of them (1g of crystal if you want standard 100ug doses) at a time.
