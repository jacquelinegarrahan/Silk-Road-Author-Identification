				Yep. I imagine it has to do with it being 4/20, traffic must be a lot higher than usual today. But then again, I know absolutely nothing about the technical workings of the inter-net.

				I would mind it more if there were lots of special sales today.&nbsp; &nbsp; However, it seems like most vendors are just business as usual on this HOLIDAY lol.<br /><br />

				LOL @ fallkniven <br />Slow motion jiggling is all I can think of.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It is painfully slow that&#039;s for sure....and that&#039;s without the promotions and giveaways like last year.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully the site will pick up the pace.<br /><br />Respect

				Don&#039;t you talk about my tits that way. <br /><br />But seriously. 4/20 + a Saturday at prime Europe evening and afternoon in the U.S. = slow Road. I just hope it lets me on long enough to get some of those $1 edibles from Hightimes.&nbsp; :-*

				I remember there being a thread announcing the greatness that this day will bring (sales! prizes!), but given the headache of the waits, the timeouts, i&#039;m not so sure it&#039;s worth ordering today at all. I&#039;m a nervous, chronically refreshing wreck.

				The thread about sales &amp; prizes was most likely LAST YEARS thread that got bumped because somebody posted in it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know some vendors that have some special offerings but this year 420 is not a special day on the road per DPR like it was last year.&nbsp; &nbsp; The giveaways and prizes were nice and alot of fun but the scamming that went on was not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sigh.&nbsp; &nbsp; And like someone said before....you don&#039;t buy your christmas presents on Christmas day anyways right?
