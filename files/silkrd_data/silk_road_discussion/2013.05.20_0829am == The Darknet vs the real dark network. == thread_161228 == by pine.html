				If those that protest politically against this fiendish war are true in their conviction they should come here, to this forum, and say so, and in saying so STAND by their words. <br /><br />Else what are we to think of those who protest in the abstract yet lack when faced with the concrete, the actual realization of their aspiration?<br /><br />By some counts, the Silk Road and the other Darknet markets are the most successful drug related social experiment in close to a century. Even have them taken down forever and that cannot not change this basic truth. <br /><br />Some of you might consider that hyperbole but this is why; consider what the government drolly labels Continuing Criminal Enterprise. I have examined many of those networks, and I can tell you that even the least excessive and most honorable ones such as the Japanese Mafia are responsible for the deaths of many people. Executions are as regular as clockwork, it becomes like taking out the trash to enforcers.<br /><br />We are all, the most fierce DEA agents included, pragmatists when it comes to legal drugs for medicinal purposes. We know that every year, at a minimum thousands of people die from drugs that are legal, pure, and taken correctly. We accept this in the same way that we implicitly give license to coal mining, even though when thinking about it for two seconds it is realized that many hundreds of coal miners must go to their deaths throughout the world and even with the best safety practices in the United States the number hardly strays from double digits per year and in fact three and four digits was the norm until relatively recently.<br /><br />Whether recreational/non-medicinal use of drugs is as advantageous as electric power for hundreds of millions of people is beside the point. There is a tradeoff. An socioeconomic calculation. There is a bargain society makes in all kinds of areas for which the sacrifice is human life.<br /><br />We know, absolutely, that the Silk Road cannot have directly murdered competition as is the norm with offline drug networks. We don&#039;t think it is true, we know it to be true because it isn&#039;t even theoretically possible save under exceptional circumstances, and even then it is unlikely. Unless a vendor already knew another vendor from previous experience, they cannot have known each other *because of the Silk Road*. The staff of the Darknet markets could only find out the real identities of other competing marketplaces if they have been intercepted by law enforcement. The nature of anonymous marketplaces must have already prevented coercion that otherwise would have taken place. Competition becomes capitalist, about market share, not biological competition over geography in which the survival of the fittest is the real determinant of market share. <br /><br />Few drug dealers (outside of Mexico) live in fear of their lives because of government agents, even though they are hardly killed by them infrequently. No, by far the main cause of violence is a medieval honor system where &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;territory&quot; lead to positive feedback loops that only terminate when &quot;enough&quot; testosterone powered young men have been sacrificed or mutilated. It should not be found provocative in the least that some Mexicans worship Jesus Malverde, a drug dealer, as a saint, since anybody rational comes to the conclusion there is something of a Aztec quality to the entire Drug War, whether it is drug dealers vs government agents or drug dealers vs other drug dealers, it&#039;s men with guns killing other men with guns. Praying to Malverde is... lucid in comparison to the Democrat and Republican hand wringing that goes on.<br /><br />That is not to suggest there are no problems with the Silk Road&#039;s business model that could cause harm. For example drug impurities. Or simply children ordering something with a high level of toxicity. And these sorts of problems could be silent but real because if it goes horribly wrong it&#039;s an event unlikely to lead to negative feedback of any sort. However it may revolt the DEA, these problems are much closer to the coal mining or allergic drug reaction trade offs than they are of gang-bangers shooting up entire neighborhoods and contributing to the decay of whole zip codes.<br /><br />Ultimately, since this is a very new concept, we shall see the development of 3rd party quality assurance mechanisms, even possibly age validation and discrimination. The majority of Silk Road vendors and staff are keenly aware that for both ethical and financial reasons some regulatory methods are necessary to reduce harm. The attempts to develop these are still in nascent form, feedback threads and scores, but it is a start where before there was empty space.<br /><br />Ryan Haight died in 2001 with IOP supplied Vicodin being the cause of death. The result, the Ryan Haight Act, was put into law with the stated intention of preventing other teenagers from obtaining drugs without prescription. Regardless of how you feel about the Silk Road, the Ryan Haight Act had failed to accomplish its objective long before the Silk Road came into existence.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that both SR and LE people remember The Dark Knight since it was such an interesting movie and raised genuine moral dilemmas for us to take home. It may seem bizarre that I quote it in this context,&nbsp; but I think it&#039;s actually quite appropriate.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Joker: Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I&#039;m a dog chasing cars. I wouldn&#039;t know what to do with one if I caught it. You know, I just... do things. The mob has plans, the cops have plans, Gordon&#039;s got plans. You know, they&#039;re schemers. Schemers trying to control their little worlds. I&#039;m not a schemer. I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So, when I say... Ah, come here.<br /><br />(He takes Dent&#039;s hand into his own)<br /><br />Joker: When I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know that I&#039;m telling the truth. It&#039;s the schemers that put you where you are. You were a schemer, you had plans, and look where that got you.<br /><br />(Dent tries to grab the Joker.)<br /><br />Joker: I just did what I do best. I took your little plan and I turned it on itself. Look what I did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets. Hmmm? You know... You know what I&#039;ve noticed? Nobody panics when things go &quot;according to plan.&quot; Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it&#039;s all &quot;part of the plan.&quot; But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The reason why this moment resonates with us, is because we know it to be true. The Plan is horrible.<br /><br />What are we, you going to do? Stand there with the status quo? Make wishy-washy liberal arguments about legalizing marijuana as if black markets for alcohol and tobacco somehow don&#039;t exist? It is not adequate. Make the conservative argument that for reasons of social dysfunction, morality basically, that the greater good is served by caging well over a million people? Well by my count at least 7 million family members suffer as a result, the individual in question, then the mothers, grandmothers, fathers, grandfathers, to say nothing of siblings. That&#039;s not adequate either.<br /><br />Now that the system exists, it perpetuates itself regardless of the original logic. So far as I can see, the Silk Road is the only genuine answer that contains both economic and moral parameters. Capitalism is far from utopian, there are people in my own family with serious legal drug dependencies but let&#039;s work with this new possibility instead of these tired liberal and conservative memes that have flailed around for decades and got nowhere. My contribution, admittedly very tiny is PGP Club, what I want to ask you is: What is yours? <br /><br />I would like all kinds of people to come to SR; drug war antagonists or supporters, and explain precisely why you support or abhor the Silk Road and what you are doing about it. Because being an armchair general, which is what a lot of conservatives and liberals amount to, simply doesn&#039;t rate. That is tantamount to tacitly accepting the Drug War death cult, a nihilistic philosophy if there ever was one.<br /><br />--

				Great Post...&nbsp; reading your post pine: has given me good perspective on exactly what i think i am involved in.&nbsp; I had no interest, nor did i see deep importance to concepts like cryptoanarchy, prior to some of your past posts. <br /><br />drugs attract most of us here -including me.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure like me, others see this as a true outlet to express freedom and ultimately practice humanity.&nbsp; History is fucked, most in power today are there because of some type of prohibition -all the way back to corporate entities like east india company..&nbsp; they are the extension of todays policies -and absolutely not just drug policy.<br /><br />that joker quote makes me want to watch the dark knight again, it&#039;s sooo real.&nbsp; Those who point the finger at us are the ultimate hypocrites; and in my opinion without soul; for how can they still not realize what they do?&nbsp; I see/seen first hand what the drug war does, it empowers and privilege a particular social meme dubbed LAW ENFORCEMENT who absolutely don&#039;t deserve entitlement nor special respect.&nbsp; The drug war is completely about dividing the people, it allows one to practice the art of bias.&nbsp;

				Yet another great, well thought out post Pine. Like my Personal quote says, i came for the drugs but once i came to the forums i enjoyed that even more so than the marketplace. Every branch of LE is a faction of a rival gang, if they were treated as such, the drug war would be virtually non-existent. <br /><br />Most of us know that some psychedelics could even solve the worlds problems and yet ask any member of LE they&#039;ll lie right to your face about everything, im not even sure its really &#039;lying&#039; anymore because they are so brainwashed themselves that they forgot how to think and come up with an original thought on their own. <br /><br />I think that SR and online black markets will eventually over take the current drug distribution method. If there is even a war on drugs to speak of in the distant future.<br />

				Pine, you have vision.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for bringing the awesome clarity.&nbsp; We are figuring out technical solutions to old problems.&nbsp; So much intentional waste goes into sacrifice, with some good thought and engineering new paths will be taken simply for their enhanced efficiency.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are almost there.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I appreciate the new ideas coming forward, whether it is the 3rd party quality control(avengers of {LSD,MDMA,Cannabis,XYZ}) or monkeysphere/pgp-centrality for autonomous discrimination.&nbsp; In my little corner of the world, this screams utopia.<br /><br />~<br /><br />

				The whole spectrum of the argument is segmented like the spokes of a wheel. You have so many multi-factorial implications within the war between&nbsp; entities such as:<br /><br />-The offline/online drug market (seen as the Devil);<br />-LE (seen as some kind of unsullied army of justice and correction);<br />-The common public (the people funding either side, it is their money that decides the fate of any political/legal war in a democracy)<br />-Politicians (people paid to lie to and groom the public)<br />-Any sort of political head honcho (PM, President)<br /><br />We can create a bigger infantry and more powerful machine that can overwhelm the resources of LE, but that in no way creates an atmosphere that would ever allow us to relax and continue to do our errands in peace. <br /><br />Conquests between empires.<br /><br />But in the middle, in between us and basically the whole world of systematic control, is the common public that makes or breaks whatever is decided to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. No matter how we try to justify what it is we do, the world will always bow down to what has been and what always will be (maybe instilled institutionally by religion or by controlled doctrines by alternate agendas of deeper, more secret societies, thats more for conspiracy theorists to masturbate over) perceived as a greater good, and a protector of the people (the fucking police). This, for whatever reason, will. never change. It&#039;s a depressing absolute, but it is an absolute nonetheless. Until the bigger part of the Western society is somehow laid under a tyrant yoke with a fierce and merciless dictatorship, the police and the &quot;government&quot; will always been received as welcome help (unless you&#039;re living in the projects, lol).<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree, I consider the whole legal force to be backwards, with nothing but arbitrary laws that are only enforced and twisted into loopholes to suit whatever point it is the police or federal government is trying to prove.... For this, I despise most police forces. Individuals can be singled out and held at a higher regard, but as a group, with their own fucked up leadership, they become a pack of assholes, with no real moral code.<br /><br />HOWEVER, it is a force that will always find a way to weasel it&#039;s way into the wallets and purses of the public, by government propaganda, campaigns dressed up as something nice, that overall funnels money into fighting a war with people that really just want to buy and sell some drugs to make people happy and make some cash. (Mexican strong-armed criminals obviously not included in this analogy).<br /><br />These posts are important, I guess, for people to bounce ideas off of each other and try to open their minds and learn new ways to go about their business in a way that, in the long run, will allow for them to shop and retail in peace, if they play it clever. It won&#039;t then be a market presence that is totally ANARKIST IN DA POLICEZ FACE YO FUCK U LOL!!11, it will be a peaceful and flourishing market full of anonymous buyers that can conduct their business without risk or harm.<br /><br />SR is a god-send place for this, it takes out all the risks that IRL drug-marketing involves (violence, extortion, bullying, slavery), and allows people to just buy shit and have some fun and make some money.<br /><br />TL;DR, buy drugs and get high.

Bravo! And I just want to state that PGP Club is most certainly NOT a &quot;small&quot; contribution. By encouraging and teaching others how to safely use PGP to protect themselves from the nanny-state you are empowering them in their fight against it. Even if they have no desire to change the system, the knowledge that suddenly their communications can&#039;t be intercepted by government agents will start a fire burning inside them. The longer they stay here, the more they integrate into this community, the hotter that fire will begin to burn.<br /><br />Your contribution is a huge one, and you shouldn&#039;t be so modest about it. Many here - in fact saying 60%+ probably wouldn&#039;t be far off - owe their knowledge of PGP to you and the other members of the Club you set up. You encourage those members to help others, and so the knowledge is imparted to ever-more people both on and off the site.<br /><br />I, for one, am very impressed with the commitment and contribution you&#039;ve made to our community, and it is a fact that it would be a much, much less secure place without it.<br /><br />Libertas

Bravo! And I just want to state that PGP Club is most certainly NOT a &quot;small&quot; contribution. By encouraging and teaching others how to safely use PGP to protect themselves from the nanny-state you are empowering them in their fight against it. Even if they have no desire to change the system, the knowledge that suddenly their communications can&#039;t be intercepted by government agents will start a fire burning inside them. The longer they stay here, the more they integrate into this community, the hotter that fire will begin to burn.<br /><br />Your contribution is a huge one, and you shouldn&#039;t be so modest about it. Many here - in fact saying 60%+ probably wouldn&#039;t be far off - owe their knowledge of PGP to you and the other members of the Club you set up. You encourage those members to help others, and so the knowledge is imparted to ever-more people both on and off the site.<br /><br />I, for one, am very impressed with the commitment and contribution you&#039;ve made to our community, and it is a fact that it would be a much, much less secure place without it.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yes. Pine is most likely the top contributor to Silk Road forums.<br />Pine should get paid for the amount of effort that is put in, or at least set up a bitcoin address that we could make donations to.

				Thanks to all for their comments, I should say that I wrote the above primarily because of a thread (that now appears to have vanished) in which the OP described some TV stars who would definitely be pro free markets for drugs (Bill Maher on HBO I think, but I could be mistaken), but whom on a television show involving the question &quot;what can you buy with bitcoin&quot; were very obviously studiously avoiding the subject of SR.<br /><br />That pissed me off.<br /><br />Although they may be considering themselves &#039;astute&#039; regarding their employment prospects, the fact of the matter is that they&#039;re not living up to their convictions. It&#039;s no good to philosophize in theory and kowtow to the DEA in practice. It&#039;s like dying your hair pink to rebel against your parents when you&#039;re a teenager but continuing to let them pay the electric bill, it doesn&#039;t compute.<br /><br />There is a long, long list of celebrities who should publicly endorse the Silk Road because they *already are anti drug war and pro free market*.<br /><br />You cannot be anti drug war and pro free market without endorsing the Silk Road because that would make you a total hypocrite. You don&#039;t support the Drug War? Big woop, guess what, practically nobody does, it&#039;s no news story, not even for hardcore conservatives like Pat Robertson. You ain&#039;t taking no leap against convention by stating you&#039;re against the Drug War on television, if anything it&#039;s the reverse.<br /><br />Here are a list of just three people Pine thinks should publicly endorse the Silk Road and darknet markets in general:<br /><br />Penn Jillette&nbsp; <br />http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/05/21/penn_jillette_on_drug_war_states_rights_doesnt_mean_jack_sht_to_obama.html<br /><br />Bill Maher<br />http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/22/eugene-jarecki-bill-maher_n_1906689.html<br /><br />Ron Paul<br />http://www.ontheissues.org/2012/Ron_Paul_Drugs.htm<br /><br />If just these three people took a stand, and said, look, this isn&#039;t perfect but it sure as hell is beating the crap out of the alternatives, put their signatures to a letter endorsing the Silk Road, then a huge blow against the cartels and DEA would be effected. I mean like it or not, the Silk Road is part of the national conservation on drug policy.<br /><br />What exactly is there to lose? If you&#039;re going to be arrested for having your opinion on something this important, then your civil liberties were a fiction, defunct anyway.<br /><br />I would like to see dozens of celebrities, libertarian politicians coming out of the &quot;SR closet&quot;. SR is huge, it&#039;s the elephant in the room for every person debating who purposes to legalize drugs and every libertarian.<br /><br />All you need to do is:<br /><br />Put up some kind of flag/signed message or something on your official website to signify your move, and then make an AMA thread or some statement on SR Forums so that we know it is genuine. Each person coming out of the closet will make a huge difference. Otherwise consider yourself [REDACTED] from the list of libertarians.<br /><br />If anybody on the forum knows of a way to get this message/thread to the right kind of people, it would be appreciated.<br />

				Pine I get that you are all about practicing what you preach, and I totally understand how you feel on the subject!&nbsp; Do you not think that maybe they (Bill and his guest) are not as informed about SR as they should be.&nbsp; Maybe they even have bad info on the site, or they don&#039;&#039;t directly use it, but have designated people for this in order to keep their hands clean.&nbsp; It is also a show and a business, can it not be possible that they are saving that material for another day?!?!<br /><br />&nbsp;It could be that they really are just assholes after all tho!&nbsp; I had a conversation with an author who interviewed Bill Maher once and found him to be kind of a hypocrite.&nbsp; You can find the authors displeasure in his book, &quot;The Know It All&quot;, his name is AJ Jacobs.

				On one hand, what you&#039;re saying stands to reason pine. Its reasonable, its logical, and its morally the right thing. Undoubtedly, people should practice what they preach, and if they&#039;re in a position of media power, its even more important to stand up for what is right. I think most people here would agree with you. I do.<br /><br />However - and I can only speak for myself. But I just don&#039;t trust the government, and beyond that I don&#039;t trust the rest of the population to back what is clearly right. They aren&#039;t educated or open-minded enough to cope with it. <br /><br />I think if celebrities, MPs and media personalities started coming out of the silk road closet, there would be mass outrage. It would make things worse. There wouldn&#039;t be a revolution, there&#039;d be even more war. And we&#039;d lose.<br /><br />Its become clear to me - largely through things that have been brought to my attention via this forum and other dark services, that the governments in power are willing to bend the rules in keeping with their own warped perceptions of human rights, freedom of speech, etc. Not only this, but they are able to get most of their populations to back them, because most people are ignorant, and would rather believe what the mass media feeds to them than think for themselves. <br /><br />So, if silk road really did become a household name, by more people coming out and saying that its a better alternative - it simply wouldn&#039;t be allowed to continue. The law would be changed to prohibit even the browsing of silk road. They could even ban Tor altogether. And the masses would believe it was for &#039;our own good&#039;, to protect us. I know its kind of out there - but its not as out there as SR being publicly endorsed, and allowed to flourish. We&#039;re just not there yet. <br /><br />Its a delicate time, and in my opinion, these battles are still best fought in secret. For now at least.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I hear what your are saying wepromise, but don&#039;t you think keeping the knowledge found on SR secret is exactly what the problem is?&nbsp; The government can pull any wool they want over the peoples eyes, because the people are &quot;ill&quot; informed.
