				<br />After enjoying a sterling reputation for a couple of months, that has been shattered by someone I feel is trying to pull one over on me.<br /><br />I shipped two orders to a user, both with DCNs, both say DELIVERED.<br /><br />I have since deleted the PMs, but I think one of those was a re-ship because the user told me he didn&#039;t receive his order. In both instances, I even sent free seeds to try and be nice.<br /><br />The user now has given me 1/5 saying he didn&#039;t receive anything.<br /><br />I&#039;m now left holding two DCNs for different addresses, in different STATES, and I didn&#039;t put two and two together until it was too late. I have my BTC (I think we&#039;re talking like 5BTC here) but now I also have ruined feedback.<br /><br />I have tried to follow the rules... I delete my PM inbox every now and then, and I use DCN. I almost always communicate in PMs just to let folks know what is going on with my shipping times. I&#039;m working really hard to be a good vendor.<br /><br />I have stored the DCNs in multiple layers of encryption but now I&#039;m starting to think I need to keep all records encrypted on my end, including PMs, just to be able to prove that I am not a scammy vendor.<br /><br />I have contacted SR Admin, and they want to be patient about the whole process and suggested I contact the buyer directly. I have now done this, but I really don&#039;t want to be extorted any further. I shipped two packages and receive payment for one. The 1/5 is not deserved at all.<br /><br />This must be the downside to the anonymous marketplace. Ugh!<br /><br />HMS<br />

				man that sucks!! Some buyers just don&#039;t get it&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />From what I understand with more and more positive feedback the 1/5 will get drowned out and you should be back up in no time.<br /><br />What ever happens tho, if you supply good seeds then your feedback will reflect it the buyers will see this and not think twice about 1 loser 1/5.<br /><br />&nbsp;:) <br /><br />

Yah it sucks not having that 100 next to your name, but you got to expect that from time to time youll run into that person trying to take advantage of a situation. Maybe make a note on your vendor page explaining your side of the deal, detailing that you did a reship and still got a shitty rating. You can only bend so far in these situations, especially if you have DCN saying the package was delivered...twice.

				<br />Yeah, I&#039;m posting about it fairly openly so folks know. I&#039;m still holding out hope SR Support will see my side of it in the end. I just have to be patient to see it through.<br /><br />Thanks for the encouragement. :-)<br /><br />HMS<br />

				You could try sending your established clients to your forum review thread, and maintain a sterling reputation there! Then it wouldn&#039;t really matter what a few shitheads do to your ratings, considering most of the smart and reputable buyers use the forums to check on quality, rather than trying to decrypt the often shoddy and ineffectual short ratings left on vendors pages. On the bonus side, you can actually counter poor service/ quality claims, instead of being stuck in your frustrating situation. Good luck mate!
