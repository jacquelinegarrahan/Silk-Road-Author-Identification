				Hey, a lil while back someone posted a link to something along the lines of a website that indicated sr had been infiltrated because in court proceedings a govt organization did not did not reveal their witness because he was a mole in sr. Ive searched for the topic with no luck. If somebody please finds me that topic/link i&#039;ll send them good karma and perhaps a btc or two. THX!

				I am sure there are many &quot;moles&quot; in SR.&nbsp; If you be safe in shipping and delivery, buying and selling btc, and use pgp encryption/usb OS encryption, it won&#039;t matter.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember reading anything about that informant article though.&nbsp; It would be an interesting read.

It would make no sense to tip off the people they are investigating.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>^This, no governement agency would out their informants, Its just a scare tactic to try and get people to stop using SR.

				I have NO doubts that there are informants, and I would imagine they are closer to the admins than anyone here wants to believe, but just because you don&#039;t believe it doesn&#039;t mean it isn&#039;t true!

				I remember that one.. The reason they said they would not reveal the source was due to it being a ongoing investigation. and the person in question reported that there was child porn here, so the guy who reported is considered the CI and his info was considered private..(so the guy who reported it is the same guy that is the informant, lol) So everyone assumes that SR was infiltrated... This happened well over a year ago.. It looked scary but everything made sense..<br /><br />No need to worry over that report. Not saying there is nothing to worry about, just not that particular thing, lol....

				Child Porn. Have been sexually abused in childhood, I know all the damage that provokes. Hope all of them get their balls smashed and then force fed with their rotten scrotum and testicles after having their teeth smashed and broken.

				It was a reporter who filed a Freedom of Information Act request for all files the Dept of Justice had on Silk Road. They denied his request and the reason they cited was that they had an active investigation with undercover informants involved. Which I assume is just referring to all the agents that are on here buying drugs trying to figure out who&#039;s who. I&#039;ll try to find the link.
