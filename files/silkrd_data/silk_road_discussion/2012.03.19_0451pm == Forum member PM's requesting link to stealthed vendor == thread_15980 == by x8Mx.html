				I became a fan of a certain vendor who went stealth recently and have gotten a few PM&#039;s from other forum members requesting a link to said vendors profile. Is it appropriate to reply with the link if the member claims to have ordered from the vendor before, or does this basically defeat the purpose of stealth mode? This vendor is known to not reply to SR PM&#039;s, so I thought I&#039;d ask here. I don&#039;t want to deny these members the ability to place more orders for this product, however vendors go stealth for a reason, right? Let me know what you good folks consider to be the proper etiquette for this situation, thanks!

				Well, that you made this post, the vendor may accuse you of defeating his stealth mode tactic. Whether you say you did or didn&#039;t. <br /><br />But to answer your question, if I &quot;know&quot; and like the one(s) PM&#039;ing me for the URL to a stealthed vendor, I&#039;d likely give it to them. Especially if they helped me in the past and/or I know they did good business with the vendor before.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they are a noob or a poster I don&#039;t know, I&#039;d be very reluctant to give it out. And by reluctant, I mean I wouldn&#039;t.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are ideologically opposed to the concept of stealth mode, you&#039;d be making a point against srealth mode by giving the url out,

Due to it being people I don&#039;t &quot;know&quot; who registered on the forum very recently with only 1-5 posts, I suppose I won&#039;t give out the url as I have no way of verifying ANYTHING. I can understand the need for stealth mode, so the only way I&#039;d be opposed is if the situation were reversed and I was the one asking ;) This need not turn into a stealth mode thread however, thanks again. Be easy folks!<br />
