				So I&#039;ve been noticing the ability to connect to SR has been REALLY on-and-off of late.&nbsp; Probably 1 in 3 attempts to do something on the actual SR site either times out or can&#039;t establish connection at all.<br /><br />I did do the latest Tor update, which I know knocked out a few high-bandwidth nodes (kind of scary, when you think of the WHY behind it).&nbsp; But I have found that on all other sites I visit via Tor it&#039;s the same-old-same-old.&nbsp; Is this an issue on SR server capacity side after the outage a little while ago?&nbsp; Anybody have any info on that?<br /><br />The forums are definitely better connection-wise than SR, which leads me to believe it&#039;s probably something on SR&#039;s side.&nbsp; But I&#039;m wondering if anybody has an inside scoop.....<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been experiencing this exactly as you described and it all started after the SR outage. I thought it was in my head so I didn&#039;t say anything but now that you&#039;ve mentioned it. Well, thank Science!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using the latest Tor Browser Bundle and two different ISPs (thanks neighbours :D) and I&#039;m getting similar behaviour. *le sigh*

				Well I think the reason SR went down was that an entire server was pulled and they had to move everything over to a backup server that has less capability/bandwidth.&nbsp; But I&#039;m just repeating what I heard mumbling about at the time, so it could be absolute shit.<br /><br />That&#039;s why i&#039;m asking.&nbsp; Would the real Unix admin please stand up?

				During certain hours I find it hard to connect, but once I&#039;m in, I&#039;m pretty much in.<br />I chalk it up to high traffic more than anything.<br />This time of night I have no problems!<br /><br />:P
