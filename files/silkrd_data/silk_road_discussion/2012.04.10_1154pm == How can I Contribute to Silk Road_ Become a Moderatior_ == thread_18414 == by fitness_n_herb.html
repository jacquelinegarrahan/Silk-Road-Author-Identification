				I&#039;d have to agree on giving out answer.<br />Being a nice community person.<br /><br />There&#039;s a LOT of paranoid and angry people here, and there&#039;s also a lot of nice fellows.<br />But people really like a community better when we have that backbone of support, for any questions that need to be asked.<br /><br />Someone who can tolerate trolls and pointless ragers.

I think just helping out around the community (answer a stupid question with a non asshole, honest answer. Give someone that .2BTC loan so they can get their fix. Things like that.) and ignoring some of the more negative people (see example A above) would be very helpful to the forums, and SR in general. But that&#039;s just my opinion on it, so take it as you will.

				You want to contribute to Silk Road?&nbsp; Set up a Tor relay, that way you can help the people on SR get here without being profiled or monitored in some way that might lead to their real-life identity being revealed.&nbsp; And, you help the many people living in repressive regimes get the word of their day-to-day struggles to other people.&nbsp; Yeah, a Tor relay is a good thing you can do for so many people who really need it. <br />

				Asking to be a mod on a place like this - could be genuine as people might partake of something and think &#039;wow I want to help out here!&#039; As for LEA I do nor worry about them but its the sellers who need worry not buyers or whoever runs this site. They/ we are all &#039;potential&#039; targets but there is a lot of serious shit going on in the world and which police force can actually even afford to even try to bring this site down? Bigger fish to fry. More coke coming in at the local airports actually.<br /><br />I would love to be a mod here! Donations could be given sometimes! And maybe a little gift now and again! Well I wish I ran the site but as ever someone has to be the first with an idea and good luck really. Its great being a customer here. Great to know you got the quality stuff not the rubbish offered on the street level. UK coke is a joke in the street. Speed hard t find. Good E rare! Good coke VERY rare. Good anything rare unless you can produce it. <br /><br />I like being here as a little buyer who treats myself sometimes.<br /><br />Me love you long time if you make me a mod. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br />You no make me a mod - me cry&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Crying make me sad.<br /><br />so sad!&nbsp; :&#039;( :&#039;(

I sent the mods bitcoins for their work, and have spent speant of money on here. Please be careful posting crap like that. Like another guy said, our community needs to be strong. Being skeptical is a good thing, but insulting with no information besides your thoughts, man not cool.<br /><br />I appreciate you looking out for the community, but your comment was rather rude man.<br />And the Mods do a great job. Its no easy task, all I wanted to do is contribute man, I can code and offer server space. For now, I will stick to sending em a few bucks :)
