				From what I understand your only;y recourse is bad feedback and the forums in a case like you mentioned.&nbsp; SR support resolution would only look to see if the vendor has DCN and unless they had more complaints of the same nature would side with the Vendor. This is why it is recommended to look at vendor feedback and length of time they have been vending combined with a forum search to make sure they recently have not gone astray.&nbsp; Start with smaller orders to get familiar with the vendor befrore jumping in head first. I have noticed that it is better for a vendor to have a great customer base why would they throw it all away for a quick scam....Not saying it doesn&#039;t happen but with small risk comes great rewards

				If you do your research on the forums, you&#039;ll very quickly get an idea of who has quality product. By dealing with an established vendor, you can eliminate 90% of buyer headaches.<br /><br />The resolution center (accessed by clicking &#039;resolve&#039; next to your order) is your friend. If your order didn&#039;t show, wasn&#039;t as expected, etc, etc, the SR staff will work with you and the vendor to resolve the issue. It is generally a good idea to PM the vendor first, as many times things can be resolved just between the two of you. If you finalize early (FE--meaning you release your funds before you recieve your product), then there is nothing SR can do to help you. FE is the number one way that buyers get scammed, and by avoiding it, you&#039;ll lessen your risk of getting ripped off.<br /><br />Lastly, when your order is a few days late, don&#039;t immediately come to the forums shouting &#039;WTF!! VENDOR XYZ IS FUCKING ASSHOLE SCAMMER STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Impatient newbies do this, and it is fucking lame. If you&#039;re having issues, calmly and respectfully send the Vendor a PM on SR and then take it to the resolution center if need be. If you&#039;re cool about it, I promise things will turn out better.<br /><br />Lastly, remember that we&#039;re buying illegal drugs on the internet and through the mail. Things are going to go wrong. Also remember that this is probably the ONLY place on the entire planet where you can ask your drug dealer for a refund without being laughed out of the room.<br /><br />Welcome!

				I think since the product was shipped and received that SR resolution will not get involved. I think the best practice is to contact the seller and tell them your concerns if you get no satisfaction from the vendor modify your feedback to reflect your disappointment, I would not just give them a 1 as they did ship you got it and sounds like it was a smooth transaction just you are not happy with the quality which I doubt would be the first time in your life that you bought weed and hoped it was better
