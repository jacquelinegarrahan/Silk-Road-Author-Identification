				I prefer meth. The high from coke is stronger but it doesn&#039;t last long enough. For partying coke is fine, but if I need to get stuff done like work or school meth is better.

				Meth, but I like it too much.<br />For me the meth high is much more intense, and (of course) long lasting.<br />The long lasting part leads to re-dosing to &quot;get through&quot; whatever it is I needed to do<br />(that I conveniently ignored when I reached for the pipe). The comedown is never convenient. <br />I ended up always doing 3 day runs.<br /><br />with coke, at least I can function.

				Meth. But be careful. <br /><br />For me, I prefer coke for certain situations and meth for certain situations. Things can get out of hand with meth a lot easier than with coke. In fact, for me, things never really get out of hand with coke.<br /><br />It&#039;s different with meth. With that drug there is the -potential- that things can get out of hand if you&#039;re not careful, i.e. temporary psychosis.<br /><br />But it&#039;s also a helluva lot of fun, more fun than coke. Just treat it with respect.<br /><br />

				Cocaineeeeee &lt;3<br /><br />Meth i used to like more. I actually was very close to getting addicted after doing it for about a month. I started to change and I opened my eyes and saw a completely different person than who I really am and stopped cold turkey. Never touched it again because i fucking loved it and I saw where it was taking me. <br /><br />I don&#039;t get the same craving with cocaine, and I can actually enjoy mixing psychedelics(myfavorites) with cocaine. I would say that if you have never done meth, DON&#039;T start because it is not really worth it. If you are going to try it, realize it feels fucking great and it is veeeeeeeeery addicting so you better have some limits set. I have not touched it again in many many years and will never again. i can&#039;t even be around it.<br /><br />good luck and be safe :)
