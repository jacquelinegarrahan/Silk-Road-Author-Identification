				I find that bitinstant is very easy to use and the store I go to doesn&#039;t ask for ID when I use bullshit information. I get the bitcoins within minutes but the problem is that I pay an extra $7 in fees between the zipzap price and the moneygram transfer before I have bitcoins on here to spend. Is there a way around exchange fees? This thread isn&#039;t to spam me with offers but to educate me.

				mylocalbitcoins may work for you.&nbsp; I dont think there are any fees, but you do have to agree on a price with the person selling the bitcoin.

				I have never used the service myself, there is no one located close enough to me with reasonable prices.&nbsp; <br /><br />Other people who have used the service have met up a coffee shop or some public place and exchanged cash for the bitcoin.&nbsp; No information has to be exchanged at all.&nbsp; Given the nature of bitcoin i would guess the person selling the bitcoin would like to remain as anon as possible as well.&nbsp;

				For those of you that mentioned local trading or are familiar with it, how do I know the person won&#039;t scam me?&nbsp; How will I know that I am getting bitcoins after I hand him cash? I would think that this method has fees as well since the guy selling needs to make a profit.

				Localbitcoins works. You meet up with the person usually at a coffeeshop or something, where there is wifi. Make the trade right there, they send the bitcoins you hand them the cash.

				To avoid being scammed, wait until you see the btc show up in your acount and see some confirmations before handing over all the cash. <br /><br />The person selling the btc will probably be happy to sell at the mtgox avg because they pay fees as well at the exchanges.&nbsp; Meeting localy cuts out the middle man and both parties save a small percentage.&nbsp;

Wrong. As soon as it is sent and shows up on blockchain there is no way to reverse it.

				I thought you were suppose to wait for at least one confirmation to protect against double spends.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you include a tiny transaction fee the first confirmation takes less than 10 min most of the time.&nbsp;

				I got real lucky there is 4 sellers Within 10 miles of me listed on Localbitcoins the lowest price I&#039;ve seen out of the four sellers was $13.34 per point I can buy as little as five and as much as 100 BTC<br /><br />And as for remaining anonymous Would you not have the coins deposited into a Ewallet then transferred to a another Ewallet and for the super paranoid another Ewallet then to SR?<br /><br />And can&#039;t you make your own wallet on a USB drive&nbsp; I am a total newbie and all of this is just the information I have been reading here on the forms and on the hidden wiki so don&#039;t know if what I&#039;m saying is plausible.<br /><br />Would like to hope that it is

				Go with the cheapest and safest method possible. LE is not worried about people purchasing small amounts of btc. LE is looking for people who have large amounts of btc to spend. More often than not people with large amounts of btc acquired them in an illegal manor. LE would rather catch someone cashing 20k a month than someone buying a few hundred dollars a month. The small fish buys and the big fish needs to launder. Use whatever method you are comfortable with that, its that simple.
