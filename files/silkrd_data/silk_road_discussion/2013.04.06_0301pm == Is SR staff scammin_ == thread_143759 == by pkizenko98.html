				I don&#039;t really know what answers you expect to find. If you trust your instincts then leave. If not then carry on. Nonetheless I don&#039;t think the culprit that scammed sr is going to come forward all of a sudden with this thread.

				I locked the thread because all you seem to want to do is pick fights and spread FUD.&nbsp; You don&#039;t listen to reason, and there was no point to letting that kind of BS arguing continue.&nbsp; If you truly believe the things you are saying about SR and our community here, then please feel free to find a different black market more to your liking.

				<br /><br />When I speak of customers, I am speaking of all of SR&#039;s customers, vendors included.&nbsp; I said in a previous post that I think buyer protection is pretty solid!&nbsp; Vendor protection however is lax, especially considering the vendors take the majority of the risk!&nbsp; There are always going to be scams, but when SR staff look at it like hey, not our responsibility, I think that is a slap in the face to their employees.&nbsp; Employees being all vendors!&nbsp; Whether they see it as that or not, vendors are working for them.&nbsp; I hate labels, one member was trying to defend this lax security by hiding behind the philosophy of agorism!&nbsp; I say F theory and philosophy, at least when money is involved, because all that righteous shit goes out the window once currency is apart of the equation!<br />[/quote]<br />So true that buyers have all the power when it come to resolution center.

Except that you come across as the sort of person who wouldn&#039;t admit that someone could possibly be right about them, especially someone who doesn&#039;t actually know the content and situation of your life, because it would violate your own belief about your growing identity and place in the world. It&#039;s ok. We&#039;ve all been there and anyone who says otherwise is actually a celestial being pretending to be human).<br /><br />Whatever.

Do not get distracted by the content and keep your eyes on the process. If you are pointing the finger, you have three pointing back at you.

I maintain my own code of ethics, so nothing goes out the window when currency is involved. I wish I learned this decades ago.<br /><br />* When &quot;it all goes out of the window&quot; for other people, what that implies is that all the pretense, pretend and nicely nicely stuff goes, and what is left is the &quot;real&quot; stuff that &quot;real men&quot; and &quot;real women&quot; would never dream of hiding because they are so REAL: fear, paranoia, greed, mistrust and jealousy. If you follow the Agorist principles here, investing in your own power and responsibility alone, all of that stuff practically subsides.<br /><br />Let your attitude be your teacher.

				This post itself is a joke. SR staff did not scam, you got scammed by some user. Personally I think it was a pathetic scam, but hey look how many people fell for it.<br /><br />When you get those Nigerian emails, is it hotmail or google trying to scam you? No, it is not. Use your brain, don&#039;t just send money. Look into it. <br /><br />Don&#039;t go blaming SR for your mistakes, you messed up, live with it.

				I may be in the minority here but I feel no sympathy for anyone who gets scammed. It doesn&#039;t matter how &quot;good&quot; the scam is. If you fell for it, you are a colossal idiot who had it coming. You don&#039;t deserve to&nbsp; keep your BTC. &quot;A fool and his money are soon parted&quot;. Ever heard that?<br />I&#039;ve seen the stupidest scams where the scammers cant even spell properly, I&#039;ve seen the most sophisticated scams that dont even LOOK like scams and at first seem like they dont even want your money.. but I still dont send them anything, I still dont fall for it.&nbsp; I read the other day where some moron was whining about how he got scammed and was asking if SR will reimburse him and the others who sent their money to that Investment Scam bullshit. I literally laughed out loud. Are you kidding me?! Why in pluperfect hell should SR reimburse you for being stupid?! In FACT, if I was DPR, I&#039;d initiate a policy where anyone who gets scammed gets banned. Yup. You know what will happen? Only the people with atleast half a brain cell will remain.. and scammers will not see this place as a giant jackpot of idiots. But DPR is too nice of a guy for that. Alright now children lets bring on the negative karma..

DPR does not have a huge team of people.. he&#039;s got a couple trusted people (at MOST) probable. Lesser people the better. Less people the lesser risk of someone going rogue and pulling an &quot;inside job&quot;. That, and I think its fairly obvious the man is VERY fucking smart. Look what he has built. Look who he has outsmarted and trumped. I don&#039;t see Dread Pirate Roberts making very many mistakes.. and definetly not when it comes to trusting the wrong people. I think the only possible person who probably &quot;could&quot; pull an inside job is DPR himself.. and that&#039;s just never going to happen. If he was that sort of person, he&#039;d have pulled the plug ages ago and vanished with millions. Instead the guy puts in 15+ hours nonstop when the site goes down and I have seen the blood/sweat/tears the guy has put into SR. He&#039;s not about to do that..
