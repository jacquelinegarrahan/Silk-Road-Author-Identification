All of the posts in that thread are probably only from a minority of his buyers. Many of the posts are probably negative because they don&#039;t have their shit in their hands yet. Ever visit forums for certain online games? Notice that most posts are negative toward the game? That&#039;s because the people who are actually enjoying the game are playing instead of posting.

				There&#039;s many avenues to explore here, depending on your motivations:<br /><br />▪&nbsp; The money-making strategy: <br />&nbsp;1. Wait until Dutchaanbod has his listings up again and buy 100 grams from him at $15/gram. <br />&nbsp;2. Resell it at $50-$80 a gram, netting $3500-6500 in profit.<br />&nbsp;3. Spend the $1000&#039;s you make on hookers and blow.&nbsp; <br /><br />▪&nbsp; The Hunter S. Thompson strategy: <br />&nbsp;1. Determine what your favorite types of drugs are <br />&nbsp;2. Buy drugs with similar effects and others that interest you<br />&nbsp;3. Take a drug-fueled trip to Las Vegas with your buddies.<br /><br />▪&nbsp; The drug addict strategy: <br />&nbsp;1. Become hopelessly addicted to a drug like meth, heroin, or magic marker <br />&nbsp;2. Buy $1500 worth of that drug<br />&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Forget to feed your children.<br /><br />▪&nbsp; The electroplating connoisseur strategy: <br />&nbsp;1. Pursue a hobby in electroplating or gilding<br />&nbsp;2. Buy some potassium cyanide from emerald (and some Kool-aid to help parch your thirst)<br />&nbsp;3. Enjoy the hours of high-octane fun you&#039;ll have! <br /><br />▪&nbsp; The Christopher McCandless strategy (my personal recommendation)<br />&nbsp;1.

				Is it purely for your own use, or do you want to sell on?<br /><br />If it&#039;s for your own use, buy a little bit of everything that you&#039;d really like to experiment with.<br /><br />If you want to sell on, buy whatever you know people in your area use the most - that way it&#039;s easier to sell.<br /><br />It sounds simple but you&#039;d not believe how many people think that because certain drugs have higher profit margins, that they can make more money.<br /><br />Like, a friend of mine told me he was going to start dealing coke because he heard it was a money maker, I asked him how many people he knew that would take coke from him, he said about 6 people would take a gram or so every weekend. I then asked him, how many people he knew would buy a gram or so of weed every couple of days.<br /><br />He reckons he could have shifted 4 ounces of weed a week, which in my area would make you around one thousand pound, and you could get the weed for five hundred pound profit per week. While the coke would cost him 600 and would take him about a month to sell.<br /><br />I tried to explain this to him for about a month before he understood what I meant.

Wait until Dutchaanbod has his listings up again and buy 100 grams from him at $15/gram. <br />&nbsp;2. Resell it at $50-$80 a gram, netting $3500-6500 in profit.<br />&nbsp;3. Spend the $1000&#039;s you make on hookers and blow.&nbsp; <br /><br />▪&nbsp; The Hunter S. Thompson strategy: <br />&nbsp;1. Determine what your favorite types of drugs are <br />&nbsp;2. Buy drugs with similar effects and others that interest you<br />&nbsp;3. Take a drug-fueled trip to Las Vegas with your buddies.<br /><br />▪&nbsp; The drug addict strategy: <br />&nbsp;1. Become hopelessly addicted to a drug like meth, heroin, or magic marker <br />&nbsp;2. Buy $1500 worth of that drug<br />&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Forget to feed your children.<br /><br />▪&nbsp; The electroplating connoisseur strategy: <br />&nbsp;1. Pursue a hobby in electroplating or gilding<br />&nbsp;2. Buy some potassium cyanide from emerald (and some Kool-aid to help parch your thirst)<br />&nbsp;3. Enjoy the hours of high-octane fun you&#039;ll have! <br /><br />▪&nbsp; The Christopher McCandless strategy (my personal recommendation)<br />&nbsp;1. Become disillusioned with how modern society operates<br />&nbsp;2. Donate your bitcoins/drugs/material possessions to member of the Silk Road community <br />&nbsp;3. Die in an abandoned school bus in the remote regions of Alaska.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m a big fan of the electroplating option.&nbsp; I&#039;m just sitting here looking at all the things I could dramatically improve by chrome plating them.
