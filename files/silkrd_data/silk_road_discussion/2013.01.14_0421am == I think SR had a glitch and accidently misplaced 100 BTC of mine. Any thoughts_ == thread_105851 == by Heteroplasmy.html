				Hello SR members, I just wanted to let you all know to be careful transferring money fron one account to another... I keep 2 accounts, one account to store BTC on and the other to buy stuff on... Anyways I was transferring BTC from my BTC storage account to my buyer account and my internet connection froze up, so I refreshed and then looked at my account history of my BTC storage account.... It says that the 100 BTC has successfully been transferred to my buyer account... When I check the account history of my buyer account, it shows that no transactions have been made to that account. I am out over $1,400.00 as of right now and all I was doing was transferring money from my BTC storage account to my BTC buyer account. <br /><br />SR ADMIN, SR SUPPORT, SR STAFF. Please help me out! I have e-mailed SR Support from both accounts... PLEASE I AM BEGGING YOU TO HELP ME GET MY MONEY BACK... I can&#039;t afford to lose $1,400.00. I am about ready to cry honestly...<br /><br />-Heteroplasmy

				First of all, why in the world are you using a SR account to store your BTC? Really? <br />Make a secure wallet on a USB drive, what do you think will happen to your BTC when SR shuts down?<br />Input your backup BTC address in the settings tab on Silk Road.<br /><br />Secondly, I doubt SR&#039;s system &quot;stole&quot; your btc. It takes a good hour or two for bitcoins to be withdrawn, deposited, etc.<br />Just give it a good day and you&#039;ll see your coins. Your statement seems bogus anyways....<br /><br />Good luck.

I&#039;m not an idiot... I have been a member here for 10 months, I have spent over $11,000.00, I have a 0.15% refund rate and a 0% auto-finalize rate. I just never learned how to use Mt. Gox or USB wallets or anything like that. In that regard it would be my fault if SR ever went down... The point, however, is that SR is NOT down... Let me explain what I&#039;m looking at on my screen... On my BTC storage account, it shows that I transferred 100 BTC to my buyer account. On my buyer account history it doesn&#039;t even show that any BTC were transferred from my BTC storage account. It&#039;s basically like the two account historys don&#039;t match up. <br /><br />Please fellas, give me some moral support. I am literally about to cry... And can someone please help me figure out a USB BTC wallet? I&#039;ve been here for quite sometime, but I always get my BTC from Sugar Mama or Blue Sky Traders.... <br /><br />Can anyone shed any light on what may have just happened... I am going insane... $1,400.00+ dollars is over a month&#039;s pay for me.... I know I don&#039;t make much money, but its the truth... I saved up so much money so that I could buy some goodies on here and my money was instantly gone after my internet timed out and I refreshed the page... Please people help me... I am so worried right now...<br /><br />-Heteroplasmy

				So your saying its SR systems fault......&nbsp; Because YOUR computer froze up..... Its good your somewhat asking for their HELP and not blaming them cause than you could wave goodbye to those coins....<br /><br />The system doesnt &quot;steal&quot; coins, your 100btc are NOT special. Wait for them to get back to you and hopefully they help you out, but not if you say THEIR system STOLE when it was YOUR computer.

A watched pot never boils. <br /><br />You&#039;d got much further if you would of messaged the staff in private. Now that you made all this noise.

I need to learn how to make a backup BTC address, I need to learn how to make USB BTC WALLET, I need to learn how to purchase my own BTC from Mt. Gox, I need to to learn how to use instalwallets that I hear people talking about all of the time... <br /><br />SR STAFF I apologize for being overly emotional earlier... I don&#039;t make much money... I am a struggling low tier fighter (boxing) and work at an information data entry job by day... I can&#039;t afford to lose $1,400.00 OUT OF THIN AIR...

SR staff will have it fixed in two days, max. Remember, its sunday in most of the world. And while i dont pretend to know much about DPR or his staffs religious practices. Most people take today off. As should you, this whole website and community is a gift, and should be treated with respect and grace. <br />Im sure your coins are fine. A watched pot never boils. <br /><br />You&#039;d got much further if you would of messaged the staff in private. Now that you made all this noise. They might take their sweet time(though, 6 hours isnt much time in the real world. I know in internet centric people, everything is instant)<br /><br />Nobody likes to be called thieves. Even thieves. (not inferring that they&#039;re thieves, its just not a nice thing to do.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually, the first thing I did was take screenshots of my buyer account history and my BTC storage account history and sent them a message explaining what happened.. I then came on here a little over emotional I&#039;ll admit at the time and just wanted more instant feedback from the community. But I e-mailed them first from both Accounts so they definitely know it was me. <br /><br />As far as my thieves comments go... I was very respectful in my messages to them and I publicly apologized I think 4 times now for my overly dramatic behavior earlier in the midst of all of it happening at that moment...

My browser crashed basically right after I pressed send so I refreshed the page and this is the result... I won&#039;t stop worrying until I have my BTC though... I worked hard for that money!

				Generally no but in some circumstances delays happen, give SR support a chance to respond before claiming the system &#039;stole&#039; your coins, that&#039;s more than a little innaccurate but I can appreciate how stressful it must be to have something like that happen. You will get mixed responses on here that will probably just stress you out even more, best to wait until you have had contact with support.<br /><br />Hope it works out ok.

If the sending account says it was sent to the receiving account (one of the strangest &quot;cloaking&quot; ideas I&#039;ve heard so far here), then the admin will obviously see this and fix it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would like to retract my former statement and re-word it... What I meant was that at the time it appeared that SR&#039;s system glitched, and subsequently &quot;stole&quot; my BTC... I love SR and its staff and how they conduct business, I was just extremely anxious, paranoid, scared, and worried all at the same time when I first posted that. I love you SR and I know that you will help me figure this situation out. :) <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well know you sound like total gentleman i know your momma raised you to be.<br />I think the &quot;new&quot; generation is so used to &quot;instant&quot; access to things that waiting an hour for a confirmation that their coins went to their destination, is just mind boggling to them. And produces this pedestrian albeit funny: &quot;STOLE, I SAID THEY STOLE MY MONEY!&quot;<br />kinda shinanigans.<br />Glad u got your money back. Dude, your either sniffing bars wrong or not enough. <br />Xanax. Its literally, a chill pill.<br /><br />God bless its little white snickers bar&#039;d heart.<br /><br />Now Vendors are (or should) be reluctant to deal with you, if your gonna make a stink about waiting two hours for your coins.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, I actually didn&#039;t get my coins back yet, if you&#039;d read my posts I just apologized and said that I trust that SR will figure this situation out and help me get my more than 100+ BTC back....<br /><br />Actually, re-read my posts, I&#039;ve spent $11,000 in 10 months of being here... I finalize early most of the time and within 1-2 hours if I don&#039;t finalize early... I have a 0.15% refund rate and a 0% auto-finalize rate, sir... My one refund which raised my 0% refund rate to a 0.15% refund rate was when Pfandleiher was having all of his problems before he retired and I didn&#039;t get a 5 gram order of Molly. Out of 10 months that is my only hiccup and now you are going to patronize me for getting a little too emotional when my 100+ BTC suddenly disappeared? <br /><br />Please, sir... you need to relax... I have accepted that I am just going to have to wait this out and I have apologized profusely... <br /><br />Like I said earlier, I would love to: learn how to make a backup BTC address, I need to learn how to make USB BTC WALLET, I need to learn how to purchase my own BTC from Mt. Gox, I need to to learn how to use instalwallets.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>A bit strange story....you said you make $1400 a month and spend 11000 the last 10 months (1100 a month). That will leave you with 300 a month for rent, food etc.<br />Like I said....bit strange. But, maybe you live in Thailand, its very cheap living there :-)

				FUCK all the wallet programs in the world. All you need is the original Bitcoin wallet from bitcoin.org and just make sure you backup your wallet.dat file. That&#039;s it. All these other programs and online bullshit is crap. While I have a block chain account and online wallets, I&#039;ll NEVER keep anything in them. As long as my wallet.dat file is on my RAID server at home and backed up to multiple places to where I&#039;ll never lose it I&#039;ll be safe no matter what. Don&#039;t install anything else, it just gets to much of a pain in the ass after that. Want to know where your money went? Do a search on blockchain and find out.

				TC I fully sympathize with your plight as I am in a similar boat myself although of course I feel quite reassured now ever since DPR posted the update on the situation.&nbsp; I gave you +1 karma to try to balance things out, unfortunately there are many people here who will pounce all over you if you make a thread warning people about some aspect of the site, calling you a conspiracy theorist or whatever.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of odd as you figure people should be thankful you&#039;re warning them (I appreciate warnings myself if they can save me time and hassle) but whatever, it is what it is.&nbsp; Hope you and me both get our money back soon.
