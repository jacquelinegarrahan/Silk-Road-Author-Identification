				Im brand new here. I love this place and wish to be a part of it. That being said, I have some questions and was wondering what I should do.<br /><br />I just got some BTC 3 days ago. I put in 2 orders with two differnet vendors. Prior to my order being placed, (and before I got bitcoin) both of them had good communication and seemed eager as me to do business. Since the orders were place, neither one will respond to my messages and my ordered status has gone from processing to in transit.<br /><br />Its been 3 days and I havent even heard an email from either seller. I know patience is important here and im in no rush to receive my packages, I just want some kind of acknowledgement that they have my order. <br /><br />Is this is standard procedure here? Ive read reviews from people on the forums about great communication and order here in 3 days! Should I be worried or just hang in there?<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				If it is in transit, then they have sent it. There is no need for them to message you about it, to be honest some vendors can be a bit funny about answering too many questions from new buyers which is understandable. I am sure if Law enforcement were on here, they would be asking loads of questions and being friendly too. <br /><br />So just sit tight, as I said if it is in transit then that is the seller letting you know it has been sent. They don&#039;t need to send you a message because once it says that the order has been recieved and it has been sent. So basically chill out man and they will be here any day now.<br />

				Thanks for putting my mind at ease. I thought there would be an order confirmation or something else they might need from me. Definitely the answer I was looking for!

				the waiting is the worst part. after a few smooth transactions ( do your research on good vendors in forums and in their feedback) it will be just like ordering from any other site on the internet. and another tip if you want your package a little quicker try a domestic vendor

				Please be aware that there are scamming vendors. They would probably be helpful up until they have your money.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying your vendors are scammers, but do research on each one you&#039;re ordering from (forum search, scanning the feedback, maybe a few messages to see how he replies).

				Thanks for all the answers. I know that until I finalize the vendor does not have access to my money. Neither vendor has asked for an early finalization which also makes me wonder if everything was ok. Ive been reading comments of recent buyers on both vendors and Im seeing a lot of finalized earlys. <br /><br />Im just going to have patience and faith that things are ok. Thanks again for all the help.&nbsp; <br /><br />
