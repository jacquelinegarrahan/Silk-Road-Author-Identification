				I am treading carefully with SR right now, and would like to get a general consensus from the vendors here who may be using the site right now. Have you been able to withdrawl (out of SR) and receive? Consistently? Has there been any oddities that you have noticed as far as receiving and processing order, replying to messages, etc? Have customers been able to finalize? <br /><br />I am very anxious to get back on SR and unload my fentanyl patches that I have been sitting on but treading very carefully. My loyalty lies with my customers and their safety as well as mine. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m not a vendor, but I withdrew about half a grand early this morning and it worked just fine.&nbsp; Beyond that I can&#039;t comment.

				I placed 3 orders before the attack. Since the attack, I have finalised all 3 of those orders and placed 2 more. I have finalised one of those, the other is still processing.<br /><br />So I&#039;ve finalised 4 times, and one of those was for an order made since the outage. Haven&#039;t experienced any problems with this except for the up/down nature of the site over the last couple of days. I have not attempted to withdraw and am not a vendor so can&#039;t comment on those aspects.

				I will be giving it a go later today, I have to get back on the horse and get back to business. I am very sorry to all my customers who may have had the chance to login and message me, as long as I am able to access later today I will respond to all of you and take care of any issues there may be with any previous orders. I will def be working on getting established at BMR and possibly elsewhere so this never happens again. I am also working on an effective solution to contact outside of SR that will be easy for users to pick up/ setup as I would def not recommend using tormail. I am also weary of privnote, although I don&#039;t have any specific knowledge of vulnerabilities I did get a warning about the certificate being untrusted last time I went to use it, leading me to wonder whether they may have been compromised as well.<br /><br />
