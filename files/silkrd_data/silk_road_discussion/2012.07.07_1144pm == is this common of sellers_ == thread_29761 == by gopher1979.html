				I have been talking to 2 different sellers about a product and just when it&#039;s time to order and buy the seller stops replying to me? I have 2 different sellers that won&#039;t get back to me now. I am very confused and to be honest frustrated because I took these guys word that they would sell to me.Is this common on sr?

				Totally depends on the seller mate!<br /><br />Sometimes sellers are inundated with messages and requests... sometimes they have enough business and are too busy to get back to you for what might be an insignificant order. Good luck!

				..be straight with the vendor, if you&#039;re nervous about the trans say so, ultimately vendors are juggling at times so some patience...otherwise vendors arent going to want to go into too much detail esp on packaging you understand...from my experience just asking would it possible to get the said item by fri or next couple of days is enough, anymore specific then its ....well vendors have more to worry about than others?!<br /><br /><br />Best of Luck<br />TWM<br />

				Whats there to talk about?<br /><br />Either the vendor has the product listed or he dosent.<br /><br />If he has it listed and his feedback looks good, order it.<br /><br />Im not sure why you need to be sending messages back and forth.<br />

				Have a look on their profile page. It will tell you when they last checked into SR. Also, have the messages you last sent been read? It will say so on your Messages page.<br /><br />I can understand if your a bit unsure to place an order (are you new, or is it the first time you&#039;ve tried these vendors?). But, if you have checked out their feedback (on their profile page and in the Rumor Mill), and the feedback is good. If they have a good trust rating (95+) and they are still checking into SR regularly. Then I see no reason not to go ahead and place your order. Is there a certain question you really need answering before you order? If so then wait for a reply, it&#039;s your money so you have to be happy about everything.<br /><br />Good luck, I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll work out&nbsp; :)

				I completely trust the vendor. The product is something he had to order special because it was not on his list. I am just confused if he ordered it special for me (and he did and it came to him 3 days ago) why not sell it to me or at least get back to me? The order was not small either.I just wanna get him paid and get started on purchasing on sr.I have 2 different vendors that did the same thing! it&#039;s just weird, great communication until 4 days ago now for one and over a week for the other.

				...also the vendor is a dealer not a councilor -so you deal with your own stress ...however listening, providing advice &amp; patience costs your nothing.<br /><br /><br /><br />TWM<br />

However, you say it is a special order and it was not small. That sets off red flags for me. Lots of scam buyers on here and lots of buyers that seem to forget to finalize tying up the pay out for 17 days. <br />I would probably walk away from it if you had contacted me, and chalked it up to another newbie who is trying to scam, some one who does not realize what they are doing, LE, etc.<br /><br />I know I am beating a dead horse here but, work on building up your buyer stats and establishing that you are here as a buyer and not a scammer. Start small and build up.

				Its probably because the seller is very busy and your asking 100 questions honestly. just give it time and put yourself in their shoes
