				&quot;It serves as a warning to anyone who thinks they can buy illegal drugs online and get away with it.&quot;<br /><br />lol.<br /><br />Also, this guy is an idiot. He had 3 orders intercepted and was still sending mass amounts to the same address? Seems like an obvious no-no

				It would of been much easier to stay safe im guessing the packages with 5g+ value had tracking when it spends an extra two weeks at customs you would know and you can let packages sit for a month+ if your patient to negate a lot of the risk I have had many packages busted by customs over the years never had to deal with LE once because I covered my ass. If he did the same things I did I know he would still be a free man.

				I lived in NZ until recently and SR was mentioned in the press about 6 months ago, front page news of The Herald. He probably saw that and got inspired! I know that&#039;s what got me started down the road!<br /><br />There used to be a coffee shop called The Daktory in Auckland too. When it finally got raided into submission SR appeared on their website with a whole article about bitcoins. I think they even set themselves up as a bitcoin trader.<br /><br />Shame the Daktory shut, ran for years despite the cops knowing all about it until they finally got the squeeze from the big chief on high. The local coppers used to pop in to say hi and leave well alone. Guess that&#039;s what finally pissed off the bosses so they went heavy handed!

				Obviously a PO box opened with a fake ID. Its not traceable to you, unless you live in Japan their not going to stake out $5000 of drugs for a month that would cost\ LE like $20,000. If you can make the cost to investigate you more than what your moving more than your pretty much safe. My methods are proven I started importing stuff more than 10 years ago and this guy could of easily gotten off scott free if he followed basic smuggling rules.

				From reading the news it would seem the three packages were sent to a different address than the one he was busted at.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Except that the packages weren&#039;t even delivered.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t do a controlled delivery.&nbsp; They just busted him.&nbsp; They would have busted him regardless.&nbsp; That is called a false sense of security.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Not quite true, it was a controlled delivery.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Obviously a PO box opened with a fake ID.

If you go to the counter you&#039;ll be arrested, if you don&#039;t they&#039;ll still have you on camera. I recall a woman using fake id&#039;s and PO-box&#039;s was arrested a while ago importing 300g of MDMA from the states; so clearly they aren&#039;t safe.

You&#039;re saying that all you have to do is out wait the cops.

				If you have a box with a fake name and you think something is suspicious you can walk away and they&#039;ll be forced to do an investigation. Probably try to match your face but that is hit or miss, even with your picture on record. I&#039;m not saying they won&#039;t still get you, it&#039;ll just be a little bit harder. You&#039;re also breaking more laws though so it&#039;s a give and take.

				I didn&#039;t see them say anywhere about the packages that were intercepted being delivered.. or a CD being done. Unless this was the CD, &quot;The man received a package sent from Germany which contained approximately 560 tablets of the Class B controlled drug MDMA commonly known as Ecstasy.&quot; Anyway this must have been happening..<br /><br />1. For some reason his address was being monitored.. maybe a snitch.. maybe a previous offense of some sort.<br /><br />2. Customs intercepted 1 package, flagged his address. He still kept ordering more packages to the same address which were intercepted, then they busted him (no CD?, or busted with CD?)<br /><br />I really doubt they would let packages through.. I know in the USA the package won&#039;t get through, the only time they&#039;ll get through after interception is when you&#039;re being monitored and you&#039;re going to get busted. You&#039;ll have the package for 30 seconds lol. Or you just get a love letter.
