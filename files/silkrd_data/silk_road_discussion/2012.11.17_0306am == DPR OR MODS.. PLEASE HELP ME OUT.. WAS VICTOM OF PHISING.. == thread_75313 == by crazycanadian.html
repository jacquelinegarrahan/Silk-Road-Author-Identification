				Hello, someone posted a faster login link on the the thread and ever since i tried it I cannot login and i have bunch of coins in there.. Can you please take a minute and help me out.. My pgp key matches my indentity and email that I used to sign up in the first place.. Also Jesusofrave can vouche for me.. I have also made&nbsp; a couple threads on it.. I maxed out my pin tries on my account as I didnt use it for a very long time and then logged out and tried to log back in and it keeps saying login failed and now I am just worried my account has been compromised... Please help me out..<br /><br />You can even email me on the email that is listed for the account crazycanadian in the marketplace.. thank you.. and just in case<br /><br />crazycanadian@tormail.net/crazycanadian@tormail.org. thank you.<br /><br />I also know who Ive been messaging and talking to, and can provide how many coins were in there, and any and all transactions that were done as well as the bitcoin address where the coin came from that was loaded into the account..

				sorry, you were already given the only helpful advice - which is contact SR support about the issue<br /><br />the mods on the forum are separate from SR support and we only have powers on the forum so have no control over your SR account
