				If I am reading your question correctly you want to buy $60.00 worth of drugs &amp; have it last you for 60 days ? Maybe some cheap hash oil, RC&#039;s or overseas sourced&nbsp; GBL. Set your account to view in dollars rather than BTC &amp; take a long look at the product offers &amp; use the search function. If you are a gambling man then there is always the lottos where you buy your way in to win the goods. Perhaps you will be fortunate.<br /><br />If you meant 60 BTC then my apologies but $60.00 isn&#039;t going to buy your much around here. I wish you luck in your search.

				Ketamine comes to mind. You can get a gram for less than that. I&#039;ve found that when I combine a 50-70mg bump with one good bong rip, I get into a very mellow but colorful psychedelic headspace that lasts a few hours. Very enjoyable. If you spaced it out appropriately you could get a couple weeks of fun, and still have enough left over for a really good k-hole to go out with a bang.

On the wikipedia for MXE it says that MXE is/maybe a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor and amphetamines are dopamine releasers, which means lots of dopamine (GOOD)... the vendor SkippyJiff on here was selling MXE mixed with some type of amphetamine which he said was great (fuckin IV solution tho... fuck that). Whatever you get, make sure it&#039;s as few items/vendors as possible. Less $ spent on delivery costs = more product. Go to less popular/new vendors. They always hook it up to get more long term customers.

				Yes dude for the most part. I&#039;ve got nbome from Tyler durden, hardhustle (not around anymore), katerall (not selling nbome right now), soon nevita.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve tasted, half a tab and smoking some dank buds had me on my ass. Full tab was very strong, and I never did more than that. Ended up selling out before I could!<br /><br />Every time I&#039;ve ordered 25i (my favorite as it is the most visual), it was laid as 1000ug or 1mg and that is PLENTY for a good trip.<br /><br />Have fun and stay safe, don&#039;t take too much!
