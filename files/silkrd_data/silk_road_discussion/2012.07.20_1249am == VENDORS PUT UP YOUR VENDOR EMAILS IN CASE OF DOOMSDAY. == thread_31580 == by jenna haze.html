I get it. <br />Sorry I am not paranoid. <br /><br />And for the record EVERYONE of those post was wrong. EVERY SINGLE ONE.<br /><br />Eventually this site will go away. But not anytime soon.<br /><br />And I&#039;ll answer your question&nbsp; ;) No DPR is not..but the government isn&#039;t shutting down an onion site anytime soon. I do think he is smarter ;D<br /><br />Also I am all for you gathering vendors email address for contacting them if something was to happen.Knock yourself out.<br /><br />&nbsp;In fact I would say 99.95% of the vendors on here already list it on their vendor page...like you said. I just think a doomsday scenario is crazy... I also think people stocking up on water and food for the end of the world is crazy. But people do it. <br /><br />There are also people that eat shit.<br /><br />Sorry if you don&#039;t like that I disagree with you. <br /><br />Oh and sorry I am not INTELLIGENT&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />
