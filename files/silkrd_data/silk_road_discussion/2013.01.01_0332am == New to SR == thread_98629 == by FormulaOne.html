				Hi SR community, I have been reading up on SR for some time and finally made myself do something about it. I am a little concerned over the purchasing process, due to a few reasons. First off, I am going to start trying some small purchases to get my buying power up, but of the things that I would like to buy there are only about two sellers who sound legit (and nice) enough to deal with within the US. Maybe later I will buy outside the US of A.<br /><br />And the main thing that concerns me is understanding bitcoin purchasing and whether or not I am going to get ripped off now... for being new. I thought I had it all figured out and had confidence in buying bitcoins but then read a post on this forum that spoke about someone&#039;s bitcoins being lost and not registering in their SR account, i.e. went to the store and bought bitcoins through CVS and 6 or 12 &quot;confirmations&quot; had gone through but the bitcoins were still not showing, to which someone else replied that they may be lost. ??? WTF? I am sorry, but considering that 1BTC does not = $1, that worries me that my money could get lost so quickly.<br /><br />All right, on that note about 8 years ago I used to buy steroids over the internet and from someone in the UK, so have dealt with Western Union which I am guessing is similar, but would anyone please write back and let me know if everything should still be pretty smooth, albeit the type of transaction that is taking place? And any other sweet information that would help a newbie get their bearings? Thanks everyone, and I can&#039;t wait to get started.<br /><br />F1

				the easiest&nbsp; and quickest way to get btc is to find a vendor that trades green dot moneypaks for btc IME. its as simple as loading the card at walgreens and sending the card number to the vendor. within a few hr. you should get your coins&nbsp; =) just make sure you go with a vendor that has lots of positive feedback and high number of transactions.

				Reputable vendors appear to be sugarmama and captainmal.&nbsp; However I have not used them and have only used bitinstant and wal-mart.<br />I have read thread after thread of people happy with the aforementioned names though.<br /><br />Read some more and maybe message those vendors if you do not want to try the bitinstant/deposit method.

				Please someone correct me if I am wrong, but can&#039;t you just buy an amazon.com gift card and sell it for bitcoin on bitcointalk.org for less than you would pay to a bitcoin broker?&nbsp; Or are they operating on a really thin margin like 2-3%?
