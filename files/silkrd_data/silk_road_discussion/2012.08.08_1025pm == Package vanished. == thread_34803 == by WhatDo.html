				So I placed an order shipped out 6 days ago that never showed. The DCN never got entered into the system? Received another package 2 days ago that should of arrived at the same time as the missing one. Did it get seized? We are only talking 3gs of bud, but I want to know if its safe to order more? Is my address flagged now? Any insight would be nice. Thanks.

				I wouldn&#039;t read too much into these things... having shipped over 800 packages so far I have seen the weirdest things...<br /><br />I shipped a priority package 4 states below mine which has a two day guarantee... it sat at a sort facility between me and the customer for seven days before finally moving on and finishing it journey... I just knew it had got hit but everything went fine... sometimes i think packages fall off conveyor belts or just get sent to the wrong place.<br /><br />unless you get a letter or something else happens that makes you wary of something possibly happening I would just remain cool and for gods sake - DONT SIGN FOR ANYTHING!!!<br /><br />TJ

				I ordered something off e-bay once and watched it ship from NY, to NJ, then Back to NY, then to Ca, across to a central state, down to a southern state, then to a facility near me. Arrived after 39 days with writing on it. First said &quot;Return to NY sorting Facility. NJ is nowhere near XX&quot; The best was someone wrote &quot;Put this on the truck to XX, it has been allover the country. Obviously all the other postal workers can read&quot;<br /><br />It did arrive, beaten, battered and with lots of interesting writing on it.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Sometimes mail takes it&#039;s time and sometimes postal workers have a sense of humor.
