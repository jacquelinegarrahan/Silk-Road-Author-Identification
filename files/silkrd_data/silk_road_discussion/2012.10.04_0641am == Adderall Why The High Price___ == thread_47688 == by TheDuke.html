				First off I love adderall but don&#039;t get why the price is so high. Locally Meth is probably one of the top three drugs of choice. Weed being one and then prescription opiates and meth probably being a tie. High quality meth here can be found for $1500/ounce. I am tempted to set up shop here lol. Buying it by the gram is $80-$120. Anyways i trade adderall scripts for a half gram to 1g on a regular basis. Over the summer I was able to get it for $1/20mg because all the divorced parents would let their little ones stay with their dad for the summer and still get their scripts lol. Vyvanise or whatever it&#039;s called and I think 40mg generic adderall I&#039;ve been giving $40-$60 for 30. The reason it goes for so cheap because adderall isn&#039;t shit compared to meth. Meth addicts will sell their script without thinking twice for a half gram. I&#039;m am a occasional meth user but my preferred method is orally. I have a capsule machine and can make 100 capsules out of a gram of meth. Taking 2 of those will walk all over snorting a adderall. I have never bought speed but from my understanding isn&#039;t it pretty much adderall more or less? Speed can be bought here for much much less than adderall. Meth can be bought for much much less. Just can&#039;t see why someone would pay that much when other options will do it better for less. With that said i do prefer adderall over meth but that&#039;s only because I love the ritual of snorting pills and doing a 10-20mg line of meth just isn&#039;t much of a line and burns like a mofo. Also I can&#039;t smoke meth cause once I start I don&#039;t wanna stop. Anyways i guess im rambling but can someone tell me why some would pay so much for adderall when there much cheaper/stronger options out there?&nbsp;

				As far as studying on meth its very possible. You gotta realize that quality meth is comparable to 2x the strength of amphetamines. I know they are not the same drug but that is a ball park comparison. Say someone does 20mg of adderall that would be comparable to 10mg of meth. 10mg laid out is hardly anything to look at. I bet a adderall pill is around 250mg in total weight just guessing. With all the binders and fillers that adderall pill would be 25x the size of a comparable dose of meth. What I&#039;m getting at is hardly anyone who uses meth would consider 10mg a reasonable dose. They may snort 20mg of adderall and feel studious but then bitch about meth not thinking about the fact that may of done 200mg of meth which would be comparable to 20x the dose of adderall. The secret to meth is find your threshold or the minimum dose that affects you. Mine is probably around 5mg and when I double that im alert, functional but not tweaked. Also people people tend to re dose often on meth. 10mg of meth orally is almost identical to me as 20ish mg adderall snorted. In fact methamphetamines are legitimately prescribed in 5mg doses for extreme obesity and some cases of add and narcolepsy.

				I&#039;m sure it would mix with propyl glycol but not sure why you need that. Meth will mix with just about anything. We used to spike our coffee, soda or whatever else will it. Just get a .001 scale off of ebay and start with a small does and add or subtract to it till you find the right dose for you.

				Well, I don&#039;t take Adderall to get high per say.&nbsp; I take it to get stuff done (housework, homework, studying).&nbsp; I used to get a script but my new doctor is a bitch on wheels and refuses to write a script for me.&nbsp; It is worth even up to $300-$400 a month for me to function properly. If you think about it, people addicted to oxycodone can spend more than that in a week on their pills.<br /><br />Doctors visits, pharmacy copays and insurance premiums can run you $500 or more a month.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are more comfortable with regulated drugs with exact dosages.&nbsp; I have a huge fear of overdosing.&nbsp; Even when I take opiates I do not enjoy &quot;nodding&quot;.&nbsp; To me that is equivelant to lacking oxygen in your brain and freaks me out.&nbsp; I think a lot of people take drugs to improve their mental and emotional state. I would not be comfortable taking something&nbsp; stronger than Adderall or that had the possibility of being tainted.&nbsp; Plus I haven&#039;t heard very good things about meth.&nbsp; I have a few friends in recovery from it and the stories they tell me of what the high was like is not my cup of tea.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				One of the main issues is that Adderall and it&#039;s generics have been in a (manufacturer caused) very short supply since at least July of 2011.&nbsp; It&#039;s still a bit overpriced as far as I&#039;m concerned.&nbsp; Can&#039;t believe some of the prices I&#039;ve seen on here.&nbsp; Knowing what I pay for 90x20mgIR per month *without* insurance - which isn&#039;t cheap, but isn&#039;t insane based on how much i need them to function daily - then calculating the profit to be made off of even the least expensive priced on here, well... let&#039;s just say it&#039;s tempting.<br /><br />Regardless, due to a recent benzo order going MIA due to what presumably are postal backups or priority mail not coming on Saturday, I now have a need for some heavy gaba agonists / sedatives.&nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone is looking for a small &#039;personal stash&#039; of 20mg IRs I am willing to *trade* 10, or maybe as many as 15 of them at a barter value of $10/ea.&nbsp; I&#039;m in need of only the following: Etizolam, Alprazolam, Clonazepam, Soma, GHB/GBL, One gram of clean tar, Potent Indica and/or possibly some proven clean and legit MDMA.&nbsp; Drop me a line here or on SR (name is the same on both).<br /><br />I am not willing to sell any of them for actual money, nor will I be re-offering them unless they fall to second place in most dire priority for me.
