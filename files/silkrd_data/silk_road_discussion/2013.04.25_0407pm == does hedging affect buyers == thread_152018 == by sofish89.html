				When you place your order on the far right it will show &quot;hedged&quot; with yes or no underneath. <br /><br />If hedged you get the USD value in BTC. Unhedged you get the BTC despite the value. <br /><br />

				&quot;kind of related&quot;-question:<br /><br />Are Buyers affected from the Bitcoin currency fluctuation? Or are the prices inserted in USD by the Vendors and then the prices are being converted in Bitcoins at the actual rate?

				All this info can be found in the wiki, the SR guide provides a lot of information people ask here...<br /><br />Plus there were people who have asked this many times before...<br /><br />Would save a lot of time, plus make your experience a lot safer, if you take the time to read the wiki and make sure you understand the system before placing orders and asking questions that are answered.?<br /><br />BUT with respect to your question, the vendor inserts the amount of BTC he wants to receive and then can either set it as post-commission (pays the SR fee) or pre-commission (SR adds the fee on) and hedged (pegged to BTC value) or unhedged (get amount of BTC regardless of value) <br /><br />The BTC values will adjust accordingly. For example if you see my half oz listing it is at 1.06 BTC. If the weighted average (NOT market value...weighted average!) became very very low my price would increase automatically. Same thing if it rose.<br /><br />When BTC soar to 250 my oz listing was 0.86 BTC. Unfortunately customers FE and I ended up losing close to 600...sigh....<br /><br />So the prices ARE inserted in BTC but the vendor can set it to hedge at the weighted average USD value

				Vendors can set their prices to be stable Dollar amounts or set Btc amounts. Almost all vendors set their prices linked to the dollar value so that the price of an item does not seem to change if you have your account settings set to see things in dollars.<br /><br />I&#039;m not positive, but I think if a buyer orders a hedged item and then it is canceled by the buyer or vendor, the buyer gets back Btc equal to the current dollar value amount of their purchase MINUS a hedging fee of around 5% (I think it is 4 or 6%, I cant remember for sure). If that is correct and you try to buy 20k worth of stuff from a hedged vendor and the vendor cancels right away for any reason, you lose like $1,000.<br /><br />I hope I am wrong about that^.

				So if I make a purchase on a hedged listing that is $100 while coins are worth $100 each and I cancel or get refunded when coins are worth $10 each, then I will receive ten bitcoins back?<br /><br />Where do the nine extra bitcoins come from??
