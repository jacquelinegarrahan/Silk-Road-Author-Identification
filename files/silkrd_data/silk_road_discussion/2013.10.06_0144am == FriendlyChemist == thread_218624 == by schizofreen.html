				I decided to clean my inbox and I found a pm I got this year from FriendlyChemist. <br /><br />He was offering me a cash out service in Moneygrams or WesternUnion for 8 percent under the BTC price with no ID required, only a special question and answer form when I needed to pick up the money. At that time I just ignored him.<br /><br />I have read all about DPR&#039;s bust and this same fucking guy is involved in the murder charge, just what the fuck :/<br /><br />I deleted the PM&nbsp; before making this topic cause I couldn&#039;t cared shit about my inbox with other people but I just realized it&#039;s the same guy. <br /><br />Have others have gotten the same PM this year as well?<br /><br />

				Very interesting. Do you remember the date of the PM?<br /><br />I also tend to ignore spam PMs as they never seem to be from registered vendors. The complaint, however, states that the FriendlyChemist in question /was/ a known vendor.

				I think he was LE after reading all this crap, looks like that was an attempt for getting me nailed. Didn&#039;t remember the date though.<br />

				In the vendor roundtable there was a topic I found and he sent several pm&#039;s in June 14th this year:<br /><br />&#039;&#039;Hello,<br /><br />I see that you are a vendor on these forums, so I wanted to bring something Bitcoin related to your attention.<br /><br />I am associated with the company www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org and we are a buyer and seller of Bitcoins.<br /><br />Since you are a vendor, you will surely come into contact with Bitcoins, and you might be interested in an anonymous method of converting your Bitcoins to cash.<br /><br />We buy Bitcoins for 8% below MtGox weighted average prices. We send cash payments via MoneyGram when buying your Bitcoins. We understand and respect that a portion of the Bitcoin community wishes to have their anonymity respected. For that reason, we allow sellers of Bitcoins to pick up their cash from MoneyGram with no ID needed. We can easily attach a special &quot;Question and Answer&quot;&nbsp; so that you can walk into any MoneyGram and collect your cash without needing to show ID.<br /><br />An alternative payment option if you wanted would be to receive a wire transfer for your Bitcoins straight into your bank account. This is not listed on our website as a payment option, but we could just as easily send your money in this fashion.<br /><br />Anyways, I just wanted to take the time to reach out and make you aware of our service. If you have any questions about the service, feel free to ask me any questions.<br /><br />Have a great day.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />Looks like he was the fucking FBI that was part of the DPR bust, logically?<br /><br />DONT TRUST ANYBODY ESPECIALLY WHEN CASHING OUT VENDORS.<br /><br />

I&#039;ve received many spam messages in my time here and I think they&#039;ve all similarly been for Bitcoin exchanges. And I&#039;ve only been here about three weeks (the last two PMs were yesterday, I think) :)<br /><br />It&#039;s starting to sound to me as if the name was read in the July site image and (possibly because it was discussed in the vendor forum) subsequently used for the redandwhite &#039;hit man&#039; story.<br /><br />*Edit: Tsk! I&#039;ve only just realised the most glaring absurdity about this character. DPR allegedly stated that he&#039;d deleted the picture of the assassinated FC on April 5, over two months before the vendor discussion you mention. I think it&#039;s therefore safe to assume that they&#039;re unlikely to be the same person :)<br /><br />This, however, has raised other curiousities in my mind. These communications with &#039;FriendlyChemist&#039; and &#039;redandwhite&#039; were allegedly found on the July image of the server, having taken place in March and April. In listing statistics on what was found in the image earlier in the complaint, however, it&#039;s only mentioned that were around 1,217,218 PMs sent between May 24 and July 23. I suppose this could just be because giving the number over a longer period would result in a less impressive figure.
