				Since the maintenance the other day, I haven&#039;t had a problem getting on to Silk Road at all.<br /><br />The page load times have also decreased as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty darn tickled with the improvements.&nbsp; :D

				It was nice getting the message that they were doing maintenance as well, instead of constantly getting timed out.&nbsp; That was OK with me!

				Once I&#039;m connected the refresh time is pretty good but it was before too.<br />Getting connected is still a problem. I have to refresh the identity 4 or 5 times before I find one that connects sometimes.<br />I think it has to do with a number of exit servers blacklisting the road. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if LE was pressuring anyone they could to blacklist, thus increasing the chances of us landing on a controlled exit server.<br /><br />With that in mind, I still want to edit my .torc file to exclude servers I have determined wont connect to the road no matter how many times I refresh.<br />I am collecting that info a little at a time when I connect. When I have a body of data I will look into editing the .torc.<br />I will report back here at that time with results.<br /><br />I am hoping that removing a lot of servers proven not to connect to SR will fix both the initial connection problem and the one that comes from being connected and then losing the connection when TOR builds a new circuit (every 10 min I believe) and lands on a bad server.

				Takes me a couple of refreshes initially, but once i&#039;m logged in it&#039;s a considerably faster.

				It&#039;s not possible to block a tor site, you&#039;re correct.<br /><br />That came up in another thread, the new url thread, actually, and I posted the a link that explained that a relay node has no idea what traffic it is carrying, whether it is for a hidden service or relayed for a tor to surface session. If this wasn&#039;t the case, hidden services wouldn&#039;t be hidden.<br /><br />So no, not LE or anyone else could pressure anyone into blocking a hidden service by any means whatsoever.

				OK, I think SR must have fed the squirrels over on the main site.<br /><br />About 15 minutes ago it was down for maybe 2 minutes, and now - wham!<br /><br />That front page loads so fast I had to stop and think, did I drop acid earlier today? Nope, it&#039;s been decades, so the site really is that fast.<br /><br />Or I&#039;m having flashbacks.&nbsp; 8)

				I started donating about 20Mb/s of bandwidth to the Tor network about the same time they did the maintenance, can&#039;t imagine that&#039;s really made a difference since my bandwidth monitor shows around 1Mb/s average use by others. Unless of course I happen to be hosting chunks of the site, but I dont know enough about how it works, hard work reading all those developer notes when I can take someone else&#039;s word for it.<br /><br />Also I tend to only make it available from 21:00 GMT to 05:00 GMT, will probably have to cut it back after Xmas, after it does cost money.

				Well it&#039;s no better for me. And there&#039;s me screaming at Tor when it&#039;s probably the fault of my own shitty equipment:(

I wish I had that kind of resource available to me so that I could donate to the Tor network with bandwidth. Unfortunately I&#039;m in Canada and despite being a great country overall we have pretty bad internet. The fastest consumer internet available in my area is something like 7 MB/s and it&#039;s prohibitively expensive. I should make a post in Off Topic about encouraging people to donate bandwidth to Tor...
