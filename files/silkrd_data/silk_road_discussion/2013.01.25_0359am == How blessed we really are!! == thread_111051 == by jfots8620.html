				I completely agree. I would have probably never in my life gotten the chance to try LSD if not for this site. Especially pure clean, legit LSD.<br /><br />It&#039;s like a candy shop.

I presume the one no-show was never sent.

				For me its the foreign hash that is what was really missing in my life.<br /><br />Other thingts like coke I let till I went the USA or Mex&nbsp; ;D UK coke never interested me even when we did have decent purity and a shitload coming in.<br /><br />Shrooms, we always have those.<br /><br />Bud, well, we all have good bud or if not be friends with growers!<br /><br />UK hash and oil is rare but I get that also. It is WAY stronger than foreign hash or oil.<br /><br />I wouls say SR helped me with MDMA which I gave up on. One dabble o Ivorys was enough to make me see what good E really was. 100mg of that was enoiugh.<br /><br />Dexamfetamne also, a nice addiction to the collection and maybe a sub or coke itself!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				I used to love MDMA and real pills but stopped taking them due to dangerous adulterants being added and fake pills, and a few people around me loosing their lives to them, I myself had brush with a near death experience from taking dodgy pills under the name supermen this made me stop and to be honest left me to scared to touch anything to do with mdma again but I always knew some day some how I would find a way to get the real stuff again but as the years went on my attitudes changed and now even though I would love a good old molly roll again I doubt I ever will again because for some reason maybe its age maybe its just the way things were ment to be but I am just content with weed I dont do anything now apart from weed and hash and now I have SR its like give me it all I want it I need it let me have each and every strain I just love weed, cant say I wont ever take drugs again but the way things stand at the moment its just weed for me these days!<br /><br />We are truly blessed dont spoil yourself people remember its not a race a smart drug user will last till the end!

				Its so amazing to have this beautiful place - how lucky are we?<br /><br />What is even better and something I love is those vendors who really have their shit together ... like posting your package off the same or next day after you&#039;ve made the purchase ... that is just THE BEST THING EVER&nbsp; ;D
