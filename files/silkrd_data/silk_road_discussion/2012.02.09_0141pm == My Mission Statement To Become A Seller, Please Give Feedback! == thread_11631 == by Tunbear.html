				First of all, I&#039;d like to say this post is to show I&#039;m legitimately wanting to be a vendor, and would like to know where/how I can add to this and most importantly, if anyone can help me become one and at what price.<br /><br />It&#039;s very long and very formal (I spent more time capitalizing because I type so lazy normally than I did writing it out, and its kinda gay too it felt like being back in school, but I came here blind not knowing what kind of etiquette to use...OK I&#039;m sounding worse and worse..GO :P<br /><br />Side note; I&#039;m on Morphine and Dihydrocodeine so keep that in mind I&#039;m not normally this batshit insane about details :)<br /><br /><br />OK! hi there, I posted earlier to get all the newbie questions out of the way, and have been pouring over the forums and guides, so I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s enough to convince people that I&#039;m genuine.<br /><br /><br />I found this wonder of the web, like a lot of people, because of the news articles popping up. I&#039;ve not bought anything, nor do I plan to with this account, as one of the first things I read was to keep buying and selling accounts seperate. This is my first point.<br /><br /><br />Now onto my reason for trying to become a seller.<br />I have a drug called naphyrone ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphyrone )<br />This was given to me by a friend who works with legal highs, as it was made illegal, so he could no longer sell it so had no use for it (he doesn&#039;t take anything). <br />I&#039;ve been sitting on this for ages as it&#039;s unknown its hard to sell and its not something i wanted to get into. I don&#039;t really take it because I prefer snorting drugs and the taste makes me heave.<br /><br />There is about 400g, all seperatedi into grams.<br />Now, because I got this for free:<br />- I can do it cheap, and do offers (point 2)<br />- I can use escrow, and you will never be asked to finalize until you receive the product.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As a seller, I will follow all precautions. <br />I&#039;ll use http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/guides/shepj.html to encrypt. <br />My original idea was to do it in linux, in a vmware which is stored in an encrypted container with a key and passphrase with a spoof partition. But as this method seems acceptable that will go in the same partition.<br /><br /><br />The first 3 orders will be free, to get a positive buzz<br />The next 5 orders will be 2 bitcoins each, the price after that will be 3.50 bitcoins.<br /><br /><br />ALL POSTAGE WILL BE FREE! <br />Postage will be the g, taped inside a birthday card, and mailed through normal post. <br />I&#039;ve done this a fair few times to friends on the net; sent to germany, US, and South Korea, all made it through.<br />It will be 2 gram bags per card, as to not make it bulky and if you order more, seperate letters are better.<br /><br /><br /><br />I will provide pictures:<br />- Taken with a camera phone.<br />- Opened in MSpaint, select all, copy. <br />- Open another mspaint, paste it in, and save as a bmp, then saved as a jpg (phew!)<br />- I&#039;m aware how retarded this method sounds, just roll with it :P<br /><br />I will include my personal experiences of the drug:<br /><br />#############<br />It&#039;s a very strange high, not like one I&#039;d felt before. First time I tried it I was on my own and I sat at the computer and just typed for 8 hours. If someone had been with me I would have talked them to death. This is unusual for me as I&#039;m very contained when high. You feel very..expressive.<br />When I took it with my missus it was very strange. We both felt such a natural...happyness. Everything was perfect but we weren&#039;t rushing, or gurning, you just feel a really balanced sense of euphoria.<br /><br />-Dosage is tiny, 1g did us for 2-3 days of fun. you do tiny lines, I hated the taste it made me heave but she was fine with it.<br /><br />-The comedown is strange it just kinda...stops. But you don&#039;t sleep, you relax, it wears off, then you mong for a bit but don&#039;t feel rough. But do set aside 2 days.<br /><br />You can search the net but with this group (butylone, naphyrone, all those same sounded drugs) a lot of people mixed up what they got, got missold, etc.).<br />################<br />And of course anyone buying I will follow the guide with encrypting addresses and never saving them (it will go straight on the envelope)<br /><br />Any orders received will be posted within 10 minutes of me seeing it.<br /><br /><br />God damn that was long winded, I&#039;m sorry again but I came in here blind so this seemed the best option :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now, I also have other stuff to sell. <br />As I said earlier (about 4 books up) I have a bad back<br />Because of this I am prescribed Dihydrocodeine Tartrate 30mg, manufactured by actavis.<br />I can include pictures of the box, the leaflet etc. etc.<br />I&#039;m not sure how much to sell these for, but I see 40mg IR listed from the US.<br /><br /><br />Also, I have Zomorph branded Morphine Sulphate Sustained Release 10mg <br />But I don&#039;t think these will sell that well, due to low dose<br /><br />As everything I have was either free, or cheap (yay for pre-paid prescription cards..saves me a bomb), I can do good prices to encourage people to take a chance.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />TL:DR<br />1. I setup this account purely to be a seller and won&#039;t be used for purchases. If I do buy something another account will be made from a different computer at a different address.<br />2. The Naphyrone was free to me so I can do offers; the first 3 are free, next 5 orders will be 2 bitcoins. Final price will be 3.50 bitcoins each. But order 5 get 1 free, and can work out deals for more.<br />3. Postage is free, sent taped into birthday cards, 2 max per card.<br />4. The pictures I will include are totally scrubbed (copy and pasted between mspaint, converted to bmp then to jpg, with a really old phone camera anyway).<br />5. I will include as many details about the drug and personal experience because the reviews on the net are way off.<br />6. Orders will be posted within 10m of me seeing it.<br />7. http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/guides/shepj.html has edumacated me to protect your address, and it will go straight on a waiting envelope then deleted.<br />8. I have other stuff to sell, Dihydrocodeine Tartrate 30mg and Zomorph Morphine Sulphate Sustained Release 10mg, prescribed for a bad back, legit meds from UK doctor, branded.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now I need your help people. Am I vendor material ?<br />Would this be something you&#039;re interested in seeing ? From what I understand it&#039;s $150 for a seller account but I&#039;m not sure what to do.

				thanks for the reply, i&#039;ve been poking around all day (oo-er) maybe it would be better to put the scrips up first.<br /><br />after looking round seeing whats actually popular (i focused too hard on the potential scammers and didn&#039;t check what people are buying more of)<br /><br />the morphine is wearing off so can think more clearly now<br /><br />god this is harder than i thought

				just jump right in.&nbsp; no need for a lengthy preamble if you got good product, have a customer base that wants this product, and send out samples.&nbsp; do these three thing and i&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be just fine.<br /><br />also, not to judge but try to kick the habit.<br />remember that selling drugs on the SR is equivalent to walking down to your local precinct and setting up a lemonade stand and selling drugs.&nbsp; LE is probably on this board right now.<br />getting high is fine, but getting high while selling compromises both your own security and your customers.

				o i&#039;m not an addict, it&#039;s prescribed medication for a back injury<br />actually not a fan of the opiate high myself, which is why i have so much spare, i only take it when the pain becomes unbearable<br /><br />i was hoping to gauge enough interest to see if me putting in the money to get a seller account would get it me back, i&#039;m so poor at the moment that i&#039;d be borrowing it off someone and would need to see a speedy return<br /><br />i guess i misread the community, i picked up a few things from different posts and i focused on too much trying to &quot;prove&quot; myself and not be thought of as a scammer, but if i got a seller account and just put the stuff up and used escrow etc. that would have done most the talking for me hehe<br /><br /><br />i thought you&#039;re not allowed to offer samples though unless you&#039;re a vendor ?
