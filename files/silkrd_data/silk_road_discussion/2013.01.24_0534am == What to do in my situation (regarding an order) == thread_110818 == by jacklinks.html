				I&#039;ll try to make this as short as possible. I placed an order 1/14 at an item price of 14.1BTC (bought 2 = total of 28.2BTC) This is a U.S to U.S sale of cannabis. Vendor marked in transit 1/14, I message seller several times when I haven&#039;t received anything by Friday, then Saturday etc.. It is now Wednesday and I just received my tracking# as the item had been shipped out today according to USPS records. As BTC has risen rapidly if I had bought today the listing would have been roughly 23.6BTC total.<br /><br />Now I know that btc goes up or down and that&#039;s just how it goes, but I feel like this is bullshit because other vendors have gotten me my product in 2 days (3-4 max) So am I just screwed.?

				yea Jack&#039; if u want u can fight it, and not release after recieving. and then take it to SR finalization for some sort of compensation.<br /><br />try talking to your vendor honestly, hopefully he sees where you coming from and you both can come to an agreement

				If I went that route would my refund% or any other buying stat be affected? I wouldn&#039;t want that to happen for obvious reasons

				To wait nine days from marking in transit to actually shipping is shitty service. Might want to leave 3 or 4 of 5 feedback describing the problem.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t think Dispute Resolution is the proper course in this scenario. If you get the product and it it&#039;s largely as described then you haven&#039;t been ripped off.<br /><br />In regards to the BTC/USD exchange rate, that&#039;s irrelevant. Would you propose that you owe vendors more money when the value of BTC drops after your order is made?

				Thanks for the responses. I do disagree with your last paragraph Eddiegun.<br /><br />When I make a payment to a vendor, although it is in escrow it is essentially theirs. I no longer have the money and the only way I could get it back is through a dispute if I didn&#039;t receive the product.<br /><br />In my situation I paid 1/14 and the item was marked in transit shortly after (I placed it in the wee hours of Monday morning) Now Bitcoins did go up by the weekend, but had I received it by the weekend or even Tuesday at the latest I would not be making this thread. <br /><br />I could have placed the order Tuesday with another vendor and had my order shipped Wednesday at the latest for less coin.

Does the vendor guarantee 3 day delivery?&nbsp; When I place an order I know it can take up to 4 days to process and ship. If a vendor wants to charge me more for quick delivery I might take advantage but they need to state in there profile what sort of guarantee they might offer. I have had deliveries that push the 30 day mark from remote places.<br /><br />I hope the vendor added more than you ordered if he needed to delay the sending for any reason ( proper stealth is not quick.) I would not want a Vendor rushing and making a mistake over a day or two waiting time. If the Vendor did wait this long to send it, wait till you get the product and are happy with other aspects of the transaction, I would message the Vendor about your displeasure and let them know that your feedback will reflect the delay in sending.&nbsp; This gives the Vendor a chance to make it up from what I would assume is a mistake.&nbsp; assuming you have done your research and are dealing with a reputable Vendor. I have had Vendor treat me very well on additional orders when I have worked with them thru problems that I had no control over.
