				Hey folks,<br />Everybody who is worried that what they wanted to buy this weekend is about to be all screwed up cause of the BTC market.<br /><br />Please stop.<br />Please calm down and also don&#039;t go freaking buying goofy ass shit cause you think you&#039;re money is gonna disappear if you don&#039;t!<br /><br />The Bitcoin Price does NOT effect how much you pay on SR (as long as your vendor is &quot;hedged&quot;)<br />If you were just looking at an item that cost $120 this morning.<br />That very same item still costs $120.... <br />the only thing that changes is the amount of bitcoins you give. but the fundamental Product Price remains the same.

				Why don&#039;t I understand this concept?<br /><br />Lets say I bought my coin at $10/per coin.&nbsp; I have deposit $100 and now have 10 coins<br /><br />Now the price of coin drops to $5/per coin.&nbsp; Don&#039;t my 10 coins now value only $5/each?&nbsp; The price of a $100 item WAS 10 coins and now its going to require 20 coins at current market value.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming the vendors are set up to fluctuate with current market value, but the coins I still have on the road were bought at a different value.&nbsp; What am I missing?

				You&#039;re not missing anything.<br />In fact&nbsp; I think you re-stated pretty much everything.<br />You&#039;re just having a panic attack cause you think you lost all your money.<br /><br />Just trust me. Tomorrow, the $100 item you were watching today..... it will still cost $100 tomorrow. ( give or take $5)

				In fact it would be interesting to know how many people tried to rush out and purchase crap for as cheap as they could.<br />We&#039;re supposed to be a community here right?<br />Most of us are grown adults and understand that money does not come from nowhere.<br />Think those price fluctuation just happened?<br />No they were taken out of a vendor&#039;s pocket.<br />Yet I keep seeing people bragging how cheap they got something.<br />Shame on them!<br />Isn&#039;t that like printing your own coupons to Wal-mart? (no disprespect to the coupon vendors)<br />Stealing from the Vendors who take such good care of people?<br /><br />I hope Vendors Cancel Orders in which they lost money due to BTC Price Flux.

				One should NEVER put money onto Silk Road unless they are willing to lose it.<br />Your package could be seized.<br />You could get scammed.<br />Your account could get phished (if you&#039;re dumb)<br />There could be a mistake in SR accounting and you lose some.<br />Worse yet, you could be arrested and everything in your ownership which you can&#039;t prove was paid for with your real Job can be seized for as little as owning a scale and some packing supplies, what are you gonna say &quot;no i wasn&#039;t vending?&quot;<br />For those of us who live in the USA and have been to prison, you know that the law goes &quot;Guilty Until Proven Innocent.&quot; How can a person be kept detained during an entire court procedure if they are Presumed Innocent? If you can&#039;t pay your bail, that&#039;s what happens to your during your 12-24 month court case.

				I think we all know that the listing is still going to be listed at the same price tomorrow.&nbsp; The question is whether or not the btc in my wallet are still worth what I paid for them or not.&nbsp; In the above scenario, buying 10 bitcoins at 10$ each, you have 100$ in your btc wallet.&nbsp; But if the price drops to 5$ per btc, you only have 50$ in your wallet, but paid 100$ for it, therefore, assuming the price never goes back up, you just lost half your money.&nbsp; And no, I suppose that is not directly tied to how much you pay for drugs, but given that most people here are buying btc specifically to buy drugs, it absolutely indirectly effects how much you pay for drugs.<br /><br />That being said I think the dip this afternoon evened back out.&nbsp; Its risky, but I have a small amount that I am keeping in btc - around 15 btcs, and hope to be able to add to it...&nbsp; &nbsp;its certainly not much, but as long as nothing crashes too terribly much, I have made money..&nbsp; My listing says x$ usd, I paid x$ usd via btc, but how much did I really pay for my drugs, considering I bought these btc close to market value several weeks ago??&nbsp; How much would I be paying for my drugs if I had done this several months ago??&nbsp; (Note, I am NOT keeping these btc in my SR account......)<br /><br /><br />GRRRR&gt;.......&nbsp; &nbsp;Ive tried posting this 8 times....&nbsp; &nbsp;NO, i do NOT wish to review the new post, just post please!!!

				Well you COULD go into Account Settings... and switch Bitcoin Vew to USD view.<br />It matters to me none at all if you wanna go about things in a state of panic like you&#039;ve lost something.<br />But $100 on the road yesterday = $100 on the road today = $100 on the road tomorrow.<br />Now you wont ever see a bitcoin again and all the prices for your drugs will be in USD.<br />

				So You&#039;re actually worried that bitcoin value is going to drop and stay dropped?<br />Here we are 4 less than the max price of 49 today<br />Be prepared for scares.<br /><br />I really doubt that coin value will keep falling.<br /><br />The number of blocks times the coin value of a block is the number of coins in existence. The coin value of a block is 50 BTC for each of the first 210,000 blocks, 25 BTC for the next 210,000 blocks, then 12.5 BTC, 6.25 BTC and so on. (source = clearnet https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ#What.27s_the_current_total_number_of_bitcoins_in_existence.3F)<br />This goes on to show that as more blocks are broken.... the less the blocks are worth.<br />Until mining yields no return.<br />Pretty sure bitcoin will keep getting more rare. But that&#039;s my opinion

				ya and each time it halves the difficulty of mining goes up.<br />You obviously do not know what you are talking about.<br /><br />You are telling me to sit on my coins instead of buying any drugs from you, because the price is going to go up. i guess thats what i will do.<br /><br />Please slowly read every post in this thread and then tell me that anything i have said is wrong.

				To sum: hedged order means once order is placed the value of that order in fiat currency (USD, Euro, etc) is LOCKED in and will remain the same regardless of BTC price changes.

				As usual someone that THINKS they know what they are talking about makes a HUGE error.<br /><br />Hedged orders mean NOTHING for the buyer at all. NOTHING!!! <br /><br />That only has to do with the vendor. The vendor can pay 6% to hedge is order. That means where the customer buys something for 1 btc and at the exact time that btc is worth $40 then whenever the buyer finalizes the vendor will get $40 for that order... Even if the btc has fallen to $20 per btc... Also if the btc had gone up to $50 then that vendor STILL gets&#039;s $40 ...so hedging only works for the vendor if they want to lock up the exact price at the time they sold their item... vendors have done this in the past because some orders could take 2 weeks for the buyer to finalize and in&nbsp; that time the btc could have gone down x %....but in the last 9+ months...the btc has only gone up...so if you were to hedge...all you did was lose 6%.<br /><br /><br />Now for the buyer...when you get your btc...and you pay $40 a piece...just use them that day! Thats it! and you wont lose any value...or because the btc has only gone up...you could choose to gamble and hold on to them to try and make some money...but that would not be very smart..as you bought the btc to buy drugs...not to invest.<br /><br />At the end of the day...with the btc being $45+ for the last 10 days...even if it falls a few dollars...that is a small %....so it is not that big a deal.<br /><br />Where as a few months ago...when it was $15...and it fell to $9...that is a HUGE drop % wise...<br /><br />So again...just buy&nbsp; your btc and use them..and you will be just fine..

				My bad RX king, I did misunderstand your post. I thought you ment it was a bad idea in general. I see what you are saying. <br /><br />Yea I got scared the price was going to drop after such a rapid increase that I cashed out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Funny thing was my short &quot;investment&quot; wasn&#039;t even intentional. When I first got here had a hard time finding a seller that would work with new people. While I was looking I saw the value of my coins rise. <br /><br />But no I wouldn&#039;t look at it as a long term investment. Imho the will come down at some point.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, my post was more to make a funny hence the smiley. It wasn&#039;t my intent to offend or annoy you in any way.

				I&#039;ve thought about this, the value of bitcoin. Here are some conclusions. There will only be 21 million coins when they&#039;re all available, right? I figure the more people use bitcoin, that is the more it is accepted in the marketplace in general (far beyond drugs), then the larger proportion of the world economy will be taken up by bitcoin.<br /><br />Say it gets to 1% of the total world trade; then if that is, just taking a number out of my hat, 2 trillion dollars or equivalent, then bitcoin will account for 20 billion dollars of world trade. 21 million coins, 20 billion dollars, gives some 952 us dollars per bitcoin. (I just modified my post as I had made a dumb math mistake.)<br /><br />If it were to get to 10% of world trade, that would put bitcoin at close to $10,000 dollars per coin! Course I don&#039;t know the value of total world trade, so this is highly approximate. If somebody knows the real number, please jump in.<br /><br />Does my logic seem flawed in any way? I invite critiques, by all means.<br /><br />But this is not in my opinion the only engine of bitcoin&#039;s increase in value. The other is the real possibility that fiat money will be in a sense worthless (it will crash, all currencies, not just the dollar) in the not too distant future. This will make the attractiveness of bitcoin all the greater, and make it even more valuable as compared to all currencies, although probably not compared to precious metals like gold and silver. These two will increase incredibly in value as these things play out.<br /><br />goblin

				Everything you say is true, goblin, but the thing about unpredictable future events is that they are, well, unpredictable. I think the biggest danger is bit coin being superseded by some new software, in the same way that say line wire has vanished since BitTorrent came on scene. But something totally unexpected could happen. In the short to medium term bit coins seem a fairly safe bet, although I expect there will be panics and crashes along the way. But whether we get to the 10% of world trade point seems very much in doubt!
