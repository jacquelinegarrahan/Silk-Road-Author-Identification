				hi,<br /><br />since days it gets harder and harder, slower and slower, and especially hard/slow&nbsp; to get into sr.<br /><br />today (sunday, sept. 1 2013) i was not able to even see the logion page the whole day, up to this minute.<br /><br />usually, if it is an sr problem, there is an info thread from dpr about the situation with casual updates that keeps you informed.<br /><br />is such a thread around ?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />i couldn&#039;t find one.<br />if so, please tell us the link to it.<br /><br />usually there was the link to such a thread on the logn page, but i cant get to this page the whole day now.<br /><br /><br />someone somewhere said, its not sr. <br />its tor.<br /><br /><br />but i reach other sites like this forum via tor.<br />to me, tor looks working.<br /><br />my question : what can i do.<br /><br /><br />we have fast rising btc and it can fall any minute.<br /><br />i dont have to tell you about open orders, open sendings etc.pp.<br /><br />my question :&nbsp; <br /><br />who knows more ?<br /><br />is there any way to login (short, to get the latest data at least)<br /><br />is there any information thread by dpo (or another team member) ?<br /><br /><br />who knows more about thew situation, how long this is expected to be down etc. pp.<br /><br />i am grateful for any information.<br /><br />is it maybe local only ?<br />can anybody log in ?<br /><br /><br /><br />thank you<br /><br />

				I was in the reddit page for SR (reddit.com/r/silkroad) and there was talk of the other two underground markets being down as well, and ut was true. Talk of tor notnets, and what not.<br /><br />Anybody has any ideas. I was half expecting DPR to wrtite something there, but there was nothing. Now I read that he&#039;s made a twitter account. (???) Does that sound stupid to you???
