				I just had a transaction that was fine, but not great. I ordered in the morning and paid for overnight, but it wasn&#039;t sent out until the next day. I messaged the vendor, but didn&#039;t hear from him for over 36 hours. All of the other feedback on this vendor talked about how great he was with communication. I felt like I wasn&#039;t getting the same attention that he gave to others.<br /><br />So I left a 4. I thought he could do better. But I feel bad about it.<br /><br />It seems like everyone leaves a 5 unless things go horribly. It seems like grade inflation. Shouldn&#039;t a 5 be reserved for over and above?<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				I think what is the point of having a bloody ratings system if the vendor just blacklists any buyer who leaves less than 5/5 regardless of outcome? Or they threaten to have the admins delete your account for holding &quot;feedback hostage&quot;. What the fuck is that about?!?<br /><br />Get your stealth sorted out vendors. Don&#039;t be fucking lazy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve left 1/5 three times out of thirty transactions, for products that never showed &amp; the vendor didn&#039;t care to comment on it. All my other purchases have been 5/5.

				I&#039;ve only gotten one purchase but I feel like as long as I get my order I&#039;ll give them a 5. If the product is clearly and obviously bunk or bad though I don&#039;t see why a person should not feel obligated to reflect that in their rating. However I feel it&#039;s more a confidence thing to help bring more customers and help them feel comfortable with ordering. That&#039;s just my take on it.

				What i do for balance is give 5/5 if everything shows up as expected, and just write a bad/truthful feedback in the text area .&nbsp; I often write long winded detailed feedback , but still turn around and give 5/5 .&nbsp; So you get to rant and still not worry about getting blacklisted or whatever. <br /><br />&nbsp;The detailed feedback gives the vendor something to read and work on and other customers can learn a lot of what happened and not be scared off by a low rating.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I think people leave too little of text in the feedback for others to read from.&nbsp;

				If the only problem you have was that it took 24 hours to post, and 36 hours to respond to a message, you should update it to a 5/5. <br /><br />This discussion has been on the forums already and with the way the feedback is scored, a 4/5 is essentially the same on their overall rating as a 1/5. If a product isn&#039;t posted out for weeks, and has shit stealth, or is a fake product, then leave a lesser score (only after contacting the vendor). If you get the goods and they are concealed then 5/5, and leave detailed feedback with any issues and/ or post a forum review.<br /><br />5/5 ideally should be for perfect experience, but currently the feedback system doesn&#039;t work that way and so anything less than 5/5 really hurts the vendor. If you leave a 4/5 for no reason the guy might not sell to you again.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t think people should be able to threaten or blacklist you for giving low feedback, but in this case the low feedback doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s deserved. <br /><br />

				You left out one piece of information for me to make a decision on the 5/5.<br /><br />Prior to your order, had you discussed with the vendor that you will be purchasing express shipping, and that if you were to do so, would he be able to get it to the post office the same day, or next, which ever applicable, following submission of your order?<br /><br />If the vendor said, yes, Ill take it to the post today if you order express, and failed to do so, then yes, a 4/5 for not doing what they said they would do. A man is no better than his word.<br /><br />If no discussion was had, then, I would have probably left a 5.<br /><br />I have left a 5/5 for every transaction where the vendor actually sent me stuff, save one. And this was very recently.<br /><br />I placed the order, and within minutes sent the vendor a message asking them to cancel. Instead, 2 days later, it was marked in transit. Three or so days after this, I discovered that the vendor didn&#039;t even read the message. I ordered another product from the vendor, and sent a message.<br /><br />The message indicated that I felt I would be derelict of my duties to the SR community if I left a 5 for the first transaction, and I offered the vendor a chance to make things right, and told them I would be open to any suggestion they made.<br /><br />Instead of any communication, both orders were cancelled, and I was blacklisted.<br /><br />I left a 3/5 anyway, because they were such dicks about the whole thing without needing to be. <br /><br />But generally, if I get what I paid for, even if it takes an unreasonable amount of time, I will leave a 5/5. If I order a product, like heroin or cocaine, that can be fake or extremely low quality, I might take that into account, but I have yet to cross that bridge.
