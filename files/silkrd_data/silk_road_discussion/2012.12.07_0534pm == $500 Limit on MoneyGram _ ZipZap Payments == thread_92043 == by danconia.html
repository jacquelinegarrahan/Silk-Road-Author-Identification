				So the limit is $500 where I am.&nbsp; Is this limited to one person?&nbsp; So if I try to make two payments for $500 in my real name will ZipZap or Wal-Mart stop me from doing this?&nbsp; Or if I make one payment for $500 at Wal-Mart then go back to my computer an hour later and submit a new $500 payment will that second one go through?&nbsp; Is there a time period that needs to happen between them?<br /><br />This $500 limit is getting annoying either way.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m going to start a vendor account and trade my cash for more bitcoin (probably even at a better rate than the market).&nbsp; Isn&#039;t there also supposed to be a website where people in the same area can meet up and do exchanges?&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

				I use the bitinstant/walmart method and when i need to send more then 500$ I just do 2 transaction back to back. No biggie just fill out 2 moneygram forms and have them do both.&nbsp; They both show up at the same time for me

				I recommend getting dwolla and mt gox accounts and just getting them verified (scan of gov&#039;t issued it + utility bill).&nbsp; It&#039;ll take a few weeks to get setup but at least you&#039;ll have it as an option if you want.&nbsp; In addition to the removal of the $500 limit you&#039;ll also pay $0.25+0.6% instead of $3.95+4%. You will have control over your bid for the bitcoin if you want to try and get a better price instead of paying market.<br /><br />After you&#039;ve got your bitcoin send the money to a big wallet that will obscure the source such as btc-e.&nbsp; Let it sit in btc-e for a while for this to happen.&nbsp; Sometime after the transaction has completed into the bitcoin wallet you sent the money to btc-e will move the money I into yet another wallet.&nbsp; You can see this in blockchain.info.&nbsp; Once that happens you can send the money to SR and it&#039;ll come out of yet another wallet I believe.

That was my second time depositing more then 500$ and I did and 500$ and a 400$ so it wouldn&#039;t be the same. I used Sugar Mama also 1 time but it took almost a whole day and the fee seemed to be much more then bitinstant but did work very well. sugar mama rocks..<br /><br />think im gonna try out Mnak suggestion sounds pretty good. Thanks
