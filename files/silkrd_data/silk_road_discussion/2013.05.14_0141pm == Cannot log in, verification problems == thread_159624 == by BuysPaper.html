				I keep trying to log in through the usual address: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/home<br />I am using the correct username and password, however there is something strange.<br />Instead of the usual combination of letters and numbers for the confirmation, only 3 numbers are displayed, I type them in correctly but each time the login fails.<br /><br />This is since I updated the Tor browser, should I try using the older version or is this an unrelated problem?

				I would say its unrelated as I am having the same issue and have not updated.<br /><br />The word part of the captcha is missing.

				Same, was browsing just fine, started getting error messages, then booted to login screen with 3 number captcha. Refresh doesn&#039;t fix anything, nor does a TOR restart.<br /><br />Zommb

				If you refresh the page enough, you will eventually get a regular looking captcha.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was able to log all the way into SR!

				Just refreshed to a working captcha, and successfully logged back in (though INCREDIBLY SLOW). Perhaps this issue with random disconnects to a bad captcha and the phished vendor accounts should be looked into more closely for any relations?<br /><br />Zommb

				The page wouldn&#039;t even load for me but just done the latest tor browser update and then got in to sr first time with the new browser. Might just be a coincidence though.

				Hi all,<br /><br />As stated above just keep refreshing until you get a full length captcha. Can you please let me know here though if any of you are still experiencing problems logging in even with a full length captcha?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Libertas

				Is there any chance this is a phishing attack?&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed multiple people claiming they&#039;ve had their passwords and PIN&#039;s hijacked as of late.

				To reiterate - this is not a phishing attempt.&nbsp; This has happened before many times in the past, and I&#039;m sure will happen again in the future.&nbsp; All you need to do is refresh the page until you get a normal-length captcha.&nbsp;
