I logged 3 times and deleted everything or i wouldn&#039;t of posted this.<br />I have coins sitting in escrow so i wonder - i wish SR would get into the habit ( I think they mostly have ) of notifying us of upcoming events.<br />Wishful thinking? cause everything is ok now .

				I admit I get nervous just when it times out. I was also thinking tonight that the best way to keep up is to log into the forums every single day. Now, while I did that to get learnt, so to speak, now I think I need to do it to stay learnt. Would suck to take a break, and come back to utter chaos. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know who JamesDeansSkull is, but I do happen to be a Dean Fan.

				Right now on the SR main page I&#039;m noticing that the pictures and their listing titles aren&#039;t matching up and at the bottom it says &quot;community forums (offline).&quot; I hope these shenanigans are no cause for alarm.

				I&#039;d PM&#039;d Customer Support about the images issue, and was told they were tweaking the front page. I got a follow up that said it&#039;s all fixed up now.<br /><br />And indeed, the front page now appears to be acting like a well behaved front page should.&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;d hope that the operator had a plan a little more advanced for if LE made a visit that wouldn&#039;t allow them to take it over like that. Actually, I imagine it not even being in his actual possession; I&#039;d probably put it up, encrypted, in one of those server clouds and then only ever access it via Tor. Payment might be a little difficult, but perhaps one of them accepts BTC as a payment method, in which case he would be golden.

				pretty sure we don&#039;t get advance notice of updates/maintenance etc. because that would make it easier for attackers to determine where the server is hosted or get other details about it.&nbsp; <br /><br />and yeah, there&#039;s no fuckin way the SR server is located in SR&#039;s bedroom or anything silly like that.&nbsp; you guys do know that there are many companies in less than scrupulous countries who do &quot;no questions asked&quot; server hosting, right?&nbsp; SR is likely hosted in some country that hates the US and wouldn&#039;t cooperate with them, like Pakistan or the DRC or something.
