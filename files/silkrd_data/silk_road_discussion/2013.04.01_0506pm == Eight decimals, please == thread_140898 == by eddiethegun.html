				At $104 USD/BTC, the rounding threshold is around $1. Is this getting rounded off into SR coffers?<br /><br />DPR, are you pulling an Office Space scam on us?

				I&#039;m gonna post my newbieish question here because I think it&#039;s slightly related. I want to buy an item that costs $90.18 on the listings, but when I put it in my cart (with free shipping) it comes to more than that amount. I currently have just under 90.18, but as my money increases due to the exchange rate, the price of the item increases at almost the same rate. Currently, when the item is in my cart, the price is 90.65 - 0.92 btc.<br /><br />Is this because 0.92 bitcoin is closer to $90.18 than 0.91 btc?<br /><br />Edit: It just went down to $89.70/0.91btc and I bought it! Yesyesyes.

When BTC price is rising, the exchange rate that SR uses will be a little lower. If BTC price drops, SR exchange rate will be a little higher.

I understand that the price in bitcoin is calculated by the mtgox average price. So, if an item is listed at $90.18, then the shopping cart price should be, currently, 0.91 btc. I understand that this amount changes with the weighted average even when the item is in my cart. At the moment, this item shows up as: Total: ฿0.91 ($90.12 at $99.0311 per Bitcoin). The &quot;90.12&quot; number fluctuates with the bitcoin. Earlier on, as the dollar amount in my account grew, so did the price, up to $90.60. I wanted to know why this was happening, but I think I understand it now. Wasn&#039;t trying to come off as a &quot;DPR is ripping us off&quot; person, was just curious because I was 50 cents short on some shrooms.<br /><br />Cheers for the response anyway. Have learnt a lot from your posts on here.

There&#039;s an option to display USD in the interface for your convenience, but everything behind the scenes happens in BTC.<br /><br />So, it may be that when a vendor pegs the price to a USD value, the site recalculates the price on a schedule which is not the same as the exchange rate update.<br /><br /><br />For example, a vendor pegs a product to $100. Exchange rate is $90 at that time, so the BTC value is set to 1.11 BTC. Several hours later, SR updates its exchange rate from the MtGox average to $92 but hasn&#039;t recalculated all listings yet. You look at the product, which is 1.11 BTC, but because your changed the display option to USD, it shows up as 1.11 * $92 (the new rate) = $102.12.<br /><br />That&#039;s probably why so many listings have weird prices down to random cent amounts. What vendor would peg a product to a price like that?<br />

				Vendors&#039; prices can also look for a reason other than not pegging to USD.&nbsp; Vendors have the option of setting prices pre or post-commission.&nbsp; If a post-commission price of $39.50 is set, buyers will see the item listed at $43.45.<br /><br />lelmeriodici
