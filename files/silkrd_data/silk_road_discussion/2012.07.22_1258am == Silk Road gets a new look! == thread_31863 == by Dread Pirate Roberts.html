				Yea because another one of the crazy&#039;s noticed it and set off the panic it must be LE alarm. Yet DPR came in and said he was using a new sig that was not working.<br />&nbsp;<br />He then fixed it and said he was going to &quot; clean up the thread so we can stay on topic&quot; and so he deleted all the post about the mistake.<br /><br />So it&#039;s no conspiracy theory... <br /><br />Just a simple mistake made by DPR...<br /><br />

But there are a handful of very smart posters in this forum that are constantly pulling the fire alarm. <br /><br />But the cool thing is.... this is a forum and if they want to make those post then fine! <br /><br />In fact even though I 100% disagree and think they should scale it back 90% on all the LE post and this site going down and this vendor being busted... I like the fact they make there post. This forum needs different opinions and it needs paranoid people. Because one day they will be right :)<br /><br />

				Hey DPR, I have a comment and a question.<br />The new features you&#039;re implementing, they wouldn&#039;t happen to be using javascript would they?&nbsp; Also, adding new css and images would just increase the amount of data needed to be sent and encrypted/decrypted through the network increasing overall latency.&nbsp; Is my assertion correct here?

				Post-Panic-Thoughts:<br /><br />Look forward to seeing the new changes, so many questions. Will you be using a PGP warning message at the message sending facility on SR to prompt newbs to use PGP when sending their addresses to vendors etc. Does our camel logo receive an upgrade? What is the name of the camel anyway? All these things are important :D<br /><br />@ManaFromHeaven<br /><br />It is possible to use special programs to optimize/compress html/css to smaller size. However it&#039;s usually completely unreadable source when you do that.

Those preserve the data to be the same after as before compression.<br /><br />It is where the code of the webpage is syntactically altered in a fashion that keeps the same appearance, but which is actually smaller in overall page size and is the fastest to load for a browser. There is a special name for this technique, but I have forgotten it, it is not obfuscation either, because the intention isn&#039;t to make the webpage harder to hard. Anyway, if you go googling it, ensure it&#039;s with Tor some other time to prevent timing information being collected for analysis or other funky stuff.<br /><br />Paranoid Pine<br /><br />P.S.

				^The design change probably grew out of planned code changes to the backend (database, server-side scripting) and functional elements of the frontend (forms, captcha) that are aimed at improving security and increasing server capacity. If you&#039;re going to revamp the workings of the site, might as well spruce up the design a bit too ya know.<br /><br />Also, I want everyone to be aware that the Tor Browser Bundle does NOT block javascript by default. Torbutton blocks certain &quot;dangerous&quot; scripts but allows others to run as long as they don&#039;t match any rules. Same goes for the NoScript installation included with TBB. If you want to block all scripting, hover your mouse over the NoScript icon and select &quot;Forbid all scripts globally (advised)&quot;. Most sites on the clearnet will not work properly, but this is a must for browsing the darknet, particularly sites like SR. <br /><br />Please make sure you&#039;re using the latest version of not only the TBB, but also the add-ons included. Periodically (and whenever you first open TBB) go to Tools &gt; Add-Ons &gt; Check for updates (click the button with the gear symbol).<br /><br />EDIT: How could I forget the most important part? THANK YOU DPR AND THE REST OF THE SR ADMINISTRATION!!!

				&nbsp; When I first stepped on the Road over a year ago I knew that this was a special place. I was so overcome with a childlike sense of wonder, amazement and curiosity that it took me a few months (and a few purchases later;) to realize it. But it finally came to me.... <br />&nbsp; This could very well be the most important stance for Freedom that any of us will be a part of in our lives....<br />&nbsp; We can all go down to the carryout and buy an beverage containing alcohol and grab a pack of cigarettes no questions asked, both of which kill more people than ANY of the fine products on this site (1in 10 deaths are caused from tobacco and alcohol kills 2.5 million people a year).<br />&nbsp; Now I smoke and I drink from time to time and I&#039;m not against the 2. That is our choice. Just like it&#039;s OUR choice and responsibility to know our body and research anything we put in it....<br />&nbsp; All of you helped build SR what it is today, we watched it grow, emerge like a beautiful fractal in the Mandlbrot, expanding and growing. This time is the most exciting time to possibly be alive in the entire history of the world... the Road is part of R-evolution.<br />The Road is harm reduction in one of it&#039;s truest forms... <br />I extend my gratitude to ALL of the vendors and the brilliant minds that take the time to post useful information in the forums. We all make the Road what it is, a shining star of Freedom,a wonderful display of non-violent civil disobedience and a unified voice against rules put upon us by people who either don&#039;t give a damn or don&#039;t care to understand what liberty means...<br />All of you that care about the Road..... Thank You.... <br />and to you DPR, I love you man..... seriously...<br />Much love, Sincerely&nbsp; darkmirror

				To all that make SR possible...thank you for defending and providing our freedom and liberty from oppression! im fairly new to &quot;the road&quot; and my experience to date has been exceptional.&nbsp; no lost packages or bad deals. just high quality products and vendors that are down for the cause.<br />after reading this thread im beginning to realize that the admins are in need of many thank yous as well! the &quot;hidden heros&quot; of SR are the admins and line code writers that make this international virtual marketplace a reality. STRONG WORK DPR and all that serve to fight our cause virtually!<br /><br />KYmatt

				No yea I think when I first came on here a year ago the look was one of the main things that turned me off from it. It seemed very primitive ya kno. Keeping a well-manicured site can go a long way for sure. I like this idea. It&#039;s lookin good so far, nice job man&nbsp; ;D

				Very nicely done, it looks a lot better.<br /><br />The preview images could be smaller to allow for more listings. I&#039;m not particularly fussed about having images listed so having the option to turn them off would be cool. I&#039;d rather see images under the product description than alongside the category listings, like it was before.<br /><br />There&#039;s now plenty of hooks available to allow for easier customization. If you could remove the inline styling that would be awesome.<br /><br />Job well done whoever did it :)

				Looks like most of the bugs were fixed! Now that it works, I&#039;m really liking this new layout. The mouseover, drop-down categories menu is nice, and I like featured listings panel. It would still be nice to be able to switch styles and go back to the old one just in case, but whatever works. It&#039;s not like this one uses significantly more bandwidth or anything. As long as this style is secure, functional, and free of scripting, I&#039;m down.

				It&#039;s real nice, good job guys. <br /><br />One small suggestion I have is it would be cool if there were more parameters to sort the listings into, rather than just the 3 we have currently (Bestselling, Seller Rank &amp; Newest). Extra parameters could be Highest price, Lowest price, Location etc. Just an idea. :)

				here are a few minor cosmetic problems people might not mention:<br /><br />- the category tree expands the inventory column on the left to the point where it overlaps onto the listings. you could maybe change the color of the text so you don&#039;t have to offset it, though it only seems to be a problem for categories that have long names, like &quot; CDs, DVDs, software, etc.&quot; under Digital Goods.<br />- number of items per category is missing.<br />- the &#039;remove&#039; in the Bookmarked Items on the right is hard to see. most of the titles for items are varying lengths, it&#039;s just annoying really to have to hunt for it each time. maybe have &#039;remove&#039; be on a different line every time? or put a tiny bit of space between each bookmark. the problem i suppose is mostly because of each listing being several lines that vary and being cramped together.<br /><br />a few requests:<br />- can we add &#039;ships to&#039; under &#039;ships from&#039; on the listings? it doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;d be a problem to fit it anymore, since it wouldn&#039;t require an extra column. mostly I want this to be able to search for vendors who ship worldwide, which might be better served by a small icon.<br />- can we add something that tells you if FE is required/required for intnl customers quickly, on the listing itself, so you don&#039;t have to rummage through descriptions looking for the one offhand comment that tells you so? again maybe an icon might work better.<br />- running with this icon thing again, other things that might be useful to know, like &#039;tracking/express international available&#039;, etc. so you don&#039;t have to bother vendors with those questions, and don&#039;t have to go through the process of carting it to check.<br />- I for example, come from what I&#039;m guessing from experience is a fairly obscure country for SR to be shipping to. I don&#039;t know how useful it would be to the community at large, but could we do a survey amongst the vendors, and divide the world up into zones, so they can list whether they ship to said zones without again having to bother them for more info? additionally they might not be able to offer guaranteed prices on tracking/express to a few countries, so zoning on the basis of frequency in the community might help them at least say &quot;ask for shipping&quot;.<br /><br />- i personally think you should have a &quot;switch to USD/BTC&quot; toggle out in the open instead of having to rummage through the account page, or again, having to cart it.<br />- &#039;empty cart&#039; option on the cart page? or maybe even a (select and) remove option per item?<br /><br />- sort by price?<br />- sort individual items by feedback left on said item (and not just the vendor)?<br /><br />anyway, thank you for your time and effort.

I put &quot;latest&quot; in quotes because the Firefox version is actually OLDER! I was running 12.0 but am now using 10.0.5!<br /><br />I will post a message for other mac users in case they experience any problems. New look is nice. Not sure it was worth the trouble for me, but it&#039;s sharp!

				The new site looks fantastic - lovely job. It looks a lot cleaner, and the ability to see images of products in a gallery without clicking is a god-send. I would, however, suggest:<br /><br />1. Ability to sort by price<br />2. Ability to display price in GBP.<br />3. Add view feedback and purchasing stats on the main page at the top, next to messages etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m so proud to be part of this amazing site - it would have been so easy to rest on your laurels, but alas you have endeavored to make this site better and more secure with each passing month. As a libertarian, I am thrilled that DPR promotes the work of the incredible Von Mises foundation and this place is a heaven for me to visit. <br /><br />Long live TSR<br /><br />

It seems like cumbersome to have large PGP keys when the rest of the site is so streamlined.

				until we figure out the problem some osx users are having, try installing windows in a virtual machine on your osx host.&nbsp; You can get VirtualBox for osx here: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.1.18/VirtualBox-4.1.18-78361-OSX.dmg<br /><br />here are instructions:<br />http://damien.co/resources/how-to-install-virtualbox-mac-osx-host-winxp-guest-using-tinyxp-rev-09-132<br /><br />When you have windows xp running, download the tor browser bundle for windows, install, and visit silk road.&nbsp; This is untested, so if anyone does this, let us know if it works.

				Good work guys :) However I do agree with previous poster&#039;s comments, I used to use the numbers next to categories to check for new listings, this is going to be the biggest problem as I could see when new listings were up straight away, now there is no way of knowing apart from looking through all listings every single time, this is going to be very time consuming as before the change I could just check if numbers had increased or not.<br /><br />Long live SR

				Certainly a feast for the eyes, prefer some of new smaller text. And DPR gets a logo!<br /><br />The listings look huge to me, so few on a page, maybe that&#039;s the spacing problem mentioned. I would like to see smaller listings than the old site could browse much faster before.<br /><br />Even the change to the login is an improvement I&#039;ve had several people ask silly questions about that when I showed them the old site.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure more important changes went on &#039;under the hood&#039; than we see tho.

				More like an old bug that I thought would get changed in the upgrade. Or maybe Im missing something:<br /><br />Any reason why when sort by &quot;best selling&quot; an unranked vendor with 0 sales ever would show up before me in the product list? <br /><br />With this new site re-design putting pictures in the forefront and kinda backseating the vendor as a vendor; this matters to me now.<br />

				Most of the site looks much better with the new style, but PLEASE do something about the product listings. It&#039;s much better to be able to see a large number of listings on the screen rather than just a few items with large thumbnails and large text. Trying to compare listings like that is absolutely maddening, even on my 27&quot; 1920x1080 screen--- only 5-6 listings are visible at a time!! Could there be an option to display product listings the old way?

				. keep up the good work DPR! Honestly tho SR is still very young. I suspect this is only one of the many changes that were liable to see. I wander if he added anymore servers or some much needed bandwidth. I think he&#039;s doing a really great job. This place will definitely morph into a different look many more times. I imagine that there has been many offers to buy it. Zuckerbird probably wants to buy it hahaha. How many members does SR have now? Almost 28,000?<br /><br />A great big THANK YOU to all the Silk Road staff who work so hard<br /><br />I will notice the other changes as I travel down the road<br /><br />

				I concur, awesome site improvements.&nbsp; Great work DPR.&nbsp; Are you really doing this all yourself?&nbsp; If so, that&#039;s amazing.<br /><br />I also notice the bug with the Best Selling sort order.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely not correct.&nbsp; I saw a $5,000 item at the top of the list and I highly doubted it was the best selling.<br /><br />I have a few ideas for functionality improvements.&nbsp; Let&#039;s improve the feedback display since this can be very crucial for buyers if they want to buy from a vendor.&nbsp; By default all feedback could display the buyer&#039;s home country.&nbsp; Take this from their settings.&nbsp; Or when giving the feedback the buyer choose which country it was shipped to.<br /><br />Secondly, let&#039;s allow buyers to more easily search through a vendor&#039;s negative reviews.&nbsp; Put a drop down arrow and say show all feedback that is 1/5.

				I don&#039;t &quot;hate&quot; it, but at the moment, I&#039;m not digging it much. The images have become a hinderance to viewing the listings. <br /><br />The &quot;look&quot; is nice, but the gigantic images need to be tweaked a bit, if not discarded all together.

				The new Layout is certainly very nice, congrats.<br />But as already discussed, the functionality in my opinion are worst.<br /><br />- The item count for each category is a MUST. So it&#039;s easy to monitor if new items are added or not.<br /><br />- The picture size could be ok, for people who likes it. But it&#039;s really unpractical to me, to scroll down the list to check the country where the item ships from. With the old layout it was possible to check immediately the country. Now it takes longer. Another feature really needed for this design, it&#039;s a drop-down list with all the country of the category, so it would be easy to filter only the desired country.<br /><br />For all the rest, a great job ^^

				Hello everyone,<br /><br />Today i saw the new design of sr for the first time. My first thought was that it must have been a lot of work to implement all the changes, then that i liked the old version of the site better. I too was randomly logged out. Logging back in took me 10 minutes, i assume that because of the slow reaction time the captchas i entered must have each time have expired too soon. <br /><br />Better looks is nice, but i&#039;m not even sure about that. With the old version the info was presented in a much more compact fashion. The listings page now has pictures of the products but one has too spent much more time to find the wanted products. The size of the fonts is strangely chosen. The name of the vendor, which for me is an important piece of information, is too small. The messages/orders/account menu items are too small. I think the table form was more efficient. Even if the performance issues and the forced logouts were fixed, i would still prefer the older design.<br /><br />

				As a Vendor I&#039;ve had a chance to use the site today. I do like the new looks and it could help draw in more new members to the road but from a vendor standpoint looks dont matter at all to me, just functionality. I don&#039;t like that the account page has less info on the main page and more sub categories. I&#039;d like to have more info displayed on one page so I don&#039;t have to navigate between pages or waste more time clicking and loading sub pages. <br /><br />I do like the new look but I don&#039;t think any of the improvements have made vending more efficient, just less :/

				Definitely a beautiful new look, though the pics are a little large and kinda take up too much room making it a little harder to easily identify seller or country where shipped from while having a quick scroll through.<br /><br />As others have mentioned the item count should be brought back, that i say is a must. <br /><br />All in all top effort&nbsp; 8)

				I agree with many that, while the new &quot;polished&quot; look of the site is nice, the removal of functionality is a huge no-no in web design...item counts, ease of access of certain information, it&#039;s a little bit harder to use the site with these changes (albeit also a little bit &quot;nicer&quot;)<br /><br />In any case, I appreciate the work that went into the changes--especially those we can&#039;t see on the back-end.&nbsp; Keep it up.

				Appreciate your time and upgrades! <br />Although it is eye candy, the layout is a bit more work for vendors trying to access their listings, profile, settings, etc.<br />especially when the site is running slow :(<br />I wish there were a way to customize your toolbar or something....

				The main change&nbsp; I was really hoping for out of all this was to have more sorting options available in the listings.&nbsp; It can be a long process to go through pages upon pages of listing when you are just looking for that one amount or price or location.<br /><br />An &#039;advanced&#039; search I feel would be really useful, that way you can narrow listings down to exactly the criteria one is desiring to purchase.<br /><br />With that said, digging the new and improved SR :)&nbsp; I just hope with all these cosmetic changes that the team so successfully launched this week that they are keeping our security twice as hard.<br /><br />In no way am I doubting that security is an issue as I&#039;ve been around for some time, but we gotta keep this shit going as long as we fuckin can! <br /><br />Nobody wants to wind up in a jail cell 20 years from now over this shit, gotta keep safety as key&nbsp; ALWAYS! <br /><br />I&#039;m always worried that the site may go down after I transfer btc or something, It would suck if it just blacked out for a couple days and nobody knew what the fuck was going on for days...I know it&#039;s happened before and I really hope with the extra bandwidth that the servers can handle all the traffic.

				Hello,<br /><br />for some reason I can&#039;t see menu with new look (first few days it was there, but now gone), all I can see is &quot;Shop by category&quot; and small round empty div under it. I pressed CTRL + R few times too, so all new and changed files for SR should be up to date. Also nothing happens when I hover or click that area..<br /><br />Can provide screenshot or html if needed.<br /><br />Edit: Missed this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32599.0, though problem still exists hovering with mouse doesn&#039;t help :/

				I like it.<br /><br />When I first came here I didn&#039;t actually believe it was real, and that was with the old look.<br /><br />Now, any newcomers are going to be even more mindblown.<br /><br />All you need now DPR is a &quot;favourite items&quot; list.. and an automated email system that messages users when their designated items have come back in stock/lowered price/whatever the variable. <br /><br />Then this truly will be the &quot;amazon of drugs&quot;

If you don&#039;t have it in you to find out how to go about the processes required here to buy drugs online, you probably shouldn&#039;t be here. This is a thread about the new look of SR, not for asking questions about how someone can hold your hand and walk you through the process of BTC, PGP or buying drugs off the site. Just do some fucking research man....If you are going to succeed and thrive here you will need to have some wits about you and it does my nut when I see people asking the kind of shit you are asking.......<br /><br />Riggghhhhhhtttt. Back on topic....I think the pics off all listings give it a great touch. Great job DPR &amp; crew!

				Yeah,<br />essentially using javascript on a Tor Hidden Service is a profound way to impact the exposure or your real ip address. Tor is also sensible to IRC and other chat methods (IRC Runs through Java Script I believe)... That&#039;s why its good to go to proxychains.sourceforge.net and download that proxy server but most importantly get a german web page translator and go to I2P.de and download that. <br />That program should take care of your ip address when combined with Javascript, IRC, IM, etc... It fills in tors voids. <br />Are there any other VPNs like Tor out there that I may not know of?&nbsp; :D

				According to TOR developers, TOR comes with javascript enabled by default and they recommend against disabling it. Unless I am misunderstanding?<br /><br />From torproject.org: https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBJavaScriptEnabled<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why is NoScript configured to allow JavaScript by default in the Tor Browser Bundle? Isn&#039;t that unsafe?<br /><br />We configure NoScript to allow JavaScript by default in the Tor Browser Bundle because many websites will not work with JavaScript disabled. Most users would give up on Tor entirely if a website they want to use requires JavaScript, because they would not know how to allow a website to use JavaScript (or that enabling JavaScript might make a website work).<br />I&#039;m an expert! (No, really!) Can I configure NoScript to block JavaScript by default?<br /><br />You can configure your copies of Tor Browser Bundle however you want to. However, we recommend that even users who know how to use NoScript leave JavaScript enabled if possible, because a website or exit node can easily distinguish users who disable JavaScript from users who use Tor Browser bundle with its default settings (thus users who disable JavaScript are less anonymous).<br /><br />Disabling JavaScript by default, then allowing a few websites to run scripts, is especially bad for your anonymity: the set of websites which you allow to run scripts is very likely to uniquely identify your browser. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I meant newbie&#039;s who didn&#039;t look at the start date and revived a long dead thread. As to why he changed the look, it seem obvious, at least to me. He changed it when the site grew exponentially as people mentioned. Why? Easy. That&#039;s when the site gained real mainstream traction. When you go public(REALLY public) you generally roll out a user friendly redesign. Key example here would be facebook. If you&#039;re site doesn&#039;t look pretty, the untrained eye will just leave. Interface is very important to the non-tech savvy people( or minimally savvy). It&#039;s just growing pains, not something i would spend a lot of time thinking about
