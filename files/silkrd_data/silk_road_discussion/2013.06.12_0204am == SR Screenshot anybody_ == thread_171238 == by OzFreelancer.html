				SR gets underground press from sites that get 1000 hits a day, and maybe a 5-second mention on national news. At the rate it&#039;s going, in five years....it will still be a nothing on the national scale.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171238.msg1225815#msg1225815">Quote from: OzFreelancer on June 12, 2013, 03:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m writing a book.&nbsp; DPR is aware of it and has been as supportive of this endeavour as he has been of my other work :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is monumentally foolish, for several reasons. I will list them numerically, because a coherent paragraph-separated argument doesn&#039;t seem to have any advantages on this forum, where all anyone does is skim-read. So hopefully I can make this short and sweet. And also you will have a convenient way to respond to each point in a 1,2,3 format.<br /><br />1. SR does not need more press. Press could be anywhere from neutral to bad for SR, never good. I think we can both agree on this (despite the reality that SR DOES get press). <br /><br />2. Just because DPR gives his/her/its blessing for an action, does not mean that action is the best course of action. As far as I know, DPR (whether it be a collective or one man/woman), is human, or comprised of human beings. Human beings have been known to be imperfect in several ways, especially when they are involved in criminal activities. You need only look very briefly into the several, diverse anals of organized crime. Though DPR is our leader here on the SR, I would not go so far as to use him as an authority on what the possible impacts on SR&#039;s future could be from a widely-distributed printed work.<br /><br />3. Let us say your work does very well. Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people buy it. Perhaps you even get press yourself (and therefore SR gets press, which is neutral/bad). You&#039;ve just informed, say, 100,000 more people about the road that never knew about it before, and if it ever gained social media diffusion, you&#039;re talking millions. The average person walking the streets today knows nothing of SR (not including these tight-knit groups of drug users and their associates). Why would you want to change that? I&#039;m for freedom of speech, but it&#039;s tricky in a reckless context. A story like SR&#039;s is just waiting for the right jumping-off point to become major news (major news would be bad for SR). Who doesn&#039;t love a mysterious delocalized drug-trafficking operation that has the ability to effectively evade LE?<br /><br />4. You and I both know, as people who understand what the press really is, that it doesn&#039;t matter &quot;how you tell the story.&quot; They could turn &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; into &quot;Vicious Bestiality Gang Rape By African American Wolf.&quot; It doesn&#039;t matter what you write about the SR. They probably won&#039;t even read it. They&#039;ll simply get a brief overview of the subject matter and form an opinion on it without even reading what you have to say, and then they will report. And you and I both know damn well what they would report. <br /><br />The status quo is here to stay, and you trying to get your position across to someone cupping their ears to everything but the word &quot;drugs&quot; is going to be a god damn waste of time. But the worst part about it is you would be doing monumental damage to our thing here, simultaneously. Maybe you just want the money and the limelight; maybe you truly have a principled interest in this story; maybe both. But the best way is to keep your mouth shut to the outside world, which will only ridicule and condemn you for what you are.<br /><br />P.S. Sorry I couldn&#039;t make it short and sweet.

I will list them numerically, because a coherent paragraph-separated argument doesn&#039;t seem to have any advantages on this forum, where all anyone does is skim-read. So hopefully I can make this short and sweet. And also you will have a convenient way to respond to each point in a 1,2,3 format.<br /><br />1. SR does not need more press. Press could be anywhere from neutral to bad for SR, never good. I think we can both agree on this (despite the reality that SR DOES get press). <br /><br />2. Just because DPR gives his/her/its blessing for an action, does not mean that action is the best course of action. As far as I know, DPR (whether it be a collective or one man/woman), is human, or comprised of human beings. Human beings have been known to be imperfect in several ways, especially when they are involved in criminal activities. You need only look very briefly into the several, diverse anals of organized crime. Though DPR is our leader here on the SR, I would not go so far as to use him as an authority on what the possible impacts on SR&#039;s future could be from a widely-distributed printed work.<br /><br />3. Let us say your work does very well. Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people buy it. Perhaps you even get press yourself (and therefore SR gets press, which is neutral/bad). You&#039;ve just informed, say, 100,000 more people about the road that never knew about it before, and if it ever gained social media diffusion, you&#039;re talking millions. The average person walking the streets today knows nothing of SR (not including these tight-knit groups of drug users and their associates). Why would you want to change that? I&#039;m for freedom of speech, but it&#039;s tricky in a reckless context. A story like SR&#039;s is just waiting for the right jumping-off point to become major news (major news would be bad for SR). Who doesn&#039;t love a mysterious delocalized drug-trafficking operation that has the ability to effectively evade LE?<br /><br />4. You and I both know, as people who understand what the press really is, that it doesn&#039;t matter &quot;how you tell the story.&quot; They could turn &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; into &quot;Vicious Bestiality Gang Rape By African American Wolf.&quot; It doesn&#039;t matter what you write about the SR. They probably won&#039;t even read it. They&#039;ll simply get a brief overview of the subject matter and form an opinion on it without even reading what you have to say, and then they will report. And you and I both know damn well what they would report. <br /><br />The status quo is here to stay, and you trying to get your position across to someone cupping their ears to everything but the word &quot;drugs&quot; is going to be a god damn waste of time. But the worst part about it is you would be doing monumental damage to our thing here, simultaneously. Maybe you just want the money and the limelight; maybe you truly have a principled interest in this story; maybe both. But the best way is to keep your mouth shut to the outside world, which will only ridicule and condemn you for what you are.<br /><br />P.S. Sorry I couldn&#039;t make it short and sweet.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I gave you a +1 for taking the time to write a lengthy and well thought-out post. :) I disagree with your assessment of the damage a book can do, however.&nbsp; <br /><br />1.&nbsp; Silk Road is already on the radar of millions, not thousands, of people.&nbsp; Every mainstream western-world newspaper has covered it numerous times from every angle.&nbsp; From my articles, which examine SR as a &#039;better way&#039; to purchase drugs for those who will do so anyway, to the tabloids &#039;Won&#039;t somebody think of the children&#039; angle.&nbsp; There are also regular TV reports on SR.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure where in the world you are from, but where I am, SR is already big news.&nbsp; And the average man in the street DOES know about it.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Unlike my pieces for the press, which can be edited with no input from me, the book has to be 100% approved by me.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; Unlike news, a book is not current.&nbsp; Because of the very nature of book publishing, by the time it comes out, the whole of SR will have moved on six months from when the last word was written.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure there are teams of investigative journalists around the world right now trying to &#039;uncover&#039; the owners of this site and preparing for an &#039;explosive&#039; scoop.&nbsp; That&#039;s not my angle.&nbsp; I&#039;m more fascinated about what underground markets mean in a post-prohibition, post-border, global economy.&nbsp; I need to tell the story that will stand the test of time.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; I&#039;ve already been ridiculed and condemned for my views on drugs and online drug markets ;)&nbsp; http://www.vexnews.com/2013/01/dark-webs-they-weave-drug-dealers-lawyer-blames-fairfax-writer-for-hooking-him-up-with-drug-site/<br /><br />Again, thanks for taking the time to make your points, all of which have validity.<br /><br />x Eiley<br /><br />
