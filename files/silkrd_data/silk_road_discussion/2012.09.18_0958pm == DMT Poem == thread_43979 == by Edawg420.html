				That was really cool dude&nbsp; ;D, i used to write a bit of poetry. Maybe ill have a crack at it about my first DMT experience. Pretty hard topic thou, no linguistic tool such as poetry even seems to get close to describing the nature of a breakthrough trip on DMT.

				Hey guys i have been working on it a bit today and i changed up some of the structure and tried to get the rhyming down a bit better.&nbsp; Thoughts comments and some ideas for the last couple paragraphs would be most appreciated.<br /><br />Thoughts are slipping,<br />Emotions are ripping,<br />Reality is fleeting,<br />My Body is breathing.<br /><br />Caution leaves quickly,<br />Paranoia comes swiftly,<br />Consciousness is heaving,<br />My Heart is beating.<br /><br />Life is halting,<br />Time is faulting,<br />Ego is dying,<br />My Mind is flying.<br /><br />Space is crashing,<br />Universe is thrashing,<br />Energy is expanding,<br />My Being is everlasting.<br /><br />Insanity I descend,<br />Entities come and amend,<br />Joy is filling,<br />My whole is willing.<br /><br />Visions of secrets,<br />Thoughts of the deepest,<br />Knowledge is inspiring,<br />My soul is tiring.<br />
