				I&#039;ll point out that some categories will never make the 1% simply because nobody can make that much. Interesting that the top 1% is an LSD vendor, and of course one could make a vial that&#039;s enough for 10,000 people<br /><br /><br />but shrooms, no way. I know I&#039;m in the top 3 for shrooms and that&#039;s being in stealth most of the time. For cubenis growers you would need a greenhouse size operation to enter into LSD territory. I kind of doubt it would be possible to even package the equivalent for LSD, because it&#039;s like 1000 times the size (micrgrams to grams)<br /><br /><br />for somebody like me that doesn&#039;t grow, but only hunts shrooms in the wild, it would take patches the size of football fields to get to that level. You would need trucks with extra axles to&nbsp; harvest and ship that<br /><br />well, shit. I can dream, can&#039;t I&nbsp; ;D

				Hang on a minute, attacks? You mean the one in April? No this is a problem that has been here for a long time. It is not due to the attacks, some vendors stats are inaccurate by as much as 50%. SR stats simply don;t calculate. Not sure what it is but it&#039;s a problem that has happened to more than 1 vendor.

I know I&#039;m in the top 3 for shrooms and that&#039;s being in stealth most of the time. For cubenis growers you would need a greenhouse size operation to enter into LSD territory. I kind of doubt it would be possible to even package the equivalent for LSD, because it&#039;s like 1000 times the size (micrgrams to grams)<br /><br /><br />for somebody like me that doesn&#039;t grow, but only hunts shrooms in the wild, it would take patches the size of football fields to get to that level.

				Top x% doesn&#039;t say much about the monetary value of transactions, it&#039;s based mostly on number of transactions. Feedback has some impact on the stats, too, but number of transactions is the most important.

				JesusOfRave and Symbiosis are 2 very reliable UK vendors which have probably processed over half of my orders on here. First ordered from these when both I, and the vendors were pretty new here. Now they&#039;re in top 1% it&#039;s crazy. But I&#039;m very happy for their success and they really do deserve it, top products and service from both of these vendors.<br /><br />JOR would be my &quot;go-to&quot; guy for LSD, and high quality hash - My first acid trip was sourced by this guy and it was out of this world, also some of the best hash I&#039;ve smoked I&#039;ve had off this guy. Best thing about him IMO is his warm forum presence and his wide product range. Has lots of different products (gets different kinds of MD, LSD, Hash..). All the products I&#039;ve had off him have been top quality, although sometimes a little pricey for the nice hashes in particular.<br /><br />Then Symbiosis would be my guy for MDMA. Always seems to have the same, fucking awesome product that comes in huge milky almost see-through rocks (appearance means a lot of you&#039;re selling any). Best thing about him I&#039;d say is consistency in product and fucking A* delivery time. Literally feels like you&#039;re buying something off amazon. Click a button and it&#039;s through your door next day. He sells a whole range of products now, although I&#039;ve only ever bought his MD but would happily buy his other products too with confidence that they&#039;d be good.<br /><br />Lately I&#039;m getting experimental though, a lot of my last orders have been trying out other vendors.<br /><br />I&#039;m considering starting to get weed from here too.

Not a post I made from my very first day of being a vendor before I ever sold an item thus being a post you quoted from over 1 year ago! Though what you did do is prove that I have only raised my prices $1&nbsp; the last 14 months since I started selling.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />As many vendors have already said in here...being in the the Top 1% really just means how many packages you are sending out on a daily basis...not the amount of $$ you are selling or your feedback. As any vendor on here that would want to be known as the biggest would be a total moron. So I am sure there are a few.<br /><br />I can tell you that the highest I have ever been is top 2% and that was when I never went to stealth or sold an item in stealth. When I go public one a month now I am somewhere in the 30&#039;s....I would care less except for the fact I get messages about it and it is annoying having to answer them but if I do not then I am being a shitty vendor. It is just the price you have to pay if you want to go stealth or have stealth listings. <br /><br />But in reality all that matters is your feedback and your &quot;item&quot; feedback. As that tells the whole story about you as a vendor. And when you are a new vendor just starting out...you have to be exceptional to get business and keep business. And I think that is a good thing..especially for the buyers. As the vendors will go out of there way to do the right thing. Sadly what happens is after a while the vendors get lazy and complacent and do not hold up to there previous feedback. I see it all the time. Or I should say I here about it all the time.<br /><br />I would never even bring this up except for newbies have actually said something to me about it as they interpreted being in the top x% had something to do with your quality of vending or your feedback. And neither are true as it has already been said in here. THOUGH there are vendors in the TOP % that are fantastic.<br /><br />But I was only commenting because Jack of Spades said &quot;I hardly sell anything anymore&quot;... As if he would know. He obviously does not. If he threw in &quot;out of stealth&quot; then of course he would be 100% correct. ;)<br /><br />Have a good day everyone! ;D

If you send out a lot of orders...lets say 20 a day for 1 month...you will into the top 5 % if those orders are at least $100+.<br /><br />My only point...as were a lot of other vendor before my post..is the top 1% does not mean they sell the most product or make the most money. PERIOD. Nor does it mean they have the best feedback. As most are not even 100%.<br /><br />Here is the Wiki explanation on it----<br /><br />To get the seller rank, we find the averages and standard deviations of the &quot;percent positive feedback&quot; and the log of the total weight of the reviews for all active sellers. We then average the number of standard deviations a seller has above or below the average with a 4 to 1 weight on their average feedback over their total weight. This is a seller&#039;s rating, and we rank everyone according to this rating.<br /><br />There are a few little details left out for brevity, but that&#039;s basically it. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166376.msg1263075#msg1263075">Quote from: Bungee54 on June 22, 2013, 08:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay.. care to explain on which calculus it is based ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I just did above :)<br /><br /><br /><br />And my other point is that it is very confusing to&nbsp; newbies (as well as people here 2 years!)&nbsp; as the fact is as a vendor you would not really want to be at the top..as the target if there ever was going to be someone coming after you would be HUGE as compared to being in the top 50%.<br /><br />But actually all I care about...as I am sure most vendors do too...it that buyers realize they can get a great vendor that is in the 60% range...though they might be newish...the fact is the most important thing still is feedback...as a new vendor could be here only 1 month...sold only 50 things...and have perfect 100 score and be in the top 50% and he would still be worth it for the buyer to use. PERIOD.<br /><br />My other point..is that there explanation given in the Wiki is not clear...I mean it is..but it really is not..as there should be no vendor in the top 1% that has anything but a 100 rating IMO.<br /><br />

				You are correct RxKing.&nbsp; It has a lot to do with the number of transactions too.&nbsp; There are some vendors in the 30% to 40% range making more than a particular 1% vendor because the 1% vendor is racking up more transactions of lower value.&nbsp; The formulas used on SR are quite interesting.

				Following the math from WIKI I don&#039;t see how its mathematically possible for MIMM to be ranked in the top 1%.&nbsp; Obviously I don&#039;t have perfect data but even stretching the numbers far beyond what seems plausible it&#039;s still not even that close.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is much more complicated than I originally thought and was incorrect and apologize for broadcasting misinformation but my original theory seemed the only one possible (that total monetary value was the only factor)at the time especially considering a vendor at ~93% satisfaction is in the top 1%.&nbsp; &nbsp;
