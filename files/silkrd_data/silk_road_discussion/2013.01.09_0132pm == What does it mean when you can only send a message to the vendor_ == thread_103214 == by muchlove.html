				It doesn&#039;t necessarily mean he&#039;s gone.&nbsp; A scam buyer could have reported him and he may be back after it&#039;s sorted out.&nbsp; Obviously i&#039;m not sure because i don&#039;t even know what vendor your talking about, but that could be the case.

				I had a case a vendor come back after exact such thing as the above poster described (scam buyer who reported)... just PM the vendor anyway and ask whats going on + check on forum...

And when I get them BTC refunded if that is the case, I will probably lose fucking coins and be slightly short as I would go to Mr Cronk after NSNS....

				I also ordered from NSNS - his vendor page is still disabled as a I type but he has just marked my order despatched and has PM&#039;d to confirm and apologise for late despatch.<br /><br />Trusted vendor since he started on SR, with &gt; 10 transactions.
