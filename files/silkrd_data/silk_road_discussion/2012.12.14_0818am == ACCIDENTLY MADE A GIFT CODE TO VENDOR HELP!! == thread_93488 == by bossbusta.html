				some one please help me. i literally just spent all my cash on bitcoins tonight. they just got into my account, i was going to make the purchase, but i saw this &quot;gift code&quot; i thought it creates a code for a % discount off my purchase. instead it looks like i sent my money to the vendor as a gift. but it also looks like he cannot receive it until i give him the code. how do i reverse this? thsi is so fucked. im so sad right now. please help someone!

				ive taken 2 sleeping pills to try and fall asleep, but knowing i just through away all my money to a vendor without any product is killing me. took me so long to build that money up from ordering on SR and moving the product in my city. wow. im a nooob on this site. there really isnt even an explination beside what the gift code really is. i didnt expect it to be that considering you can just transfer BTC to any user.
