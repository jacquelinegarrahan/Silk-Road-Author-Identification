				Hi guys<br /><br />@mods: feel free to move this thread to where ever you think it might fit better. Thanks<br /><br />@subject:<br />I started to work on a new file sharing tool. <br />The goal is to provide a very easy to use client and let download any content that has been made available.<br /><br />Setup for end-users will be like &quot;one-click-setup&quot;, all setup and configuration is done by installer.<br />Using the client will be like: search files, add to download queue, publish files.<br /><br />Every client will be only reachable by tor.<br />Every user has to upload in order to be able to download.<br />If someone does not want to share own content his client will be used to distribute already existing content.<br /><br />Local files (besides downloads) and network traffic will be encrypted in a way, that only expected receivers can decrypt any data or information.<br /><br />This system might put heavy load on current tor-infrastructure, so i might decide that every user has to give back the same amount of used tor-bandwidth to the tor network. This will be looked at in detail when the time has come.<br /><br />At the moment it is running as a one man project, but if everything will work out fine i expect workload to increase dramatically. This means that interested and skilled devs should not hesitate to ask for participation. In the beginning it might be some testing and putting load on prototype system.<br /><br />This is my first public announcement of this project, feel free to ask any questions or give me any hints.<br />If you like the idea and want to support me, consider a donation of any amount to my btc-donation address in my signature.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				@TorPublicCloud:&nbsp; Hello, I am the resident dunce - a total retard but I do try to keep up.&nbsp; Would you mind posting a translation of this project for people like me? Thank you very much!&nbsp; :D

				Cool idea! A few issues you may encounter:<br />- You&#039;re going to need to get a PGP public key made ASAP that you can use to sign the binaries for authenticity. I&#039;m not gonna run executable code designed for something clandestine unless I can verify it&#039;s source and authenticity or it&#039;s open source.<br />- It&#039;s probably going to be possible to fake bandwidth data somehow. Come up with a really wacky protocol when sending this data so it&#039;s hard to spoof, and some kind of reporting from both sides (I ).<br />- It would be cool if you could download the same file held by multiple users from multiple users at once (like torrents, use hashing of files to determine duplicates).<br />- You can&#039;t force people to contibute to Tors bandwidth (which this will rape). Once you know a relay name you&#039;ve got someones true IP (I always have a chuckle when I see the &quot;DreadPirateRoberts&quot; Tor node, wonder if that person&#039;s ever had LE look into them lol). That said Tor&#039;s bandwidth has improved quite well in recent times.<br /><br />Also are you going for open-source or closed-source? My recommendation would be open-source.<br /><br />Shoot me an email at amphetamine@tormail.org if you&#039;d like some help developing it, I&#039;d be happy to contribute a portion of my free time to such a worthy cause!

				@WinterMoon: Can u explain what you need to be translated? what language? ..be sure for some project homepage to come up if resonance to this idea is good enough.<br /><br />@ampedup:<br />Hey dude!<br />Thanks for your thoughts, they are much like my own notes and match my own researches.<br />Give me some time to setup a reasonable way to communicate for a project like this, i might just setup a hidden service for that purpose.<br />Your analysis is absolutely correct, fighting fake traffic and ensuring that clients contribute to tor-network will be one of the major parts of this project.<br />Downloading from multiple sources will be one of the core features, both for hiding what you download, and for optimizing availability of files that have not yet enough sources.<br />Coding will start in closed-source to develop a prototype. Once everything is working out, an open-source release is guaranteed. This project can be seen as an attempt to provide a very easy to use tool to access any shared information.<br />I will remember your offer to contribute. Thank you! What are your main skills?
