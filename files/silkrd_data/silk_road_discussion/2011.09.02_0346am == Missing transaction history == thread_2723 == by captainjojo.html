				I know there has been discussion with regards to deleting a buyers transaction history, whether by the buyer or SR, and I have made a comment or two myself.<br /><br />So today when I logged on and called up my account history to check something, I was a little surprised to see almost all my history gone, as I do not recall seeing any post stating that SR was in the process of implementing this feature.<br /><br />So, anybody else missing a big chunk of their transaction history?<br /><br />Any SR admins out there know anything about this?<br /><br />Help please!&nbsp; :o<br />

				Yeah I&#039;m missing plenty as well but the purchasing stats are what a vendor can see and not ourtransaction histories. <br />All of my purchasing stats are accurate and the removed older transactions are showing in the count.

				But this could be a good thing.. I&#039;d hate to look back at the last 2-3 months of transactions and think &quot;shit have I used that much?&quot;, or &quot;shit I I spent that much money?&quot;

				Ok I see.&nbsp; As long as I am receiving credit for good finalized transactions I&#039;m happy.<br />You know the one among many great things about this site is despite having so many choices my usage has stayed at or slightly below what it was before I found this place. Still wish I wasn&#039;t spending the $<br />Thanks Neville for pointing that out.<br /><br />T
