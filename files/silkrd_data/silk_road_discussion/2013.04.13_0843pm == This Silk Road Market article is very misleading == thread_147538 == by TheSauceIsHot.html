				Topic states that they will bring you access to Silk Road Market from any browser...<br /><br /><br />*CLEARNET*<br />http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/secpoint-will-allow-you-to-access-the-secretive-silk-road-black-market-from-any-browser/<br /><br />Oh, read article and it&#039;s not Silk Road at all.&nbsp; I got to appreciate all the extra steps that Silk Road has taken to protect us.&nbsp; Sounds like this site is shooting for all the no brainers.

				Thank you for this informative and important article.&nbsp; I just bought a vendor account.&nbsp; Sounds like lots of traffic will be coming soon.&nbsp; A large wave of people who don&#039;t want to use TOR.&nbsp; You can already use .to proxy sites to get here without TOR.&nbsp; Bit this will allow the truly lazy and reckless to join us here.&nbsp; :-)<br />

				lol, astor!&nbsp; That&#039;s funny... you&#039;re right though, I didn&#039;t even think of that interpretation at first.&nbsp; It would make the sentence actually sort of work though, wouldn&#039;t it :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t have much respect for TechCrunch, frankly (and certainly none for the guys behind the site).&nbsp; TechCrunch is so-so.&nbsp; And Slashdot is just... I mean do they even have an editor anymore?&nbsp; Jesus.<br /><br />Ars Technica&#039;s the only one I read these days where I don&#039;t immediately look at the comments just to find out what the article *should* have said.&nbsp; Nothin&#039; but respect for Ars.&nbsp; They sure do hire the right people.

				If they did use technology similar to torrents, people get tracked downloading data all the time.&nbsp; Anyways, I just wanted to highlight this article because it just seemed ridiculous.&nbsp; You CAN already access SRM and .onion on any browser already.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that most of us choose not to.&nbsp; There are guidelines setup for our protection.&nbsp; Why try to bypass them just to be lazy?

				What a silly article and &#039;company&#039;. Hopefully a hoax. &quot;We use &#039;The Pirate Bay&#039; for security&quot; just approaches the realm of absurdity.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a site at all. The wording of the techcrunch article is most peculiar and the site itself doesn&#039;t load without Javascript. An attempt by one of the dumber LE agencies to make bold claims of interception or attempt an exploit perhaps. Or maybe they&#039;re just dumb fucks. The conclusion is the same: avoid!

				I agree with Pine, stay the F*** away.<br /><br />Even the site mentioned above secpoint.launchrock.com/&nbsp; wants to run at least five script attempts. <br /><br />not going on that site as curious as i am :P.
