				your fucked, thats that. but do not worry, the money is expendable. SR is NOT! we lost tens of thousands of dollars,but all that matters is will we be able to move past this and will the community survive? all of our coins are gone and if not, great! but unless you had a backup address there is no chance in hell, and even with one there is still almost no chance. When a server is unplugged, backup plans do nothing. We hope you will make it through this even with your loss. we lost alot but are fortunate enough to move on, if you can survive, then forget it and focus on helping this community thrive again. Stay safe, and continue on to the next platform. If you are not in jail, be grateful because alot of people have pending orders which the FBI can read clear as day in most cases. But most buyers can sit in relax, most vendors have to take off or at the least clean everything they own in the event of a raid. This is stressful to say the least. Coin is insignificant at this time.

Thankfully nothing like that is going to happen to me, but the shutting down of SR is going to ruin way more lives than it supposedly &quot;saves&quot; God bless america

				I would just plan on not seeing it again, and if you do consider yourself lucky. I lost a shit ton of coins too, an amount that I won&#039;t specific because typing out it&#039;s many digits makes me want to cry... but oh well.
