				Hi everyone,<br /><br />New here. Just made my first purchase and the vendor wants me to finalize before shipment. I&#039;m okay with that since the order is small, but when I go to the orders page, I am not able to click on finalizeâ€”instead, hovering over says the option is available in 2 days.<br /><br />Vendor tells me he&#039;s not seen this before. Any ideas?

				Because the vendor account is new. Vendors are not allowed to ask for FE at all until they have been a vendor for X days or have X amount of sales.<br /><br />I don&#039;t recall the numbers.<br />

				Wow, a noob vendor asking a noob buyer to FE ... he&#039;s not allowed to ask until he receives 35 feedback posts. <br /><br />What are you looking for? We can probably recommend someone who wont make you FE.
