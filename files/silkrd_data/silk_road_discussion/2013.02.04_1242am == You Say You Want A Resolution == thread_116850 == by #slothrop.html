				I kind of do, I think, but I don&#039;t know. What I do know is this: the vendor I&#039;m waiting on is domestic, it&#039;s been ten days since my order was supposedly shipped, many others have been having problems with this vendor, and said vendor isn&#039;t responding to or even reading the two messages I&#039;ve sent. I&#039;m hesitant to put any more money into my wallet until this gets resolved, but things move fast on SR and I&#039;m watching other listings get bought out. On the other hand I&#039;m not opposed to giving this guy the benefit of the doubt, and I don&#039;t want my stats to suffer. I&#039;ve read the other &quot;What do I do in this situation?&quot; threads, so I know a little bit about how it works, but I don&#039;t know if I should hold off until I&#039;m on the cusp of auto-finalize or just try to get the whole situation over with.<br />

				If you hit resolve you can offer to add more days,&nbsp; if you think it may be coming then offer the vendor another 7-10 days through resolution and see what happens

				How long has it been since you messaged the vendor?<br />What carrier and shipping options does the vendor use?<br /><br />If you have the money I wouldn&#039;t sweat making another order while you wait. Use a different vendor of course.

I think he&#039;s swamped is part of it. He&#039;s using USPS for a USA to USA shipment, and it&#039;s been 10 or 11 days. I suppose I can wait till the end of the week before the auto-finalize runs out. Thanks.

				Was it domestic priority mail. If other people are having problems and is ignoring you than you could request a resolution.<br /><br />Since you used escrow you should be safe to wait till tomorrow and see if it comes. We are coming out of a weekend so that might cause a delay also. <br /><br />I understand you want to see how things resolve before you risk more money. You should be ok sending money into your wallet and be ready when you feel sure you are not out money. <br /><br />If you decide it is not worth further risk you can always pull coins out of your Sr wallet. Better to have coin and be ready to go just in case you see something you don&#039;t want to missout on.<br /><br />Hope you either get your order or your coin back. <br /><br />Good luck and let us know how you make out.&nbsp;

				Idk. It&#039;s cimicon. I was trying to be nice, but there&#039;s really no reason. I suppose it&#039;s better for the community to share this kind of information.
