				It&#039;s the same.<br /><br />Pills are a different matter because they contain such a variable amount of MDMA and can have so many different additives. But they generally used to be better, usually contained actual MDMA and more of it along with things like MDA. Lots of MDMA and definitely MDA are too expensive now when you can just use some RC and caffeine.

But if you look at reports and studies most show that pills contain bollocks now which wasn&#039;t so much the case in the past, and MDA wasn&#039;t uncommon which is why people had &#039;trippy&#039; or different experiences at times. As well as what you say, people also like to talk up past experiences, and the past in general a lot too.

So surely if there is a difference, it&#039;s because of the use of&nbsp; piperanol. It was always the sassafras route back in the day. But that&#039;s probably bollocks, the end result of the chemical structure of MDMA is still the same. MDMA is MDMA etc.<br /><br />Like smokeweed420 said, the reason for this continuously regurgitated question is more to do with simple burnout. Or familiarity. I know that&#039;s how it is with me. I still love MDMA (even though I can no longer use it due to SSRI&#039;s :( ), but it&#039;s just not the same. It is so set and setting dependent, and I can rarely find the right combination. I think that&#039;s down to my age. Most of my friends have given up. SO I often find myself doing it alone as they get off on other things. Alcohol/coke mostly. I end up talking to randoms, but they also seem to be on other things, or more probably wonder who the hell this old tosser is talking to them acting all young like. The older ones probably think I&#039;m some dealer moving in on their territory. So Increasingly, I&#039;m the sad old twat on the dancefloor that I always used to laugh at. Shit innit?<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to be a psychologist to see some of the causes of my depression do you? :)

These Smarties felt a lot more like old &#039;old school&#039; pills than did the White Speakers. The smarties made me much more extrovert, energetic etc. whereas the Speakers gave me a kind of a chilled introverted /contentmenteuphoria and they did the same thing to my girlfriend who was rolling for the first time ever in her life.<br /><br />I think it is likely that the pills are different and perhaps the Holy Grail which the old school crowd seek (and by old school I mean early 90&#039;s, not early 2000&#039;s), is infact a cocktail of drugs including MDMA. Probably MDA content in the good old fashioned pills is what is missing in the modern day equivalents.

Pills and speed went hand in hand back in the 90&#039;s. In the UK certainly And we are talking proper speed, not the shit you get now.&nbsp; Jarvis had it right when he sang he was &quot;sorted out for E&#039;s and wizz.&quot; It would have been rude to argue.<br /><br />Have to agree with you about the speakers Gus. I was well twatted. In a nice floppy sort of way as you describe perfectly. I never felt like hugging anything though. But I certainly talked shit. Complete shit. Most of which I instantly forgot about.<br /><br />And no, I don&#039;t want a debate on old school speed vs recent shite. There is no debate. :) I had some really nice phet stashed away from about 14 years ago I had forgotten about, that I was pleased to discover last year. I won&#039;t tell you where I hid it though. Not clever. Anyway, one pissed up night with little else to try, we broke into it, just to test it out. Aww man, it all came back. Even though I was so much older as was the speed! It still took me right up there again and we were kings for a night again. Contrast that to most of the times I&#039;ve tried recent speed, and all I get is an edgy, paranoid, fidgety mix that keeps me awake. Though I did have some nice stuff about 6 years ago, so I&#039;m sure it is out there somewhere. Just not in any abundance.

There&#039;s also the chance that the stereochemical configuration might have changet, that would alter effects quite a bit. <br /><br />PMK used to come from China, it was banned 2002 or 2003, resulted in a MDMA drought and the dutch picked up another route. <br />There&#039;s detailed statistics about that time period (well all timeperiods since ca. 1995) that show this.

There&#039;s even a newer study that looked at how the high of pills with different active adulterants changed. <br /><br />When I started, there were only pills. MDMA was extremely rare. Sometimes when you got very very lucky, you could buy a cap and the crystals always looked like transparent glass. All the brown stuff came later. Chemists to lazy too wash now? :P Don&#039;t want to advertise or anything, but OldAmsterdam claims he has MDMA made from China PMK-oil. And there is a picture from a user. That&#039;s what all mdma used to look. Now it&#039;s green :)<br /><br />edit: borrowed from 3jane thread: http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=7fc589e7e7c3c253cfe07883f776297e.jpg<br />This fits even better. I had a big break during that time and when I was back I couldn&#039;t believe that mdma crystals can be brown.

After a long enough break it will hit you like a train. Shouldn&#039;t be a problem with SSRIs. Mostly dopaminergic, as it should be. Recommended to everyone who remembers the old shit that could almost replace an E. The other guys can get FireUK speed :P

Was more of a cultural thing, everyone wanted to try and you met a diversity of people all having fun together on mdma. Just that vibe alone was priceless. It was everywhere, I could go on Parties/Raves alone and 1h in I had 10 new best friends :) Won&#039;t happen again I fear, but I&#039;m glad I was there. If I go out now, half the people are on 20 weird RCs combined with weed, alcohol, real drugs. All the mdma &quot;we are one big family&quot; feeling went away. There&#039;s nice and kind people everywhere, but during the mdma boom years, wherever you went you could find a core group of people you could roll with. That core stuck together and took care of each other, people might disconnect for hours, but always came back together, this family thing is gone now. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=44918.msg480055#msg480055">Quote from: chrispi on September 22, 2012, 02:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">not better than today, just different, nobodys tryin to be better than anybody else, its not a competition, its just a question.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Agree, it just happened that so many different people came together enjoying parties, a boom like so many others.

Every time one guy/gal was doing pills for week(end)s on end without breaks, there was suddenly an MDA pill and it got all tripy.&nbsp; Imho there was a lot of too much mdma, without necessary recovery involved. I was guilty of that too. <br /><br />Ah, good memories, best thread I have read in a while 8)

The prices went down for a completely different reason to what you are saying and it doesn&#039;t even take a firm grasp of economics to understand. Like I said, just old bastards trying to make out like they are the kings of drugs and the &quot;young&#039;uns just don&#039;t know how good it was when we are young&quot;. Well yano what I hear instead of that? The following - &quot;Blah, blah, bullshit, bullshit, do I know what I am saying? No do I fuck. Am I trying to sound cool and &#039;Super-cool-and-old-school&#039;? Yes I am&quot;.

				@musflix...Thanks for the tip about Boymastrer, I&#039;ll go check them out :)<br /><br />Glad you can empathize mate. And like you, I&#039;m happy as fuck that I lived through those times and came out the other side. Quite shocked still to be here actually. I still find the old atmosphere at festivals and psytrance events, even though I think the music is, erm, lacking somewhat, the vibe is still good. But other than that, the atmosphere at so many clubs these days can be a bit unpredictable due to so many drug combinations at play as you highlight. It was a magical period of time. We lived through it. Lucky us eh? Move on and wait for the next time :)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=44918.msg481140#msg481140">Quote from: Limetless on September 23, 2012, 05:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...

Unless someone does a side by side full chemical analysis, we will probably never know. Dunno about you but I have an open mind - which is surprising given all the chemicals I&#039;ve thrown at it. But I do have the benefit of having actually sampled the various era&#039;s of MDMA of which we speak. I&#039;m not convinced one way or another to be fair. But I stand by my thought that after the first 10 or so times, the initial wonder is dulled somewhat. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I still love MD. It&#039;s still my go to drug of choice....when I&#039;m not on fuckin SSRI&#039;s that is. Bummer. It&#039;s enough to make a fella depressed it really is. <br /><br />I do know of some folks in California who use MDMA as a form of therapy, and they rarely use any of the new stuff. They have all sorts of shit stashed from back in the day, and I believe they have their own chemist who sources their own precursors anyway. Make of that what you will.<br /><br />Anyway, real ale. You ever had Watney&#039;s Red Barrel from back in the day? Party 4&#039;s/7&#039;s? That was real ale that was ;)
