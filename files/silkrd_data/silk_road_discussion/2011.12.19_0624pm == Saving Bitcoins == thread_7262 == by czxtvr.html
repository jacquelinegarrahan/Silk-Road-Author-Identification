				Is it a good idea to save bitcoins in my SR account and spend as needed? Or should I only purchase bitcoins when i&#039;m about to make a purchase?

				The exchange rate has been pretty stable recently so it&#039;s not so risky to have a stash of bitcoins in your account, however you never know when it might drop and you could lose some money so it&#039;s easier to just buy them as need imo.

				I would typically only buy bitcoins right before making a purchase.<br /><br />But it also depends if BTC values are going up or down. For example, in the past 30 days BTC values have gone up 63%, from about $2.15 to over $3.50.<br /><br />http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg30zigHourlyztgTzm1g10zm2g25zv<br /><br />That&#039;s great for buyers and vendors who&#039;ve had BTC sitting in their accounts for a month, because buyers can buy more product than they could a month ago, and vendors get more cash for product they&#039;ve already sold. A vendor who correctly predicts that BTC is going much higher could make many times more money on their sales.<br /><br />But with a rise in value like that, the price may drop down again, you never know really. You could buy a bunch of coin at $3.50 and hold onto it, and later it could be worth only $2.50 and you&#039;d have to buy more coin to purchase the product you wanted.<br /><br />However, if you buy coin right before a purchase, it can take time (if you&#039;re moving money to Dwolla then to an exchange then to SR). You could keep money on an exchange (if you think it&#039;s safe). There are also people on SR who will sell BTC quickly, although they often charge a big % of the value or large overhead, and many build up a good reputation and then run off with a lot of money.<br /><br />Also if you don&#039;t like to wait, it looks like Dwolla now has a thing called Instant. I guess it&#039;s like a $500 line of credit:<br />http://blog.dwolla.com/its-instant/<br /><br />It costs $3/month and there&#039;s a $5 late fee. It sounds like you can deposit money and have it immediately show up in your Dwolla account (rather than 3 days later or so) which you could then deposit at an exchange and buy coin. I think you can get up to $500 and then pay it back in a month, like a credit card (that costs $3/month to use).<br /><br />..and it looks Instant has been disabled due to overwhelming demand:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7082<br /><br />Maybe that&#039;s why the BTC price has jumped to $3.50+?
