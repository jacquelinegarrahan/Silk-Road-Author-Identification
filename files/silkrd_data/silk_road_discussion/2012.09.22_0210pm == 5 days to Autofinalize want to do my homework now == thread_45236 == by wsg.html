				So I have a pending order from a vendor I have bought from once before, they currently have none of the product that I bought listed so I think supply is low.&nbsp; I know that I am premature with worrying so I just wont worry.<br />&nbsp;My question has to do with the 5 day count. I don&#039;t have access to SR daily as I am working away from my computer. In the vendor profile I was warned that shipping could exceed the 17 days and so far from what I have read.<br />If going beyond 17 days do not let the order auto FE........which I wont<br />I don&#039;t want to put this into resolution yet as there still is 5 days which to just have another normal transaction (3 I get mail)<br /><br />this is now Saturday morning&nbsp; does the 17 days work on a calendar or a clock&nbsp; &nbsp;should I check to see days remaining at 9pm tonight and base the time remaining on this number?<br />I think I read that &quot;protocol&quot; would be to add more time( with vendors agreement)<br />&nbsp;7 days is normally the max?<br />The vendors latest reviews have been mixed but up till lately have been very good<br />Does the 7 days get added to the 17 or just start a new clock when and if the vendor accepts the extension.<br /><br />Just wanted to get some knowledge before sending the vendor a note so they understand that I am just in a time crunch for the auto finalization date but would like to extend the time while I am near a computer without affecting my credibility or stats<br />

				<br />abit more information <br />PLEASE UNDERSTAND I AM NOT FREAKING OUT OR PANICKING JUST TRYING TO LEARN AS I GO.... I CAN BE PATIENT AND WILL BE&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Below are some of the resent feedback and it just seems strange that people are not receiving packages at the same time that the vendor removes listing for this product. I hope i get my product but in this situation a 50% refund seems low for a Vendor with no current listing to <br />offer more product<br />!!!Some feedback edited to remove unnecessary info!!!<br /><br />never arrived but seller gave refund so im good &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order came OK, perfect packaging<br />4 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customs has the package.<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didnt arrive but got 50% refund. Thanks anyway, peace! <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FE trusted vendor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave feedback here <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great stuff, fast delivery! <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item never arrived, got 50% refund,

				Its seems that you need to be talking to your vendor and not the forum. You can resolve and ask for more days right now, but contact your vendor first and see whats up, agree in a new day limit with him before refund. If you actually receive the order after refund, send him the money back.

				I plan on contacting them Monday if it isn&#039;t in the mail, as right now I am still within a comfortable time zone I just want to understand better if there is an issue as i will have no time after the weekend....If I was the vendor I would want my customer to wait a fair time before going to the next step(asking for resolution) and I do not feel I am at that point yet.

				resolution is not automatically like you asking for a refund or anything.<br /><br />if you arent gonna have access when its close to auto-fin then just hit resolve now and you can ask for extra days to wait. dont let it a-f<br /><br />just msg the vendor explaining you wanted to make sure there was additional time since you are still waiting for the order to arrive
