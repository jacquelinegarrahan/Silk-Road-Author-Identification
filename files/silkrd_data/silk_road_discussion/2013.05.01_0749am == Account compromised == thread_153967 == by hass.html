				Haven&#039;t been around for a while and logged in to find that I have to unlock my pin. Upon further investigation this has happened because someone has guessed at it 5 times and it&#039;s been locked. Does this have any relationship with the current attacks on the site? Because I browsed a couple of pages and seen no threads on it. Additionally, whoever gained access to my account, why didn&#039;t they change the log in password?&nbsp;

				They probably logged in, weren&#039;t able to guess your PIN, and decided to logout hoping you wouldn&#039;t change your password between now and the time that you reset your PIN (so they can give it more guesses).&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; But I highly doubt it has anything to do with the site attack.

				Thanks scout, that&#039;s bit of a relief. But how did they get it? It&#039;s a combination of two words merged into one, if you know what I mean, including numerals. Certain I haven&#039;t been phished, always enter the url from my memory.<br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ll get the password changed and hopefully no one else has the same scare haha

				I don&#039;t know how it could happen if you haven&#039;t been phished and don&#039;t use the same password on multiple sites, but it&#039;s good at least that you&#039;re back in control of your account!

				Yeah using the same username and password across even two sites is a security risk.&nbsp; Using the same user name is telling anyone that was wants to look &quot;Hey, I&#039;m here too&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t use this name on any other account anywhere and my passwords are always just a little different, like adding !$%@ or 234 to the end of my normal pass...

If so a brute force or dictionary attack would be a good means of compromising an account.

				Ouch so there was a site that looked like SR and after 1 failed login attempt says something like, account locked enter pin to unlock...?<br /><br />Anytime you see enter pin on the login screen...HUGE red flag...when I first started purchasing a few months ago I got to page from one of the hidden wiki&#039;s asking for a pin. I remembered reading something somewhere that I would never have to enter my pin outside of sending btc and making purchases on SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I came to the forums and after a few searches I realized it was a phishing attempt, honestly I didn&#039;t realize that&#039;s what phishing was, I mean it just didn&#039;t click for me until it almost happened to me...ya know? <br /><br />so live and learn and we&#039;ve all been there don&#039;t let it put you off

				Dont know if this is related, but when O logged in to a vendor account, my PIN didn&#039;t work the first four times.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m absolutely certain it was the right PIN.&nbsp; I just kept typing the same PIN and on try #5, it took it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />This was for transferring coins to a wallet.&nbsp; I was one of the first to get into the site last night when it came back.. .&nbsp; Its since been fantastic.<br /><br />Anyway.&nbsp; Just passing a related observation.<br /><br />BTW&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m transferring a few dollars to Scout tonight for his awesome patience and professionalism with everyone here.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)
