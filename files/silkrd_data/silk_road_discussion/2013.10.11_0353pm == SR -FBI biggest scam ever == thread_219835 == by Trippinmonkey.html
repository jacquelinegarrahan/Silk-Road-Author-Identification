				First chilling with the best drugs from the best vendors for free while becoming richer and richer by any payment.<br /><br />Then raise fees, then more, then the FBI all of a sudden takes over?<br /><br />Pretty weird. And what was the function of the backup wallet# ?<br /><br />And if the FBI took over, whyt dopn&#039;t they let the customers send their money out of SR?

				Maybe one of the stupidest post from someone that I actually liked in here.<br /><br />I understand when you lose money you get desperate to get it back. Or should I say to want it back. So factor in that you.... for sure lost money....then you.... with your drug of choice = this thread.<br /><br />The &quot;raise fee&quot; had very little impact on the buyer if any. It was not that high of fee at all actually.<br /><br />The &quot;back up wallet&quot; was a feature that &quot;IF&quot; DPR had to shut down Silk Road for some reason that he would then have an address for you to send whatever coins you had back to you in a wallet that was not on Silk Road. It was actually a very smart idea to out that in and it shows you from the start his intentions were good. It was not meant to work if he gets busted with his laptop open and the FBI behind him.<br /><br />I also believe there was a function at one point that if the site was not logged into my him for say 21 days...that it would shutdown and kick whatever funds you had to that address. This was said...who knows if it was true.<br /><br />So as you can see I have addressed your message line for line....and now I am on to my favorite line of yours...and maybe the stupidest thing you actually say. I am really hoping you were high when wrote this.<br /><br />So you say &quot;if&quot; the FBI took over...at this is a point...they for sure did. So if the FBI seizes something...that is an illegal operation....why would they ever let you go into your account and take out funds????? The line baffles me so much that you actually with a straight face wrote this post...but really this sentence.<br /><br />SO you think that when LE bust an illegal operation, they should give the money back to the people that were involved in the operation???? The sentence was so bad and so unreal, I can not go further on it.<br /><br /><br />But I would like to comment about the people that are in these forums crying about losing funds. It is all on you! This is just a lesson learned. There is no way 99% of you should have had any funds on the site, and those that did, are/were fully aware that they could be gone at anytime.<br /><br />Now for the most part...the big boys are not crying or complaining. Of course they may be talking about it as it sucks...but there are others that are acting like they never knew this could happen and that believe that they are &quot;owed&quot; this money...LOL.. We all knew that this site had a lot of people that appeared smart and were just the stupidest sons of bitches on the planet. I would say as a whole...we as a group have the largest range of really smart people to total idiots. And I think the idiots actually believe they are smart!<br /><br /><br />I like you tripmonkey...but I have to tell you the truth.

Yes ofcourse they should! Did your mommy never teach you to hand back a stolen cookie (even while your drool drools off of it).<br /><br />For me it&#039;s interesting. I started exploring the street, then sr, now the street. <br />I prefer SR a lot more. No waiting in the cold, being paranoid, getting fines by the police you can not afford because... guesd what?<br />They already stole it!<br />And I asked why I got the ticket, he sais thats just the rules.. he agreed he did not understand either but rules are rules and rules are bad mmmkaaaayyy.,..<br /><br />Next time I&#039;m gonna arrest him for insulting me, phew :p<br /><br />At first I thought: geeeeez SR is so expensive as a customer. Now it&#039;s, geeez NL is so cheap as a seller.<br /><br />They don&#039;t know what cocaine is here at all. Nowhere. Only what freebase caffeine is. Geez.<br /><br />I Really hope I can find a domestic coke/heroine dealer that knows what is what... what the fuck... :P<br />Then work together, and even while 1mg of ultra pure clean uncut perfect coke will be worth a billion dollars, they WILL&nbsp; get to know it.<br /><br />That was a good virmo idea. <br />But I already experienced that people prefer quantitiy over quality... Same for me. I prefer unlimited beer over black holes causes by whiuskey,<br /><br />PLEASE SOMEBODY SEND ME A CHEMIST, A BULK UNCUT DEALER NICE PERSON, REAL LSD, REAL DRUGS!<br /><br />I dont have 1,7 btc for blacvk sheep heheh... and I need to get rid of drugs...<br />I can make a fortune with coke and heroine on the streets if its good but I dont have that...<br />Valium is almost worth nothing just like kamagra and shit... actually lost money with it,...<br /><br />I do not see any problem in asking for a loan in exchange for drugs, or a specified amount of time before I have to pay it back, or I have to pay more etc,,,,<br />1.7btc is about 170 valiums. The sooner I, or actually not me but a friend, can sell again, the sooner things are going better and better andbetter.<br /><br />Maybe just try and see whats allowed and what not...
