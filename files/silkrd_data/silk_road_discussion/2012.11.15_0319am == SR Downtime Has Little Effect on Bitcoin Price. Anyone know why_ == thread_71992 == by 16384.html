				Isn&#039;t SR the majority of where Bitcoins are? Shouldn&#039;t the place a lot of Bitcoins being shut down for nearly a week have a big effect on the price of Bitcoins?

				Bitcoins are excellent at moving money across international borders no matter what they are for (even legal activities, it&#039;s much cheaper fee wise than PayPal!). Given that silk road is a piss in the ocean compared to organised crime ventures (massive baking scams, moving cash from CCs) I doubt the market would&#039;ve noticed much effect.<br /><br />Just look at how much cash gets moved around in a 10 minute bitcoin block (of course some of that will be mixing, but there are some big single transactions going on too) and you&#039;ll see how tiny SR is in the grand scheme of bitcoin.

				But what is the network volume for SR on a basis of Bitcoin days destroyed? I think it is inaccurate to measure the network volume in number of times the Bitcoins change wallets because a lot of it is one person (or program/tumbler) is sending Bitcoins to itself at another address.
