				&quot;Deepbay&quot;<br />These idiots are using cookie-cutter PHP templates, most likely wordpress.<br />Zero information on their setup. Just because they are &quot;in europe&quot; doesn&#039;t mean shit since the feds can easily close down CIS/Russian and other Eastern Euro fraud forums as they have before. I expect this site to be hacked out of existence quite soon as soon as antichat.ru and Xakepy find out about it and want some free bitcoins. I haven&#039;t noticed any CSRF tokens either, appears vuln. I&#039;m on a phone and can&#039;t really check.<br /><br />&quot;BMR - Black market Reloaded&quot;<br />The guy who runs it is well known and there&#039;s literally an Encyclopedia Dramatica page with his picture on it. I expect him to own &quot;Deepbay&quot; pretty quick as he an avid amateur hacker and spammer and has been spamming the forums here for ages.<br /><br />&quot;SHEEP MARKET&quot; is using Twitter Bootstrap. They aren&#039;t at all taking this seriously. Anybody using a fucking framework to run their illegal site is dumber than DPR ordering dozens of fake IDs to his house. Seriously, it&#039;s not brain surgery to write a small python or haskell web app. Keep a lookout for Twitter Bootstrap patches, and run diff on them to see what they changed. There&#039;s the exploit, now pwn this server before the admin get&#039;s a chance to update and install your backdoors. <br /><br />Any others?<br />I&#039;m interested in creating a Canada only site. Canada vendors where are you going? <br /><br /><br /><br />

				If anybody was around 4chan circa 2008, you know exactly who runs BMR. Remember when it launched and it had highly illegal CP for escrow?? Gee who could that be. The same guy who shut down his spam service and failed CP board and told everybody he was working on a huge new project that would make him &#039;millions&#039;, and next day BMR starts. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think he will scam anybody, just he&#039;s pretty well known to still be running that site considering he&#039;s the last one standing and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty of DEA money left to go after other online markets. Either way, it&#039;s yet another market that deals with the US.. something I want to avoid and make a Canada only market, then expand to EU. Let somebody insane with a death wish run the American markets. <br /><br />
