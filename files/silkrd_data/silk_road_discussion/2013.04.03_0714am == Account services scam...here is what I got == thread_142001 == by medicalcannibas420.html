				ACOUNTSERVlCES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morning,<br /><br />We are happy to announce that Silk Road will be upgrading it&#039;s servers and infrastructure to allow faster access for our vendors and buyers alike. We will be adding several new workstations and backup storage over the next few days. Our staff and development team are aware that the site has been slow the past few weeks, and this is due to the large influx of traffic and transactions that occur on a daily basis. We have decided to upgrade our system in order to provide a speedier experience! Security, privacy, and efficiency is paramount to our community and we will be performing migrations and adding hardware. These upgrades will not cause any significant downtime as the first phase of our maintenance was implemented early last week. TOR is slow, but we are committed to making the main SR site as smooth as can be. Our engineers work around the clock to ensure that the hiccups associated with high traffic are absolutely minimal.<br /><br />These upgrades will incur a significant cost to our Network Team. We are requesting our vendors to contribute 0.50 BTC as Account Servicing dues.<br /><br />We rely on our strong community of vendors to keep our system afloat, and are grateful for your help in making Silk Road THE leading site in it&#039;s field.<br /><br />We kindly request you send your 0.5 BTC dues to our Vendor Servicing Account:<br />1A1LSAMZrMWVFFUW6caopQP3MR7ZyzL8ww<br /><br />We are grateful for your assistance and patience during the upcoming maintenance period and are proud that our Vendors are integral to our development.<br /><br />Thank You,<br />SR Account Services

				Sad. I doubt that was a typo spelling &quot;Account&quot; as &quot;Acount&quot;. Either the system doesn&#039;t let them register with the word &quot;ACCOUNT&quot; in the username, so they figure dropping a &quot;C&quot; will be inconspicuous. <br />At first glance I read it as &quot;Account&quot; as well (maybe because it&#039;s in all caps). <br />I seriously hope this scam doesn&#039;t make what the investment guy did (if it&#039;s a different person). Why don&#039;t these guys put their creativity to use and EARN money? Fuck, they can even sell drugs here if they want and become rich. Why resort to scamming?
