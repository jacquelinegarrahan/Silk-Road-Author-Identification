				So yesterday I sent a little over 8 BtC to my account on SR to the address that SR provides after requesting a new address. Blockchain shows the BtC as received and shows up to 40 confirmations while I wait for the funds to show up on my SR account. Many, many hours pass as I wait for the funds to show up on SR before I decide to check blockchain again. This time blockchain shows my BtC having been withdrawn from that address to some other address!!!<br /><br />What do I do SR? :S

				That withdrawal should be SR&#039;s tumbler, don&#039;t worry. You will probably see the coins in your account very soon. And if not, you can contact support, but most likely you ll get the coins before they respond to you.

				SR&#039;s tumbler, really? I sure hope so. It just feels like someone straight up robbed me. Guess I&#039;ve never been hit by this tumbler in any previous deposits.<br /><br />It&#039;s been nearly 24 hours since the deposit. I&#039;ve never had it take this long before. &gt;.&lt; I&#039;ve already messaged support so I guess I&#039;ll check back in a few hours.

				It is just the built-in coin tumbler - no need to worry.&nbsp; However, definitely contact support as they may need to push it through manually to your account.

				Okay I&#039;m glad to hear I&#039;m not the only one. Didn&#039;t want to start a new thread because of this as I see a loooot of them already.<br /><br />My transaction was only 2.5 BTC but it&#039;s been well over 24 hours now so I was getting a bit worried. But I am contacting customer support as we speak! Thanks scout!

				I&#039;m sorry that I still don&#039;t have an update about these issues.&nbsp; I sent DPR a message this morning to let him know what was going on, and I still hold out hope that he&#039;ll respond or be able to fix the issue.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also sent a message to the other mod, samesamebutdifferent, to see if he has heard anything.

				I am in the same boat.&nbsp; Sent 10 bitcoins to my SR acct early yesterday morning.&nbsp; After a few hours and nothing, I checked blockchain which showed it had been sent.&nbsp; I waited some more, checked blockchain again, which showed it had 30 confirmations.&nbsp; After about six hours, I sent a message to SR Support.&nbsp; It has been almost 16 hours and they have yet to even read it.&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; <br /><br />I am sure they will get it sorted out eventually, but waiting sure sucks.&nbsp; It does help to know that I&#039;m not the only one experiencing this, though.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Same here, waiting going on 3 days for coins, never waited over 4 hours previous. <br /><br />What worries me is no response to anybody on this by SR admin or DPR.

				Good point, scout.&nbsp; I assumed that the setting for a sent message showing as having been read would be the same sitewide.&nbsp; I am also glad to hear that they have been responding to messages.&nbsp; Just hoping mine hasn&#039;t gotten lost in the heap.&nbsp; It&#039;s nerve-wracking to feel like you have money floating around in the ether.&nbsp; Not to mention that it delays the ordering of goodies.&nbsp; Patience is truly a virtue.

				I totally understand the feeling -- it&#039;s horrible worrying that your bitcoins might be missing or lost.&nbsp; Patience is a virtue, yes, but I still hope we can get this fixed ASAP!

				My issue is with a deposit. Also I did message SR support immediately after I noticed my BtC was removed from my account address on blockchain. No reply from support yet. Still marked unread.

				Yes, but they never showed up in your SR wallet --- I mean, you never looked at your account on SR and saw that the deposit had been credited.&nbsp; All you&#039;re seeing is the coin tumbler at work.
