				[There is a second indictment, that&#039;s totally overlooked.](https://ia601904.us.archive.org/1/items/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311.4.0.pdf)<br /><br />It says that **he was caught buying 1 kg cocaine from an undercover agent** (or at least personally faciliated the deal), and also, after **an emplyee of his got busted**, **he paid** the same agent **80,000 to kill him**. (That&#039;s where the &quot;I could get somebody killed for 80k in your linkcomes from). There are two killings he ordered from - thankfully fake - hitmen.

				Also this is fucked up. Looks like SR Staff was a vendor as it states the Kilo was sent to the employees house who was then arrested in which then DPR had to try and get killed for $80k which turned out to be an UC.<br /><br />My question is can cops send 1k of coke? That&#039;s nuts<br /><br /><br /><br />https://ia601904.us.archive.org/1/items/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311.4.0.pdf

				DPR is no better than the feds who took him down, drunk on power and attacking anyone who threatens it. And a cocky piece of shit too.

				Yes, this was the &quot;hit&quot; for $80k in Jan that was setup with an undercover FBI agent. After somebody pays to have you killed usually becoming a rat follows. FBI setup manual 101.

				Why would DPR want to buy 1kg of coke when he is making over $1,000,000 in commissions every month, risk free?<br />I think I know who the agent was, he was going by the username &quot;nob&quot; he was selling kilo quantities on a new seller account.<br />He also said he knows DPR and they are working on a deal. When he opened his seller account, he actually put up his own picture, he had a hat on and a mustache. He looked like a cop to me, I outed him in the vendor forum right away. One guy got burned, I&#039;ll do a search for the post and update the post.<br /><br />UPDATE: I found the thread:&nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120169.0<br />
