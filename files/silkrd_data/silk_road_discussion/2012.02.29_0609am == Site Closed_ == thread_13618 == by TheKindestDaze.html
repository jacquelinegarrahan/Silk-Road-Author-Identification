				I hate to be &#039;that&#039; guy, but just a thought....<br /><br />Why is SR tweaking the production site?<br /><br />Surely a standard set of environments could be setup like Dev -&gt; Testing/Staging -&gt; Production.<br /><br />Dev of new features and bug fixes are all coded in dev.<br />Regression, functionality, security and performance are done in the Testing/Staging Environment.<br />Finally, it&#039;s promoted to production with minimal (less than 15 mins, sometimes no) downtime.<br /><br />I don&#039;t need to know and I think it would be bad for the SR guys to disclose a lot about their current setup, but this is just an idea, (coming from an IT professional).<br /><br />PM me with questions if you&#039;d like.<br /><br />~CDaley

				All I thought when I saw the Road may be closed was THANK GOODNESS I just got a g of Tonys dope a few days ago, would have hated to miss out on that opportunity. (and I still have enough to hold me over for a little while :) thankfully I will hopefully still get to try those pebbles too now)<br /><br />Why is SR tweaking the site? Have you seen how many changes have been implemented recently... Still VERY freaky. The Road CLOSED, hate to even imagine.<br /><br />you are talking about DPR who freaking switched the URL to a new one without even giving the mods a heads up! Talk about paranoia. <br /><br />I am just thankful he has started coming to the forum asking for opinion regard important changes that are being made recently.

				lol drpvmd, its not like he changed the url again without giving anyone a heads up first!<br /><br />the site maintenance page is a fairly new addition that you should appreciate. in the past you used to just not be able to access the page and had no idea what was going on. at least now you get updates and now its just being worked on. <br /><br />still frustrating. but it came back on long enough a night ago that I was able to order the pebbles, so thats all that really matters :)

Or is that not legally possible or could DPR make that impossible. Or would they just close the site and that would it case closed.??.
