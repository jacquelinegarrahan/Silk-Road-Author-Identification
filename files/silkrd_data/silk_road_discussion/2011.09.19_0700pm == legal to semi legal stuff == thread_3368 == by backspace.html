				I want to do a couple legal to semi legal transactions on here.<br />What is the market for legal to mostly legal stuff? basically I just want to sell a couple 500g sealed tubs of nootropics (piracetam) and an ar.drone all below market value, maybe a little more after that if i can think of anything else. what do you think? Would you feel more inclined to trust a new seller if the product was legal to semi-legal? The reason I write semi-legal is because the piracetam has a stimulant in it and was banned last year, I bought up like 10 500g tubs that day at a major discount.<br /><br />I hope this is okay in the gen forum, if it isn&#039;t just let me know and I will try to sort out my posts better in the future.

				Hey I would be very interested. I&#039;ve been looking for piracetam for a long time. Can&#039;t get it shipped to Aus. <br />Tell me if you still have some.

				I sell nootropic supplements, the market is alright but then again I don&#039;t really do all that much promotion apart from my signature on these forums. You might be able to sell the piracetam tubs, but despite its increasingly &#039;grey&#039; status I&#039;d imagine you can still get it on the &#039;shallow web&#039; in most places. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The reason I write semi-legal is because the piracetam has a stimulant in it and was banned last year, I bought up like 10 500g tubs that day at a major discount.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What do you mean by this? If it contains an illegal stimulant then it is not pure piracetam, I have never heard of this in years of taking it. <br />Also, it was not &#039;banned&#039; last year, the FDA sent letters to a couple of suppliers (might have been just one) requesting they cease selling piracetam because according to the FDA definition it&#039;s not a &#039;dietary supplement&#039;. It&#039;s still availible, it&#039;s just slightly more expensive than it used to be.
