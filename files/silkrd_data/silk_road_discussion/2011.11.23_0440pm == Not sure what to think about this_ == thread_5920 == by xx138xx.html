				I was trying to make my first purchase on SR. I put in the order. I come back next day and have two messages. One is from the seller with my tracking # and a short note basically confirming when they shipped etc. Then right after that message was sent, SR sends me a message saying the seller canceled my order. The BC were refunded so no complaints there. <br /><br />My question is what&#039;s the deal here? I could understand a sell being canceled because I&#039;m a new buyer but the tracking # in the first message works and the package arrived at the distro center. Could the refund be a sine it got intercepted already and the seller realized this or what? I&#039;m basically asking because if the stuff isn&#039;t coming then I need to find some more lol

				Ask the seller directly. It looks to me that he canceled an order by mistake. Be sure to pay him, when you receive you goods!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Bob

				Lets be honest, he sold the drugs to a real life friend or decided to go nuts over the US celebrated Thanks Giving weekend with a hot chick. Just a guess. What a douche. Gotta love Silk Road for escrow giving coins back without any issue. Hope your next purchase works out better man!<br /><br />-RI

				Just wait a few days, if the drugs come, pay the vendor, if they don&#039;t, well you didn&#039;t lose any money so no harm no foul
