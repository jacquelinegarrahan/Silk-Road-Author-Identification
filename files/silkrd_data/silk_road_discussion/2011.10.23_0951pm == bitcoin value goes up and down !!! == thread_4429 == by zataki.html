				I have seen a lot of complaining about this, but who gives a fuck ?<br />Life is a gamble and you should learn to appreciate it.<br />I find it amusing that a lot of people are worried about the value of a bitcoin, and very few are discussing the ratio of amphetamine to - well the other thing in speed.<br />I&#039;m not bitching, just reminding that everything averages out and that someone needs to take it easy.<br />Relax, the bitcoin casino is a pretty fair game - you could count cards in blackjack, but who wants to do that boring task ?<br />Relax, life is a gamble.<br />Just a reminder.<br />Thanks.

				Well, for a week or so there, it was really taking a nosedive, and unhedged sellers paid a huge price for this...u know, waiting on buyers to finalize, watching the value of btc go from lots of money to a whole lot less...<br /><br />But in a general way, I think it&#039;s just the &#039;new currency&#039; thing, where speculaters buy and sell.&nbsp; It&#039;s just calming down now, and hopefully will stay around&nbsp; this price.&nbsp; SR has so many variables, that yeah, we have to have a little bit of moxie just to hang...but we also need some things we can count on, and the value of btc, lately, just hasn&#039;t been one of them...especially when site is down, makes people nervous...for the paranoid, it must have been horrible: all info is frightening, no info is worse ;)

				I don&#039;t see it as too much of a problem if you&#039;re buying BT to immediately transfer to your SR account and make a purchase. <br /><br />I can see sellers being pissed and people who try to get coins through mining. I&#039;m in the later boat so even though the actual prices of the products on SR don&#039;t fluctuate their BT values do wildly. One day I could get a ton of stuff and the next day nothing out of my 11-13 bitcoins that I&#039;ve mined so far.<br /><br />The market is very volatile but I think it will start to stabilize as the BT system becomes more popular. You shouldn&#039;t lose too much if you buy your BT and deposit them ASAP.

				Sure, let&#039;s just calmly watch our money quite literally disappear (or at least drop in value by half). <br /><br />I don&#039;t suppose you&#039;d be upset if someone came up to you, grabbed your wallet, and ripped up some money in it, would you zataki? Life&#039;s a gamble, ya don&#039;t know who you&#039;ll meet walking down the street.

				I dont see how folks are unaware of currency exchange practices? There is no need to lose more than 5% if you hedge, and keep orders listed in constant USD/ and if you sit on BTC in your account, and you see a slipping bitcoin market, cash out and buy USD, you just have to act like a trader. Even so, stats say that the opposite happens, if you get into BTC at 1.9 low, you go in and buy 1000, and it lifts to 4.0, you are golden if you CASH OUT&gt;

				Anybody who&#039;s lived in 3rd world countries knows this is just the way currencies operate.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t tied to precious metals anymore, so they bounce up...and they bounce down.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t care much when btc went way up, so I don&#039;t care all that much when they go way down...Again: seems to be stabilizing.
