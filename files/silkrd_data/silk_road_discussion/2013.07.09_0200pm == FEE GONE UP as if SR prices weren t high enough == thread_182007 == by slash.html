				Well it&#039;s still less than or equal to eBay&#039;s fees, so I&#039;d say then new fees are not out of line at all. eBay gets a final value fee of 10% on most categories.<br /><br />Many vendors seem to say they got no notification of the fee increase though it is claimed a message was sent to active vendors. That could&#039;ve just been a mistake; maybe it was thought the message was sent but for some reason it actually was not.

				Notice eBay is 95% big companies in China selling shit now? When they increased their fees the &quot;yard sale&quot; feel of it went away being replaced by commercial crap.<br /><br />eBay probably makes more now, but their site is nowhere near as good as they were before.
