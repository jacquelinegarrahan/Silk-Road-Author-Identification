				The cost of bitcoin is around $13 currently.<br />When I go to update my account to a vendor it say that its going to cost 36.45 bitcoins. I thought that it was only $150 to start a vendor account?

				&quot;Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee you will be granted a refund. All requests will be reviewed manually. &quot;<br />What exactly does that mean? What else can you do besides meet the requirements.<br /><br />And I have read the sellers guide, but there was no announcement that I could find about the vendor account cost rising $350.

				I think vendor fees should be sliding scale based on what you plan to sell and how of it. Also I think they are way too high.

				wow I thought I read 500 somewhere like a $500 bond that you may receive back if you are infact&nbsp; an asset to the SR community<br />I think this is a great decision. I remember when they were free and then the auctions. Things are so so much better now a days :)

				At $500 the price for a vendor account is just fine. It does eliminate alot of individuals that shouldnt be vending anyway.

				What SR could do is open a small vendor Bazaar. Escrow only which is strictly enforced. And have a max price and max quantity limit. <br /><br />This would be good for small time vendors who only get occasional product.<br /><br />Vendor fee for the SR bazaar should be $50. Flat 10% SR fee. <br /><br />

				Any word on how this bond thing affects existing vendors? Does that mean if we paid the fee previously and have a good history etc that we would then also get our fee back? Or only if you spend $500?

				Interesting. I first read about this on reddit (to my surprise), although I am a frequent visitor on these forums. Where are such news posted?<br /><br />I also have a question: <br />Your pricing now aims at &quot;big-time&quot; (as jackass2.0 calls them) vendors, yet the platform you are offering is targeted at &quot;small-time&quot; vendors. How does that fit? <br /><br />I like to buy from small vendors with low volume, they often have the better goods (that argument on reddit was really spot on btw) and you are effectively locking these vendors out. Cutting down on competition it will just get easier for scammers. There&#039;s no &quot;Big-time&quot; dealer to big too fail. <br /><br />Has anyone at SR thought this through or was this an emergency reaction during Christmas time?

A website that sells ILLEGAL drugs, and you can have them sent to your door.<br /><br />With dealers who 9 times outta&#039; 10 don&#039;t cut their product, and send it to you in a couple of days. <br /><br />If you were to ask an ordinary person if they believed a website like this existed, they would say no. <br /><br />Plus, the original $500 payment to open a vendor account, is a bond - if you are professional and don&#039;t fuck about/fuck people over, you&#039;ll get it back.<br /><br />The term &quot;spend money to make money&quot; comes in here.<br /><br />Plus, if you think it&#039;s to high, go over to BMR.. For the security that SR provides and the fact you can have a potential customer base of thousands of people, the price is pretty fucking good I must say.

				An example:<br /><br />Say I get one med really cheap. <br /><br />But I don&#039;t want to do this full time and I don&#039;t have access to any other drug, just that med/group of meds.<br /><br />Assume further that I am not greedy, I would sell that med 10tabs each, for the price you usually only get at 1000tabs.<br /><br />Imaginative me makes $2-400 max per month, which is spent on drugs. A few lucky fellows get my med at bulk prices.<br /><br />This new bill, dear Senate of SR, will kill those vendors! Fees are too high. Spiking them to avoid excess buys of scam-accounts is one (not working) thing... My views about this are known. Search my history. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=102398.msg718948#msg718948">Quote from: Slicksuit on January 11, 2013, 11:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Plus, the original $500 payment to open a vendor account, is a bond - if you are professional and don&#039;t fuck about/fuck people over, you&#039;ll get it back.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> This is such a bullshit-line (please link me to that):<br />&nbsp;<br />SR: Here is our land, who wants some?<br />Farmer: I only have $100, what can I get to sell my homegrown goods?<br />SR: nothing, go else were.<br />Monsanto: hehe! give me all of that by the sea and make it different account names.<br />SR: sure, good sir! you can get your money back whe....<br />Monsanto: getting it back haha, you&#039;re funny!!
