				Glad to see the site is back up. <br /><br />I really appreciated the updates and ETA while SR was down.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it was hectic on the other end trying to figure out the mess. <br /><br />I was curious about being able to withdraw coins.&nbsp; Currently I cannot do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this a universal restriction or is this profile specific?&nbsp; <br /><br />I was happy to hear that SR was 100% restored.&nbsp; &nbsp;For me as a vendor however, withdrawing my coins for finalized sales is a big part of everything :) <br /><br />At least for me, it is not 100% restored as of yet and I&#039;m uncomfortable shipping new orders if I don&#039;t know when I&#039;m going to be able to withdraw finalized sales.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure you guys are working hard to fix it and I might be overreacting.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have a moment, I would like an ETA if possible. <br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; :) :)
