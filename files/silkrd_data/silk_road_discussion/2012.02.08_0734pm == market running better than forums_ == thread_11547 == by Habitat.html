				is it just me, or is the market now running much better than the forums? lately, I find that I have been getting timed out much, much more here on the forums than in the actually marketplace. I mean, that&#039;s a great thing when I&#039;m browsing and whatnot, but it gets a little tedious - having to make a new identity in tor every 20 minutes or so (which also can be a good thing I guess, just tedious) when I&#039;m scrolling through the forums. <br /><br />I just wasn&#039;t sure if anyone else was having the same difficulties as me

				I&#039;ve noticed this too. I&#039;ve had no trouble connecting to SR lately (which is a great thing by the way), but I have had occasional trouble getting on the forums. Honestly, I&#039;ll take the actual site over the forums anyways. At least now I never have to worry about missing out on a purchase.

				Probably all the news about SR lately... you don&#039;t need to sign up for an account to check out the forums.<br />

				I was thinking they implemented some QoS traffic shaping to give priority to Silk Road server traffic over forum traffic.<br /><br />But for all I know they could have separate servers for them.
