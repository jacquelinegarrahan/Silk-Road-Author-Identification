Is this a hacker trying to promote his stupid stimulant? I&#039;m withdrawing all my bitcoins from SR and stopping all business, its obviously been highly compromised!<br />

				Working fine for me also.. sugarbaby, did you perhaps log in to a site other than the legitimate Silk Road at http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion? Did you access SR via the Hidden Wiki or other site? If so, you need to change your password immediately, as you may have been the victim of a phishing attempt.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				We have several mechanisms that limit the display of items.&nbsp; My guess is that you have selected an obscure country as your home country on your settings page where there is only one item shipped from and you have &quot;domestic only&quot; checked on your category page.&nbsp; Try unchecking &quot;domestic only&quot; at http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/70.&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t work, try changing your home country to &quot;undeclared&quot; on your settings page.

				I can&#039;t log onto silkroad either. And yes, I&#039;m using the correct address. My Tor browser will not connect (times out). <br /><br />This is urgent, because I have orders pending.

				All good here, and domestic does not check by default for me. Try changing your identity.

				It must be that there are no vendors from my country then. I certainly didn&#039;t change the settings myself. I can&#039;t change it back either.<br />Hopefully customer service can sort it as I wouldn&#039;t want to change my identity after building it up :(

				I can see all the listings fine, but it&#039;s been timing out a lot when trying to connect the past couple days.

				Ë†I suspect it times out quote a lot when the server is extremely busy. Maybe they are trying to get rid of some of us! :)<br /><br />Hope things go back to normal. I&#039;m sure it is that the settings are defaulted to domestic as I can reach vendors through different routes like old feedback etc.

				i&#039;ve been facing the same shit, when i logged in today with my sr seller name... there were just 4-5 items on the left site listed, but my listings were all there?! than, i logged out - cleared the cookies - deactivate javascript as well - and logged in with that short address from sr (and my sr buyer name): http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/ - worked fine...&nbsp; ::) i hope, the site ain&#039;t under attack or something... if so, i would immediately move my bc to a safer place...&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />
