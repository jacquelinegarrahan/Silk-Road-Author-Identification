				Something needs to be done. To many innocent people are getting ripped off and vendors like myself are loosing business.

I think any new vendor needs to send samples of there products to known people of the community to get &quot;checked out&quot; before they can request customers to do early finalization. <br /><br />If this continues, the SR community will suffer and it could be the down fall to as we know it, The Silk Road.<br /><br />Please, please lets all think of a workable system to prevent scams, this is getting out of control.<br /><br />On another note, I think it&#039;s the same scammers that are doing it. They just use the funds they scammed to make another sellers account to scam even more. If we can stop the profit even the slightest, we can do this.

				That shit will never fly and SR is too busy and could care less in my opinion. I remember being a new vendor. I would never give out samples. And if I did I would then know the whos and wheres. I do not want to know! People JUST NEED to do there do diligence and not be in a hurry. A fool and there btc are soon parted. My grandpa used to say that all the time.

It&#039;s as simple as requiring new users to read before signing up and as simple as finding a spot for it on the main page.

				I know admin don&#039;t wan&#039;t people to be discouraged by the first thing they are greeted with are about scams. But if it keeps going, it&#039;s only going to grow and this, in my eyes, will be Silk Roads down fall.

I know it can&#039;t be that hard. This is PHP scripting were talking about... it&#039;s not that hard to place code to notify a admin when a seller is A: getting back to back feed backs&nbsp; B: getting feed backs from the same Tor IP or C: a simple notify Admin button for suspicious activity.

				Quote: &quot;B: getting feed backs from the same Tor IP &quot; - you are misinformed, my dear friend, as to the basic premise of Tor anonymity. There is no reveal of a true re[eatable IP address when Tor clients log into a hidden service. Now - there might be a way to create secure, anonymous SR netID&#039;s....that&#039;s for another thread and I don&#039;t think people would like ti at all.&nbsp; We could go to paid digital keys for buyers. Ewwwwww////////ugghhhhh. <br /><br />I agree however that the sysadmins could do more for vendor protection beyond resolution process, when the cow is already out of the barn - and have a heuristic monitor for the things you are correctly specifying, eg, behaviors.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				At this point, there are more scam buyers than sellers. If you want to avoid being scammed as a buyer - just USE THE ESCROW SYSTEM - that&#039;s what its there for!!<br /><br />Buyers who are getting scammed deserve it for dealing out of escrow like silly monkeys. USE ESCROW!!<br /><br />Now if we can figure out how to deal with scammer buyers. Like LE that buys from you to see where you ship from, and then buy again to intercept your package before the DCN even gets scanned, and then leave you shitty feedback. <br /><br />Why don&#039;t we focus on vendor protection and have buyer feedback on here??

				When I was brand new, I gave a free 30mg roxy to the first 20 or so orders. I did it to get regulars. while I have&nbsp; a lot of regulars now, I&nbsp; think that only 1 or 2 are from the batch that I gave a freebie too (so a lot of good that did, lol). I think Nomad said (or someone) that new vendors should send their product to a 3rd party to evaluate. That won&#039;t prevent scammers, but it would prove that they at least have some product. I think that all buyers should stay within escrow with new vendors. no questions asked.&nbsp; I cant believe how many&nbsp; new vendors show up and make it a requirement to go out of escrow and a lot of buyers are doing it. <br /><br />Maybe they can afford the loss, but I wouldn&#039;t even think of going around escrow with a new vendor.<br /><br />

				I think sampling is useful, it adds credibility to new vendors, or new product. Never go out of escrow. Only finalize early if you don&#039;t mind losing that money, AND really trust the vendor. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
