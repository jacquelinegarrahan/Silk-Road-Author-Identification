				Dear all members if you will simply bookmark or if you dont like that simply enter the url in a notepad file and stash in a hidden folder, problem solved.<br />Do not trust any posting of the address anywhere.

I honestly think I got the link off Wikipedia the first time. That or The Hidden Wiki. I didn&#039;t get it from a signed message from DPR, that&#039;s for sure- I wouldn&#039;t have known who he was or how to verify it.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;m fairly certain that silkroadvb5piz3r.onion is the real address because the drugs showed up. ;) But what is a brand new user supposed to do? Unless you know and trust an SR user (I know one IRL but I&#039;m not sure I would trust him not to fuck up the URL, honestly), your only option is checking multiple sources and hoping the majority is correct.

				Good, the less places the link is in the public, the better.<br /><br />Just memorize the address, it&#039;s pretty easy.
