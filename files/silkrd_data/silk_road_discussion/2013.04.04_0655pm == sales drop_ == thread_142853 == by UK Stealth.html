				The same here.<br />I am just an ant here, but when I observe another vendors, I see the same pattern. The answer is in the BTC, but where exactly?

				As a buyer with a huge purchase history , I have to admit I am holding out big time.&nbsp; Suffering too. <br />I got the coins waiting.&nbsp; . . It&#039;s the fucking recent drop in price.&nbsp; I lost quite a bit of value in the past day.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it will go back up to $140. Soon<br /><br />Sorry guys,&nbsp; it sucks&nbsp; , but I bought my last coins at $141.44. As if.&nbsp; I got ripped and lost $40. So far on my last coin but.&nbsp; <br /><br />On a good note,&nbsp; we can&#039;t wait that much longer. :-).&nbsp; Gotta have drugs sooner or later.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				apparently this phenomenon is called hyperdeflation.&nbsp; It&#039;s where a currency is appreciating so fast that people stop spending because they believe if they hold onto it a little longer it will give them a better return.&nbsp; There&#039;s been discussions about it out on various news sites over the last few days.&nbsp; There&#039;s also that 420 thingy coming up and I&#039;ve seen a few posts where people are hanging back waiting for it.<br /><br />The good news is that most people here like Jediknight will spend eventually ;)<br /><br />and now I&#039;m over my 50 posts I really should go find something else to do rather than hang around here..&nbsp;

				I would like to see some sort of graph that looks at the price of BTC along with the # of sales on SR over a period of time.<br /><br />As an economist, I think it would be interesting as there have not been too many documented cases which study hyperdeflation. <br /><br />Anyway to get access to this sort of data?
