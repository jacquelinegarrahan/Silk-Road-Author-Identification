				Was a bit concerned by the article, till I read it was their parents that ratted them out LOL&nbsp; ;) ;),&nbsp; &nbsp;but in all seriousness stay strong kids @ 15 &amp; 17 a police caution ain&#039;t all that bad&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Brothers in court over online drugs<br />Luke Eliot, The West Australian September 28, 2012, <br /><br />Police have seized cannabis, ecstasy and speed bought from an underground website described as an &quot;eBay for drugs&quot; after two teenage brothers were allegedly caught importing the drugs to Esperance from Melbourne and Canada.<br /><br />The brothers, aged 15 and 17, were last week charged with possessing cannabis with intent to sell and supply.<br /><br />They faced further drug charges, including possession of LSD, when they appeared in Esperance Magistrate&#039;s Court on Monday.<br /><br />Police allege the pair bought the drugs through a website known as The Silk Road, which has been operating for about 18 months.<br /><br />Officers want the website identified because they want parents to be aware of their children&#039;s internet habits.<br /><br />The Silk Road employs sophisticated security measures and a digital currency that eliminates the involvement of banks.<br /><br />Users must first download a free program that masks the true identities of both the buyer and seller by &quot;bouncing&quot; communications among a network of relays operated by volunteers across the world.<br /><br />Once that software is downloaded, users can access the underground marketplace where they can search for their drugs of choice.<br /><br />Searches produce prices per weight and also include reviews of the sellers - including people whose product and service has been rated highly or poorly by users. The website includes information on how to package, handle and distribute the drugs.<br /><br />Users can also access information on how to avoid scrutiny by police and get feedback on the quality of the drugs on offer.<br /><br />Users must use a digital currency that is not regulated and difficult for law enforcement agencies to trace.<br /><br />The boys&#039; parents approached Esperance police because they were concerned at packages they were receiving through the mail.<br />Staff at the local Australia Post sorting depot had also become concerned. Detectives launched an investigation dubbed Operation Cinder and identified the source of the drugs as The Silk Road.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On a further interesting note it looks like they only busted them for possession, no writ&#039;s for intention to import a commercial level of banned narcotics, postal fraud ect; interesting much?&nbsp; &nbsp;??? ??? ???

Good point about the parents too, although here, that won&#039;t stay on their records, once 18, they have a clean slate i think, if they weren&#039;t charged.

LE are aware of the open drug dealing and supply that happens everyday on the streets of Nimbin but don&#039;t crack down because they look at it as a hard reduction type of approach and as long as no one is getting hurt they are not going to waste a lot of their energy on it.

				After reading this post i Googled Silk Road Australia and this was the first post.<br />do you think they are trying to scare us?<br /><br />Aussie cops: Silk Road TOR anonymity &#039;not guaranteed&#039;<br />We monitor Aussie buyers and sellers on Silk Road, says maritime cargo watcher.<br />Liam Tung (CSO Online (Australia)) — 26 July, 2012 09:42( 13 Comments )<br />There is no guarantee of anonymity for Australian buyers and sellers of illicit drugs on the TOR-encrypted e-commerce platform Silk Road, according to the Australian Federal Police and Australian Customers and Border Protection.<br /><br />The pair released a joint statement Wednesday pointing to the arrest of one Melbourne man who allegedly imported narcotics via Silk Road.<br /><br />“Criminals are attempting to exploit the international mail system through online networks, but the recent arrest demonstrates that we are one step ahead of them,” said AFP Manager Crime Operations Peter Sykora.<br /><br />Sykora said it was aware Silk Road was operated from an offshore location, but warned Australian users were within the reach of the AFP’s powers.<br /><br />The site can only be accessed via TOR, which masks IP address details that could otherwise be stored by an ISP and associated with a user account. Silk Road trade relies on the virtual currency BitCoin for transactions.<br /><br />Alana Sullivan, acting national of Custom’s cargo and maritime targeting branch, said it monitors Silk Road along with other illicit-drug sites and was aware of the Australian presence on Silk Road as both sellers and buyers.<br /><br />“Persons who buy or sell through online market places, on so-called ‘anonymous’ networks should understand that they are not guaranteed anonymity,” said Sullivan.<br /><br />The statement follows a recent comment by Chris McDonald, an associate professor in computer science at the University of Western Australia and Dartmouth College in the US, that the federal government has “no chance of beating” TOR encryption, The Age reported in in April.<br /><br />Law enforcement may not be able to beat TOR’s encryption. However, it did not prevent US authorities in April arresting eight men accused of operating The Farmer’s Market -- another service that used the TOR anonymiser to facilitate trade. Undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agents had infiltrated the organisation after becoming trusted buyers over several years of investigation.<br /><br />There were no Australian arrests, however the indictment pointed to funds funnelled through that operation that were sourced from Australia via Western Union.

				Finding drugs and illegal items in international mail is NOTHING NEW to the LE.<br /><br />This is just PR and media stunt.&nbsp; It may actually get the attention of the higher ranking officers to beef up the line at the customs, but it&#039;s nothing new.<br /><br />They have limited resource and no way they can open and sort through every single package.<br /><br />However, even if I only have 1% of getting intercepted at customs, I would still only stick to domestic.<br /><br />I rather pay extra for the peace of mind and avoiding my address flagged.

Only if a drug dog hits on it or it&#039;s deemed to be a suspicious letter/package, maybe due to it&#039;s country of origin or a problem found on the Custom&#039;s Declaration , will it then be x-rayed as they step up the level of the investigation until satisfied one way or the other.

In 4 years they will be an adult and can make there own judgement on buying and using different drugs.

				I&#039;m only concerned about 15 YO kids using LSD, the fact is that information is missing , instead of hiding the Drug theme and prohibit like alcohol in the beginning of the 20th century in the USA. We basically miss a culture about farmacology and drug use and abuse , we don&#039;t give kids the instrument to decide wheter it&#039;s good or not, we just tell them DON&#039;T , and off course they do it....

				If they were my parents I would disown the filthy dogs! What sort of fucking shit parents would deliberately try to ruin the lives of their own kids when it&#039;s the parents responsibility to raise their children properly and be aware of what their kids are up to? <br /><br />Australians have it rough enough when it comes to trying to get safe drugs without some idiotic minors going and drawing unnecessary attention to the most logical and safest method to reduce crime and injury that&#039;s been made in the past 100 years! It&#039;s because Australia&#039;s dictatorial fascist government has brainwashed it&#039;s citizens so much that they can sacrifice their own children on the alter of the Law God Of The Sky who I might add failed in his own responsibility with Adam and Eve and prohibition. <br /><br />If God can&#039;t keep one plant prohibited from 2 people while making it readily available, what possible chance has the Law God got at doing it with 6.5 billion people and potentially as many yet to be made drugs? <br /><br />We live in bizarre times, it is inevitable the drug war will end, it has to, but it will unfortunately take countries like Portugal to show us the way instead of Australia who just a few years ago lead the world in harm reduction, now thanks to Howard and now Labour&#039;s hard line policies we&#039;ve gone back to our Neandertholic attitude of just clogging up our prisons with drug users/vendors instead of thieves and rapists. <br /><br />It&#039;s like the fucking Twilight Zone and the moment people of significance start coming out and saying enough already there&#039;s a media blackout on the subject, yet they talk shit about Silk Road on television and in the papers so minors simply Google it and figure out how to use it! It&#039;s almost as if the government is planting the seeds of attempting to make future drug addicts in a similar fashion to when Reagan went on TV on every station at once talking about how unbelievably cheap and powerful crack is.

				Man, there is absolutely no way to control your kids. They either want to be controlled or they don&#039;t. Kids are at school 6+ hours a day, parents work 8+ hours a day...as a kid you probably see your parents when you wake up in the morning and right before you go to sleep!&nbsp; How is a person that you see for less than 2 hours a day going to have any real control over you? The child will do whatever s/he deems best. <br /><br />And as a parent: You work 40+ hours a week under some sniveling fucktard boss who jumps up your ass every 20 seconds to make ends meet, while your penis or vagina isn&#039;t getting pleased enough and your kids keep spending your savings away on bullshit. You spend 1.5 hours driving so you have around 3.5 hours of being awake after you get off work. Do you really want to spend that 3.5 hours trying find out what your kid was doing every day for the 9 hours you didn&#039;t see him or her?<br /><br />Also, I disagree with the &quot;wait until you&#039;re 18 to do all these drugs.&quot; <br /><br />NO!<br /><br />Get your retardation out BEFORE you&#039;re 18! That way you don&#039;t go to jail or get anything on your record! In my opinion, the stupidest thing I deal with right now is other 30 year olds who have never tried weed or coke and then try it and act like a complete and utter moron, or worse off, they begin a new additction in their midlife that they have no experience with and start slowly ruining everyone&#039;s life around them.&nbsp; It&#039;s like some 40 Year Old Virgin shit. <br /><br />The only thing I can say is that I&#039;m so disappointed in the parents. What fuckers. I guess they are the kind of people who think that police are the top brains of their country and that their resources are spent well and successfully.<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t know, I did every drug I could get my hands on from the period of 15-18 years old, because I know the law protects minors. It also allowed me to get fucked up by these drugs and see what they do to me before I had any real responsibility or things to take care of. So I totally disagree that someone should wait until they&#039;re some arbitrary age to get fucked up. You should choose to do things when it&#039;s right for you.

We know because the cold is a minor that it won&#039;t go on their record and nothing can be done to them except prob scare the shit out of them and maybe set them on the straight and narrow. <br />I don&#039;t agree with it but some parents think it is the only option they have to keep their kids away from drugs, obviously my parents never called the cops on me.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather get caught with drugs in Australia than the USA or EU. Just my 2 cents worth.

				Really sucks about the bust. But reading this thread, It really made me want to post&nbsp; :).<br /><br />People are saying that age really matters. In my honest opinion, I don&#039;t think it matters one bit. I think maturity is what matters. I have been a drug user since I was 12 years old. Albeit, it was marijuana use all the way until I was 14, then that&#039;s when I tried pharmaceuticals. At age 15 I tried psychedelics, and I have never looked back. I tried mushrooms twice, then tried LSD. I don&#039;t think it damaged my brain or anything. I still grew very tall and I didn&#039;t notice anything huge that was irregular about my growth. I did have an estrogen build up in my nipple that I was told was from Marijuana usage. Now I have tried plenty of psychedelics including RC&#039;s and DMT.<br /><br />But yeah, I have smoked weed since I was 12, and I&#039;d say as MUCH as I can since then. It&#039;s been everyday for awhile, every other day, etc. I even took breaks that were a month+ from all drugs when I was younger. <br /><br />It is just really strange because everybody has this conception that you have to be a certain age to use drugs. Sure, 12 years old smoking weed is something that older people frown upon. Think about it in the eyes of a 12 year old pot smoker. I just felt like smoking weed, I enjoyed doing it, and had family that enjoyed doing it also. I don&#039;t know, maybe that&#039;s why I ended up on the road in the first place&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />In conclusion, I don&#039;t feel age really matters in the drug use world. Just intelligence and maturity are the main factors here. Especially SR. If a young adult can find his way to SR, acquire BTC, and actually make a purchase and receive it, then good job and enjoy~!
