				Keeping a site running 24/7 is a real challenge, especially when it is being run by a single person, and even more so when they need to access the server via Tor (typing in SSH commands five ahead of what you see on the screen is never any fun) and are running an illegal site that isn&#039;t their full time job. Keep that in mind before bitching about down time :).

				Oh Thank god. I was wondering why it wasn&#039;t showing up. I thought something was wrong with my browser. Because i was trying some new settings, and i was able to come on the board, But then i changed some settings and i couldn&#039;t come on the board. So i thought i fucked something up. But thank you for getting it back up in a reasonable time. I know it must be a lot of stress running this whole thing. It&#039;s a dirty job, but somebody&#039;s got to do it.

				DPR what can we all do to pitch in and help out. It seems like there have been a great deal of technical difficulties with Silk Road lately. Some difficulties like bitcoins not going to outside wallets can&nbsp; drastically affect the consumer confidence in Silk Road.

I&#039;d just consider it insincere not to point out half the venom in me right now has nothing to do with you.&nbsp; For some stupid reason I give a fuck about things like sincerity.&nbsp; Not that there&#039;s any good reason to, really... but that&#039;s another matter entirely.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It&#039;s all good, some days I get all pissy as well, as long as your core points are valid. On that note I have to agree with you. There are improvements to be made, and whether we are appreciative or not there are standards that need adhered to. <br />Too many people pander when no praise is due.. five days of downtime followed by a return of service with no updates in between is hardly good reason for applause. DPR doesn&#039;t need the personal validation I&#039;m sure...

				I&#039;m very happy the forum is back. Withdrawals, yes, but as a new vendor my sales nearly stop when the forum is down. I&#039;m a slacker sometimes and can understand not getting the Forum as well set up as SR at first. It has been years though? I do hope this is a wake up call that gets improvements implemented. If I am not mistaken, DPR is getting massive income from the fees vendors pay. I would expect this to be treated like more than a part-time side job as someone above suggested this was to DPR. I do appreciate the great thing we have here and agree wholeheartedly that DPR and whatever helpers deserve great respect for making it happen as well as they have.<br /><br />The first days of the outage were very hard with lots of time wasted trying to get in. It has been pretty hard to get into the forum anyway - so when you really can&#039;t, It is hard to tell the difference. Once we had a message that the forum was down for maintenance, it was much less stressful. I do feel like we deserved earlier notice of the issue even if it would have had to be posted on SR. A tiny &quot;Forum is down but will be back pretty soon&quot; and then changed to &quot;Forum is back up :-)&quot; would have been very helpful.

Put all of your drugs around you in a ritual circle and curl up in the fetal position with a tooter, pipe, and glass of water... then just pretend you are back in the womb. If you don&#039;t remember the womb just dose generously from the circle, give it a few moments then try again.. repeat until desired results are achieved.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Seriously though, I hope next week improves for you..
