				Hi,<br /><br />Just a question to other members.<br />Is anyone else having trouble with deposits to his SR wallet?<br />I made a deposit this morning at 6 and it has been confirmed says Blockchain.info<br />But it isn&#039;t showing up in my wallet.<br /><br />It has 75 confirmations and already 66 confirmations from a transaction I guess it&#039;s SR.<br /><br />I have had trouble before a month or 2 ago.<br />But from over 200 transactions this is annoying.<br />i know it&#039;s not much, but it stays a loss after all.<br /><br />And yes, I already sent a PM to DPR on SR.<br /><br />Koelen3.

				Since you already contacted support there&#039;s nothing you can do but wait at this point.<br />Usually when this happens you just send them a message and they force it through...

				Also a bit weird:<br /><br />Bitcoin deposit which was made yesterday evening has 100 confirms almost and isn&#039;t redirected.<br />This one shows up in my wallet, but the deposit made before this one, which has been confirmed (redirected) by SR is not available.<br /><br />Koelen3.

				Something similar to me happened (out of order BTC transactions) when I did some withdrawals last night. Made 3 relatively quickly. First one is out to the network in 2minutes, next 2 still haven&#039;t been broadcast. Made another one a few hours later and it took 3 minutes. Been well over 16 hours for the 2nd and 3rd and nothing. asked support about it and they just said it can take a few hours. (While kind of ignoring my actual question asking if out of order, large delays is a normal thing or not)<br /><br />So, it&#039;s probably normal and will show up for both of us eventually.

				Well, the 2nd transaction took 3 minutes for me too.<br />It just got verified and forwarded by SR after 22 hours finally.<br /><br />My first transaction hasn&#039;t shown up though.<br />It&#039;s already 39hours that it has been forwarded by the system now.<br /><br />And you are lucky they contacted you.<br />They are just ignoring my simple 1 question of where my coins are...<br /><br />Koelen3.
