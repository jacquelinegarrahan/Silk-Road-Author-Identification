				Just seems since we had the Gawker outage, shit is particularly fast. Basically everywhere on the site. Places I used to come to expect long pauses seem sudden and quick now. <br /><br />Anyone else have a similar experience?

				Most of the time it is fast, still get those times when everyone floods the server and it becomes pretty slow. On average though, it seems it has been getting faster and faster over the last month.

				I&#039;m guessing that they did a significant hardware upgrade in anticipation of the sale, and right after the second gawker article.<br /><br />Anybody know what the registered user base is up to now?

				Yes, and lets hope it stays this way (ie. that SR upgraded their server).<br /><br />Definitely haven&#039;t found myself having to constantly click the &quot;Use a New Identity&quot; button every other minute or two and hope that Silk Road loaded.

				I&#039;ve noticed improved speed as well. I&#039;m sure SR upgraded the servers in anticipation of more traffic for last weekends promotions.
