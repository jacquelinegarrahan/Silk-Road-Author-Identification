Or would it be a message sent on the same level of agreement world wide against the policies of institutionalised racism and sexism, but in the Cyber Age of Dr King&#039;s &quot;I have A Dream&quot; speech to do with our own freedom of our bodies and minds to do with as we please, where HERE TODAY, WE ALL HAVE A DREAM, TO BE LEFT ALONE AND TO SPREAD HELP AND PARTICIPATION AS MUCH AS WE CAN IN OUR COMMUNITY AND ASSIST PEOPLE WITH ADDICTION PROBLEMS!<br /><br />That is Silk Road to me!<br /><br />Oh and sometimes dank nugz too&nbsp; :P<br /><br />PEACE AND LOVE - JWM

				Perhaps having the site and the forums flooded with masses of noob users is precisely the outcome that mr and mrs LE are going for.. We&#039;ve seen the effects of increased traffic many times over.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know a lot about the back end of TOR and whether it has any capacity limits when it comes to traffic across a single site, but I&#039;ve no doubt SR and these forums will be the first to find out..

				Either way, I don&#039;t think an influx of noobs or otherwise could bring down SR for good.&nbsp; And even if it could and does...call SR a proof of concept.&nbsp; Hidden online drug marketplaces are absolutely feasible, and so there will always be someone somewhere providing the service.&nbsp; Let&#039;s just hope DPR &#039;n &#039;em can keep this thing going indefinitely.<br /><br />If there&#039;s one thing the war on drugs has taught us since it has started--it&#039;s that the war will never be won, drugs will never be defeated.&nbsp;

				The media couldn&#039;t give a fuck if it boosts usage or not, that&#039;s not their agenda. All they care about is selling news and ratings irrespective of what impact that has, good or bad which is a subjective concept anyway. A lot of &#039;media&#039; types love their drugs the same as the next man so I doubt anyone in the back office is desperately trying to save us poor aussies from the deadly scourge of drugs by broadcasting factual and balanced news stories on the subject. The ABC &#039;should&#039; be more impartial than the other media giants owned by Murdock and co but last nights broadcast was pretty woeful. <br /><br />Aussies love their drugs and consume more per capita than many other countries, SR has opened up a more reliable and MUCH cheaper option that scoring from the usual avenues so it will continue to flourish unless the feds find a way of clamping down. Given the technology is pretty much impenetrable they will target the weak links in the chain e.g. those who take stupid risks like ordering large amounts to their home address etc but even then beyond making examples of a few hapless kids they are fighting a losing battle and they know it.<br /><br />Be smart, learn all you can re encryption and use safe drops to cut the link between you and your shipments and there is pretty much fuck all they can do. <br /><br />
