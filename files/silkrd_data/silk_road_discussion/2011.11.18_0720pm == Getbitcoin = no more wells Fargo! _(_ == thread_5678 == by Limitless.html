				Everything about BitCoins is a pain in the ass. BitCoins suck to get and then once you have them they suck to have because the value changes twice every second. Also everytime I find a good source for BitCoins it seems like it disappears. And moneypak is the worst company in the world to deal with. But aside from moneypak its hard to buy BitCoins and hide my identity. I hope that I can find another site like Silk Road that accepts a digital currency thats better than Bitcoins. Now right now I am lucky because I have arrangements worked out with other members of Silk Road so I dont pay a fee to buy BitCoins but thats another bullshit part about BitCoins. What a joke to have to pay 10% and sometimes even higher just to have an exchanger on Silk Road turn your cash into BitCoins. The lowest I have found an exchanger doing bitcoins for cash was 5% and that is getbitcoins.com but they keep shutting down thier payment methods I feel like its only a matter of time b4 they are shut down all 2gether.

I loved them sooooo much.<br /><br />I&#039;m really concerned about everyone folding too. I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s a better way without all this exchange crap? Or hell, maybe SR could run off of its own currency? I&#039;m not sure how that would work, but I have faith that there is another solution.
