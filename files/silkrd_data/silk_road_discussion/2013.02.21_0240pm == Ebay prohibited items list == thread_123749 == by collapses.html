				Huh... I&#039;ve bought items matching some of those and seen items matching others. I wonder if they were recently added to the list or if they&#039;re just not strictly enforced.

				I used to buy peyote plants, spore syringes, and secretly listed pot seeds with ease.<br /><br />Not any more in the past few years.<br /><br />but, if you frequent categories of items such as being described, and you search buyitnows, you&#039;ll be surprised at what can be purchased... if you are fast.

				Yea eBay has gone crazy with bannin some things. <br /><br />A lot of stuff you can find under different categories.<br /><br />What kind of native American art can&#039;t you sell. A friend buys Indian stuff all the time on ebay. <br /><br />But yea there is a market for a lot of stuff. Wish SR had a section for other stuff. Those could add a lot to sales and&nbsp; would give new people a good way to build stats.

				I&#039;ve sold otc diphenhydramine on eBay, and co-codamol. No problems. Not prescription items in uk, but still to be sold &quot;under the supervision of&quot; a pharmacist. <br /><br />BUT they did take down a listing for a Jorge Cervantes indoor growers bible. <br />Reason: &quot;an item that may encourage illegal activity&quot;. (incidentally, still got that if anyone is interested. Brand new latest edition. lol) <br /><br />EBay uk is all over the place is seems. Very lackluster in which rules they choose to enforce and when. (Ō_o)
