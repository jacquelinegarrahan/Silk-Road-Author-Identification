				I have been a long time buyer and am now looking to set up shop as things settle down and I save the appropriate amount of money to start in the next month.<br /><br />My major concerns are quite obviously my anonmity aswell as the abillity to be able to cover my ass if I were to ever get raided (obviously I would need to do everything I can to prevent this also). To the point where there would be no traces of SR in my life.<br /><br />Also having my connections not know who I am - in the case where they turn themselves in to LE ( For Example: Having others accept my large quantity orders, or being able to open an anonymous mail box which I am able to dump and change often)<br /><br />The items I will be selling are still up for debate, for that I will open up a thread on shipping secure as I get further into the process.<br /><br />Turning my BTC into Gold or Silver, and storing it<br /><br />Etc...<br /><br />You guys know all the appropriate steps a vendor must take to protect themselve<br /><br />Hopefully some of you have links, can offer some help, and I will even be looking to hire a consultent (My spelling sucks) as I build up the funds and get closer to opening

				99% of this stuff you should be able to find yourself here and on other forums. Mostly here though. This forum is chock full of information. Good example is on using TAILS as your only OS that you access your vendor accounts with. A link to this can even be found on the SR market page.<br /><br />If you&#039;re prepared to do some intense reading, learn everything you can. And be patient. You can probably do this.<br /><br />Having a good steady supplier of the products you want to sell is a plus, watching the market and figuring out supply and demand and finding out what products your customers want to see is also really good. But these are final steps<br /><br />I would figure out your security and shipping situation first.

				often i hear people giving tips on how to keep your pc clean etc in case you get raided. i think it&#039;s far better to focus on doing everything you can not to get raided in the first place. it&#039;s not that hard you just have to use some common sense and all the info is out there for anyone who wants to find it. yeah someone should do a write up on &#039;how to be a vendor&#039; but until someone does you&#039;re on your own because frankly to go into all aspects of vending in a thread like this is not possible

It is very possible to get raided for something not SR related, and have that show up.

				Do at least a months hard research before jumping in to anything. Better to be safe than sorry. <br /><br /><br />We shipped drugs before we came to vend here, so we knew about stealth and how to deliver anonymously but we had to learn how BTC worked and how to cash out and launder safely but we have a working system now. Took about 6 weeks to get down to a T but we are happy we could profit 30K-50K in the next year and make it look legit, while storing about 500 pound away per week in cash in case we ever need a quick get a way. (something I suggest all dealers do.)<br /><br />You could have the best security in the world but one slip up is all it takes to get caught. <br /><br /><br />ALWAYS WEAR GLOVES WHEN PACKAGING. If you become a big time vendor and LE order from you and your prints are on file, do you have a reasonable explanation to why your prints are there? If not, then you&#039;re fucked. <br /><br /><br />Other than that, enjoy vending it&#039;s good fun, also try to be careful&nbsp; :)

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Tip on wearing, you want a set of gloves which are soft and smooth as doctors glove but thicker, when your hands start to sweat you prints will show and probably leave them on the stamps, envelopes, everywhere basically, in terms of law fingerprints don&#039;t mean shit, they just help build a case, its like another piece to the puzzle. They can&#039;t put a time when you touched, or a place, or a reason. See my point? Anyway, still best don&#039;t leave them :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone in an earlier post probably the most important, you should not worry too much about what happens AFTER you get raided, cos more then likely, they will have a good reason to convict with what they already have, let alone find. You should concentrate your energy more on HOW NOT TO GET RAIDED. Then when you think you&#039;ve covered that, do some more research, and when that is done, focus on fallback strategies. <br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve already told you in the PM&#039;s before the nice people on SR are telling you. Keep reading these forums day and night, you will pick up a lot of interesting stuff and ideas.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />Meerkovo
