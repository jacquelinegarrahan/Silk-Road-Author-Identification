				Hey SilkRoaders,<br /><br />I transferred cash to mtgox nearly two weeks ago but they have yet to add it to my account saying that they have the money but they can&#039;t access the information to see who transferred what since they only get record of 200 transactions a day and on this day they received more than 200.<br /><br />As I said it has nearly been two weeks and I still don&#039;t have any progress they just keep saying to me in support that they are looking into it and are waiting for the information to come through. I&#039;m pretty pissed off as it has went on for so long now and they just keep repeating the same bullshit to me.<br /><br />Has anyone else had any similar experiences with them?

				I&#039;ve always had good luck with their help system.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to use it twice because my money didn&#039;t show up in a few hours.&nbsp; They always were able to track it down and have it fixed within 24 hours.&nbsp; Never heard of two weeks.&nbsp; Are you talking a large sum of money?&nbsp; They will work with LEO if they think your laundering money.&nbsp;

				Did you log into Mtgox with TOR? If so they might&#039;ve locked Your account :X<br /><br />Also just to be sure, you didn&#039;t use Mtgix right?lol<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Nope, I have never logged in on TOR.<br /><br />Nah defo not been using mtgix for the last 9 months lol. I have been transferring from and to the same bank account since I started using it (my bank saved the account) so there has been absolutely no change. They are saying it&#039;s an issue with barclays bank but barclays are yet to get back to them. 24hour banking and online banking makes me think they are talking total shit though.

				Bump!<br /><br />Just to let the community know that I still haven&#039;t been credited with my money and they are now ignoring my support tickets.<br /><br />Beware if you decide to use mtgox.com, I never thought I&#039;d be saying this as I have been a loyal user for a year and have never been treated so poorly by any company.

				Bro that is not right AT ALL!!!! If you have ever logged on with TOR that could messs u up, but u said u did not. If you are in the usa, There is soo much easier ways than to go through the hassel of mtgox.. Try www.bitinstant,com they have other country&#039;s now im pretty sure they have just added, also blockchain will let u setup a free wallet and show u how to deposit bitcoins also, i dont know why ppl choose to even bother with mtgox.. Unless that is just your only way , but you need to contact them email them do whatever, it should take no more than a few hours in my experience , I just started using bitinstant and they are by far the fastest most simple way. Hope that was some help at least for future deposits

				@Christy nugs-- 2weeks slow? There&#039;s no way this guy/girl should have had to waited that long, thats why i refuse to ever use that place. To many fee&#039;s any bullshit. Why use something that takes u over 24hrs, when you can you a site that will take anywhere from 1 to 4 hours at the most? And dont need to sign up for anything that is way way more easy than this otherplace he uses, plus he has it linked to his bank account which by no means , means anything cause bitcoins are fully legal to buy. But i just prefer going useing money gram handing over cash get my receipt then im gone... No name no nothing. Just seems to make more sense, but everyone is entitled to their own way i was just staying there are much better ways..

				I had 400 us dollars tied up for an entire month so I understand the feeling. They eventually got it to show up and I squealed like a little child. I don&#039;t understand why they would say they had lost the information since they only keep 200 transactions a day...that sounds like a bullshit low number for such a high volume business like mtgox...<br />Regardless, I hope your money shows up. Have you requested that uh...Mark(?) look into it? (Or is it Gareth?) Who&#039;s bitinstant and who&#039;s mtgox? Anyway...basically anyone who actually knows what they&#039;re doing and likely gets paid more than every one else can surely look into it for you and handle it promptly.<br />Good luck!!

				Gerryboy your problems are down to Barclays Bank, who suspended MtGox&#039;s UK bank account.&nbsp; MtGox released a statement here https://mtgox.com/press_release_20120925.html.<br /><br />This is the same thing that Metrobank did to Intersango a month or two before.&nbsp; <br /><br />I believe that you will eventually get your money credited to your MtGox account, but it could well take alot more time. <br /><br />Have a search on these forums for &quot;Bitcoin UK&quot; and you&#039;ll see many posts about this, and recommendations for how to get bticoin in the future.

				When you say you transferred cash do you mean you deposited the cash in the bank? If so, did you write down your reference code on the deposit slip? That&#039;s the only way they&#039;ll know if it was from you.
