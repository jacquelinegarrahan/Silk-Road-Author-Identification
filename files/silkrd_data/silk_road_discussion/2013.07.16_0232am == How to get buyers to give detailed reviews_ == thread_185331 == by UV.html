				Offer some nice free bonus on next purchase for people that will write nice feedback and send you link to a forum review they wrote about your product, when they place their next order. i have seen some vendors doing that, sound ideal for both sides, better than offering free samples and 80% of people write nothing after getting them.<br /><br />Now send me some coke for this advice&nbsp; ;D

				Good plan. That&#039;ll encourage business to get off the ground too being a new dealer here.

				Ohhh if you new than hell ya offer some free samples to some people with good stat or known coke reviewers, or discounted opening prices, you can also send a sample to pineapple for lab testing to show quality.<br /><br />Now thats more coke you need to send me (just kidding i don&#039;t do coke at all for months now)

				We&#039;ve done samples and so far it&#039;s got off to a good start. Had some hot reviews. Heard about Pineapple too, sounds like a plan.

				On the coke scene its very simple - if your gear is good is will go viral here, if it lame than only low prices will make it sell,<br />Pm some people that you see they are very active on the coke threads and offer them sample in exchange for reviews in there and on your threads, i got some nice samples from vendors this way and paid them back with great reviews, basically thats the name of the game - more reviews.<br /><br /><br />I can make a vendor marketing manual :)

				That&#039;s a good one too. I only want to send U.K to U.K though so isn&#039;t it rough to ask if people are from the U.K?

				When we are talking about coke samples.. Dont worry, its a high demand product.<br />Just post there that you want reviewers from UK that spent at least X money with Y stats<br />And that reviewed at least 2 coke vendors with detailed reviews, they will come to you.<br /><br />If you have a reliable lab test and will get good lab test results from Pineapple, you are done, although selling only in UK does limit your potential market.

				Good plan. :)<br /><br />I will do international and bigger listings eventually just after I&#039;ve found my feet. Don&#039;t like to rush things.
