				So I placed an order last night, and it said that it was verified and &quot;processing&quot; then I messaged the vendor today to see if I ordered correctly, and he said that he can&#039;t see my order at all. This is my first attempt at an SR transaction, so Im completely new. Does anyone know whats going on here? Under my orders it says I have ordered the product from this vendor, but the vendor cant see it. Also, my bitcoins arent in my account anymore(I assume theyre in escrow). The vendor is considered to be very well trusted from everything that Ive seen.

				How soon after you placed the order did you send the message?&nbsp; Maybe there is a delay of a few hours before it is sent to the vendor?&nbsp;

				Only way vendor wouldn&#039;t see it is if you FE, but it sounds like you didn&#039;t if it&#039;s there in your orders tab. See no reason why they wouldn&#039;t see it. Maybe give them the order # that could help with the search. An annoying thing is that when you ctrl+f on tor it is set by default to be case sensitive so if he&#039;s searching your name that could screw it up.
