				Drugs are a huge problem these days - and I don&#039;t mean a problem like they were in the &#039;70&#039;s and &#039;80&#039;s. I&#039;m not preaching about a war on drugs here. I&#039;m worried about the children. Those little bastards are more technologically savvy than I was when I was a tween (surfing porn on my mothers compaq) and they learn a lot faster too. I attribute that to the rise in ADD and ADHD cases. (That&#039;s my own belief and I haven&#039;t read any medical journals on the matter.)<br /><br />&nbsp;The real problem IS Silk Road. Don&#039;t get me wrong! I love what it&#039;s doing and the philosophy behind it, but age is a fleeting factor for me. There is no way for an honest vendor to tell a clients age just through the order process and message boards. I&#039;m over the fact that there will never be a system good enough to be incorporated so that true vendors can see who the person it is that they&#039;re selling their product to.<br /><br />In all, I believe this rant is more intended for the LE that lurk on the message boards than anyone else. Change comes down to the decisions they make in the meetings they have. I would hate to see this place raided because like I said, it&#039;s an honest way to send and receive drugs, but they are missing the point entirely...Legalization leads to regulation which will only help our cause in keeping bad drugs off the streets and children away until they are at an age when society believes they are adults. /endrant]<br /><br />I&#039;d like to see some discussion on the matter, and what change really means. Is it going out and voting, running for public office (DIY), and/or spreading worthwhile knowledge and shifting closed-minded perceptions? I believe the answer is all three and then some, but having high hopes seems trivial these days.

				I don&#039;t think many kids will be able to get bitcoins.<br />and I think it may be worse with the research chemicals being sold legally in shops in UK for example..<br />also the ones that do get this far hopefully also know a bit more than average about drugs than other kids and act carefully

We may have a few at risk older teens on here but they would be buying drugs on the street if SR didn&#039;t exist so killing one doesn&#039;t necessarily fix the problem. There was an article I read yesterday about a new Oxy pill that could not be broken down for abuse and the LE guy talking about it said that all it would do is push Heroin use up... it is like a balloon, if you push one end down all the air goes rushing to the other side... making drugs hard to get doesn&#039;t stop drug abuse, it just moves it to somewhere else. I will go on record as saying that I am FAR MORE WORRIED about teens texting and driving than I am about a 17 year old buying a gram of weed of SR.

				tj u want to know something some retard got busted for have 89 hydrocodone pills, and after Turner accepted the package at his home, a subsequent search warrant of the home resulted in the seizure of 20 Opana — oxymorphone — tablets, several ounces of marijuana and an undisclosed amount of cash, police added.

				Nicely written post, thegrey.<br />Like you said, there is no way for a vendor to know a person&#039;s age. However, I personally feel that if a teenager or anybody for that matter, is able to find their way into the deep web and to places such as Silk Road, as well as go through the process of getting bitcoins, ect, then they &quot;deserve&quot; to purchase from here. Most kids would quit after finding out it&#039;s not as easy as using mom and dad&#039;s credit card, let alone go through the process of setting up TOR. <br /><br />Unfortunately, most officials are just doing their job. You will never find a customs official allow a 2lb package of heroin to go through just because they believe the laws are irrational. It is their job to follow the rules, regardless of whether or not they agree with them. Granted, local police who try and raid a house over a small amount of any substance is ridiculous. It&#039;s a total waste of resources as well as detrimental to the offender&#039;s record. Ending the drug war seems to be one of the hottest issues in the current US presidential race, so hopefully change is not too far down the road. *fingers crossed*<br /><br />sdesu

				As I agree with tHEgREy first post. Legalization with regulation is the best way to keep kids from getting drugs. dzlrv made a great point about how hard it is to get bitcoins, but most kids would be able to pick up a moneypak from 7-11 and get them here though. And TrustusJones is spot on about high school. The one thing about kids are, they will find a way. I know growing up it was easier for me to get a bag of weed than it was getting a pack of cigarets.

				You guys put my mind at ease for now...<br /><br />If the kids are smart enough to get this far, then they should be well versed on the effects/side-effects of the drugs of their choice.<br /><br />I&#039;m what you consider a late bloomer. My first puff of Jane at 18, and since then I&#039;ve wholly assured myself that what I put in my body was in my best interest. I know more about illicit and prescribed drugs, not because of a pharmacist parent upbringing, but because of the paranoia that comes with ingesting unknown chemicals.<br /><br />When I see a teen, I think of the ones on the social networking sites. They&#039;re already open-minded and overly curious, so to them, why not look into a place like this and try it out; especially now since SR is getting a lot of media attention all over the world!<br /><br />As for decriminalization/legalization I believe it has to be a UN mandate for it to gain a strong following from otherwise conservative and religious people. Corporate attitudes also need an evolution of thinking as they are the ones who control a large portion of lawmaking decisions in this world.

				I also agree with the thought that if anyone is able to figure out the bitcoin exchange, the tor process, pgp encryption and all that jazz, then they are more than likely intelligent enough to make an informed decision on whether or not they wish to ingest drugs.&nbsp; If kids really wanted to to get drugs or alcohol, it is not very hard to do so on the street.&nbsp; My group of friends and I started experimenting with marijuana and alcohol when we were 13, and evolved to &quot;harder&quot; drugs not long afterwards.&nbsp; We all turned into responsible adults with great careers and families because we were intelligent about the use.&nbsp; And although I do believe that it would be beneficial to have proof of age here to purchase anything, it would be impossible to enforce.&nbsp; But like others have said, if someone has been able to get this far, they probably &quot;deserve&quot; to make a purchase.

				Kids have no use for SR.&nbsp; Don&#039;t you remember HS?&nbsp; Drugs around every corner, anything you could ever want was down the street or in someones locker.&nbsp; Sure, we didn&#039;t have access to Heroin (probably could have if I was looking), but plenty of access to QUALITY blow (better than I can get now), great herb, any pill you could imagine, and a few decent acid hook ups.&nbsp; The only thing we ever had an issue finding were good shrooms, and those came around often enough.<br /><br />I think any kid that wants to use drugs doesn&#039;t need to wait for the bitcoin&#039;s to clear and the product to ship, they can just ask the guy sitting next to them in class...

And the constructs of your truthful harmonizing actions will spread and inspire and change the world as it will. <br /><br />I think you miss the root causes entirely. SR is simply a symptom of the ridiculous system we have in place. LE&#039;s are much more a problem to freedom than underage dumb fucks who have been educated well enough to work a mouse, but haven&#039;t been educated well enough to not die from some random buy on some random underground drug site. There are pharmacies online that will ship to anyone without a prescription. I&#039;ve done it. <br /><br />Education and nurturing are what the kids need and they should grow up to be fine outstanding members of the drug community like us :)<br /><br />And for that matter, education and self assessment are what us adults could use imo to further growth and the proper governing of ourselves. I imagine many of you may agree.

				I had pretty decent connection in HS and had great ones in my early 20s... since then not as much. I was over in London when things like Spice were starting to become available, but find it kinda nuts you can buy RCs over the counter now. However, that has been going on for awhile, I am sure many are familiar with Dutch &quot;Smart Shops&quot;.
