				I&#039;ve got kind of a weird problem.&nbsp; On April 8, I placed three orders from three vendors.&nbsp; This was shortly before the bitcoin crash, and absolutely dumb luck for me.<br /><br />From Vendor A, I ordered a 1/4 of Girl Scout Cookies.<br />From Vendor B, I ordered a 1/4 of Strawberry Kush.<br />From Vendor C, I ordered 1/2 oz of &quot;regular commercial&quot; weed.<br /><br />On April 11, I received my 1/4 of Girl Scout Cookies.&nbsp; Vendor A, &#039;NorCalKing&#039; fucking rocks!<br /><br />Also on April 11, my order from Vendor C switched to &#039;in transit&#039;.&nbsp; On April 12, I had a message from Vendor C that they had &quot;accidentally deleted the file with the addresses for the shipments&quot; and asked me to resend my address with the promise that my order would be in the mail on 4/13.&nbsp; I PGP&#039;d my name and address and resent it.<br /><br />Also on April 12, my order from Vendor B switched to &#039;in transit&#039;.<br /><br />Today, April 16, I received a shipment, pictured below.&nbsp; It&#039;s denser than it looks, and I don&#039;t have a scale, but there&#039;s no way this is more than a 1/4 oz.&nbsp; These nuggs are also bone dry.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see any way this is hydro, which leaves me thinking that Vendor C sent me 1/4 oz of &quot;regular commercial&quot; weed rather than the 1/2 oz that I paid for to help cover their bitcoin losses.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; I apparently can&#039;t post images, but below is an image of what came in the mail today posted to a disposable Photobucket account.&nbsp; I put all of the weed I received in a clear sandwich bag and cut a strip off of a seller&#039;s vacuum bag which looks to be addressed to me, &#039;pluto&#039;, but I can&#039;t read it.<br />http://i1335.photobucket.com/albums/w673/pluto4111/mystery_bag_zpsf0967999.jpg<br /><br />What do you think?&nbsp; Assuming my 1/4 of Strawberry Kush arrives from Vendor B, then I have to contact Vendor C.&nbsp; I am trying to makes lots of small purchases and quietly build stats, but I won&#039;t let myself be stolen from.

				That seems like a pretty complicated way to say that you think Vendor C shorted you on weight for 1/2 oz of regular commercial weed. Weigh it and let them know what you received vs. what you ordered.<br /><br />FWIW, it seems like stealing 1/4 oz of mid-grade weed is not too efficient of a way for vendors to make up for the bitcoin crash.

				I looked through the weed.&nbsp; It&#039;s got a few seeds.&nbsp; I smoked a nice size bowl and got a good high, but it&#039;s definitely commercial.&nbsp; The more that I think about it, the more I think it&#039;s probably just an honest mistake.

				One time I got 3nugs that looked like no more than 2g and it weighed exactly 7grams.&nbsp; Just food for thought.&nbsp; It was however dank ass dense fresh nugs and not schwag.<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/bmg.jpg<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/bm9.jpg<br /><br />.2 would give 4-5 medium sized hits out of a bowl. It was insane and fucking potent lol good ol days.
