				In all my time here over the months, I&#039;ve never seen it actually down.&nbsp; &nbsp;It gets timed out and other server errors due to heavy traffic.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you try a proxy site for a quick minute , you see that SR is up just fine.&nbsp; It&#039;s TOR that is the problem.

				+1 for what colorblack said. I went there via clearnet to http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to and got the login screen. I, of course, did not enter my login information, but the site is still up. Tor is acting like a little bitch though. Plus i was able to login through my dummy account to see if things were really up and they area.

				When the site is down it gives me time to come into the forums and read. Holy shit are these forums terrible. There is so much bad information on here. Its also amazing how many people do not understand btc and don&#039;t realize that it makes no difference how much btc is...the price for drugs stays the same. Also for those of you who do not know...when SR is back up, go to account at the top, then click settings on the right hand side, then click display on dollars. That way you see everything in US dollars instead of btc prices. Also if you want to know how much the btc is on SR at the moment, just add something to your cart and it will then give you the current value of the btc on Silk Road.<br /><br />Also for those of you that are worried that while SR is down you could lose money if the btc gos down. Relax, it is only going up. In fact it will be even higher the longer SR is down as SR is on a 24hr weighted average of Mt.Gox.<br /><br />If you read a thread and the OP asks for some help and you do not 100% know the answer.....do not post. <br />

				Okay, so I cannot access SR through Tor nor can I access SR through Tor via onion.to; however, I can access SR via the onion.to through clearnet browsers on multiple devices. SR is not down. SR is not dead. Just give it time. Our drugs are safe.

				+1 for what RxKing said. Most (I think everyone!)&#039;s prices are pegged to the dollar. BTC can be worth $5 dollars or $97, that would be irrelevant to our purposes. That $30 dollar oxy or $85 dollar gram of coke will stay that same price in *dollars*. Your drugs will not get super cheap or super expensive because of BTC fluctuations.. hence why I just have everything displayed in dollars, and you all should too!<br />I would find it hilarious if any vendor had their product prices pegged to the BTC and NOT the dollar.

That vendor has decided to pay 6% to lock in the price it is at the time you purchase it. And it is actually one of the WORST ....no it is THE WORST thing a vendor can do! In the past 12 months..there has been a 1 week period where the btc went from 13-14 to 10..but it was right back up... and that was the only time it might have made sense.... But even that 1 week it was not the right thing to do...<br /><br />The biggest problem is lets say the vendor is selling a gram of coke for $ 100. And the btc is worth $10. That means the gram cost 10 coins.. so you as a buyer make the purchase and the vendor gets 10 coins put in escrow...notice I said 10 coins...and not 100 dollars.. and after he marks it in transit...the 17 day auto finalize clock begins.. So he is hoping that you the buyer...finalizes that order (10 coins) while they are still worth $10 a piece...now if he hedged it...then it makes no difference when you finalize..as $100 goes into his account in escrow ..and no matter when the buyer finalizes...he will get $100. Now one of the bad things is...not only did he pay 6% for this option...if when the buyer finalizes...the btc went up to $13...it does not matter..he gets $100 or $10 per coin. So he does not see the upside (in this case the extra $30 or 30%)..and as we all know..in the last 12 months..all the btc has done is gone up...and again by the time you finalize who knows how long it is before that vendor converts it to cash... so the vendor paid 6% to lock in $100....not a good deal..<br /><br />Now if the btc was to go down to $8 a coin his 10 coins would have been worth $80... so you take out the $6 he spent...and in this example it would have been good...but the problem with this example is this has not happened in over a year..and 90% of vendors do not understand that you don&#039;t get the upside...SR keeps that!! <br /><br />So if the hedge worked where you paid 6% to lock in a minimum of $10 a coin and you also got to keep whatever the plus side is then it would be a different story...still not a good deal...as it is hard to over come the 6%...but at least as a vendor you would lock in a min price&nbsp; you are going to get...with no max... but this is fantasy..so who cares..lets go back to how it is... <br /><br />A vendor that has an item hedged gets that amount he sold the item for...now back in the day...especially for non domestic vendors that could wait for 17+ days to get there money...they were willing to pay 6% because in that time the coin could go from $8 to $1.25!!!! But in this time and age it is a terrible option for vendors...and I believe it is &quot;left over&quot; and is a HUGE money maker for SR. Now it is the vendors responsibility to learn everything and do their homework...but I can also say it is not exactly explained in great detail anywhere and in fact has a &quot;recommended&quot; next to it when you get a vendor account for the settings...and A LOT of vendors have that box checked in their settings because it has a &quot;recommended&quot; next to it&nbsp; and they&nbsp; do not know what it even is or how it works...<br /><br />So that is the hedge system.....You can see that it has no bearing at all on buyers...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Anyhow I honestly don&#039;t know what affects the price. I just don&#039;t want to be 0.01 short on my dope. I want to order it now while it is what it is and hedge that shit so I don&#039;t have worry about it ever again and I can just wait for the mailman. That&#039;s why I&#039;m grumpy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />Well you shouldn&#039;t be grumpy! When Sr comes back up you will have more money then you had when it was down...that is a fact! So it willbe Impossible for you to be .01 short...as SR uses a 24 hour weighted system to mt.gox..so even if right now the btc went down(it didnt.. in fact it went to $60+) it would take 6+ hours for it to be seen on SR... so you are all good.<br /><br />When Sr went down, btc was valued at $52 on SR and it was obv going up...so again..you are all good..so don&#039;t be grumpy and answer my question! (in fact you should be really happy as you can get even more dope! then if SR was up...because if it was up...you would have already bought your drugs:) )<br /><br />But I quoted you because I wanted to know what you meant by you want&nbsp; to &quot;hedge&quot; that shit...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When I&#039;m holding bitcoins their value fluctuates,;it can go up or down. When I place an order the value gets locked to the time of the order assuming the vendor uses hedging. I want to place my order so I get the drugs I paid for, and so my purchasing power stops fluctuating.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well thank you for answering my question...and I figured that is what you meant...but you are wrong about something.....<br /><br />When the vendor hedges an item...that has NOTHING to do with the buyer..NOTHING.. That vendor has decided to pay 6% to lock in the price it is at the time you purchase it. And it is actually one of the WORST ....no it is THE WORST thing a vendor can do! In the past 12 months..there has been a 1 week period where the btc went from 13-14 to 10..but it was right back up... and that was the only time it might have made sense.... But even that 1 week it was not the right thing to do...<br /><br />The biggest problem is lets say the vendor is selling a gram of coke for $ 100. And the btc is worth $10. That means the gram cost 10 coins.. so you as a buyer make the purchase and the vendor gets 10 coins put in escrow...notice I said 10 coins...and not 100 dollars.. and after he marks it in transit...the 17 day auto finalize clock begins.. So he is hoping that you the buyer...finalizes that order (10 coins) while they are still worth $10 a piece...now if he hedged it...then it makes no difference when you finalize..as $100 goes into his account in escrow ..and no matter when the buyer finalizes...he will get $100. Now one of the bad things is...not only did he pay 6% for this option...if when the buyer finalizes...the btc went up to $13...it does not matter..he gets $100 or $10 per coin. So he does not see the upside (in this case the extra $30 or 30%)..and as we all know..in the last 12 months..all the btc has done is gone up...and again by the time you finalize who knows how long it is before that vendor converts it to cash... so the vendor paid 6% to lock in $100....not a good deal..<br /><br />Now if the btc was to go down to $8 a coin his 10 coins would have been worth $80... so you take out the $6 he spent...and in this example it would have been good...but the problem with this example is this has not happened in over a year..and 90% of vendors do not understand that you don&#039;t get the upside...SR keeps that!! <br /><br />So if the hedge worked where you paid 6% to lock in a minimum of $10 a coin and you also got to keep whatever the plus side is then it would be a different story...still not a good deal...as it is hard to over come the 6%...but at least as a vendor you would lock in a min price&nbsp; you are going to get...with no max... but this is fantasy..so who cares..lets go back to how it is... <br /><br />A vendor that has an item hedged gets that amount he sold the item for...now back in the day...especially for non domestic vendors that could wait for 17+ days to get there money...they were willing to pay 6% because in that time the coin could go from $8 to $1.25!!!! But in this time and age it is a terrible option for vendors...and I believe it is &quot;left over&quot; and is a HUGE money maker for SR. Now it is the vendors responsibility to learn everything and do their homework...but I can also say it is not exactly explained in great detail anywhere and in fact has a &quot;recommended&quot; next to it when you get a vendor account for the settings...and A LOT of vendors have that box checked in their settings because it has a &quot;recommended&quot; next to it&nbsp; and they&nbsp; do not know what it even is or how it works...<br /><br />So that is the hedge system.....You can see that it has no bearing at all on buyers...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />If my order was cancelled or refunded I would get the hedged value, not the btc value though, no?<br /><br />And that is true that the bitcoin has only gone up recently, but I find it swings +-5 on some days now, and I just don&#039;t want the downside of that swing. I have ordered by now and I almost almost had enough to get an extra point of heroin, so as you said not being able to log in was in my favour. But it could have not been...<br /><br />I just always want to spend my coins the second I buy them as a rule.

				Yes if you order was cancelled or refunded then you would get the hedged value if the item was hedged.. but that should not happen very often if at all(cancelled and/or refunded)<br />And you saying that by rule you use the coins right away...it PERFECT and exactly what you should always do!! <br />I was just trying to tell people that today when SR was out...the coin was actually going up so no one had to worry about losing value.. Hope you got in and have your good on the way..<br /><br />Take care :)<br />

There was a lot of chatter on bitcointalk.org beforehand of people fleeing.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to mess around with bitcoins, you really should be reading the forum and keeping up on the latest news, rumors, etc.<br /><br />Several factors are helping bitcoin right now. In the last few months, legal businesses like Wordpress.com and Reddit have started accepting it. The FinCen report a few days ago made bitcoin officially legal in the US. It wasn&#039;t illegal before, but the US gov had not taken an official position on it. Now it&#039;s explicitly legal. That paves the way for much wider adoption among mainstream businesses. And there haven&#039;t been any major hacks or thefts in a long while. That&nbsp; helps to build confidence.<br /><br />Unless some catastrophic event happens, I expect BTC price to keep rising for some time. So not holding onto your coins from $5 is a sunk cost, but you can always buy now and still make money.<br />
