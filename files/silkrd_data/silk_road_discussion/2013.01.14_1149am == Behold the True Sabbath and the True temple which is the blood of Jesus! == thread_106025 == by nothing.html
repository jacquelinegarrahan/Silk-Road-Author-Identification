				If you need evidence that god is completely compassionless, just look at the story of job. God from the bible is just a mega-asshole. Seriously if not paying homage to some random deity in the sky means that your life is gonna be shit, then that guy really shouldn&#039;t have power over anything.

				To me, the bible has two meanings. On its face, the bible is a storybook outlining the commonalities of the human experience as shared at the time of its writing. However, for some odd reason we may never know, there is so much deeper meaning and inspiration in that book that to deny that it&#039;s special is to lie to yourself. I&#039;m not saying an omnipotent, hirsute old white guy in a robe is behind it, but that&#039;s besides the point.<br /><br />God did not literally speak to humans from the heavens and instruct them to write a book. He is not some conscious being that sits in the sky and casts masturbating teenagers into eternal hellfire. However, most people in those days (and even now) seemed to be comfortable believing that&#039;s what goes on, and so we created a God in our image to describe the stuff we all seemed to have in common for some inexplicable reason. <br /><br />Truth is, God is in you. There is no actual separation between you, &quot;God&quot;, and everything else that exists. Since it&#039;s kind of difficult and confusing to pray to everything/nothing/you, people created a sort of human avatar (Jesus) for their divine self. Perhaps he was actually alive at some point and was such an awesome person that people saw &quot;God&quot; in him, and he gained a following. Some call this chance, others call it a miracle. Sometimes both are one and the same. In fact, that&#039;s the essence of what it means to be alive and conscious: we can make up our own scales of objectivity and decide what the miracles are. We may never see a superpowered man in the sky casting down lightning, but there are plenty of questions we&#039;ll never be able to answer as long as we&#039;re alive. I think that at some point, things just get so weird that there&#039;s just no way to empirically measure or define what you&#039;re experiencing.
