				Hello, I&#039;m really new to the whole SR thing, although I really like the concept, fuck the government, they have no right to dictate what we put into our bodies. <br /><br /><br />I just have one question, you see...I don&#039;t have clean friends, and the last thing I want to do is ship drugs to the home of a drug dealer(lols).<br /><br />And since I&#039;m really sketched about using my home address for the delivery, how safe is a PO Box? It just seems so weird to have drugs shipped to a post office and have them sit there until you pick them up. Can anyone that uses a PO box offer some input about the security of them? I&#039;d really appreciate it. Also, I assume the packages that contain weed are packaged so there&#039;s no detectable smell through the package(assuming I go through a credible vendor) with vaccuum sealing, if I understand correctly?

				You can use a Private PO box, the little the better, have to be a good one, like a mom and pop. You don&#039;t even need ID for this PO boxes, so you even can get a box with a fake name, at least in my country. This stores are very worried about just delivering correctly than whats inside, and if its a stealth order from a nice SR vendor, then you are gonna be fine.

				No reason to worry IMO about having it sent to your home vs a PO Box.&nbsp; If you are getting busted you are getting busted.&nbsp; The PO Box is actually more suspicious to LE than just sending it to your home.&nbsp; They have your address and know who you are with the PO Box, so it is really a false feeling of security.<br /><br />Now if you are afraid to have it sent to your home because you are in High School or college and live at home with mom and dad then I would say you should probably refrain from buying drugs on SR altogether.

				I&#039;m also new to this and that was a similar concern of mine, however I have also heard, and I&#039;m actually posting this here in hopes that someone will actually be able to give me a straight answer on it.<br /><br />Basically what I&#039;ve heard is that if you have something delivered to your home address and&nbsp; you use a fake name you can&#039;t actually be busted for it.&nbsp; The idea being that you &quot;can&#039;t control what people send to you.&quot;&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how true this is, so I&#039;m simply posting it here in hopes that I could get some clarification on this as well as possibly helping ease the OP&#039;s mind if this is in fact true.&nbsp; To me, if this is true, it also seems like you could have greater mileage with this in apartments where tenants are rotated in/out relatively frequently and you could even potentially use the name of a previous tenant if you&#039;ve gotten their mail in the past.<br /><br />Again, this is only what I&#039;ve heard so I was hoping to get some clarification.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

Better off using a real name to a real address. :)
