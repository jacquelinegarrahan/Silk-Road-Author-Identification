				So I used Bitfloor and everything worked out ok.<br />I had an original problem yesterday which was related to the lady at the bank counter not having listened to me.<br />When, done correctly Bitfloor works.<br />You will however, not be happy at first with how many coins you receive if you do an Instant type Bitcoin Purchase....<br />If the market at Mt.Gox is 40dollars per coin.. you&#039;re going to pay 44... if you do instant.<br />you could wait for somebody to fill your order for 40 dollars per coin... but it wont happen and you&#039;ll wait all day cause why would anybody do that if they can get 44?<br />However, keep in mind that Bitcoin values will flux based on which market you pull data from. Over at Btc-e.com those very same coins are only worth 38 dollars each. <br /><br />So why not fund your bitfloor account with the Bank of America cash deposit......... send your USD funds to a Btc-e.com account (you can send USD as well as BTC).... and then purchase your own bitcoins at a lower market value? I happen to have bought from BTC-e.com many many times.<br />This will be how i purchase next time.<br /><br />PEOPLE PLEASE STOP ASKING QUESTIONG ABOUT &quot;DO THEY REQUIRE GOVT ID&quot;<br />That question is 100% irrelivant unless you do not have a valid ID.<br />Using a Fake only increases your risk of losing money.<br />A bank does not have to give back your money if you gave it to them under a false ID if they can prove you did so.... just so you know that.<br /><br />Here are some Relevant facts about Bitcoin<br />It is Not illegal to buy/sell/own bitcoin!<br />It is a very common practice current day, to buy/sell bitcoin at an Exchange website for Monetary gain.<br />This is what you tell somebody &quot;I trade them like stocks and make money, how much do you earn by doing nothing?&quot;<br />You may buy your coins with your Govt ID... no problems here.<br />You may now make 3 free blockchain.com Wallets (you can use TOR)<br />Transfer your GovtID purchased Coins to Wallet1<br />Transfer Coins to Wallet2<br />Transfer Coins to Wallet3<br />Your coins are 300% washed now.<br />It is like putting 5 pennies into a jar of 1000 pennies... shake the jar... and pull 5 pennies back from the jar... i gaurantee that you did not remove the same exact penny.<br /><br />This is how to do bitcoin.

				How do you send USD to btc-e?&nbsp; The only USD withdrawal method I&#039;ve seen is direct deposit into bank account.

				Bitfloor also went very smoothly for me.&nbsp; Setup my account, setup a deposit at a BOA, walked in grabbed an out of state deposit slip.&nbsp; Teller filled it out for me.&nbsp; Took my cash and deposited it into the account I was given.&nbsp; Also picked up a few extra out of state deposit forms for future deposits.&nbsp; Even though Bitcoins are not illegal to purchase I would like to point out NO ID IS ASKED FOR WHEN MAKING A DEPOSIT!&nbsp; You just give them the deposit slip and the deposit is made, you could also do this from the drive thru with no issues at all if you wanted to.&nbsp; I live 20 minutes away from a BOA and by the time I got home my cash was in my Bitfloor account.&nbsp; The only objection I have to them is their Bitcoin purchasing price, which was almost four dollars more than Mt. Gox per coin.&nbsp; I was only charged $2.86 to transfer $200.00 USD into the Bitfloor account, but they get you in the back end charging inflated Bitcoin prices.&nbsp; So it ended up being around $11.00 USD in fees to transfer $200.00 USD into 4.51 Bitcoins.&nbsp; Bitinstant is fairly cheaper, espically using Mt. Gox.&nbsp; Which comes to around $6.00 USD to transfer $200.00 USD into Bitcoins from start to finish.<br /><br />Hope this helps!.

				I used Bitfloor last week and everything went smooth. I also picked up some extra deposit slips for next time. I&#039;ll definitely use Bitfloor again.
