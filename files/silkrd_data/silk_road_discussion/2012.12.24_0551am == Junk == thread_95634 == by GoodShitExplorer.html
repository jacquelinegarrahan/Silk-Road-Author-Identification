				I would really like to move away from the &quot;feel good drugs&quot; and move on to more introspective, learning drugs. My trip on 5 grams of shrooms last night was just absolutely exquisite.<br /><br />In direct contradiction to that, I&#039;m itching to try opiates :P

				3. Try a heroic dose of Mushroom<br />[/quote]<br /><br />What do you consider heroic more than 7 grams? That seems heroic to me. I must warn you 7+ grams of Rockers shrooms and you will be seeing Unicorns and rainbows in your living room.

				Great topic GSE, thanks for starting the discussion.&nbsp; My resolution for 2013 is to gain a better appreciation of Ecstasy/MDMA.&nbsp; I love my &quot;old fashioned&quot; drugs, speed, coke, H etc, but farewelled the world of recreational substance use just before the E boom.&nbsp; In 2013 I am going to find out what I missed!&nbsp; Peace and Love to all ;))

				My resolution is to get back to business, since I&#039;ve been out of practice locally due to a debilitating accident I had. <br /><br />As far as business goes, I primarily dealt in Methylone, so I am looking to make 2013 the year I manage to hold a key of it in my hand...<br /><br />I also would love to break into dealing shroom analogs like 4-ho-mipt and 4-aco-dmt and all that more regularly locally. <br /><br />After that, as far as things I would love to try...<br />Acid is still on the list, as well as legitimate mushies. <br /><br />Would love to try Ket as well.

				It&#039;s a bit too late now for orders so these are the ones I definitely will try to get my hands on for 2013: <br /><br />1) LSD - Really keen to see what it&#039;s like after having done shrooms a couple times, mixed emotions really with conflicting reports I&#039;ve heard both people enjoying it a lot and some not so much<br />2) Adderall - I&#039;m interested to see how it would affect me when I&#039;m trying to learn something new<br />3) Ketamine and 2CB - Planning to try this and then maybe mix it with some mdma as I&#039;ve heard this combination is glorious<br /><br />that&#039;s all, and on top of that just the usual stuff I&#039;ve been doing for a while.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait for a great year ahead!&nbsp; 8)
