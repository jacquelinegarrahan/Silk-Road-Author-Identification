				You&#039;re expecting a new SR this fast?&nbsp; First of all, people need to get their shit together before anything happens.&nbsp; DPR put himself out there and didn&#039;t listen to advice from experts.&nbsp; Plus, he lived in America.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to know what security measures an owner of a marketplace takes since we&#039;re all &quot;anonymous,&quot; but this shit has to be figured out first and foremost to prevent another situation like this.
