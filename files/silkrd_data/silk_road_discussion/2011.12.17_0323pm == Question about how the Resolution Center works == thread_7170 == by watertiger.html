				I ordered a few weeks ago from a seller that turned out to be a scammer and who has since disappeared from SR. I was lucky enough to refuse his request for direct payment and instead stayed within the SR escrow system.&nbsp; <br /><br />When the package never arrived and I read a bunch of other people complaining that the same seller had scammed them, I contacted SR support and they immediately transferred the transaction to the Resolution Center, which asked both buyer and seller (now gone) to submit proposed resolutions. I proposed a 100% refund of my money and the seller never responded to me or the Resolution Center and never proposed any alternative. <br /><br />I assumed that once the &quot;time for resolution&quot; has passed, I would just see the money make its way automatically into my account. When the resolution period ended and nothing happened, I sent another message to SR Support asking what I needed to do. They got right back to me, but explained that &quot;I do not have the ability to do anything regarding Resolutions.&quot; I don&#039;t want to hound SR Support and I don&#039;t see any way to contact SR Resolution Center directly to ask that they wrap things up and return my funds or to see if they need anything further from me. <br /><br />Anyone have any experience with this process or any suggestions for how I can get the Resolution Center to wrap things up?

				The Admin in charge of that is currently out. Once they logs in those due resolution will be taken care of. I believe another is being trained to take care of this as well so in the future things like this don&#039;t happen. Please, be patient. They will be taken care of as soon as possible.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Problem solved. Got a message from SR earlier today and just now logged on to see that all of the funds have been returned to my account.<br /><br />Thanks to all who monitor and run the escrow system; it saved me big time in this case.
