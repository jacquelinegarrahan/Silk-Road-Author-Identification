				UKpharm got his profile removed for some reason. I think is was over unsent parcels and no refunding or something like that. They were the first people I ordered off and I got my weed within 2 days. They had a very large listing of weed and hash etc. That probably why. I want to order some off &quot;Budworx UK&quot; or &quot;AUSTINAWAYWAY&quot; but I think i&#039;ll wait until they are more established

Haven&#039;t tried it yet but looks/smells pretty good, well over weight too. My first purchase, so I&#039;m no expert, but seems kosher.

				I can recommend DreamGreen, I revived a sample of him last week and it was very good stuff! It was Lemon G13. At the moment he has Lemon Skunk but i&#039;m sure its just a nice :) <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f776457b52

				It hasn&#039;t completely disappeared, but yes I&#039;d agree that our current options are limited. Nuking the current UK vendors thread and starting anew might not be a bad idea, considering the UKPharm thing and the changing scene of the UK market.<br /><br />I would currently recommend:<br /><br />Trava - decent product, good value for the money. Good packaging.<br />MrShah - very helpful, probably the best packaging I&#039;ve seen so far. Very good value for money. Really wish he&#039;d sort out his PGP though.<br /><br />There are others with stronger (and more expensive) wears, but I&#039;m not really into extremely strong skunk. I like to be able to pick up a pen and paper while having a smoke!<br /><br />Hang tight, more vendors will open store sooner rather than later to fill in for Vendor&#039;s who have disappeared.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m based in the UK and have just got myself a sellers account.<br />I doubt the quality of my weed will be as good as some of the other stuff I&#039;ve seen listed on SR, but it&#039;ll by far be the cheapest. <br />Anyway, there are plenty of vendors around, it&#039;s just changed a little recently.<br /><br />MrShah&#039;s Lemon Haze does look particularly good IMO.
