				No offense to the creators and moderators of this awesome website, but I think that is kind of a lot of money to start a seller&#039;s account, and it really discourages people like me from wanting to create a seller&#039;s account.<br /><br />I have some Adderall tabs that I want to sell. I don&#039;t have many to spare, only about ~50mg or so, but I want to list them for the main purpose of having a transaction and gaining experience in this marketplace. If my first transaction is successful, then I have other goods (adderall and marijuana) that I can sell. The cost to create a seller account is far too high for me or anybody else to be able to do this on a whim. <br /><br />What is the rationale behind the high seller&#039;s account cost? Is it to keep non-legitimate accounts off of the site? Is it to avoid anti-drug organizations from saturating the market with fraudulent accounts? Is it for the founders of this website to make some money on the side? I am under the impression that this website is more about the cause and less about making a profit.<br /><br />Is there any way in order to create a seller&#039;s account without having to pay the high up-front costs? Thanks in advance for answering my questions.

				Also, buyers don&#039;t want to deal with fly by night operations. We like to establish a relationship with a vendor who can have enough product for repeat business. If you only have a handful of product to sell, you can&#039;t build up a reputation anyway.

Be professional, smart and source the best products or learn to make them yourself !!!! This is that way you will be able to stay here for 1 year like the big trusted vendors.

This cost 15$ per month (for a basic one) the one i own is 50$ per month, eBay have a LOT of customers and if you find a good niche you will make money, but again on SR there is a LOT of customers, maybe not as much as eBay but this is a totally different kind of customers. Here if you source &quot;that special drug&quot; your customer will be back for more, this rarely happens when you sell electronics, in fact i pay like 700 $ per year to own my own store on eBay so paying 140$ on here only one time is really just a formality. And seriously don&#039;t be tempted to buy a used seller account.. I see you declined the offer of that other guy, smart choice. Oh yeah welcome to SR.

				The vendor account fee was implemented as a way to cut down on scammers, and more specifically in response to a specific user who threatened to send out poison, under the guise of a legitimate substance.&nbsp; <br /><br />At least I think that is how it went down, someone with more history on here can probably fill in the blanks.&nbsp; ???

				I would happily have paid $1000 for my account. Seriously $150 is nothing. The cost makes it so only serious people are getting into vending. The listings would be cluttered beyond belief if vending was a free for all.

				The seller`s account fee was placed to discourage scammers/people who aren`t serious from making accounts. Even with the fee (which I find really reasonable) scammers make accounts and we might see people being cheated from time to time. I guess SR isn`t for people who want to sell small amounts/or are not in the business of dealing regularly. I wouldn`t mind if the price went up, I`m thankful that the fee protects me from potential scammers.

				When I started as a vendor, the $150 fee for SR wasn&#039;t a problem. If you can swing it, you&#039;ll make it back in the first couple of days, if not a week. After a couple of sales and you get some feedback, watch it snowball! <br /><br />The problems begin when it&#039;s time to cash out.

				Agreed with ChillyP. $150 is actually ridiculously cheap to start up a seller account. I would even consider $500 on the low side.<br /><br />If $150 scares you... you&#039;re in the wrong game.

And yes $150 is a lot of money to become a seller, seeing as how I am used to other online selling sites where the cost is generally $0, and also that sellers are needed in order for SR to survive, but it makes sense to charge that amount if the $150 is for a reason other than the Silk Road business model, and instead is used as an additional security measure.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Honest question: why not sell your stuff on the online selling sites where the cost is zero?&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to pay $150 for a SR vendor account, there&#039;s always Topix.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;ve got regular access to decent product and you treat people honestly, you&#039;ll make that $150 back and more in no time flat.&nbsp;

				Personally, I think that the seller&#039;s account fee should be even higher. $150 is a fucking steal for access to the kind of customer base that there is on SR. As a side note, many newcomers don&#039;t realize just how massive this customer base actually is. Only a fraction (I would venture to say less than 20%) of users are active on the forums. The fee should probably be more in the ballpark of $500-$750.<br /><br />This has already been addressed by more than one reply here, but I&#039;ll say it again. Being a vendor on SR is just like setting up and running any other kind of business. If $150 seems to you like a large sum of money to invest, then I can guarantee that your business will fail.

				I wholeheartedly agree with the 2 previous posts. You can`t peddle sticks and stones on SR, unless they`re made of gear or such...

				The possibility of being sorted for the rest of your life means that fee is extremely fair! If you&#039;re not able to pay $150 then buyers aren&#039;t going to have much confidence in you. I recommend vending under a completely different name if you are going to!

This increases the chance that vendors will be people offering their own product directly to buyers.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve said this before and I&#039;ll say it again.. If you can&#039;t afford £100 for the privilege of selling here, get out the drugs game.<br /><br />Simple as that

These threads piss me the fuck off because it just shows that you no clue when it comes to investing to make a return or that you are too selfish to realize that you don&#039;t get things for free in life.

				I think we need to lock this thread. I mean if someone can`t run a business on here with a one time fee of 150$, they can forget about any real life applications of market/strategy.
