				Just checked my email, and had an alert from Dwolla &quot;A money transfer to Mutum Sigillum LLC from your account ID# XXXXXXXXX was returned as a chargeback and the payment will need to be made again.&quot; <br />Checked my Mt. Gox, nothing new or missing.&nbsp; <br />Checked the account linked to Dwolla, nothing new or missing.&nbsp; <br />But my Dwolla account now has a spare $150 that I can&#039;t account for from ANYWHERE?&nbsp; Has anyone else had this happen?&nbsp; Should I be concerned?<br /><br />

				(just my opinion, others may differ)<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming that Dwolla has your real info and it could come back on you. <br /><br />Try to think if there is anything you&#039;ve done that cost $150, that got refunded, could be a few weeks/month apart from each other.<br /><br />If not then I&#039;d report it, if someone else lost money they&#039;ll likely report it once they realize. IMO your better off letting dwolla know if your 100% positive it was a mistake. Better you go to them then them investigate you.<br />

				Yesterday I sent a chunk of money from Dwolla to Mt.Gox and it never arrived.&nbsp; I filed an action with the Mt.Gox&nbsp; Help Desk.&nbsp; They&#039;re currently working on it.&nbsp; Hopefully it will get sorted out.&nbsp; Thankfully it wasn&#039;t a big chunk of cash.

				Yeah, that&#039;s probably my best bet.<br /><br />It&#039;s just so odd.&nbsp; If I look at my end of the finances (account balances, money in and out) everything is matched up, and the money shouldn&#039;t exist.&nbsp; But if I look at THEIR end, (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) it all adds up that the money SHOULD exist.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll shoot them an email to see what&#039;s up.&nbsp; None of the stuff would track back to here anyway. xP

				That sounds exactly like the $150 I lost in Dwolla :-\&nbsp; That would be great if you could get it back too me.&nbsp; PM me and I&#039;ll give you a bitcoin address to send the money too....keep 10% for your effort ;D
