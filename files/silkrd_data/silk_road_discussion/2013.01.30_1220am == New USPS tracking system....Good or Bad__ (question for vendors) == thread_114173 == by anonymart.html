				So correct me if I am wrong...<br /><br />It looks like the new USPS tracking system is getting rid of DCNs which allowed customers to get a pack of them without requesting them from anyone and pay for the price with stamps, very anonymous. Now it seems that you will have to go with your package so they weight it and then put a tracking sticker on it once weighted. This is only available for priority boxes or express, first class will not have a tracking system so privacy will be completely gone, they will have to see your face and package before putting tracking information on package.<br /><br />I dont like it, do you? will you stop using tracking bc of it??<br /><br />As a vendor with this new system will you switch to first class? How does this change affect you? Any ideas or suggestions?<br /><br />Thanks.

This is the only reason I use DCN.

				I dunno if its cause of the new system, but they fully gave me wrong details on tracking from sunday til tuesday..<br /><br />they said that a International package a friend sent me had been tried to be deliverd and a notice was left..<br />Funny thing is i saw my mail lady and she had nothing for me. but it said my package was at my P O.<br /><br />So i called the&nbsp; P O tuesday morning to tell them no slip was left and my tracking claimed a package was attempted to be delivered but no one was home to sign.<br /><br />They asked my address and said no we had no package for u yesterday,but the truck is here maybe its on it..<br /><br />So i told them my tracking said it is at their&nbsp; P O..So i called back 1hour later and she said No maybe its coming fed ex or ups? i had to say again..&#039;NO ITS A INTERNATIONAL EXPRESS PACKAGE&#039; she puts me on hold comes back and says here it is, just came in this AM.. be home to sign..<br /><br />so i was kinda freaking out, but everything went fine.. The supervisor said probly someone scanned it as tried to deliver cause they r suppose to have it to u with in so many days after it clears customs and they messed up..<br /><br />still had me nervous as shit...thank god it was all good..It as not a SR pack and i would never have even called if it was,but from a friend in another country, and she always sends a bunch of little gifts and Original OC&#039;S&nbsp; also, and there is no way their finding them.. id let the cops open the package and go through it, its truly that good..<br /><br />But i wonder if it was cause of the new track system or what?

				As I understand it, there are tracking stickers (now white, self stick) that are free for priority mail at least. I think I have seen them in stacks (pads) and continuous rolls. I think there is a shortage of them at this time. I am guessing that they will be easy to get later. I heard you could even order them online for free (but they are backordered).<br /><br />I have heard some postal workers will hand some out. I have not found any free ones yet and have been told they can&#039;t be given out - you have to bring the package to the counter or buy postage online with the sticker included when u print the postage for the package. I don&#039;t think this is true. I have not wanted to make a fuss at the counter though. I&#039;ll keep trying and expect to find &#039;em free soon :-) NWN

				Lot of bad information here. The 400 tracking labels can be gotten over the counter but only if you find a helpful employee, otherwise you have to order them online. That&#039;s bad unless you have an absolute foolproof drop location that can&#039;t be linked to you; otherwise, your anonymity is fucked. <br /><br />These 400 labels can be affixed to any first class, standard post, or priority mail package; it&#039;s just that it will cost different amounts for each class of package. But make no mistake, you can pay with stamps and drop off at mailboxes, just as with DCNs. You just have to weigh them correctly.<br /><br />goblin

				I went to post office and tried to buy some of the new USPS tracking for first class which is 90 cents and the lady said I needed to bring packages and then the tracking sticker will get printed and she will then put in package. If this is misinformation then every post office I go to is misinform. Yes perhaps they will change this policy once they realize they are losing a bunch of money but not necessarily as USPS has been broke for quite some time bc they offer all these benefits to employees they can&#039;t afford and the government just keeps bailing them out with our money.

				ive not seen any sort of green or white dcn stickers at any postoffice lately, but thats just my take, and for every anecdotal story is an expert so says the complete opposite so someone needs to get to the bottom of this. <br /><br />read this, a super-expert on the usps claims they can only be gotten online or at the counter.
