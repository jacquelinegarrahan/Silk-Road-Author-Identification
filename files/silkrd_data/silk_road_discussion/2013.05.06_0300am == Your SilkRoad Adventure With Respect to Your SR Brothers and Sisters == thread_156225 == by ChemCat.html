				Damn good advice.&nbsp; Get your stuff and move on for the next guy to get his drugs. <br /><br />Some people post here that they cruise all the listings over and over. Window shoppers.&nbsp; <br />Someday they&#039;ll have a minimum balance requirement to continue to the main site.

				I used to a spend a lot of time combing through the site reading almost every domestic listing I could find, but as the site has experienced more and more problems I have made an effort to spend less time on it unless I&#039;m ready to buy. I have no problem leaving access to those who need it more than I do.

				Wow glad i found this thread! it&#039;s full of some old names i remember from when i just started, Got some great advice from a few of you if not all of you on many different subjects. <br />Yeah agreed chem, get on get your drugs and leave so that the next guy can get his orders placed too. It&#039;s safer and more convenient for everyone else.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />the forums are where to chill anyway after you&#039;ve placed your orders. Can you believe the guy trying to make Sr invite only? Im just after writing a paragraph on how stupid it was and that everybody should be able to get help with stuff when they need it, and here i am in a thread where basically eerybody in t has helped me along my journey on the road at some point or another. The road is a great community thanks to all the work the admins and mods! greatly appreciated as im just after saying in another thread as well. <br /><br />+1 chem great post.&nbsp; :P All the best everybody

				The SR brings something more to a world that needs it. We will still come across the occasional asshole, but that&#039;s life and people will be people. That will never change. <br /><br />I am rather new, only been around for a few months (had the name wl2ong, but forgot my pin) but in that time I have communicated with multiple vendors and done business with multiple vendors. I did my research prior to reaching out to said vendors, but it was worth it. I have been pleasantly surprised by the communication, the customer service... We all hate having to call our phone company because they screwed up. Talking to recordings and having to push this button or that number... One of many pluses of SR... It&#039;s personal interaction will always make it more pleasant to do business.

				That&#039;s plenty of time. You must be one of very few who are prepared to take time getting set up. <br /><br />You&#039;re starting a bit at once. Nope it doesn;t sound silly at all. Although it would be a bit to handle at first.<br /><br />Yep, take your time with it, if you can you can, if it&#039;s too much you&#039;rll find out. :)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

Well your better taking it slow than rushing into things, As soon as a new vendor opens up shop, They get swamped by people buying from them if they are legit. So i have no doubt it would be the same for you. Im sure you&#039;ll get the hang of it no problem. <br />Great, hardly any vendors doing oz&#039;s at good prices. Good to see somebody stepping up to the plate even if it is only so many per month.
