				Because I gave this seller (vortexmilkman(98)) a low rating (which was explained in the subject line) I have received these series of threatening messages:<br />1) &quot;So you&#039;re not going to change it or reply? OK, we&#039;ll see what other goodies you receive in your mail&quot;<br />2) &quot;Was nice knowing you.&quot;<br />3) &quot;You&#039;re in a small little town in the middle of nowhere, Im sure the Post office and or local Police will have fun knowing your address at xxx Robinson St is a center of Drug activity.<br />Keep fucking playing with me.&quot;<br /><br />This is unacceptable; what&#039;s the point of a rating system if I can&#039;t be honest, and then this coward threatens me with the police?<br />I will not deal with a jack-ass like this again, and his text responses show that my rating was spot-on!

				Like yakyak said, if you&#039;re new and dealing with a trusted seller, you be best off if you started doing what they ask of you.<br /><br />Vortex handled that very poorly though, and if he&#039;s threatening someone&#039;s well being over a review, he must obviously be in an unstable state of mind. Do that to the wrong person though, and you could end up getting a little more than your bargained for. By that I mean he&#039;d have bigger problems than the pigs.

				Irrespective of what the buyer did / done / said this vendor threats are just so unacceptable! <br /><br />This behavior can not be tolerated in any form and DPR needs to investigate and suspend the vendor until an outcome is determined. This really does undermine what SR stands for. <br /><br />I have never dealt with VMM and I can confidently say (IF proven), given his messages I NEVER will!

But having a list of clients and their locations can be handy- if you get swooped up by the popo and it&#039;s certain you&#039;ll be convicted, you could use the list as a little bit of leverage when talking deals. And of course, there&#039;s always that one asshole buyer who changes his feedback or holds it hostage for more product.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong- the practice of saving that sort of information is repulsive, and if we get a confirmation of this (which I doubt) there will be some action taken, but it&#039;s naive to think all vendors are totally moral people who only have their clients&#039; security in mind.

				I only ordered once by vortex and all i can say is that he seems to be legit and offered a high quality service and product....<br /><br />So i really don&#039;t understand stephancastles rating? Because all other costumers seems to be satisfied with vortex service &amp; Product.<br />&nbsp;I really like to see screenshots as a proof....<br />Maybe he is one of this buyers who are trying to get a refund or resend although they got a high quality product........?!?<br /><br />

While that alone may not be ban-worthy, storing addresses most certainly would be. Though OP still has yet to release a screenshot or even fully explain the situation, so it could just be a ruse to get free product or something.<br /><br />Until we get proof either way, I&#039;m sure DPR will deal with it if either of them goes to him.<br /><br />I assume the feedback in question is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finalized early - 25 days later Nothing. He insisted it would&#039;ve arrived days ago. Moral of the story - don&#039;t go out of escrow. Edit: Arrived a month later, without free item promised. Stayin at 2/5 because seller is quick to respond to messages, but only worried about his feedback, not the customers concerns. Also product was packaged in white scrap PAPER for a nice sticky mess and some waste! Great! Clearly this is a secondary/shrug off product I would steer clear. EDIT #3 - Reduced back to 1 for sellers attitude. Quote from seller in response to this review: &quot; PAPER??<br />Uhh dude, its called fucking PARCHMENT paper from the dispensary......<br />You&#039;re so full of shit with your reviews.....<br />Whatever.....fuck you now you get no free product&quot;<br />This sellers response left me confused, as I was not about the piece of scrap paper he shipped my wax in. There was text on it. Wax paper does not have text and is not white. Also he claimed to send me a free lollipop with my late shipment, which clearly never happened in the first place, as promised. All in all, if your looking for an integral seller who respects customers and will fix problems, avoid this one!

				wow, that&#039;s really fucked up shit. Sowwy to say but this needs investigating and appropriate action. It is not unreasonable to think that some sellers may get the idea that a nice address list is good leverage in case of getting popped. And after all, getting a lot of good feedbacks is primarily a means of protecting business interests, not protecting buyers out of the goodness of the heart.<br /><br />However, OP, I hope you can back this with screenshots...

				Not sure what the score is here, would love to see vortex respond but since he is established vendor I would give him the benefit of the doubt, but if there is anything to these accusations I couldn&#039;t&nbsp; think of a bigger transgression by a vendor than storing info and worse threatening getting the pigs involved. This would be the type of thing that would make me think hard if this was worth the risk and I&#039;m sure scare off a lot of potential new members. Not to sound naive because I&#039;m sure all vendors do not have same level of professionalism and are careless with info but there is enough info in forums and on SR to locate the most legit and hopefully trustworthy vendors. I really hope this is looked into and whatever party is full of shit is dealt with proper like.

				Im looking on his feedback and I dont see a low rating recently, other than 5 days ago... &quot;Marked this to &quot;in transit&quot; then ordered me to finalise before he sent it out, giving me zero buyer protection, even though I&#039;m on SR for 8 months, have had over $200 of transactions and a perfect record.

Until then it&#039;s hearsay and VMM doesn&#039;t need to defend himself against that. IF Sshots or links appear, and it&#039;s proven VMM is a c**t...

				I&#039;m thinking if the seller had done anything remotely like that we would have seen some screenies or other form of trying to convince us by the buyer. I doubt something that serious would be getting forgotten because of tea at grandma&#039;s around five...

				@SRE - with no verifiable proof.&nbsp; Call it what you like, but without actual tangible evidence to actually prove that there is ANYTHING other than a bitchy buyer trying to trash an established seller&#039;s rep in the forum (which is definitely the case, without proof), it&#039;s an empty accusation at best.<br /><br />This is only a serious accusation with a screenshot.&nbsp; Without it, this is somebody whining out of the wrong end of their body.....<br /><br />

				Alright guys here is the deal. Upon investigation, VortexMilkman did indeed threaten the user in question with action by the police. Because one of the main tenants of this site is not threaten buyers, his account had to be suspended. This is an unfortunate case because outside of this incident VMM has been a stand up Vendor here on the Road, but as peoples safety is our number one concern action had to be taken.<br /><br />~DigitalAlch

				Well I can only assume that the evidence must have been them looking at your conversation as stored in the database, and that therefor the conversation couldn&#039;t have been encrypted or else they wouldn&#039;t be able to read it.<br /><br />Any other form of evidence they could have is pretty much worthless, photoshop can make it look like you said anything and obviously anyone can put a block of text and say you said it.<br /><br />
