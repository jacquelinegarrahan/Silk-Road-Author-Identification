				Let me start by saying that I have been here since the begining I have spent thousands and I have never been better in my life since coming here. I have saved money and I have improved my health. I feel free and I am for the most part pain free. I have a chronic debilitating illness for which I can not get appropriate assistance through the traditional medical system. I have taken my treatment and pain management into my own hands and this is the best resource I have to support my life. Not my lifestyle, my life.<br /><br />Needless to say we have attracted a lot of attention, and it is only time that we are &quot;made an example&quot; by the DEA and/or other law enforcement agencies. It will be a disaster if this happens, after all you can&#039;t spell death without D.E.A. can you?<br /><br />I say it is time to take elaborate measures to ensure the long term existence of this wonderful place.<br /><br />I say we SUSPEND REGISTRATION OF NEW MEMBERS INDEFINITELY until a solution is created. I also say that registration should only be open during certain times. I do NOT reccomend &quot;invitation codes&quot; because it brings to much discussion of how to get these codes and asking for them, people selling them, and generally bringing more negative attention.<br /><br />New users just essentially took down Heaven for weeks. Some of us had thousands of btc that could have been lost. <br /><br />I want to petition DPR to begin looking into backing up information and servers and creating a system where if this address becomes seized or invalid or for whatever reason becomes compromised, everything is simply moved somewhere else.<br /><br />Security measures should be updated constantly and although I trust DPR I am also petitioning DPR to invest serious effort into a continued security management team that will have the task of analysing the sites code and looking for flaws. <br /><br />I am confident other members of our community can elaborate more on these issues and solutions to the problems we face now and in the future.<br /><br />Please use this thread as a forum to discuss the path that SR takes to remain a positive force in the world. This is not a security debate but a debate of mortality.

				It&#039;s not that simple as back it up and move it elsewhere.&nbsp; Also, what incentive do DPR and the admins have to stop the growth in volume on SR?&nbsp; It&#039;s a tradeoff between a smaller, somewhat more secure marketplace, and a larger, somewhat less secure marketplace that bring more money to the admins.&nbsp; And the difference in security from the admins perspective isn&#039;t big at all (more of a buyer/vendor issue with security).<br /><br />Businesses, such as the SR marketplace, don&#039;t make a habit of stopping growth so they can go into maintenence mode, especially when the option is available to simply keep growing.

				I&#039;m going to start with the honest and brutal truth. I hear what you are saying that you have been enabled to reach potentially life saving medication, but what you have to understand is that this is a money making venture. It was not put in place so people could readily purchase any drug/medication they desire whether it be used recreationally or for illnesses. From a vendors point of view, I will welcome new custom with open arms, nobody should be disallowed part of the pie because they were just too late.. If you knew your life saving medication were on SR for the taking but was denied registration would you be happy?<br /><br />One thing that does strike me though is the sheer brilliance of SR. It HAS enabled us to reach far beyond whatever our government controls and I&#039;m sure most people agree it is a middle finger to the man. Also I&#039;m sure DPR and his team are working solid to heighten the security for SR and I can see a good future for the venture. After all, if SR were to go down there is no income...<br /><br />Lastly if SR were to meet its demise then there would be no problems sourcing your items elsewhere. There are plenty other marketplaces and boards to visit and I&#039;m very sure many more will spring up if SR were to burn. <br /><br />Dank

				No need to get overwhelmed by paranoia fiend, it&#039;s in Silk Road&#039;s nature to get stronger as it grows. There will be many battles trust me! Hopefully, we will always win but life&#039;s too short to take shit for granted.

				DPR intended this market to be open for everyone, he doesn&#039;t want to limit who and who cannot access the road, trying to limit SR is kinda selfish IMO.

				This is DPR&#039;s boat, he will decide if and when decisions like this need to be made. If you have found such freedom, why then ruin it for someone else?<br /><br />It is not the philosophy of SR to be an exclusive dealer/buyer club with limited members, there are other forums/places for that, and if that is the kind of exclusivity you wish to see then by all means swim around the Deepnet and find them, good luck though! <br /><br />As for me I&#039;ll sail the seven seas on DPR&#039;s Black Pearl of Wisdom he&#039;s created, to bring freedom to those who don&#039;t have the means to get what they wish in a closed and monitored market and people like you don&#039;t understand you&#039;re just a small fish in the sea, what gives you the right to experience something and not someone else? <br /><br />Let&#039;s hope this gets deleted!<br /><br />

				I believe if The Silk Road gets TO big, it&#039;s going to start attracting a lot of unwanted attention. &quot;The first rule of fight club, is you do not speak about fight club&quot; kind of got pissed away when hundreds of people started posting about it around the regular web. I wish we could spread the word like wild fire, but I think shit&#039;s going to start happening if this forum starts becoming to mainstream.

				Making a mirror or cached version of the site would be pretty hard. An up to date mirror might also entail spider crawling/indexing that an anonymous community wouldn&#039;t want.

				But honestly, if you guys really want people to stop joining, put together a team of people to flood forms about how much you get hack while on TOR and how you never recieve product and how there is poison in the drugs, ect. <br />Asking DPR and who every else runs this thing to stop making the kind of money they are at an increasing rate is hopeless. I just joined a week ago so i really cant agree with out being hypocritical.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about it Vito.<br /><br />Silk road is the MySpace of the Illegal drug marketplace.<br /><br />It laid the pavement for secure, online drug marketplace&#039;s, and now the market is HUGE. But if something happens, and it goes down, it won&#039;t be long before another pop&#039;s up in it&#039;s place. Shit, I have a feeling, even if it doesn&#039;t go down something better will take it&#039;s place. <br /><br />Silk road is unreliable, they rarely make improvements to the site, the feedback system is rudimentary at best, they do almost nothing to prevent scammers, their search feature is horrible, and the list goes on.<br /><br />Facebook has to pop up eventually.

				1. as much of a pain in the arse the new users are in regards to the slowdown of the system and the endless repetition of the same questions and the repeatedly &#039;now i&#039;m in lets make it invite only&#039; (i fucking hate that one in particular - what makes these cunts think they are so special?), suspending new members indefinitely goes against the whole point of what DPR wanted to set up when he started.<br />2. there are already backup addresses in case vb5piz3r goes down - <br />silkroadiplkjo7t.onion<br />bpbpoqbqdodbqbqb.onion<br />pddqoboqqqqqbqdq.onion<br />i&#039;m not an expert in this field at all but perhaps theres a way to split the traffic between the addresses to cope with the influx?<br />3. all the alphabet soup authorites on Earth know about Silk Road and have done practically since it began, and all have a vested interest in taking it down because it&#039;s making them look useless. and yet we are still here. well, we would be if the fucking site lets me log in this morning<br />4. chill winston - it&#039;s the same everywhere; once somewhere becomes popular it&#039;s just a fucking nuisance to us that have been here ages. get some xanax in, that will stop your blood boiling so much. i highly recommend the 2mg ones - they knock me the fuck out :)
