				It&#039;s considered indecent and un-Christian to walk around with a big swinging dick in America. <br />So, you kind of have to own a firearm to keep lesser endowed men from harassing you because of their penis envy.<br /><br />Rather than buy a gun, I rather just hang out in areas where having a big swinging dick is not an issue. ;)

				I&#039;m pretty sure that even those who have a moral objection to dealing guns would agree that this is a better option than keeping them on Silk Road.

				Yupp, 40 is the way to go. I think it gives you the best manstop while keeping recoil and weight manageable. Huge fan of the HK UPS Compact.<br /><br />I rented a DE at the Gunstore in Vegas once, handed it back after three shots, the damn thing is just no fun to shoot. All show, no substance...<br /><br />I&#039;m still pro-gun regulation though :P

				it&#039;s close, but then .44 to .50 is like worlds apart. .50 is like anti-aircraft ammo lol. Depending on the driving load in your ammo that thing can drive a bullet through an engine block of a passenger car. .44 dun get that done...
