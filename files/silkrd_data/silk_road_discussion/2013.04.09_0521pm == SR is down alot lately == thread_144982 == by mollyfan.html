				Keeps timing out... What&#039;s going on? Everytime someone does &quot;maintenance&quot; to the site it seems to get worse and worse... I am NOT saying that the admins are causing it but from my side it looks as if its getting pretty bad... Anyone want to shed some light on this for me?

				I&#039;m guessing it has to do with the price of bitcoins. It keeps going up, so bitcoin keeps getting a lot of press, so people keep asking &quot;what can I do with bitcoin?&quot;, so SR is getting a lot of traffic. That&#039;s what I&#039;m guessing anyway; the SR staff are probably the only ones who know for sure how much traffic the site gets.

				from about 12pm - 11pm West Coast USA time everyone is trying to use the site, all that traffic makes it real slow.&nbsp; if you use the site outside of those hours it is quite shocking how fast it runs.&nbsp;

				I really appreciate you explaining that to me, I was honestly pretty baffled... But with all the money DPR makes, wouldn&#039;t you think he would invest in a few things to keep the site running? Load balancers or something? We all know the saying &quot;it takes money to make money&quot; right? Not knocking on DPR at all! I&#039;m very appreciative of the site and the money it makes me but don&#039;t you think it would make more money if DPR invested some?

If I&#039;m DRP and the SR staff, I am probably worried that investing too much back into the site right now could prove a bad investment if the primary revenue source dries up. <br /><br />2. If the U.S. legalizes cannabis outright, and profit margins for the road slip, is there a reason to maintain it?<br /><br />Of course, as other nations become a bigger part of the picture, an emerging cannabis market in the U.S. could actually benefit the SR given a larger number of suppliers willing to take the risks inherent in shipping abroad.&nbsp; Again, this is all just conjecture - but I&#039;m very interested to see how this all plays out.<br /><br />I love this place, appreciate it&#039;s purpose, and the effort that&#039;s gone into creating and maintaining it - but I just like to smoke weed (and a lot of it - our vendors can testify to my wife and I&#039;s habit), and once there&#039;s an open market for it I certainly have no reason to return.<br /><br />Is there a large enough base of other users consistently making purchases to keep the SR profitable (not counting previously existing profit and capital)?
