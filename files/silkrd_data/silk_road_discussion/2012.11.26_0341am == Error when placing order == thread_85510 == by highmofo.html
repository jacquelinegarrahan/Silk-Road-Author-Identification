				Hi,<br />New forum member but not new user here.<br />I have completed a decent number of transactions with various different vendors completely happily but for some reason recently when trying to order I receive the message <br />&#039;Error, Please log out, log back in and try again.&#039;&nbsp; After receiving this message repeatedly I am admittedly getting a little frustrated, I know I&#039;m doing nothing wrong as have completed orders before. Just wondering if anyone could suggest a reason why this is happening just to put my mind at rest a little. <br />It&#039;s almost more frustrating than when silk road was down completely as I can see exactly what I want, have it in my shopping cart and have the bitcoins ready to purchase it but am foiled at the last click everytime. <br /><br />If anyone can help thanks if not oh well I&#039;ll keep on trying. (it&#039;s like trying to catch a kangaskhan in the safari zone for gods sake haha)<br /><br />TLDR; when I click &quot;place order&quot; I get a message telling me &#039;error, log out then log in and try again.&#039;<br /><br />J aka Highmofo

				Also it sometimes tells me to select a postage option even though I already have, then when I try to place order again it gives me the error message.<br /><br />

				That was happening to me as well. Logging in and out didn&#039;t work, but restarting Tor entirely did.<br />Good luck!

				Cheers for the responses everyone, I was thinking that it could just be that SR is a little glitchy especially with all the new users after it&#039;s come back up. Good to know it&#039;s not just happening to me and I&#039;ll persevere with the in and out technique haha<br /><br />J aka Highmofo

				I&#039;m in the same boat. I&#039;ve tried logging in and out several times now. Hopefully, it&#039;ll work out.
