				I just don&#039;t understand everybody here at silk Road I&#039;ve been here on silk Road for about 4 months on and off I&#039;ve only made five purchases all weed and pretty much kind of got what I paid for if the guy was standing in front of me I probably would have not made the deal on three of the transactions.<br /><br />After my fifth purchase I met a vendor on the forms here he used to have a store on SR he left SR for reasons I do not know I think he said something about BTC being a ripoff OR a major pain in the ass.<br /><br />anyway my point is that I&#039;ve been buying from this gentleman for the past month and I must tell you I fill much more secure in the system that this guy uses he uses tor chat to communicate with you and you must call him on his burner phone either from a burner phone or other forms of phone communications that he will suggest to you that is secure. At first I thought this was a trap or something but after speaking with him for more than two weeks I thought to myself If this guys is the police then he has broken about five Laws just in conversations that we&#039;ve had and the fact that he makes you use tor chat and burner phones are phones with burner security like features to communicate with <br /><br />the orders are sent through tor chat&nbsp; in unison&#039;s with calling him on his burner phone to confirm order you are not allowed to discuss anything illegal over the phone he has a product list that has item numbers you&#039;re only allowed to discuss the item number nothing else.<br /><br />and just for you naysayers there&#039;s about 17 people on the forms here that use this Guy. <br /><br />His main rule is if you called the burner number he gives you and you do not recognize his voice on the other end hangup.<br /><br />This is the old school way of dealing drugs one-on-one I know him he knows me this is the way I feel it should be done there is no way after the first initial meeting of course that you can buy from anybody but the dealer you been buying from the whole time.<br /><br />you cannot say that about silk Road.<br /><br />But that first contact is a mother Fucker I will give you that I was pulling hair out waiting on that free sample he sent me but after that ordering was way better than silk Road.<br /><br />and you don&#039;t have some national DEA, LE and FBI and every other law enforcement agency on the planet with a big hard on to bust you for doing what SR is doing.sorry to tell you people this but silk Roads days are totally number just read the hidden wiki reports do you really think the DEA and the FBI are going to just sit around and let this go on and never do nothing about it I would not be surprised if the attack from today is an LE induced attack.<br /><br />watch over the next 2 to 3 weeks how many vendors will disappear or pullout or will have reports of them being arrested.<br />the game is up.<br /><br />if any of you fellow cannabis pot loving sweet leaf&nbsp; 420 friendly potheads want this guy&#039;s contact information send me a PM and I will respond with

This is total bullshit if the vendor gets arrested and they seize his computer and they find PGP encryption&#039;s day will make the vendor give up the PGP encryption keys and a few people really think that your vendor is following the rules then you are the most trusting and stupidest people I&#039;ve ever met.<br /><br />do you really think that a meth dealer or a coke dealer and especially a marijuana dealer who smokes all day is going to follow the rules this is a website full of people who do everything but follow the rules.

Then the week after same PTA meeting bring up the discussion about drugs see what kind of response you get I bet you $5000 that the discussion about pedophiles will last less than 30 seconds.<br />and the discussion about drugs will last for hours.<br /><br />drugs is a household name that has been Villinized by our government so much that it has been de-villainized 25 years ago you could not say the word drugs in public without being shunned today you can talk about drugs in preschool and church on TV any where you like.<br /><br />there are pedophile rings busted every day in United States that you never hear about.<br />but turn on the news any given day of the week and you will see something about a drug bust.<br /><br />So my friend you saying that LE not being able to bust pedophiles would be enough reason to assume that they won&#039;t go after silk Road is just uneducated guessing

				Follow these basic security principals always, and complications like this mean very little.<br /><br />1) Work within Escrow <br /><br />If you work within the escrow system, then you have the added relief of being able to receive support from the site administrators.&nbsp; Transferring bitcoins between user accounts is easy to do within the site.&nbsp; Transferring bitcoins back from some random bitcoin address is impossible. (like the quickpay address)&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not send coins straight to an address if you&#039;re purchasing anything.&nbsp; When you send money straight to an address, you might as well just call that a donation.<br /><br />2) Encrypt all communication<br /><br />There are many ways for attackers to pull information out of a website.&nbsp; Everytime the website is updated with a new feature new bugs can be introduced.&nbsp; While I personally think this is a javascript/sql injection issue, if you encrypt all of your communication straight to the vendor, then the attacker must have the VENDOR&#039;s private key, which is not contained within Silk Road.&nbsp; This way, the attacker can have access to the database, but cannot read any of the sensitive information. <br /><br />Its really that easy to stay safe.......... Escrow protects your purchases, and encryption protects your address.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you need help with setting up PGP encryption, or you want to test your encryption, PLEASE PLEASE reference this onion: http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;it has most of the PGP guides listed here in the forums, and has tools for testing your encryption as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />basically.... trust no one, and trust that the site is never secure.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck, Happy Hunting, Enjoy the holidaze<br />-wicked420

				We dont know much about computers, hacking and stuff, but is it safe to assume that, the pictures being put up had to have been done from the inside out?&nbsp; like someone on the inside changed them, I mean like a disgruntled employee or someone like that.<br /><br />We think if a hacker got into the site, they would wait for the right moment, or set things up, to make the moment right and take all the coins.Why waste your time with&nbsp; some weird quick-buy bullshit?&nbsp; Wheres the point in that? Also, is it all the same address that the coins are supposed to be sent to or a bunch of them, I cant get on Silk Road now, We seem to be having logging on issues but if it is the same address we can see how much they have scammed already. I assume some people don&#039;t use the forums and will log on, see no shipping option and send the coins to the address thinking this is a new update or something.<br /><br />This cant be too good.<br /><br />MM<br />

				Ok 420 I hear ya. These forums can be an inhospitable place lol.<br />No point going paranoid and trying to spread fear. I know nothing about tor computers etc correct but I know worrying about it wont help. Whoever runs this place isnt messing about. Theyve lasted years now and the sites still here so are you telling me LE have just been touching themselves all this time? Theyve most likely already dropped there biggest moves to bring down sr and they havent worked. Who knows how many steps dpr and his crew is ahead? Im pretty suee theyre a tiny little bit security conscious since getting caught will be a very long time in jail maybe even forever! Im feeling pretty good about the situation and im happy to leave the few hundred I have remaining in my sr wallet. <br /><br />And plus I think after seeing how many politicians/celebrities abuse kids and get away with it their whole lives (jimmy saville) maybe yes I am stupid to think LE give a flying fuck about stopping the really dangerous people instead of chasing a few pot heads and ravers whilst creating an unregulated untracable cash machine for anyone willing to be violent

				Tor as a software project has been around for 10 years. It&#039;s developed in the open and a large hacker and academic research community studies it. There are known potential attacks against Tor, but nothing that has been successful on the deployed network, despite the fact that it&#039;s a big target (the biggest anonymous network). As such, Tor seems pretty secure.<br /><br />We don&#039;t know that about SR. It&#039;s developed in secret by who knows who. We can&#039;t know if it is secure until something like this happens, and then we only know that it is insecure. This is an attack on the application layer, not Tor.

Whilst we appreciate the unprecedented challenges that you face keeping a market such as this online, this is a very serious issue that demands an explanation.<br /><br />Many thanks to inigo, however, for the initial announcement.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				My listings have been affected by this. I can confirm what was reported earlier; the altered images will return and shipping options will be deleted, even if the listings are manually fixed. I have been able to withdraw coins from the site still and I would ask that anyone who has an outstanding order with me, to finalize early. All placed orders have been sent and will be arriving within 2 days, but I would feel a little better not having money in escrow. It does take about 20-30 minutes for the listings to be corrupted and the site appears to be working normally, otherwise. If anyone is comfortable ordering, I will try to keep my listings clean, with shipping options. I will ask that you finalize early, but I will be able to get orders out before Thursday so they&#039;ll arrive by Saturday.<br /><br />Lastly, I have total faith in the Dread Pirate Roberts and so should you. I could write several paragraphs on why that is, but will save you all the time. This is certainly disconcerting and a large nuisance, as well, but it could be far worse and I&#039;m confident that DPR will come through.

Do you think its possible that the hackers took full control of the site but because of some security measures that DPR put in place they cant move the coins, and this is why the site is still up and why the listings have been changed to direct payment somewhere else. Also, all the mods are missing and from what we read the site has been having issues for months, maybe an employee went rogue or something.<br /><br />&nbsp;???

				As a Computer Science major it is clear to me that this is a result of a SQL injection exploit. Clearly, the hosting server needs to be patched because I&#039;m willing to bet it&#039;s using vulnerable software. It is possible, however, that this is a zero-day attack but I highly doubt that seeing as how we aren&#039;t seeing widespread mainstream attacks elsewhere on the clearnet sites. In other words: To fix this attack, take the server down and apply updates ASAP!<br /><br />Fortunately, if I&#039;m right in my assumptions, this attack is pretty harmless in the grand scheme of things. If anything, it is an important reminder of why it is always important to keep your software updated.

				Someone was saying SQL injection. How does hacker access the files at SR and able to edit the pictures like that? This means that they have already hacked into SR database and control of the files. Just imagine what they&#039;d do with your information. Either that someone got the hosted server&#039;s pass.<br /><br />I suggest each user of SR main can only create single user in the forum, or that the forum should be at least visible only to logged in members, not guest.

Perhaps you should read my previous posts, along with words 3 - 16 from my post you quoted. The last issue that sprung up here, regarding the moderators, had members calling for an explanation. In that case, an explanation was not required (you&#039;ll have to read the thread to understand why as I need my bed, I&#039;m afraid); however, in this case, an explanation IS required as the current situation is something that undermines trust in Silk Road, and undermines trust in vendors when a buyer sees a picture with &quot;SR QuickBuy!&quot; on it without knowing that there is a reason for it which falls outside of the vendor&#039;s control.<br /><br />Vendors pay commission to sell here, with customers paying that commission by proxy as it is factored into the prices charged; therefore, every one of us, both buyer and seller, needs an explanation as to how and why this issue has occurred. Perhaps you should spend more time researching how things work on Silk Road, thus giving you more insight as to why an explanation is required in this instance, and less time advising people to complain to their country&#039;s consumer protection agency.<br /><br />To reply to the rest of your post: yes, SR&#039;s success is indeed all about access and volume; we have 90%+ up-time, which, for a site such as this is absolutely remarkable. We also has a huge volume of sellers and buyers here, so we do have the volume.<br /><br />Yes, it is good that new people are here. Silk Road is not just a place to buy drugs, it is also the manifestation of a revolutionary idea and a hotbed of agorism - the more people that get exposed to that, the better.<br />And I presume you mean &#039;BMR&#039;, not &#039;BML&#039;. There is a very limited pool of potential buyers over there, and it is also rife with scams, mainly due to the low cost of obtaining vendor privileges.<br /><br />I&#039;m not entirely sure what any of your post had to do with the topic at hand though. This issue is not being caused by an influx of new members, nor has it got anything to do with access nor volume, so nothing that you said is even remotely related to the topic under discussion.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Private Listings seem to be unaffected by the hack and the site is working properly, other than the shipping and images. I still will ask for early finalization, just to be safe, but if you look at my vendor page, you&#039;ll feel very secure in doing that. As soon as the order is finalized, you can know that it will go out as soon as possible. Right now, as a test, I&#039;ll be offering 1/8 and 1/4 oz listings.<br /><br />1/8<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9ce7beec54<br /><br />1/4<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3a3068e01b<br /><br />Lastly, I encourage people to stop freaking out.

				I&#039;ve just gotten a message from someone who tried to buy through one of the private listings. In short, it does not work. He said that the shipping option can be selected, but then when the address is entered and the order is submitted, the buyer is taken to a blank order screen. His money stayed in his account and I received no order. So, the Private Listing idea is out.

				I&#039;ll repost my comment from another thread:<br /><br />I just wanted to say that I deposited money into SR today and it took 1.5 hours to get from instawallet to SR (which is the usual amount it takes for me to get a deposit on SR), so no worries there. I just placed an order and had no problems. I wouldn&#039;t panic and start cancelling orders and withdrawing all your BTC just yet. Everything seems fine. The vendor I just bought from had their most popular listings compromised by the hackers watermark (and the shipping options disappeared), but either they or the SR admins fixed something, because the shipping options reappeared and the watermark disappeared and I was able to order like normal.

Fuck yes it does and I don&#039;t even spend that much money on the road. I read in another thread a suggestion I think DPR should entertain which is to offer BTC rewards for people that can find security holes and vulnerabilities in the site so he can work on fixing them. He needs to be proactive about this stuff after this image hack. <br /><br />But I also realize that a site like this will inevitably always be a target of hackers and law enforcement and we always need to be aware of that as users of the site, and the admins of the site need to be especially aware of it and take all possible measures to protect its stability and security, just like we should take all possible measures to protect our own security including sending delivery addresses encrypted with the vendor&#039;s PGP key.

Time will tell. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sorry to have to disagree with you Abby, but this is not&quot;drug induced&quot; paranoia,&nbsp; <br /><br />Paranoia by definition is: <br />Psychiatry. a mental disorder characterized by systematized delusions and the projection of personal conflicts, which are ascribed to the supposed hostility of others, sometimes progressing to disturbances of consciousness and aggressive acts believed to be performed in self-defense or as a mission.<br /><br />2.<br />baseless or excessive suspicion of the motives of others.<br /><br />We know you were talking about number 2 because its safe to say that the majority of people on here have little to no real psychiatric issues. But, the fact is, the accusations and people being worried and or paranoid as you put it, are not baseless, Someone or some people did hack the website, with all the money on the site, little of which actually belongs to DPR and the countless lost sales to the top vendors, goes to show you&nbsp; how many &quot;bases&quot; these guys are on. How bad it is that something like this happens to the site? We think it may be a total game changer for everyone watching. We here at MM had been following the threads about the Road and its issues. never once was there any real info out there showing us that the site was, lets say: &quot;weak&quot;. But now there&#039;s no doubt, that the site has been compromised. Each and every buyer, vendor, LE agent, reporter and most importantly the hackers know this by now.&nbsp; Everyone who is against the Road is working overdrive right now trying to figure out how these people got in, where did they get to, are they still there, how did they do it ect.<br /><br />MM

				Disclaimer: I&#039;m running late so I haven&#039;t had time to read anything but the first and last page, so this might have already been said before:<br /><br />Just wanted to say it might be a good idea to, oh I don&#039;t know, post a tiny little warning on the front page so people don&#039;t give thousands of bitcoins to the hackers (which they almost certainly already have.) It could read something like:<br /><br />&quot;SITE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED. USE CAUTION.&quot;<br /><br />A fun project would be to record all the addresses in the contaminated images and see exactly how much money flowed into them as a result of this little scam.<br /><br />Glad I randomly decided to doublecheck the PGP key on a vendor&#039;s page against the one I already had saved before placing an order just now. Jesus Christ...

Just something to be on the lookout for, since the site has been, you know, hacked.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />But like CompSci said, they don&#039;t seem to have the ability to mess with anything else. If PGP keys started changing my faith would be shaken quite a bit. That would be as unnerving as fuck. This is small beans, I realize.<br /><br />I wonder if the site is on autopilot right now.<br /><br />(I take it everyone&#039;s gone somewhere else... Now to check the other threads...)

				Couple of things we must remember.<br /><br /><br />1. SR activity is small fry as far as LE are concerned&nbsp; - 20 million in a 300 billion dollar international trade is hardly ground shaking<br />2. LE would have to consider very carefully how much resource they dedicate to breaking this thing ? <br />3. Disrupting its activity would probably be a better option. <br />4. getting a whole bunch of pot heads paranoid as hell inst a difficult thing to do. <br />What happens when they get paranoid&nbsp; -&nbsp; they leave SR and go back out on the street where it is all the more dangerous and the chances of getting caught, a lot higher. <br /><br />Report from QLD Aus recently quoting from a classified report stating that technically interrupting SR would be difficult, costly and time consuming. Much easier to get a hand full of agents involved and disrupt things for the sole purpose of making them scared. <br />Quite clever actually. <br /><br />There is obviously LE agents reading this stuff and I say to them &quot; wouldnt your time be better spend dealing with real problems ?&quot;
