				I&#039;m interested in hearing peoples stories of being pulled over and searched by police.. As a avid pot smoker, it is absolutely my biggest fear and really the only way i will ever get in trouble. I&#039;m talking more on personal possession, no more then an 8th on me when traveling. <br /><br />Specifically i wanna know what happens after a cop says the usual &quot;do you mind if i search your vehicle?&quot;. Who has said &quot;i do not consent to a search&quot;, what happens after that? Do they let you go? Have they threatened to call the dogs on you? If they do call the dogs, what is the process of the search like? Details like that. I just wanna be fully prepared because i&#039;m in a college student in a college town known for clubbing/partying.&nbsp; It seems like LE gets a hard on for college kids after 11 pm.

				Very curious on this too. Never been pulled over while possessing, but I want to be prepared for the day.<br /><br />I have heard they will try to convince you into consent for a search, but you truly dont have to. They will scare you with threats, or offer lenience for cooperation, but I hear it&#039;s best to just stand your ground. Better to get arrested and freed, than to freely turn over evidence that will end up harming you more in the long run.<br /><br />Also heard answer questions with questions. &quot;Am I free to go?&quot; &quot;Can I call my lawyer?&quot; Keep a lawyers contact card with you even if you havent used him before. Theyre used to scaring the hell out of people who fold and make things easy for them. So stand your ground. They may give you shit and follow you all the way home, but without a warrant, I believe they cannot search your home or car unless there is an immediate threat (ie. domestic violence suspicion).<br /><br />Anyway, this is all just shit I&#039;ve heard. Would like to hear more from people who experienced it firsthand.

				When I was a teenager I was pulled over with something I didn&#039;t want to officer to find. As I looked very much like a suspicious character, he asked me if he could search my vehicle - to which I replied &quot;I&#039;d rather you didn&#039;t&quot; .... the officer then proceeded to try to convince me that my &quot;uncooperation&quot; gave him probable cause to search my vehicle - to which I laughed and asked &quot;so you can search anyone&#039;s car you want, huh? if they consent, you search it, if the don&#039;t consent then you have probable cause? I wonder what my lawyer would say about that?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;have a nice day, sir&quot;<br />

				Read up on your rights! We still have SOME left ;)<br />They can&#039;t search without consent UNLESS you have a warrant, parole, probable cause, etc.<br />I&#039;m in a legal state so when I&#039;m pulled over I just show them my doctor&#039;s recommendation, which works wonders. However that&#039;s likely not the case for all of us.<br /><br />Keep in mind that if you smoke in your vehicle the smell can qualify as probable cause.<br /><br />The easiest way to stay safe is to drive safe. If you have weed in the car put it in it&#039;s container and then in a paper bag and lock in a compartment (not w/ your registration).<br />If you are driving the speed limit, using your signals, stopping at stop signs and otherwise being a safe driver then there is no reason for you to be pulled over in the first place. <br />If you do get pulled over, be sure to ask what you were pulled over for and act accordingly. Don&#039;t answer questions unrelated to the reason provided, and do not consent to a search. <br />You ARE allowed to record your conversation with the police (hopefully in all states), so feel free to do so if you feel your rights are being violated.<br /><br />

				I smoke all the time.<br />Make sure windows are open.<br />Use a potable vape.<br />Never consent to a search.<br />Smell IS probable cause.<br />Edibles work well.<br />I have been searched by customs, found my edibles, and tossed then back.<br />They make a hell of a mess searching.<br /><br />I did get pinch as a teen ager had QP is glove box. <br />Dumb I know but it was my first QP.<br />We were pulled over and state cop started to hassle us.<br />tried to get search warrant. Let me go 2 hours into it.<br />Somebody stated they have 2 and 1/2 hours to get a warrant.<br /><br />Don&#039;t carry large amounts, not much is going to happen.<br />

				Never consent. Just say you dont have the time for this. Keep asking if you are free to leave. Keep asking. Ask again. Ask if you are being detained. Ask again. Ask if you are free to go again. There are states in which you can stop the police from searching your car, even if they have a dog. I have heard cases in which people have withdrawn consent and police had to stop and get a warrant. If they ask to search your car, then obviously they know they don&#039;t have enough to get a warrant... so why give them consent in the first place? <br /><br />Second. If you are ever transporting a large amount of anything that is less than legal, package it like you are going to mail it somewhere. Slap postage on it. Now that is federal property, and will need a separate warrant. Even if it isn&#039;t in a post box, its still mail. I&#039;ve heard of people moving marijuana plants in their car like this. Also, keep things locked in the glove box, or the trunk if you can. Those will need separate warrants and/or consent.

				If queried about a search, the best path to take is to offer a plain view search. (Check your lawbooks to get the specifics for your area)<br /><br />What this means is, you can designate areas that can and cannot be searched. To avoid suspicion or bogus &#039;probable cause&#039;, only allow the officer to look inside your cab, without touching or moving anything, or seeking an area that is not in plain site. <br /><br />This is pre-911 info thoough.., and now, since the 2012 NDAA budget has superseded Patriot Act law, additionally doing away with the 5th and 6th BOR amendments, we are living in very scary times. But local law enforcement is a different kind of corrupt, and from my experience know less about the law than most citizens. This can both help and hurt you. Especially since everything is; Government-badged upstanding officer of the &#039;law&#039; vs Joe Drug-user, you can&#039;t really rely on anything thats meant to &#039;protect&#039; us in this country.<br /><br />If you do get into some trouble, and&nbsp; the legality of anything the officer does is a concern, sign; Under Duress x&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />From my experience, I know someone who was pulled over for passing through a rec center parking lot 1 hour after it had closed. He had firearms in the back seat,not concealed, not a crime, and supposedly that warranted a search. He said the officer was lying to his trainee the whole time,and &#039;talking smack&#039; about the driver. I guess the officer was angry when he found out the guns were registered to the driver. So he ripped the car apart, and claimed the firearms were mistakenly reported stolen or something like that, and that the search had happened before the serial numbers were called in. Officer found what I was told was a less-than-smokable amount of crumbs, and the driver got fined for it, cursed out, told he was garbage,and sent on his way.&nbsp; &nbsp;This just goes to show that the situation is always a crap shoot, and that you are always at the mercy of someone elses mood, personality, morals and ignorance.<br /><br />

				different states have different laws. if you&#039;re carrying a small ammount, and are shitting bricks, you can always try to eat your nugs before the cop gets to your car.&nbsp; &nbsp;best thing to do is what davidd already said.

				I&#039;m my case, i always put everything i&#039;m carrying between my boxers and compression shorts for a close fit.. And if i have my vaporizer, i wipe it down clean with a wipe and put it in a bookbag, so its just a completely legal tobacco vaporizer. <br /><br />The first time i got pulled over, ever, i had my grinder with residue in it and a vape in my bookbag behind the drivers seat. My stupid ass did a rolling stop while talking on a cell phone (i know, very stupid), and a cop was behind me out of nowhere. I was less then half a mile from my house. <br /><br />Nervous as shit, i did the proper routine. Pulled over in a safe area, rolled down the window, turn off the car, hands on the wheel, and don&#039;t look around at all. Cop ask for my lis/reg, i give it to him and he goes back to his car for i swear it felt like 10 minutes. <br /><br />Then another cop pulls up, he almost looked like a narctoics officer. White guy with miami vice looking mustache with a collared shirt on. He stands at the passenger side window and the cop that pulled me over asked me to roll the driver and passenger side window down, obviously so the other cop could peak while i sign my ticket. Officer gives me a break with just one ticket, and he walks off, but the other cops stays for a minute. Ask me a few questions, i.e. education/ where did i work. Luckily my summer job is fucking perfect to tell a cop for a YBM in college so after i told him what it was he said okay have a nice day. <br /><br />I&#039;m assuming i did not get asked to be searched because <br />1: i have a squeaky clean record<br />2:I didn&#039;t act or look nervous, but i was scared shitless<br />3: I was in school and had a decent job<br /><br />After that experience i&#039;ve straightened my carrying up to where i&#039;m not worried about being searched, however i am worried about them calling in dogs. Because if i&#039;m carrying and they call in dogs and they alert, i&#039;m sure they would want to tear my car apart. Thats why i would consider consenting if i&#039;m confident that they won&#039;t find anything because its all on my person. Do dogs actually get called in often when someone does not consent?

				Unless you have a warrant or are driving a stolen car or something, they&#039;re not going to call in dogs just on a routine traffic stop.&nbsp; Also if they search your car they are going to make you get out, at which point there is 99% probability you will at least be patted down.&nbsp; That is why if I&#039;m driving while holding and I have a passenger in the car, I ask them to carry whatever it is.&nbsp; Every time I&#039;ve been pulled out of a car when I have a passenger, they pat me down/search me but not the passenger.

				I got pulled over with a small amount of personal use weed and a pipe on me on the interstate by a state trooper.<br /><br />When he pulled me he went through the usual B.S. checks my license and I wasn&#039;t worried at all, thought I was just going to get a speeding ticket. When he comes back and tells me to get out of the car now I&#039;m starting to think somethings up. He asks me if I smoke cigarettes, and I answer yes. Then he ask if I have a pack he can see. I tell him that there in the center console of my car. So he ask if he can see it and I stupidly say yes. He then opened my bag sitting in the passenger seat and found my weed and pipe. Well this was not a very weed friendly state and I got a free trip to the county jail.<br /><br />I never gave him permission to search my car only to check for my pack of cigarettes. He later said that he smelled the weed and had probable cause. I know that&#039;s not true because I hadn&#039;t smoked in at least 3 hours and the windows were open the whole time.<br /><br />I was young and dumb back then and have learned a lot since then. Know your rights and only break one law at a time.

My car doesn&#039;t use a normal key. It uses one of those smart keys so there is no actual key. The glove box key is hidden inside the smart key. I had to read the manual to even figure it out, its very unlikely a cop will be able to. They need separate and specific consent for locked glove boxes and locked trunks. <br /><br />In some states they may be able to tow the car if there is suspicion you are under the influence but for merely refusing a search then you are simply enacting your 4th amendment rights which is not illegal. If you feel your rights have been violated, or that you are being treated unfairly or illegally, NEVER physically resist. Spend a night in jail. They put Martin Luther and Gandhi in jail and look like idiots now. Civil disobedience.<br /><br />You can be arrested for driving high. My own state is like this, although I have never heard of anyone being caught or tested.

				Whoa, This is an interesting thread. I kid you not when I say this, but I have been pulled about 20&#039;ish times. I honestly have lost count. I have some pretty crazy stories. I wont start on any of them 2nite since I am half asleep right now. Long story short I have an electrical compartment in my car which holds a great amount. I have been safe after I found my friend that builds custom stash spots in vehicles.
