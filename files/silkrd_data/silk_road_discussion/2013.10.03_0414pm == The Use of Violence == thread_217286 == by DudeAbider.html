				It&#039;s a situation we all try to avoid, violence occurring over a drug transaction.&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly certain that I&#039;m not the only one who&#039;s been held at gunpoint by someone more willing to deliver a fatal bullet than the drugs they agreed to.&nbsp; And what&#039;s stopping them besides more violence?&nbsp; Would you find a sympathetic ear at the police station?&nbsp; &nbsp;No, they&#039;d tell you that the punishment fits the crime and if you go looking for *ILLEGAL* drugs that you deserve to get shot.<br /><br />For those of us that have been fortunate enough to find the Silk Road marketplace, the threat of violence is almost completely non-existent.&nbsp; If vendors want to dominate the marketplace, they bring higher quality merchandise or lower prices rather than using violence to stomp out the competition.&nbsp; Buyers have the stat system, giving them access to vendors at all levels of the drug food chain if the vendor also chooses to do business with them.&nbsp; By the DEA&#039;s own admission, the drugs they obtained from 100+ buys were of high purity, something they can&#039;t routinely claim from street level busts. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m as taken aback as the rest of you about recent documents released indicating that there were at least two attempts by the alleged DPR to take out those who acted against our collective best interests.&nbsp; But then I realize that the site was designed to take a percentage off of the thousands of drug transactions that take place, so obviously admins are going to have a nice sized fund to deal with any and all problems that arise.<br /><br />Without getting too much into the details of the alleged incidents, as we only know what the crooked prosecutors have released as part of their smear campaign, does the community agree that the site administration can and should use ALL means necessary to ensure its future?&nbsp; I certainly hope the community stays intact and that a SR 2.0 rises from the ashes regardless of whatever comes out about their alleged DPR investigation.
