				I saw that there&#039;s a app for TOR on my android phone.. it&#039;s called &quot;Orbot&quot;... would it be safe to view SR on that app on my phone? I haven&#039;t done it, just curious!

				I have used this app before to view Sr and a view other sites, and it is essentially as good Tor, to my knowledge.. just make sure to use the special browser app Orweb with it. <br />Also be sure to select &quot;proxy all through Tor&quot; in Orbot. <br />hope this helps.

				Hmm... I&#039;m not convinced any mobiile phone is secure at the best of times, so it goes against all my inbuilt alarms to access SR from anything other than my VM etc.<br /><br />Why would you need to access SR from your phone anyhow? Sorry if I&#039;m being ignorant, but you&#039;re not still so excited by SR that you&#039;ve got to take it everywhere and show your mates? Because that&#039;d be just plain fuckhead-ish!

				A) Orbot on Android is a convenient way to connect to the Tor network from your Android phone<br /><br />B) It&#039;s REALLY REALLY REALLY insecure. It&#039;s very dangerous. I keep telling people here and there&#039;s many threads on it, but basically it&#039;s just a tool to access Silk Road but you loose EVERY protection that you get from using Tor on a Windows / Mac / Linux desktop computer. <br /><br />There&#039;s several reasons for this from network triangulation to default Android browser insecurities (the default Android browser doesn&#039;t block scripts for example).<br /><br />C) Basically don&#039;t do it unless you really know what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />D) If you do it from an Android phone which isn&#039;t rooted then you deserve what&#039;s coming for you.

				Have been using it for months. No problems so far. Even made orders off it and I&#039;m not in jail....yet. I really should just use the computer though for transactions.<br /><br /><br />

				I use Orbot on my Samsung tab occasionally.&nbsp; Great for browsing Silk Road through the free wi-fi offered by Maccas.&nbsp; Not real keen on using Orbot on a personal phone.

				I would only use orbot if it&#039;s on a rooted phone with a custom ROM with built-in encryption. I have been using it since I rooted my HTC and have had 0 issues thus far. As stated earlier use the Orweb app for a browser as well.

				I use it. There are a couple of key factors to remember though. <br />Only use it over Wi-Fi, turn mobile data and GPS off. <br />Only is safe if your phone is rooted with a custom ROM and you give it super user access. <br />You have to use it with the OrWeb browser<br />I do not know of an easy way to do PGP on Android. <br />Although I believe it to be secure, there is no way it is more secure than a live-USB<br />The more devices you use to access silk road the more tracks you have to cover.
