				Hi, <br /><br />New here.&nbsp; Used the search, but it seems a bit limited.&nbsp; I know answers are there, but if anyone can direct me to good FAQ/Thread on basics like:<br /><br />bitcoins - how to use and how the rate changes<br />using SR<br />Escrow?<br /><br />Thanks

				Also painfully new, and I can&#039;t seem to log onto the Silk Road at all. Whether this is because the address I have isn&#039;t actually the Silk Road but a phishing one I&#039;ve yet to find out. <br /><br />Any help with the correct link to the Silk Road would be greatly appreciated!

				Yes ALWAYS look for the &quot;silkroadvb5piz3r.onion&quot;<br />Even when you are certain, one small mistype could lead you to a phish. <br />Luckily the url is easier to remember.&nbsp; In the past it was easier to overlook.
