				This is concerning the official SR message:<br /><br />&quot;So the server went down unexpectedly today. This was very unnerving because we thought it had somehow been seized or something terrible like that. Fortunately it was just some kind of glitch and we were able to reboot. Everything has been backed up and is totally current, but we are not going to turn the site back on for a couple of days while we work out a way to prevent such problems. We are terribly sorry for this inconvenience, but we want to provide the best service possible, and random outages just aren&#039;t going to cut it. We know it must be terribly frustrating, but we are taking the better-safe-than-sorry approach and we hope you understand.&quot;<br /><br />We Anonymous, were testing our new WebLOIC on several sites including The Silk Road and The Underground Wiki.&nbsp; This is not the hoax #refref.&nbsp; <br /><br />We apologize for the inconvenience of it may have caused to SR users.&nbsp; Take this as a warning to those who host CP on darknets.&nbsp; We will take you down.&nbsp; We have the means.<br /><br />We are Anonymous<br />We are Legion<br />We do not Forgive<br />We do not Forget<br />Expect Us

				Ha!<br /><br />What a macaroon.<br /><br />Just so folks know, this is a copy of an old message - 3 months old - that was up on the surface web at hxxp://silkroadmarket.org/ when the server gacked.<br /><br />Also, anyone with a lick of tech knowledge knows that the LOIC doesn&#039;t work to take down tor sites. Far too much latency, and relies on protocols not supported by tor.<br /><br />But nice troll, better luck next time.

				lol at linking to a thread that discredits him all the way... I agree .. look at the thread people.<br /><br />Its obvious this is either LE, or some Christian (or Muslim) religious zealot, posing as anon (who never would attack here).<br /><br />Basically, someone is trying to make SR and anon suspicious of each other.<br /><br />Nice try n00bs.

				Hey come on, that is unfair. just bcuz the guy is pissed the site was down, doesn`t make him pedo.<br />I support your action agaist CP, but I wanted to place an order today but the site was down, and now the listing is removed and I`m still pissed about that. You should test against pedo sites if that`s who your going after anyway.

				I don`t know how to get IRC working over TOR, but the sites are on hidden Wiki, under section ``Hard Candy``. I do not go to that myself but it is talked about that it is there on TOR message boards.<br /><br />EDIT: you can find Hidden Wiki with the core.onion
