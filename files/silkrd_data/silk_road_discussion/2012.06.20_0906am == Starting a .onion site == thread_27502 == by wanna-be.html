				Have you tried using this wonderful reservoir of knowledge called Google? Or you&#039;re just trying to get your post count to increase on these forums?<br /><br />Besides, judging by your previous posts, you&#039;re nowhere near technical enough to be starting any sort of services. Judging by the same posts, I really dislike you, if you catch my drift.

				It&#039;s explained on the TOR website.. https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en but i agree with msft1 that you need some knowledge on how to set a linux server on a vps .. etc <br /><br />Google is your friend.

				are you sure the others don&#039;t sell your data ? ;)<br />it&#039;s all about the money, bi*** (as said that often)<br />you&#039;re surfing w/o an ip, great can you give me your tcp-ip(rotocol), i would like to know all about that, please share :P<br /><br />@topic:<br />if you&#039;re trying to set up an onion website, you should try it out locally first. set up an (apache) webserver and get your .onion-address, the link how to set it up was given by ilovelsd69 and I agree with rest, why not doing some research on the web before asking ? :) problem will probably appear in practice, than you can come back and ask some &quot;useful&quot; questions. (no offense, but sometimes there are &quot;useless&quot; questions....)

				I&#039;m hosting several websites and running a few servers. I&#039;m working as freelance network/security administrator, programmer and all the IT-related shit, also got my own experience with hosting in the onion-network :)<br />I feel qualified to set up an own server and some crazy people out there also pay me for doing so ^^<br /><br />I agree that freedom hosting is the easiest way to get an onion address + space, but i like to have my hostings in my own hand :)

They are, after all, commercial rivals (unless it&#039;s all a conspiracy and they&#039;re all Google/Bilderberg OH NOES!!!!1)
