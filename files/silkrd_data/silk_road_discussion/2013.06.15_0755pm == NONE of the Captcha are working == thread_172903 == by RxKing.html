				If I&#039;m not mistaken this is because the captcha &#039;times out&#039;?<br /><br />I&#039;ve had this problem for quite some time, logging in and when captcha was implemented for messages.<br />(On the SR site, not the forums)<br />Usually it works if the page is reloaded and the captcha is immediately entered.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				ya...<br /><br />although we needed some stops or blocked for spammers....had 30-40 viagra messages in one day this is terrible !!! does not work anyways, as yet and a real nightmare for busy vendorss..<br /><br />can I at least suggest that vendors should not have this on their accounts ?<br /><br />I mean you gotta be a dedicated spammer to spend $500 on a vendor account...correct ??

				i actually have a solution for this, quoted from a post i made in the newbie forum<br /><br />&quot;<br />so i searched the forum and realized that others were having this same problem, but no one ever posted a response.<br /><br />for some reason even though I enter the image verification correctly every time, it wouldn&#039;t work for the life of me, whether i listened to the letters or just clicked request another image<br /><br />i FINALLY found what works<br /><br />drag the letters (the graphics box) into a new tab, different letters will show up from whats on the reply site. use the letters from the new tab<br /><br />should work now<br />&quot;
