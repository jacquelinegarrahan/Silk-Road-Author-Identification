				Title: <strong>Advice for low-volume vendors?</strong><br />

				Hi All, <br /><br />I&#039;ve just started out as a low-volume vendor of prescription stimulants (adderall, ritalin, etc), cannabis, and mushrooms. I&#039;ve been a buyer for a while. So far sales are going well, but I was wondering if there are any other low-volume vendors out there that are willing to part with some advice. Or perhaps the high-volume sellers could also chime in and give us input as to how we can fill market niches that high-volume vendors can&#039;t.<br /><br />It&#039;s too soon to tell, but I&#039;m worried that the market is hard to penetrate without a known name and reputation. Low-volume vendors will never best high-volume vendors in this regard. I also worry that low-volume vendors will be forced to sell for less. <br /><br />As a new vendor, any advice is greatly appreciated!

				Spend a lot of time on your profile page. It is a one time time investment that lasts forever.

				Thanks, that&#039;s a good suggestion. It also seems to me that though low-volume, a vendor should be as consistent as possible.

				Are you seeking to be higher volume or are you happy where you are? What do you want out of this?<br />I completely agree about the consistency.

				If you can afford it, I would think doing a generous amount of samples and posting on the forum DAILY would be a big help.&nbsp; I trust vendors who I interact with frequently more than a person I&#039;ve never interacted with on the forums/site.&nbsp; I think doing that would at least give you a loyal following of at least a few people.

I am selling quite a bit without much of a presence on the forums thus far. I will start a vendor thread within a week or so, though.

However shipping costs might outweigh the benefits there

				Thanks for the link.&nbsp; I forgot what you were selling, as I&#039;m a cannabis only man.&nbsp; But I&#039;ll be glad to check you out when you get that up and selling.&nbsp; Good luck at any rate.
