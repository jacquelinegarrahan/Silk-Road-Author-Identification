				Hello everyone. <br /><br />So, I&#039;ve been following SR with interest for the last few months, and I was thinking of moving my &quot;business&quot; over to this site, as I would like to minimize my risks of being caught. I&#039;ve been dealing for a number of years in the &quot;real world&quot;, in pretty much everything you can get high on (some in greater amounts than other). However, I&#039;ve dealt mostly in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway and Finland, to be precise) and I would like to continue to sell in these countries, as I can get the wares easier to their intended destination this way, while remaining anonymous. <br /><br />But is there a substantial amount of Nordics on SR? I imagine it&#039;ll be mostly Americans and people from the EU, mainly the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands. And I&#039;d rather not send my packages across too many countries, and try to keep it &quot;local&quot;. <br /><br />Excuse my English, and thanks for reading. Any answer would be welcomed. <br /><br />(I assume this is the correct section to post this in?)

				There&#039;s definitely an active user base, I&#039;m surprised at how many of my customers come from there :)

				Have you seen the prices here?<br /><br />MDMA is 300-500 SEK per gram on here, in Sweden the standard price is 1000, 1200 is not unheard of.<br /><br />Amphetamine costs 50-100 SEK a gram, in Sweden the standard prices are 200-300.<br /><br />LSD costs 50-60 SEK, in Sweden the standard price is 100-150:- <br /><br />I pressume the prices are about 20-30% higher in Norway and probably higher in Finland as well.<br /><br />The scandinavian people who find themself on silkroad probably wouldn&#039;t pay much of a premium just for having it shipped from Sweden. Don&#039;t forget the fee silkroad takes, the fees for exchangers etc. <br /><br />Why go through all the hassle selling of selling a gram of amphetamine for 100 SEK on here when you could sell it for 200-300 &#039;in real life&#039;? The only thing worth doing would be to sell something that there&#039;s a demand for on SR, maybe pharmaceutical opioids? I haven&#039;t seen a lot of them here and they seem to be common and relatively cheap in Sweden compared to the prices I have seen here. <br /><br />Send me a PM if you want to ask/talk about anything, I don&#039;t sell on here but I&#039;ve been around a while. (I&#039;m Swedish btw)

				The only way to find out is to make some trial listings.

				Tell us what you&#039;ll be selling in the Product Offers section. It&#039;s the best way to probe your market. Good luck out there.<br />-gH-

				Looking at vendor pages there are a lot of people who explicitly mention the Nordic countries, so you have to assume they get inquiries.<br /><br />Personally, weed from a Nordic source would be a big win.&nbsp; Germany/Spain are close, but not as close... Long mail times and smelly cannabis across borders seem to be a bad combination for personal security.<br /><br />The big challenge there IMO, which another poster mentioned, would be price and profits on your side.&nbsp; Even with the SR fees, shipping, etc you can find primo bud on SR shipped from the EU that&#039;s about half the price decently connected people are paying on the street here.&nbsp; While I personally would pay a little premium for the short shipping distance some people are more price conscious, and you&#039;d be competing with the other EU vendors.<br /><br />There are a lot of Scandinavians on here, and not too many Nordic sellers, so there&#039;s opportunity.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anecdotally I saw a Norwegian vendor pop up some a cannabis listing that was sold out in a few days...<br /><br />I&#039;ll agree with the other posters: test listings and the product forum are probably a good place to start.

				Yes, there is a relativly big scandi userbase here. I&nbsp; would happily pay a premium for having it shipped domesticly (Norway).
