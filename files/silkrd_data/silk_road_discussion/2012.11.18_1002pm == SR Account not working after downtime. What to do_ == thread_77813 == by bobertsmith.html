				Finally can get back on SR but when I try to login it is reporting that my login is incorrect. I know for sure that it is not. Is there someone who can help with this? I had some bitcoin in my account and also a pending order which has not been received. I would very much like to get access again. Please help!

				Did you by any chance try a &quot;faster&quot; SR link that was posted in the forum a few days ago?

				I don&#039;t believe so. I have the SR address bookmarked in Tor and use that bookmark only. <br /><br />I assume you might be suggesting that a phising link was posted and others used it and thus gave out their un/pw? I don&#039;t recall doing anything of the sort. Only kept up on the messages about the downtime. <br /><br />Thinking I&#039;ll create another account and email the staff and see what can be done.

				Yup. The thread was like a slow motion car accident as people one after another ignored the warnings and lost their accounts.
