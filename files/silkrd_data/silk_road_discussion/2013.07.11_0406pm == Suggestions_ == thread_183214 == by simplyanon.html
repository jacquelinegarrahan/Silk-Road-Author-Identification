				Alright, I orderd some nbmoe tabs from T5. His reputation seemed solid, so I was like, sure, why not. Over two weeks later, my order is 5 hours from finalizing and no one has seemed to notice my extension efforts. One of my resolutions expired, and two are currently just sitting there, being ignored. Ive moved the order to resolutions but no extensions have been granted even though Ive offered three. I still have not received my package and the order auto finalizes in 5 hours. I was hoping to get it today, but the mail came and, nope. So, SilkRodians, dafuq do I do? 30+ orders and over a year of shopping and Ive never not had an order arrive so I&#039;m kinda at a loss, all I know is I dont want the order to be finalized without product in hand, but it doesn&#039;t look like a possibility at this point :(

				Once an order is in resolutions, it won&#039;t auto-finalize. <br /><br />If your last entry before the review period begins is for a 100% refund and the seller never countered, SR resolutions will grant you your refund. <br /><br />You may want to put a note in your final resolution entry for SR resolution staff to consider NOT allowing this refund to affect your purchasing stats on account of vendor non-responsiveness. It&#039;s a similar situation to a vendor going AWOL and leaving many patrons with unfilled orders. In those cases, the refunds aren&#039;t reflected on those patrons purchasing stats.&nbsp;

This will not reflect on your purchasing stats as a refund. It may turn into a game of trust if the vendor requires you to finalize first and then the vendor will refund you using the funds you just finalized. You can give him/her a certain time frame in which to accomplish this before leaving a 1/5 for non-compliance. The effect of a 1/5 is immediate. So that is generally incentive enough for the vendor to execute this transfer in a timely manner. Figure on anywhere from instantly up to 24 hours.

Question i would in fact be receiving the funds to my account via him sending me BTC off of his account? Did i understand that correctly?
