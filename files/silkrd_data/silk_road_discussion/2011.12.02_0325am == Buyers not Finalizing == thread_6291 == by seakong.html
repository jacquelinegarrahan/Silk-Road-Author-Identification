				Anyone else have this problem?<br /><br />I have a boat load of buyers who receive their product then wait the 17 days for the auto-finalization.<br /><br />I am considering asking to release escrow before shipment but I feel I do not have enough feedback or reputation to qualify for such a request. <br /><br />It is just plain annoying to have your funds tied up for half a month due to buyer ignorance<br /><br />

				As a vendor who ships internationally I&#039;ve had this experience where it seems like buyers are waiting until the last minute to finalize. One could assume malice or realize that sometimes it actually takes that long for mail to get delivered. If I ship via regular post from a rural area in Western Canada to a rural area in the South-East United States then it&#039;s certainly possible to take 17 days. <br /><br />If you think about it, 17 days can span over three weekends which brings it down to 11 business days. A little longer than estimated 6-10 for international shipments between the US &amp; Canada but well within reason. <br /><br />I prefer to attribute late finalization as being the fault of Canada Post and/or USPS rather than malicious buyers. They have nothing to gain by being slow to pull the trigger on finalizing.

				Point taken. Real life happens. As vendors we know what&#039;s up. After 2-3 shipments you should remember. This area takes x days. This area takes x days. I ship faster out west than I do up north. Same places take 3 days on an OVERNIGHT EXPRESS. It&#039;s all about where you live and if your postal carriers actually care to deliver for you.<br />&nbsp;I have had INT&#039;L shipments take longer. But I knew that going into it. AfricanBushDoctor for example. Takes a long time. NOT A BIG DEAL when expected. But buyers getting caught up for any reason too many times is out. 17 days is a long time. I send a DCN and expect/ really want buyers to finalize and release escrow early. On time at the very least.&nbsp; 3-5 working days mainly. BUT I AM A PROVEN TRUSTED VENDOR. Unscrupulous bastards could send you strips of paper in the mail w/a dcn so beware. Sh*T! I hope I didn&#039;t just give someone any ideas. <br />&nbsp;<br />I just can not wait 17 days for every order. Drop um like they are hot! Word will get out and peeps will straighten up.

				..a suggestion is perhaps users don&#039;t know the ins and outs of finalising ...to be honest reading the buyers guide on SR its not obvious how the payment and finalising actually works; reviewing the forum discussion groups its not obvious where this is to be discussed neither.<br /><br />it seems to me that i would figure this out by browsing around the forum reading everyone else&#039;s posts, and perhaps not everyone spends the time to research this...<br /><br />its obviously a 2 part process of participation.<br /><br />reading above/previous comments perhaps buyers haven&#039;t realised how the delays impact on when sellers get paid.<br /><br />in the average users defence they all cant all be expect to be experts in everything from internet security, to payment methods, pgp......etc etc -there is a lot to be taken in.<br /><br /><br />amen<br />

				Wow - this thread has proved to be very beneficial on my end. Many of my customers have just finalized early in response to this post and this only further motivates me to support the community. <br /><br />To all those who just finalized, you know who you are and you won&#039;t be forgotten.

				I think it&#039;s important that newbies be advised in a serious manner to finalize within no more than an hour after receiving product, and there should be a penalty for autofinalizing.&nbsp; At least now you can see that in our--buyers--profile.&nbsp; This is one of the causes of vendors insisting on newbies bypassing escrow, and as a buyer I hate that people don&#039;t realize they have a responsibility to finalize *now*, not after partying all weekend.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve always taken this seriously, and feel there should be some warning or other &#039;sign&#039; that tells new buyers--or old lazy buyers--to finalize as soon as they get package.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never autofinalized and have little sympathy for those who do: they are the ones causing sellers to insist on early finalizing.

				If anyone is NOT doing it, I would definitely recommend asking buyers to finalize if you&#039;re confident they&#039;ve already received the product.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing most are newbies that either don&#039;t know the procedure or have forgotten to finalize after getting the product and getting wasted hehehhe.

				I have a buyer that is 1 day away from auto-finalization and I feel bad for him because (1) He probably didn&#039;t read the guide properly and doesn&#039;t reealize that he has to finalize whenhe receives it. (2) Even worse, He hasn&#039;t read my messages urging him tto either finalize if he&#039;s receivedd it, or go to the resolution center so that he isn&#039;t hit with a high auto-finalization rate... which I guess would be 100% since this is is first purchase.<br /><br />I&#039;m not entire cetain if his rate is going to be 100% but no matter what happens he&#039;ll probably have to abandon that buyer&#039;s account.<br /><br />It&#039;s a small purchase ~$30 so not a huge deal for me that I haven&#039;t gotten the money yet. My concern is geared towards the buyer.

				Just to chime in as a new buyer. With a lot of sellers not selling to people with high auto-finalization rates and what not. I found the best method is to treat each deal on here as I would with my RL dealer. Order placed, money transferred. SR has enough things in place that if something goes wrong it can be dealt with quickly. Lucky for me I did my due-diligence by researching and lurking for a few months before even thinking of making my first purchase. As others have said I think there is just an influx of new buyers that aren&#039;t doing the proper research and in the end cause sellers a little bit of a headache.<br /><br />That&#039;s just my .02 bc from the view of a newbie.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m with Dark Star on this. I am a new buyer as well, just made my first purchase! I also did a few months of lurking and research before doing this transaction. I feel I am pretty familiar with what needs to be done such as finalizing my order as soon as it arrives (probably be sampling it as SR loads for me to finalize&nbsp; ;) )<br /><br />But I know how impatient people can be and rush into things without knowing what entirely what is going on. Maybe they should receive some kind of notice letting them know how important is that they finalize their order so that their vendor gets paid and how it can reflect badly on them if they let it auto finalize.

				Finalizing within an hour is nice, but I work and go to school so I&#039;m kind of busy too. Plus I want to try the product before finalizing because I got fake meth here and not finalizing before I tried it kept me from getting scammed. So far, I have always finalized within 24 hours. <br /><br />Now I can&#039;t get on the damn site to finalize. The vendors will have to wait for their money through no fault of mine and should get on SR&#039;s ass to pay for some real servers that don&#039;t fucking crash every week. You guys are losing money every time the site goes down.
