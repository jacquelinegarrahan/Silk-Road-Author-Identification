				We&#039;ve been having problems with some users being randomly logged out of Silk Road over the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; We&#039;ve worked up a patch that I hope will solve the problem and will be taking down the site momentarily.&nbsp; If you experience any bugs after this update, please post them here asap.&nbsp; Thanks!

				I see that the people who got the error message:&nbsp; &quot;Sorry, an error was encountered&quot; seem to have all reported it on 7/22.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say for absolutely certain, but it was probably that same day that I got that same message when trying trieo get to the SR site.&nbsp; I figured the site was down and hoped it was only for maintenance or similar, then checked some tormail, went back to SR page after that and got the log in page no problem.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t really give it much thought as everything looked the same inside.<br /><br />Unless anyone or DPR knows of anything to have caused it to be concerned about, I&#039;m not...&nbsp; and I&#039;m sure he would let us know if there were.
