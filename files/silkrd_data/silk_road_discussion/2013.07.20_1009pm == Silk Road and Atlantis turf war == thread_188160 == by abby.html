The don is under threat, wounded by a series of attacks, with key players swapping sides and prices undercut by a hungry young rival. He lashes back: the newcomer “gets no respect from me” and the dealers watch carefully for shifts in power.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This, however, is not a battle fought with weapons on street corners. The fight is for ownership of one of the darkest corners of the internet, where high-grade drugs at street-level prices are available at the click of the button.<br /><br /><br />After more than two years of undisputed leadership, Silk Road – the one-stop shop for drugs, porn and dodgy documents described as an “amoral eBay” – is facing a challenge from a rival hungry for a slice of its multimillion-pound revenues. Established in 2011 by a shadowy founder known as Dread Pirate Roberts, Silk Road has been a business success story. It has provided anonymity to its users and sellers on a sub-layer of the internet unreachable by normal search engines such as Google.<br /><br /><br />Now a new start-up, Atlantis, has copied many of its features but changed the rules with an unexpectedly public promotional campaign and financial incentives to dealers to switch to its marketplace.<br /><br /><br />Founded by libertarian activists with backgrounds in business, technology and drug dealing, Atlantis stepped up its offering last month with a YouTube advertising campaign and a question and answer session with its anonymous chief executive officer. The advert – featuring an animated figure called Charlie the stoner – led to rapid growth with 500 sign-ups a day and 50,000 registered users, according to a senior figure at Atlantis, “Heisenberg2.0”, in response to a series of questions from The Independent on Sunday. Among its selling points: next-day delivery, no hidden fees and an “eBay-style feedback system”.<br /><br /><br />“If we continue growing at the pace we are now we will be bigger than Silk Road this time next year, but we are playing the long game and know a lot will change in the world around us between now and then,” said Heisenberg2.0. “Maybe when the world’s leaders are ready to give up the prohibition game we will be ready to come out of the shadows and help clean up the mess they made. In the meantime we are quite happy to operate outside of the current legal frameworks that exist.”<br /><br /><br />The site is set up like a typical online marketplace offering forgeries, porn, memorabilia, sports shirts and a deal to “buy” Twitter followers for the online narcissist. Items banned from sale include “anything related to paedophilia, poisons, loans, investment opportunities, assassination services or anything which can inflict harm on another person”.<br />But its staple is drugs. Though the sums represent a tiny fraction of the multibillion-pound global market, the sites represent an emerging threat to law enforcement and an end to the reliance on street-corner deals. High-grade cocaine with purity claimed at more than 80 per cent is sold at £65 a gramme, and shipped from Belgium. Average street price in the UK is £46 a gramme, according to the charity DrugScope, but for inferior purity.<br /><br /><br />“If people can become aware of being able to source cocaine of that purity ... then we will see a change,” said Allen Morgan, an expert witness and former police officer. “There’s definitely a market for high-grade cocaine among professionals, and people are fed up of getting ripped off with low-quality cocaine. I think we will see a seismic shift in the UK drugs market and it will take the police a long time to get a grip on this.”<br /><br /><br />Atlantis is just the latest example of anonymous online markets – offering illegal merchandise or services – which are beginning to prosper and proliferate. Only The Armory – which sold weapons – was scrapped, because of low sales. Operators use the cloaking anonymity of the Tor network – known as the hidden web – created by the US military and designed to hide the identity of users and sellers.<br /><br /><br />Nicolas Christin, of Carnegie Mellon University, who has studied Silk Road, says the proof of its success is the emergence of competition. “You don’t have to interact with shady characters, you just click on a few buttons and you get what you want in the mail,” he said. “Silk Road was always under the radar. Atlantis is very aggressively marketing itself. It’s a very different approach.”<br /><br /><br />Deals on Atlantis are done via encrypted software and paid for with cybercurrency, an internet cash equivalent. Sellers are encouraged to “creatively disguise” shipments as business mail, and vacuum-pack them to avoid sniffer-dog detection.<br /><br /><br />The identity of those behind Atlantis is a mystery, and Heisenberg2.0 declined to reveal even the nationality of its founders. The Serious Organised Crime Agency said it was “aware of the so-called ‘hidden’ areas of the internet, and has the capability to investigate organised criminal groups seeking to exploit them”.<br /><br /><br />Police have successfully targeted sellers on such sites. In April 2012, US authorities busted a secret drugs marketplace known as the Farmer’s Market, resulting in eight arrests in the US, the Netherlands and Colombia. Officials said the ring handled over $1m (£655,000) in drugs sales from 2007 to 2009. It had customers in every US state, and in 34 countries, according to court documents.<br /><br /><br />Peter Wood, the founder of the ethical hacking firm First Base Technologies, said breaking open the networks depended on identifying individuals, then seizing their computer equipment. “It’s a case of tricking the person into engaging with them to get access to a computer,” he said. “It’s the same sort of techniques as traditional police work, and conning the conmen.”<br /><br /><br />Global crime goes online<br /><br />Organised gangs are increasingly switching from traditional crimes to cyber scams to tap lucrative new opportunities through the relative anonymity of the web, statistics showed this week – with a sharp rise in online crimes recorded in England and Wales.<br /><br /><br />The cracking of criminal rings involved in child sex abuse, fake credit cards and online drug sales have led to gangs going deeper into the so-called Darknet to avoid the law. The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre this month revealed its concern over the growing use of anonymous online encrypted networks, with use in Britain increasing by two-thirds, one of the largest increases globally.<br /><br /><br />Europol warns that new technologies adopted by criminals mean that previous investigative methods “will prove ineffective”.<br /><br /><br />Deputy Chief Constable Jeff Farrar, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: “Crime is moving to the online world.”<br /><br /><br />The advantages for criminals are clear: the web allows greater penetration of global markets without the risk of border security, and profit potential is huge through the activities of small numbers of criminals. The 27 per cent rise in frauds last year was accompanied by falls in most other crimes.<br /><br /><br />The benefits were highlighted by the tiny operation that ran a “Facebook for fraudsters” from an internet café but acted as a supermarket for a global network of cyber criminals that led to losses of tens of millions of pounds. A Sri Lankan-born Briton, Renukanth Subramaniam, was jailed for nearly five years for orchestrating the Darkmarket site, where&nbsp; 2,000 fraudsters traded credit cards and viruses. Prosecutors said that the scam utilised modern technology with “no more than a dishonest will, a laptop, a mouse and internet access” to commit theft on an unprecedented scale.<br /><br /><br />But Darkmarket is dwarfed by what US authorities claim is a £4bn money-laundering project by a firm that hid proceeds of crimes such as theft, drug trafficking and child porn. Liberty Reserve was the front for 55 million illegal transactions, according to an indictment lodged in the US courts after its founder was arrested in Spain in May.<br /><br /><br />The Serious Organised Crime Agency said it had sent “cyber liaison officers” to key locations abroad to work with other agencies.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />

				*yawn*<br /><br />nothing news worthy here really.... we all know Atlantis has been aggro marketing and SR&#039;s success is being copied. strange how the article doesnt mention BMR in any of this, which is vastly larger than Atlantis<br /><br />and come on now, turf war? really? gotta be sensationalized like that? by the article&#039;s own admission the global drug trade is a multi BILLION dollar industry, whereas the combined profits of SR, ATL, and BMR is &quot;only&quot; in the tens of millions.<br /><br />translation: there&#039;s plenty of room to prosper for everyone.<br /><br />just my 2 satoshi worth of opinion.<br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb

				I don&#039;t know that I can accept the 500 users a day due to their Youtube hosted video.&nbsp; I could stomach maybe 500 the first day, mostly from curious georges, but I can&#039;t see it getting 500 a day many times after that.<br /><br />I would be interested in knowing the average user accounts created each day, average no. of orders placed each day, average size of order, and maybe no. of users that logged in at least once a month plus I can think of a whole shitload of data points I would like to look at.&nbsp; This being for SR, Atlantis and BMR.&nbsp; It would be interesting to know true figures, not ones that are manipulated by some PR person looking to put their spin on it.

				I did reply to this article on the web site ....<br /><br />Firstly an interesting article if I am correct its the first article of its kind in the Irish media even though I have mentioned Silk Road in various interviews before. Certainly the development of such a site such as Atlantis was always anticipated however there are similar sites as well. Its an interesting development to see Atlantis using marketing such as Twitter and You Tube to entice vendors and sellers - it has to be highlighted that the You Tube video has been removed after a reported 100,000 views . Atlantis has offered financial deals to dealers however many of the buyers.<br /><br />In undertaking academic research on this site I have spoken to on SR buyers who are reluctant to buy from Atlantis for the fear of being scammed and also the fear that Law Enforcement could set up sting operations on sites as Atlantis Many of the buyers do not like the way the automatic encryption and the strict moderation on the forums.<br /><br />One SR buyer said &#039;Why choose a suspect site with questionable advertisements, trying to steal customers/vendors. For vendors its not attractive because there is no customer base. Here on SR u have what? 100.000 possible customers? There is just no reason to go elsewhere than SR&#039;<br /><br />In the article it states &quot;If we continue growing at the pace we are now we will be bigger than Silk Road this time next year&quot; I have to question this as there is significant loyalty to SR and SR is more than just a drug selling site it has a forum that is very active with intelligent and knowledgeable people on there. There are people even pharmacists and a GP on the forum who are actively providing information about reducing harm. People on SR would view it as a community rather than just a site that sells drugs.<br /><br />Sites such as Atlantis and Silk Road are going to become the norm for alot of people wanting to purchase drugs as according to buyers they know what they are getting when they buy from these sites as opposed to the street as there is a feed back system. I am sure its always going to be a cat and mouse game between sites like these and Law Enforcement.

				The Indy has always been a broadsheet that wanted to be a tabloid, so you need to take the sensationalism as a given unfortunately.<br /><br />I found two things notable in the article; the first being that Atlantis managed to get some more publicity out of this and the second that the article didn&#039;t mention bitcoins.<br /><br />What will be interesting to watch in future is what happens as a result of the NSA/Prism/GCHQ stuff.&nbsp; If &quot;normal&quot; people start using tor at an increased rate then I&#039;ll lay bets that you&#039;ll see more of this branding of tor users as criminals in an attempt to push them back to where they can be monitored.<br />

				You&#039;re lucky, the Irish Indy allowed comments where the UK one didn&#039;t.<br /><br />In the end, all the Atlantis references in the article are pure Atlantis marketing.&nbsp; They&#039;ve demonstrated that they are pretty shameless about it, as most people on the make are.&nbsp; Sadly SR can&#039;t easily go down that route because there are organised, non-LE, vested interests that act in concert against SR.&nbsp; The normal laws of inertia apply to SR as well as everywhere else so DPR should have a good idea what needs to be done to maintain his customer base.

				I wanted to expand my crypto savings into LTC so I opened up a sellers account over there. I have been surprised with how much business I am getting there, it&#039;s been comparable to my recent SR sales, and I&#039;m more surprised at how few LTC transactions I have, I though that was one of their big selling points... It&#039;s not bad, but there isn&#039;t a whole lot of listings compared to SR, it will grow in time, but SR buyers will probably stay on SR for the most part, now it&#039;s just a fight for the new people.

				This thread was started by an individual, who has interest&#039;s in Atlantis. It&#039;s all bullshit, Atlantis has something like a few thousand. There not in our league, and if they are telling the truth when they claim to have poached are top 5% vendors and staff from SR, then I understand people trying to broaden their horizons. What&#039;s not on is these DDoS attacks, because DPR said he welcomes your competition, as long as it&#039;s friendly. DDOS are far from friendly. Look at it like this, I think Dimitrie and whatever CEO of Atlantis, wont last long, they are&nbsp; driving a bright yellow Range Rover, with look at me stripes, while DPR favours the nondescript blend into the background ford. Who will last longer? Super low key DP, or bang on top Dimitire?

But I guess you answered yourself there, Come on what happened to the analytic thinker, is that all you can come up with? I&#039;m making stuff up?<br />&nbsp;Now I&#039;m done OK. If your not some clandestine mole who works/advertizes for the enemy, then pull the post down, and back up your claims of ignorance towards Atlantis.Leave it up, and your protestations will fall on deaf ears. upon further reflection, I was harsh accusing you of advertizing, and you were correct to question me. So lets just agree to disagree.

				Im not going to be going to any other site any time soon. I have had no issues with SR &#039;yet&#039; so I am happy to continue using a trusted site like SR over another newcomer. Everything I need is right here so I dont see the point in risking using another site.<br /><br />I also feel that there is more to SR than just scoring drugs...Like there is a bigger task at hand. The way Atlantis has conducted their marketing it seems to be about profit like &#039;Oh, this is the next big thing...Better get on it while its hot and make some money&#039;<br /><br />DPR has a bigger mission with SR and I am happy to partake...I aint going nowhere other than SR at this point. I havnt even looked at the Atlantis site as there is really no need. Im happy...
