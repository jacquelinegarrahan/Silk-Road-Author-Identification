				I don&#039;t &quot;hate&quot; it, but at the moment, I&#039;m not digging it much. The images have become a hinderance to viewing the listings. <br /><br />The &quot;look&quot; is nice, but the gigantic images need to be tweaked a bit, if not discarded all together. In most cases, images don&#039;t mean a whole lot. They have their purpose but they aren&#039;t important. They&#039;re just a nice bonus. Images shouldn&#039;t overshadow description and price. <br /><br />Having dozens of drug pictures on my monitor makes the browsing experience less comfortable. <br /><br />Keep the fresh look, but I could really do without the images!<br /><br />I also really miss the #&#039;s next to each category. That was a feature I relied on heavily.

				Good lord, why mess with a good thing? Do you sellers notice that you don&#039;t see your own seller rating anymore? When I pointed this out to DPR, and told him it&#039;s a change that really was not necessary, even superfluous, he agreed with me!<br /><br />And I second this thing about enormous images overshadowing the listings, and the sellers&#039; names are hardly visible, and why do the categories have no numbers (different listings) attached to them?<br /><br />Silly, unnecessaary changes!<br /><br />goblin

				Good effort on the new look, but really needs a tiny bugfix. Fast. Images are WAY too big. Almost comically so. The old table format was so much more informative and intuitive and just plain made sense, not to mention the fact that you could scroll over the listings in the blink of an eye, comparing prices, etc. Now it&#039;s like eBay, only worse. Hate to say it, but it&#039;s true. If i didn&#039;t absolutely abhor drugs, the giant icons alone would have had me running screaming for the hills. :)) No, really.. I feel like Silk Road is SHOUTING AT ME. And I hate shouty people. So..<br /><br />Please, please, pleeeease bring back the complete and utter lack of giant images and unnecessarily huge font and formatting in general. Other than that, great job on the renovation :)) Just needs to be toned down a tad. Although, it would be nice, as someone else mentioned earlier I think, if you could also bring back the total number of listings for each category and subcategory (in their parentheses, where they belong), that would be amazing.<br /><br />Is that too much to ask? :)<br /><br />konfustikate<br />&nbsp;:) :D :)) ;D

				Well there are some things that I like about it, and it is generally an improvement, but I wish you could turn the images off. Actually take a look at what comes up when you do a search for a product, a nice dense list of items without pictures. Add in item ID#&#039;s and it&#039;s exactly what I would want for the product listing when I click a catagory.

Zuckerbird probably wants to buy it hahaha. How many members does SR have now? Almost 28,000?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />According to a journalist, Eileen Ormsby of The Age (an Australian broadsheet newspaper, because the Aussie journalists have bigger balls than Americans or Brits these days), there&#039;s roughly 20,000 forum members, 100+ active at any moment, and there is a great deal many more people active on the actual SR site, 100,000 active buyers or so.<br /><br />Can that figure be accurate at all?<br /><br />IMHO, we can extrapolate from the number of forum users to ascertain how many SR users there are. This is because the vast majority of people online with any major website are not forum participants, but lurkers instead. As a rule of thumb, about 5% - 10% are &#039;community oriented&#039; enough to be participants and the rest lurk (hence a disproportionate amount of geeks here and on other internet forums, but this is always a very inaccurate impression of overall site participation, since geeks themselves are a tiny percentage of the overall population which is likely ~1%-3%). <br /><br />So, I believe that these figures are basically accurate, even accounting for certain biases such as the fact you need to know something about using computers before you manage to get here (but honestly, not that much, and it&#039;s literally ten seconds to show somebody else how to download Tor and find SR&#039;s url even if they are as dumb as a stump).<br /><br />See: assume 50% of the forum are geeks -&gt; 10k, then multiply by 10 because they only represent 10% of the &#039;real population&#039; = 100,000. This is actually a rather conservative estimate, due to the illegal nature of transactions on SR, it could put people off participating in the community so it could be much higher.<br /><br />So, that&#039;s the good news. The bad news is that the other 90% contain the majority of people who would benefit the most from joining my PGP Club and reading the forum in general to protect their security and improve transaction rates etc. The proverbial battle may not always be won by &#039;the swift&#039; and the &#039;the mighty&#039;, but it sure fucking is most of the time, so these types could lose out big time.<br /><br />Also: if Eileen Ormsby&#039;s source on transaction quantity and value is as accurate as the number of active participants on SR, then SR pulls down a minimum of half a million US dollars per week, which, you know, is rather respectable I think.

				The only thing I dislike about the new look is the removal of the (number) of listings next to each category on the menu.&nbsp; I would often log in and see &quot;Dissociatives(71)&quot; and if the next day it said &quot;Dissociatives(79)&quot;, I would browse that category, knowing that a few new listings had been posted.&nbsp; Not a huge deal, just means more time browsing SR for me!
