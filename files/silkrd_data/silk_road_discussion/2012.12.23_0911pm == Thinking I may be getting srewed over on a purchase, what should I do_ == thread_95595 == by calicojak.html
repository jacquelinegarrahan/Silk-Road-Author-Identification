				Well let me start off buy saying I have had 12 successful transactions since I&#039;ve been here a little more than a month. Never had any issues, everything bit of mail has gotten to me, and I could not ask for smoother transactions. So I place a domestic order on the 14th of December from a vendor with 100 feedback, thinking feedback matters. Well a couple days go by and still my order says processing. I get a message from the vendor telling me he is going through some really hard times right now but assured me he would send my order out on the 17th..17th comes and goes, still processing. By the way we have messaged eachother a few times over the weekend as I was offering words of encouragement to cheer him up, I&#039;m a caring soul by nature. Even though I don&#039;t know him and would never meet him I still felt for what he said he was going through. Ok so now its the 18th and I wake up and check the status and it says in transit. I get a message from him saying everything was all good and my pack shipped out, plus he upgraded my shipping to priority because of the waiting I have been doing. Ok now its the 21st and still nothing, which is odd for priority but its the holidays so I told myself. I message him asking about the status and he gets back to me saying he will check the tracking and let me know. Well today is the 23rd and I have never heard from him again, I have messaged him twice over the weekend but no luck. Also I noticed hes in stealth mode, but was not when I placed my order. So conveniently I can&#039;t see when he&#039;s been online. Maybe it will come tomorrow but I doubt it. What&#039;s my next step??? I still have 11 days left till auto finalize. When will I be able to click the resolve button?

But it smells like bullshit.... If it walks like a duck then..... I&#039;m still trying to give him the benefit of doubt, which is why I haven&#039;t posted his name. But come on guy, if a person tells you they are having serious financial problems but sets the profile to stealth when he was never in stealth before. Wouldnt you be trying to get as many sales as possible right now to get some cash flowing again instead of going into stealth where you are limiting yourself? I&#039;m sorry but my bs meter is going off.

				To top it all off I have received two domestic packages this week, one of them was sent priority the other regular mail. All three order were placed in transit the same day. I received the priority pack a day later and the reg mail pack 3 days later. So it must just be my luck that a reg mail pack beat a priority pack by two days so far lol....

				I have seen priority screw up. I sent a package to a nearby state and it took about 10 days when it should have been 2 days and it wasn&#039;t even xmas time. I&#039;ve sent a letter across town and had it go out of state and back again taking weeks. You don&#039;t earn a 100 rating by screwing people over. Maybe he just turned bad but more likely its not his fault. Wait until friday and then possibly make a dispute. Your package might come while the dispute is being reviewed. Have you asked for a tn yet? Wait until wednesday before you check it because that might be the day you get it. Happy holidays!

				Wait... I as a vendor can assure you that USPS does some weird as shit. I express mail &#039;over night&#039; a package from Midwest to Southwest and it took 2 1/2 weeks. I then mailed a priority order to the same address and they arrived on the same day after and that&#039;s after I received an email from USPS stating that the package was lost in transit. Wait til the option to resolve a transaction comes up and click it. Request 100% &amp; state your case. No response from vendor you win. Vendor responds back and provides tracking 50%. Even if that tracking looks like it wasn&#039;t for and say went to North Carolina and You live in Michigan I have found that SR Support will give 50% they don&#039;t seem to want to piss either side off.&nbsp;

				I think you should allow this vendor a little more time. If there is 11 days left that means its only been marked in transit for 6 days. Although that is a tad long I would allow a least another 3 days consideration for the holidays.&nbsp; I hope things work out for you bud! Hopefully this guy just forgot to put it in the mailbox for a day or 2 after he marked in transit.

				I feel your pain, and i can say on the buyers side i have witnessed the USPS do some very odd shit.&nbsp; I had a mailman put my package in an empty locked box because the office was closed where it was being delivered and he didn&#039;t want to take it back to the main office.&nbsp; He then went on vacation for 2 days after that.&nbsp; There was a weekend in between as well.&nbsp; In the meantime i kept my cool and the vendor lost their shit on me???&nbsp; They called the USPS and were told i didn&#039;t put an apartment number so they couldn&#039;t deliver.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never put an apartment number for that addy and never had a problem.&nbsp; Anyway, the usual postman comes back off vaca and hands it to me and tells me what he did.&nbsp; All is well then, but a week late and a good vendor for shit i like thinks I&#039;M shady as fuck.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bottom line is there is nothing you can do but wait on resolution.&nbsp; You could name and flame him, but regardless of the case that isn&#039;t going to do anyone any good.&nbsp; I mean if you really think your being scammed you should name him and flame him for the community&#039;s sake, but that doesn&#039;t sound like the case here.&nbsp; So there is nothing to do but wait for resolution, keep your cool (like you are), get goodies elsewhere in the meantime, and state your case when the time comes.&nbsp; So it turns out your decision is easy because you only have one choice of what to do.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well really one choice of action and that&#039;s wait for resolution.&nbsp; Two choices of how to wait.&nbsp; Like a gentleman or a jackass.&nbsp; You&#039;ve chosen gentleman so far so i&#039;d stick with that the rest of the way.&nbsp; Because your choice of how could effect future transactions with other vendors.&nbsp; You&#039;re good man.&nbsp; Keep it up!<br /><br />&amp; Merry Christmas<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve only been to resolution one time.&nbsp; Just keep all messages so you can send them or quote times and dates.&nbsp; Other than that be honest.&nbsp; I had a reputable vendor not send an order once.&nbsp; He screwed me and several others all at the same time so he was in resolution with all of us at nearly the same time.&nbsp; I was given 100% refund and it didn&#039;t even show up on my stats.&nbsp; I think because it was so obvious it was the vendor the mods didn&#039;t even ding my stats!&nbsp; So as in real life it seems to be the same here.&nbsp; Honesty is the best policy.&nbsp; Good Luck man &amp; hopefully is the mailman&#039;s delay and it shows up for you.

				You&#039;re in escrow and you still have 11 days to go. <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry for now. The worse that can happen is that you would need to go through resolution, but it isn&#039;t like you FE&#039;d which pretty much means you&#039;re screwed when things go awry.

				If you don&#039;t post his&nbsp; name how do you expect to get an answer from others that might be having the s as me issue with the same vendor? Does this said vendor have s review thread? That would be the first place I would inquire. See if anyone else is having any issues with him/her, ask if anyone else has been in contact with the vendor... Check the feedback on vendor page see if anyone else has received their packages lately. I hope everything works out for you.
