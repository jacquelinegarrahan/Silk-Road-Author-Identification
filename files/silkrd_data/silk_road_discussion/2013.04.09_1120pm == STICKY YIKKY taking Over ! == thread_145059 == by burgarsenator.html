				Yeah a link to your vendor page should be in your forum sig, and your SR profile should link back here as well.<br />Describe the product better, I&#039;ve never even heard of sticky yikky, tell us about it.&nbsp; Maybe throw some pics up.<br />Give this profile some love and the returns will make it worthwhile.

				Just a friendly bit of advice, you aren&#039;t doing yourself any favors with this thread. It&#039;ll make people suspicious of you, as it looks like you don&#039;t&#039; have your act together. Don&#039;t post until you have a vendor page, products and samples ready to go, etc. You should have everything set up before you start advertising.<br /><br />My first reaction upon seeing your multiple posts, the only one bumping this thread... you look like a scammer who can&#039;t even get his shit together and try to look legit. Hell, that&#039;s probably the case, and I&#039;m wasting my breath while your business model relies on the handful of suckers who WILL order from you

				Yeah, but curiosityMatrix has a point. It DOES look like a scam set up. Plus you&#039;re posting in the wrong section. Product offers would be best. But if you do this, there, you&#039;ll definitely will not be doing yourself any favors. <br /><br />If anything, ask if there&#039;s any interest and state that you will be coming to SR soon but want to see what sort of demand there might be for this product.
