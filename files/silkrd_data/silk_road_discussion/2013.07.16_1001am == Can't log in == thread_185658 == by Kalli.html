I&#039;m logged on to SR at the moment and the site is working fine for me so there&#039;s no need to worry.&nbsp; 8)

				Having the same problem. I was browsing SR and then it logged me out. when i tried to log back in I couldn&#039;t :( I really hope I didn&#039;t get hacked. But the fact that this is happening to other people makes me think that it&#039;s a problem on SR part.
