				Is it really necessary that every single member starts a topic about SR being down?<br />Yes, the website it&#039;s down at the moment, DPR and the team are working on the issue. SR will be up soon! Stop spamming the forum with the same questions.

People are moaning at you because there are several threads on this and they think perhaps you should have read them first, including one at the top of the page saying &quot;update&quot;.<br /><br />So yeah, have a look around and read before you go crazy and post without thinking :)
