				I know there are few rules on SR governing buyers and sellers. So what are the rules regarding changing ratings in exchange for money or cash back? Are there any at all? If not, then some vendors&#039; feedback ratings do not truthfully reflect their transaction history. And vendors with some really bad ratings can be made to look squeaky clean when in reality they&#039;re anything but.<br /><br />Thanks guys. FYI I&#039;m a buyer not a seller.

				Goddamnit. I meant BUYERS not sellers in the title of this thread.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Can a mod change the title so that &quot;sellers&quot; is replaced by &quot;buyers&quot;? I don&#039;t see any options that would allow me to do that.

Although that&#039;s the flipside of the coin. I&#039;m talking about a buyer having a legitimately bad experience and posting appropriate feedback about it, then being asked by the vendor to change the feedback to a 5/5 and erase the negative comments.

				Giving an unhappy customer money to make them happy is not bribary, it is refunds and reperations. If buyers end up happy at the end then why shouldn&#039;t the stats reflect that?<br /><br />In cases where I made an error and got a low feedback I have contacted that buyer to negotiate a refund plus some free tabs. I do it because I want better feedback, and I do it because I fucked up and I want the customer to be happy and return.<br /><br />Bribery exists when exchanges of money are taboo. In a business deal it is no bribery to intice the other side with a better offer.<br />

				If we made a bad mistake we would always give compensation to our customers.<br /><br />If we done our job and a customer was unreasonable and complaining when there is nothing wrong they would get a big fat penis in their batty and told to be on their way. <br /><br />Luckily we do not have to deal with people like this very often :)

				I&#039;ve had the opposite of this happen. I&#039;m a vendor and I had a buyer try to blackmail me with negative feedback if I didn&#039;t send him more shit. It really pissed me off. I honestly don&#039;t mess with anything sub-par. I&#039;m not a habitual drug user, but I test literally everything I stock for safety and quality control. I honestly care about my customer base, too many people DON&#039;T care. I always message buyers with tips, limits, do&#039;s, and do nots. Anyways, I got it worked out and he fucked right off thank god. I&#039;d rather take an asshole giving me an undeserved bad rating than bend to some dick trying to blackmail me. Needless to say, that dude is cut right off!<br /><br />As for the topic, I think it should be ok. Say you genuinely fuck up and want to make it right, you should be able to reimburse the buyer with cash or drugs to make the sale on par with what you intended. If you make it right, then you deserve that 5, you know? That&#039;s what it&#039;s about, dishing out what you claim and sticking to your word. Honesty, honor, and respect above all.
