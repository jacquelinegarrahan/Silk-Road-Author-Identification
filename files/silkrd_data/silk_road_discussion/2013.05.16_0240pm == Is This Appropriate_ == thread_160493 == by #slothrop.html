				I&#039;m planning on reporting the vendor Pillsfast AKA Dr Pill. I ordered some dex from him, and because it was the beginning of finals week and I&#039;d put off procuring anything until the last minute, I was forced to pay for overnight shipping. It&#039;s expensive, but I&#039;m desperate and a good grade is worth more than $30. As of now, my order has been sitting in processing for three days, well after the guaranteed 48 hour arrival time. I would normally be okay with just going to resolution, however this happened to me ordering from Dr Pill. This person claims to have ironed out their shipping problems, but I see no evidence of that. <br />If I do report, what happens? I assume it&#039;s similar to the resolution process?

				Technically, he has 4 days to process your order. SR allots him that. However, if he agreed via PM to get your order out immediately, SR staff can view those PM&#039;s to support your case.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t know the answer to your question, but I hope that info helps.

				It couldn&#039;t hurt to contact support or a mod on the forums.<br /><br />You did everything right on your end however i had a similar situation where i needed something to come within a week i had enough BTC and ordered from 2 different vendors the same day and thankfully so, because one never arrived but im glad i ordered a duplicate. <br /><br />good luck

				No one can do anything for you except the vendor. That&#039;s the only person. Reporting it does nothing at all. No one can compel or give him an incentive to move faster. <br /><br />Life in the black markets.

You can consider taking it to resolution and requesting a % refund (to the value of the Express shipping) to compensate you for it, and I would think you would get it, but you would also increase the refund rate on your purchasing stats.<br /><br />The % amount that shows up on your stats may surprise you if this does happen, so please see the SR Wiki entry about stats here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_are_my_stats_incorrect.3F<br /><br />Libertas

				Never have any expectations when you order something off of SR, other than that the vendor will send it and you will receive it within a 10 day period (if domestic) or a 20 day period (if international). That&#039;s it. All these stories about, &quot;I wanted it by this date and didn&#039;t receive it!&quot; are bullshit. Don&#039;t give yourself a 1 or 2 day grace period give yourself a week minimum before you need it.
