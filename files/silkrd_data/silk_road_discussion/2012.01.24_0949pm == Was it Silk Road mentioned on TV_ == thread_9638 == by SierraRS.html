				I watched Drugs.Inc.S02E05.Ketamine.HDTV.XviD-NMBSTV and in about 18:40 there is that guy buying and reselling the ketamine. It is interesting that there is mentioned unnamed website, but I could not say it is SR or some other site. Don&#039;t know if the dealers there are real or not, but they censored Dell logos from his notebook :D

				It&#039;s obviously not sr, but that guy&#039;s security is so shitty that I doubt he&#039;s part of the private forum scene... &quot;I suppose I should concoct a better story...&quot; really? ::)

				Heh, yeah that guy getting 1KG of Ketamine direct from India paid for via PayPal cracked me up. The most interesting thing to me about that episode was that the US is *not* the strictest country when it comes to K. And I almost thought about trying it until they showed the addict with the messed up bladder... :X

				The realization that he would actually feign as somebody stealing mail from a foreclosed home is what did it for me.

The problem is in repeated usage, and not only with ket, but some other antibiotic can also cause degradation of urinary tract tissue and subsequent infection. The addict are fucked up badly, don&#039;t know why he need so much drugs in his life, but he must seek help.

				No he said he paid with pay pal.....I imagine there is many other sites and internet hook ups out there...But the guy who bought the K either doesnt use the road or concealed his use of the road by saying misleading information about his hook up in india..Either is possible but I dont think he did. I saw and thought that same thing.....<br /><br />

				SR was mentioned in Dutch TV programmes as well as YouTube. Surprisingly, there&#039;s a vendor here who had an online interview in that TV programme. No good.<br /><br />Fuck, I hope they don&#039;t publicize SR. Please.
