				Just got a new job and I can&#039;t think of any better way to spend my first paycheck then ordering a smorgasbord of interesting new substances to try. I&#039;ve already got DMT, LSD, 25i-nBOMe, and a whole lot of grand daddy purp. I&#039;m really interesting in psychedelics and recently dissociatives have piqued my interest as well. I&#039;m looking to spend about 300 bucks and I&#039;d like to try as many new substances as possible. So far I&#039;m thinking 150mg of MXE, 200mg of Ketamine 18mg of 2c-e, Maybe a couple blotters of DOC. I hate to say it but I&#039;m also sort of interesting in trying cocaine so if anyone wants to try to talk me out of it or give me any other suggestions I&#039;d really appreciate it.

				Your list looks to be good, covering all of the fundamentals. I&#039;d grab a gram or even more of Ketamine and share it with my buddies if I hadn&#039;t tried it before; 200 mg of K is just not going to work out for anyone (too small of a dose!) There&#039;s numerous vendors on here who are fairly priced at around 30-40 USD for a gram. Take the plunge and report back to us :)<br /><br />MXE on the other hand is quite potent and even that small dose will suffice quite nicely to sample.<br /><br />If you want something that has a fairly brief duration (3~ hrs) that is experientially somewhere in the gradient between mushrooms and DMT, try 4-AcO-DMT. I find a lot of people who respond really positively to this one.<br /><br />As for 2c-e, it&#039;s definitely one of the most unique and uniquely weird substances I&#039;ve ever done (if dosed high enough). 18 mg is good for one trip (are people really selling in such small increments?) but I&#039;d go for at least 100mg and share the experience with friends.<br /><br />Hope this has helped, good luck.<br /><br />Edit: I wouldn&#039;t really recommend any of the DOx&#039;s, the trips ring hollow for me and are usually too long and arduous to be worth the time or money. Go for a few more tabs of LSD, you aren&#039;t missing anything.

Also bums me out that all the singe gram MXE listing went down :(

				bcpltd is a good option for coke if you&#039;re not looking to buy more than a little bit to try. His listings are for as many units of 100mg as you want.<br /><br />Best coke on SR that I&#039;ve tried (out of Nod, MarloStanfield, bcpltd, and UndergroundSyndicate) is SpaceWrangler&#039;s, but his isn&#039;t cheap. $150/g, $98 for .5g. For me, it&#039;s worth it, since I hate coke with active cuts in it that make you wired after the coke itself has worn off. That&#039;s what you sometimes get with some of the less expensive options. I&#039;ve just ordered an 8ball from KingofTheTrill for a great price ($275); have heard nothing but good things about it but not sure if you&#039;re looking to spend that much.<br /><br />Lots of options on the road for domestic coke. Sadly, the prices are way high compared to street stuff, but since I&#039;ve never managed to find any decent stuff on the streets where I&#039;m from, it&#039;s the only option I have, and I pay a premium for that which I think is fair.<br /><br />Good luck with your adventures :)
