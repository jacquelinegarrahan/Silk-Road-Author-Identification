				Don&#039;t see how anybody could be under heat for selling a legal research chems when people are clearly selling heroin coke and meth on here... not worth the chances of a conviction.Not implying hes scamming either, maybe just bogged down with orders.

				there are a couple of other threads around here with info on the situation. and yes, selling legal chems for human consumption is no different really than selling illegal drugs. I had a couple &#039;legal&#039; shipments seized and am in the process of playing catch-up. Not able to reply to everyone the way I would like but I want to make sure you guys know i am still around and am not going to vanish. I sent a bunch of orders out over the weekend and am giving them a chance to arrive to the recipients before I say much more on the subject.. actions speak louder than words. sorry for the delay friend, your item probably has not shipped or did not ship until this weekend. either way, you will receive what you paid for. As for my account, it is suspended until further notice pending the over-due orders I have.

				glad you&#039;re still around and making good on promises.&nbsp; didn&#039;t want to think the worst but it&#039;s easy to see how LEO could claim you were selling blotters al biet, &quot;legal&quot; chemicals, as LSD.<br /><br />as one example, someone once got fucked at swanee music fest for selling a single 2c-i capsule to an undercover who claimed it was sold to him as MDMA.<br /><br />also some popular RC sites have been taken down, even ones with strict policies about human consumption. CRC redirects to dhs.gov now.... that&#039;s a canadian vendor getting dickslapped by good ol&#039; us of a<br /><br />don&#039;t assume you&#039;re safe because they are grey area.

				Guys DudeRugs is over at the Black Market Reloaded selling his same wares and just registered his account. He&#039;s already fucked 6 people by the looks of things! I ordered 300 on the 6th and have received no message replies and no drugs which in anyone&#039;s language means he&#039;s fucked me and plenty of others If he couldn&#039;t fill the order he shouldn&#039;t have marked them sent and offered our money back with sincere apologies. Instead all we&#039;ve seen i a few ten strips going out probably ones he&#039;d made up to try and get his account up again to scam more people! <br /><br />FUCK YOU DUDERUGS YOU SCUMBAG SHOW YOURSELF AND REFUND OUR MONEY YOU HAVE $300 OF MINE FROM THE 6TH I WANT BACK YOU THIEF!<br /><br />here&#039;s his BMR profile he recently made -&nbsp; http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php?p=viewUser&amp;id=48021

				Now I&#039;m really starting to get frustrated. I ordered on the 12th of june, and was hoping for my tabs to be here by now, even with shipping delays, two weeks is a pretty long time, even with shipping issues. I&#039;m probably just going to buy some from another vendor, this is getting ridiculous.

So always take that into consideration: be careful, dont use more money than you&#039;re willing to lose and make situations like this as a learning experience. I do not FE because my stats speak for themselves: if the vendor doesnt want my money then I&#039;ll give it to someone else..
