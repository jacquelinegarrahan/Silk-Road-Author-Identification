				Does anyone else wish there was a book with everything you needed to know about drug production, history, use etc.? Because I certainly do. I&#039;m curious: would anyone else want to make this a reality? <br /><br />It could be split into chapters, each chapter into sections, and each section into subsections. So something like: <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Marijuana<br /><br /><br />growing <br />supplies&nbsp; &nbsp; FAQ&nbsp; &nbsp; Things to Watch out For&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set-up&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Middle&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Harvest<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;use <br />smoking&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; edibles&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; effects&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;etiquette<br /><br /><br /><br />Logistics<br />annual expenses&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; history (past and present use)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; different types of Marijuana<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />It could go on to explain all drugs in that manner, which I think would be the best aspect of the idea. You could look up anything about any drug you&#039;d like all in one book, which would be amazingly convenient.<br /><br />Not to mention this is probably the place to have it done, if it&#039;s ever to be done. We&#039;ve got a community of people who are completely (more or less) anonymous and who know they&#039;re shit when it comes to drugs.

Drugs, Inc on Nat. Geo. gives you a rough breakdown for the most popular drugs, though.

				ALOT of lab created chems we all know and love are created from precurssers you would never think of, parsly oil and almond oil can both be synthed to produce psycoactives :) <br /><br />you could easily put together your own research book on synthesis! i doubt very much there is one out there, the legal concerns are to great..<br /><br />anyone know where i would find a copy of &quot;Total Synthesis&quot; by strike? that would be really awesome to have..

				There are tons of compendiums of this sort of thing. One of them = Erowid, another you are looking at :)<br /><br />I find that something like a book is not trustworthy. When you&#039;re talking about people + recreational drug use, everybody&#039;s brain chemistry is SO different that giving one list of what&#039;s what is an exercise in futility. I like Erowid as a source for the same reason I like these forums - lots of experience reports from different people. <br /><br />Just simply consulting one source is a terrible idea. For instance, when I take Adderall, it actually slows me down... It is prescribed for ADD because it essentially &#039;speeds up&#039; the part of the brain that slows you down, to put it in stupidly reductionist terms. So if I didn&#039;t know any different and you asked me what Adderall does, I&#039;d tell you &#039;it calms you down.&#039; <br /><br />That = EXACT opposite of what most people experience. YMMV, yes, but you may also go backwards;)<br /><br /><br />About the manufacture of drugs... There are plenty of documents floating around that do exactly what you just described. The reason they aren&#039;t widely available, though, isn&#039;t because of any anti-drug propaganda. It&#039;s mostly because inexperienced chemists will blow themselves up if you give them that kind of information. What looks like it would be just a simple recipe if you had the ingredients and equipment is very much not. That&#039;s the reason meth has been so demonized - ever see the Minnesota Meth Project commercials/ads? Or Faces of Meth? Or any number of other shit designed to shock the piss out of you so you see meth as inherently evil? <br /><br />Sure part of that is because meth isn&#039;t exactly good for you, but the biggest reason is that you can make it right now with chemicals you can just go buy, and they are chemicals that it&#039;s not really practical to outlaw completely (that&#039;s why Sudafed is behind the counter in the US now and there&#039;s a federal database tracking how much you buy, vs. outright banning it - fact is Sudafed is a very effective medicine). I checked it out once on my lunch break at work - I found all the chemicals required at local stores within 45 minutes. Simple. <br /><br />But if I tried to make meth what I&#039;d get would be meth, but it would also be fucking poison. Because that&#039;s what it&#039;s made of.&nbsp; And that&#039;s if I didn&#039;t suffocate myself with the gas that is produced (phosphene?). <br /><br />Even seemingly easy shit can get you killed - that&#039;s how Richard Pryor blew himself up. Because he was trying to make crack using ether and ether is a ridiculously dangerous chemical. <br /><br />So yeah.... I ...... honestly don&#039;t think it&#039;s a very good idea to make that information so super-accessible. As it is now you can get it if you actively seek it out; you probably will. But if it were on a Wiki that was like linked on the SR home page, people would come across it just in idle curiosity, they&#039;d see it, they&#039;d think &quot;Hey I can do that&quot; and then everyone int the whole world will blow themselves up SR will be banned they will arrest every one of us and we will certainly all be raped. <br /><br />Point is, you shouldn&#039;t be able to get that sort of dangerous information by accident. I have the Silk Road wiki open in another tab for absolutely no reason. As soon as I&#039;m done writing this I&#039;m going to close both tabs. You shouldn&#039;t be able to be so flippant about it if it can (and absolutely will) blow someone up, yknow? And if you were going to try to find a group of people who would overestimate their intelligence and try to follow a recipe for making meth or something, this is that group of people. <br /><br />It&#039;s all out there, you just gotta dig for it. I think it&#039;s best that way. Not just for other people but for me as well... I happen to know I fucking suck at chemistry and I&#039;m 90% sure if I tried to make meth I would die somehow, but there are plenty of other things I&#039;ve seen on the internet that I&#039;ve tried and fucked myself up:) <br /><br /><br /><br />As a side note, no matter what anybody tells you, don&#039;t cook with 190-proof Everclear! :P
