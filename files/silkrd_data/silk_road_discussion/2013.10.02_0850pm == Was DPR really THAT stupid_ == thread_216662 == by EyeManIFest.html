				i mean.. come on.&nbsp; &nbsp;the way he got caught was sooooo&nbsp; pieced together.&nbsp; It almost sounds like they scripted his downfall.&nbsp; Maybe through nsa intercepts?&nbsp; then built a bullshit back history on how dpr was discovered.&nbsp; many of us know that guy is not the original dpr.

				This is a good point. If the Govt has the tech to track all tor users and wanted characters, but such privacy violations are not legal, then you can bet your ass they are going to come up with a legit back story to distract people and not raise suspicions so they can keep doing what they&#039;re doing. After all, the smartest move any combatants can make is to make their enemies feel like they are one step ahead when really it&#039;s the other way around.

				Mis information will be everywhere about this. But does sound like maybe he make very stupid mistakes. Being in USA believe was #1 mistake. When FED come to door asking about fake ID&#039;s, was good warning to close shop and leave. fast.

				Save your conspiracy theories for another time, there have been no reports ever of a hidden service being taken down simply for being a hidden service. FH was taken down because OP was doing sketchy money transfers through another country and got investigated, DPR got careless and left too much info out there. Vendors got busted cause their contacts/gf&#039;s ratted them. Theres always a non-tor related reason why this shit happens. If there was a technical way to bust hidden services all the other drug sites would be taken down.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t get why them including SR logo on takedown notice is significant in any way? Can the FBI not throw together a personalized takedown notice in between high giving each other.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its kind of strange, although probably coincidence that kmfkewn disappeared 2 days before this.

				Nope, no fucking way. I see 2 possibilities;<br />1. Feds busted him through NSA or something similar, the hitman story is just a pure joke... I mean come on $150k for a hitman?! When you know as much as him about deepweb you wouldn&#039;t spend nearly that much. This is the most likely possibility, fits perfectly since Washington just recently recognized BTC as a real currency and the goverment is shut down right now so they can do some stuff in the dark that nobody will ever know about.<br />2. DPR saw it fit to shut the site down and take the e$$crow, put the blame on FBI. FBI would not deny this because even if they didn&#039;t actually do this it would make people more scared of using onion.

				^There are public indictments and arrest affidavits circulating the internet a la reputable media giants like reuters. They most likely come from official sources. It&#039;s doubtful that they were slipped to reporters by DPR or his accomplices.

Might&#039;ve been worth it to spend the extra money on someone you know can complete the job.<br /><br />And for the 2nd option, I feel like why would he need to do that? Why throw away a steady income when you have so many millions of dollars that you won&#039;t even be able to launder for many hours.
