				So the vendor &#039;SlangNRox&#039; has been allowed to continue scamming people for a few weeks now, his rating has reached (45), he&#039;s openly bragging about how many people he&#039;s scammed (as I&#039;m sure he will in this thread) and added charming listings like &quot;ABSOLUTELY NOTHING - NOT A THING&quot;, &quot;SlangNRox&#039;s POO - STILL WARM - FRESH OUT&quot; and &quot;SlangNRox&#039;s AUTOGRAPH&quot; for the bargain price of $5k. <br /><br />I don&#039;t feel like I really have to justify the title of this thread much more than the above example, if we&#039;re going to let scammers run rampant can we at least scrape together a bit of the bitcoin from the taxes paid on the scam transaction for a small refund to the victims? I honestly feel like Silk Road has been failing to stand up to it&#039;s part of the bargain so far as doing everything possible to stop scammers. This could have easily been avoided (to some extent) by implementing something as small as putting a freeze on vendor accounts until reviewed when they reach a rating of 50-60. The above example has been happening on almost a weekly basis in the Australian scene alone, and despite numerous reports we are yet to see any action weeks later.

But (it&#039;s been estimated) 90% of SR users don&#039;t use the forums, and more and more people join our ranks everyday. As well as the fact most new buyers will be forced to FE at least a few times to get their stats up, I&#039;d rather they actually receive the drugs they pay for and an honest vendor get paid instead.

				Thought I would put my 2 cents in as a vendor - buyers scam too. I had 8 of them last week all with good stats. Cost me a ton of money as they held my feedback hostage demanding more product, refunds, begging, extorting, etc. Why - because they know they can. Because vendors have no &quot;resolve&#039; button and no way to leave feedback. All we vendors see is stats. The ENTIRE system needs an overhaul.

				Another prospective to consider:<br /><br />- too many buyers hit the report feature for the smallest of things. So SR staff gets overwhelmed. TOR is slow people. Imagine having to read hundreds of reports with most of them being meaningless or false gripes?<br /><br />- If you FE and get burnt... too bad. Harsh I know. The only way to stop FE is to implement a new system where orders under maybe $150 cannot be FE&#039;d and require buyer to mark received. This way new buyers just testing the market out don&#039;t have to be turned off because they got burnt. But then again, who would hand money to a dealer first expecting him to bring back drugs a few hours later? SO if you come on the scene with an eBay or Amazon attitude instead of a street smart one, you&#039;re going to get burned and there&#039;s no one to blame (or cry to) but yourself. <br /><br />- There&#039;s lots of ways to get scammed. But at least in escrow you won&#039;t get scammed for 100%. <br /><br />- A seller with a rating below 50%... if you get scammed by this seller, you had it coming if at the time you bought and FE&#039;d the rating was below 50%.

				This thread shows why scamming will never end on SR. People on this thread cannot even agree that scamming is wrong, and are instead blaming the victims. Yes, some of them were foolish, and quite a few of them are only foolish because they have faith that SR admins will crack down on obvious scams in a timely manner (which they do not do).

				Yep agree 100%... bunk product sellers need looking at as well as the FE scammers, why buyers are scared to call bad product is beyond me.<br /><br />In real life I have seen knee caps get broken when people have been sold bad or fake products, not that I want&nbsp; S R mods to be given base ball bats but<br />they control the money flow through the S R and that being cut off from bunk vendors while it gets sorted out hurts them more. If five or more buyers call out a vendor selling bunk gear, freeze the vendor account until the vendor produces verifiable proof of product quality via a lab analysis. No proof money goes back to buyers. :)

				I lost at least £400 GBP on SR it really ain&#039;t on and it&#039;s not just the blatant one&#039;s advertising warm shit it&#039;s the vendors who have soo many of their things seized then any new customers get selectively scammed this needs to stop too I am 1000 fold % sure that if SR was to tighten up on bastarding scammers it&#039;ll do a world of good and because they ain&#039;t doing anything about it it&#039;s actually spilling over onto SR itself and their getting scammed too you reap what you sow even the drugs if there was a system ie all vendors drugs get tested before sold on the road people wouldn&#039;t be getting sick or a disabilatating disease hitting them years down the line unbeknown to them it was from the mdma from bla bla bla on the silk road some 2 years ago causing it I&#039;m 1000% sure that this place could be a pleasure to use but at the min it really is a scammers paradise ie open an account sell shit and scam away with impunity against all I&#039;m thinking of opening an account too soon on SR well when I get a mortgage I will that&#039;s a few years from now though so let&#039;s sum this up SR =&nbsp; scammers paradise OR not plus I hate idiots who get sent shit and don&#039;t say shit and leave 5/5 even though they got shit man if their happy just actually receiving the goods they should start posting themselves presents through the post to them selves fucking idiots cos this good feedback stats is what fools many into being scammed rigorously I&#039;m done hope people understand and do something now about this as you&#039;ll have my support 1000 fold ok cheers all peace out.

				Maybe an added security where buyers that meet certain requirements can vote on vendors and after a certain amount of blackball votes they are banned or suspended or charged...&nbsp; Meh, well some version of that.&nbsp; it certainly isn&#039;t pristine but just an idea!&nbsp; Also, this would probably only apply to FE orders as there is no reason to with escrow...&nbsp; Come to think of it, I don&#039;t even know how to FE? Is it just that you finalize as soon as it is marked in transit or is there a button for finalizing when you order?

				Something needs to change, that&#039;s obvious.<br /><br />These FE scams are becoming way too frequent. The scary thing is, they use their scam profits to open a new account to repeat the process.<br /><br />It&#039;s apparent that 90% of SR buyers have no idea what the fuck they are doing. They don&#039;t use the forums and I really doubt they use common sense.<br /><br />Maybe the use of FE by vendors should be restricted even more so? It sucks that we may have to accommodate for the mentally challenged but I can&#039;t see how else this can be prevented. They need to be educated or protected.<br /><br />At the same time, I don&#039;t FE and I don&#039;t get scammed so it honestly doesn&#039;t affect me in the slightest. I just greatly dislike seeing people scam, steal and profit off the stupidity of others.<br /><br />-AussiePP

				Some great ideas being thrown around, I&#039;m glad most of us are happy to start a dialogue about this but to those just saying &quot;Don&#039;t FE, not my problem&quot;... We were all noobies once as well, and there&#039;s very few of you that have been around more than a year and not been scammed or mislead in some way. This isn&#039;t just about people scamming for nothing at all, but for cut or dangerous substances wrongly advertized.<br /><br />For instance, through my effort with the MDMA Avengers and testing various vendors products (many of which claim absolute purity of their product or impossibly higher) we have found that some vendors claim their drugs are almost double their stated purity.<br /><br />So ask yourself not just if you want tighter security to avoid losing the actual few dollars, but if it&#039;s worth it for that vendor that might sell you or a loved one cut drugs that could kill, hurt or interact very badly with other drugs they&#039;re taking at the time. This could also be a big problem for allergic reactions you&#039;re not aware to, regardless of how much damage things like PMA and TMFFF do to your body on their own, have you or anyone else ever taken an allergy test to these chemicals or any other possible cuts to the drugs you take? I highly doubt it, and as unlikely as it is.. It&#039;s a lot less likely when you&#039;re taking a pure substance and aware of the effects\reactions of that chemical. <br /><br />Another interesting idea to consider is how Atlantis uses their feedback system, I won&#039;t go into detail but definitely worth checking out.

				It&#039;s hard to distinguish a scammer when he spams 5/5 feedback from fake accounts. Closes their account and waits for a few months to get back to 100% to scam again. <br />Some ideas are not allowing 0BTC stealth listings, feedback from new buyers marked with a * or maybe just banning any vendor that asks for FE and much quicker response to scam reports.

It sucks if that did happen but it&#039;d save ALOT more times when $1000&#039;s walks out the door to a scammer, sometimes while they sit and gloat about it on the forum.<br /><br />Shits me, even if I haven&#039;t been a victim.

				All newbs should be required to go through a crash course on how to use SR before they can buy anything. Maybe they should make the buyers guide more visible when you first log in.

				Hi all.<br /><br />I do agree and tag along. Hopefully no one posted that before, as I merely stuck with the title. I will prolly post some considerations eventually. Just real quick. <br />An exert from the sellers guide:<br />&nbsp;<br />Things to avoid<br /><br />Below is a short list of specific things you should avoid. It is by no means exhaustive, but taking any one of these actions could get your seller priviledges revoked:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Directing your customers to pay outside the escrow system or in currencies other than Bitcoin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving fake feedback for yourself from a dummy buyer account<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Saving customer addresses<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Claiming to have sent an order when you haven&#039;t&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And you need to accurately describe your listing. <br /><br />These behaviors COULD be show stoppers, at the discretion of the (very few) ones reviewing the case, in order to find absolute solid evidence that is never disclosed against the ones there feeding off. There are other things, too. But they&#039;re not disclosed, neither.<br /><br />Extortion, death/violence threats, feedback leverage, blackmailing don&#039;t seem to be included in that list. Having threads with the same horror stories all over the forums neither. You can sell shit if you list it decent or good (applies to any product).<br /><br />And don&#039;t go and call that &quot;rules&quot;, but rather &quot;Things to avoid&quot;, there are no rules among the libertotalitarians.<br /><br />Peace out.<br />

				Mmm. I wasn&#039;t expecting a lot of love, but expected a least a heated debate. Or some &quot;stfu&quot;. Well...<br /><br />I got to read a lot about scams lately and got to that conclusion that escrow is not a protection from scammers. <br />I read some more and did &#039;t find any thread on what is a scam. <br /><br />-The seller guide is of no help in that regard. It doesn&#039;t define what is allowed and what is considered a scam. The decision of banning or suspending vendors isn&#039;t based on any objective criterion. There is no explanation on why and based on what a vendor will be looked upon and audited. Nor what is scanned and considered during that audit. Not what is sufficient to take actions. <br />- The report button is a gimmick. I never witness any vendor I reported get banned. <br />- Top vendors know how to play the system and even the most obvious and repeated scamming goes without action. Even if it&#039;s well known, often reported, a potential health issue and includes threats and extortion. And it happens within escrow. <br /><br />Some hate or comments?<br /><br />Peace out

				Never FE.&nbsp; Stick to the SR rule of thumb and all should be well.&nbsp; This is how the wind flows on the road.&nbsp; In my opinion, you should establish excellent communication with any vendor you plan on procuring from.&nbsp; Usually this tactic will lead you to choose wisely whom your about to buy from, if you trust your gut instinct.&nbsp; Most vendors care about their prospects and want you to feel comfortable with them in order to secure business with you.&nbsp; Just like on the streets, the same rule apply on the road.&nbsp; ;p&nbsp; happy unicorn hunting ;p
