				Hey there roaders! I wanted to write this out because I got ripped off by FEing on a lotto I won, and because I FE&#039;ed, couldn&#039;t do anything about it (i.e. take it to the resolution center.), not even leave less than a 5/5 (besides removing my rating).<br /><br />There are various postings for lottos where you spend a small amount (usually $1-10) for a chance to win items/money if your ticket ends in a certain number or letter. When a vendor asks you to FE and leave a 5/5 no matter the outcome, watch out! This means that if the vendor decides they don&#039;t want to ship your item, or it gets &#039;lost in the mail,&#039; they have no obligation to send you your stuff, and you can&#039;t give them less than a 5/5 because of it. You can, of course, leave them a bad review and remove you rating, but they will still keep your ticket price and you can&#039;t take it to resolution.<br /><br />It also makes no sense, if the vendor is honest, to FE if your lotto ticket is a winner, before you get your items. It&#039;s not like they need you to release $1-10 for shipping, and it&#039;s not like they are shipping out expensive items that they won&#039;t be able to re-up other products because they are waiting for a huge amount of money stuck in escrow. If they can&#039;t afford to send out the items in their lottos (which I believe was what happened in my case), they should not have lotto listings up. If you think about it, you shouldn&#039;t even have to FE for a losing lotto ticket, the vendor is losing literally nothing (besides a delayed couple of bucks and a delayed 5/5), while if the buyer lets the ticket auto-finalize, that negatively effects the buyers purchasing stats for life.<br /><br />So what I&#039;m saying is, go head and play lottos if you want to, but be weary if the vendor asks you to FE on a winner. You may end up getting ripped off like I did.

				While never FEing is a good policy, why wouldn&#039;t one just hold off until after the vendor has payed out before rating/reviewing the transaction?

				Who was the vendor? I see a lot of lottery&#039;s pop up and soon disappear so maybe stick to the bestselling ;)<br /><br />At the very least you should tell of your experience on their discussion page. <br />It COULD also have been a genuine mistake which I&#039;ve made one or two of in the past but always paid back double the difference when somebody gets in touch about a potential mistake.<br />Did you discuss this with the vendor or let them know if the issue?

No if, ands, or buts. Just leave a review/rating later if you won. <br /><br />But really, it&#039;s only a few bucks for product worth much more. Not something to make a big deal over. Just contact the vendor and &quot;remind&quot; the vendor of their obligation to ship what was promised. If you were able to take it to resolutions, what do you think would be the outcome? You&#039;d get your money back and get a ding on your stats for the privilege. And you might get blacklisted for being &quot;that guy.&quot; <br /><br />We ran a lotto once, had 5 winners and sent out prizes promptly. There was 1 auto-finalize from someone who lost. They ended up with a ding on their stats.
