				I&#039;ve been thinking about this because I&#039;m getting ready to place my first order. With the site being down for so many days you would think that once its back online there will be way more than the usual orders. Shipping times may slow even more :-\<br />Hopefully vendors don&#039;t get overwhelmed and resort to selective scamming or worse

				depends on the drug - depends on the dealer<br /><br />of course legitimate dlrs will be swamped and slower to ship <br /><br />if it&#039;s your first order u can wait a week - u don&#039;t need it so bad

				ya know one thing i notice a lot on this forum is people who have very little trust, and a whole lot of worry. My main guy on SR i totally trust, he is always right on, and super generous with extras. I always leave feedback as soon as i can before i get the product because i know it&#039;s gonna be there. Not every person on the planet is some kinda scammer rip off&nbsp; type of thief.&nbsp; Just because we deal in things that are illegal by government standards, doesn&#039;t mean we are without honor. It is basically just being smart enough and adult enough to not let some politician set the rules on your life. Who the hell are they? God? They are the biggest liars and thieves in the world. So their rules are meaningless to some of us. Not because we are criminals, but because we are the honest ones who have truth.

				Shouldn&#039;t be that much overwhelmed....basically everyone is just starting over where they left off.<br />I&#039;m sure all the vendors are like me and wish they could access the orders and be getting them in transit during the downtime but everyone is more than likely taking the day off.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				It is surely expected that their may even be orders that were placed and things have to be reverted back a day or two, hopefully not further back. I know that will make many vendors and buyers have to coordinate to make sure things are handled correctly.<br />Hopefully SR Support and Vendor Support can work together , along with the resolution center, to fix any issues.<br /><br />But we should trust the vendors anyways! They have been struggling more than us. We have coins to spend, and they are sitting as a lameduck, waiting for business to resume. I am sure some low level vendors are going to struggle to pay some bills on time.<br /><br />So taking internet circles and real life problems this caused EVERYONE, it should be understood that you give ALL THE VENDORS the most time they need to fix all the issues that may arise from this.<br /><br />I certainly hope that I can overwhelm my vendors with new orders!!!

I personally would not go near the stuff. Its only advantage a while back was that it was not on any banned substance list(at least in my country) so you could freely buy it in the shops. Even at that I stayed well clear of it.

				Me and my guy ordered stuff Thursday in the middle of the night when SR was up for a little bit before going down for good. Those things got here today. Even with the site down pretty much since I placed the orders. MAGIC

My stuff that&#039;s sold through my IRL links goes for around £20-25 a gram when it reaches the consumer because it&#039;s not cut so it&#039;s not a quarter of the price and when you take all the factors into consideration it shouldn&#039;t be a quarter of the price if it&#039;s pure anyway. Also Meph certainly does deplete your brain of Serotonin and Dopemine but just not in the same all-or-nothing way as MDMA but it can still cause depression. Also on top of that Meph is way more cardiotoxic and neurotoxic than MDMA. Finally, it&#039;s not &quot;stronger&quot; than MDMA either, in fact the potency of MDMA outmatches Meph on a molecule-to-molecule basis if you compare what it does. <br />

				For all my customers (I&#039;m a vendor on SR by the same name, QualityMeds), as soon as SR is back up, all orders will be shipped promptly. I don&#039;t see it taking more than one or two days to get all the pending orders shipped. Also, I still offer free samples of everything I sell, read my profile/signature at the end of my post here for my items. Message me with your name/shipping address and what samples you want to try out.<br /><br />Thanks DPR for all you are doing. I&#039;m sure you and your team are doing the best you can to bring SR back up and running. It&#039;s worth the wait to get it running faster and smoother.<br /><br />QualityMeds<br />&quot;QM&quot;<br />

				I totally agree with limitless on the drone. Was going to I love techno (festival in europe) a few yrs back and turned out our contact in belgium ended up in the hospital before we went. So went online, got 10g&#039;s of drone sent to his mates house in belgium and picked it up on the way after landing in the airport. Was crystal and all that craic. think 12e a g it worked out at. But and its a big but. None of us even finished our bags of it as we reached a certain point with it that taking more was doing absolutely nothing. And this was early in the night. Also have had some bad effects off it other than that on any other occasion I took it(which I could probably count in 1 hand). We all threw the stuff away in the end. Wasn&#039;t a bad batch or anything. Have got it from several reputible sources at the time. Its like an anti-climax of a drug, brings you to a certain point, you level off and theres no getting where you want to be .Have had multiple friends end up in the hospital with heart palpitations on several occasions. Give me a bit of propper MD any day over that rubbish and I will pay several times more than the price of drone for it.
