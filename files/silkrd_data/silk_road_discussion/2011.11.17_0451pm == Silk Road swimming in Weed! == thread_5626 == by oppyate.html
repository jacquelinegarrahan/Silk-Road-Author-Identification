				Anyone notice that there&#039;s been a great Increase in the Amount of good Weed by Vendors? Is it due to fact that most harvest&#039;s take place in October+ the curing or is it that more vendors are coming on board? If it turns into a Glut then it&#039;s a good thing for Buyers. Any thoughts or should I quit smoking weed and stop thinking about this kinda stuff?

				Yes it is, and that is the way I like it.<br />You should smoke more and help end the glut.<br />If this is your biggest worry, life is good.

				Very basic economics. More sellers = better prices = higher standards.<br /><br />Holland still has my vote. I&#039;m blazed off his product right now as it goes.

				&nbsp;8)<br /><br /><br />The are more varieties I couldn&#039;t&nbsp; possibly try them all, but I will give it a go.<br />I would think we need more buyers?<br /><br />I now know so many cannabis vendors that I couldn&#039;t even list them all.<br /><br /><br />So I did.........<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2837.0

				I may be dating myself, but back in the day Weed by the name of Panama Red &amp; Acapulco Gold were the Bomb. Everything was just plain Weed. A Dime Bag (a Quarter ounce) was 10 Bucks. The typical ounce was 40 bucks, 60 dollars max if it was seedless and super killer. I am amazed that 28 grams is costing over $350!! Personally, I think that&#039;s too high, even if THC is at 20% plus. There are a few Vendors right now that have &quot;no name-no pedicured&quot; weed that is fucking good and I paid about $180 and I&#039;m sure will compete with the Kush meets Purple Super Mario. But yeah, I think as more weed &amp; Vendors comes on the boards we should see some good pricing!

				You have to consider Medical Marijuana States like California and Colorado too. It is stupid easy to just walk down the street, pick up a bag from the store, then resell it on SR. There are more Marijuana Dispensaries here than Starbucks!
