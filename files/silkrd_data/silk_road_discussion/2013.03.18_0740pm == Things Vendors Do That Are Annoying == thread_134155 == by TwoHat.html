				I started this thread to vent about some things that vendors do that are annoying and to make them aware of those things. The intention of this post is to make vendors aware of things they may be doing that are annoying to buyers. I don&#039;t mean to complain or whine, there&#039;s no other way to present this information. I&#039;m not going to mention specific names, it would be better if we kept this to a general topic rather than talk about specific occurrences. I&#039;m going to list a few things that I have experienced.<br /><br />1) Not remembering prior or current conversation details.<br />2) Reading messages and not responding, or responding much later on.<br />3) Reading messages and deleting them to hide that they were read or for whatever other reason.<br />4) Not checking messages daily, or not checking back for important updates.<br />5) &quot;Last seen today&quot; and messages &quot;unread&quot;, avoiding reading messages for various reasons.<br />6) Taking more than two days to process orders.<br />7) Playing favorites with other buyers over pricing/assortment/quantity differences.<br />8) Poor curing of otherwise great quality bud, quantity over quality.<br />9) Lack of understanding what the term dank means.

There are some vendors that have to deal with a shitload of orders everyday.

I agree that a day or two is fine for processing time. I&#039;ll change it. Marking an order in transit before it&#039;s shipped is definitely not OK. Staff would probably want to hear about stuff like that.

It could just be that a lot of people do not know what good quality products are. I have not experienced a lot of the issues you mentioned thankfully.

				&nbsp;8) Damn you guys sure make me feel better about me only having a couple of those complaints. Vendors most often give you a great deal of info in or on their page. Not always right out in the open, though some are point blank and tell you they are an &quot;asshole&quot;. Now you have to decide if you want to deal with them or not, those are the easy ones. It&#039;s the ones that tell you this is a business and they are here to make money and take care of their customers blah blah blah but then out comes I don&#039;t check mail on the weekends or everyday, after eleven or before 3am. I have a real job, a life outside of here, come on you know what I&#039;m saying. They have the fucking 18 page bio that you dread reading but you know if you don&#039;t they are going to blame what ever it is that has you pissed off on the fact you did not read what they told you before you ordered if you have a problem with this buy from someone else. Any way I am not taking sides completely but you do have to read and read carefully what some of these vendor&#039;s pages tell you, because if I see certain key phrases or know they are completely wrong with a very important part of the transaction to me then I move on. Yep, even if it is the last or only fucker with it. Because like a bitch that knows she&#039;s hot and knows you want that thing. She can get you to do anything she wants with a meek hope or a blatant lie that you will get it the way you want it if you just..... they then can do what ever they want and you just get pissed off and start some whining thread about what they do that pisses you off....lol&nbsp; Seriously though, there are a ton of vendor&#039;s here and some of them SUCK real bad and some are really fucking GREAT. I have had either really good luck or just a knack at seeing something is not right with this one and move on...have fun with the wine...haha

				I&#039;m a vendor here myself, and while I agree with a lot of your stuff. Some of it is just unfair, you can&#039;t judge some of it unless you vend yourself.<br /><br /><br />1) Not remembering prior or current conversation details.<br /><br />No excuse for that. That&#039;s just basic memory skills.<br /><br />2) Reading messages and not responding, or responding much later on.<br /><br />If someone messages me bullshit about being short on postage or something. I&#039;m not going to reply. If someone messages me asking for a custom listing for 2 grams, and someones messages me wanting an ounce then the ounce takes priority. We are running a business. I do reply to all reasonable messages within 24 hours though.<br /><br />3) Reading messages and deleting them to hide that they were read or for whatever other reason.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think that would hide them. I am fairly certain SR staff can go back and see the deleted ones *I think*<br /><br />4) Not checking messages daily, or not checking back for important updates.<br /><br />Again, no excuse. Vendors are essentially businessmen and should take their business seriously.<br /><br />5) &quot;Last seen today&quot; and messages &quot;unread&quot;, avoiding reading messages for various reasons.<br /><br />Same as above.<br /><br />6) Taking more than two days to process orders.<br /><br />Unless they state that they have certain days off, or whatever.. Then that&#039;s not good business.<br /><br />7) Playing favorites with other buyers over pricing/assortment/quantity differences.<br /><br />This is unfair. If I have a long-term buyer who has placed 10 orders with me asking for an ounce, and a first time buyer asking for an ounce.. Of course the long term buyer gets priority/cheaper or whatever. That is how you run a successful business, happy, returning, loyal customers.<br /><br />8) Poor curing of otherwise great quality bud, quantity over quality.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sell weed so can&#039;t comment on that. But I buy it, and I feel your pain there.<br /><br />9) Lack of understanding what the term dank means.<br /><br />Again, a weed thing. Dank doesn&#039;t have a general definition, it can mean many different things in different areas.<br /><br />10) Marking &#039;in transit&#039; when it isn&#039;t in the hands of the post office yet. There is just no reason for this.<br /><br />When you have 30 orders, and only 3/4 are packaged and being sent. It&#039;s just easier to mark in transit. Don&#039;t see the problem as long at they are being sent on the same/next day.<br /><br />11) claiming stealth with 3 layers of food grade<br /><br />No excuse for this now with all the available materials we have to ensure stealth. Stealth is No.1, especially when you are sending drugs to people. If the vendors fucks up without good stealth it can have a huge impact on peoples lives. <br /><br />12) no visual blocking material if package is damaged revealing contents<br /><br />Even blocking might not work if the package is opened. I myself disguise the product so it looks like something else entirely and it seems to be making mu customers happy.<br /><br />13) product rattles around in box <br /><br />No excuse for that.<br /><br />14) cologne or perfume sprayed in package<br /><br />Yeah, that is a fairly stupid thing to do.<br /><br />15) after giving upgrade suggestions in friendly message - a reply with undertones of fuck you all over it<br /><br />Could just be the way someone talks. Unless they directly tell you to &#039;fuck off&#039; then don&#039;t take it to heart. <br /><br />16) lines of stamps used on package<br /><br />Why? Do you want your package to reach your or not? Because it needs to be stamped to reach you, or the vendor has to go in to the post office filled with CCTV cameras and that is not a good idea when sending illegal drugs.<br /><br />17) obvious fake feedback in forum and vendor page<br /><br />No excuses for that.<br /><br />18) over vacuum - compressed buds <br /><br />Ruins the smoke kinda, so I get that.<br /><br />19) Not put a return address on a package. (This fucking INFURIATED me)<br /><br />Why? As long as the package arrives, it&#039;s all good. No return address is better than a shitty fairly obvious fake one. And using one outwith the location of where the package is being sent that looks even worse than not having one.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be a dick guys, just thought you&#039;d like a vendors perspective&nbsp; :)

That&#039;s why you should always quote the entire conversation back to them with your latest response. <br /><br />#5 my all time most frustrating thing. Makes you go OCD, then try to convince yourself you&#039;re never getting issue resolved for sense of closure, to &quot;what was I thinking dealing with this vendor?&quot; But when a vendor does this, it&#039;s one and done as far as I&#039;m concerned.&nbsp; <br /><br />#6 I say more than 3 days to process. 3 days is really fine. And if there&#039;s a weekend between, I give a pass since some don&#039;t ship on weekends. Why 3 days? Because I can hit cancel on day 4. <br /><br />

				+1@SOUTHPAW: Thank you for your long response. Let me clarify. I&#039;m simply pointing out things that vendors have done that have annoyed me as a buyer. This can be constructive, because vendors can read this thread, learn about things they may be doing that are generally annoying, and avoid doing these things in the future if they choose to.<br /><br />+1@MrAnonymous: I agree with most of your points. The thing I mentioned about favoritism is arguable, you&#039;re right about the difference between a long term buyer relationship and a new one, of course. What I mean is in any situation where a normal favoritism outweighs proper business practices or principles. I will clarify that some in the op. It&#039;s good to get a vendors perspective, thanks.<br /><br />@Goblin: I&#039;m sorry that my post came off the way it came off to you. I do not want to piss anyone off. I just want to point out some things that I have experienced as a buyer that have annoyed me. In my case, the vendors I&#039;m dealing with are generally not slingin hard drugs and generally not pumping out hundreds of orders a day. In the case that you have too many orders to process by yourself, you should definitely consider getting some help. I know at least one vendor that has a different person manage their SR presence. As far as having too much business is concerned, I wish I had those problems. Some day when I have less responsibilities.<br /><br />+1@BenJesuit: @1: Not remembering conversations about things that do have details is inadequate memory performance, short term memory loss, retention issues, whatever, it&#039;s annoying. It&#039;s becomes my responsibility to compensate with redundancy. It&#039;s like being a manager. I agree that you should always keep the entire conversation available if that&#039;s what&#039;s needed in order to remember. @5: Waiting on replies makes me OCD too. @6: If I order on Monday morning and the vendor takes until Thursday to process the order, it&#039;s going to be annoying to me.<br /><br />+1@monrovia &amp; +1@Vika: I have read in the shipping section of the forums that lack of a return address is one of many criteria that they use to flag packages for searches. It&#039;s one small thing that can add to the chance of a package being searched according to posts in the shipping section. People have different opinions about this.<br /><br />It took a while to write all of those replies, I hope you guys read and enjoy them.

				&nbsp;??? So you are complaining that others lives do not revolve around your order? lol.. Please man, as someone else said, put yourself in their shoes and read EVERYTHING. I want my vendor to take their time when getting my order ready. The more attention to detail and less rush, means a safer transaction. You are getting things that you otherwise couldn&#039;t find, or you wouldn&#039;t be here. Even if it does take longer than you had hoped, at least you aren&#039;t left empty handed and with an empty wallet.

				20) Making false promises <br /><br />I understand the life of a vendor is an extremely busy and exhausting one, but if youre going to make a claim of service, just be able to back it up.&nbsp; Im currently waiting on a BTC order from a vendor who told me they would get to it within the hour, three hours ago.&nbsp; Buyers have lives too!

				^I think this is the most important. As long as a vendor lives up to what they offer on their vendor page, there&#039;s no cause for complaint.&nbsp; If it says orders processed within 1 day then that&#039;s what you expect. If they are busy and taking several days to process then they should state this on their page. If I can&#039;t find any information I will send a vendor a short plaintext message (for ease of reading) to enquire about current waiting time. I&#039;ve had too many frustrating days spent &quot;processing&quot;.&nbsp; I have no problem with long processing times as long as they are stated on vendor page

Some of it is just unfair, you can&#039;t judge some of it unless you vend yourself.<br /><br /><br />1) Not remembering prior or current conversation details.<br /><br />No excuse for that. That&#039;s just basic memory skills.<br /><br />2) Reading messages and not responding, or responding much later on.<br /><br />If someone messages me bullshit about being short on postage or something. I&#039;m not going to reply. If someone messages me asking for a custom listing for 2 grams, and someones messages me wanting an ounce then the ounce takes priority. We are running a business. I do reply to all reasonable messages within 24 hours though.<br /><br />3) Reading messages and deleting them to hide that they were read or for whatever other reason.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think that would hide them. I am fairly certain SR staff can go back and see the deleted ones *I think*<br /><br />4) Not checking messages daily, or not checking back for important updates.<br /><br />Again, no excuse. Vendors are essentially businessmen and should take their business seriously.<br /><br />5) &quot;Last seen today&quot; and messages &quot;unread&quot;, avoiding reading messages for various reasons.<br /><br />Same as above.<br /><br />6) Taking more than two days to process orders.<br /><br />Unless they state that they have certain days off, or whatever.. Then that&#039;s not good business.<br /><br />7) Playing favorites with other buyers over pricing/assortment/quantity differences.<br /><br />This is unfair. If I have a long-term buyer who has placed 10 orders with me asking for an ounce, and a first time buyer asking for an ounce.. Of course the long term buyer gets priority/cheaper or whatever. That is how you run a successful business, happy, returning, loyal customers.<br /><br />8) Poor curing of otherwise great quality bud, quantity over quality.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sell weed so can&#039;t comment on that. But I buy it, and I feel your pain there.<br /><br />9) Lack of understanding what the term dank means.<br /><br />Again, a weed thing. Dank doesn&#039;t have a general definition, it can mean many different things in different areas.<br /><br />10) Marking &#039;in transit&#039; when it isn&#039;t in the hands of the post office yet. There is just no reason for this.<br /><br />When you have 30 orders, and only 3/4 are packaged and being sent. It&#039;s just easier to mark in transit. Don&#039;t see the problem as long at they are being sent on the same/next day.<br /><br />11) claiming stealth with 3 layers of food grade<br /><br />No excuse for this now with all the available materials we have to ensure stealth. Stealth is No.1, especially when you are sending drugs to people. If the vendors fucks up without good stealth it can have a huge impact on peoples lives. <br /><br />12) no visual blocking material if package is damaged revealing contents<br /><br />Even blocking might not work if the package is opened. I myself disguise the product so it looks like something else entirely and it seems to be making mu customers happy.<br /><br />13) product rattles around in box <br /><br />No excuse for that.<br /><br />14) cologne or perfume sprayed in package<br /><br />Yeah, that is a fairly stupid thing to do.<br /><br />15) after giving upgrade suggestions in friendly message - a reply with undertones of fuck you all over it<br /><br />Could just be the way someone talks. Unless they directly tell you to &#039;fuck off&#039; then don&#039;t take it to heart. <br /><br />16) lines of stamps used on package<br /><br />Why? Do you want your package to reach your or not? Because it needs to be stamped to reach you, or the vendor has to go in to the post office filled with CCTV cameras and that is not a good idea when sending illegal drugs.<br /><br />17) obvious fake feedback in forum and vendor page<br /><br />No excuses for that.<br /><br />18) over vacuum - compressed buds <br /><br />Ruins the smoke kinda, so I get that.<br /><br />19) Not put a return address on a package. (This fucking INFURIATED me)<br /><br />Why? As long as the package arrives, it&#039;s all good. No return address is better than a shitty fairly obvious fake one. And using one outwith the location of where the package is being sent that looks even worse than not having one.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be a dick guys, just thought you&#039;d like a vendors perspective&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+ 1 <br /><br />FUCK some people on here whinge way too much.<br />Some vendors have hundreds of customers... They can&#039;t be expected to remember all conversations.<br />If you don&#039;t like the way vendors do things, use a different vendor or buy off the street. Simple.

				A good and valid thread here as a lot of vendors need a kick up the asshole but you have also got to understand how difficult it must be for them especially when their new.<br /><br />The worst thing a vendor can do is let you down in the communication department say for example you ask them a question and they take forever to reply and then when they do reply they dance around the question or sometimes don&#039;t even answer it, this looses vendors a lot of money as if a vendor cant or wont answer my question within 3 days&nbsp; I take my custom else where and that usually means about at least $300 in any one transaction and generally the more questions we ask the more we are about to spend, of course this is not always the case so its best to look at buyers stats and take into account what type of questions they are asking, are they going to get you that big sale you been looking for are they going to be a repeat customer,&nbsp; chances are yes!<br /><br />I mean not all vendors are bad with comms but the ones that know how to answer questions and deal with buyers needs are the ones that last, you cant just expect people to just buy a product then buy it again then buy some more with out talking to them first if that was the case every one would be a vendor, you need to be prepared to answer all questions big or small its usually the big questions that lead to the big sale.<br /><br />Said it before communication is every thing here, use it wisely, make sure you reply to questions and you will win the customers over every time.

				@Green Haze: You shouldn&#039;t assume that the only thing the op says is that I want vendors to process and ship my order immediately. Most of what I posted is not related to the time it takes to process an order. You should always read the entire original post.<br /><br />+1@anom +1@Hungry ghost: Yes, it&#039;s important that the vendors live up to any promises they make and anything they state on their vendor page or in messages. I have had two different vendors tell me one thing and do another on more than one occasion.<br /><br />+1@nomad bloodbath: Passing orders off to another vendor is sketchy for sure. They probably felt they were doing you a favor though by getting your order processed even thought they were not making anything on it, or a small commission.<br /><br />@jorg796: I&#039;m sorry that this thread comes off to you as me whining or complaining. That is not my intention. I have tried to clarify this several times. There&#039;s no good way to present this information that it does not come off that way to some people. If even just one vendor reads this thread and stops doing one of the things mentioned here that are annoying, then this thread is successful. The intention is to make vendors aware of things they may be doing that are annoying. I&#039;m sorry if you take offense to anything I posted. Please just ignore this thread if it annoys you.<br /><br />+1@isthereanyneed: Customer support and customer service are very important. It&#039;s just like you said, when people ask questions, it&#039;s because they are about to spend money. The answers to the questions could make or break the sale. It&#039;s important to take care of your customers.<br /><br />Responded to everyone and gave +1 Karma to everyone who posted a constructive response. I may add what people posted in replies to the op eventually.

It doesnt matter if it took a week or two to arrive, most things you order online take just that and I am having a real nice week actually thankfully.<br />

That&#039;s all motivated by just disagreeing with me right? You have not even made much of an attempt to point out what you actually disagree with from any post. Instead you just flame, say silly shit only a child would care about like that you think I&#039;m spoiled and ungrateful, or say that I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about when you don&#039;t know if I do or not and it&#039;s not about me anyway.<br /><br />@&quot;Did I send company an email bitching like crazy&quot;: This would be the equivalent to posting a thread about a specific vendor and a specific thing they did that was annoying. That&#039;s what you seem to have a hard time understanding. That&#039;s not what this is.<br /><br />@&quot;Vendors who risk going to jail bc of it&quot;: You realize that the buyers have a certain level of risk as well considering the packages have been processed through the mail system at the point when the buyer receives it right? The seller takes the risk to make money, not to provide the drugs, lol.

				One thing I never understand is.. how come (some, NOT ALL) vendors give the vibe that they are doing you some favor? Sure, they&#039;re selling you drugs.. but you&#039;re also giving them money. And in most cases a lot more then they&#039;d get IRL (due to shipping, fees) etc. You are taking your hard earned money to THEM for business instead of to the next vendor. Shouldn&#039;t that elicit some kind of appreciation or at the very least, efficient customer service? One the flip side, some vendors are fucking awesome. I&#039;ll name one. Costco.. he&#039;s a class act. He is thorough, efficient, responsive, friendly, goes out of his way to help/keep you posted on your order and puts you at ease. Takes his business very seriously. I love purchasing from him and will continue to do so. All vendors should treat their business like what it is, a BUSINESS.

				Lack of vendor transparency.<br /><br />A vendor I&#039;ve used quite regularly has been having problems with their set-up. Lost database etc. Anyway I got in touch and said I wanted to order but needed to know when they would have things resolved. I was told the next day at the max. So I waited a day and placed two orders. <br /><br />Guess what? Those orders sat in transit for 7 days. I sent a couple of emails. Nothing back. Checked on the forums what was happening. Same crap &quot;will have things resolved soon blah blah blah.&quot; I wait a few more days, still the orders sit in processing mode. I email the guy, tell him I&#039;m pissed off and that he should have been honest with me and told me to hold off ordering until things are 100% fixed. Still no reply even though they&#039;d been online that day.<br /><br />I eventually cancelled one of the orders and guess what? The second order (still processing) was amended to &quot;in transit.&quot; This of course could be coincidence, but I&#039;m very skeptical. I&#039;ve now placed an order with googleyed and if it all works well I&#039;ll move to use them as my vendor of choice in future. <br /><br />The learning for vendors is: be fucking honest and you&#039;ll earn the buyers trust who&#039;ll likely stick with you when you experience problems.<br /><br />Another issue with this guy is that all through his problems (which are ongoing) he has kept all his listings up. That is bullshit.

There&#039;s obviously a lot of emotion about this topic. I hope everyone can stay on topic. It&#039;s intellectually draining having to explain such simple concepts and repeat myself over and over.<br /><br />@HeatFireFlame: Yeah, never get comfortable...<br /><br />@Ktown99: Yeah, the first thing is just basic honestly. Marking the second order as in transit so that you could not cancel it is predictable, but shitty, especially if it&#039;s going to take 3 more days to process. I had something similar happen that created an issue with honesty for me with a vendor where another buyer was prioritized over me even though I was first in line even according to the vendor, up until the last minute, then everything changed.<br /><br />@thereefers245: Yeah man, that is some crazy shit you could never expect. I don&#039;t think I will ever order anything non domestic. I won&#039;t ever order anything too hard either.

				@blueveil @RoxiPal: I bet buyers do far more stuff that is annoying than vendors do. I&#039;m sure it drives the vendors crazy. There&#039;s a lot more buyers as well, so a lot more instances of annoying situations. You should start a thread tiled &quot;Things Buyers Do That Are Annoying&quot;. I&#039;m sure it would be a popular thread and it would be a great way to let buyers know which things they are doing that are annoying. Some people would change their behavior if they knew it was annoying. I guess it&#039;s best to just not message the vendors at all.

I&#039;m sure buyers do more annoying things than vendors do and at a higher frequency. It would be cool if there were two stickied threads, one for annoying things vendors do, and one for annoying things buyers do. Then direct new vendors and new buyers to the threads when they start out. I&#039;ll create a thread for annoying things buyers do using what you posted as a starting point.

				^ That&#039;s actually a pretty good idea. When I started buying I just combed through the forums and read as much as I could. That and I started PMing a random vendor who&#039;s profile looked insightful for advice/tips/newbie questions and he actually helped me a lot. Fuck it, I&#039;ll name him. RxKing. I just started picking his brain (I DO NOT ADVISE OTHER NEWBIES TO DO THE SAME AS HE IS VERY BUSY NOWADAYS), and he didn&#039;t have any active listings going that day so he gave me a fuckload of advice and told me how the entire process works. The do&#039;s and don&#039;ts. Will always be grateful to him for that. But this idea of a thread by vendors on what buyers do that is annoying.. I think its a fucking great idea. Mods?

It seemed completely obvious to me to start a new thread for things that buyers do that are annoying as well. Someone already posted in the thread and said that they didn&#039;t know that things on the list are annoying to vendors. He even asked for a vendor to explain why the things are annoying, that&#039;s called dialog. Imagine that, these threads can serve as a way of informing vendors and buyers about things they are doing that are annoying. I can&#039;t remember where I saw that posted in this thread 5 times.

				^lol. I love how the word &quot;cartel&quot; has become a household term here! This whole debacle was hilarious. Imagine if the cartels linked up with the &quot;assasination service providers&quot; on BMR and started using digital violence to wipe out the competition and/or fight each other. Like that poor guy who started this whole issue by copying/pasting the stuff from the Vendor Forum onto this forum.. if that poo guy ends up getting whacked by the cartel for being an informant.

				Two guys meet for a drink and its a cartel or gang these days!<br /><br />As for price fixing on coke, there is a bitcoin difference between vendors and more in some cases.<br /><br />What I find annoying about vendors is when they send some dusty mummified old hash, likely dug up with the Pharaohs! The pic of the listed 2 grams of hash was of a good looking solid shiny hash, what I got was the worse shit I have bought for years. Even worse, the vensor offered a resend of the proper hash so he or she sends half the original amount and the same dusty shit old hash, I&#039;d say a No 5 or No 6 hash - there was more stuck to the bag than I&#039;d ever seen. Ate 2 grams and felt nothing.<br /><br />But that was just one vendor and of the dozens I used I respect most and am the perfect customer, never moan if a UK tro UK delivery takes time - I actually wait like 12 days before I message the vendor and add on a week just in case. Buying is easy, we just sit back, read the menu or check our fav vendors. Vendors have to deal with rude customers, even threats. I&#039;ve seen pure venom in the cannabis thread - FFS! Maybe they are the ones who bought the same shit hash I got!<br /><br />Most vendors are spot on. They don&#039;t message me all the time and rarely do they ask for FE and usually I will never do a deal without the safety net and think my stats earn me that right. <br /><br />I hate to see vendors get sucked into some trolling match, I read the forums for info on the drugs not silly arguments which ought to be kept private. Its like people arguing on a mobile phone sitting next to you on the train. <br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t like it when vendors do not do good enough packaging. Most is pretty good, some excellent and I have only had one real sloppy job sent by a UK vendor who scammed off into the sunset. He sent a little weed baggie in an envelope, no paper or attempt to disguise it. Lucky it was shit UK bud, dried out in 2 days - grown by some 12 yr old caring for a heroin addicted mother.<br /><br />I like to see vendors stay between 96 to 100, that score does make a difference, and its a struggle for vendors who have got to that point but the only way is up so just treat customers better and don&#039;t mark &#039;in transit&#039; when its not!<br /><br />I think most vendors start off a little rough around the edges and evolve.<br /><br />I always like that little touch extra, say if its even just a touch over a gram its way better than being under. I suppose getting under weighed is a real annoying thing. But on the time this happened the vendor made good. <br /><br />So for me I kind of congratulate a lot of vendors. Some are honest people selling something that happens to be illegal in this current age. <br /><br />The very worse vendor is of course the scammer who robs off people who have worked hard to buy some treat. You can make a decent living being honest and a steady living. Scammers are not going to give a shit though and will just keep coming back in new guises. I bet for example Der Speed Doktor is still around here! 5 grams of go slow powder he sold me. But taught me lesson as I NEVER use speed now although will say YEs to some dexadrine which is euro Pharmacy standard amphetamine in tiny doses (5mg)&nbsp; that are still effective!<br /><br />Also find much amusement in coke vendors whose claims regarding purity are to be taken with a pinch of salt! Everyone has 87% pure, only, to be honest, I&#039;ve had some great coke off here but never that pure. Recent lab tests on the coke forum show more realistic results and more important (for me) they show levels of a chemical that cuts down white blood cell count,something I do not need as I&#039;m healing after an accident. Wish the wife would dress as a nurse, but thats the NHS for you! <br /><br />So thanks to all the honest vendors who risk a lot to make us all happy on Friday night or Saturday or both!<br /><br />And booo to the scammers! Hope you get scammed yourself one day, law of averages is every scammer gets scammed.<br /><br />What goes around!

				@ twohat- +1 for seeming to be an intelligent/level headed/down to earth dude. I like how you are trying to bring both sides of the argument to an understanding.<br /><br />To state what I think is the &#039;in between the lines&#039; content of this thread as succinctly as possibly, both buyers and sellers need to be patient and understanding of one another, and always put themselves in the shoes of the person on the other end of the transaction. Buyers want to be able to receive reasonable service and get a package come to their door that doesn&#039;t have multiple suspicious exterior qualities, and does have reasonable interior stealth and odor/visual barriers. Vendors don&#039;t want to be bombarded with questions that were already answered on their vendor page, or tracking requests that are obviously made too early to be relevant. <br /><br />One suggestion for buyers is to write &#039;NOT URGENT&#039; as the subject of a PM if the question is kind of menial, which is what I&#039;ve done on the few occasions that I have sent a somewhat unimportant question.<br /><br />I say again to buyers and vendors alike, put yourself in the other persons shoes, and we might be able to loosen some of this (kind of) invisible tension that has made itself apparent in this thread.

				I just want to say that this is one of the best, most informative threads I have EVER read on this forum.&nbsp; I literally started at the beginning and read all the way through until the very end and it kept getting better and better.&nbsp; This should be required reading for all noobs when they sign up for an SR account.&nbsp; It sure would save a lot of headaches for both buyers and vendors.&nbsp; The best part is EVERYONE can learn from both lists.&nbsp; As a vendor, I often put myself in &#039;buyer&#039; mode when I&#039;m considering what actions to take regarding orders, etc.&nbsp; Now, being a vendor, has also made me one VERY patient buyer, but I can appreciate buyers who act like I used to act when I was brand new - so it works both ways for sure.<br /><br />Thanks again to everyone who participated in this thread!

				This is great stuff!!&nbsp; To me the responses are more telling than the actual posts.&nbsp; I know vendors have to put up with junkies bugging them for their drugs and buyers do not understand when shit happens (and it does from time to time).&nbsp; I just wish I knew who the weed vendors are that &quot;do people favors by having decent quality delivered to their mailbox&quot; and the weed vendors who are adults and understand the concept of &quot;mutually beneficial.&quot;<br />If I wanted weed vendors that do me favors I would buy from the punk ass kids that are selling IRL.&nbsp; Kind of hoping to be rid of that rubbish and deal with adults on here.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br />
