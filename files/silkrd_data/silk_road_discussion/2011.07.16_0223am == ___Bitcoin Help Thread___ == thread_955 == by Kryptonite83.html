				Just trying to narrow down options..and get Bitcoin to SR as quickly as possible. From What I understand, a popular method is:<br /><br />Bank &gt; Dwolla &gt; TradeHill &gt; Bitcoin Wallet (mybitcoin) &gt; SR<br /><br />From what I hear though, lately, Dwolla is taking extremely long to process. Anyone have a quicker method? If so...post it as I did above. <br /><br />Also, does anyone know where I could purchase Bitcoin with Greendot MoneyPak?<br /><br />Maybe I am being optimistic, but I am hoping to get Bitcoin on SR with less than a 24 hour tourn-around.<br /><br />I think this thread could create some interesting discussion, as well as help new users through the process. Feel free to post any, and all, relevant info that you feel may help. This may also cut down on thread clutter.

Patience is a virtue, my friend. Look on the bright side, the bitcoin is slowly falling, so maybe by the time you get some the price will start going up and you would have &#039;bought low&#039;.<br /><br />There is a forum dedicated to bitcoin: forum.bitcoin.org I&#039;m sure there are plenty threads JUST like this on there.

				On Virwox you can trade Second Life dollars for bitcoin instantly. You can either send money into Virwox from a second life account or buy the second life dollars directly on the virwox site, then use the second life money to exchange for bitcoins.<br /><br />Then it will take a few hours to transfer the bitcoins out of virwox into another wallet, then into Silk Road.<br />They do have some nasty fees, not sure if they are higher than other exchangers though.<br /><br />Edit: btw, it is necessary to have a second life account before signing up to the virwox site, if I remember correctly.

				BUMP! Anyone have a recomendation in accordance with my last post? Should I just have Bitcoinexchange.cc send BTC directly to my SR Account? If not., what do you recommend for a speedy process? I am worried BTC will be sent, then the address will expire after the allotted 6 hours....and Im out of BTC.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; I heard mybitcoin is now scamming people too, so guessing they are out? I have DLed my own wallet, and just sent a sample transaction, but 4 hours later, block still building and no BTC. So, someone, anyone, help me out??

				if you&#039;re using bitcoin exchange i would have them send to a permanent wallet&nbsp; that you OWN (on your client on your computer that is encrypted) from there, you can do a transfer to mybitcoin.com if you want to add an extra transaction block (&nbsp; mybitcoin.com&#039;s online wallet has been known to &quot;magically&quot; have coins emptied from wallets be warned) from mybitcoin.com you transfer to SR, if you use virWorx you can transfer straight in to silk road.&nbsp; The extra adding of the address to mybitcoin.com is not really necessary in my opinion, but i would not try sending from any exchange directly into Silk Road because of possible delays.&nbsp; &nbsp;Silk road has increased the limit from 6 to 12 hours which is good but i would not risk trying to dump coins from an exchange directly to my account.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The fastest way i have found to obtain BTC&#039;s is to purchase moneypaks using cash and then going on bitcoin forums and selling them there or going on to the bitcoin IRC chat and finding some one to sell there.&nbsp; There are online escrow systems you can use, and reputable buyers will have feedback they can provide you.&nbsp; If they cant provide feedback i wouldnt go near them.
