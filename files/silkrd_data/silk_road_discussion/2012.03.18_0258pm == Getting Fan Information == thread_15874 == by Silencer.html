				I read about a vendor being able to see the usernames of the fans following him.<br /><br />Does anybody know how to do this. I would like to get a list of my own fans so I can send out fan specific messages.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Hmm, I&#039;ve never heard of that feature before. That could be pretty useful for vendors, but I wouldn&#039;t know how to do this considering I&#039;m just a buyer. Have you tried messaging an online moderator or a popular vendor?

				DigitalAlch - What if we wanted to have a fan only sale or give out samples only to fans. Personally I would like to show my fans my appreciation. Is there anyway to do this or does DPR just not want us to know who are fans are for some reason? <br /><br />Honestly I don&#039;t need to know their names. I would just like to do something like give out samples only to fans. Is this just not a possibility then?<br /><br />PaythePiper

				From what I understand, Fans can see your Stealth listings, so if you wanted to have a fan only sale you would need to put the listing into stealth and then your fans would only have access to those listings...<br /><br />Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.<br /><br />Galindoi

				as I understood it, if a vendor is in stealth mode, none of their listings are visible to the public, but &quot;fans&quot; can see them, but if a seller lists a single item as a stealth listing, then that listing is ONLY visible by a direct link. So if you wanted to offer some listings to the public, and some listings as stealth, then even your fans would not see the stealth listings without having the direct link to those listings. So it seems that in order to have a &quot;fans only&quot; sale, you would need to put your entire profile in stealth mode during the sale.

				That makes more sense, though it seems there is a lot of functionality that SR can add to this Stealth to make it beneficial to Vendors &amp; Fans.&nbsp; Hopefully more leveraging points will come out of this through evolution.<br /><br />Galindoi
