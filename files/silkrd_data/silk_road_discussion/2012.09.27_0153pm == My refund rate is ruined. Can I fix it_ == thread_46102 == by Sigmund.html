				So, I placed an order from some MDMA a month or so ago. The vendor required that I finalize early. I decided that I wanted to cancel my order and I told the vendor this before it was marked in transit. Over the next couple days, I heard nothing from the vendor but my package was marked as sent. The vendor finally messaged me back and told me that he wouldn&#039;t cancel the order because he had already sent the package. I figured since it was already in transit and my money was still in Escrow I had nothing to lose. I waited and waited and nothing ever arrived. I went into resolution and asked for a 100% refund. The vendor agreed and I got all my bitcoins back. But, at what cost? I had ruined my perfect refund rate! Without him even questioning the refund, it made me believe the package was never sent.<br /><br />Is there anything I can do to make my refund rate look better? I know that if I keep ordering things without getting refunds the percentage will go down, but is there anything else that can be done?<br />

				You&#039;re pretty much fucked! The same thing happened with me. I ordered from DiMiTri, and ended up getting a full refund, and now I have a refund rate of 7%, which is total bull shit because I have over 30 transactions, and the math doesn&#039;t add up. I&#039;ve messaged SR about it, and they say they can&#039;t do anything. <br /><br />There should be an area in the buyer stats that explains why there was a refund given. I have a perfect buying history, and because of an incompetent seller, it now looks bad to sellers when I place an order.

				This happened to me, I ended up with bad stats even though it was 100% the seller&#039;s fault and they admitted as much. Nobody&#039;s ever given me any shit for it and I&#039;ve made plenty of orders since.

				Maybe they should have two types of refunds.&nbsp; One for disputes (disputed refund) and one for honest errors (amicable refund).

				Refund rates aren&#039;t the biggest deal from a vendor&#039;s perspective - as long as they don&#039;t appear excessive. Just don&#039;t get an AF rate...

				I agree with farmer1, A 7% refund rate is not bad if you have a lot of transactions and have spent quite a bit, at least from my point of view. A 7% AF rate is bad.<br /><br />Most vendors will overlook a small refund rate because we know there a scam sellers and sometimes shit happens. If a vendor does ask, be honest and tell him what happened.<br /><br />

				Yeah I as well agree with Farmer and James.<br /><br />One of my first orders was for like 6 grams of bud but the guy had a fucking ridiculous AF&nbsp; of close to 50%<br /><br />I sent the guy a msg asking whats up with that, three days later I had no answer so I just canceled the order and sent him a msg that because he did not get back to me I had no choice but to cancel the order...<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind about a refund rate because my policies are simple in regards to that. If you have a lot of transactions and something goes wrong its only normal to have some refund rate.. Were talking about mail order drugs here... shit happens!!!

				yeah this sucks... SR should have a system to prevent refund rate from going up when it&#039;s completely vendor&#039;s fault.
