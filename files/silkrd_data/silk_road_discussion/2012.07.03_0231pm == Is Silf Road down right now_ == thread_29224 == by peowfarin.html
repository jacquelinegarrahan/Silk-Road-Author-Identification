				I made my first ever purchases yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; One seller had me finalize early - okay.&nbsp; An hour later I can&#039;t get on -&nbsp; message says that connection timed out, that silk road server not responding in time.&nbsp; Been about 15 or so hours now, and still the same.&nbsp; No problems with TorBrowser - I can navigate to other sites and pages just fine.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; I&#039;m new to this, and now I&#039;m getting a little skittish . . . at some point I may need to communicate with my sellers.&nbsp; What to do???

				Intermittent for me as well. New identity doesn&#039;t seem to be the issue here but trying to refresh a few times will get me on for a page or two and then it goes off again.<br /><br />I wish there was a Silk Road Online/Offline thread, I was looking for one earlier. I know it&#039;d get big but it&#039;s nice to know whether or not you should be trying to change identities or not, especially when you&#039;re on a faster than usual ID ;)

				I&#039;ve had something like this happen fairly frequently.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have like 2 tabs open from SR, and like 3 tabs open from the forums.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be browsing the forums, no problems, then I&#039;ll go switch to a SR tab, and it&#039;ll time out.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try the other tab, and it&#039;ll time out.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do a New Identity, and it&#039;ll time out.&nbsp; All the while, the forums and every other site is working fine.<br /><br />So at that point, I yank the USB, put it back and reboot.&nbsp; Rebooting inherently gives you a new identity, as well as reconnecting to your real network, and this seems to resolve the issue every time.&nbsp; Only once have I experienced a true SR outage in the past 12 months, and it was well documented on the forums as it was occurring.&nbsp; (LOL everyone was all up in arms, freaking out).<br /><br />NOW........CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THE ONION ADDRESS TO GET TO THIS MILF ROAD?&nbsp; I WANT A PIECE OF THAT!!!
