				I can&#039;t imagine anyone doesn&#039;t know but SuperTrips is SR biggest vendor or was.... Anyways lately, his shipping times have gotten horrible.&nbsp; Almost always 30 days plus.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t take that long to ship from Germany to USA. Many other vendors get it here in less than 7 days consistently.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t read a review in 2 months or so that said it arrived in any reasonable time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even some people in Germany have received their packages 30 days later.&nbsp; Those are the lucky people.&nbsp; Many have received nothing.&nbsp; Good thing is escrow has been refunding 100% to most people.&nbsp; The only problem is by policy on his page you are supposed to FE is its under 1k.&nbsp; <br /><br />If he is backlogged or whatever that&#039;s fine and understandable but he needs to update his profile information.&nbsp; Triple or quadruple his shipping times.&nbsp; Change where he says his Pm&#039;s are answered in 24 hours to I answer about 10% of pms with a copy and pasted message that I shipped it.&nbsp; When it almost all cases he hasn&#039;t.<br /><br />It is clear he is marking hundreds or thousands of orders in transit long before they are.&nbsp; No one on SR can do anything about this?&nbsp; Also why does he keep getting extensions in escrow?&nbsp; He should not be receiving any at this point.&nbsp; He is lying and breaking the vendor code on several fronts.&nbsp; <br /><br />This isn&#039;t some new guy with 20 transactions. We pay a fee to use Silk Road so when the largest vendor starts acting up I think the people have a right to know what is going on and why SR is covering his ass for him essentially.&nbsp; <br /><br />So basically can someone answer these questions<br />Is anything going to be done to make him update his profile?<br />Why is he getting extensions in escrow hasn&#039;t he lost that privilege? <br />What about the people who FE on a vendor who at the time has 97% or so feedback, was the biggest on SR as per his request.&nbsp; Will anything be done for them or are they just shit out of luck?

				good points, well made.<br />i have asked SR about it and they said<br /><br />&#039;They&#039;ve ceased new orders until everything is straightened out, their support is trying to get his things in order to be able to better help SuperTrips&#039;s customers. September made a big mess but once it&#039;s fixed everything will be running much better.<br /><br />~SR Support&#039;<br /><br />i&#039;m in escrow and have been extending 2 orders since 10th sept<br />but where does it end?<br />now he says he won&#039;t refund me 100% because i don&#039;t fit his refund policy, although i&#039;m still in escrow!<br />i have decided to not extend anymore, i&#039;ll let SR decide.<br />hopefully I&#039;ll get all my coins back, what do you think - i am a relative noob but have perfect stats so far<br /><br /><br />

				Why is it that even though he is in vacation mode he still doesn&#039;t have time to reply to my PM.<br /><br />I don&#039;t need an official statement because I think its obvious whats going on. I just want to know that I will be able to get a refund after I wait another 20 days or so...<br />My order&#039;s been marked in transit for 31 days. Come day 50 if its not here then I don&#039;t think that it was ever shipped out at all..<br /><br />The fact that he was still taking orders even though he was WEEKS BEHIND of being able to actually fill peoples orders says a lot despite him saying &quot;it is not my intention to rob you&quot;<br /><br />A few people claim to have received their orders, but a MAJORITY of people haven&#039;t gotten anything.. A majority means over half the orders..<br /><br />I want to have faith but after waiting for the post man every single day for the past 3 weeks and being let down every single time has crushed my spirit and my willingness to ignore the facts and believe he actually shipped my order.<br /><br />SORRY ST but the facts don&#039;t look good for you..<br />A poll was conducted and currently 81% of people who ordered between Sept 1 and Sept 20 have NOT RECEIVED THEIR ORDER. That is after at least a month of waiting.. Sample size is 38 people who participated in the poll.<br />31 people are still waiting.<br />7 people claim to have gotten their order, however most those 7 have less than 10 forum posts.<br /><br />Those are the facts. believe what you want.<br /><br />To participate in the poll and cast your vote go to http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=51798.30

				Been waiting 25 days on my domestic order now, which is ridiculous since it should take 3 days MAX.<br />I agree that SR should make a statement as it is clear that ST&#039;s handling of the entire situation is terrible.<br />If he can&#039;t reply to PMs even a week after he sends out mass PMs saying &quot;all is good and streamlined now, your order has been shipped&quot; (which clearly wasn&#039;t the case, at least for me), he can at least come into a 130+ long thread on the forum which consists mainly of people not receiving and complaining and make a public service announcement as to WTF is actually going on.

I mean, what point is there to rip people off if you can make boatloads of money just selling to them and keep them coming back? If he had just started I could understand this, but with his client base and his loyal customers it wouldnt have enough monetary incentive. Yeah, hed make a bunch from the past month of orders he took Im sure. But he could make that much every 2-3 months normally for the rest of his life. I think honestly he just got overwhelmed. <br /><br />*as I hope I wasnt ripped off for my 20g order*

				With all the FE, it&#039;s only a matter of time before ST becomes a scammer.&nbsp; When the amounts get insanely large, it&#039;s too tempting and easy to just take the money and start a new vendor account.

Really hope he&#039;s just behind and this isn&#039;t my first experience with a scammer... It&#039;s been around 26 days now, and still nothing. Being shipped to U.S. After reading all of the forum posts about him though, I&#039;m going to go ahead and assume the worst for now.<br /><br />The order was small too by the way. Only 25 speakers, to the U.S. I was hoping to have these a long time ago for a Halloween concert that I&#039;m going to, but it doesn&#039;t look like that is going to happen now. Also, being that I&#039;m fairly new to SR still, I was wondering if there is even anything that can be done if I was scammed because I FE&#039;d? (I had to FE because my order was under $500) Right now, I haven&#039;t heard from him in about 10 days, and before that it seemed like it was an automated message sent, telling me that he had sent it, which he obviously didn&#039;t. If anybody knows whats going on, or if I can do anything about a possible refund because of the FE situation, anything at all would be awesome and very helpful. <br /><br />Hope to hear back soon if possible, take care all.

				Man I&#039;m sorry to hear this,&nbsp; I remember when he shipped from the NL it took like 3 weeks and I thought that was bad. After 2 weeks I assumed it was gone and then randomly I get it. I can see why he had everyone FE, but I never re-ordered because I know that there are people on here who re-ship his product (or did atleast)<br /><br />If you want the good shit from the EU in the US go with a re-shipper, its a little more money but it saves time and its much safer and more likely to arrive, so essentially its the same price &quot;time is money&quot; as ppl say

				wow..&nbsp; soemthing definately has to be done with this type of trend of awesome vendors going downhill very fast..&nbsp; whats funny is i was lured onto SR from first trying one of supertrips stuff..&nbsp; the guy we got it from wouldn&#039;t reveal his source but he would tell me it took a few weeks to get and he was taxing them to insure the cost of lost/seized orders prob due to FE..&nbsp; then I cut him out and found out about SR myself and I never once placed an order with ST after realizing there are tons of other options on here who ship way faster.. so far, i&#039;ve had 100% pleasant transacitons with everybody else and orders from europe to western US coming in as fast as 6 to avg about 2 weeks.. where I never understood why wait for those questionmark pills when you can get similar or better elsewhere.. guess he does have a loyal fan base but when this stuff happens, geez.. I don&#039;t know what to think...Im definately not gonna FE for anybody now as there are other vendors who stay true to escrow despite buyer scams...or as some vendors do, setup FE for certain buyer stats only... so far I have one final FE im waiting for and im hoping all is well but im gonna be optimistic but lately orders have followed the same trend...taking longer and longer to receive as the weeks go by but they are definately coming in.. but on the bright side, listings were pulled recently hopefully to work on fulfilling backlogged orders.... maybe they do get overwhelmed but VENDORS please pull your listings if you&#039;re getting backlogged and can&#039;t catch up with demand.. a drop in your service and delivery time isn&#039;t worth losing your customers over.. just my 2 bitcoin

				That was not the point at all.&nbsp; The point was how does SR miss this let me give you some highlights.<br /><br />-Biggest vendor on silk road<br />-2 months of people complaining about shipping times <br />-SR granting him extensions in escrow<br />-Many people shipping from the same country get it here in 7 business days he is taking 30-50<br />-His profile says 6-12 days shipping time<br />-His profile says PM&#039;s will be answered in 24h many people never get them answered or wait 2 weeks+<br />-Infinite complaints to support about this yet nothing is done clearly<br /><br />The point is Silk Road knew this was going on and did NOTHING.&nbsp; Hundreds if not thousands of people were complaining him marking items in transit long before they were, not shipping at all, shipping empty boxes, not answering PM&#039;s, lying about shipping times ect.&nbsp; Yet nothing was done.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a service we PAY to use.&nbsp; A hefty amount might I add considering if the biggest vendor is allowed to scam tens of thousands over a 2 month period.&nbsp; I and many others fully understand this is not a fool proof process and it is possible to be scammed.&nbsp; Something like this should not slip through the cracks.&nbsp; Funny thing is this is the third time in recent history the biggest vendor has scammed many people.&nbsp; So you think they might be onto something like this but no, looks like the whole support team is just sitting with their thumbs up their asses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also for the record I didn&#039;t finalize early.&nbsp; Now I will have to wait 10 more days in escrow before I might see my money after already waiting over 30.&nbsp; I&#039;m&nbsp; sure they will give him another extension though.&nbsp; Pathetic.<br /><br /><br />

				there should be a button &quot;Product not received&quot; when giving feed back.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have to be a public record against any vendor.. <br /><br />but if the product not received to product received ratio gets to a certain level, the vendor is automatically temporarily suspended.<br /><br />The reason for this, is too many people just give the vendor 5 out of 5 regardless, perhaps they got 50% back and are happy about that, or they are offered a reship or whatever.. but they can still mark, product not received as the vendor cant hold it against them because they never know.<br /><br />This certainly wont stop all scamming, but it&#039;ll shorten the amount of time they can do it for.

It&#039;s called Personal Responsibility.If after all the warnings, which are posted both here on the forum and on the SR Homepage by DPR himself, you still make the decision to FE and subsequently get screwed, you&#039;ve only got yourself to blame. I sympathize with the situation your currently in and detest any vendor taking advantage of buyers who do FE, but if your coins were still in Escrow and the vendor was found to be scamming, your coins would be returned to you. It&#039;s about minimizing your risk in all that you do here.

				I knew that when i placed my order i&#039;d be waiting for a while as he made it perfectly clear on his profile that he was behind with orders. I placed the order on the 12th september, the order wasnt acknowledged until the 22nd (10 days processing is quite long but given the circumstances i just accepted it). There was no communication from ST what so ever and i was never asked to FE so i assumed he was happy to use escrow (the money is still there.) Its now exactly one month to the day and i&#039;ve not recieved anything. I&#039;ve been very patient and very polite, there has been SIX extentions and i&#039;ve still heard nothing from him. I have made it clear that i would just like a refund so i can order elsewhere as it clearly isnt working but it keeps being extended with no communication from ST. Where do these extensions end? Its driving my crazy!<br /><br />EDIT: just noticed that ST was last seen 4 days ago. Worrying... but hopefully i&#039;ll get a refund from the staff as the money is still in escrow. My fingers are crossed.

				UltimateSolution and others are right, please stop FE&#039;ing people. I know how tempting it can be, I was going to give ST&#039;s coke a go until I saw he requested FE and how long all the orders were taking to arrive. There really is no reason a vendor should request you to go out of escrow.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6058.msg250486#msg250486">Quote from: ZenAndTheArt on May 20, 2012, 10:14 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">PEOPLE, THIS IS FROM THE SELLERS GUIDE<br /><br />Cash advance<br />From your account page, you may accept advance payments on your orders that are currently in escrow. You&#039;ll see four numbers and a form field in a “cash advance” control panel. The first number is your limit. If your total outstanding advance payments meet or exceed this limit, you may not accept any more cash advances. The next number is the total of your advances currently outstanding. The third number is the difference between the first two, the total still available to you. The fourth number is the current fee for taking a cash advance. When you put the amount you want advanced to you in the input field and click go, that amount is immediately credited to your available account balance. This credit comes from the expected payments of your most recent transactions. When those transactions are eventually finalized, your account is not credited for them because you have already been paid. If a full or partial refund is issued for one of the transactions, your account is debited by the amount you were advanced plus the fee (or a prorated amount in the case of a partial refund).<br /><br />For example, you sell a 20 btc item and then a 10 btc item. Your account page tells you that you have a 15 btc cash advance limit and the fee is currently 10%. You need all 15 btc, so you enter in 15 and click go. First, you are advanced 9 btc from the most recent 10 btc sale (10 btc minus the 10% fee). Then you are given a partial advance from the previous sale: 6 btc for a total of 15 btc. Let&#039;s say the 20 btc sale goes off without a hitch and the buyer finalizes the order. At that point, you would be paid 20 btc minus the 6 you were advanced, minus 10% of 6 (0.60 btc) for the fee, for a total of 13.4 btc. Next, let&#039;s say the 10 btc sale goes to resolution and you give your customer a 100% refund. In this case, you&#039;ve already been advanced 9 btc and need to pay the 10% fee for a total of 10 btc, the original price. Therefore, 10 btc will be subtracted from your available account balance. If this causes your account to go negative, then any future deposits or payments will go toward reducing that negative balance.<br /><br />The limit and fee are both self-adjusting according to a few simple parameters. The limit is governed by how much recent business you&#039;ve done, and how much money you are expected to be paid from escrow. The fee is determined by the supply of and demand for the funds available for cash advances. <br /><br />THIS IS FROM THE SELLERS GUIDE.<br />I&#039;m not sure how many people realize this! If a vendor is that short of money he has to ask to FE on small items (firstly, should he really be a vendor on here at all), he could have a +10% listing price for customers willing to PAY not to FE. This does happen. Then the vendor gets his cash advance (without losing 10%), the buyer stays in escrow, no FEs and everyone&#039;s happy!?! I know there&#039;s a limit to the vendors advances, but surely something can be worked out.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As someone said before, the more people FE the more vendors will ask people to FE. Stay strong, stick together and vote with your feet. Imagine if everyone stopped using vendors who [1] request FE, [2] don&#039;t use GPG and [3] are overpriced!<br /><br />To everyone who is still waiting on ST, I hope everything eventually works out well for you. It sucks waiting on an order, I really feel for you.<br />&nbsp;:)

				Well, just one day after i posted about my situation the SIlk Road staff offered a 100% refund and i now have my coins back. I am somewhat releived that this is all sorted out but im a little gutted i never got the chance to tryout the product. Maybe i&#039;ll order again in the future when this is all straightened out.

				hey i dont know the details for ST but sometimes you click to confirm the order with the order packed and ready to go, then life happens between you and the postbox, so somethings get delayed. Once the orders confirmed there is no details of your address so I have no idea if one of the 3 packages i forgot to post yesterday, because some unexpected shit arrived on my plate, is your order or not.

That sounds like the kind of problem ST is having, but another 10% are very impatient so inflates the figure.<br /><br />Also, chill out a little man, DPR is just being the usual impartial person, nothing wrong with that. She is right, we have no evidence he&#039;s done something wrong, only our suspicions and assumptions which can be inaccurate.

I havent&nbsp; ordered from ST, but I orderd from PF in the day, and his total transactions for however many months he was working for was like between 2000 &amp; 3000..&nbsp; (you can see total transaction when you go into resoltuion)<br /><br />I would guess ST would be similar, I dont think he would be 1000 a month (i could be wrong). There seems to be alot of people, more than 10, who havent received&nbsp; off ST.. So that figure would be MUCH higher than 1% of a months worth of postings.<br /><br />The other thing that is worrying thing is the way he operates. He should only mark them in transit the day before he goes to post them.. Not mark them in transit and get around to doing it. As a customer, I like to know the day (or close to) that the item is posted, this helps me estimate my ETA.

				As a Vendor on the road I have to say that people like chasezip2201 is what is wrong with SR. To me he is like the guy that sues the car company for a car accident because he can&#039;t get any money out of the other driver. SR has no responsibility to baby sit vendors nor do they owe you anything. What they have offered is a safe place for you to receive drugs so that you don&#039;t have to deal with sketchy drug dealer on the street where you could get shot over a bad deal. And by the way you are not paying for this service, the vendors are. It is free to sign up for consumers. Fees are paid by vendors and are included in the price that the vendor sets. Please try to remember what it was like to score on the streets before you found this site.

You wouldn&#039;t complain to the mall because footlocker sold you a pair of crappy shoes would you? No you would take it up with footlocker. Try to take it easy buddy, shit happen and when it does it sucks. There is always an alternative, you could go back out to the streets and try to get your drugs there. Also remember that there are plenty of scammers on our end as well. We have a whole page worth.

				Knowing very little about what scammers usually do, is Supertrips going in stealth mode a good/bad/neutral sign? I&#039;m not getting my hopes up but does that just mean hes working through the backlog before he goes public again?

				&quot;We have the right as customers to demand better.&quot;<br /><br />I think you will actually find that our rights hinge on the fact that what we are engaging in is constitutionally above board. <br /><br />When we are dealing with a market place of globally banned / scheduled items , you have no rights at all. It is all essentially a gamble, or calculated risk. <br /><br />I equate SR to gambling. If you want to roll, expect to lose it all.

				Hi folk,<br />Noob poster here. I&#039;m in the following situation regarding supertrips. I have a couple of orders in since late September, finalised early as he requested (I know that&#039;s stupid but hey, call me stupid - anyway, this isn&#039;t a complaint) and like many others, haven&#039;t heard any response to pms. <br />My question is, has anybody been receiving their deliveries recently? I know that SR have been in touch with ST and I can see that ST has said they are working through the backlog but have we seen evidence of this in the real world? Are orders being fulfilled? I have plenty sympathy for them, I can see how things could quickly get crazy if you over-extend yourself but I&#039;d love to hear that people were actually receiving their orders now. Anyone?

You don&#039;t like SR, your problem. As gonzorx has kindly pointed out quite well, SR is a gamble effectively with no guarantees of anything.and reputation is everything here collected over time, and I see you&#039;ve done a fine job of getting started already. If you want to insult the big dogs, I hope you&#039;re ready for a long and very negative forum stay because people like me just don&#039;t care when you try to use insults such as &quot;Why don&#039;t you go tell your mom people are being mean to you on the internet&quot;, it&#039;s immature at best, not to mention I&#039;m British so &quot;moms&quot; are non-existent over here with your defiled version&nbsp; of our language.<br /><br />&quot;They get very rich off of this service&quot; - if you believe that then you&#039;re delusional and don&#039;t know how this trade works. I made a lot of money from it, most vendors on SR don&#039;t because of the logistics behind it. Sure they turn a little profit, but I doubt many vendors here get rich in any way from it. There are some exceptions obviously, but very few. My deals are mainly IRL based.<br /><br />&quot;This is a safety issue more than anything.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t see that you are blind.&nbsp; Right now as I sit here how do I know customs didn&#039;t find my package and is going to bust my door down.&nbsp; How do I act accordingly?&nbsp; I can&#039;t.&quot; - What is the difference between a ST package intercepted and any other package? If they come knocking down your door, then it&#039;s your fault for not being prepared, every good buyer and seller here knows that you should expect them to come at any time. If they have the package, remember that anyone can send you something in the mail. If you&#039;re successfully charged for being sent drugs in the mail, you are a complete idiot as it must be the easiest charge in the world to get off clean. Sure they&#039;ll have your address marked and may keep an eye on you, but that ain&#039;t prison.<br /><br />&quot;The point is SR knew this was going on.&nbsp; How many people work in the service center do you think?&nbsp; 10? 100?&quot; Yep, you&#039;re delusional if you think even 10 people work at SR support. They knew it was going on sure, they read the forums, but that doesn&#039;t mean they should just shut the thing down, that isn&#039;t their job. Their job is to settle disputes and keep things in working order, that&#039;s all they provide so your customer right shit is completely out the window. <br /><br />Also you seem to be bitching a hell of a lot on one vendor, please explain to me just when you ordered your products? If you ordered when the delays were apparent (mid-august it all started I believe), then it&#039;s your own fault completely for not taking that into account. As said, SR is provided as-is and it&#039;s your job to do the research and your place to accept the loss if it doesn&#039;t show up.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I don&#039;t understand how anyone can take SuperTrips side on this matter. He said to me that he dispatched an order that never arrived, he did this not only to me but to several people. There isn&#039;t really any justifiable reason for doing this, it is a blatant lie. Not only that but the first part of my order that did arrive took over a month, based on the date on the packet he took 3 weeks since marking it as dispatched to actually dispatch it. During this time I even messaged him asking if it had been dispatched and asking if I can cancel my order. The second part of the order never arrived and I received a 100% refund. I can say with 96% certainty that it was never dispatched despite SuperTrips telling me more than once that it had been. <br /><br />During this whole period he carried on taking orders despite being backlogged.<br /><br />Things SuperTrips did wrong that I challenge someone to justify:<br /><br />1. Marking orders as dispatched then taking almost a month to dispatch them.<br /><br />2. Keep on taking orders despite being backlogged with orders and messages for like.. at least a month before he stopped taking orders.<br /><br />I&#039;m not having a go at SuperTrips, I just don&#039;t understand these people that are taking his side: SilentBob, Limetless amongst others. What he did was wrong. Just because it&#039;s drugs doesn&#039;t mean sellers should be able to do what they want. Guess what, as buyers on SilkRoad we are taking certain risks as well and this whole &quot;If you don&#039;t like it then fuck off&quot; attitude is something I don&#039;t understand. If he had some sourcing or restocking problem or bitcoin-cashing-out-problem, you know what, that&#039;s fine. Stop taking orders IMMEDIATELY, explain on your vendor profile that you are experiencing problems, if the problem won&#039;t be rectified within a week then give people the option to cancel. Is that too much to ask?<br /><br />Overall though I am NOT blaming DPR or SilkRoad for any of this, shit happens and from where I am standing SuperTrips is at fault, whether intentionally or not is kind of irrelevant. I don&#039;t think DPR or SilkRoad could of prevented this mess, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair for chasezip to blame them but I think the people having a go at chasezip needs to back of, he does have some valid points. A buyer that is buying for thousands of dollars is taking almost as much of a risk as the seller if not more simply because it&#039;s the seller that has the control. The buyer can&#039;t do anything but wait. It&#039;s the sellers responsibility to keep the buyer in the &quot;know&quot;, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s too much to ask.

I really don&#039;t see why people who aren&#039;t involved in this are leaving comments when they don&#039;t seem to fully understand the situation. Anyway.. I received my refund a while back and have no outstanding issues with SuperTrips, I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m still posting about it. I guess I feel bad for the people who finalized early. It&#039;s a shame people will still finalize early, I can see there&#039;s going to be a lot more scams to come. <br /><br />Didn&#039;t DPR tell vendors they couldn&#039;t request FE quite a while ago but then some vendors (I think Ivory was amongst them) had a problem with this and in the end vendors were allowed to if they had a certain amount of stats? I could be wrong. I just hate this trend where vendors aren&#039;t even allowing buyers with good stats to stay in escrow. Not only for my own reasons but I really hate seeing people get burnt.<br /><br />(By the way, what&#039;s with that russian post?) :P<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=55787.msg553311#msg553311">Quote from: GiveUsSome on October 29, 2012, 09:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">is it my imagination, or is it always the coke dealers who do the runner?<br /><br />dealers selling psychedelic and other shit i hate, seem to stay here forever ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Yeah, it seems to be exclusively heroin and cocaine vendors (tony, noriega).

				Ok so checking in with my problem. Read the entire thread. Here&#039;s my problem<br /><br />Order placed and address sent 26 days ago. Marked as shipped a few days later. Then message 16 days ago (10 days AFTER original order is placed) that says &quot;Sorry for the late response, forwarding your PGP encrypted message to SuperTrips&quot;.<br /><br />None of the messages sent to ST have been read. So, because of this &quot;delay&quot; in shipment, SR auto-finalized from the day he marked it shipped not the actual date of shipment, if it was even shipped at all. <br /><br />I was unable to log into SR for an extended amount of time and was unable to hit resolve in time. In this time period it was auto-finalized, so I am not out of escrow. <br /><br />Have been messaging ST in hopes that he will read my messages, but none have been marked as read. I am not flaming to him, mainly asking if it was shipped, when, etc. Also, SR basically said i&#039;m SOL because of the auto-finalize.. when it was never shipped. <br /><br />TL;DR It have been 26 days since original payment and message. Fyi, bought an O.

				After over a month and a half of extensions on top of the original 20 days of shipping, I finally messaged supertrips again. About 6 hours after that I received a refund of 0%. Given that it was a decently large order (100 white speakers) this is kinda disappointing and a little confusing.<br /><br />Anyone know if he&#039;s reportedly honoring his old reship policy?

				Depends on the vendors terms &amp; conditions. With SuperTrips if you have under 5 transactions on the site you are eligible for 1x re ship but no refund. After 5x transactions you are eligible for a reship or a 100% refund, at the vendors discretion.

Greed gets those drugs smuggled to you from across the globe. Greed is what makes you take the drugs in the first place. Greed&#039;s a good reason to do most things that make life worth living. But greed&#039;s not the issue here. The issue is that there&#039;s a large amount of demand, a large amount of supply, and not enough labor to cover all of it. I guarantee you he has all the drugs that you&#039;re ordering, but when a couple hundred of you order those drugs every day, how&#039;s he supposed to get em out in time? It&#039;s just a recipe for getting more and more behind. And like I said, if he goes on vacation he&#039;s still fucked. He&#039;d just get an explosion of orders on the day he&#039;s available.<br /><br />And I do side with you on the processing thing, BUT like another user said his policy is FEing on any order under 1k so he has to mark the order in transit in order for people to FE before he gets the orders out. You can&#039;t FE if the order isn&#039;t marked in transit. I imagine that makes up the bulk of the problems.<br /><br />Not to mention all of the problems just BETWEEN the packaging and shipping of the items. Guy this busy I couldn&#039;t even imagine doing what he&#039;s doing - how much driving he must have to do all over his whole fuckin region just to get all of the orders he has time to do out of the country. And then there&#039;s a million other problems that could occur between when he buys the drugs on one end of the globe to when they&#039;re in your hands on the other. Hell, even AFTER that there&#039;s the possibility of some asshole scammer trying to gauge him for more product or a refund. Must fucking suck to be ST. It already sucks to be me and I run about 5% of the game he does.

I&#039;ve still no idea what the motivation is, but it&#039;s getting hard to avoid the fact that good vendors are being &#039;encouraged&#039; to leave.

				But then the services of BTC vedors become inaccessible and the BTC vendors do no more business....<br /><br />I&#039;ve run into the same problem on my kissbang account on BMR... There is a lot of money to be made in helping the scammers. I was one of only two legitimate vendors selling firearms. Why? Because I&#039;m that good. People send me BTC direct now, in advance. I always deliver. Why? Because I&#039;m not in it for the money. Of course, we know what happened there...<br /><br />If your income is based on a transaction percentage, do you have any concern if the transaction was real or not? As with BMR, as was TA, when most of the market is scams, and you deliberately don&#039;t do anything about it because you&#039;re making way more money off the scammers&#039; commissions than the few legitimate vendors.... Get rid of the legitimate vendors.<br /><br />A free market doesn&#039;t take a vote, it&#039;s free to all.<br /><br />Now, it seems like I&#039;m off on a tangent, but there is a reason for it.<br /><br />They&#039;re losing sight of the big picture, or never cared about it to begin with...

				I&#039;m thinking that a lot of people don&#039;t understand that most popular vendors are likely getting hundreds of messages and tens of orders a day which can get to be very overwhelming. :/ Which in some cases can cause slow or not shipped mail, you have to give the benefit of the doubt in some cases because I don&#039;t believe some of these HONEST vendors are out there to get your money as a whole. Sure they&#039;re going to want some profit for the product they&#039;re providing, but in a sense, a lot of these people that I see have been called &quot;scammers&quot; and what not, have all had a very good track record till they become extremely busy with traffic. Some times patience is key for this sort of thing and if it happens to not work out as planned work something out and remain calm, I&#039;m sure there are plenty of vendors out there that are completely good to there costumers but just lose a sense of organization as they most likely have lives outside of the SR world...<br />

I mean the guy&#039;s pretty damn popular, I&#039;d just give this thing some time and sit back and hopefully he&#039;ll work things out. Because, honestly do you think that if a vendor intended to just rip a bunch of people off and not send them their stuff that he would be back selling again after everyone knows exactly what he did? It really doesn&#039;t make any sense to me at all why anyone would do such a foolish thing.. Just keep calm, shit does happen, especially with this sort of thing. Hopefully things will work out for my friend, but only time will tell and this is when patience really does need to come into play.

				Well, you&#039;re lucky. It&#039;s been two days since I sent my transaction number. I&#039;m glad everything is getting worked through, but I think SuperTrips should have refunded the people that lost hundreds of dollars before selling again. We&#039;d all be happy campers by now. Lesson learned, no more finalizing early for me!

				After weeks of no order showing up and more weeks of unread PMs, ST got back to me a couple of days ago after I messaged him again to try to get a refund one last time. Amazingly enough, he (or his support) replied, asking for my transaction numbers so that he could refund my orders (which were FE).<br />Gotta say this has made me pretty euphoric and given me hope I may see my coins come back after all!<br />Fingers crossed..<br />Anyone had their FE order refunded to them yet?

				Refunded my money finally - He updated his profile stating the issue ...I know its his fault but he seems like he is getting his act together .. tough thing is that he isn&#039;t getting orders back and putting all his money out to get everyone caught up ..<br /><br />I am excited to see what happens , his shit was the bomb considering ordering again with a small amount to see how it goes then a bigger one.<br /><br />Maybe since he is not getting order it will be delivered fast.
