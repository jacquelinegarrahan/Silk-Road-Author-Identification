				I actively trade bitcoins.&nbsp; SR right now says 102.82 but mtgox says 106.80.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s almost a 4% difference.&nbsp; So if I use the SR price, my sellers get angry.&nbsp; But if I use the mtgox price, which I have always done, then my buyers get angry.&nbsp; And if I use an average of the two, no one is happy.&nbsp; What price do you guys think I should use?

				I have my settings set to display in US currency. Maybe that&#039;s why? At the bottom of each page I see the value of 1 BTC in USD.<br /><br />If you go to Account -&gt; Settings you can choose which currency to display prices in. Try setting it to your currency of choice and see if the BTC price pops up on the bottom left of the normal SR site.

				Ideally the value would be weighted most by how much the btc are actually bought for by the buyers themselves, though that is impossible to know.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is certainly higher than the exchange listed values as exchanges charge fees on top of those prices.

				It doesn&#039;t matter that much what the SR BTC value is. You can adjust for it in your pricing (as a vendor) or in your choice of vendor (as a buyer).<br /><br />As a vendor:<br />If the SR rate is overvalued then raise your prices by whatever percentage you feel appropriate to make up for the loss.<br />If the SR rate is undervalued then lower your prices to increase demand.<br /><br />As a buyer:<br />Simply decide if whatever listing you are considering is worth it to you for the price you are going to pay.

				So, as a new vendor, I was a bit surprised the first time I went to cash out. <br />I recently saw a post from DPR where he explained that the BTC value was no longer tied to MtGox and is now calculated with a formula weighted to the different markets. Can&#039;t seem to find where that was. Maybe the seller&#039;s guide? Does anyone remember where that&nbsp; link is?<br />Here&#039;s the problem. MtGox is under new regulations that do not allow the free market to determine BTC value at MtGox. The effect is that the MtGox price will only become more elevated compared to unrestricted exchanges. Considering that virtually zero silk road buyers or sellers are likely to be still using MtGox, I think MtGox should be removed from the formula.<br /><br />The effect is one of putting everything on sale (without vendor consent) which drives revenue and would be good for buyers and DPR, but generally bad for vendors. Vendors (almost none of whom would use MtGox) should not need to continually raise prices to compensate for this issue. <br /><br />DPR, you recognized the problem and I appreciate the step in the right direction, but it&#039;s time to solve the problem by removing MtGox from this equation. This issue will only get worse until a permanent solution is found.

I don&#039;t think we should base prices on localbitcoins unless you base them 50% between the bid/ask. You can&#039;t reasonably base it on the average ask. I admit that the average ask is a bit on the high side at localbitcoins. But that is temporary due to sellers capitalizing on new bitcoin buyer&#039;s ignorance and the delay for people to understand that the MtGox prices is no longer reflective of the true market.<br /><br />Lots of buyers are using coinbase then doing a shared receive or shared send from blockchain.info which only costs .5%.
