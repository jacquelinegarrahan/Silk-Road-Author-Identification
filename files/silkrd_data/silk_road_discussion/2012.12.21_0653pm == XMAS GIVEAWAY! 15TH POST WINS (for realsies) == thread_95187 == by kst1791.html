				hi y&#039;all,<br /><br />so i was offered a gift by a vendor that i personally can&#039;t use, and the vendor generously agreed to let me give it away as a gift! i&#039;m not sure what quantity exactly, but it&#039;s &quot;a generous sample&quot; of cocaine from canada from the following vendor:<br /><br />Silk Road Vendor Account<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/de05bf8f6c<br /><br />Review Thread<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94273.msg666291#msg666291<br /><br />This is not a scam! The fifteenth poster on this thread can contact the vendor on the road and receive the gift he offered me (we&#039;ve already agreed). Good luck! I don&#039;t know this vendor but he seems pretty cool and smart, and hopefully whoever is the beneficiary of this will give him a fair and honest review on his vendor review thread.<br />:)

				Thanks, all! I&#039;m gonna pay it forward right now and say give it to someone else. It wasn&#039;t my intention to win. Bud &amp; shrooms are this mama&#039;s DOC. There were only 4 posts listed when I clicked reply so a bunch of other people must&#039;ve done the same thing at the same time. I was just trying to help bump the posts up so someone could win.
