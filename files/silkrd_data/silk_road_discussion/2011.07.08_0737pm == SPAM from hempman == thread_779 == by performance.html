				Me too. How hard is it to do this? I checked out his website and found out it was all fake hemp. If I was making a movie and needed something to look real, I could see a need.But, I wondered when we would start to get spammed...<br /><br />But Fake? Just like someone to start selling lookalike pharmaceuticals. Think it will do well? lol...What a joke..

				Yeah I got it too, and started a thread in &#039;Rumour Mill&#039;<br /><br />Synthetic hash eh, what the fuck?<br /><br />The URL when sending a PM contains user number, not user name.<br /><br />So I suppose you&#039;d write a script to go to URL with user number 1 (paste &gt; send) then URL with user number 2 (paste &gt; send) ... user number 25000 (paste &gt; send)<br /><br /><br />disclaimer: I know nothing at all about scripting and spamming, but that&#039;ll be how it&#039;s done I suppose.<br /><br />Fix it by adding one of those same &#039;type the letters you see in this picture&#039; things when sending PMs, like we have to do when logging in?

				Yeah, let&#039;s ban spammers. No warning, no second chances. <br /><br />On a related note, what do you guys think about sellers sending messages to previous buyers notifying about new products? GreenCo has new strains up and is adding 2 more later this week. They know some customers would like to try the new stuff but they are afraid of being too spammy. I infrequent mellow advertising ok or should they avoid it?

				I think mellow advertising will be OK.&nbsp; It will allow us customers to know what is going to be available in a convenient way. Personally, something will fall on my spammy list if I received PMs from a seller that I never ordered from or the frequency of sent&nbsp; messages where high. Something like once a week or every 2 weeks is reasonable.
