				Okay so I ordered 50g MDMA from a vendor in Europe and apparently the package gets handled by DHL (a company similar to UPS or FedEx) once it is in the US.&nbsp; The vendor gave me a cross-reference (like tracking) number so that I can check it on DHL&#039;s website.&nbsp; It looked like it was stuck in Cincinatti, OH for a bit but then today they added an update that says &quot;Please Contact DHL&quot;... and this is stressing me out a bit.&nbsp; Has anyone else ever received this sort of update / status for their package?&nbsp; Naturally I don&#039;t feel much like contacting them LOL.<br /><br />Here is what the total tracking info says, with specifics redacted:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All info removed by danconia<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				You might want to remove some more of that info, like the city where the package is sitting and the origin country. There can&#039;t be too many packages in that facility from that country, potentially seized.<br /><br />Edit: Just delete the whole thing, it&#039;s unnecessary for your question.

				You guys are right, perhaps it was short-sighted to post that much info.&nbsp; It&#039;s up to me to decide how much risk I want to take but I suppose that info also puts the vendor at risk.<br /><br />To update on the issue, I got a card today from USPS (United States Postal Service) saying that they needed my signature for a delivery and I was unavailable. I took it to my (USPS) delivery guy and asked him about it and he explained it. I signed for the package and they will deliver it tomorrow.<br /><br />The &quot;Please contact DHL&quot; really made me nervous, and I am kinda confused as to why USPS gives me the notification card rather than DHL... but then again I don&#039;t know the inner-workings of the USPS. It actually looks like it is on track to be delivered, without any problems, tomorrow. <br /><br />At this point I believe everything will go as planned.

				Thank you for removing that :)<br /><br />Just my opinion here, but I would be leery as to the involvement of USPS when it was coming from DHL. I know it is common practice for Fedex, UPS, and DHL to work with USPS in handling residential deliveries, especially from overseas. It is much more efficient for them to hand it over to USPS as they already go door to door, rather than go off route for the delivery. It&#039;s just that controlled delivery takes place via USPS, correct. I don&#039;t think they use a private company(UPS, Fedex, DHL) for that. USPS takes custody of the package and then the Postal Inspectors collaborate along with LE for the delivery. I do also believe this takes some length of investigation before it can happen so if this is a one time deal I wouldn&#039;t worry.&nbsp; If it has been a thing of habit I might be slightly concerned.&nbsp; Since you already signed for it&nbsp; whatever is going to take place is inevitable now. Hopefully it is a smooth delivery as I can&#039;t see them getting your signature and then waiting to make a move. <br /><br />Like I said, this is just my opinion and some of the info used to form it may be incorrect as I&#039;ve never experienced first hand a CD. I&#039;m not trying to scare you and I&#039;m sorry if it comes across that way. I would love to hear from anyone else familiar with this as I really hope this works out for you. The more information we can gather for you the safer you will be. As long as you feel good about it though I say go for it. You know more about the circumstances than anyone. Good luck and please keep us updated.

				The good thing is that I know my mailman well and talked to him briefly and nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary.&nbsp; Things are too short notice IMHO for it to be a setup, plus I already signed so if they wanted to nab me they&#039;d have to kick down my door or something (and most importantly they wouldn&#039;t know whether I was home or not), or wait all day for me to pick up my mail.&nbsp; At this point I&#039;m not too worried about it, especially after hearing that DHL sometimes passes things off to USPS.<br /><br />Again sorry to all for posting too much info, that was dumb on my part.&nbsp; And to those of you saying 50g of MDMA is too much to be importing... you must be new here ;)

				yeah DHL, UPS and FedEx do hand off a lot of overseas packages to the USPS. in fact pretty much all of my overseas orders are delivered by the USPS (legal, legit things from ebay and such) <br /><br />like you said, i wouldnt worry too much about it from hearing the rest of the situation. <br /><br />good luck

				I second PinkKush&#039;s comment!&nbsp; In fact, I believe I know which vendor you are using.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never signed anything from this vendor, but my pack was much smaller and didn&#039;t involve tracking.&nbsp; I think most international packages with tracking require a signature and DHL indeed works with USPS on a regular basis.&nbsp; No worries!&nbsp; You prolly coulda picked it up yourself if you were feeling ballsy, but prolly best to let it be dropped.&nbsp; Stay safe!

				Buy a cheap pay as you go phone and phone them, to see what they want...<br /><br />It could be something totally irrelevant from what you think.. and if they had found your drugs, they probably would not tell you to contact them for a little chat. <br /><br />You are worrying over necessarily.<br /><br />But, delete this thread.

				Sure, these private couriers don&#039;t need a search warrant to rifle through your shit, but they are a business. Pissing their customers off is probably something that is exactly LAST on their priority list.<br /><br />When I was doing less illicit things, I still ordered at lot of things from other countries. I understand that some of the Soviet fallout states aren&#039;t held in the highest esteem, but one 100% legal parcel of mine was ripped open by USPS customs.&nbsp; I contacted them (in mega menstrual mode) and ripped them a new asshole.&nbsp; I have no doubt that my complaint resonated. Even the federal postal employees are held accountable for rookie moves.&nbsp; This caution to search packs is probably doubled by the private shipping couriers.&nbsp; They will flag a pack with 2keys of cocaine spilling out the sides, but they really can&#039;t afford to go out of their way to fuck you over.

				And considering that you guys went through DHL.... I&#039;m just going to assume that it was an express service.&nbsp; One of the worst things I think you could do is sit on things and not take any action when they are trying to deliver to you. Businesses order DHL to get shit to them very quickly.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bad idea to drag things out before picking your parcel up whether or not it is handed off to USPS (this is common if you aren&#039;t around a big postal system or larger city).<br /><br />Breathe easy. Chill out. Pick up yo pack.

				Well no special package in the mail Friday or today.&nbsp; It looks like the parcel I signed for was just for a letter regarding my health insurance (notifying me that my health insurance policy has expired since I left my old job).&nbsp; DHL tracking has no update since Thursday&#039;s &quot;please contact&quot;.&nbsp; I am not familiar with what kind of inspections this package may have gone through but I am tempted to call DHL<br /><br />The vendor has been very responsive to my messages and is confident about his / her stealth.<br /><br />I think I will call from someone else&#039;s phone and just say I am expecting some melatonin or some other harmless powder from Europe.&nbsp; I probably won&#039;t volunteer any more information than what they ask for.&nbsp; Any other tips I should know before calling them?

				Might not be a good idea to mention any medicines or pharmaceuticals Or even that you were expecting a package.<br /><br />Just tell them that their is a package awaiting your collection. If asked then don&#039;t tell them that you were expecting anything, but of course if it has your name &amp; address on it that you&#039;ll take it.<br /><br />edit: Just read your original post again and see that it was the tracking page you were asked to call. If you call then be careful as this would imply that you are expecting the package.<br />Just wait and see if it comes would be safest I think. <br />If DHL want to contact you or deliver it to you or put a card through then they have your address to do this. Tracking is just an added feature for you. Some people might not have internet to check.<br /><br />Sorry can&#039;t be any more help but see if there is any more advise from US people here.

				Maybe call them from a cabin? Then if they say you contacted them, you can always use plausible deniability. Would someone agree? <br /><br />Also, we had a couple of packages filled with about 100,000 to 200,000 doses worth of NBOMe stuck at DHL. They told us to contact them, and turned out it was because we couldn&#039;t ship to P.O. Boxes. Did you rent a Box to import your stuff, DHL can&#039;t deliver there. In the end, we went to DHL and they gave us our packages. Yes, it does stress you a bit but I guess it&#039;s alright. <br /><br />As I said, if people agree with me that plausible deniability could be used if you call them through a phone cabin, you should try that to at least know why they want you to contact them. It may be something like the address is wrong, or any other little error that may have happened.<br /><br />EDIT: We operate in Canada though, not the US, but I figured it would be more of the same

				I believe it was international post since it came from outside the US and then DHL was handling it once it was inside the US.&nbsp; As for a &quot;phone cabin&quot;, which I assume is what we call in the US a &quot;phone booth&quot;... I think that is probably the best way to call them.<br /><br />I will probably call tonight or tomorrow.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even know where the closest phone booth is hahahaha but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s one close around.

				Edit: For the record I only got the tracking number from the vendor, so without a latter from customs it would technically be suspicious for me to have knowledge about the package&#039;s status without ever receiving a tracking number nor a notice from customs.&nbsp; Maybe it takes a couple of business days for customs to send the notice?<br /><br />Yeah I won&#039;t lie it *is* tempting to call but at this point I&#039;m thinking it probably isn&#039;t worth it.&nbsp; This vendor&#039;s ratings are very good so it seems likely that this was just that unlucky random time customs caught one.<br /><br />One thing I don&#039;t understand is why DHL would tell me to call *their* customs department, rather than call the US Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) customs department or something.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the specifics of what the relationship is like between DHL and ICE.&nbsp; DHL has a &quot;live chat&quot; option on their website but I have doubts as to whether it would be able to reach their customs department.&nbsp; Maybe trying to contact them with a public library computer could help to anonymize me (I could even say I was the vendor, possibly?) but I still feel like contacting them is a risk regardless of which way I do it.<br /><br />I am going to message the vendor and see if it&#039;s possible to get a 50% refund or something.&nbsp; He has access to the cross-reference number which still shows the package as stuck at one of the distribution centers.&nbsp; Vendor&#039;s profile page says they don&#039;t typically re-send but may offer a 50% refund.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m curious if anyone knows if this ordeal means my name &amp; address might be flagged for future packages coming into the US?&nbsp; I suppose it&#039;d be impossible for them to enter the name / address of all intended recipients of international mail since probably hundreds of thousands or millions of parcels come through customs every day.&nbsp; If there is a strong possibility that they do then I might have to start ordering domestic or wait until I move / change addresses.<br /><br />Whatever happens, I may have to get creative to make sure my supply chain isn&#039;t broken for too long or I&#039;ll lose some of my customers.&nbsp; If there&#039;s anyone out there with customs / delivery experience any advice would be helpful at this point... I need to make sure I&#039;m armed with some solid wisdom to protect myself as much as possible.<br /><br />PS Still no letter from US Customs yet, is this typical?&nbsp; The lady at DHL definitely said I had to call the customs department to get more info (I don&#039;t know if she was referring to a DHL internal dept or Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement but I suppose I could Google the phone number she gave me).&nbsp; Thank you for those of you who have already put in their .02.&nbsp; I may call in pretending to be the sender or see if I can get the vendor to do that.&nbsp; Will update when there is something to update on.

				Before OP tries to pursue this package, let me offer an argument as to why he shouldn&#039;t.<br /><br />Here are the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for drugs:<br /><br />(I usually find a CLEARNET WARNING to be superfluous, but in this case, I will remind you to ONLY access this link over Tor)<br />http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2012_guidelines/Manual_HTML/2d1_1.htm<br /><br />The way it works is, for drugs not explicitly listed at the beginning, they are converted to a &quot;marihuana equivalent&quot; (btw, do you like the antiquated spelling of marijuana? these laws are old).<br /><br />So, we see this:<br /><br />1 gm of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine/MDMA = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500 gm of marihuana<br /><br />Thus 50 grams = 25 kg of MJ.<br /><br />It&#039;s the equivalent of getting busted with 55 lbs of pot.<br /><br />&quot;At least 20 KG but less than 40 KG of Marihuana&quot; puts you at a base offense level of 18. If you signed a plea agreement avoiding a trial, your offense level would lower be 3 to 15 (this is covered in Section 3E1.1, Acceptance of Responsibility).<br /><br />With no criminal history, you would be in Criminal History Category I (Section 4A1.1).<br /><br />Armed with this information, we go to the sentencing table in Section 5A.<br />http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2012_guidelines/Manual_HTML/5a_SenTab.htm<br /><br />Category I, Level 15 carries a recommended sentence of 18 to 24 months in prison. Most likely you would get the low end of that.<br /><br />So, unless you&#039;re ready to spend 18 months in prison, don&#039;t try to pick up the package.<br />

				After much thought I believe I will not be making any attempt to pursue this package.&nbsp; I have talked with the vendor and we have agreed on a 50% refund.&nbsp; At this point it doesn&#039;t seem like anyone is specifically at fault and we all know the risks that come with buying / selling on SR.<br /><br />I have made sure that the last several batches I ordered were diversified enough such that no single vendor or batch going wrong could screw me over financially.&nbsp; I am definitely glad I have taken that precaution and would recommend anyone else here who deals does the same thing.&nbsp; At this point if the package comes at my door I don&#039;t think I&#039;d sign for it and am considering the package gone.<br /><br />Again I can&#039;t stress enough that the vendor has been very accommodating and fair.&nbsp; Thanks a ton for your guys&#039; advice, it has helped give me some direction with this issue.

				For the record I have no intention of saying who the vendor was.&nbsp; Many good vendors are having issues lately with MDMA packages reaching the USA.<br /><br />I still have not received the package nor do I expect to.&nbsp; When I called DHL&#039;s customer service (more than a week ago) they told me I&#039;d have to call their customs department.&nbsp; I have no intention of doing so.&nbsp; The vendor gave me 50% refund in accordance with their advertised policy.<br /><br />I will be ordering from vendors who ship from countries whose packages are less-scrutinized by US customs from here on out.&nbsp; Peace of mind and quicker delivery should make it worth the extra price.

				Maybe it&#039;s somthing you don&#039;t have to worry about.<br /><br />DHL is not L.E.<br /><br />If you think it&#039;s smelly and do not trust it after, you can say you never ordered anything.<br />Could be something completely harmless.<br />I would give it a shot and call to ask what the problem is.<br /><br />Would be a waste to let it go for no reason.<br />I would like to know that reason.<br /><br />Not reacting might be even more suspicious.

				Good to hear. I think you handled this the right way. No matter what loss may have incurred by not chasing the package you still have your freedom. That in the end is worth more than any of the other shit. Stay safe and thanks for sharing the experience.
