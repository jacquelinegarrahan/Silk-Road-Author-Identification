				So I messaged a couple of vendors via pgp, encrypted everything correctly and was talking of placing orders with both of them and neither of them responded.&nbsp; All my questions were product related. Could they just be really busy? Paranoid? I didn&#039;t think I sounded stupid. lol.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m admittedly new here, but someone&#039;s got to work with me. I just don&#039;t wanna waste my time getting burned or someone trying to scam me. Regardless of the use of escrow I just figured I&#039;d message some more reputable vendors I&#039;ve seen mentioned on the forums that sell what I&#039;m looking for.<br /><br />I like to be safe and thoroughly informed. That&#039;s the road anyone would take, right? If they don&#039;t respond I don&#039;t suppose it&#039;d be wise to place an order anyway? Fuck it. I mean. I really wanted to stick with the two that I found because they seem pretty legit and good to do buisness with, but I guess I&#039;ll just keep trying? I just wanna eat some good mushrooms and have a nice trip. Hopefully I&#039;ll get someone who wants to actually do buisness?

				Your first mistake was messaging vendors encrypted right off the bat. Most of us don&#039;t have the time to decrypt anything but sensitive information. A quick hello and inquiry I don&#039;t think counts.&nbsp; :P

				Frylexa is right. Encryption is only for sensitive information. If you haven&#039;t told anything about yourself or such then there shouldn&#039;t be reason to use encryption. If you sent your (encrypted) question to some more known and reputable vendor, it probably takes time as well since they get most messages, and those without encryption pass faster naturally. No one here is not going to be without clients. Though its possible you get your answer bit later, but that&#039;s slow business for both parties. ::)

				Agree, the reason you&#039;re not getting replies is because you&#039;re using PGP off the bat. Vendors are too busy for that (unfortunately for safety conscious buyers like you). Maybe a better strategy is to message them unencrypted, without revelating anything that makes you uncomfortable, and ask them if they would mind if you communicated by PGP for things you&#039;d rather not discuss without encryption.

				Oh my god. Lol. I guess I&#039;m acting like this is some icognito james bond shit and their probably reading the message like &quot;Wtf -.-&quot;. Thanks so much for the responses. I feel silly as hell, but better safe than sorry I thought you know? I just thought that&#039;s how they wanted it, but seriously? Not everything has to be encrypted? Alrighty. lol.

				you&#039;re messaging people who have open adverts for illegal drugs that anyone can see. i wouldn&#039;t worry too much about encrypting your message about buying from them, its pretty irrelevant information after the fact, considering the open drug advertisements.

				You shouldn&#039;t feel silly, although what everyone else says is true. All over the forums is &#039;use PGP use PGP&#039; and you&#039;ve obviously taken the time to educate yourself before diving in. And some vendors will like ALL coms encrypted. But yes most messages can be sent plaintext unless otherwise instructed. A good tip is to put your actual question in the subject line of a message, if its a simple one. This makes it easier for them as they can read it straight off. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you like the sound of those vendors try again with unencrypted. Read their vendor page carefully to check your question isn&#039;t answered. There usually isn&#039;t a huge amount to talk about, but when you&#039;re new the urge to say hi is understandable. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DO encrypt your address when you make your order though, obviously. Enjoy your trip!
