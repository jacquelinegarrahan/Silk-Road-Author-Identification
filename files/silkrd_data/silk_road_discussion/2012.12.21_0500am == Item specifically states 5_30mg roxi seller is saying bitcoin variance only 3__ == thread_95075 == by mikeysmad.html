				Hi i have made my first trans on here last week all went smooth and now I decided since it worked i would purchase more I found an add stating 5/30mg roxis and purchased now the seller is saying because of the bitcoin variance going down and the price only popping up as 98 dollars that i am only getting 3 roxis I do not agree with this an told him her could just refund my money and I have had no response I am just wondering what am I supposed to do if this transaction does not work out and he does not refund my money and still only sends me three???

				I don&#039;t know a lot about the fluctuations on the site, but I thought the prices periodically adjusted themselves when the value of bitcoins changed?<br /><br />For example, when I look at the marketplace all of the prices are in USD. Makes it easier for this mama. Right now BTC is what... 1 = $13.50? When I placed an order for some bud, the bud was roughly $70 with BTC at $12 per coin.. The USD price of the item I bought now is still showing $70usd for the item, it just means I would purchase it with less bitcoins this time because the value of them is higher.<br /><br />This sounds very fishy to me.<br /><br />- OPM 8)<br /><br />edit - If this doesn&#039;t make any sense to you, I apologize.

There is no difference what the value of bitcoins is today you still paid $70.

				Right. I got that. So what I&#039;m saying is shouldn&#039;t the OP receive what he purchased because the item listed should&#039;ve been valued correctly even if the BTC fluctuated? Or no?

The vendor should of hedged his listings so that they were tied into dollar amounts and not bitcoin amounts. He cannot change the quantity and if he sends you less then you should take the transaction to the resolution center. I am sure SR would agree that if the listing states a certain amount that amount is what is owed.

				You are dealing with a shitty vendor. Your question is what to do now. Hopefully he will cancel your order. As you did ask him too. If he does not and he sends you 3 I would suggest you file a complaint and hopefully resolution will do the right thing. Actually I hope the vendor does the right thing and sends you the 5 you ordered. As it is his fault.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand is how he is explaining this as the BTC has not changes that much and in fact has gone up not down. Also it is important that you choose a vendor based on there feedback and not the lowest price. Almost all the good vendors are the same price for the drug you are talking about. Within a couple dollars. And all of the top USA Rx vendors are actually really good so I assume you chose a new vendor.<br /><br />Could you tell us who this vendor is? That way people will know to stay away from this shit bag.<br /><br />Good luck OP.

				you ordered 5 fot x btc. He have to send 5. When sending 3 ( lucky you have already proof from the message) he is wrong and res center will certainly agree with you.<br />He is right that the prices change, It can be in -sometimes extreme situations- that it is pretty much.<br />That is why you need to peg your prices to the dollar. <br />He made a listing for say 10 btc = 120 dollar<br />Now a little later he sells it for 10 btc to you but....now for him for the 10 btc is not 120 dollar but 110, 100 or even 90. Of course for him it also can be 10btc is 125, 130 etc.<br />So, again, the vendor should ( I think) peg the prices. That way you always pay the same dollar price although the btc is changing.<br />At the moment you change your $ for btc you get x but that does not matter because the price you pay will be at that time the same as what you got changing.<br />Of course there will always be a difference but in this case it will be acceptable.<br />I use this now for a long time and it is working very well.<br />Only problem...people looking at my listing see the price, say 10 btc., a week later they look again and now it is 11 btc. (usually not that extreme, its an example)<br />Sometimes they accuse me of raising the price to get more money, the opposite is true, there is no more honest system.<br />So, you can explain this system to that vendor <br />When now he is losing when changing to dollar he can decide to wait for better time or peg it...<br />As a thank you for the good advice he will send you the 5 as ordered and, if he is smart a little bonus :-)<br />
