				ughh you kids and your &quot;moonrocks&quot; or whatever. MDMA is MDMA. Powder, Crystal, larger chunks of crystal...it&#039;s all the same. I can&#039;t count how many shows I&#039;ve been to where kids are coming up to me asking me to buy &quot;molly&quot; and when I ask how much they tell me it&#039;s more expensive because IT&#039;S MOONROCK DUUUUUUUDE<br /><br /><br />I never really stuck to domestic vendors for MDMA because it&#039;s too expensive. if you had more time I&#039;d say go for dutch or cloudsurfer. My first MDMA i bought from PeoplesDrugStore and that was nice but since then they&#039;ve been kinda sketchy and stuff. <br /><br />good luck and please realize that just because there are larger chunks of crystal doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s better. MDMA can easily be recrystallized and the potency would diminish greatly. <br />

				We have a MDMA listing. I&#039;ve eaten it myself and it&#039;s as good as anything around. Supertrips MDMA is the absolute best I&#039;ve ever eaten. I have a few of his 120mg pills laying around if you&#039;d like some I&#039;d make you a custom listing. 1.5 and you&#039;d be rolling as hard as anyone at the rave. I also have some &#039;moonrocks&#039; if you&#039;d like that.

				i highly recommend anseladams, his prices are cheap, his stealth is good, and shipping is quick, and the quality is fucking amazing. his stuff is purple moon rock, some of the nicest i have seen in the past year, from both on and off the road. just to be clear though, i haven&#039;t tried any other domestic vendors. i have a gram from cousin frank, but it has not been tried or tasted yet. <br />here is a link to anseladams&#039; gram of MDMA http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/23bcc017f5 :)

				i would go with that listing for sure honestly... based on anon being an experienced guy&nbsp; :) the price is BOMB and purple xtals would be amazing to have. (cant lie that would be a selling point id use to others, because it sounds so fucking cool lol) in all seriousness, that is a GREAT price for domestic mdma. im honestly glad i found it because im thinking next time i load up some btc, im going to make an order from him. thanks anon =D

				Not sure how MDMA is purple without being &quot;re-rocked&quot; but I have not tried it so cannot say.....<br /><br />&quot;10toes&quot; has/had some pretty nice tan powder molly, was a little underweight but reagent tests were all good<br /><br />&quot;headmeds&quot; has/had some killer MDMA shards, overweight, spot on reagent tests<br /><br />Am always looking for other good US sellers though cause no one seems to stay stocked lol<br /><br />I think I am going to try &quot;UndergroundSyndicate&quot; next time...... anyone have feedback on UGS stash???<br /><br />......moonstones, moonrocks, fucking whatever is just slang...... it&#039;s no different than calling it molly vs. MDMA...... <br /><br />

				AT $60 a gram, anseladams is the cheapest domestic seller. Like anonman said, he&#039;s got a top notch product, certainly as good as any other domestic seller.

				(USA) domestic MDMA is over.fucking.priced. I mostly stick with domestic though cause the waiting game kills me with international!!!!<br /><br />......plus if it gets seized at the border your out of luck...... but most vendors know what theyy are doing or they would not have made it this far.....<br /><br />Canada is a pretty safe bet...... quick to US, much better prices..... wish &quot;dopeboy&quot; was still around...... I was one of the lucky ones who actually got some molly from &quot;tony76&quot; before he fucked everyone over..... the price was right, the quality was average at best..... not that any of that matters anymore..... Have not tried any Canadian vendors lately. <br /><br />If you really want to branch out (of the US) &quot;Ivory&quot; will never let you down..... always good shit, never had a problem with him and quick shippin g to US. Although he does not have the &quot;moonstones&quot; you speak of......
