				SR is coming back, I can quite literally feel it. <br /><br />I have Drug Extra Sensory Perception. I can hold a sealed package of drugs in my hand and tell whether or not it&#039;s strong. If I am asleep when a really strong package is sent my way, I can see it being dropped into a really beautiful box in my dream.&nbsp; <br /><br />I took a nap earlier and had a dream that a handful of men were working harder than they ever have. I saw DPR. I refuse to say what the Entity (I refuse to say whether or not DPR is male or Female, alien or human) looks like, other than tired the fuck out. I channeled DPR as much energy as I could when I awoke from my nap. I felt DPR shake my hand in thanks for the energy.<br /><br /><br /><br />BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE HAVE NOT AWAKENED FROM THIS DREAM JUST YET!

				If SR comes back before midnight, I think this thread is going to get crazy. :p Some people might start calling you prophet.<br /><br /><br />Or they might accuse you of being LE or something. You never know with these people.

				Hey gang,<br /><br />We&#039;re still getting things set up.&nbsp; Nothing new to report.&nbsp; Obviously I can&#039;t say much, but we are redeploying the entire system and it is taking lots of time to get all of the data properly backed up and where it needs to be, not to mention thoroughly testing the changes we are making to the system that will hopefully give us enough head room to grow multiple times again.<br /><br />I&#039;m fully aware that Silk Road isn&#039;t your only choice and that my reputation is on the line right now.&nbsp; We are working on all of these issues in parallel and will be slamming the caffeine until we are up and stable.<br /><br />Your next update will come no later than 5 am EST.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />DPR<br /><br />PS - I hear everyone&#039;s hopes and fears.&nbsp; This is a stressful time for some of us.&nbsp; I&#039;m taking this opportunity to find a calm center as the situation whirls around me and I keep pressing forward, calm and clear.&nbsp; This won&#039;t be the most challenging situation I&#039;ll face I am sure and it is good practice.&nbsp; Good luck to each of you as you get through this with me :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Reply<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Notify<br /><br />
