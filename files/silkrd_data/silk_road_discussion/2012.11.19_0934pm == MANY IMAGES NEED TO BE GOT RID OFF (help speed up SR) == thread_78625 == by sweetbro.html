				I know this might have been said a&nbsp; million times before but whenever i mention it falls on deaf ears.<br /><br />when we finally log into silk road we are loaded with a selection of random listings with huge thumbnails showing powders, pictures of rabbits or idiots like bradd pitt. The majority of these images have nothing to do with the product at hand.<br /><br />take them off and turn the website&#039;s main page into a text listing with subheadings instead of this insane bunny rabbit thumbnail bonanza!<br /><br />they serve no purpose and only slow the website down.<br /><br /><br />also, all vendor pages should have low quality downsized images of the drugs they offer that you can click on if you want to have a bigger high resolution look.<br /><br /><br /><br />rreeemeber - you take the images off the main page and cut back on the images and you increase the capacity load 100 fold!!!<br /><br /><br />please do it DPR... please!!!

				Actually, when I&#039;m bored I like to refresh the main page and scope out new products I&#039;d like to invest in. Isn&#039;t there an option to turn off images on SR, anyway? I don&#039;t think this is what you&#039;re asking for, but it&#039;s the closest you&#039;ll get to what you want.

				ignocnito browsing will not solve this problem unless the everybody uses it.<br /><br />everybody should be ingonito browsing by default or a combination of the both. the main page should have no images of bunny rabbits- it should be an out-generated but no images. <br /><br />images waste sever bandwidth. every website designer knows this<br /><br /><br />i remeber when DPR changed his login page to an image and how it did nothing but slow down the page? well he should have left it as text and centered the login box and that would have been better andf pretty much looked the same.<br /><br /><br />me changing to ingonito broswing wont help thousands of other people have a faster experince&nbsp; unless everybody changes to incognito&nbsp; broswing.<br /><br /><br />DPR you are gonna save bucketloads of hassle/money/investment if you ditch the images buddy!!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Sweetbro,<br /><br />I really doubt bandwidth is SRs bottle neck. Remember the guys who started youtube managed to start that from their garage.

				I havent had any issues with the site loading in the past few days. I think there was just a big push and everyone hammered the SR. It should have just been left down till it was 100% ready. I guess if they did that though then the few people that could get into it wouldnt have been able to do their transactions..
