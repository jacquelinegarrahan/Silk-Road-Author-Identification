				Does anyone else feel really lucky?&nbsp; We have solved the problem of government control and manipulation of money, the difficulty of getting drugs, the difficulty of selling drugs to feed our families and make pocket money.&nbsp; I feel lucky to be a part of this community.&nbsp; 99 out of 100 people that I deal with are honest and easy to work with.&nbsp; What more could we all want?

				+1!<br /><br />Thanks for posting this. I don&#039;t think we all truly appreciate just what we have here. I remarked to one of my friends that we are truly experiencing a glimpse of the future and we are like the lucky beta testers.<br /><br />I mean can you imagine? A place where we can go online to freely talk about any drug or taboo topic with like minded individuals, all helping each other achieve something they have in common. Some of the vendors on here are absolutely incredible. They truly care about their clients and want to spread love, an honorable thing to do. Many vendors I speak with hardly even take profits, their mission is genuinely to make people happy because that&#039;s what makes them happy.<br /><br />We&#039;re truly in an incredible place and realize that our individual actions reflect this entire community, which is why even though there are trolls and scammers galore, the spirit of the Silk Road community always manages to push past them to make this the success that it is.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone who has made this possible, its a huge effort when you think of everything that goes into it. I&#039;m honestly humbled that I am allowed to use such a service and I plan to treat it with the same respect it has treated me.<br /><br />Love to all,<br />HEATFan

				I love this thread! I love that we have SR I just hate how the idea is viewed. I mean really governments of the world, instead of legalizing and regulating drugs and making money/decreasing deaths/crime, you are treating us like a breed of human that is so crude and horrible. Shame on you society for making us resort to a &quot;underground&quot; this is ridiculous. How are we any different than our founding fathers who HAD to break the law to form this nation. WE are the new wave. WE are the people that will look back in 50 years and say &quot;I can remember when that was illegal back in my day, but you know what I didn&#039;t give 1 fuck!&quot; I am glad to be part of that!

				Well said all three of you! What happens here is the highlight of my day when I get on. Even browsing the forums and reading real articles and product reviews by real people is so cool. We&#039;re a neat bunch, I hope this good thing never ends.&nbsp; :)

				In all honesty, SR is my single biggest source of hope for my life, society, and the future. It consists of people I can understand...people who fucking understand me...people who have made my dream come true. My life has literally changed for the better without a doubt.

				SR prompts three reactions from me on a regular basis:<br /><br />1) awe. Like, holy shit, look what I just ordered to my door. <br /><br />2) gratitude. That&#039;s the &quot;I am so lucky&quot; feeling. :)<br /><br />3) anger. The injustice of the WOD hit me one day when, in close proximity, I&#039;d stopped taking prescription meds for depression, had some tasty cannabis strains delivered from the Road, and was out purchasing some microbrews. I look at the beer in my hand and think: &quot;What the fuck? There is NO difference to any of this. It&#039;s all fucking arbitrary.&quot; <br /><br />And I don&#039;t think I ever really had a sense of that until I got to play with this stuff without fear. I completely realize I&#039;d hit another, much deeper, level of anger if I personally experienced some jail time - me or someone I know - for something one of us decides, as a responsible adult, to experiment with. But those three are irrevocably connected for me now: awe, gratitude, and anger, whenever I stop to think about any of this.

				Every day I come on here I feel lucky. It&#039;s so great that I can get quality, peer reviewed drugs at fair prices from people who actually seem to care about their customers. I know there will always be scammers and people selling shitty product, just like in real life, but on here I find it easier to select a source that is legit. I am no long afraid to share things with my friends before always trying them first, because we&#039;ve got such a great community of people I trust to be reviewers as well. I am thankful for this website and the people make it as great as it is.
