				AAAAAAAPPPPPPEEEEEESHHHHHHIIIIIIIIT!!!<br /><br />That&#039;s what the BC market has gone and done right now.<br /><br />All the sellers getting back from the bar tonight realising that they&#039;re offering deals that has the buyers wetting their pants in excitement (well... at least in the context of SR at least).&nbsp; I foresee a short period of sellers ramping down there offers (are they even allowed to do that?&nbsp; Not being a seller I&#039;m not sure what they&#039;re allowed to do or not do with their open offers).&nbsp; I also predict some sellers may back out of deals due to the current plummeting of the market)<br /><br />As I write this the BC value stands at at about 3.&nbsp; &nbsp; No that is not a typo!!!<br /><br /><br />Just look at the chart : <br /><br />ht tp :// bitcoin charts&nbsp; &nbsp;.com<br /><br />Looking at block explorer&nbsp; (htt p s:/ /block explore&nbsp; r.c&nbsp; om/) it&#039;s pretty simple to figure out that some individual as offloaded a shedload of BC (approx worth Â£300,000) in one go.&nbsp; They biggest one time sell off since at least April (charts don&#039;t go back that far)<br /><br />On a side note, I&#039;m not sure why they even bothered splitting off their trove into multiple BC transactions (mostly a bunch of 50BC txs and quite a few 2000BC txs).&nbsp; Then funneled into the same exit tx.&nbsp; A useless exercise (probably carried out by a simple script - and just as easily analysed by another).&nbsp; Or is it??&nbsp; I dunno... still on the fence about this.&nbsp; After all I suppose there might be something to say for leaving a convoluted trail. <br /><br />Anyway... this is all interesting stuff an &#039;economic&#039; point of view.<br /><br />and.... 3 cheers for the guy.&nbsp; We all hate him for blasting the market but secretly we all wanna be him.... LOL<br /><br /><br />Well.. here&#039;s my take on what to do now.<br /><br />Firstly...DON&#039;T PANIC!!!!&nbsp; I can&#039;t say that stongly enough dudes.&nbsp; FFS hold on to your BCs (remember the golden rule.... never sell when the market is low).&nbsp; I see this as an opportunity and have just purchased a bunch at about 3 so I&#039;mm well happy (not massive amount... about $200 worth... not giving details or I&#039;ll be chain hunted.... LOL).&nbsp; And don&#039;t forget the other golden rule... do not shove anything into the market that you&#039;re not prepared to lose.<br /><br />The only way I can see the market being destroyed is by governments attacking the exchanges.&nbsp; This may well happen.... but it certainly won&#039;t happen across the world simultaneously.&nbsp; There&#039;ll always be some rouge country willing to sell them.<br /><br />SR sellers : we all understand your pain at these currency fluctuations fucking with your sales.&nbsp; Please do not bail on your buyers.&nbsp; Just be smart and keep your BC offers in line with the &#039;normal&#039; such that it&#039;s a fair price (at least in SR terms anyway).&nbsp; Unfortunately right now this means watching the currency like a hawk.<br /><br /><br />now... back to my bong and a thought to those who died 10 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you think you&#039;ve got it tough.... think again.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				New SR user, here, and my first post :)<br /><br />I, myself cannot believe how much the BTC has decreased. I overall lost around $68 . (good thing i didnt buy too much BTC - and i thought i was getting a good price @ 7 at the time..)<br /><br />This could be because of the euro dropping dramatically.

				Everyone go out and buy BTC at this new low rate then buy lots of drugs - prices will go back up. Quickly smoke a bowl do your part to fix the BTC economy. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
