				Obviously the catpchas are effective, since his strategy has changed. Now he&#039;s posting inside of threads.<br /><br />Rather than just downvoting him, I suggest hitting that &quot;Report to moderator&quot; link and entering &quot;spam&quot;. This will help the mods find his posts.

				I&#039;d just like to know why he is doing it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it possible that people are buying into his scam enough to make it worth his/her time or is s/he just messing with us?&nbsp; Or something altogether different.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				The spammers are sending private messages now, too. There doesn&#039;t seem to be any way to report them or to block the sender, though.

That&#039;s the only reason spammers do what they do. As hard as it is to believe, in a large enough population, there will always be suckers who fall for the trap. Spam long enough and somebody will send you money. Just today somebody posted on the forum that they sent money to btkoin.co.uk and didn&#039;t get coins in return. Does that address sound familiar?
