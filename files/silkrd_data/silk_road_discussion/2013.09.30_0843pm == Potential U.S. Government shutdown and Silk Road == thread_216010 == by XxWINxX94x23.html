				In light of recent congressional activity, it is possible the United States government could shut down for a period of time. Many parts can lose funding and consequently be temporarily inactive, from what I understand.<br /><br />Here is the what the DEA has to say about it: CLEARNET<br />http://www.justice.gov/dea/resource-center/doing-business.shtml<br /><br />&quot;NOTICE TO ALL DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (DEA) CONTRACTORS POTENTIAL LAPSE OF APPROPRIATIONS<br /><br />Funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) under its current appropriations act expires on September 30, 2013.&nbsp; As of this date, no new appropriations act or continuing resolution has been passed.&nbsp; Unless such legislation is enacted before the end of FY2013, there will be no annual appropriations available to fund activities of the DEA for Fiscal Year 2014 (FY 2014) on October 1, 2013.<br /><br />The effect of a lapse of funding on a particular contract, order, and other procurement commitment (hereafter, Contract) is dependent on the source of funding and terms of the particular Contract and the activities the Contract supports.&nbsp; It is therefore not possible to provide comprehensive guidance covering all circumstances and situations.<br /><br />Contractors and their employees performing under contracts, purchase orders, or task/delivery orders will be reviewed by DEA Program personnel to determine if conditions are met for continuance of performance while under a government shutdown.&nbsp; <br /><br />Contracting Officers (COs) in the Office of Acquisition and Relocation Management will contact Contractor Companies directly regarding orders for which some or all of the contractor personnel have been deemed “non-excepted” and should not come to work at DEA starting on October 1, 2013.&nbsp; If a CO does not contact the Contractor Company directly with the names of contractor personnel who should not come to work at DEA, then all contractor personnel on that order are expected to report to work on October 1 at their normal reporting times and locations.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />So maybe there will be less LE for a short amount of time?<br /><br />Anyone have any intriguing opinions on how the gov&#039;t shutdown could affect the Silk Road?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />

				Doesn&#039;t seem like they&#039;re getting anywhere fully funded so I don&#039;t think we will notice too much except for one very important thing:<br /><br />Our numerous government customers will not get a paycheck from the many law abiding citizens who pay their taxes, and therefore our sales may drop.<br /><br />Fucking Republicans.<br /><br />Modzi

				Well the fucking USPS better the fuck work! WE are dependent on it, more ways then One ;-) But with Congress trying to kill it with the 75 year retirement fund bullshit...&nbsp; But I think they are almost operating with limited public funding, mostly for Rural areas that could never come close to breaking even.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But Yeah, here is to lost funding to the DEA!!!

				I hope the whole damned government shuts down and stays shut down.&nbsp; Except for USPS, of course.&nbsp; But let&#039;s be honest this is all just political theater and I doubt any critical services will shut down.&nbsp; Even if there are &quot;furlough days&quot; or whatever those employees will be back to work soon and will probably get paid for even for their days off.<br /><br />I suppose UPS and FedEx would be fine if there aren&#039;t any customs agents to check the mail =D

				The good news is that the USPS is self funded hence will remain in operation however the DEA is considered a critical component so will also remain fully operational during the period.<br /><br />Status quo

				I am not standing up for either of the two American political parties, however, the rationale behind the effort to de-fund the ACA or Obamacare is valid. Modzi, you are allegedly an attorney or were; do you agree with the SCOTUS&#039;s ruling, using an absurd severalty position, altering the legislation to comport with the Constitution? The healthcare law was defined as a tax.I have no love for the alphabet soup agencies or our bloated bureaucracy. Our country is 17 trillion in debt...Ponder the size of this figure...

DEA employees will still be working, even if they aren&#039;t paid.

Plus this will probably only last a few days to a few weeks at most.<br />
