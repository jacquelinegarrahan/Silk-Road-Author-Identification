				I&#039;ve been around since around May and I have seen many top vendors turn into scammers and just dissapear with loads of people&#039;s money.&nbsp; Can anybody help me to understand these vendors mindset?&nbsp; If I was in their position with the product and large customer base I would never turn scam, as you will make SO MUCH MORE MONEY in the long-run through continually providing service...&nbsp; I just don&#039;t understand it...&nbsp; Just my thoughts.

				Because of this:<br /><br />1.) Turn scammer, and make a bunch of money without mailing product.<br />2.) Disappear.<br />3.) Reappear as a &#039;new&#039; vendor, and fill in the vacuum in the market created by your own absence.<br /><br />And there are plenty of vendors on here who&#039;ve been around for a while, quietly going about their business and doing awesome work.<br /><br />

				Ah yes there are without a doubt some diamonds in the rough on the road (; and I will always bring my money + business to them as we can become rich together haha.&nbsp; There should be some sort of way to stop this though! It&#039;s rediculous, though it has taught me to be much more careful on the road (;

Greed can get to the best of vendors, but others remain loyal to both SR and their customers and stick to what is best for everyone. Being legit for a couple of months and then running away with the trust and money of buyers is an easy thing to do, staying legitimate until the end while providing the best customer service possible is much more challenging.

				Another main reason is I&#039;m sure they make their money and get out.&nbsp; You can only send so many thousands of packages through the mail before it starts being considered pressing your luck.&nbsp; I&#039;d guess many are honest for a while then go scammer mode and make a FUCKTON then sell in real life.&nbsp; You&#039;ll notice even the top tier vendors on the road(In terms of bulk) are still no where near the top.&nbsp; <br /><br />So imagine it like a weed dealer.&nbsp; You start off selling an oz by the gram but eventually you make enough that your selling the oz.&nbsp; Why do people want to ship 200 dollars of drugs halfway across the world at a certain point it probably becomes not worth the risk.&nbsp; Couple that with the fact they can basically scam for 2 whole months before they get &quot;caught&quot; and you can see why it becomes enticing.

				Because the repeat cycle for scamming is much more appealing then becoming too popular of a vendor that the police/feds start trying to hunt you down<br /><br />You go scam, cashout 100k and appear to be dead

				If you&#039;re a reputable buyer then never FE. But at the same time its very easy for a buyer to scam by saying they didn&#039;t receive any product and get refund because of there good buying stats.<br /><br />Scams will always exist here and there isn&#039;t much that can be put in place to prevent it.<br /><br />Dank

				The same reason a long-term buyer who, for whatever reason, decides he is never going to use SR again (or maybe not for a long time) would abuse the hell out of his 100% stats to get some freebie goodbye drugs.

				They do it because they can get away with it. When they rip people off, there is no one there to threaten them with violence/death etc.

				im new and i agree i been a member for about 2 months now going and i have dealt with some good vendors who keep their word.<br />but some like cocacowboy who claim to be real and then keep your money and never send any packages to you.,<br />i feel your pain if you have been on the other end of the scammed side.<br />and the worst is that some people protect these people by telling you to give them time and they are new.<br />2 weeks is past to way to much time to give to any vendor to come up with your product.<br />and ship priority. why have rules in place if the vendors do not follow them and get away with them.<br />like requiring people to fe because thier money is in escrow, its part of the business and at the end they will get the money<br />not like the person who fe and then gets nothing in return because they fe.<br />because of vendors great feedback.

				^ I think that is true, vendors don&#039;t want to get too big so they go out in the most profitable way possible for them.

				Selling drugs is not an easy career path, despite the misconceptions to the contrary.&nbsp; The same core principles that make or break a legitimate business venture apply to the drug trade too...&nbsp; Success won&#039;t come without a good business plan: hard work, long hours, a long term goal, and a strategy to get there.&nbsp; For those vendors, the ones thinking like DPR, scamming will not help achieve a favorable end game.&nbsp; For those vendors who come here looking for a quick and easy buck, scamming is de rigueur.<br /><br />Ironically, however, the most profitable scams are the ones that are the most complex...&nbsp; The ones that require an elaborate plan, hard work, long hours, a goal, and a strategy to achieve it.&nbsp; The longer you&#039;re in this game, the more likely it is that you&#039;ll get caught.&nbsp; Turn and burn, baby, turn and burn...&nbsp; Tony76 applied his craft masterfully- he maximized his profits in every way he could by pulling an elaborate, perfectly timed, multi-layered scam utilizing multiple income streams, and he set the whole thing up by working his ass off and employing a work ethic that was, for the time he employed it, second to none.&nbsp; It really was fucking brilliant...&nbsp; He sure as hell earned the hundred bucks he got from me.<br /><br />But none of this bullshit would even matter if buyers would simply use the escrow system.&nbsp; If everyone stayed within escrow, there would be no Tony76.

				My conjecture<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Source is cut off or supply is really low so they scam and try and make it last <br /><br />2. They get too many orders and can&#039;t handle the pressure and increased work and just say &quot;fuck it&quot;<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Repeat offenders who are motivated by greed(discussed earlier in the thread)

				Most vendors don&#039;t come in with the intention of scamming but eventually if they fall behind or make too many mistakes they would rather go out with some cash than none at all. It&#039;s not the vendors with the intention to scam we should worry about but rather the big vendors that are falling behind (some people even started speculating that I was going to bust a Tony like scam). Just pay attention to the community and report anything suspicious, if the vendor has no bad intentions then they will simply continue on as usual but if they do have bad intentions they&#039;ll either cave under pressure or run without causing too much damage.
