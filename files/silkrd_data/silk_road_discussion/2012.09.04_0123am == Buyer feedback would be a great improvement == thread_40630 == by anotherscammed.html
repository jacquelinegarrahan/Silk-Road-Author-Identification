				So much of the finalizing early controversy would be solved it buyers had feedback and not just stats.<br />I had a buyer who didn&#039;t receive his package because the usps didn&#039;t deliver it or he lied.<br /><br />To not mess up my feedback I cancelled the order as &quot;never arrived&quot;. The buyer gave me a 2/5 because it didn&#039;t arrive even though he received a full refund including shipping.<br /><br />This was a seller with 0/0 stats. I asked what I could have done better and I got no response.<br /><br />The situation is really not good that people can just keep coming back with 0/0 and they hurt vendors who are really doing their best.<br /><br />If buyers took pride in their feedbacks they would I think pull less shit.

				With a buyer who has 0/0, you really shouldn&#039;t be giving a full refund. Given the 2/5 he left you, that was clearly a scammer.<br /><br />Also, use DCNs. ALWAYS use DCNs. They&#039;re not perfect protection, but they will vastly reduce the number of lying cunts you have to deal with. :)

				I gave the full refund because I was afraid of getting a bad feedback. I really want it to be 100 and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to have that as long as buyers don&#039;t get feedback as well. They can hit us with no fear of retribution. They can blackmail us. Too many people are getting scammed on this site and there are improvements that need to be made and I think buyers getting rating with feedback would really help. The way it is all these 0/0 people can do what they want but I don&#039;t want to turn them down in case they&#039;re actually good people. If they finalize early, so what?, they can still mess up your feedbacks so I don&#039;t ask anyone to finalize and I take 0/0 customers and my feedbacks suffer and I shouldn&#039;t have that problem for giving people a chance.<br /><br />My alternative would be to cancel orders for people with less than 5 perfect transactions. Then my feedback would probably be better but I&#039;d be turning people off and missing out on potentially good customers. The setup here is conducive to scamming. Sellers who are trying to do the right get penalized. Even if I cancelled the orders of people with less than 5 perfect transactions, they get penalized with the fluctuating btc price. So they&#039;re pissed and then they can come and complain about you on the forums.<br /><br />As it is I refund a lot out of fear of bad feedbacks AND my feedbacks are less than they should be considering that I do 100 percent to make sure my customers are whole, whatever happens even if I take a loss on the deal<br /><br />If sellers had accountability because they were getting rated it would help. It would solve the 0/0 customers. I don&#039;t even see how finalizing early really helps with them. It only gives less incentive for them to claim nondelivery. I always do use DCNs. These problems I have are beyond the scope of that.
