				Go to blockexplorer.com and enter the BTC address that you sent the coins to. There are way more blocks created in a day to reach the 7 confirmations that will make the funds show up in your account.<br /><br />Also, from where did you send the coins? Directly from an exchange wallet, online wallet provider, bitcoin client on your computer?<br /><br />Hopefully you sent them to the correct address because if you not, then bye bye bitcoins&nbsp; &nbsp;:(

				I sent them to the correct address. Double checked and no way I could have stuffed it up. They were sent from bitcoin7, I think it might be their system playing up.

				Ouch, I also got burned by bitcoin7 this week to the tune of ~10BTC. Good thing I didn&#039;t deposit more as something must be going on with them if it&#039;s happening to others as well.

				looks like I&#039;m gonna have to just use someone on here to get bitcoin. The bitcoins seemed so easy to get ahold of when i first started learning about obtaining them. Looks like most places are just scams now. :(

				I&#039;m having the same problem.&nbsp; And I&#039;m experienced with btc., and this slowness like this is unusual.&nbsp; My wallet got 10 around 132000 blocks in a few hours, then slowed *way* down, and I&#039;m going on 48 hrs, and mine came direct from tradehill to the wallet.&nbsp; This was on a windows box, so I put a totally new wallet on my linux computer, and weird, that too got to around 130000 blocks in a couple hours, and now is slowing way down too...<br /><br />I know other times it &#039;seemed&#039; slow, but always within 6-24 hrs on a new wallet, and a transfer of btc usually within a few hrs....I&#039;d left some btc on SR, so I could get rolling, but they had dropped so much in value...<br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted OP to know that he wasn&#039;t alone with this...I&#039;m going to try next keeping it &#039;in the cloud&#039; and shuffle it around there, then to SR, but rite now, both wallets slow, not completing....
