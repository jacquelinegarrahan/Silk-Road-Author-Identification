				I was just curious, why are all the visible feedback removed when a vendor goes stealth??<br /><br />does anyone have any ideas why this is necessary?<br /><br />it seems to me the recent feedback should still be shown, if the vendor is able to conduct business - buyers need to be able to see what feedback has been left recently <br /><br />thoughts?

				Stealth is when the vendor wants total privacy...I believe that it&#039;s sort of a security measure...if a vendor wants to show feedback but not accept orders he or she can just take down all their active listings...

				when vendors are stealth, they can still conduct business. i understand if all their listings are down removing the feedback but just going stealth doesnt mean you stop selling. <br /><br />if they continue to have listings imo it is necessary for the buyers security to show the recent feedback<br /><br />if feedback isnt shown and a vendor starts scamming or there is an issue with a product - the comments are all hidden so the buyers cant tell and only see the score dropping but dont know why&nbsp; <br /><br />seems any benefits for the buyer far out weigh any risk for the vendor, maybe someone can point out a specific reason why this is necessary or some way have the feedback compromises the vendors stealth?<br /><br />is this something you would like to see changed so you are able to see a vendors recent reviews even when in stealth?<br /><br />thought i posted this earlier, dont know what happened
