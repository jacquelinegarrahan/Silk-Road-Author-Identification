				Never send anything to that yahoo! If it&#039;s the user I think it is, he used/still does, stalk the TOPIX forums with all kinds of<br />ads for trying to get people to buy cheap drugs from him at insanely low prices. Not to mention no way to prove he&#039;s ;egit,<br />except for some BS crappy pictures!!!

				Yea fuck Camroon!!!!! My dad almost fell victim to some bullshit they had going on about selling some animals an he almost sent this stupid bitch 200 bucks for 2 English bulldogs til i told him to let me research everything.. Come to find out i found other things with the exact same speech and everything this one person used back an forth through emails with my family member.. I hate LOW LIFE SCAMMERS!!!! I hate to say it but Most India and Paki ppl do the same thing also, Only do it with Bogus meds and beggin for money schemes. Only thing is i really think most of them are to stupid to know they truly have fake drugs, some im sure know it but alot dont cause they will send all kinda samples saying how great they are and how u will love them and be ordering in no time...LOL BS!!! Iv had a few people from India send me Meds that were somewht OK, and Paki ragheads are just full of shit..Only Indian seller i know and trust is on here by the name &#039;IndianPillDaddy&quot; But due to not seeing eye to eye at this point i no longer try to help them anymore either.
