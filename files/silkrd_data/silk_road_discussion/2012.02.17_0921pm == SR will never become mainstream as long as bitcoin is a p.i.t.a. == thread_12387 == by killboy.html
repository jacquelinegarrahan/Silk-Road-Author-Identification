				First of all, I think that the fact that SR will never go mainstream is a good thing. If all of a sudden this site traffic equal to something like Craigslist, the police would be compelled to do something. The fact that it&#039;s hard to find and set up is a blessing. For me, the best way to get bitcoins is to set up a Dwolla account, make a deposit there, transfer your deposit to Mt Gox, buy bitcoins there, and finally send them to your SR account. This process takes several days but it&#039;s worth it.

				OR! Go to wal-mart and get a MoneyPak, and trade through one of the vendors (used to be more, now only 2 and they are trying to keep up). Its through escrow, all contained within SR..If you have been creeping the forums for a while, you should know this by now! But good luck to you regardless! 8)<br /><br />-NS

				I&#039;ve been on SR for about two months or so now, and have been getting my BTC through the vendors on SR. Buy a moneypak, place a moneypak to BTC order and with some vendors you can literally have your coins within seconds, literally. Although, Suga Momma and BTC Buddy are a bit backed up as of late, there are always other vendors offering the service too, it&#039;s a super quick way to get coins. I love how easy, quickly and anonymously I get my coins! I also have the extra money to burn (at the moment) on the $5 MP fee and the vendors fee, so it works out great for my situation right now.

Check out the listings up on SR and the vendor pages and they should have their rates posted. It also depends on what the BTC market is like at the time of your transaction...<br />If there is a product I want for 26 BTC, I just ask a vendor how much $ I need to put on a MP to equal 26 BTC. Again, I spend a little extra but it&#039;s super easy, fast and anonymous!

				@kill- I did exactly what you said for my first transaction- mt gox to bitinstant. Then mt gox to instawallet then on to SR. I was in the bank making the deposit at 10 am and was ordering on SR at about 3 pm. Received my badass package 6 days later through snail mail. Not a major deal if you ask me and it worked just fine. Don&#039;t worry so much! And while there ARE legit MP traders on SR that is just way too easy to get scammed. When bitinstant works that well I don&#039;t see any reason to take the risk of 1. getting totally scammed or 2. sitting there waiting for days while all the larger MP&#039;s get done before yours. Just my .02.

				I&#039;m with A.Dubois. The bitinstant -&gt; mt.gox method worked really well for me today. I made a cash deposit and literally had my funds at mt. Gox within 15minutes. Super fast. I got my btc at market price and only had to pay a 4.49% transaction fee to bitinstant. I will gladly pay that for near instant btc.&nbsp; The longest part of the whole process was waiting for my coins to hit the SR wallet. Which was still under an hour. <br /><br />As to the point about Silk Road never going mainstream...I hope it doesn&#039;t. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I want to see it grow. Hell, I&#039;m new here and very thankful I found it. And the buyers there are its safe to say there will be more vendors. So I&#039;m all for site growth. But I agree that I would be scared if it reached Craigslist traffic level. It would definitely not be a good thing...IMO.<br /><br />

				I think that even if SR accepted credit cards, the majority of people are too ignorant to even realize the value that SR has.<br /><br />Most drug users wont see the ROI of getting A+ product thats 1000% better than local goods, delivered to your doorstep within a matter of days, with added protection of escrow vs sourcing locally.<br /><br />&quot;What? I have to wait a week to get an order? And these prices are so high! I can just go to the corner slingers and get it within minutes for cheaper!&quot;<br /><br />Those who see the vision flock here, and those who dont stay away. I think this is a good thing for SR. <br /><br />Or maybe I&#039;m just a severe pessimist when it comes to mankind :)

				I agree with you gatsby.. I even feel that in a lot of ways it is safer to order from SR than to get drugs on the street. I am definitely more comfortable checking the mail than driving around with stuff in the car.. and cameras are literally everywhere now, especially in the bigger cities. I am more than willing to put in the extra effort and pay a little bit extra knowing exactly what is going to happen. <br />

				I just bought some coins from get-bitcoin.com using the chase deposit method, I went into chase and made the deposit a few hours ago and was in and out within 2 minutes. There was a camera on the wall and the teller asked me my name which I was unprepared for, so I ended up saying my real one. Luckily they only wanted my first name. When I placed the order on get-bitcoin I had it directed straight to my SR wallet and I used a tormail address I made as the email, I also gave a fake name. I&#039;m getting kind of nervous now. Am I at risk of being caught somehow now? Is it going to matter that I used a fake name on get-bitcoin but I used my real name in the bank? Fuck

				I consider something mainstream when I overhear strangers talking about. Which has been the case several times in my experience regarding SR. It may be that SR is a bit more difficult for the average person to use, but doesn&#039;t that afford a built-in screening process? You have to have some level of competence to participate in this grand thing that is SR. The way I see it, SR is both mainstream and for those only in the know. We have here something completely new, revolutionary, even.<br /><br />~From the meadow, goatHerd<br />P.S. Use Sugar Mama for your BTC exchange. They are extremely friendly and reliable.

				Not sure I ever want to hear sr mentioned &#039;in real life&#039;. I really don&#039;t want to mention it due to my (perhaps a bit paranoid?) fear that it could end up biting me in the bollocks. But the temptation to speak about it when I hear people bemoan the quality or scarcity of *insert drug here*, or even if they were talking about an article. The temptation could become too great.

				I don&#039;t see why this thread is still active. BTC is not that hard to come by. <br /><br />Don&#039;t use the MP to BTC vendors, at least, I wouldn&#039;t. Not when you can do the anonymous deposit through Bitinstant and buy your coins right from MtGox. Not only is it easy enough for lab chimps, its also fast as hell. You&#039;ll have your BTC on silk road making purchases in less than 3 hours from start to finish. <br /><br />If you really think BTC are a pain in the ass, even with that simple and fast of a process, you might just be better off with a real world f2f drug dealer. Silk Road might not be for you...<br /><br />Cheers!<br />-Jig

				&nbsp;I agree with you...somewhat. On one hand, Having an easier process of exchanging currency into BTC would be grand! But, do we really WANT SR to become mainstream? I&#039;m not necessarily against SR growing, but what about all the complications that come along with a booming website? If large, legal sites such as craigslist get legal troubles, could you imagine the kind of negative attention SR would attract? I am thrilled I found this place, and yes, it took quite a bit of effort to actually use it; but this is a pretty effective screening process for unwanted attention. And now that I have found this amazing place of like minded folk, I don&#039;t want to see it go away.

				If someone is not willing to go through the time and effort (not really that hard) to learn the system and buy bits then they are more then likely to be reckless in the way the conduct themselves on SR and that is the last thing we need. SR does not need to be mainstream to be successful and it will more likely be more successful if it is not a mainstream thing that any teenager can get on buy some stuff and then do stupid things that hurt themselves or someone else and then blame it on SR. <br /><br />All it is going to take is one incident like that for parent groups to start making more noise about the site and force LE to go harder after it then it does now since and that is the last thing any of us need.
