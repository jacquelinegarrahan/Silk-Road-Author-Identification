				I&#039;ve recently noticed a sharp increase in the new LOTTERY postings. I was waiting for the forums to come back up so that I could see what others are saying and I couldn&#039;t find a topic about so here we are. All I could see were some postings here and there mentioning it on other threads.<br /><br />I see a few problems with this and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one so let&#039;s talk about it!<br /><br />I must say, I was initially excited when I saw these appearing and bought in on a few early ones. However, I soon discovered that it might not be so great.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s pretty obvious the feedback system is being horribly manipulated.<br />Drugs are being given away for free. (Think about what would happen locally if this were to occur)<br />Money is flowing to sellers even though there is no way to prove a REAL winner. (i.e. shill accounts) Small change adds up big. Hell, even if it just pays for their new sr seller account it was worth it, right?<br />Why would a seller need to run or care to run a lottery if there was not money to be made?<br />Are the majority of new listings I see going to be gimmicks like this week?<br /><br />I&#039;m a firm believer in letting products and service speak for themselves. Everything else just seems like hearsay and gimmicks. I personally think that Lotteries and promos should be run outside of sr, like here for instance. Like the name game ;-)<br /><br />IDK, just venting. What do you guys think about this stuff? I&#039;m interested to hear your perspectives. I think sometimes things are just too good to be true and I have to slap myself back into reality. Do you ever feel that way?<br /><br />&nbsp;:-\

				I posted this on tony&#039;s thread not too long ago, I&#039;ll cope&amp;paste here since it&#039;s relevant:<br /><br />I definitely agree with you. there are actually a few lotteries popping now. some for bud, some for dope; and I&#039;m sure more will be coming along as well.<br /><br />although, they can be fun and definitely a cool way to mix it up while attracting and generating potential buyers to a new vender, anyone who enters a lotto, definitely SHOULD NOT give the vender a 5/5 - at the VERY MOST - a 3/5 (and even that&#039;s pushing it)<br /><br />and that is definitely not to be a dick. it&#039;s logical. a 5/5 means that the vender has done an extremely satisfactory job with:<br />1. communication<br />2. shipping<br />3. packaging<br />4. product<br /><br />and you could possibly even add more variables as to why a 5/5 is an appropriate, deserving score for a vender. the point being, the perfect feedback rating comes to those venders who WORK for it.<br /><br />as for the lottos, the winner - and ONLY the winner (if there is a *real* winner) should be giving the vender a perfect rating - and that&#039;s ONLY if they even receive the damn product and everything else was satisfactory.<br /><br />as for everyone else, anything above a 3/5 is just plain absurd and stupid. if the vender happens to be a scammer, you&#039;re just adding to his potential scam and helping them fuck many, many other people over.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I have to agree that this is something that really needs to be looked at. It IS an unfair manipulation of the rating system, and as was mentioned, the rating system should be a reflection of the quality of a vendor&#039;s business practice, and not how cleverly they can get people to rank them without delivering a product. I hate to think that our quality vendors who have worked hard to achieve their ranking are being passed as I type this by people who have never delivered a single thing!<br /><br />All of that being said, I like the idea of something for almost nothing as much as the next junkie. There needs to be some accountability, though- at the very least a trusted third party to be an administrator of these lotteries. No lottery on the planet is run entirely by the individual whose pocket the winner is paid out of. That is just begging for corruption.<br /><br />The idea of raising interest and promoting a product is fine- but there are other, proven ways to do this that don&#039;t compromise the system.<br /><br />I think that if DPR is okay with this, he needs to get involved and work out a system that holds the vendor hosting the lottery accountable, as well as taking the rating system out of the picture. I believe that this is the only way to protect the system, the vendors and the buyer. We all count on the rating system to make informed choices, and it has to maintain some integrity.<br /><br />Just my .02 BTC.

				@obamagirl: did I specifically say that you - and only you - should never hold a lottery? no, of course not. but I hope you realize that I - or anyone else in this thread - is, by no means, directly referring to you. that is just silly. there is no need to defend yourself since no offense was intended. <br /><br />but you have to and realize and agree that any lottery held by a new vender is just begging for corruption. as someone else said, the rating system is to give an accurate portrayal of venders to help new buyers decide whether they should put their trust and their coin with a vender; hopefully helping them avoid being scammed. but when everyone is rating a new vender a perfect rating - when absolutely no product, no communication, no shipping, and no packaging has been done - it manipulates the system, putting trust where no trust should be quickly put. therefore, when a new buyer sees that a vender is ranked #30 out of 300, has over 200 transactions, and a rating of 100%, they are most likely going to put their trust in them without fully understanding why he shouldn&#039;t. <br /><br />and this debate isn&#039;t to condemn ALL lotteries; because I agree, they can be extremely helpful to a vender - but it becomes very shady when a brand new vender holds one and many people begin to buy from, potentially fucking dozens and dozens of new members out of there money - ultimately wrecking their SR experience right off the bat and scaring away many potential buyers. and that isn&#039;t good for anyone.

My lotto is set up so I make money the other guys is just set up for some feedback. I am going to pay a winner in each lotto alot more than their ticket cost. I am still going to be shipping out my high quality products also.<br /><br />Even though we see a little differently on this issue I firmly believe that you (tony76) is a better vendor than wumg00. I recommend anyone purchasing good H to use tony76 as opposed to wumg00. All the products sold by tony76 that wumg00 sells are better than wumg00s products.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for the kind words.. I&#039;m a little confused why the comparison to wumg00 though.. From what i&#039;ve heard he is a pretty respected vendor on here, and super friendly from all my talking to him..<br /><br />Did i miss something?

				With the current system of ratings it will always be easy to generate ratings, free samples, lotteries, low value sales to yourself (to minimise SR commision), can easily generate a 100% rating for 15-20 sales maybe more,&nbsp; until the rating system is changed this will always be manipulated.&nbsp; Perhaps including value of sales in ratings, would improve the system.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps for LOTTO&#039;s to eliminate fixing SR could provide an application, that Vendors operate the lottery through the app, but it goes into a different escrow account, and the prize is drawn randomly by SR and the vendor only receives the money after the &quot;winning order&quot; is finalized, if not finalized either all money refunded, or winner gets all.

They don&#039;t even take regard to the amount of law enforcement attention drawn because of all their lotto&#039;s. Lotto&#039;s are going to be the down fall of Silk Road. Because gambling law enforcement are now going to launch enforcement on Silk Road since they are biting into their market.<br /><br />Dam those lotto bastards. I hate illegal gambling.

				This lotto bullshit is a horrible thing for SR.&nbsp; Sure it sounds good in theory, but in reality it is just a ploy to build user stats.&nbsp; These people are going to sell 100 $1 listings and get all positive feedback for what?&nbsp; Who knows if they are even going to ship the item to a winner.&nbsp; They may not even pick a winner at random, they may just have a shill account to be set as the winner.&nbsp; It&#039;s not right!&nbsp; It&#039;s all about building their feedback to have a better chance of scamming in the future.<br /><br />Hell the person hosting the lottery may not even have the product.&nbsp; They could be just waiting to get enough in lottery cash to turn a little profit for themselves then ordering through a legit vendor and having them ship it directly to the &quot;winner&quot;.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, I just don&#039;t like it and think it is just a ploy to build positive feedback.

				I&#039;m a soon-to-be seller and I have to say I got mixed feelings when I saw these lotteries..<br />I mean, it&#039;s fuckin clear the point is not the lottery.. it&#039;s just a loophole to increase the stats.<br /><br />At the same time I was thinking.. what the fuck, when I&#039;m gonna have the seller account up this is clearly the fastest way to get some stats ( obviously you still need to hang around the forums, send samples and stuff ).<br />Not to disrespect all the sellers that worked their asses off till now, but just to keep up with the rest of the sellers if this becomes the norm.<br /><br />I think as it is right now it&#039;s fucked up to the old sellers and it&#039;s perfect for scammers as well.. It looks like something it can grow to really create problems in the community.<br />I guess this problem is gonna be addressed structurally by SR, I think a value-based feedback like padawan suggested or something similar it&#039;s the way.

				SR has already posted earlier that he is going to be dealing with this issue because it is gaming the system - newbs should have to go through the ringer twice before they can get something like this up and people take it seriously.<br /><br />For the record, I&#039;m currently running a lottery.&nbsp; That being said, I also have 500 legit transactions on SR, am the oldest weed seller on here now, and I think I&#039;ve earned my stripes (how many of us are left from the days with no bitcoin hedging, when buyers and sellers were both trying to play the currency fluctuations against each other, and the only thing that kept me alive is that I do a really brisk f2f business that subsidized me while the situation was sorted out by DPR?).&nbsp; My review topic is over 8 months old and has over 250 posts with more than 4,700 views.<br /><br />The proposed system is that small listings like digital goods and lotto tickets will have no feedback weighting, or a VERY TINY weighting, so it would take thousands of these to equal out to a bulk transaction.&nbsp; I am fully on board for this.&nbsp; This is the first lotto I&#039;m running and it&#039;s mainly for the purpose of generating some new interest in my products and to have some fun.&nbsp; If I do any future ones, I have already contacted SR about this, and I if I&#039;m going to start lotto-ing out OZ&#039;s of my high end cannabis and mushrooms I will purchase a completely separate vendor&#039;s account with the express purpose of doing that, and only that.<br /><br />As for your 3/5, 5/5, etc.&nbsp; I can&#039;t agree that you should be leaving a vendor a partial feedback on a lotto order, unless you are just throwing your coins out into the ether.&nbsp; The system I have proposed goes like this:<br /><br />Buyer purchases lotto ticket(s).&nbsp; Once I see the order on my Orders page, I pull the username down and add it to a chronological list of all ticket/users who have purchased, and each ticket is assigned a number (so johnny123 bought the first 5 tickets, he gets numbers 1-5, sarah234 bought the next 3, she gets 6-8, and so on).&nbsp; I update a post on the lotto thread with the username/ticket list, and THEN I mark the item in transit.&nbsp; Buyers double check to make sure that their ticket count is correct, and message me if there are any errors.&nbsp; If there are not, they finalize the item because they have been confirmed as entered.<br /><br />Once the entries are complete (tomorrow night), I will use a web-based random number generator that allows me to enter outside parameters (if I have 250 total tickets, the outside parameters are 1 and 250, and the random number generator will select a number from inside that range).&nbsp; I will screenshot the winning number for the grand prize, and another screenshot for second place.&nbsp; Then I will post the winning numbers and it is up to the winning user to come take a look and see if they won.&nbsp; I will set up one listing for 0.01 BTC for the grand prize winner, and another for 0.01 BTC for the runner up.&nbsp; Item ships, they receive, everything is good.<br /><br />Under the new weighting system no aspect of this would really affect my rank, or the rank of the lotto account I will open if this one runs well.&nbsp; This is mostly a marketing thing for me, and I&#039;m hoping to basically break even on product cost + shipping, and nothing more.&nbsp; If there&#039;s a couple of BTC in it to justify all the time spent updating the ticket list and such, that&#039;s cool.&nbsp; But I am hoping for future sales, and that is all.<br /><br />If you want the details, the thread for my lotto is here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12153.0

				I saw all the new vendors throwing up lotteries and thought &#039;this is wrong, cant rack up hundreds of orders within a few days without shipping actual product&#039;, then went on my way happy hunting among legit SR listings.<br /><br />Then I saw anarcho&#039;s lottery and thought &#039;FUCK YEAH! solid vendor generating buzz around his product, anarcho knows how to run a business!&quot;. immediately purchased a few of his lotto tickets. <br /><br />I did feel a little dirty bc now my transaction history is padded with a few lotto orders, but my stats were A+ beforehand so not losing sleep over it.<br /><br />BUT, IMHO, a newb with 0 transactions buying 10x lotto listings feels like fraud to me.<br /><br />Can vendors see what the actual listings buyer purchased in past? or just # orders, refund rate, etc?<br />

				I think enough information would be gleaned from total BTC spent (which we currently cannot see) as the only statistical addition on buyer side.&nbsp; If someone has 50 transactions but only 30BTC spent that&#039;s a &quot;move on&quot; buyer.<br /><br />That&#039;s the only addition I would ask for.<br /><br />I also check user number and keep track of how many people have signed up for the site.&nbsp; If I see someone who&#039;s &quot;two weeks old&quot; with 20 transactions, I usually ask them to get a substance vendor they have done business with to send me a PM and vouch.&nbsp; If I can&#039;t get it, I won&#039;t do business.

As likely to receive from him as you are a domestic vendor.<br /><br />I feel like those from him that dont make it are simply lost, destroyed in a sorting machine or ganked by your sticky fingered local postman, not customs seizing. Which are just as likely to happen to a package from US state.

				You like my packaging, Gatsby? ;)<br /><br />I take some serious pride in the planning I put into my packaging and I think I&#039;ve got my methods down pretty well.&nbsp; Always room for improvement, mind you, and I welcome feedback on it.&nbsp; But yes I have extremely high success rates getting packages into the US, and I&#039;m damned proud of that because most of you guys have awful weed compared to what &quot;average&quot; stock is up here.&nbsp; So to be able to send you some bomb Canadian bud is a damned pleasure :)

I was waiting for the forums to come back up so that I could see what others are saying and I couldn&#039;t find a topic about so here we are. All I could see were some postings here and there mentioning it on other threads.<br /><br />I see a few problems with this and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one so let&#039;s talk about it!<br /><br />I must say, I was initially excited when I saw these appearing and bought in on a few early ones. However, I soon discovered that it might not be so great.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s pretty obvious the feedback system is being horribly manipulated.<br />Drugs are being given away for free. (Think about what would happen locally if this were to occur)<br />Money is flowing to sellers even though there is no way to prove a REAL winner. (i.e. shill accounts) Small change adds up big. Hell, even if it just pays for their new sr seller account it was worth it, right?<br />Why would a seller need to run or care to run a lottery if there was not money to be made?<br />Are the majority of new listings I see going to be gimmicks like this week?<br /><br />I&#039;m a firm believer in letting products and service speak for themselves. Everything else just seems like hearsay and gimmicks. I personally think that Lotteries and promos should be run outside of sr, like here for instance. Like the name game ;-)<br /><br />IDK, just venting. What do you guys think about this stuff? I&#039;m interested to hear your perspectives. I think sometimes things are just too good to be true and I have to slap myself back into reality. Do you ever feel that way?<br /><br />&nbsp;:-\<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah, the lotto is definitely a problem... Vendors get there stats up for basically nothing.

				Buyers should not rely only on stats number. They should hoover the mouse over the purchased item for what is feedback given.<br />If buyer notice that majority of sale was for lotto items then he can have more insight on seller reputation overall.<br /><br />Bottom line, all need to take a time to see for which items are feedback and to read the forum and on that decide accordingly. <br />For some vendors, rank, number of sales and reputation percentage is not enough for decision esp if they carry lotto or other similar items.

				lottos shouldn&#039;t matter as of this morning.&nbsp; SR posted that he is implementing the recommended changes immediately (that lotto and digital listings have no weight), so ranks should revert back to an appropriate level by the end of the day.<br /><br />Yup, I just checked - change has taken effect.<br /><br />This guy WAS ranked at number 6 last night.&nbsp; Today he&#039;s 232<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/164457
