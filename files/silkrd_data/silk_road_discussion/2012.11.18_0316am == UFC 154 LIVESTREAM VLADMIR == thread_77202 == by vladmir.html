				GSP is a hard hard cunt, I think much tougher than Silva (a HUGE statement I know), but would he have the technical skill required to beat Silva?<br /><br />In a street fight, GSP or Silva... who would win and why?

				It wasn&#039;t that great of a fight imo. Just about as lopsided as the recent Jones v. Belefort or Silva v. Bonnar main events. Belefort&#039;s armbar attempt was the only thing he had going, similar to how Condit&#039;s one headkick was his only chance.<br /><br />GSP needs to fight Nick Diaz!
