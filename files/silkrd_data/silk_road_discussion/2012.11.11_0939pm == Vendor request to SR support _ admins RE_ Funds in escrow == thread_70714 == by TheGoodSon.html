				That wouldnt be fair to auto finalize all of the transactions currently in escrow...I, for example have a very large order, which is set to autofinalize tonight, that I need to take to resolution because there was a mix up on the vendor&#039;s end.&nbsp; SR isn&#039;t going to be back up until tomorrow, so it is my hopes that they dont let ANYTHING autofinalize, otherwise, I may be screwed!<br /><br />I do see where you are coming from though, as I too have a vendor account, with MANY orders that I am sure are delivered by now, and I need that money.&nbsp; <br /><br />This whole situation has sucked for everyone, but in my 14 months of being here, in all my experiences, I have found that DPR and the Admins are always fair and just.&nbsp;

				Yeah, kinda sucks for the vendors. I know my 2 vendors have a lot tied up, I got everything, feel bad they can&#039;t touch their money.

				It&#039;s unfortunate but no WAY should that happen. Absolutely no funds should move until people have been given a reasonable amount of time to review and catch up.<br /><br />I do not want an order I could not log in to open a resolution on to auto-finalise while SR is down. That would be a total disaster.

				Absolutely unfair proposition. I agree that vendors are getting screwed, and deserve the BTC they&#039;re in the hole for before it loses a lot of worth, but that&#039;s not the way.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have a lot of orders processing. If they all finalized, those that haven&#039;t shipped (even if they&#039;re marked as in transit) I won&#039;t be seeing. Come on. You know even honorable vendors might take advantage of something like that.

I most likely do a significantly larger portion of business than you do, but I would never take money from buyers that I had not yet earned.<br /><br />A vendor can flip at any time, SR knows that. It&#039;s a daily grind to prove ourselves. I STILL, after all my work here, have people in the resolution center asking me if I even shipped their item. And though it can be a frustrating burden to the vendor, it&#039;s a healthy distrust that keeps the road wary of scammers and LE. That&#039;s what has kept and will keep us successful as we move along.

				my thoughts...as a vendor..are that I knew what I was getting into dealing in illegal items online.... one day and hopefully that day may never come, I may lose my money in sr...escrow...or overall goods. But we all kinda know thats the name of the game in the business we are in. Good things do not last forever. knock on wood

				If SR is back up tomorrow, this is moot, right? So you probably jumped the gun a little bit. But if, worst case scenario it takes another week to get SR back up, I&#039;m sure you could ask your customers to sign a modest statement you write up, pledging that they received their order, are happy and content, and would like their funds released to you. Now, I don&#039;t really understand the inner workings of this whole SR btc machine, but I gather that DPR &amp; crew have the ability to deal with accounts and transactions at the individual level. Also, I don&#039;t know what kind of manpower DPR &amp; Crew have available to address accounts on a case by case basis, but I bet, having read again and again how fair and just DPR &amp; Crew, I bet if you asked really nicely, if this drags on for a week and DPR &amp; Crew aren&#039;t inundated with similar requests, DPR &amp; Crew would get those funds released to you.<br /><br />Obviously, in no way do I want to pretend to speak for DPR &amp; Crew, this is just my impression of what they stand for. But anyway, it&#039;s all moot if SR is back up tomorrow, right? ;)
