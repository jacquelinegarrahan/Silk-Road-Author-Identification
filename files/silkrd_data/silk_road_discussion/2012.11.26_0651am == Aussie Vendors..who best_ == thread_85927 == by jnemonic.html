				Hi, i&#039;m getting ready to make my first purchase, and have been reading all the reviews left from customers and everything..<br /><br />Theres a lot of mixed reviews, and some really stupid ones.. ??? Why leave a review if you havent had the product? Sure, great the shipping was quick, but i dont want to know that.<br />Why leave a review on something when you have mixed organics with inorganics, and cant give a decent review which is what we all want.<br />I want something that will blow me away, not in the mood for a tickle.<br /><br />All i want is kick ass MDMA, thats it. I havent had it in awhile, a long time....and from what i&#039;ve been reading, they dont seem to be strong enough?<br />One vendor is selling mdma in 120mg caps...but why 120mg? They should be 140-150mg at least surely?<br /><br />I&#039;d rather buy here, but Chemical Brothers is looking really tempting. Quality pressed tabs with high mdma content.<br /><br />Has anyone from Oz bought from Chemical Bro&#039;s?<br /><br />Has anyone bought great, awesome and splendidly wicked mdma from an aussie vendour?<br />If so please let me know thanks... ;)

				International is obviously appealing price-wise, but from what I&#039;ve been reading (and hearing) lately, the success rates are becoming so low that its almost a waste of time trying.<br /><br />Some international vendors are updating their pages specifically for the low AU success rate, which makes me think either the majority of AU buyers are being scammed relentlessly (possible), or Customs are really ramping up in AU (also possible).<br /><br />Either way, it seems most AU buyers are restricted to AU vendors.

				Yeah that could be the factor for sure, but dont the aussie vendors have their product shipped from overseas? <br /><br />Or some of them might just be cooks, and just make out as though its imported...?<br /><br />I hate customs, imagine some of the parties those clones have had with peoples product, can just imagine it...<br />I&#039;m sure customs know what to look for by now...cards from holland, etc are a dead giveaway now...<br /><br />Well all i can do is try i guess...but hoping to hear from someone who has actually bought from them.<br /><br />I&#039;m just worried the reviews are all from the same person....well most of them. I just want confirmation.. :P<br /><br /><br />
