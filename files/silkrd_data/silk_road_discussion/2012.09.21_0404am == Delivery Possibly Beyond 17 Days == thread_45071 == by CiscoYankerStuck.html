				I have a delivery on the way, from quite a distance.<br /><br />I expect to receive it before auto finalization, but IF it were to not arrive before then, is there any protocol for dealing with this?<br /><br />Say, extending the auto finalize date?

				Click on resolve before it autofinnalizes.&nbsp; It will allow you to offer the vendor the choice of refund, reship, or extension on delivery.&nbsp; Just offer them another 7 day&#039;s or whatever, if it hasn&#039;t arrived after that then you&#039;ll have to take it up with the resolution center and the vendor.

				The simple answer is yes.<br />The above person is correct, but I always PM a vendor (once, not 3 times a day) and try to work with them BEFORE resolution.<br />You will find;<br />You make a new friend.<br />They will hopefully guide you to the best solution, if they give a crap.<br />You go to resolution together it makes it easier on SR Support, they will extend almost instantly as they can, cause you two are in agreement, which is encouraged around here.<br /><br />Most vendors want a perfect score so they are more than willing to help.<br />It&#039;s during&nbsp; these times you learn who to trust.<br /><br />At this time;<br />Do not trash the vendor<br />Do not threaten the vendor<br />Be nice<br />Do not PM the vendor daily, just enough to get info.<br />If the vendor doesn&#039;t respond, you can go to war, but give them a chance to make good.<br /><br />This all takes extra time.

				Good luck. Hopefully you don&#039;t get one of the assholes that make you FE and then wait 30DAYS for your resolution.

				Thanks all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve contacted the vendor and let him/her/them know what&#039;s up.<br /><br />I&#039;m not worried about being scammed as the vendor is pretty reputable and the delivery is quite a distance. (I won&#039;t FE anyway).&nbsp; I&#039;m actually more concerned with the vendor thinking I&#039;m a scammer, as this is my first purchase.
