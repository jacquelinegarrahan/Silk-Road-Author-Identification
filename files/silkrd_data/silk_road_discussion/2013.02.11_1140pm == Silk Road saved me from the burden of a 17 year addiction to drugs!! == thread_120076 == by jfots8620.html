				you no what else, i had maybe one year total abstinence throughout all that time with help of AA. i dont knock the program at all but i see why its founder bill w. was a heavy psychedelic user in the 50s and 60s up to his death.. it was always told to me ,that only way to break the cycle was through spiritual experience.. i never understood,but deff do now! some are able to achieve without chemical but not many and thats why such low success rate in the rooms.. so sad so many people are either scared to try a psychedelic or as for people in program they believe it as a drug.. lol.. deff nothing but a tool if used correctly.. also realized drugs were just a symptom of my main problem which was all my fears and selfish tendencies.. thank you god and thank you ailk road for giving me my life back,for good and my familt back!!just gotta work on some kind of self forgiveness and deal with the grimy things i did in depths of mostly my crack addiction... hard to even think bout ,dont no where to start to actually face them..sorry just kind of thinking out loud...

				Great story and congratulations. <br /><br />The path to recovery or wellness&nbsp; takes a different route for everyone. The system is too set on a cookie cutter approach that just doesn&#039;t work for everyone. <br /><br />Glad you found a way that works for you and the will to see it through despite nay sayers. Wish you continued success.<br />

				Much good luck to you!! Dmt and other psychedelics&nbsp; help so much with harmful addictions.<br />&nbsp;Nicotine will be the worst of all drugs to kick ;{<br />Over time and struggle it is beatable, just don&#039;t get discouraged. <br />Quit as many times as you need to and never be embarrassed when you backslide.<br />Eventually you will come out ahead.<br />Nicotine is an evil master, worse than benzos, opoids or stimulants.<br />When you finally overcome it, remember; you can never have even one puff again&nbsp; or you will be a smoker. <br />Maybe not that minute, but soon.<br />Of all the drugs I&#039;ve ever quit (or been forced to) the worst one by far was nicotine.

I was shot 4 years ago with a .38 at point blank in my side, it hit my ribs, it was a hollow tip it shaatterd 2 of my ribs and broke a 3rd.<br /><br />So iv had a dotor feel good who would give me anything the first 2 years.. But before that i started OC=OXYCONTIN at 15 or 16 one or the other and i was full blown adddicted by 17 man..Im almost 27 now and i still battle with opiates.. The thing is if i dont take any pain meds, not only do i get sick from my addiction my pain is awful smetimes.. Now im with a doc who truly is out to help and not just supply me with whatever drugs i want for a xtra 100 or 200 in the office..<br /><br />I get 300 methadone,xanax and diladids ..Now the good thing is i dont abuse my dones, dont even take the 10 a day like prescribed only 3 to 4 sometimes 5..But im addicted to Benzos also.. I take 1mg 2x a day.. But i come here and buy more cause i run out. THE DILADIDS r the issue, every mnth i get them i Inject them, I only get 30 ,and this month i got a new brand of dilys i didnt know were made and their by purdu their orange have a P and then the MG but i swear they are stronger than the other brands...&nbsp; I wanna tell him to take me off but the addict in me wants to shoot that day of the month..<br /><br />Again though Congrats to you man!! u gave me inspiration reading this. All my teenage and adult life i have been HIGH and i dont know how to live without being high in&nbsp; some way, docs say i will always have to take meds for my anxiety and my injury..<br /><br />iI wish i would have known this about LSD helping.. Iv never tried it but i was sent 2 hits but gave them along with 4 gramsof pure MDMA away for 10 roxi 30mg..&nbsp; <br /><br />Speaking of LSD IF U LOVE IT TRY VENDOR NAMED &#039;TESSALATED&#039; I think thats it..the avengers can tell u,bt ppl say its very clean,comes from canada and stealth is great!<br />

				Thats great news brother.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know whether or not I should post my private life on here but this thread made me change my mind, I got addicted to benzo&#039;s (Valium) and cannabis has got me from a heavy daily dose of 40-60mg down to 1ml current dose soon to be 0.5mg then I jump at 0.5mg and withdraw. <br /><br />If it was not for cannabis this would not have been possible and I am lucky some what in the sense I have good RL connections for weed but nothing compared to the variety SR gave me, now I can pick my strains for morning, daytime and night time use. Cannabis just takes the edge off and puts me in the right frame of mind for withdrawal it relieves pain it helps sleep so many different things and from the start I have classed withdrawing from Valium as a prison sentence its the only way I can get through and its been so much easier with cannabis in my life at first I thought I was the only person in the world using weed to get off drugs I thought this is crazy but then I done a lot of pain staking research which was not easy and found that there are thousands of people in the USA&nbsp; all in the same boat as me and with the sudden boom in medical cannabis spreading like wild fire across America.<br />The USA is known for its addictions to prescription pain pills has lead to a massive raise in people using weed to get off drugs, cannabis is now being classed in many circles as &#039;&#039;The exit drug&#039;&#039;<br /><br />I am just so very happy I am almost free of this government manufactured shit they call Valium, I ask any SR members who are thinking about using Valium to be very careful as addiction gets you with out you even realizing and its a mother fucker to get off cant do it cold turkey you have to taper if you been using for a while please please use this drug only in emergencies. <br /><br />I would like to thank gods for creating this holy herb in the first place and I would like to thank jfots for being brave enough to share his story which gave me the courage to write this and a big thanks to silk road you are literally saving lives especially for those in the medical weed community, many thanks.<br /><br />:)

				Great story!&nbsp; Like everyone who posted before me, I love hearing about things like that especially here because SR, being somewhat of a &quot;drug bazaar&quot; can easily give you the image of tons of irresponsible doped up junkie drug addicts continually perpetuating the cycle of poly-drug abuse.<br /><br />But that image is so far from the reality of this place.&nbsp; I think most members here are bright, upstanding people with more or less a good head on their shoulders (not everyone, sadly, but a good number).&nbsp; Some people have troubles especially with addiction, and SR gives those people a unique way to manage their addiction on their own terms.&nbsp; Addiction therapy is a complicated subject, and there are only so many tools IRL that people are willing to use and that genuinely work--SR is a unique, novel tool that I know can help some people who suffer from addiction and have tried other classical methods of treatment without success.<br /><br />Since I joined here, I&#039;ve cut all ties with my RL hookups for opioids, and I&#039;ve found that the unique nature of making purchases through SR has definitely helped me manage my addiction.&nbsp; Without SR, I would probably never have willingly cut ties IRL, but once I was turned on to it, I didn&#039;t even hesitate--I knew that cutting ties IRL was necessary to get over my addiction, and even though I still use, I am proud to say that my use is much more responsible now.<br /><br />Heh and as for LSD, my first trip put two words into my head--&quot;burn&quot; and &quot;clean.&quot;&nbsp; Burn because it made my entire body and mind feel like they were burning with hot electricity (in a great way), and Clean because the trip gave me a huge sense of cleanliness, again in both my body and mind.&nbsp; After the trip when I was reintegrating, I took the &quot;clean&quot; image and applied it to myself in order to quit using tobacco.&nbsp; I went from half a pack a day to nothing almost immediately.&nbsp; I originally started to taper, but every cig I smoked after that trip just felt counter to the &quot;clean&quot; that I felt when I was tripping, and that dirty feeling was what helped me to quit.&nbsp; Cigs always felt &quot;dirty&quot; to me, but it wasn&#039;t until the LSD that that dirty feeling became overwhelming enough for me to resist the urge.<br /><br />Anyway, like I said, I&#039;m not sober by any means, but I can at least go a few months now content with a few cocktails and nothing harder, and not have the constant urge to alter my state of mind using other substances.&nbsp; Before SR and before my LSD experiences, the thought of being sober for months at a time used to scare the fuck out of me.<br /><br />Good luck and keep it up!
