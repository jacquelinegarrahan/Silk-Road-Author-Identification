				So why do I always read the importance of Bitcoin purchase anonymity if Bitcoin purchases cannot be traced?&nbsp; I mean who cares if you buy Bitcoins with your bank account if your Bitcoin purchases cannot be traced?&nbsp; There is no Tax on Bitcoins so there is n need for recoynygdprds or receipts.

				Yes there must be way to trade Bitcoins anonymously buy why when Bitcoin transactions are not traceable.Bitcoin transactions are not taxable and so there is no need to keep records.&nbsp; If anyone asks what you traded your Bitcoins for just say it&#039;s none of their business.&nbsp; Or you forgot because your not required to keep Bitcoin records...lol

				If you want to be very cautious.. Say you purchased your coins non-anonymously, and believe they are linked to you in some way (however small it may be).<br /><br />You can send them here first: fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion , then to your SR wallet. (1-3% fee btw)<br /><br />Even if someday, an investigation is done (however unlikely it may be) - showing you brought those coins and sent them to a &#039;SR Address&#039;, mixing those coins first would make it extremely difficult to link the two addresses.`

				If you are slack and buy coins easily linked to you, yes, it&#039;s theoretically possible LE could show you are sending coin to SR, but not much more than that I think..<br /><br />Also, it would be a shit-load of work for possibly no/little reward.<br /><br />If you are buying bulk however, yeah, you better be sure that coin can&#039;t be traced as going straight to SR from your hands.

Generated addresses are generated addresses, regardless of where they reside. You think there are a pool of Addresses labeled &#039;THE ADDRESSES OF SR USERS&#039;? Dont get me wrong, I wash coin extensively but if you&#039;re just a buyer I truly don&#039;t understand why your putting yourself through so much stress. Worrying about ordering from vendors who wont get you busted IRL should be your top concern as a buyer.
