				There must be a way of losing the dick who clogs up the forums about btc website. I know he keeps making new forum names but he pushing the same website. Wouldn&#039;t just blocking anyone typing that website solve it? I&#039;m sure its not that easy so shoot me down quickly and painlessly, but also add alternative solutions to get rid of the asshole from the forums.<br /><br />sparkus88

				It&#039;s 100x better since they added captchas a week or two ago. A spam thread here and there doesn&#039;t bug me, it was when entire first page+ of every forum section was filled with spam that had me bummed. Now these guys just look pathetic and ineffectual, not so annoying or frustrating anymore. ymmv

				We were bitcoin spammer free for a while back due to the captchas you needed to complete to post a message, unfortunately they&#039;ve turned those off for some reason. <br /><br />Would be happy to see them back &amp; the forums free of spam.

				I can think of a couple of ways to mitigate the spam problem. They&#039;re not 100% solutions since the spammer could attempt to adapt his methods (though I&#039;m guessing the whole spam thing is a bot anyway). A regular expression could be added server side to automatically prevent any post with the site name from being accepted. You could schedule this to run via Cron so automatically clean up spam post meeting the pattern. Another method, depending on if the forums are on a server running mod_security, would be to add a mod_security rule to do the same thing. If the patern matches post doesn&#039;t get through. You could also try the hidden form field trick for forum registrations to try and trip the spammer up if it is a bot. Humans wouldn&#039;t see the hidden form field but bots process the entire thing and would stupidly try to fill the hidden field in. On a clearnet site you&#039;d have more options, but these are the few I can think of off the top of my head that would help without completely damaging our privacy.

I mean, a nic specifically made up for a single &#039;unpopular&#039; thread. Might kill two birds with one razor. I like it. <br /><br />Also, what&#039;s the deal with the Attach section? It won&#039;t let me upload a pic, even though I selected small ones. :(&nbsp; You know, I confused this with the Verification (catchpa?) when I was new. I thought SR had given me a virus.

				Captchas are useless anyway. Almost every bot I experience on my clearnet sites has a way of entering the correct codes with little trouble. Even recaptcha codes are little challenge for most bots these days.

				Contemplating the suggestion &quot;Minimum post requirement,&quot; do you guys think this would eventually cause loads of BS in the threads we started? I&#039;m going to have to say most likely. If he can&#039;t start new threads until he posts 10 times, well then he is going to complete this requirement. Wouldn&#039;t you say?<br /><br />My suggestion is Auto-WordBan<br />Wordban Bitkoin<br />wordban www&nbsp; (I don&#039;t think any of us here want people posting Clearnet links in the Subject anyway)<br />wordban <br /><br />My second suggestion is &quot;Vote to Delete thread&quot;<br />Only Sr. Members can vote<br /><br />The guy is a douchebag and has to look in the mirror every day knowing it.
