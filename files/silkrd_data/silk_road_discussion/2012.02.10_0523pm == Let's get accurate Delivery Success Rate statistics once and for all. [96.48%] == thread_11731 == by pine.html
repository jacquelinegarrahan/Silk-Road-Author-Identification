				I want each buyer to give me the following items:<br /><br />1. No. of packages sent to you. <br />2. No. of packages that arrived.<br />3. Your (rough) geographical location e.g. UK, USA<br /><br />Simple enough, but we need lots of replies to get a decent estimate. Contriboot data points!<br /><br />--<br />I&#039;m not a big fan of heuristics and rules of thumb. I&#039;m not pedantic to the 4th decimal point either, but I&#039;d like to know the reality of package successful delivery and I imagine you guys are interested as well, so I need about a dozen or so replies for each country to establish a realistic average for the Delivery Success Rate. This way we can finally talk a bit more intelligently about actual intercept ratios/packages that didn&#039;t make it. Obviously there&#039;s flaws in such analysis, but we&#039;re not aiming to be statistician of the year here.<br />--<br /><br />TIA!<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Current Status:<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Thread Resurrection Update:<br /><br />DSR: 96.484375%<br /><br />Results: 1729 out of 1792 packages arrived without incident.<br /><br />--------------------------------------

				Interesting idea. I&#039;ll bite.<br /><br />1. 5<br />2. 4<br />3. All were US to US with an average speed of 3-5 days.<br /><br />The one I didn&#039;t get was probably my own fault.&nbsp; Finalized early, never got it. So far for me 100% success for in escrow and 0% OOE.&nbsp; lol coincidence?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know...

				imho this exercise is useful only for domestic orders unless you break down statistics by the country of origin. Some countries are known as places of origin for drugs, but aren&#039;t watched by all other countries. Shipments from Aliceland might be suspicious in Bobistan, but common to Caroleria.

				You could just get statistics straight from the government agencies. USPI publishes how many people they arrest per year for getting drugs in the mail. Would be NICE IF WE HAD A DEDICATED INTELLIGENCE SUBFORUM FOR THE GROUP GATHERING AND ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION LIKE THIS, but for some reason everyone in any power position here completely ignores my request for this despite the clear benefits of having such a subforum<br /><br />http://www.postalinspectorsvideo.com/uspis/AnnualReport2010.pdf<br /><br />I think ICE publish statistics also....but fuck me digging it up (or digging through my massive collection of LE documents) for this forum if I can&#039;t even get an intelligence sub forum here<br /><br />in 2010 uspi had (for drug in the mail crimes)<br /><br />1,075 investigations opened, 1,322 arrests, 481 indictments, 1,083 convictions<br /><br />that covers the majority of domestic arrests for drugs via mail....for international we will need to get ICE statistics. Go ahead and look for other nations also, I used to have shit from Australia and a few other places. We might need to get DEA statistics also but I think USPI is the primary agency that manages domestic drugs in the mail, and ICE is the primary agency that manages international packs. Although I think even if a pack passes customs it could still be snagged later on by USPI, ICE doesn&#039;t screen domestic to domestic mail though. <br /><br />Welcome to open source intelligence. <br /><br />edit: Hm on second thought this isn&#039;t the same as interceptions, since some of the people they busted obviously had multiple interceptions, and some were getting packs and some were sending packs out. It also includes drug money and paraphernalia. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The U.S. Postal Inspection Service interdicts mail-<br />ings of illegal drugs and drug proceeds and inves-<br />tigates organized narcotic distribution groups to<br />protect employees and customers from the violence<br />related to drug trafficking and to preserve the integ-<br />rity of the U.S. Mail. Postal Inspectors, often work-<br />ing with other law enforcement officials, arrested<br />1,322 suspects for drug trafficking via the mail in<br />FY 2010.

But we don&#039;t want the criminals to exploit the efficiency of our postal services.&quot;<br /><br />Many of the marijuana and cocaine shipments to South Florida are coming from the Southwest region of the country, Rojo said, because Mexican drug dealers are crossing the border to mail their shipments.<br /><br />Nationally, intercepted shipments of marijuana in the U.S. mail have been steady, if not decreasing, since 2009. But in Florida, more shipments are being stopped.<br /><br />Nationally, there was 43,564 pounds of marijuana intercepted in the mail in 2009; 35,773 pounds confiscated last year; and 23,758 pounds confiscated through June this year, records show. In Florida, that was 2,158 pounds in 2009; 2,789 pounds last year; and 3,368 pounds through June.<br /><br />Cocaine interceptions are on the rise both nationally and in Florida, records show. Nationally, there was 506 pounds intercepted in 2009; 657 pounds last year; and 434 through June. In Florida, there was 37 pounds of intercepted in both 2009 and 2010, and 44 pounds through June.<br /><br />The packages typically contain 20-30 pounds of marijuana or a kilo or two of cocaine, Rojo said.<br /><br />As Mexican drug lords get stronger, they no longer have to rely on Colombians, who typically shipped their drugs via the Caribbean, said Jim Hall, director of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Substance Abuse at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale.<br /><br />As the quality of Mexican drugs has improved, the quantity has increased along the U.S. border, he said.<br /><br />U.S. mail statistics for Broward andPalm Beach counties were unavailable. But records for private carriers inspected by sheriff&#039;s deputies — show spikes in drug interceptions.<br /><br />The Palm Beach County Sheriff&#039;s Office reported 130 drug packages intercepted in 2009; 220 last year and 100 through June. The Sheriff&#039;s Office would not release what types of drugs were stopped.<br /><br />Broward County has seen increases mainly in cocaine and prescription pill interceptions, the Sheriff&#039;s Office said.<br /><br />In 2009, deputies intercepted 80 kilos of cocaine and 21,512 oxycodone pills; 276 kilos of cocaine and 53,819 oxy pills in 2010 and 13 kilos of cocaine and 28,057 pills through June, records show.<br /><br />Both sheriffs&#039; offices declined to be interviewed for this article, citing security issues.<br /><br />Officials of FedEx and UPS said they have security programs in place but declined to discuss what would lead them to deem a package suspicious.<br /><br />Public and private carriers, and law enforcement officers, need a warrant to open and search a package.<br /><br />&quot;We do a good job identifying suspicious packages,&quot; FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said.<br /><br />Drugs usually come tightly packed in boxes, wrapped several times in plastic. When they contain pungent marijuana, that plastic often is covered in axle grease or fabric softener sheets to disguise the smell, inspectors said.<br /><br />With the increase in drug interceptions comes an increase in drug arrests, authorities said.<br /><br />&quot;We are here to investigate and get big convictions so we discourage other people from doing it,&quot; Rojo said.<br /><br />That&#039;s what happened to Charles Clayton, 39, of North Lauderdale, who was sentenced last year to 30 years in federal prison for having a kilo of cocaine shipped to him, court documents show.<br /><br />Clayton&#039;s long criminal history contributed to his stiff sentence, Rojo said.<br /><br />U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in San Juan, Puerto Rico, intercepted a package labeled &quot;Legal Documents,&quot; coming from St. Thomas and headed to Clayton&#039;s home, court records show.<br /><br />The kilo was sent to the Postal Inspection office in Miramar and an undercover agent delivered it to Clayton.<br /><br />Disguised as a postal carrier, the undercover agent asked Clayton if the package was his. Clayton said yes, signed for it, and when he tried to take the package, he was arrested.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />sorry to hijack your thread I guess but since there is no intelligence forum to put all this shit in what else can I do ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />

Do you have any stats on the British or European situation?<br /><br />I am thinking we are going to eventually find that the % of packages lost to &#039;acts of god&#039; in the mail, is somewhat higher than the % of intercepted packages. I also have a hypothesis that the majority of drugs intercepted and destroyed are not illegal drugs, but pharmaceutical ones &#039;out of justification&#039; so to speak i.e. doctors have certain trade monopolies and would very much like to keep it that way.<br /><br />Here are the infos I&#039;ve gathered on the UK situation to date:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Royal Mail Statistics:<br /><br />115,271 post boxes<br /><br />62 million items per day.<br /><br />out of which are:<br /><br />63 million parcels per year (think this refers to anything &gt; 100 grams)<br /><br />Sauce: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010-11

But we don&#039;t want the criminals to exploit the efficiency of our postal services.&quot;<br /><br />Many of the marijuana and cocaine shipments to South Florida are coming from the Southwest region of the country, Rojo said, because Mexican drug dealers are crossing the border to mail their shipments.<br /><br />Nationally, intercepted shipments of marijuana in the U.S. mail have been steady, if not decreasing, since 2009. But in Florida, more shipments are being stopped.<br /><br />Nationally, there was 43,564 pounds of marijuana intercepted in the mail in 2009; 35,773 pounds confiscated last year; and 23,758 pounds confiscated through June this year, records show. In Florida, that was 2,158 pounds in 2009; 2,789 pounds last year; and 3,368 pounds through June.<br /><br />Cocaine interceptions are on the rise both nationally and in Florida, records show. Nationally, there was 506 pounds intercepted in 2009; 657 pounds last year; and 434 through June. In Florida, there was 37 pounds of intercepted in both 2009 and 2010, and 44 pounds through June.<br /><br />The packages typically contain 20-30 pounds of marijuana or a kilo or two of cocaine, Rojo said.<br /><br />As Mexican drug lords get stronger, they no longer have to rely on Colombians, who typically shipped their drugs via the Caribbean, said Jim Hall, director of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Substance Abuse at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale.<br /><br />As the quality of Mexican drugs has improved, the quantity has increased along the U.S. border, he said.<br /><br />U.S. mail statistics for Broward andPalm Beach counties were unavailable. But records for private carriers inspected by sheriff&#039;s deputies — show spikes in drug interceptions.<br /><br />The Palm Beach County Sheriff&#039;s Office reported 130 drug packages intercepted in 2009; 220 last year and 100 through June. The Sheriff&#039;s Office would not release what types of drugs were stopped.<br /><br />Broward County has seen increases mainly in cocaine and prescription pill interceptions, the Sheriff&#039;s Office said.<br /><br />In 2009, deputies intercepted 80 kilos of cocaine and 21,512 oxycodone pills; 276 kilos of cocaine and 53,819 oxy pills in 2010 and 13 kilos of cocaine and 28,057 pills through June, records show.<br /><br />Both sheriffs&#039; offices declined to be interviewed for this article, citing security issues.<br /><br />Officials of FedEx and UPS said they have security programs in place but declined to discuss what would lead them to deem a package suspicious.<br /><br />Public and private carriers, and law enforcement officers, need a warrant to open and search a package.<br /><br />&quot;We do a good job identifying suspicious packages,&quot; FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said.<br /><br />Drugs usually come tightly packed in boxes, wrapped several times in plastic. When they contain pungent marijuana, that plastic often is covered in axle grease or fabric softener sheets to disguise the smell, inspectors said.<br /><br />With the increase in drug interceptions comes an increase in drug arrests, authorities said.<br /><br />&quot;We are here to investigate and get big convictions so we discourage other people from doing it,&quot; Rojo said.<br /><br />That&#039;s what happened to Charles Clayton, 39, of North Lauderdale, who was sentenced last year to 30 years in federal prison for having a kilo of cocaine shipped to him, court documents show.<br /><br />Clayton&#039;s long criminal history contributed to his stiff sentence, Rojo said.<br /><br />U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in San Juan, Puerto Rico, intercepted a package labeled &quot;Legal Documents,&quot; coming from St. Thomas and headed to Clayton&#039;s home, court records show.<br /><br />The kilo was sent to the Postal Inspection office in Miramar and an undercover agent delivered it to Clayton.<br /><br />Disguised as a postal carrier, the undercover agent asked Clayton if the package was his. Clayton said yes, signed for it, and when he tried to take the package, he was arrested.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />sorry to hijack your thread I guess but since there is no intelligence forum to put all this shit in what else can I do ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 <br /><br />I wish there was an intelligence forum as well because it is definitely different than &quot;security.&quot;

The DEA are not going to depend on numbers they discovered on an online forum. They are going to have to research them themselves with test packages sent throughout the mail. &quot;Hurr Durr, Kingpin Pine said the numbers are X, Y and Z, millord&quot;.<br /><br />In fact, I think you should assume the DEA have already sent hundreds of packages throughout the mail system with substances that would ID for cocaine et al, even though they are synthetic i.e. not drugs, just similar chemical structure to them. They would do this in order to ascertain the probabilities for the interception rates for different kinds of packages, which would be useful intelligence. If they haven&#039;t already done this, then they are as thick as fuck, which seems rather unlikely.<br /><br />They can do a far better data analysis because they can coordinate with the Postal Inspectors directly.<br /><br />No, this data gathering exercise is for us, the buyers and sellers of the Silk Road. Knowing the numbers, is a big part of the Game in any business. It allows you to work out your margin of safety, the profitability of your potential business model, and the kinds of risks that buyers are realistically taking and lots of other useful stuff. Even rough averages such as this one are critical to consumer confidence.<br /><br />Intelligence from *already open data sources* cannot compromise the Silk Road. As long as identity anonymity is respected, more knowledge helps us, not harms us. In fact, this kind of information helps us a lot lot more than the DEA because the biggest obstacle to global implementation of a decentralized drug trafficking service is confidence.<br /><br />The word Credit comes from the Latin &#039;credo&#039;, which means trust or confidence. The entire capitalist system ultimately runs off confidence or trust. Not naive trust, not faith, but trust established through contracts and deals i.e. reciprocal relationships and reprisals for uncooperative behavior.<br /><br />More transparency = more intelligence = more customers = more resilient marketplace.<br /><br />Edit: The business environment today as I see it:<br />Most people still assume, subconsciously almost, that each and every piece of mail gets analyzed. When that myth is fully dispelled with the new up and coming vertically integrated business strategies by sellers on the Silk Road and Black Market Reloaded and direct sales from the manufacture/farming of drugs to the consumers directly, it&#039;s curtains for the DEA, not to mention each and every drug cartels who doesn&#039;t have a handle on the source of their product.

My strongest drugs for personal use are chocolate and coffee. I believe it&#039;s up to an individual to make decisions for themselves for good or for ill. The price of freedom is individual responsibility. As far as I can see, a sizable majority of drugs are relatively benign providing sensible precautions, the kind you&#039;d take with any drug, are taken. e.g. having a accurate scales to weigh quantity, a drug testing kits for your purchases, knowing the half-life of the drug etc. <br /><br />What I sell is human catnip, a high margin commodity. And I can assure you the quality is as high as I can get it, no shortcuts have been take in the production or processing, and it&#039;s free from contaminants, cutting and other bulk up bullshit. There is &#039;selfishness&#039; and then there is &#039;self interest&#039;. It&#039;s the difference between the short term and the long term.

				Update: <br /><br />Global Delivery Success Rate*: 88.33%<br /><br />Incidentally, my research shows that the general drug market has a much worst ratio for mail interceptions. Our batting average is at the very least four to five times better than theirs. This is partly because we&#039;re expert &quot;reverse package profile engineers&quot; and partly because our low volume mass mailing business model is simply a more successful one. If anybody&#039;s shipping the average seizure amounts that are intercepted in the USA, which is 1 kilo of cocaine and severals pounds of weed, then you should probably resign from SR for being an epic moron. Patience, not impulsivity is the key here! I take it most of us have heard the story about the father and son bulls sitting on a hill watching the cows? <br /><br />*henceforth GDSR or just generic DSR, and I&#039;ll update for specific countries if only I get enough data. Imagine we&#039;ll mostly get UK and USA respondents and so they will be the most accurate averages, but even so it means something. Post procedures the world over are pretty much the same with some tweaks. I&#039;ll do domestic/international breakdowns if there&#039;s enough data too. <br /><br />However this is the preliminarily investigation (haha) into the subject, and we&#039;ll setup a proper survey as detailed as it gets when this is over. It&#039;s important to get a rough idea first. Then maybe we can sticky it and view updates of it each month in graphical form or something should the mods see fit.<br /><br />Yeah, obviously some of the packages not arriving is due to scammers. At least 50% is probably just that. However I think we should assume the worst case scenario and in any case it&#039;s what geeks call the &#039;throughput&#039;, what actually comes out of SR that matters, rather than the bandwidth/hypothetical outcome.

				I am not sure how many packages I have over the years. If I am allowed to make a rough estimate, I would say<br /><br />international: 8<br />domestic: 30<br /><br />I know of at least one package (to a friend) that wasn&#039;t intercepted per-se but was apparently ripped open and had the contents stolen by mail sorters.

				Update:<br /><br />DSR: 96.91%<br /><br />583 out of 565 packages received. <br /><br />Thanks for the data, especially anarcho47! . You fellows give me more and I&#039;ll plug it into my spreadsheet. A sample of 1000 packages would be nice.<br /><br />I think at this stage we are able to make some comments with a fair degree of scientific validity.<br /><br />1. The idea each and every package is analyzed by an omnipotent postal service is utter, utter bunk of the highest order.<br />2. The currently missing 3.09% can be interpreted as:<br /><br />A: Scammer buyers.<br />B: Mail interceptions by inspectors.<br />C: Lost/stolen mail.<br /><br />It appears to me that to close the gap to 99%, the following would have the greatest impact on DSR:<br /><br />- seller education on reverse package profile engineering.<br />- some method to detect or deter buyer scammers. Could be as simple as ensuring the first 5 packages have to finalize early (with new sellers suffering a similar restriction but in reverse).<br /><br />I mean, if we can reasonably claim that 1 in a 100 packages get through, then imagine the impact on sales!<br />It&#039;s not (just) about getting a little extra profit from sales, it&#039;s also about buyer confidence and reputation of SR.

				By the way, I came across some most amusing information while doing my research. I think it&#039;s some comfort to our professional vendors dealing in high volumes.<br /><br />- A 2009 study showed that at least 90% of US dollar bills have cocaine residues on them, and some of the tests showed that more than 95% of the cash in circulation is cocaine- contaminated.<br /><br />- People send cash through the post all the time despite being told it&#039;s a stupid idea by the postal service. Especially at Christmas time.<br /><br />Putting two and two together, this will mean:<br /><br />Using electronic noses for drug detection systems to stop each and every package is actually impossible. <br /><br />Yes, you can use a electronic nose for drug residue detection.<br />Yes, in theory they are able to detect up to 1 billionth of a gram of cocaine or other drug.<br /><br />But in practice probably more people send cash through the post in the world, than use SR&#039;s services (those statistics don&#039;t differ much between Europe and America). As a result, the sensitivity of the electronic drug detection mechanisms has to be quite low or they would have to stop the mail every couple of seconds.<br /><br />Obviously this doesn&#039;t mean you should stop vacuum packing and using rubbing alcohol to get rid of drug residues, but it certainly makes sure that LEO is put back in his box. :P

The key thing, is to coordinate such efforts for maximum impact. We could keep up such an attack for months at next to no affect on our bottom line, I&#039;m pretty sure the CEOs will bend to the bottom line once they see the numbers. Postal inspection is always subject to economic realities, and this definitely hits them where it hurts, especially since they wear throughput rate of post as a badge of honor.<br /><br />As for your comment on my comment, the answer is no. I was not implying some snooty customer derision or contempt to drug users. My point was that this is a business like any other business. I don&#039;t have to smoke or inject all my products before I sell them. They do however, go through an extremely rigorous testing regime and quality control process that I consulted with industry experts over several months to achieve. Getting paid three times the yearly salary of my peers within a single week has a tendency to focus the mind on ROI and everything to do with it.<br /><br />The days of having to smoke a batch with the local gang to prove you&#039;re legit are long gone, today drug manufacture, drug agronomy, drug distribution are as corporate as Starbucks and just as ubiquitous. The different with the Silk Road, is that the payment mechanism has finally caught up with the market.<br /><br />Capitalism &lt;3<br /><br />Also, on the dead drop network, there&#039;s a fellow thinking about similar ideas called Project Zanzibar here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11112.msg102309#msg102309

				We really need to organize the people on SR to start doing things like this, throwing in a bit of coke with all the other mail at a bunch of blue boxes. If enough people do this it will seriously hurt their ability to use not only electronic noses, but real drug dog noses. Turn their sensitivity against them to make them hit on everything :). After all a hit is a hit as far as a drug dog goes anyway, an electronic nose can probably filter out noise a little better though.

				Orders: roughly 10<br /><br />Received: 9<br /><br />9/10 orders were domestic, one from Canada.<br /><br />Only one I didn&#039;t receive was my first order for MDMA from Calistoner back when he ripped and dipped dozens for domestic molly.<br /><br />Ever since then I try to stick to the big guns (top 5 sellers). Twice I&#039;ve used smaller time guys - top 30ish but 100% (RECENT!) feedback with recent positive chatter on the forums.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been happy with them as well, but I only risk ordering from small time guys if it&#039;s something that doesn&#039;t move in huge volume (psy&#039;s) so they never get a chance to get huge amounts of feedback ratings.

				Member for 4 or 5 months now and have accumulated **looks embarassed** 17 purchases, all received in the USA, from Netherlands, Germany, Spain, U.S., and Canada. I&#039;m gonna make another purchase from the Netherlands but am not ordering anything I can&#039;t bear to have seized by U.S. customs.<br /><br />1. 17 sent<br />2. 17 arrived.<br />3. Eastern U.S.<br /><br />I always order some books and paper materials or trinkets from ebay and amazon (guitar strings, drug paraphernalia, etc.) just after my SR orders ship. I get some model airplane stuff from Hong Kong so packages with foreign languages on them don&#039;t surprise the mail carrier. I also subscribe to a lot of (free) trade journals so the carrier has a lot of stuff to sort through.<br /><br />If some LE agency has enough manpower to start a file based on this info just to keep me from smoking cannabis products, then my tax dollars are being wasted even worse than I thought.<br /><br />I registered different user names on SR and the forums in case security was lax on the forums and they got hacked. So far, this hasn&#039;t caused any problems as a buyer and I don&#039;t anticipate becoming a seller.<br /><br />

				Personally I believe the delivery rate should be increased by 1-2%. Scammers who say their packages have not arrived must be accounted for. We know they exist, we know they&#039;re frequent, and often there&#039;s no way of telling if they are lying or not. We can consider the scammers, the margin of error, in our whole percentage.

Interception.<br />2. Scammer Buyers pretending they didn&#039;t receive package.<br />3. Lost mail (more likely than regular post due to Buyers goofing around with the address and name).<br />4. Packages arriving late, such that the buyer reasonably could say the package didn&#039;t arrive and has no incentive to update feedback status. Similar to (2), but unintentional.<br /><br />The only way I can think of to reasonably separate those options from each other is to put electronic tracking devices with G.P.S capability. We also need a electronic device which detects the package being opened (yes, this is possible via photosensitive electronic devices) and sends us a timestamp to a busy open location online e.g. google groups/usenet etc<br /><br />To prevent LEO using the new package profile, we&#039;d need to send all packages simultaneously.<br /><br />Now, all of that is possible, and would allow us to work out exactly how many packages per 1000 get intercepted.<br /><br />The problem is a matter of funding, coordination and a significant level of technical expertise. Also the attention that such a sophisticated setup would attract. The keyword here is funding, we&#039;d need ~200k to make that work. Product has to be real remember. Probably not worth it at this moment, until the interception rate results in losses above 400k a quarter. Right now it&#039;s simply more economical to lose the occasional package.

				Pine, first let me commend you for your effort and for your professionalism.&nbsp; As an avid yet responsible drug user for all of my adult life, I have come to appreciate the difference between business people who sell the commodity of drugs and the idiots who merely sling shit to make a buck, scamming at every opportunity because they are too ignorant to employ proven business models.<br /><br />Silk Road makes it easy to spot the difference.<br /><br />5 packages ordered.<br />3 were US to US<br />1 was CA to US<br />1 was France to US<br /><br />All were received without incident.<br /><br />I agree with others that a large percentage of unsuccessful transactions are due to hanky panky on the part of the buyer, or an oversight on the part of the vendor...&nbsp; These packages are each nothing more than one out hundreds of millions of pieces of mail handled daily.<br /><br />Think about these numbers for a moment.&nbsp; If they&#039;ve already been posted, I apologize, but according to the USPS:<br /><br />203 billion - total number of mail pieces processed in 2008.<br /><br />That breaks down to:<br /><br />3.9&nbsp; billion - average number of mail pieces processed per week in the same year.<br />556 million - average number of mail pieces processed per day in the same year<br /><br />That&#039;s 23,173,515 pieces of mail per hour.&nbsp; Assuming the post office works 24/7, which it does not.<br /><br />Even acknowledging that the post office has seen a decline in mail volume over the past few years...&nbsp; Well, I&#039;ll take those odds.<br /><br />

				This thread is a surprise. Now I don&#039;t know how solid overall this sample size is as control group for the total number of items shipped, but seriously, over 97%...WOW.<br /><br />I would have thought just inefficiencies in the international mail system by themselves would cause a lesser rate than that. Let alone popped shipments due to badly masked nature of the mailpiece etc.<br /><br />I think this may alleviate some of my paranoid tendencies :)

				Thanks to everybody who participated in our survey. <br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Final Update:<br /><br />DSR: 97.5173783515%<br /><br />Results: 982 out of 1007 packages arrived without incident.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />If you prefer rounded down numbers for ease of remembering them:<br /><br />DSR: 97.50%<br /><br />975 out of 1000 packages.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Comment:<br /><br />The vast majority of packages had the USA as a destination from at least 12 different countries. The Silk Road is pretty cosmopolitan, as befits the global capitalist enterprise that it is becoming. It&#039;s very similar to the beginning of Facebook, Ebay and Amazon, where they started in the States and then quickly spread to Europe and then the World.<br /><br />No matter how well known the Silk Road becomes, we should not forget this is a war. Because that is how the DEA views you, as enemy combatants. They are savage to those who attempt to pacify them. They are out of control and regularly break their own rules, especially by venturing into extralegal semantics of the sort that brought us that weal on the face of America, Guantanamo Bay. If you know their South American tactics, then you are already aware of their innate capacity for violence. This stopped being about justice a long long time ago, it is only about control in the way a union is a parasite on the jugular of a corporation. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard of the &quot;long arm of the law&quot;. Well, they are about to hear about the invisible hand of the market because we&#039;re going to throttle them without shedding a drop of blood. And if they turn this cold war hot, then they&#039;ll quickly find out that not every libertarian is advocate of the non-aggression principal and they are completely outnumbered.<br /><br /><br />

				The only problem I see is that all the domestic orders which are usually close to 100% are going to skew the international numbers. If you really wanted to get in depth you could do Country A to Country B, Country A to Country C and so forth etc but that would be a huge amount of effort so probably not worth bothering.

				Maybe we should do a inside the states stats. If packages that are sent from the states to the states, that the stats should be close to 100 percent of not 100 percent. I think most of the packages that dont make it are either stolen by the postman or the buyer is not telling the truth about receiving the product.

				Re: Rocketdog and TalkingHead on Unions.<br /><br />Unions, have contributed not one thing, not a single iota, not a solitary modicum of improvement to the human condition and the worker&#039;s salaries.<br /><br />Unions, are a mirage. They are much like politicians taking the credit for improvements they had nothing to do with.<br /><br />Survey after survey, economic analysis after economic analysis shows that they don&#039;t contribute *anything* to anybody. <br /><br />Not even serious economists on the left believe Unions contribute to society. When you work out how wealth is actually generated in society, you&#039;ll understand why. It is really basic Econ 101. The level of wages raises when the division of labor expands. A bunch of people bitching, doesn&#039;t have an iota of impact on the economy. The economy is driven by actions, not words.<br /><br />The function of unions is about as mythological as fire breathing dragons. They are a pernicious lie. The scientific evidence for this is simply overwhelming.<br /><br />Read the book: Economics In One Lesson, if you&#039;re interested in understanding why unions exist.<br /><br />

				Yeah Hazlitt. Ayn Rand. Unregulated free markets. Pay and treat workers however you like, profits before people. Employers firing workers by the millions so now everyone is afraid to assert themselves because the next poor shlub who is even more desperate will be very happy to take that job. But hey, survival of the fittest, no government oversight. It&#039;s all good, right? You conservatives and libertarians need to take a look around you and see the human cost of these ideas. <br /><br />Wow, the attitude towards unions is rather astounding, and I am not saying that unions aren&#039;t deeply flawed in some ways. But basic wage standards, job safety, child labor laws, collective bargaining agreements and so much more would not exist if it wasn&#039;t for working people fighting and dying (oh wait, &quot;bitching&quot;) for their basic rights against corporations whose only goal is to maximize their profits at whatever cost. Again, why do you think so many people are doing their best to destroy them? <br /><br />&quot;Not even serious economists on the left believe Unions contribute to society.&quot; <br /><br />Oh really? Paul Krugman, NY Times, Dec. 24, 2007:<br /><br />&quot;Once upon a time, back when America had a strong middle class, it also had a strong union movement.<br /><br />These two facts were connected. Unions negotiated good wages and benefits for their workers, gains that often ended up being matched even by nonunion employers. They also provided an important counterbalance to the political influence of corporations and the economic elite.<br /><br />Today, however, the American union movement is a shadow of its former self, except among government workers. In 1973, almost a quarter of private-sector employees were union members, but last year the figure was down to a mere 7.4 percent.<br /><br />It’s often assumed that the U.S. labor movement died a natural death, that it was made obsolete by globalization and technological change. But what really happened is that beginning in the 1970s, corporate America, which had previously had a largely cooperative relationship with unions, in effect declared war on organized labor.<br /><br />Don’t take my word for it; read Business Week, which published an article in 2002 titled “How Wal-Mart Keeps Unions at Bay.” The article explained that “over the past two decades, Corporate America has perfected its ability to fend off labor groups.” It then described the tactics — some legal, some illegal, all involving a healthy dose of intimidation — that Wal-Mart and other giant firms use to block organizing drives.<br /><br />These hardball tactics have been enabled by a political environment that has been deeply hostile to organized labor, both because politicians favored employers’ interests and because conservatives sought to weaken the Democratic Party. “We’re going to crush labor as a political entity,” Grover Norquist, the anti-tax activist, once declared.&quot;<br /><br />And it&#039;s only gotten worse. Look, I&#039;m just a worker bee but I know for a fact that if my colleagues and I weren&#039;t organized, the corporations we work for would basically be able to dictate whatever they wanted in terms of work hours in a day, meal breaks and so much more. But hey, if I don&#039;t like the little dribbles that they deign to hand down to me in their infinite corporate wisdom and generosity I can just get any other job I want, right?

Deadly serious. I don&#039;t remember advocating completely unregulated free markets recently, I&#039;m not an anarchist. I simply happen to agree with anarcho47 most of the time because from reading his historical posts it is clear that he&#039;s actually gone and read the literature and history of economy. So go attack a strawman if you want to, because you must really be talking to somebody else entirely. <br /><br />Economics by Paul Samuelson for example. Millions of economists have studied that book. He&#039;s not exactly Ayn Rand. This is not an argument because there isn&#039;t really two sides to this. There are just some things are just scientifically shown to be true and others are not. When you&#039;ve read it, then we can have some frame of reference instead of these vaguely general accusations.<br /><br />Honestly, the kind of mistakes people make in these discussions are not esoteric aspects of economics open to debate, but things which have been established as being true time and time again for literally centuries. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11731.msg121281#msg121281">Quote from: TalkingHead on February 21, 2012, 09:12 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Not even serious economists on the left believe Unions contribute to society.&quot; <br /><br />Oh really?

An example of this would be that he was loudly advocating the generation of a housing bubble in the early part of the last decade around the dot com era. So, his track record on political economy, is ah, somewhat sketchy to say the least.<br /><br />His actual economics, if you study them, are probably not at all what you imagine them to be.<br /><br />A quote from the Bible is appropriate for what Krugman is.

				If inflate their member&#039;s wages you mean fight for a basic living wage against all corporate desires then I agree with you. Yes, when people get paid more, companies pass along the higher costs which winds up costing everyone. I get that idea. But does that mean that workers should just accept whatever is offered? I guess maybe I feel that profits shouldn&#039;t be the be all consuming goal that they seem to be. And yes &quot;profits before people&quot; is a cliche, but for a reason. But I guess it&#039;s better to overpay corporate CEOs rather than have a more equitable pay structure that shares all of labor&#039;s efforts.<br /><br />Look, the quote from Timothy could apply to both of us, I guess. To dismiss all of my arguments by claiming some kind of scientific basis for your beliefs is spurious at best since, when it comes to economic theories, everyone has theirs - it&#039;s not really a hard science now, is it? I also believe that the truth/best course, etc. usually lies somewhere between the poles.<br /><br />You guys all make some good points but I still believe the end result of following many of those ideas unreservedly (not saying that&#039;s what you guys are doing) can be a whole lot of human suffering. <br /><br />Anyway, I love that we can have this kind of discussion in this wonderful SR community. And sorry for hijacking this thread.<br /><br />So Pine, how are those statistics coming? When I get to my mailbox today, hopefully I&#039;ll be 14 for 14, all domestic US.

				TalkingHead, what do you think actually determines your salary? <br /><br />-- Slightly different topic --<br /><br />P.S. On the CEO compensation issue, I&#039;m in complete agreement it&#039;s outrageous. It&#039;s an obvious problem, and a small one in the grand scheme of things, but nonetheless it&#039;s still a problem.<br /><br />You know why it occurred? It wasn&#039;t always this way, as I&#039;m sure Krugman will tell you in some op-ed. Used to be that the maximum salary of a CEO in America was about 25 to 50x the salary of the lowest paid employee. Today it is 250x that.<br /><br />The reason though, is interesting. It&#039;s because of the principal agent problem in economics. Mis-directed self interest. Basically the people who own companies publicly and privately are shareholders, and they are what has changed.<br /><br />Previously, the majority of shareholders at the start of the 20th century were individuals like you and I. Today, the majority of shareholders are institutions like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds etc. <br /><br />Now, they almost never exercise their voting rights to force down CEO pay. This is partly because they know the CEOs personally and they will get &#039;deals&#039; in which the CEO sells out his or her own company if they STFU. Other times it is simply because of paperwork, there is simply too much of it to control all those companies directly and vote on everything. Too much to read! Some funds have tens of thousands of constituents, they can&#039;t know them all.<br /><br />So, essentially a lack of shareholder activism, a lack of individual shareholders is what has caused the problem. They can vote with their feet, but there are too few of them in the stock market for them to be noticed. <br /><br />If most investors were fundamental investors, or value investors, this problem wouldn&#039;t exist. Eventually it&#039;ll work itself out, it&#039;s doing that at the moment in fact. More institutional funds are taking more responsibility, trying to setup automatic voting networks etc. But it&#039;ll take a while for the system to adjust, perhaps a decade or two. True improvement in economies moves slowly, at a sure but snail like pace.<br /><br />On the other hand, large institutional funds are often reliable sources of capital for corporations that would be difficult to rally from millions of investors. So there&#039;s an upside and a downside.

				Human beings are self-interested and that is a constant.&nbsp; You can play around at the edges but that&#039;s how it works, and it is not a bad thing.<br /><br />The idea is that consumers, who are able to withhold their claim to resources (money) and force bankruptcy and ruin on businesses who do bad things, are a more powerful force (when coupled with actual property rights for the individual) than a small group of men and women who have the license to enforce mandates with a monopoly on violence.&nbsp; You wonder why it is that corporations write the regulations and game the system to benefit their business.&nbsp; It&#039;s simple - it&#039;s more cost effective to be self-interested and pay off a group of 100 or 200 people (who can shut down your competitors and write the mandates so that they favor you) than it is to have to slave and bleed to serve your customers so that they don&#039;t choose someone else of their own volition.<br /><br />All REAL economics, as a science, recognize humanity for what it is.&nbsp; Believing that some group of people with guns and mandates are going to make the world this beautiful place is a fantasy that shouldn&#039;t exist in a human mind beyond the age of ten.....&nbsp; It isn&#039;t corporations and greedy businessmen who committed the 100 million or so murders/genocides of the 20th century.....&nbsp; You need to understand who your enemy is, and it&#039;s not greed.&nbsp; It&#039;s violence.&nbsp; And corporations can only be violent if they have a government to be violent for them.

You&#039;re correct that there isn&#039;t 1 system to rule them all. But it&#039;s really about &#039;levels&#039;. Larger economies generate more complex superstructures in a kind of feedback loop over time in the spheres of government and markets. Like when we were hunter/gatherers, we didn&#039;t exactly need a government, because there was no centralization of anything. But when you develop private property rights, you require central monopolies on power to protect them, and that&#039;s why governments came into existence. Since 400 years ago. Before then, there were no governments. You can laugh, but it is true. The concept of a nation state is an entirely new concept on the world scene. Previously you had a bunch of guys with big knifes that took most of your stuff, to protect you from a smaller bunch of guys with big knifes that would take all your staff. i.e. feudalism.<br /><br />A western government would be completely retarded to have in Central Africa. They don&#039;t have the markets to support such an entity. You truly have no idea how small the African economy is. It&#039;s pathetic.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11731.msg122740#msg122740">Quote from: johnwholesome on February 22, 2012, 10:00 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Tell me again, before the unions, what was the country again where the national guard had to protect workers from corporate goons with clubs and tire irons?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No idea.

				--------------------------------------<br />Resurrection Update:<br /><br />DSR: 96.484375%<br /><br />Results: 1729 out of 1792 packages arrived without incident.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Comment:<br /><br />This new figure includes data from Ahoyhoy&#039;s thread [http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31164.0]. It is interesting to note that Ahoyhoy&#039;s respondents had at least twice as many bad packages as the respondents in this thread. This could be psychological due to the differing titles of our threads or due to the different timing of the polls. When there is some ambiguity in expressing a positive/negative figure, I interpret it negatively in order to make the estimate more conservative. The 63 &#039;bad packages&#039; are ones that have either been lost, had to be refunded, scams, customs interceptions, pretty much anything that isn&#039;t a straight forward successful delivery from A to B. <br /><br />I know people are interested in this data at the resolution of specific countries, but if we&#039;re going to do that then you guys ideally need to make an alt forum a/c in order to post the specifics of your statistics. I mean we want the data, but we don&#039;t care about who it comes from specifically, let&#039;s not make this thread into a potential open source SR user geo-coord data mining effort for LEA. Generic statements about locations please, even behind an alt.<br /><br />Anyway, the main result remains the same, the DSR remains very high despite a ~1% fall and many customers have never experienced a mishap. It is clear that some people are being more selective than others about their choice of vendors.<br /><br />Finally: If you give your address to a vendor, ensure that it is PGP encrypted with the vendor&#039;s public key first. If they don&#039;t use PGP, tell them to go fuck themselves. If you are a customer and you are serious, you use PGP to encrypt your address. DPR gives you that advice. Pine gives you that advice. All the moderators and forum members of any sizable post count give you that advice. So maybe it&#039;s not an optional extra just because you don&#039;t see a tool for doing it on the main site (this is only because that isn&#039;t possible without compromising the point of using PGP). Learn how to do this at my other thread, it&#039;s the first link in my signature.<br />

Make clear what &#039;Domestic&#039; means, because this is not exactly silkroad.com here, the number of international ex-USA SR users is not small, I&#039;m not even certain the US nationality is the majority although it may be.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The reason why this thread works is because the data are a genuine public good. It benefits toe-in-the-water SR customers hugely to know the DSR is this high, it destroys the border watch propaganda the Australian Customs and others propagate. It destroys the illusion of State omniscience, its supposed invincibility.

				Not a buyer but a vendor from EU.<br />I think what is important besides receiving the goods is the way the vendor (with so much experience)knows about the different locations the orders are shipped to.<br />Difficult countries???<br />I have all!! my Aussie orders arrived. Same as New Zealand and Asia<br />Lost one (of about 20 or so) in Scandinavia (most vendors will not ship to there).<br />But there was a time that many were lost in US.<br />Then a customer told me they lost so many letters/packages that it was just to absurd and they, the &#039;&#039;top&#039;&#039; did not take that anymore.<br />They installed camera&#039;s everywhere.<br />Well, do not know about that system but now for over a month all, about 90 (but 2)!!! arrived. Some even in 4 to 5 days EU/ South US or Canada.<br />I do not give my sellers name so it is not an advertisement for my goods. Just plain honest.<br /><br />So the question is good of course, how many did or did not make it but when you have no clue why.....what&#039;s the use asking. <br />Again ...the outcome &#039;&#039;in general 80% makes it&#039;&#039; yes....and??<br /><br />Better get warnings from the staff/SR admin to the vendors (if possible of course) like the Pangaes action from Interpol some time ago.<br />In 80 ! countries very very strict customs control for drugs in the mail. I think it was for a week or so.<br />If I had known I would have never shipped the orders that I did.<br />Everybody lost so many packages.<br />Anyway....just my 2 cents <br /><br /><br />

				So far I&#039;ve had a perfect success rate as far as receiving packages that were sent. I have two packages in transit right now though that might&#039;ve gotten fucked (eh, happens sooner or later), I&#039;ll update when those are resolved.<br /><br />1. 31<br />2. 31<br />3. Most from US to east US, 4 from Germany to east US, 2 from UK and 2 from Canada.<br /><br /><br />(Oh, I don&#039;t know if this has any bearing, but these aren&#039;t 31 different vendors, I often buy from the same vendor multiple times)

				1.&nbsp; 42<br />2.&nbsp; 41<br />3.&nbsp; USA<br /><br />I should say that i have reason to strongly suspect that the package i never received was never actually sent.&nbsp; it was from a superstar vendor who was in the middle of a move when i ordered.&nbsp; he gave me a wicked discount for no reason other than i didn&#039;t have enough money so i FE&#039;d.&nbsp; package never came so he reshipped 250% of my original order.&nbsp; he said he &quot;thought he sent me a package&quot; but couldn&#039;t find the DCN since he was moving.&nbsp; i think he just got stoned and forgot, but i was happy waiting a few weeks for the best deal of my life :) then i paid him back for the discount he originally gave me.<br /><br />so thats my only SR fail story
