				This seems like a fairly uncommon psychoactive. It is uncontrolled in a lot of countries. So no problems with shipping.<br /><br />Still there is so little of in on SR.<br />I know plenty of people now who like it. Kind of like speed, but with less side effects/hangover.<br /><br />At the moment √ç&#039;m offering the cheapest mpa. 1g for 1.6btc. If anybody knows off anybody selling for lower please let me know. But I don&#039;t think so (including shipping)&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />What are your experiences with it?

				Nobody has any experience with it?<br /><br />Methiopropamine is a stimulant chemically related to methamphetamine. Though it was first synthesized in 1942, it wasn&#039;t until it began being sold online in late 2010 that it saw much recreational use. It has a very short history of human use and little is known about potential health risks or benefits.<br /><br />EFFECTS LIST<br />POSITIVE: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mild euphoria<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Increased alertness, energy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sexual arousal<br /><br />NEUTRAL: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Increased heart rate<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Loss of appetite<br /><br />General Effects Notes<br />The effects of methiopropamine are usually compared to methamphetamine, but there are too few experience reports with reliably sourced material to say much else with confidence. Described by some as a fairly clean stimulant effect at lower dosages. Negative side effects and difficult come-down period are significantly worse with higher doses and/or redosing multiple times.<br /><br />Methiopropamine Dosages<br />Insufflated: ( very tentative )<br />Threshold: ~5 mg<br />Light: 5 - 15 mg<br />Common: 20 - 40 mg<br />Strong: 40 - 60+ mg<br /><br />Methiopropamine Dosages<br />Oral: ( very tentative )<br />Threshold: 10 mg<br />Light: 20 - 30 mg<br />Common: 40 - 50 mg<br />Strong: 50+ mg<br /><br />Methiopropamine Duration<br />Insufflated: ( very tentative )<br />Total Duration: 2 - 4 hrs<br />Onset: 5 - 10 mins<br />Coming Up: 5 - 10 mins<br />Plateau: 30 - 60 mins<br />Coming Down: 30 - 120 mins<br />After Effects: 8 - 18 hrs<br />

				Ok, this is strange...<br />Since this was already strange, I listed samples.<br />Now I made them a lot cheaper. 0.2btc. .25g will be about 4 strong doses.<br /><br />Only going to give away 2 samples for that price though. It&#039;s pricey stuff&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/8ba2613944

				Got some of this off the clearnet as its unrestricted where I am. Not had the chance or inclination to try it yet though.<br /><br />Whats your experience of it Virmo, Erowid&#039;s useful but it&#039;d be interesting to hear a firsthand opinion.

				Actually the effect list is pretty accurate.<br />I&#039;m not sure about their dosages. But they say that they are tentative anyway. <br /><br />This is how it is for me with 60mg+ or a redose within half an hour or an hour:<br /><br />EFFECTS LIST<br />POSITIVE:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mild euphoria&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CHECK<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Increased alertness, energy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CHECK<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sexual arousal&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CHECK (but not always and not very much. Nothing compared to GHB though).<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Increased heart rate&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not really<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Loss of appetite&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little bit<br /><br />Oh I notice I didn&#039;t list the negative effects. Not sure anymore if erowid listed them.<br />One negative thing is that taking a piss becomes more difficult. Same as with mdma and/or speed.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s pretty neat stuff. Not as intense as high quality speed. Duration is shorter so I can sleep normally. No hangover (atleast for me). <br />Like a child of amfetamine ;)<br /><br />
