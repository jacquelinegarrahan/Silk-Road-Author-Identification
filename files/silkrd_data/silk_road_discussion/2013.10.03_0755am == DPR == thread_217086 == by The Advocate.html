				Even if he is, there&#039;s no way in hell the money they seized is his entire fund. He&#039;ll have multiple bitcoin wallets stored on various servers... he&#039;ll have a few cool million squirrelled away I&#039;m sure ;-)

Furthermore, the major piece of evidence which links the user &quot;altoid&quot; to the personal gmail address of the man in custody is such an amateur mistake, it&#039;s even harder to believe that would be either incarnation of DPR. Correspondingly, the slip-up of the user &quot;Frosty&quot; posting under a pseudonym linked to the personal gmail address is just embarrassing. If it truly is/was DPR, it&#039;s a miracle he made it this far. In contrast, I could accept DPR being complacent enough to administer from a local cafe. However, to think he shares accommodation with flatmates who are unaware of his identity is a struggle to accept. It&#039;s a tough one to decide.

				We&#039;re just going to have to hold our breath and wait for the trial. He said he couldn&#039;t afford a lawyer but that good just be an obvious way of still hiding his stash. I&#039;d like to think he had a way of laundering some money. Like setting up another e-business or something but we haven&#039;t heard anything so I don&#039;t know. I have a weird hopeful feeling that he&#039;d be found not guilty or get off because of some TOR technicality or a smart jury. <br /><br />Look at George Zimmerman, many people in this country wanted his head on a platter and he got found not guilty.

				Ross does not need help. He has almost unlimited financials, but does not want to access them for fear they will be seized, his partners will soon funnel laundered money into extra legal defense, you will see =P
