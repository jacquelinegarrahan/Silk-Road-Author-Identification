				Hello Roadies,<br /><br />I am new to this Silk endeavor and I am pretty excited about its possibilities.&nbsp; I have everything I need (BitCoins were more of a pain in the ass than expected), but there is still one issue.&nbsp; From what I have gathered on this forum, it seems like the best choice to use your real name and address (act like an innocent person), but I have a roommate.&nbsp; If I told this roommate that I was going to be buying some sketchy stuff online and not to sign for anything, we could probably both better avoid being arrested, but then they&#039;d just flip out.&nbsp; Or I could just order the materials, assume nothing will happen to them and when the goods come, I can discreetly hide them in my room and only I know.&nbsp; But there&#039;s always that risk that Mr. Roomie could sign for it and it&#039;d be bad news bears.<br /><br />Any advice?&nbsp; Anyone?&nbsp; Should I get a PO Box?

				Just so you know, your package has a 97.51% chance of making it.<br /><br />If you choose to buy from well regarded vendors, (high ratings, good feedback threads on forums), then it&#039;s even higher.

				That&#039;s pretty much what I&#039;ve been hearing.&nbsp; Plus, if I tell my roommate then I feel like they can plead ignorance.&nbsp; The people who have been saying it&#039;s safer than the street are making me feel better because I have known very few people to be busted in real life.&nbsp;

				Why would you order something that would require a signature? And why would you sell yourself out to your roommate?<br /><br />I suggest you do more research in the forums before placing your first order. <br />

				Sellers rarely post items that require a signature, so worrying about it is pointless.

				what pine says......<br /><br />The numbers are in your favor.......so far.....who knows what the future holds.<br /><br />For now you&#039;re pretty safe if you do your homework. Check out the vendor, read the forums, reviews in particular. If you are not entirely sure order domestic, nothing that crosses borders.

				If the numbers are in my favor then that will most likely be my primary safe haven.<br /><br />I would never order something that requires a signature.<br /><br />Worrying about signatures is just a precaution for controlled deliveries/seized packages.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not like it matters anyways, I am past the point of no return haha I already shelled serious bucks into BitCoins.&nbsp;

				Just tell your roommate you are expecting a delivery. Let em know the package is important, and just that if someone asks for a signature tell him you want to sign for it yourself given its significance, and just ask em not to sign for you EVER on any packages in the future. Tell him just to say you arent there, hes not supposed to sign for you since you want to accept the package directly into your possession, and will arrange to pick up the package.<br /><br />Really unless you are ordering a ridiculous amount of goods, the risk of a controlled delivery is relatively small.<br /><br />Be prepared for some anxiety after that first order while waiting for it to arrive :)
