				Mine is probably 50-100.&nbsp; I spend more than that but most is for resale.&nbsp; I have a side question.&nbsp; Out of the people who spend a lot ($500+) per month.&nbsp; What in the hell are you spending it on?&nbsp; I might find out some fun things I am unaware of.&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D

				$150 - $200 at the prices I pay. Mainly weed and amphetamine.<br />If I bought amphetamine off the streets here, I&#039;d be spending $500 a month+ on it (it&#039;s $500 / gram in Australia), but thanks to Silk Road i can now get a gram for under $30.

				More than I&#039;d probably care to admit to :x&nbsp; Definitely in the top range there.<br /><br />Just green, nothing harder, but it&#039;s worth getting a nice bag a few times a month.

				I&#039;m probably close to the 500$ range with bud and concentrates. The concentrates are costing me the up to 60$/g for the very potent and tasty ones, and that&#039;s where most my money goes, but I&#039;m still trying to log on and order more :)

				If you have a coke/meth/heroin/rx habit and you&#039;re supplying it through SR, you are automatically in the 500+ a month category, and almost automatically if you get it off the streets.
