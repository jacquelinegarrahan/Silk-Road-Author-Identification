				I see the offerings posted on &quot;the lost city of A*******&quot; marketplace (not gonna plug their name here) are increasing day by day but I have checked about 100 or so listings and I have not found a single listing with a single feedback posted yet, and I have been looking through listing after listing to see if I can find any with no luck whatsoever.<br />&nbsp;Anyone even bought anything there yet? nobody seems to show any evidence of sales to me.

				I never heard of atlantix until it kept coming up on SR. So I signed up. I see one listing that I really wish I had in the mail right now while my 5 SR orders are &#039;processing&#039;, where vendors cannot shipped orders.. But I dont picture myself putting a single btc in that account anytime soon.&nbsp; If this is indeed what speculation says it is, it looks I, along with many others I&#039;d guess, am in for a world of trouble, SR being down for a whole month with dozens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in escrow and all.&nbsp; I probablly would test out a vendor there,since i found one who&#039;s the same [or using the MO of a] vendor I use on SR, except ALL my money is in escrow on SR orders that cant be filled.
