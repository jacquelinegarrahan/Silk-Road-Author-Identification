				I have 37-49 confirmations on two transactions that should&#039;ve showed in my account by now and I&#039;m worried that somewhere I&#039;ve been ripped off, thanks in advance for any insight offered and a Karma + 1 or your help. Please respond with reassuring news! :(<br /><br />P.S they were sent to my correct wallet ID i triple checked and thats the wallet ID I used to obtain this info form blockchain.<br /><br />yeah its only .8BTC total but still sucks

				I&#039;m waiting for double those bitcoins for several hours now, many confirmations as well. Reassurance necessary. <br /><br />edit: Or at least some closure, the ambiguity is killing me.

				This happens often when SR has been down for maintenance. All those transactions start backing up, and exchanges close on weekends, or scale down to just a handful of people minding the store. It will all catch up, don&#039;t fret. It always does. <br /><br />It&#039;s just the timing couldn&#039;t have been worse. Friday night. <br /><br />Places like BitInstant have only 1 or 2 people on for weekends. Hopefully it gets rectified sooner than later, but it will get rectified. If not by tomorrow.<br /><br />Monday morning, things will all be back to normal. Tough to hear that in an age of instant everything, but it&#039;s something that is unavoidable. <br /><br />Things just all have to &quot;catch-up&quot; with each other. Be patient is all I can advise.&nbsp; :-\

				Yes I sent some bitcoin about 6 hours and it still has yet to show up, I did the same thing to the same wallet yesterday and it only took about two hours. <br /><br />
