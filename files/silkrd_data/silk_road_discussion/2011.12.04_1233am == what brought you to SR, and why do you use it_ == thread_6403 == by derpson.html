				i&#039;m just wondering everyone&#039;s reasons for coming to this site and buying/selling product. especially the vendors (without giving away too many specifics, of course!)<br /><br />myself, my drug of choice is opiates. the kind you can IV. since about a year ago, vicodin and even marijuana has made me too anxious to enjoy the high. i stopped enjoying the way those drugs felt long ago, and i never enjoyed alcohol/xanax. nowadays the only kind of high i enjoy is the rush from roxis/heroin.<br /><br />unfortunately, the problem with these drugs is that a) if you have a solid local connect, you end up doing it every night and b) once you start doing it every night you don&#039;t stop because of withdrawal. even though i recently graduated from college and now am working a salaried IT job with plenty of room for career advancement, i saw my life slipping slowly out of my grasp and into my syringes.<br /><br />and i am covetous of what i have now.<br /><br />problem is, i&#039;m young and i can&#039;t imagine life without a way to kick back and get high. every once in a while. that&#039;s when SR kicked in. this site is perfect for me. getting bitcoin takes forever sometimes. at least 3 days. then it&#039;s another 3 days, minimum, to order and receive the product. it is so much easier to control my habit when there are restrictions on when and how you receive product. i&#039;m too poor of a planner and too much of a scrooge to drop more than enough bitcoin for a weekend&#039;s worth of highs at any given time, and over the last month since i joined, i&#039;m averaging 4 packages a month. in fact when i receive my next order, it will have been 2 weeks since i got high.<br /><br />that ain&#039;t bad.<br /><br />thanks to all the sellers who&#039;ve made my time here enjoyable!!<br /><br />howabout you, why are you here?

				i&#039;m also in the market for opiates.&nbsp; i&#039;m on here because it&#039;s difficult finding connects, especially in a small town.&nbsp; seems like it&#039;s all weed and meth.&nbsp; everyone says you need an old grandma for the pills.. well, that&#039;s not exactly easy to line up.

				I saw a vague post about it on 420chan, and when I google&#039;d it, it brought me to the cracked article. From there, I got TOR and did the necessary stuff to get BTC and make my first purchase. I think it was from slotmachine, which ended up being a scam. But I&#039;ve had good luck since then.<br /><br />I use SR because it&#039;s easier and cheaper than driving all the way up to the nearest city and trying to find someone trying to sell. Some drugs I use (MDMA, shrooms, etc.) are almost non-existant where I live. The main products in my area are weed and percs, though I have a friend who has heroin contacts that we call on occasionally.<br /><br />And because the above listed items are so hard to come by here, whenever they do show up they&#039;re incredibly expensive. If I buy 3 grams of MDMA on here for 180 dollars, I can resell it to several friends for 300 dollars and they&#039;d still be getting it for relatively cheap. I make a bit of money, we all get to roll when normally there&#039;d be no source... why wouldn&#039;t I use this site?<br /><br />I also hope to experiment in the next several months. I&#039;ve never tried Acid or a couple other substances I really want to use.

				This is the future. Im here because I feel it is much safer both ways for the buyer and the seller. Much better to buy your products here then on the street somewhere where you can jacked. The most important is the quality of the items&nbsp; on SR is top notch I say its better than a coffee house in Holland. The varieties of products available on SR is just amazing .

				i was introduced to molly about a year and a half ago... and well i love it. however the real stuff (by that i mean anything that within a reasonable dose that makes you roll) is all gone. its a very racially diverse college town and well someone seems to have told all the black guys here that molly is either heroin or lsd mixed with cut coke... :(&nbsp; and nothing against black people as the guy that the real stuff was coming from was black and/but from new york. then half the time there isnt even lsd or anything worth while in those caps. i wanna bring it back. for me and anyone else that misses our dear ol molly.

				I really can&#039;t focus on anything unless there&#039;s meth in my brain.&nbsp; Meth makes me actually feel like going to work.&nbsp; I&#039;m here primarily for prescription amphetamines (although those white ice speed pills from Mr. Ouid look tempting) because I have no health insurance and it&#039;s actually cheaper to get the pills on SR, even if I COULD afford $600-$1000 for a psychiatrist to screen me for ADHD and maybe give me a legit prescription.

				I came here trough the article on wired.<br /><br />Pff.. I made a small jump out ouf my chair when I logged in on SR the first time!&nbsp; ;D 8)<br /><br />I&#039;m here for occasional coke. First buy from Sesampino, haven&#039;t had such good coke in years! Bit more expensive, but as someone above in this topic already said, it&#039;s delivered at the door, it&#039;s on weight and awesome quality. The mobile number dealers that I know all sell crap and never can admit it.. Fuckin 6th time middleman schoolboys.. <br /><br />Also found MDA, opium, ketamine, meth (I just had to try it once.. hehe), DMT, dexedrine... All authentic/good quality! My girl rather wished I collected stamps since I found SR... hehe<br /><br />

				Im here for a combo of all i have seen.&nbsp; I love coke (all ive gotten so far)&nbsp; But don&#039;t want it to accessible.&nbsp; Its also nice to get quality and not worry as much about the stomped shit.&nbsp; I also do love the conversation with like minded (for the most part :) ) folk.&nbsp; It is also nice that when i want something, although i have to wait a few days, i can find what i want instead of hearing the same old re-up story about the mythical &quot;getting hooked up tonight&quot; story.<br /><br />One last thing i just though about but i haven t had to deal with, is a return type policy.&nbsp; It does seam that if you get some bunk shit you actually have an option to recupe some of your money back. Plus vendors need to stay on the up and up to stay on top!!<br /><br />

				Mostly just came to avoid having to deal with f2f and it&#039;s inherent risks.<br /><br />Around here the weed thats available sucks donkeys balls, your talking $200USD an ounce and it&#039;s full of seeds and tastes like shit, basically mexican brickweed and I hate it. That was my first purchase<br /><br />Then I realized I could get my hands on literally anything my heart desired so I started researching more about psychedelics (I tried a few when I was a kid but didn&#039;t really &#039;get it&#039; since I was doing it for &#039;fun&#039; or to be &#039;cool&#039;) and some of the RC&#039;s as well as dissociatives and others that have properties to help with depression and/or adhd or other various mental ailments commonly treated through years of psychological therapy.<br /><br />As a result I have a few personal likes/favorites, that list is expanding but I&#039;m also very disciplined about what I will venture into, I have a good professional job and all that typical stuff so the discreetness of it is what keeps me coming back I can literally order anything I want, have it here in a matter of days and I&#039;m the only one that needs to know about it other than perhaps a small group of friends.<br /><br />Now that I&#039;ve come to like it here (lots of good people, esp in SILC) I&#039;m offering up what i can in terms of my skillset to give a little something back and maybe make a little cash on the side with it, the longer SR lives the longer I get to have access to anything I want without having to know some local hookup.

				f2f does sometimes but usually the quality isn&#039;t always consistent where I am and the availability isn&#039;t there as much either so I know that as long as I determine which are the better vendors here I am able to ensure consistent quality and not usually a shortage of availability unless it&#039;s a shortage of cash on my behalf.

				I&#039;m brand new today, but I was told about this sight after getting ripped off on drugbuyersforum. I have been looking for something like this for a long time and I can&#039;t wait to find a vendor for Opana er. I am using this sight due to 6the herniated discs, bone spurs through my spine with bad arthritis in my back and neck. I have chronic pain through my legs back neck and shoulders. There have been many drs in my area arrested for abusing their prescription writing so now most other drs will not give pain killers of any sort. So I hope to find a trusted vendor to help me with my pain and also meet and talk to a lot of other people with similar interests.

				I happened on SR while doing some research on bitcoin, after I heard a story on NPR.&nbsp; I have been lurking on SR now for a couple of months and finally made a couple of purchases.&nbsp; The last 10 or years or so I have been taking my hydrocodone (have a great doc) and indulging when I get the chance either at a party or when I go home to visit my folks or go to Jamaica, Amsterdam or BC for vacation. I do not have any local contacts as I am a workaholic and have no social life. I did go to a festival last summer and had a couple of great trips. First time since Jerry died!! Also got a chance to try some Molly which was OK as well.<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s a mid-life crisis or I just got bored since my daughter went to college, but SR and the forum seems to be taking a bit more of my time of each day than than the day before. <br /><br />Since I work from home and make my living online it only makes sense to use SR...I do most of my shopping online, even get most of food delivered by a CSA program which has an online order form.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I stumbled across SR one day whilst reading a thread on the /psy/chedelics imageboard on 420chan. Googled it, and the rest is history. <br /><br />The reason that I continue to visit and use SR is because I was sick and tired of having to buy shit-quality drugs from shit-quality people. Seriously, there are no good dealers around here; everyone&#039;s a dick and is out to scam every sucker that walks through their door. In SR I&#039;ve found the opposite: Professionalism, customer service, anonymity, safety, etc.

				I live in suburbia, and people here are generally ignorant toward drugs - thus things like LSD and Molly are hard to come by.<br /><br />We get plenty of E pills, but they&#039;ve been slowly degrading in quality. Plus you have to run with a rough crowd, something I was willing to do in my younger years, but now that I&#039;m older I&#039;m more cautious about who I keep company with :)<br /><br />A neighbor of mine from k-12 was my contact for about 6 months, hooking me up fat with Oxy, constant supply etc.<br /><br />Well slowly but surely he started juking me on deals, a pill short here and there etc. Then he started calling me frantically, offering me unreal deals and straight ripping me.<br /><br />So I decided I was fed up with it, and decided to join the Road. Sure, its much more expensive... but the peace of mind of dealing with a good vendor in bulk is worth it for the small amounts that I use. Plus the prices keep it JUST prohibitive enough that I don&#039;t go off the deep end like before... I pick up a fat order of percs or what have you once in a while when I&#039;ve done something that I feel deserves a reward :)<br /><br />So basically - white suburbanite who likes drugs but doesn&#039;t like dealing with druggies when a white-glove transaction is just around the corner if you&#039;re willing to pay a little more.<br /><br />I&#039;ll take it.

				I can&#039;t remember exactly what I was searching in Google but I first read about the silk road on a blog about six months ago. I never bothered downloading Tor and checking it out until recently though.<br /><br />Pills are making a come back. You know the ones I&#039;m talking about, £10 street value super pills that send you wild. I really like them and I&#039;d choose them any day over powdered MDMA, especially when the MDMA in my area is touch and go in regards to quality. These pills aren&#039;t common in my area yet either, and I know people love them, so I want to stock up and sell them to friends and friends of friends.<br /><br />Moreover, I&#039;m very liberal. I&#039;m anti state, anti government, anti tax, anti central planning; pro freedom. No victim no crime. So this is the perfect place for me.<br /><br />I should be making my first purchase next week ready for some of the club nights that are lined up in January. Looking forward to it!

				I am new here.&nbsp; Heard about it a few weeks ago when I was trying to get some more diazepam and didn&#039;t want to pay the online pharma prices.&nbsp; Searched for online drugs and found TOPIX, where I got some diaz and here (didn&#039;t come here to start as it seemed a chore and I thought I would come here later).<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t do anything like the drugs I used to in the UK Acid House through to E scene.&nbsp; But I am curious about the place and will probably get some coke at some point.&nbsp; I know the quality is meant to be good here, but I need to study the bitcoin rate some more as it does seem pricey here too.<br /><br />However, there seem to be too many positives to outweigh paying a premium.

				I came here because I&#039;m fascinated by the technology field. To have a website like this is why I became interested in computers in the first place. You can do absolutely anything with an internet connection. This website being an example of just that. <br /><br />Also, I live in a very small countryside town where these items aren&#039;t available. Plus, the purity of some of these items is just remarkable. Everyone on here is veryy nice and helpful. It&#039;s a great commuity. Not just some savage drug dealers who shoot you for saying something about their mother.<br /><br />-Jimbob-

				SR and others I&#039;ve frequented in the past have been too long in coming. If SR had been around 20 years ago when I was in business, I&#039;d be a freakin zillionair by now.<br />Now that I&#039;m just a recreational stimulist and had the great fortune to not end up with a 32 cent piece of lead in my head back then, I commend the creators of SR<br />for their great endeavor and wish them and all of us a great run with this fine experiment. What a freakin world this has become when you can order your goods<br />from the comfort of your tor connection and with a little luck enjoy your favorite passtime. Thanks to all and a...... oh yeah..........Happy NEW YEAR.<br /><br />Bikerbum

				I was always somebody who could find ANYTHING, however over the years certain things are becoming more and more difficult to find (except weed which has become MUCh easier to find - in my state anyhow&nbsp; ;) ). LSD in particular has become extremely difficult to find, unless there&#039;s a music festival in town.<br /><br />So, I eventually gave up and searched on the web looking for this exact thing, basically. After a week or so I found the gawker article and that was that for me. Also, I used to be a &#039;vendor&#039; in the real world and back in those days we conducted A LOT of business through the mail, so I had no fear with regard to the shipping/recieving aspects.<br /><br />I have, and will, continue to use SR for those specialty items which are bit harder for me to find, like lsd. I also like that I get to compare different prices and vendors. It&#039;s unreal!

				I was at a big party once, trying to get some contacts for local pushers of MDMA. Too bad there&#039;s basically no legitimate ones in my area. But someone there asked me if I&#039;d heard of the Silk Road. I shook my head, and he smiled and told me to look into it. Fast forward a month and I take his advice seriously, start acquainting myself with Tor and all that, start exploring the network a bit from tor.dir. I basically spent a month researching SR to make sure it was safe and reliable, and that I wouldn&#039;t accidentally go to a scam website. Fast forward another couple months and here I am. Just made my first purchase today from someone I know to be reliable due to my research. It kind of blows my mind that I&#039;m just some college student with basically access to the Black Market. That&#039;s what technology has done for us. That&#039;s what the future will be.

				I saw &#039;SR&#039; mentioned on Topix (nasty place), and did some looking about till I found it.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t used it yet, but I intend to use it to supply myself with a few choice quality drugs that I can no longer source. I&#039;m a little too old looking for people to take me seriously now when I ask them for illicit substances etc. Nobody seems to bother here :)<br /><br />A big tip &#039;o the hat to all here though, and a reminder to anyone who wants to close it; It&#039;s either buy with calculated risks here, or buy fuck knows what on the street and risk life and limb in the process. SR is HR in practice. I thank you. <br /><br />And besides, in the grand drug world scheme of things, SR is but a scratch.
