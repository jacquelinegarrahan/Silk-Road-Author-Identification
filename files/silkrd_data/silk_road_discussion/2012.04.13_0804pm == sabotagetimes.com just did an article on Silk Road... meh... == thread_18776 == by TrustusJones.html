				I&#039;m not sure why but people seem to forget that SR is not even .01% of the DarkWeb.<br /><br />The DarkWeb has pretty much everything, and SR happens to be part of the DarkWeb.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been to .onion sites on the DarkWeb where you can get anything, I&#039;ll name some of the few:<br /><br />Hired Kidnappers<br />Hired Assasins<br />&#039;Swatters&#039;-They can have someones house raided if you pay them<br />Drugs(of course)<br />Child Porn<br />SLAVES<br />Children Slaves<br />Child Trafficking<br />Prostitute Trafficking<br />Humans Kidnapped and Experimented on. <br />Bombs<br />Terrorism<br />Terrorism Plots<br />Bio Weapons<br />Anthrax<br /><br /><br /><br />The list goes on. You can literally find anything on the DarkWeb... but all the legal stuff is on the normal internet... so the DarkWeb concentrates the bad of the bad. Do not be fooled. <br /><br />SR may be a friendly community but even in the eyes of some criminals the DarkWeb is filled with some of the worst of the worst.<br /><br />

				We were in the sun and the daily mail, and US senators already came out against us, and the site is still going strong. I seriously doubt &quot;sabotage times&quot; is anything to worry about.

				To be fair on the reporters TJ we do have C4 over at the Armory. I was considering buying it and doing a fake terrorist attack...nothing ever happens where I live....<br /><br />To be fair that was one of the more balanced articles about The Road. At least he wasn&#039;t doing a Rupert Murdoch. The Zombie attack thing was pretty funny too.

				Oh no, they picked a weird guy to talk to. That guy from NZ has been hanging out with his sheep for too long, I keep seeing the plastic knife he has for sale on the front page, no reporting on that, just the C4. And the reporter didn&#039;t mention any of my non-lethal Mace products or my ultra-cool law enforcement caps. No free advertising for me.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Here is a link to the plastic knife:<br /><br />http://ayjkg6ombrsahbx2.onion/silkroad/category/215<br /><br /><br />Feb<br />

				I know it&#039;s shit when you don&#039;t get your stuff up in the articles. I really hope my Full-Tactical Ballistic Armor or my ex MOD Land Rover Defender gets up in the pages one day!
