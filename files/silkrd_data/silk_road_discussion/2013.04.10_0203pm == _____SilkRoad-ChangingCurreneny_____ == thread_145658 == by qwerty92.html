				OK first of all i understand this should be in Rumour mill but with all the spam i feel it wont get addressed.<br /><br />Heard that SR may change its currency from BTC to LTC<br /><br />is there any truth in this Modz????<br /><br />I have my own predictions to what this may cause if this is the case

				I was going to ask this question this week.<br /><br />I have found alternative sites to Silk Road...that only take LTC.<br /><br />I guess I never thought about it, but the same way that you have different country currencies, will we now see a trend of alternative digital currencies not tied to any country or government?<br /><br />Will we begin to see exchanges flooding the clearnet and deepweb just like one is trading the yen or the Deutschmark or the ruble or the baht or the British Sterling or the dollar?<br /><br />This is going to get very, very, very interesting in 2013.

				Well, I&#039;d be in favor of using a currency that&#039;s not quite so bonkers as BTC is right now, but a transition to LTC would be majorly disruptive and I&#039;d worry that once that happened, LTC would start acting just like BTC.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think that if BTC can calm down from the current frenzy, we have a chance to perfect the acquisition and distribution channels for it, and it will be what it promises to be.

				I think it&#039;s crazy how much of a role that SR has in the Bitcoin economy. I bet if DPR shut the site down for good, Bitcoin prices would drop down to less than 120.00. I could just be talking out of my ass, but that&#039;s just my hypothesis about it.

				If SR kills off bitcoin, bitcoin price will drop a fair bit and LTC price would increase a lot.<br />I&#039;m not sure how LTC is managed though, so I can&#039;t be sure, but that&#039;s the most likely outcome.
