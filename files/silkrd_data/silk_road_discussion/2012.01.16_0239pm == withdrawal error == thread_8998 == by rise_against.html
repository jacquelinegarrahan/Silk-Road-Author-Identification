				i tried to withdrawal BTC from my accout the other day, and it gave me an error message i&#039;ve never seen before. It said &quot;Error, Try again in a minute or two.&quot; but the thing is, the bitcoins i tried to withdrawal were subtracted from my account, but never arrived to my client&#039;s wallet.

				Hey this same exact thing has just happened to me yesterday and I have been messaging support but they are not being helpful at all. After my first large withdrawal I tried a second one with a small amount of bitcoins to see if it would happen again and it happened again. it gave me the same message &quot;error, try again in a minute or two&quot; but it still took the coins out of my account. Please, I am freaking out right now so anything you can tell me about what happened would be great. thanks <br /><br />U

				Thanks for the quick response. I am freaking out, but I can be a lot more patient now that I know you guys are on top of this. Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help solve this problem. If this is widespread I can see how a lot of vendors would be nervous right now. <br /><br />U

				I&#039;ve just had the same thing happen to me tonight. There are a lot of tech problems where a generic &quot;we&#039;re aware of the problem and eventually will get it fixed&quot; response is OK, but this is a core issue that really has to get solved ASAP.

				Hello ,<br />Of course its like the chicken and egg , we need each other and SR needs vendors and buyers . Just wish wothdrawal would just work like it used to , oh well what can we do ? nothing? Be patient is the only thing i can think of , i have submitted a report but they have yet to read it .
