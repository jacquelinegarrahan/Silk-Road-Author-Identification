				The same thing is happening again. People dont get they need to stop window shopping and jamming it up. Even when I was getting in last night, I could tell it was locking up again and being overwhelmed. Cant even get to the site this morning. This site isnt working well either. All my posts are not getting sent out.

				Spent a large amount of money placing an order last night, completely regret it now. I thought the issues had been fixed. I&#039;m not even trying to sue the site in prime time.<br /><br />Fuck this, we need something new, the incompetence of this staff is ridiculous. When will all of you kiss ass cock suckers say enough? When its down for 2 weeks, how about 3 weeks?
