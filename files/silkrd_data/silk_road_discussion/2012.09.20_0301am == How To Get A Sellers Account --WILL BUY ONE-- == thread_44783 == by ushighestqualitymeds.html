				Hello all,<br />I have access to unlimited amounts of these prescriptions: Roxicodone 30mg, Oxycontin 80mg OP, Vyvanse 60mg, Suboxone 8mg, Adderall 20mg IR, and Methadone 10mg pill and 100mg liquid. I also have access to cannabis: anywhere from quarter ounces to pounds of top shelf, indoor marijuana cheaper than anywhere on silk road...trust me, I&#039;ve checked. <br /><br />Well since I have all of this...why not get a sellers account? I&#039;m rather new to this and have been thoroughly trying to get a sellers account but have had no luck. Please let me know how to access a sellers account so I can you all these awesome products at phenomenal prices!<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />usHighestQualityMeds<br />(future vendor on Silk Road for highest quality prescription medications/cannabis at the best prices)

				I&#039;ve looked all over the page and can&#039;t find a link to that. My account is relatively new does it not appear if my account is too new?

				This bothers me a bit, the guy can not find a link to &quot;become a sell&quot;... Does he have pgp figured out? Encrypted drives? Shipping, DNC&#039;s, system security, customer security, etc,etc,etc.<br /><br />In the grand scheme of thing, locating the &quot;become a seller&quot; link is about the simplest thing in the list of becoming a seller.

The number of people looking to sell who can&#039;t find the &quot;Become a seller&quot; link is very worrying. I mean most people search through all the various parts of their account out of simple curiosity but these people don&#039;t even do that. Nor do they seem to know how to use the Search function.<br /><br />I keep an encrypted list of any potential vendor I see asking these kinds of questions and make sure never to buy from them in the future, assuming they use the same name both on the Forum and on SR itself. As a customer I&#039;d be very wary about the security of my personal details were I to make a transaction with any of these vendors.

				Go ahead and get someone to sell you there sellers name. Oliver did something very uncool so I outed him. Hell I even gave him my contacts name (which I gave the whole board, but they would rather pay 1/4 of what it costs to get a KG from China. Hell I did it with Oliver and when I gave Admin TONS OF Proof and they don&#039;t give a fuck. All they care about is money. As long as he keeps selling my product then they don&#039;t give a fuck cause that means a shit loads of money keep lining their pockets. This site isn&#039;t about fucking the man. It&#039;s about MONEY! I read all this bullshit about DPR telling us we are Hero&#039;s. Fuck that. All you&#039;re trying to do is make more sells. I&#039;ve said my piece and most likely will get deleted - perminently. Well fuck this place in a year it&#039;s before for fighting for a drug free world, to a cash making machine
