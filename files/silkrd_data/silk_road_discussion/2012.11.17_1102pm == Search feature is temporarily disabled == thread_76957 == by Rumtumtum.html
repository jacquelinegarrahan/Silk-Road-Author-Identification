				I&#039;ve been getting that message now for nearly 24 hours when I try using the search function. I dug up this old thread about it http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3471.0, but am posting on the main board in the hope of getting a speedy reply as I&#039;m a tad freaked that I seem to be the only person having this problem. Plus some of the what seemed at the time to be pretty paranoid posts I read during the downtime are coming back to haunt me.<br /><br />If anyone&#039;s had the same message at all I&#039;d appreciate it if you could post to help put my mind at ease. Thanks folks.

				Trust you, I have the same problem.<br />Though, vendors from which I bought now lost all their listings to me.<br />Or have gone to stealth mode without them knowing.<br /><br />Koelen3.

				Thanks for the reply koelen3. Oddly, my main vendor&#039;s disappeared too - though a couple that I&#039;ve ordered from in the past still have listings up. I think a few sellers may&#039;ve had their confidence in SR rattled a bit by the recent problems which might account for the vendors vanishing. It&#039;s a relief to know I&#039;m not the only one having the problem though. Hopefully just a blip.

				I&#039;m glad I could help you.<br />I found it weird too, but ah well...<br />At least DPR has given me my bitcoins which were lost.<br /><br />Koelen3.
