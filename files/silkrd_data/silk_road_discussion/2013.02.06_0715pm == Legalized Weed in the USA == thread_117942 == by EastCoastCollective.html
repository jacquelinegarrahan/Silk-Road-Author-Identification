				Will legal weed help or hurt your weed vending in the real world.&nbsp; Where Do you think will prices go?&nbsp; I think it will be bad for me.

				I don&#039;t see it effecting me unless a big company picks up some amazing growers/genetics and starts pumping out connoisseur greade cannabis products to the masses for cheap. I just don&#039;t see how they can do it any cheaper then what is currently being done and still get the same quality, time will tell though...<br /><br />For you east coast guys, though, I know weed is expensive there for quality and if &quot;big business&quot; starts pumping out quality product I don&#039;t see how you&#039;ll compete without a farm.

				I think by checking out the coffee shop scene in amsterdam, we can get a glimpse of how it would work.<br /><br />It would always be a boutique type of market, like wine.&nbsp; There will be growers with specific strains and methods that will appeal to each person.&nbsp; So, there will always be a market for quality and care.&nbsp; The bigger the grow op, the crappier the weed gets.&nbsp; It becomes generic and all about money.&nbsp; A small grow op on the other hand, spends more money on growing products and enhancements and take care of them like they were children.&nbsp; So you get a better weed that is organic and healthy.&nbsp; I guess just like chicken and eggs.&nbsp; The smaller the farm the beter the taste.&nbsp; Big factory operations are all about chemicals and as cheap as possible results.&nbsp; &nbsp;Budwiser is much cheaper to produce than small craft beers, but small craft beers taste better and worth the extra few bucks.<br /><br />I think prices will hold steady considering the formula for the cost of electricity and the cost of growing supplies.&nbsp; Those elements add to the value of the product big time.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, weed grown outdoors in the open field in nature will be much cheaper, but it will also be much crappier in the end.&nbsp; Outdoor weed is never as good.&nbsp; Its also leafier and crystals have problems forming with the outdoor weather conditions and insects, etc. . , so you can always tell cheap weed from good weed.&nbsp; The difference is what it was fed and the conditions its grown in-&nbsp; all of which cost more money.&nbsp; So, weed prices will reflect the cost of electricity and grow food supplies.<br /><br />You would become a boutique and offer a specific strain and method that people will gladly pay for.&nbsp; (Organic, small farm produced, etc. . ) So you can stand out from the pack easily.&nbsp; Your L.S.D. strain looks quite nice in those pictures you have listed and I&#039;m sure it compares to Kush if not better.&nbsp; Imagine if you were one of the only people in the US with that strain.&nbsp; I think you are the only SR vendor with it.<br /><br />Also, in amsterdam there is a huge amount of value-added products for sale such as soaps, weed cookies, baked goods, shampoo, oils, spreads, hashes and so much more.&nbsp; You can turn crappy weed into awesome hash and cookies!&nbsp; &nbsp;Add value to it and sell it for more.&nbsp; This is the farmers market type of products you would see everywhere.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br />

				yes your right. i am hoping to be &quot;the go to guy&quot; when you want barneys LSD. It is very compatable with the&nbsp; &nbsp;real og im talking about original gangster. the og is denser nuggs and has a nice smell&nbsp; BUT potency wise Barneys is stronger. I have Kosher Kush as well thats a great strain from Reserva Privada It won 2 HIGH TIMES&nbsp; Indica Cups&nbsp; But LSD is stronger<br />You made a good point about indoor growing. Commercial and Industrial power rates are very high. And I doubt advanced nutes give that much of a discount&nbsp; maybe their biggest client will get 40% discount? <br />Thoughts?

				My thoughts would be to trash them euro genetics and get some legit west coast genetics, that&#039;s what people want these days...Same with advanced nutes, they&#039;re overpriced and you can get better quality product from basically any other base and some good teas.

				I cant see much of an impact most country&#039;s its illegal period, And i doubt most would follow in the steps of the usa becoming weed legal, i think it would create more business here on sr as alot of vendors might sell to the rest of the world that just cant get any.<br /><br />

				I think we can learn something from the alcohol market. That is there are a lot of people who are perfectly willing to shell out good money for a terrible product that is made only with bottom line in mind. However like the alcohol market there are a lot of people (like you and I?) who have a discerning taste for cannabis. You probably don&#039;t want to just smoke any crappy old schwag but there&#039;s still a huge market for Steel Reserve and O.E. 800.<br />Basically I&#039;m saying commercial grade poo-poo weed will probably have a place in the legal market...as a lot of people are stupid.

From the fruity strains to the sours to the hazes, you get the idea. I&#039;d hate to see them go. I&#039;m just talking about today&#039;s market in the U.S. is mostly interested in the og&#039;s and it&#039;s hybrids, at least that&#039;s what is selling out for me with no problems, ever. But, yes I see what you&#039;re saying. Maybe, have one commercialized strain that is the standard for everyone to use that is beneficial in many different ways. Yeah, for me I like it all but not everyone is so passionate about cannabis.

				Well, it would likely hurt me a bit, being that it would be harder for me to sale half n smoke for free cause it would be much more available,&nbsp; but in the long run i would be much happier because i could likely smoke better.&nbsp; Most.. and i mean 99% of the weed on SR is not top notch, it&#039;s commercial indoor.. or even worst -commercial greenhouse.&nbsp; You got some top grade, let me know?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i want the strains pushing around 20%+ thc, and visually coated with crystals on top of crystal.<br /><br />i need a haze or strong trippy sativa, then a evening hybrid which will relax me at end of day.&nbsp; everybody trying to get the next best top notch strain, i wish for consistency even if it&#039;s the same strains forever. with that said, when i start my smaller grow i&#039; would love to do a good haze sativa and a good blueberry hybrid, but i&#039;ll likely settle for specializing in select sativa i plan to smoke always.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

That said, I think it would be very bad for vendors. Farmers of legal products almost always get low prices. Many vendors from &#039;less legally dangerous places to grow&quot; are here because so many people are getting in on it (in their local area) that there is much less demand and falling prices. <br />Don&#039;t fool yourself, If we get corporate farming, they will easily be able to grow the top end weed in large amounts. It will be more expensive to produce and priced higher than their lower quality products. The masses will likely buy more of the cheaper stuff like they do with beer (good quality beer has always been available).<br /><br />&nbsp;Corporate farming will have economies of scale that, I believe, will allow them to sell so cheap that small growers will be able to buy the dank cheaper than growing it themselves, unless they have free power or some other advantage.<br /><br />&nbsp;Small growers will still grow as it is an artform/addiction/love thing to grow the best buds.&nbsp; NWN

				It would indeed be bad for vendors and great for growers. That being said, if you research deeply into how the federal government is cracking down on LEGIT growers and dispensaries in Cali, even&nbsp; with it being legal, I would say it will be a longtime before weed is completely legal. Federal government has been performing raids on dispensaries and growers in Northern California as well as not protecting them from such raids even though California has legalized weed a longtime ago. It has become a battle between Federal and State government.

				They would probably still make growing it illegal unless u apply for permits etc, and only the rich could afford to grow.<br />We are not allowed to make or own medecin , alcohol or tobacco , what makes you think they would let you grow your own weed..<br />I read of stories in USA whe you can&#039;t grow vegetables in your own garden.<br />

				dont know what your looking for then. you say strong sativas (i.e. super lemon haze, madman OG) and 20+% and each strain i have gotten has to have breached that. maybe not the first wave of the GDP, the circular buds with orange hairs. He just put some berry royale up, you should check that out. that bud is to the point where you don&#039;t wanna sell it, only smoke it up.
