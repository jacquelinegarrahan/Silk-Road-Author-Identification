				Hello all, for what I&#039;ve read you must always use Escrow for this even to happen, but what is the actual resolution when you are sent lower quality that advertized with many reports of that in the forum? Would the resolution center be in the buyer side? What kind of refund should I expect? I see most cases just solve this with the Vendor, but I think this sucks because he will still be giving out low quality with good quality promise.<br /><br />Thanks

				If you have not finalized already, the resolution center might help you.&nbsp; Then again, ask yourself, is the quality of my received product so far below acceptable that I am going to trash this vendor&#039;s reputation over it?&nbsp; Is there a big enough disparity between what I expected and what I got?<br /><br />If it is, go for it.&nbsp; Vendors should be held to a high standard.&nbsp; HOWEVER, the best first step is to talk to the vendor.&nbsp; There have been cases where the vendor doesn&#039;t KNOW his product is inferior (bad batch or something like that), this has happened to me and some vendors are very nice about it and made it right.&nbsp; Though, some vendors are not as professional.&nbsp; Your only recourse then is the resolution center, bad rating and/or bad review on the forums.

				Well if you are concerned I am sure you have searched the forums to see if this is an isolated problem or others are saying the same. Resolution doesn&#039;t cover quality from what I have read. Type of product might help and if you are certain of quality concerns find the vendors review thread and voice your concerns in there. trashing a good vendor would end bad but if it is a bad vendor then making others aware helps us all.

				I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d call it scamming a vendor. The original poster has already said that the quality is low and the promise is of good quality. Why should a vendor make PROFIT out of something that is considerably lower quality than advertised? <br /><br />This is the first I&#039;ve heard of SR resolution centre not covering quality. People might as well all say it&#039;s amazing quality or nothing at all if that&#039;s really the case!

I am sure we have all bought low quality off the streets&nbsp; its hard to get a refund .&nbsp; I am not saying anything about the quality I have no clue to good or bad.&nbsp; but take a buyer and seller one has been on the road for a year the other a month with many transactions there has never has been a problem automatically people would be more likely to believe the person here for a year weather they are buyer or seller. until there were 2 complaints

				Hello!<br /><br />Always use escrow if its an option, its there to help you.<br /><br />The thing with quality is you need to do some research on the feedback forums. The Vendor may have a different idea of quality compared to others. The vendor will be favoured usualy, as he is just stating his opinion on quality, not amount, weight , appearence, e.t.c.<br />It doesnt mean hes trying to con you, everyone has a different opinion on quality.<br />General rule dont FE.<br />Vendors should try to keep a high standard of service, so always try and discus the matter with them before tarnishing their reputation if its quite a good one. <br />Sometimes they get a bad batch and they might not relise this.<br />It can be harsh on a new vendor aswel if they are trying to get a good rep early on.<br />A sign of a good vendor is if they try to resolve the problem.<br />Dont ever say you didnt recieve, if you dont like the quality, honesty goes a long way.<br />Remember quality will vary greatly between vendors, thats what the feedback is for.<br /><br />

				It depends on how the vendor advertises the product.<br /><br />If it&#039;s someone like MTL John who claims to have &#039;The best M39 in the world, no one can beat the quality of my M39 and it&#039;s top shelf medical weed (WHICH IT ISN&#039;T BY THE WAY MTL JOHN)&quot; then you have every right to call them on it and open up a resolution.&nbsp; If for nothing else, to get that vendor to stop claiming their product is something that it&#039;s not.<br /><br />If it&#039;s just not what you &#039;expected&#039; then no you should not open a resolution and should give the vendor a 5/5 for getting you active product safely.&nbsp; Then just don&#039;t use that vendor again if you want a higher standard of quality.

				In no other capacity of buying drugs if someone tells you &quot;this stuff is FIRE, really high quality I promise&quot; are you actually guaranteed for it to be great.&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve heard all kinds of hype about a boring, heavily overrated bag.<br /><br />But you still got the bag.&nbsp; You&#039;ll know not to do business with that vendor next time if you&#039;re really unhappy about it.&nbsp; There are a couple vendors I will not use because their trim jobs are terrible and I end up paying for a huge amount of waste (that&#039;s also technically false advertisement to a point, but not so much you can do anything about it).<br /><br />If McDonlad&#039;s advertises &quot;the best, most mouth watering burger&quot; and you buy it, and it tastes like shit to you, don&#039;t expect them to care.&nbsp; You just don&#039;t buy another one.&nbsp; This business is way to gray to be demanding some kind of repercussion =/

				Hello, thanks fort he replies. This hasn&#039;t happened to me yet, I&#039;m just doing my homework. I could not find useful info about this matter. <br /><br />I see many say the quality depends on me, that is not the case of many drugs. For example LSD, vendor may claim its 150 but is actually 50. <br /><br />Frankly if you don&#039;t know your product that equals bad vendor to me. A vendor that knows his stuff, knows anybody that tries to scam about low quality, that&#039;s just common sense, you must know this if you are a vendor, selling what you promise will give you great feedback and reports that will make you trusted in the community in very little time, lots of transactions. Background resolution may be fine in some cases, but the fact that he is gonna still be selling with bad advertizing is the part that bothers me.<br /><br />Also I guess this goes to new vendors, old pro that do it right will have his reports and feedback. And why are you comparing SR with street drugs? In the streets you can&#039;t do nothing about it, here you can and you must. The less scams the better no? Better SR to everyone.

If the order does not arrive the vendor has no influence on that.&nbsp; He is not the mailman.<br />The risk is stated in the profile (in general) and is mutual agreed upon when ordering. <br />Some countries are a higher risk so the buyer from that country will get less because he want to order knowing !!! the risk.<br />He can also order locally/domestic....<br />So if all this is clear there cannot be another outcome then to give a 5/5/ because the vendor did ALL he could. That is why there is the feedback.<br />Specially looking at his feedback....(5/5 for 9 months!) yeah right....bought feedback. You also have the feedback they write.<br />You are not stupid I think....if you can read you will see how the vendor is judged beside the /5<br />Anyway, lucky learned a lot the last months, take the fuckers right out...(in most cases :-))<br />First order very small and slowly build up, I&#039;m in control. I am not greedy, small orders are safer to start with.<br />Don&#039;t like it....don&#039;t buy....(ever again LOL)<br />So, if you have more excuses to give buyers your advice than you are more corrupted than I thought.

				OK we&#039;re talking about different things. I&#039;m not a snob and I wouldn&#039;t leave bad feedback if the coke/weed (for example) didn&#039;t look nice. I wouldn&#039;t leave bad feedback for non-delivery (unless I suspected the seller of not sending it). I&#039;m only talking about product quality (the original subject of this thread) when smoked/ingested etc. From my experience, it doesn&#039;t help very much if you start with a small order and then work upwards because it depends on the reliability of the seller. I think Silk Road should make it clear in their terms whether or not the resolution center covers quality because I definitely think it should.

				yes you are right...different things. The thread was quality and.... you gave the advice to tell the vendor it did not arrived when you don&#039;t like the quality.<br />The reason you give is that it would not be settled in the resolution center.<br />So, again, you give advice to scam the vendor because the reason is obviously to get a refund/resend whatever. <br />That is SCAMMING...sorry cannot call it anything else. Scam is lying about the delivery to get a profit, that was the advice you gave.<br />I am not a US citizen so maybe my English is not that good but that I know.<br />&nbsp;

				and....quality is subjective. How can you think a mod/admin in the resolution center can judge that?

				OK I agree it&#039;s a bit dishonest, but I blame it on Silk Road for not making it clear what the resolution centre considers when making it&#039;s decisions. As for your last point, I agree that there&#039;s a bit of subjectivity but I also believe that there is a bit of objectivity too, otherwise opinions (especially the feedback system which you so often talk about) wouldn&#039;t count for anything. Lastly, I&#039;ve never &#039;profited&#039; from doing this (unless you talking in a very strict sense), I&#039;ve only claimed a refund for something that I&#039;ve binned because it was so poor. I would rather &#039;profit&#039; by them than they &#039;profit&#039; by me for selling a bad product. If you genuinely stand by the quality of your products, stop blackmailing people to leave 5 stars because I think it&#039;s plain selfish and greedy of you.

				but it is so simple....quality is mentioned in the feedback comments. So if you want you can find if people are happy with that product. That is why there is no SR resolution for quality , you can see for yourself and read what the 300+ customers had to say about it..<br />There is however a resolution for missing, not delivered orders.<br />That is why there is a refund policy, to share the risk.<br />When you order you agree on the policy...right? Or else you would not order from this vendor.<br />You read the statement about refund so you know if it does not make it you get ...%<br />From all the info you have now it is clear that your vendor of choice is honest, has good stuff and you agree to the policy.<br />So you order and in the mysterious world of USPS it goes missing. That&#039;s the risk you take. <br />Not the vendors fault because he sent it, nice stealthy package (again feedback for info about that).<br />So what is the reason the VENDOR ?? get a bad rating for the USPS loosing YOUR package for what you get the promised refund.<br />The vendor did his utmost best like always, if USPS had not lost the package you would give 5, USPS lost it and you give 3/5 or worse 1/5.....that is strange to me but hey....I am just an honest vendor :-)<br />And yes, I guarantee&nbsp; the quality, straight from the pharmacy. Cannot be tempered with. <br />You say being dishonest is okay when you profit from it....a weird way of thinking.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

A vendor that knows his stuff, knows anybody that tries to scam about low quality, that&#039;s just common sense, you must know this if you are a vendor, selling what you promise will give you great feedback and reports that will make you trusted in the community in very little time, lots of transactions. Background resolution may be fine in some cases, but the fact that he is gonna still be selling with bad advertizing is the part that bothers me.<br /><br />Also I guess this goes to new vendors, old pro that do it right will have his reports and feedback.

Maybe I&#039;m stupid ......but if I want something I look at different vendors and see what they (customers) have to say about them.<br />The customer has the best know-how.<br />No admin can determent the quality (cool, shitloads of samples they have to check)....no matter how hard you try to make it somebody else&#039;s responsibility.<br />But again, my biggest worry was the &#039;&#039;scam the vendor statement&#039;&#039;...that blew my mind.<br />You are just clueless, no problem but that statement is just plain wrong and&nbsp; (sound a little childish) dishonest.<br />That is what is a great good here...honesty. That is why people keep buying from that one trusted vendor and would never go anywhere else if they can help it.<br />I really hope that the advice will help you to find your way here and that you will have many happy pursuits <br />

				Please check back and see I did not said that statement that got to your nerves. It seems you think it was me?<br /><br />This problem hasn&#039;t happened to me because I have just ordered from top Vendors with feedback, but what happens to New Vendors and the people who get scammed by them. You see, is a matter that need to be addressed, the more amount of vendors offering the same, equals to lower prices for costumers, but most don&#039;t even want to risk someone without feedback hence few become trusted, so established trusted can charge high no problem.

				I did not say it was you, I know it was an other guy....never the less a shocking statement.<br />Its kinda strange that you worry about new vendors and that they have maybe low quality???&nbsp; but not to someone who say you need to scam the vendor.etc etc.<br />quote but what happens to New Vendors and the people who get scammed by them. end<br />okay, now I understand, you are worried about all those people who got scammed by new vendors.<br />I really doubt that that is the case anyway.<br />A vendor is only as good as his reputation. <br />Say 10 orders and 8 feedback of scamming put him out of business. He did not even get the chance to earn the money back that he payed to be a vendor anyway. <br />That is what I don&#039;t like about your statement the &#039;&#039;scamming new vendors&#039;&#039;. You did not even had a experience with that as you said yourself.<br />Again you want to put the judgement for the quality by the admins in resolution and I tell you they cannot judge that and....more important....the customers will deal with him and he soon is out of business.<br />The idea that the trusted vendors will ask high prices. ...of course there will be some difference but everybody is free to do as he please<br />In general the prices are sort of the same and if not....just look for the cheapest one :-)<br /><br />
