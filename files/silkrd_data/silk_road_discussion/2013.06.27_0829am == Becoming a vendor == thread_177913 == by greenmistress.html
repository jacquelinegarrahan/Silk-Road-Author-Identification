				Hey everyone. I&#039;m new to the forums. I would like to become a vendor as I&#039;m sure many people do. I&#039;m very patient and in no rush but I would like to begin the process. Could somebody point me in the right direction? I found this thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=360.0 but it&#039;s fairly old. If it&#039;s as simple as upgrading an SR account then I probably look foolish, it&#039;s just that SR is down, or I have an old address, and I&#039;m not a member there (I don&#039;t personally use anything). Thank you.

				Go to SR, click your account / at the bottom (or on the right) is a button to become a vendor.<br /><br />It costs a couple of bitcoins to become one, but after 35 good sales and $1,500 worth of sales you get that back.

				Ah so it is that simple, thanks. Is silkroadv5p5cbl6.onion still the correct address? Edit: Nevermind, I see it in your signature. I appreciate the reply.

				With your current account, if you have purchased anything with it then you should create a new, clean account to use as your sellers account.<br /><br />Keep one account for buying and one for selling.

				Since posting this I have read quite a bit including the seller&#039;s guide. I appreciate all the replies though truly. <br /><br />I installed Tor for the first time today and I found that link on a wordpress website through startpage. Luckily there was a link to this forum from reddit&#039;s /r/silkroad and sk0rt had his vendor address with the real silk road!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Here is my understanding of the different aspects of being a vendor. If anyone is willing to read them and make any corrections it would mean a great deal to me.<br /><br />Packing/Shipping:<br /><br />- Send USPS Priority with DCN<br />- Use mylar/MBB<br />- Place in something for stealth<br />- Use nitrile gloves<br />- Print your labels with correct spelling<br />- Use minimal tape<br />- Don&#039;t send from my residence (duh)<br /><br />Security:<br /><br />- Use Tails OS<br />- Use PGP<br />- Use auto withdrawal to 3 bitcoin addresses<br />- Cash out with moneypaks, not MtGox.<br />- Don&#039;t save any customer info. (again, duh :P)<br /><br />Sales:<br /><br />- Peg price to dollar<br />- No FE at first<br />- Price low at first but don&#039;t do freebies<br />- Use escrow<br />- Match your SRF and SR usernames so you can access the vendor board eventually<br />- Have lots o&#039; product<br />- Communicate<br /><br />The only question I have that&#039;s unanswered is how to make my return address legitimate but anonymous. I have a company name and PO box I can use to hide my identity and address from customers. Problems would arise if law enforcement were involved though because the company and PO box are in my name. I was thinking of doing general delivery as my return address but that&#039;s probably suspicious.

				Oh and my own personal touch: hairnets! Come on people.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Regarding my wariness with my address and law enforcement I&#039;m imagining a scenario where the customer gets a controlled delivery, is arrested and then is asked to bait me. They&#039;re told to tell me they don&#039;t like the quality (red flag! my shit is chron) and want a refund. They send it back, I go to pick it up and my ass is fucked. I could just leave it there forever but who&#039;s to say that isn&#039;t suspicion enough for them to get a search warrant for my residence. <br /><br />I&#039;m just not sure about this return address thing. In one of the stickies a postal worker says not to use a fake address because it raises suspicion, not to mention you can&#039;t ever get your stuff back. Hmm.

				if you&#039;ve been logging in and posting here without tor you should probably start a new forum account.<br />don&#039;t use your address or any connected to you as a return, use local businesses, mix it up. taking the loss on some product here and there is a risk you have to factor in to being a vendor.

				I&#039;ve only accessed this forum and any clearnet site talking about the silk road with Tor. I&#039;ll abandon this account and make another when I eventually invest in everything and pay the vendor fee.<br /><br />Anyway with using local businesses is it possible to also use a DCN? If it is, is it a guarantee that a scammer won&#039;t be able to negatively affect my rating if I provide the DCN?

				i don&#039;t know your postal system, i&#039;m on the wrong side of the pond. tracking just proves the package was delivered so you get paid if they claim no delivery in resolution. if they then want to give you 1/5 and call you a scammer they will.

Disputes can be resolved by reships or refunds but you will not be asking customers to return goods to you.&nbsp;
