				Hello all,<br /><br />You are probably familiar with me. I am a reputable pot vendor Ranked in the top 3% with 97% feedback. I have moved a great deal of herb through this site and share all of your disappointment with the ongoing outage. I was honestly hoping that the pirate&nbsp; would have things sorted out by now but at this point I think I must make an effort to help &quot;man the helm&quot; so to speak, LOL.<br /><br />As usual I am still here with a ton of weed and I still like&nbsp; earning a living, so anyone who would like to purchase from me may contact me here via PM or via Tor Chat (&nbsp; ud6nfhhuazae7jbb&nbsp; ).&nbsp; As things develop I will possibly add other communications contacts as well, which I will append to the bottom of this original post.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />As per usual I have the following strains up for sale:<br /><br />Alaskan Thunkderfuck <br />Sour Diesel<br />NYC Sour Diesel<br />Strawberry Kush<br />Bubba Kush<br />Acid<br />Lavender Kush<br />Purple Diesel<br />Early Girl<br /><br />I also have some new strains available for now:<br />Jah<br />Chem4<br />Alaskan Ice<br />Boulder Kush<br /><br /><br />Prices:<br />1 gram $21<br />3.5 grams $42<br />7 grams $82<br />14 grams $160<br />1 ounce $275<br /><br />Shipping $6<br /><br />Packaging is very stealth, all items are handled with great attention to detail, are packed inconspicuously, are multi layered and materials are chosen for their high permeability standards (wont leak smell). <br /><br />Looking forward to doing business,<br /><br /><br />Anonymart <br /><br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />mQENBFA4VXEBCAChrYeW1hcX/1RiO5KXbIO9P2mJjmIYq8xD218gV0yoYMSiEfZd<br />fES95dCOK/4QUVJxjISMp60sVhZ3FuMK1MZGDkGwPZEEg9FGpqVNw8KTXxXsry5t<br />7ajTsSMfevKOXauUQu4luSaTHuJo2E/ntOy0JyogJMKiSLxRIfrpFmQmJWZSw2Aj<br />oRCRaS6rPSzF3YjESH4AjpYpnz5BRNM8yXOUNNCujgEIIUGo80h4RokTywL5v2ZB<br />sh9XuIs4nAHq3mv2wfYTp9+6iMZDkWTlzzd5Lb2/yceXt/6IhXevtAPrc8DXTW2Q<br />Cw/t28cnR61Syl0KwSI+xZabRd2HfjssbUgPABEBAAG0GWFub255bWFydCA8bm9u<br />ZUBub25lLmNvbT6JATgEEwECACIFAlA4VXECGy8GCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMB<br />Ah4BAheAAAoJEFTV/qu2mw5nlzEH/03tD06lEBaBpKvRCVhaxV0Uz466wkI4kbfW<br />LhXGmYhmbrGaKryYmoSoa11E9mmxBeG4ktyj6GbtqFDm/tJ81OBGdSvNIg/T5vXJ<br />LIIY51mOHzgYVmbqOpGQ8oVJxWd3FCasZX589U1kYmGu3Pf5gEPfFe7COzoFJuTF<br />IDHp53cG7BSeYRRPqDI7EXM0OkFNaRJQ2M62zPxsY+OMT1Im/uNlPDTMxQVk6K7z<br />2/bIPwa4QLMy263+l/UktaddwVxlEfHqk3xx5DMAY3wzCYoFHbvc2b8U22V+mg6j<br />BC0AqW7UBk9v3s1jhP0UTEy7DH4AOcyQqjk3f8gDCAEjjmveBDA=<br />=ji7C<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Why don&#039;t you have a forum acct yet?? I&#039;ve heard of you as a vendor but i guessed you&#039;d have a forum acct by now, just a lil suspicious when you have only 2 posts and you&#039;re supposed to be a vendor?<br />I hope I&#039;m wrong but just wanted to make sure everyone&#039;s cautious<br /><br />MMM

				MMM,&nbsp; I do not normally frequent the forums because I already maintain an excess of customers simply operating on the basis of making sales directly through the site, I personally think forums as a reputation arbiter are inferior to the feedback system in SR.&nbsp; I spent many years doing business on a number of forums and really I gotta say that silk road as a site made me feel most comfortable as an arbitration platform, lacking the normal drama associated with forums, allowing me to efficiently do business.&nbsp;

				You should PGP sign a message and post it. Long time buyers, with a forum history of course, who have imported your key on the SR will be able to verify you as who you say you are.

I also have shake and bubble hash but I dont have ISO hash. All my strains right now at are their best. Message me here or IM me with Torchat for more details.<br /><br />:)

				Thanks for the love and inquiries. Here is my profile page in SR: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d5b724d665.....<br /><br />I normally do not do bulk but am open to it now since I am not flooded with orders giving me the availability to do a few QP deals. I have grams if you want to check out quality first that you can purchase. My pot is found in dispensaries and anyone who tells you that is wet is straight up lying. I don&#039;t have 100% feedback only bc of the few people who buy from me and then try to scam me and get free product saying lies about my product or whose intention is to hurt my rep thinking that will increase their own sales. Its frustrating since I try to be as fair as possible and as honest as possible with everyone and I hope that most people can see through the occasional scammer troll who tries to hurt my rep which is really messed up since I am trying to make a living here honorably by providing a product that I strongly belief in to people who do not have access to it in their respective states.<br /><br />Now that silkroad is back up I will like to do business there and hope to see you all soon.&nbsp; <br />
