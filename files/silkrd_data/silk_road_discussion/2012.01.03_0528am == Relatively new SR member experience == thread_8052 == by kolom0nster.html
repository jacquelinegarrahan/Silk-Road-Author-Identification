				I&#039;ve been meaning to write a few words about my initial experience on SR.<br /><br />I found this place through the infamous Gawker article last summer.&nbsp; When I first heard about the concept I was intrigued, but never thought I would actually get involved and was a bit skeptical that this place even existed.&nbsp; But on a basic conceptual level the idea made sense and I couldn&#039;t see why a place like this wouldn&#039;t exist in the current state of technology.&nbsp; <br /><br />A few months later my curiosity got the better of me.&nbsp; I decided I should read up on the Tor network, SR, BTC, PGP, and anything else related.&nbsp; Well actually I began the journey just wanting to see if I could access the site and see what was on it.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t really intend to go beyond that.&nbsp; It was very easy to figure out the Tor network and login to SR.&nbsp; I found myself in a wonderland of drug sales with many items that I immediately found myself interested in.&nbsp; I kept asking myself, Is this real, or is this some sick joke by an individual or by LE.&nbsp; I pondered this thought for weeks.&nbsp; I continued to browse this board and began learning more and more about every detail of the process.&nbsp; The more I learned, the more I realized how safe it could be if proper precautions are taken and if plenty of research is done.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used get-bitcoin and found that although the process took a little time, it was incredibly easy to do with a little patience.&nbsp; Tumble, tumble, and I suddenly have BTC in my SR account.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m getting really nervous and anxious.&nbsp; What vendor to use?&nbsp; So much data on the forum and a lot of contradictions.&nbsp; Do I go domestic for safety or do I go foreign for quality with more risk?&nbsp; I went foreign, Sent my address with pgp and waited.&nbsp; At this point my intention had escalated to &quot;I&#039;m going to see if this whole thing actually works&quot;&nbsp; and no intentions of anything beyond that. <br /><br />Success!&nbsp; 9 days later I&#039;m rolling on some of the best stuff I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; <br /><br />The process was so easy and amazing that my curiosity has now lead me to several other things and I&#039;ve had success every time.&nbsp; I have spent a ridiculous amount of time reading everything I can about all vendors and paying close attention as best as I can.&nbsp; I realize there is always risk but I think this can be mostly mitigated with some up-front research. I don&#039;t intend to go crazy with it, but my experiment has proven successful and somehow I&#039;ve discovered one of the most amazing communities around.&nbsp; I&#039;m very impressed with the level of respect and professionalism (for the most part) and it&#039;s refreshing to know that there are so many other people out there that value quality mind-altering experiences when done with proper knowledge and with proper moderation.&nbsp; I really do believe we&#039;re all working to make the world a better place.<br /><br />My mind is still blown as to how this all works, but I&#039;ve never underestimated the power of humans.&nbsp; <br /><br />In can only hope Silk Road lives on for some time!<br /><br />Kolom0nster

				&nbsp; Pretty much my story as well. I really love it here, been able to get things I thought I&#039;d never see again. Not only that but the professionalism in the vendors is outstanding, at least with the few that I&#039;ve dealt with.

				My story is also almost identical to yours. I feel like a kid in a gonzo candy store! But now I&#039;ve gotten a bit crazy about it all. Since I&#039;m not in a legal medical med state I want to try all of the strains available here. Now I have more weed and different than I can smoke for quite a while. It&#039;s great. This place is great!

				Mine too! with one small exception.....&nbsp; <br /><br />I placed an order and it worked great.&nbsp; I got really excited just like you guys are.&nbsp; I then had a bad experience with one seller called MellowYellow.&nbsp; Fortunately thorugh SR escrow I got ALL of my money back which just made me all the more a fan and believer in the future of the SR.&nbsp; I have had gread orders from The Usual Suspect, Vicodin and Toyotaman and plan to place a couple more orders today.&nbsp; Cheers my friends!
