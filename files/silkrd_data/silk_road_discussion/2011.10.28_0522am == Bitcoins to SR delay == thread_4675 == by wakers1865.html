				So last night I sent some BC to silkroad from mtgox and it took about 2/3 hours for SR to get it in my account. Tonight I sent more using the same BC address from last night. The site said I would get a new address but could still use the old one to send coins. I clicked on&quot; &quot;get new address&quot; but it never gave me one so I went ahead and used the one from last night. <br /><br />Well its been almost 5 hours and still no coins in my account but no a new address has popped up. I have read it can take 6-8 hours sometimes. Just trying to make sure I have not done anything wrong by sending to old BC address and now there is a new on my account<br /><br />help

				I transferred BC into my SR account yesterday from two different addresses. I always send one half first, wait for it to clear, then send the other half *just in case*. Each transfer took about two hours.<br />Also, I use a new SR address for every individual transfer. Can&#039;t be too careful.
