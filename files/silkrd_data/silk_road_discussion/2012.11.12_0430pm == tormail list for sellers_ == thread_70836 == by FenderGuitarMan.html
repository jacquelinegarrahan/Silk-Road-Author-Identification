				Most sellers show a tormail email address on their profile profile page&nbsp; in case site ever goes down, I sure wish I had made a list of all my sellers! Anyone know of such a list?<br /><br />I have faith SR will be back online soon, but in the meantime some of us are getting sick and need either arrange something with their sellers or find RL seller to hold off the sickness for a few days.<br /><br />FWIW I&#039;m in the north east and could use a RL hookup! <br />

				Honestly, I&#039;d go so far as to eliminating some of the less active, personal use only accounts. the point of this website is to spread useful medications and having everybody and their grandmother purchasing on here is eventually gonna bring a lot of unnecessary attention. DPR needs to think about whether it&#039;s worth the extra money he makes off commission (assuming he does, aside from paying employees&nbsp; --- net profit) or keeping the idea of silk road alive. I might be creating my own thread on this topic as it is something I think about frequently and truly care about.

				That&#039;s not very nice.&nbsp; Who&#039;s to say what &quot;active&quot; is. I don&#039;t want packages in my mail every day for discretions sake. That doesn&#039;t give you the right to judge how active I am or fault me for personal use. Bad idea IMO!

Eliminating &quot;less active&quot; accounts would turn SR into a B2B market.
