				Hi all<br /><br /><br />Allow me to introduce ourselves - my name is Chemdog and I wrote a post that started in a similar way to this a few weeks back... And then I dropped off the face the of the planet for a bit to deal with real world stuff<br /><br />Y&#039;see, I have been an amateur explorer of chemistry for a long time. I have indulged in lots and lots of various substances, both recreationaly and also in the depths of addiction. I have smoked, eaten, cooked, extracted and generally played around with every substance I could lay my hands on, both to explore and, in the past, to self-medicate.<br /><br />Though not without risk, this is my passion. From my initial lurkings here some weeks ago, it seems I am not alone in this and for that, my soul rejoices. Flowery words maybe, but this is exactly how I feel. It is the total opposite to the emotions evoked from the biggotry here in the UK towards people who think as I do.<br /><br />I logged on to SR for the first time last year. I really couldn&#039;t be arsed to go about getting the BTC together and buying in. I left the site and thought no more of it.<br /><br />But teh reseshun took its toll, as it did for many.<br /><br />Though I&#039;ve always explored the wonders of psycho-chemistry, I&#039;ve kept above board as much as possible. HMRC has had a lot of tax out of me over the years (they still owe me money actually) and I want to contribute to this society.<br /><br />Enough is enough. We are told to obey the rules, pay your dues and soldier on. Yet, those who insist we live this way do not adhere to the same standards. I&#039;ve known this for a long time, but my life of late has given me the utmost emotional proof that this is the case. <br /><br />As such, I have made some decisions which may seem trivial to you, the reader, perhaps, but have rocked my world.<br /><br />I&#039;ve watched this government and those previous grind this country into the ground, whilst they rape it&#039;s people for their money, their energy and their precious time here on earth. The shambolic inquiries that seem to go round and round here are a joke told more times than childhood Doctor Doctor gags. <br /><br />Bob Diamond... Fred Goodwin... They made off with more than I can hope for over a lot less. <br /><br />Whilst I am angry about this stuff, like many of my fellow country men and women, I do not blame them. Maybe I would have made the same decisions if I had been exposed to that power and given that opportunity also. It is easy to point the finger of blame and ignore the three that point back at you as a consequence.<br /><br />But it has given me much justification for my new work and for that, I am grateful.<br /><br />Having proved to myself that this works and thoroughly analyzed the risks involved, I have spent the last few weeks building the logistics that will allow me and my new partners to work here unhindered. This background work is almost complete and our first batch of product is ready for sample requests (please see separate thread).<br /><br />We seek to provide the highest quality products and service. <br /><br />We drink our own champagne and will not sell anything that we would not consume. <br /><br />We want the community to be safe so that we can continue to operate safely. <br /><br />I am a little nervous about posting this. I&#039;ve never dealt anything other than on a personal level. But I am excited too. This could be the beginning of something beautiful. Perhaps I am just excited.<br /><br />So, that&#039;s us and this has been one long assed introduction. If you read all of this, you have my thanks. If you didn&#039;t, lol, I get that and that is ok by me. :-)<br /><br />CD

				Thank you all for your kind welcome - really looking forward to getting stuck in here.<br /><br />In terms of what we will be selling, we&#039;ve only got a batch of commercial weed ready at the moment. I wanted to wait until we had some more variety to get started, but one of my partners is pushing on me to get this thing rolling.<br /><br />You can expect various flavors of amphetamines, opiates, entactogens and psychedelics, as well as some very lovely weed from our farmers.<br /><br />The next products that will be available will be a batch of Critical Plus, a batch of Pineapple Chunk and a very large batch of P.Cubensis. We expect these to be ready in the next 4 - 6 weeks.<br /><br />In addition, we can also supply some chemical pre-cursors such as ephedrine, phenylacetone (P2P) and we may even have some sassafras&#039;s oil knocking around.<br /><br />I have a large pile of Nicorette patches and gum next to me too if anyone wants those. :-)<br /><br /><br />CD<br /><br />

				Welcome chemdog. Love your style.<br /><br />Well fella, your view on politics and society in general is an increasingly familiar and common one. And one to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Fiddle the GBP out of millions and play your part in placing us in this economic situation and you get a pay off and maybe a few bad lines of press for your crimes. Wear a hoodie and steal a packet of fags and some Doritos whilst venting your fury at injustices in society and you get 18 months. Top job eh?<br /><br />
