				in my experience most pharmaceutical narcotics RETAIL for $1/mg. so getting $80/pill from a junkie is not unrealistic. IV users prefer oxycodone IR&#039;s b/c they are much easier to inject...most folks smoke oxycontin in my experience;hence Oxycontin are not as valuable in my experience. I would expect $0.50/mg if i bought the whole lot for resale. other buyers might pay more or less depending on desperation and availability. hope this helps.<br /><br />kymatt&nbsp;

				it&#039;s not paranoia.. it is common sense... you are offering up one of the MOST expensive drugs on here at about a 1/4 of the cost and you want to do it through the forums...&nbsp; excuse me for being somewhat skeptical and calling you out on it... <br /><br />this is not BMR or one of those other scam drug sites out there... this is Silk Road and we have procedures and policies in place to protect buyers and sellers alike.

				okay... lets give you the benefit of the doubt and say you are for real.<br /><br />How do you plan to complete the transaction...?&nbsp; you think someone is going to send you 100&#039;s or 1000&#039;s of dollars worth of weed or BTC &#039;hoping&#039; you will fulfill your end of the bargain?<br />the way we &#039;vendors&#039; accomplish this is through the escrow system... it is what makes Silk Road work and makes ALL the other drug sites a scam.<br /><br />There is NO safe way to handle your transaction so that both parties will be mutually protected. This is why selling or trading through the forums is discouraged if not outright forbidden.

				you don&#039;t have to give me the benefit of doubt i am for real !<br />got them sat right next to me, i not too sure how it works i know you got finalize etc but having not done a transaction on this site yet ( as the bud prices are bit more than my local source) . would i send them to another vendor and they act as go between , i know it costs just have a sellers account, and i browsed forum and saw other folk putting up product for sale so thought i give it a go , as i said they just doing nothing and would like to exchange for bud at a price where everyone is happy . how about i post picture with today&#039;s newspaper or something to prove i have the product i dunno , i read about this sight in the guardian couple of months ago thought i give it a try. all i want is btc or bud for them at a price that is cheaper than else where so as i said every one is happy . <br /><br />peace
