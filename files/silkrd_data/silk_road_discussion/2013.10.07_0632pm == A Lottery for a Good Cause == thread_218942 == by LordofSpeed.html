				If you haven&#039;t seen my situation: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=218847.0<br /><br />I am desperate to get on my feet, and this is a small idea I had to get some help and offer a great reward in return. <br /><br />Heres how to help and win big at the same time:<br /><br />1. Send .1btc to 16jjzsuen9gr7d8e9d16E4MoDryHfcCx44<br />2. Post here after sending<br />3. When the wallet reaches 1.1btc one of you will be selected at random to receive 1 bitcoin instantly!<br />4. Repeat<br /><br />I&#039;m trying everything I can to recoup after all the research and hardwork I put in to become a vendor and run my operation succesfully and safely for the people of SR and black markets all over. I&#039;ve come too far to just give up, so please help my cause and give your luck a shot!<br /><br />Thanks everyone and good luck<br /><br />-LoS<br />

				I may sound like a complete arsehole here but anyway...<br /><br />You understood the risks when you became a vendor, you should have been fully aware that at any given time your BTC could be seized or you are unable to gain access to SR. With this is mind, you should have been withdrawing your BTC from SR every week, at LEAST. If you did so, you would have some coin today, correct?<br /><br />To say you have no money to get going again is really stupid too. It shows you have put everything into your business without a care in the world, smart move. Pretty sure the first thing you learn in business is to not do this.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in a reply from you tbh.

Not only was I withdrawing my bitcoin, but I had my account set up utilizing the SR feature that instantly withdraws available balances to one of 3 anonymous wallets. I added a large amount to my buyer account to make a bulk order. The vendor stated to be shipping out Tuesday and I placed it on Sunday. No reply and never marked in-transit. Moved over the last of btc I had wednesday morning to order in bulk from a different vendor that was slightly more expensive. Moments later I got the seizure screen and never received either of the orders. <br /><br />2. I withdrew a large amount of btc to order bulk shipping supplies anonymously. I have a ton of $5.60 and $.20 stamps which I offered to sell so I could get some btc back. Once again, another example of awful timing.<br /><br />3. My sales took off extremely fast and in only a few weeks I was the #2 listing on page one for bestsellers in my category, which turned out to be a bad thing. I don&#039;t ship on weekends, so I had a ton of orders to ship out monday and hardly any inventory left for sale. I converted a large amount to usd and restocked the same day. Between monday and tuesday I sold out completely, including all of the inventory I had just purchased. I had orders with quantities as large as 39, 25, and 20 plus several smaller orders. I put the last of the orders in my drop Tuesday night. Since I shipped priority, Wednesday would have been when orders started to finalize, and we all know what happened on wednesday.. So although I respect your opinion, I&#039;m going to have to disagree. My business was booming and it was out of my control that every single piece of inventory I had listed was ordered in the span of 3 days. I had followed my business plan to a T and it was reflected in my success. <br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />All of my orders in escrow and in transit at the same time + restocked on shipping supplies + one large order where my previously reliable vendor flaked + one large order made just minutes before the seizure + portion of profits withdrawn for living and personal expenses + waiting for SR to return my bond = the ABSOLUTE WORST possible timing imaginable.<br /><br />Thanks for your input and concern though
