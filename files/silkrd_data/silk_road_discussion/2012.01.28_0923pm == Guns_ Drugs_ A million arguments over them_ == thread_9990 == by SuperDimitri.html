				Well, there&#039;s enough threads and debate going on right now to totally clog up the forums. <br />Most seem deadset that it&#039;s a conspiracy to bring SR down. Not gonna happen. <br />I love guns. I love drugs. <br />Whether or not guns should be allowed is completely up to SR themselves. <br />The debate is a moot point, as there are a trillion pro&#039;s &amp; con&#039;s to both sides of the debate. It&#039;s worse than watching multi-millionaires battle it out on CSPAN to be the next &quot;leader&quot; of a country.<br />I think we should all just chill, and wait and see what SR themselves has in store with this. They are obviously 3 steps ahead of everyone, at all times. <br />I&#039;m sorry a lot of you don&#039;t like guns. I don&#039;t like meth or heroin...I used to....but not anymore. They destroy lives, but it&#039;s not my decision to make for others. Just as guns aren&#039;t my decision. I am just a fellow TRAVELER of the Road. I am not the police, I am not the politicians. I don&#039;t make the rules. <br />All that said, I have read about 4 posts and many replies in the posts to know how you all feel. <br />Guess what? Guns WILL NOT be the end of SR. Period. <br />The &quot;unwanted&quot; attention, as you call it, is it really unwanted? Did SR themselves do a short interview with the Gawker fuck? Or was it a mod? If SR answers a question to some known reporter, I would think that SR knows what the fuck they are up to. <br /><br />If LEO really wanted to take down SR, they wouldn&#039;t try to sell guns to get addy&#039;s. They wouldn&#039;t do anything that has ever been mentioned on this forum. <br />Think of it like this. How do they stop millionaires from breaking the law? They freeze the assets. Now, would LEO really spend millions on tech and man hours to take down SR? If you think yes, then why wouldn&#039;t they just simply take that time and money, and start buying up all BTC&#039;s and freezing the market? It&#039;d be cheaper and easier than trying ALL the other paranoid methods I have read about. Even IF all 21 million BTC&#039;s were in market, that&#039;s only 115,500,000 usd. About 3 weeks cost for drug war in USA only. They could basically cap up the market in a month. Then, without any available BTC, how would SR work? <br /><br />All this said.....I think one of you brainiacs should shut down Gawker with some DDOS or something. Get on it! <br />Everyone just chill for a few days. It&#039;s not the end of the road ;)

				Thank you, Echo. Although, I did just read the 1st reasonable explanation why we shouldn&#039;t have the guns.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9969.msg93437#msg93437">Quote from: punchy on January 28, 2012, 08:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I dont think its a good idea to sell guns on Silk Road<br /><br />You get all this extra attention from the full spectrum of government law agencies, Homeland Security,&nbsp; ATF, CIA,&nbsp; FBI<br /><br />and what worries me most,&nbsp; these agencies could get Postal Service funding for super hardcore scanners for the mail, putting the tried and true drug trade through the ringer<br /><br />Bring it else where gagsta nip<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I copied this from another post. It&#039;s from user named Punchy. 3rd sentence changed my mind on this. <br />Although it cuoldn&#039;t bring SR down, it could add millions in funds to get high tech gadgets to scan our lovely&nbsp; mail. <br />I am now against guns on SR, lol!<br />But still don&#039;t think it&#039;s a Fed Conspiracy to bring SR down. I still hold to that.

				As of right now, 81% of SR members want drugs off of SR (<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9969.0). It is bringing unwanted attention however you look at it. Maybe we can revisit this subject in a few years. <br /><br />
