				The site hasn&#039;t been loading for me all afternoon and I don&#039;t know if the resolution center got back to me about extending my finalization period 3 more days or not.&nbsp; It was at 6 hours the last time I was able to check.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely been over 10 hours since then.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t received the product, so I shouldn&#039;t have been forced to finalize, which is why I requested a second 3 day extension yesterday.<br /><br />If it has auto-finalized, and since I put in a request yesterday for extension do you think this potential auto-finalization can be removed from my record?&nbsp; It&#039;s a $2500 order and I really was going to release funds as SOON as I received the product...<br /><br />-gg
