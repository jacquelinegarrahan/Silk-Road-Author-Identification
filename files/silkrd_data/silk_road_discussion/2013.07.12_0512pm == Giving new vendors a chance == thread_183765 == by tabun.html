				I was new once. Dragoncove gave me a chance. So I thought I&#039;d &quot;pay it forward&quot; and do the same with new vendors. I&#039;ve had mixed results, mostly negative experiences. For example, a vendor who shall remain nameless is &quot;trying to establish himself&quot; and &quot;was a vendor in the past&quot; that has 16 transactions and has been a vendor for 16 days now has not been online for at least 2 days now. I mention this because I ordered from him/her of course. I&#039;m beginning to think I&#039;m not being thorough enough sussing out these new vendors before I give them a try. Maybe I&#039;m too trusting or just unlucky as hell. I lost out big time with that piece of shit Charlie Must Thrive because prior to my order he was on every day and had great feedback. Yes, I fell for the &quot;FE for free shipping&quot; scheme! So, back to new vendors. In my mind, putting up a fee to become a vendor is reason enough to be diligent with your vendor account to serve your customers well, and therefore turn a decent profit. Maybe I just need a good kick in the ass and a reality check and need to stay with established vendors huh?

The 500$ dollar deposit is a damn brilliant idea, just like everything else on this site lol. I just became a vendor 2 days ago and I&#039;m starting out in a hole because of that 500, BUT it deters people from putting 100 down, scamming everyone for 200 then repeating. The refundable deposit is a great idea in my opinion, likewise with most ideas DPR has. He&#039;s definitely on a whole other intellectual level than I am, that&#039;s for sure. <br /><br />

				I try out as many new vendors as i can, you can pick up some excellent opening offers and the vendors are usually keen to please :)<br />Of course that does mean I sometimes get an incompetent idiot or a would be scammer, but with escrow it&#039;s safe enough :)<br />It also means you sometimes find the next big thing before everyone else jumps on :)

				I may be a bit too trusting at times, but I go with new vendors often. I raise an eyebrow but read through everything they&#039;ve posted and check that others have had good experiences with those new vendors. I figure they&#039;ve put money into the business by being a vendor, they&#039;re looking to turn a profit. If I pay them for a product I can reasonably expect that product to get to me, and if it doesn&#039;t then I have avenues to take via SR to get a refund of at least some of my BTCs. I never worry too much, because I figure new vendors want to stay in the game for at least long enough to get known for what they&#039;re selling.<br /><br />My taking a risk by buying with a new vendor is the same risk I&#039;m taking with existing vendors. There&#039;s no way to tell if a new or old vendor will go rogue and not ship orders, especially considering older vendors require some buyers to FE. I figure the risk is equivalent and everyone has the same stake to lose, so I might as well help out new vendors get their bearings.

				Right on plutopete, I think my trust is given to vendors who have offered samples or let experienced buyers review their product, that way I have more trustworthy people to go off of.&nbsp; I placed an order from Whitedreams for his coke and it was only because he was giving people the opportunity to review his product. He has great prices but the shipping takes quite a while due to the location hes in.&nbsp; I dont trust vendors with no feedback.&nbsp; They must put their product in the hands of buyers so they can get some reviews first.
