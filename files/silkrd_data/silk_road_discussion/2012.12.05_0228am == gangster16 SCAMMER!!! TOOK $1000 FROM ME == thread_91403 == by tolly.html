				gangster16 will be found in the money and services section. He tricked me as Into doing a trade for 82 Bitcoins and he was to send $1000 cash. I didnt know I needed a custom order to protect me and just went off his feed back. Now he refuses to communicate and has blatantly stolen my money.Dont let his feedback fool you he will selectively scam you like he did me. Im trying everything to get it back as its all I have for xmas.

				Thanks for letting me know. I cant believe I was so stupid to take his word, I didnt realise I should have requested a Custom Order. Ive notified SR, do you think their is any chance I will get my 82 bitcoin back? There is no official order between us,&nbsp; just messages and me sending him the btc

				Wow sorry to hear OP.<br /><br />So we shouldn&#039;t just go off of feedback to trust a vendor?&nbsp; I was under the impression that you couldn&#039;t leave feedback unless you had made an actual transaction, thus eliminating the possibility for people writing fake reviews for themselves.&nbsp; Is this not the case??&nbsp; That really makes me a lot more nervous about this place than I already am.

				Yeah- be careful with the feedback thing.&nbsp; The feedback on a vendor&#039;s page can be faked at any time and the lengths some of these vendors go through to do so, amazes me.&nbsp; Most vendors are cool as fuck, but plenty are out to get you and usually these are ones who have not been here long.&nbsp; Always check the forums for feedback from other customers.&nbsp; This can be faked too, but I found it to be much more reliable.&nbsp; BTC scams seem to be the worst on SR, so be careful.<br /><br />Good peeps with BTC I know of: CHronicCrew, SugarMAma, BlueSKy Traders.

				Be careful with vendors who have a few items for $0-2 and also have listings for hundreds/throusands They can easily buy a bunch of the free or cheap listings on alt accounts to pump up feedback and then scam people on the big ticket items, I&#039;ve seen at least a couple of people who are blatantly doing that.

				Thankyou all for your kind words and support without rubbing in my total stupidity of not requesting a Custom Order...Or any order... We had an agreement and he talked me through the process right down to transferring those precious btc like it was no risk what so ever and I trusted him. I just handed over those BTC&nbsp; because he talked slick and I trusted his feedback. 82btc and he promised to mail me $1000usd to Australia using usps priority international. Said he would have the tracking number asap.... Im a new vendor and took serious risk to earn that cash and it was my reup money. I earnt that btc by giving honest professional service to my customers.<br /><br />&nbsp;Gridlokk your a true gentleman, I appreciate your support and how much you want SR scam free too Thankyou my friend! gangster16 get of the SR.

Your own personal security, though? Maybe not so safe, not with MTGox. But if you&#039;re careful, they&#039;d never have to know it is SR-earnings.<br /><br />Note: Like everyone else(as far as I&#039;m aware), I highly discourage using MTGox directly, at least for someone in your position.
