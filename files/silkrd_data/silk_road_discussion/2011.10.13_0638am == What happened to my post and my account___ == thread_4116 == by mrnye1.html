				&nbsp;:&#039;( I have had the same problem.<br /><br />I was even on this morning, had a nap, just came back and ALL of my posts and threads are just gone. I did try and look for the post novocaine was on about, but I guessing it might have something to do with the DDoS attack.<br /><br />Is there any way to get that back? Are the mods back yet?

Yeah I&#039;m new, and you&#039;ve been here for a while, but check your tude at the door friend. This place should be a little more kindhearted and understanding than that hurtful mess you just threw at me. <br /><br />Fact is this forum is glitchy and someone needs to work some of the kinks out. I was being facetious in commenting about my account being modded, I&#039;m just the kinda person that poses questions in wierd ways. Sorry for the confusion, but at the time I posted this the thread about missing threads was not visible, so there was no reason to jump my case about it. All&#039;s forgiven though, I get angry and rant for no reason sometimes to. Believe me if I had found a thread that discussed the issue I was having then I wouldn&#039;t have posted, but I couldn&#039;t so I did.<br /><br />I have a RL JOB 40hr a week and get on here when I can do so securely so forgive me as well that I can&#039;t keep up with everything that goes on here. For instance, I had no Idea of a DDoS attack, because I was apparently working and even when I could log on there were chunks of stuff missing from the forum. If this is the type of response I&#039;m gonna get anytime I ask a Q then I may just use the forums to check out sellers before I buy and never ask another Q again. But the DDoS attack could definitely explain what was going on so thank you AMUSH for actually answering my question to the best of your ability without berating me for not reading threads that were not visible.

				Ok you are not being moderated. Check the last time any of the mods signed in.<br />There are 2 forums running for whatever fucked up reason that maybe. Who knows... SR is not saying.<br />Basically every time you load&nbsp; SR forum you will get either SMF version 2.01 or 2. (its down the bottom of the page)<br />So if you post in 2.01, that post is only visible in 2.01 if you post in 2 it is only visible in 2.<br />If you sign up, it will be to the forum version you signed up on.<br /><br />If it was me I would not be discussing much or sending PM&#039;s until we get some official response from SR as to what the fuck is going on or who is in control.
