				&#039;You can tell if it comes like that, or if it has been cut. &#039;<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t buy off anybody this clueless If I was you. Anybody who isn&#039;t 18 will probably also see a problem here. Especially if you believe it is true and not just spouting shit to sell your product. <br /><br />good luck, but pass.

				Hey I get it! I&#039;ve been using a long long time and especially about coke the bullshit is so think you can barely smell anything else.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to argue that I&#039;m selling real cocaine. Since I&#039;ve used it and you haven&#039;t (have you seen the photo of the gear I sell?)<br /><br />In fact, now you mention it I&#039;d be a little dubious myself, and it does kinda sound like the same shit I&#039;ve also heard 100 times before. Except this time it&#039;s true.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll let my gear speak for itself. Money talks, bullshit runs a marathon.... and all that.<br /><br />Wait until the feedback comes in. Fair enough?

				Unless he&#039;s scamming people, leave him alone. None of you have ever tried his product how do you know it&#039;s not what he says it is? Until you someone who has tried it says otherwise, there&#039;s no proof it&#039;s not what he says it is. If he has people ordering from him I&#039;m sure soon enough someone will report back with the quality.<br /><br /><br />And if you don&#039;t like the prices, maybe you should open up a vendor account and sell us coke for what we all want to pay? The vendor is the one taking the risk, they get to choose the prices. LEA goes after sellers, not buyers.

				welp ok you got me, im not actually annoyed at idreamofjeannie im actually annoyed at people willing to pay 350-400 aud for coke, i dont even care how fucking pure it is even it was carved as flakes off the side of manuel noriegas ass cheeks people are fucking idiots paying this much for yayo. as a comparison foreigners will pay 100 usd on the fucking strip of las vegas for a solid gram or less than 50 bucks usd on the streets of anywhere else in usa. you guys are getting raped and this sort of shit encourages it.<br /><br />go fucking nuts promoting amongst your high flyer finance spas clients but anyone with a brain will be importing via mail themselves if they can handle the 2 week wait without imploding.

				Works out to about $420 AUD ..&nbsp; but somehow the buyers aren&#039;t laughing at the stoner joke&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />If anyone really is buying (and not just the vendors first few shill orders + feedback) please grab the SCOTT test kit for cocaine and share the results. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ffbec710c1<br /><br />Your DrugBuddy.

				Shit_Hace is spot on. The prices in australia for charlie is disgraceful.<br />Aussie SR sellers should be selling it for much cheaper. If you have a lot to sell, sell it at $150, if its 90%, then $200. <br />Problem with charlie is everyone jumps on it. <br />Damn i&#039;d buy some from the USA anyday instead of here. I could buy 2g&#039;s cheaper than buying 1g here.<br /><br />But if its the postage security your worried about, then i understand... :P<br />

If it can be crammed into a USPS box, you buy it overseas. Importers are not passing on any of the savings they get from the dollar going from 60c to parity. The aussie retail customer are sheep getting sheared.

				Yeah I&#039;d seriously consider getting a reagent test and post the results.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to claim top shelf and ask top shelf prices, then you have to back that up with something more than &#039;just trust me&#039;.

				I took a shot on this vendor yesterday and ordered 4 points to try it out . <br />Price is high but local stuff here even if you are connected is in the $300 a gram range.<br /><br />Anyway, happy to report this stuff is excellent. I&#039;ve tried every local vendor on SR and half a dozen overseas ones including some of the highest rated and I can absolutely say this stuff is better.<br /><br />I used an ez tester just to make sure and the stuff came up dark dark brown indicative of very high coke content.<br />I know for some its insane spending that sort of cash, but I&#039;d rather have the good stuff much less frequently than a lot of the &#039;average&#039; stuff floating around because we all know coke today isn&#039;t the same quality as it was 25 years ago.<br /><br /><br />

We cant help our geographic location which is the main factor behind the huge price per gram. Why does it upset you, are you paying $300usd+&nbsp; for cut to shit coke? We do if we buy local, we dont have a choice.
