				Gold, rent a safety security box, and do the responsible thing so I don&#039;t lose my hoom or any of my assets to just buying large quantities of presumably highly addictive drugs that are goin to keep me penniless from committing so much money to drugs on the spot.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather have some tangible commodity of trade if/nand WHEN the use of FIAT currency falls out of our favour or just when these fastest growing commodity slows down in their insanely increase in value right now, coming out with several 1000% return on a simple $1000.

				Practical answer?<br /><br />Spend it all on quality MDMA from a reputable vendor. When bought in bulk, it&#039;s very very cheap - like $20/gram. In most places in the US, real MDMA sells for $15/$20 a pill easily and is hard to find.<br /><br />Just some basic math:<br /><br />* With $1000 you can buy 50g of MDMA in bulk<br />* You can make 50g / 0.1 g = 500 capsules with that<br />* You can sell it for, say, an average of $13/capsule, ending up with $6500<br /><br />That&#039;s 650% profit.<br /><br />Aaaand that&#039;s how you turn into a drug dealer.
