				Hello friends,<br /><br />For a long time I&#039;ve wanted to experiment with sub-threshold LSD for creativity and other ideas but have never had a way to reliably dose it at very low doses.&nbsp; I would love to be able to get blotters dosed between 10ug-25ug so I can experiment and find the sweet spot.<br /><br />Has anyone else tried this, or know of a SR seller who&#039;s able to sell blotters that are accurately dosed between 10 and 25ug?<br /><br />I would love to experiment, find the sweet spot where I can still be completely normal and then try having a day at work on it :D

				Yeah, it&#039;s usually referred to as &quot;microdosing&quot;, and I think it&#039;s great!&nbsp; Nice replacement for a cup of coffee in the morning : )<br /><br />The good news is - you don&#039;t need to find any low-dose blotters.&nbsp; The trick is that LSD is completely water-soluble, so just buy a small glass vial, stick some tape on the side, and mark it with 10 equally spaced vertical ticks, one per dose.&nbsp; A vial with a 4 dram volume is a pretty perfect size.&nbsp; Buy distilled water (important, as non-distilled water will destroy the acid), pour it to the top of the 10th marking, throw one ~100ug hit of acid in there, and shake it up.&nbsp; When you&#039;re ready to dose, shake it up again, pour 1/10 of the vial into a spoon and let it absorb in your mouth for a bit before swallowing the water.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend trying to get ~10ug per microdose - 20ug makes you feel a bit trippy and brings the effects more into consciousness, whereas the microdose tends to be more subconscious and subtly energetic.<br /><br />A great article called &quot;The Heretic&quot; came out in July that everyone should check out: http://www.themorningnews.org/article/the-heretic (edit: search in the article for &quot;How many of you have heard about micro-dosing?&quot; toward the bottom to read about the microdosing study)

				Ya, great info! I&#039;m not sure when I&#039;ll be able to get around to it, but I&#039;ve always been curious about possible benefits to micro-dosing with LSD. Thanks for the run down saul, seems like the perfect method.

				Low dosing is quite possibly the greatest thing ever. I hate how I have to all sneaky and pay for something that used to cost 2 bucks for like 300 ug. This is stupid, I want a lifetime supply.

				I&#039;ve been thinking about this for a while and I finally have the words to put to my thoughts. I haven&#039;t read the article yet, but my first question is about tolerance. At such small doses, and lets say a person takes several microdoses a day, would there be a problem with tolerance buildup?

If you take 10ug, then the next day you&#039;ll probably have to take 20ug to get the same effect, the next day 40ug, and then 80ug, 160ug and so on...&nbsp; am I right?

				Microdoses of 10-15 micrograms have been reported to cause no tolerence buildup on doses of one a day.<br />By all accounts there&#039;s no need or point in taking more than one a day (unless you want actual changes in perception or over-threshold dose)for micro-dosing purposes.

				Why would anyone wanna do micro-dosing?&nbsp; Like a medication of something? I don&#039;t know&nbsp; :-\, IMO, it might be risky and very dangerous if you take more than you think and then you go driving of something without knowing that you&#039;re gonna trip in a couple of minutes... I wouldn&#039;t do it. I prefer to get the psychedelic experience without doing any daily activity...
