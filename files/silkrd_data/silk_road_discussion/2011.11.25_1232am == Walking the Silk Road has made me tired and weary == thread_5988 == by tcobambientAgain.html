				So I&#039;m thinking about making a couple of purchases in the next couple of days but to be honest (and I know some of this has been my fault) I haven&#039;t had any good luck.&nbsp; Got phished, lost passphrase to my wallet and lost coins and then sent bitcoins to a wallet that I couldn&#039;t access.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m gonna give it one more shot.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my idea.<br /><br />Delete current Wallet and any associated files on my computer<br />Download new Wallet<br />Buy bitcoins from Get-Bitcoin<br />Not sure if I should just keep my bitcoins in my wallet or if I should transfer them to Instawallet?<br />Change password on SR<br />Transfer coins to Silkroad<br />Change password on SR again (of course these will be kept safely)<br />Make my purchases<br />Hope no bullshit happens and my &quot;stuff&quot; arrives safely.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thoughts?&nbsp; Anything I&#039;m missing or should do differently?

				I just made my first order recently, and it was an overwhelming success. I&#039;m sorry you&#039;ve had bad luck. Here&#039;s some advice:<br /><br />- bookmark the real link to sr. if you&#039;re using the tor browser bundle, it&#039;s obvious how to do that.<br />- yes change your password and wallet there.<br />- instead of putting the bitcoins in your own wallet, why not just have get-bitcoin send them right to an instawallet? and do a bofa deposit if you are near one (who isn&#039;t?). that&#039;s safer, imo. get a new one and bookmark it, write it down, and/or store it as a draft in tormail<br />- wait for get-bitcoin to transfer the bitcoins to your wallet<br />- transfer those to your new sr wallet.<br />- make a purchase from high-ranking sellers; these are the crafty, experienced ones that do this daily and rarely have their packages seized.

				I didn&#039;t think about just having my coins sent directly to Instawallet.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll do that instead of dealing with the bitcoin wallet.&nbsp;

				Oh yes indeed, walkin&#039; the Silk Road can wear a body out.&nbsp; When first starting out I had my Bitcoin exchange account hacked &amp; lost about $70 of Bitcoins.&nbsp; There was absolutely nothing anyone could do, I was just shit outta luck.&nbsp; <br /><br />If there&#039;s one thing that I&#039;d suggest it would be use a password manager like KeepassX or Figaro&#039;s Password Manager (FPM is just for Linux while KeepassX can be used on Windows or Linux).&nbsp; You can store the web addresses for sites as well as the usernames &amp; passwords for those sites.&nbsp; The only password you&#039;ll have to remember is the password to open the password manager.&nbsp; Keep backups of your password manager database, make a really long password for the password manager, and *never* forget that password.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I&#039;m going to Silk Road, the Community Forums, or any Bitcoin exchange where I have an account, I always use my password manager as a reference.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve learned the hard way to keep my usernames and passwords stored safely.&nbsp; I&#039;m still a little paranoid even though it seems like I have everything set up the correct way.&nbsp; &nbsp;
