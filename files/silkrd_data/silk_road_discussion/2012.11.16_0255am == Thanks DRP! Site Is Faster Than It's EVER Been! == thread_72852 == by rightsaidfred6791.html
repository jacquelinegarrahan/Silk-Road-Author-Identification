				With all the naysayers and douche bags spouting all their lame BS, I just wanted to say Thanks to the people that make the SR possible.<br /><br />Honestly, It&#039;s working faster for me than it has ever worked! I was able to deposit a few BTC yesterday during the window of time the site was up and even place my orders. Sure, I couldn&#039;t log in for most of today, but I DO have a life. So I came back this evening and was able to log in just fine and see that one order is already in transit and the other is processing. <br /><br />Also, the site is working flawlessly for me and fast as hell! So, Thanks DPR and team!<br /><br />I just wanted to throw some positivity in the mix so it might catch on and all the negativity can finally start to die down.<br /><br />Peace!

				For me it&#039;s fast as you described, however I&#039;m getting session problems.&nbsp; I&#039;m being logged off frequently and the login page keeps giving me a three number captcha, which I can&#039;t login with, I have to refresh until I get a complete captcha

				Everyone saying DPR was an &quot;ass-hole&quot; or an &quot;incompetent c***&quot; are surely biting their tongue...<br /><br /><br />I had faith Roberts would pull through, now I have proof - the site is running super fast for me on my terrible internet connection.
