				Psychosis creeps up on me around the 18 hour mark. Depends on the stimulant though. Too much dopamine / not enough sleep makes eddie&#039;s brain hurt.

When I take more than 200 mg of MDMA I start to hallucinate stuff &quot;inside&quot; the eye wiggles, but if I straighten my eyes out they go away. Usually I just trance out for a while and when I focus again I realize that that person I thought I was talking to is really a painting on the wall or a person on TV. With MDA, I haven&#039;t personally experienced it, but I&#039;ve talked to people who saw full on patterns on the walls with their eyes open and their mind focused, which is more psychedelic.
