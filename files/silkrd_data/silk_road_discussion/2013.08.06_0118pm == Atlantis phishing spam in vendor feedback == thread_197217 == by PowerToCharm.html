				What does it mean? How did it get there? I doubt that some hack would actually buy a $900 qp just for the opportunity to leave spam as feedback...

				Why not?<br />Buy it on silk road sell it on Atlantis at a markup...kill two birds.<br />They have been spamming the newbie section, phishing.<br />&nbsp;Lol Atlantis is gonna self destruct trying to get more members...by design their market plan is evil.<br />Even for Sith standards.<br />At first they seemed like they might actually be a alternative to Silk Road, but with their antics, no way I want anything to do with them. I&#039;d never be able to trust them to let my btcs sit in a wallet like I do on SR, much less the escrow system. Personally they slipped from an up and coming market to a bag of dicks and I&#039;ve got no use for a bag of dicks.

				Do the spam feedbacks link to the actual Atlantis site or to a phishing site? I have read posts where people describe their SR accounts being hacked and their pending orders being finalized early. At first I couldn&#039;t imagine anyone (except possibly the vendor?) having any reason to finalize someone&#039;s order, but of course it would allow them to post the spam feedbacks.

				This is happening when a buyer and some cases vendors are creating accounts on Atlantis via the phishing link with the same credentials as their SR account. This then leads to their SR accounts being hacked, any orders in transit finalized and the feedback you see with the Atlantis phishing link included. There are even some vendors listings now up with the phishing link, if you see it please report it so the admin can deal with it.<br /><br />

Obviously this is not the case and never will be!<br /><br />As you can see by the length of time it took me to post here along with my post history of reporting such links we are very much on top of this and have even changed out login page to remind users to check for the correct URL which should always be &quot;atlantisrky4es5q.onion&quot;<br />We don&#039;t advertise here and the only time I make my presence known is when a topic like this pops up again. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=197217.msg1418517#msg1418517">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on August 06, 2013, 01:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is happening when a buyer and some cases vendors are creating accounts on Atlantis via the phishing link with the same credentials as their SR account.

It works in the same way that onion.to and onion.sh services work but captures your data as it passes through
