				Hello everybody.<br /><br />What is going on with the refund rate? How is this calculated? I&#039;m a little pissed right now to be honest.<br />I&#039;m a member for almost 1 year now and NOTHING went wrong so far and i spent a total of more than 200฿ on 23 transactions.<br />Now my first package didn&#039;t arrive and I contacted the vendor, we came to a satisfying solution for both and I went into the resolution center.<br />Afterwards I checked my stats and what I saw there was shocking me: Refund rate: nearly 9.5%! What the heck is going on?<br />My purchase was only around 8.5฿, that means a little more than 4% but not nearly 10%.<br /><br />What&#039;s going on there? Is this intended?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />PS: I changed the numbers to protect my innocence of course.

				The most recent transactions have a stronger effect on your stats.<br />From buyer&#039;s guide:<br />&quot;The statistics are weighted toward the present, so you must keep up your good behavior, but if you have a bad streak, you can recover by doing well going forward&quot;<br /><br />

				Ok thanks for the fast reply.<br /><br />So - theoretically - if I would wait long enough the rate would drop? Or is it only losing weight if i have &quot;newer&quot; purchases?<br /><br />thanks

				I don&#039;t know that but my guess is that it will stay the same until you get more transactions.<br />If it is under 10% I don&#039;t think you ll have a problem with most vendors.
