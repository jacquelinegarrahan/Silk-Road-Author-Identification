				I&#039;m wondering if anyone else who has recently bought from him are having issues with shipping slowness. I had my 400$+ order shipped last tues, and it still hasn&#039;t arrived. I&#039;m kinda getting a little nervous considering I can&#039;t see how it wouldn&#039;t be here by now considering I&#039;m from the US just the vendor I ordered from....ugh..I FE&#039;d too so that makes it even worse, and his communication doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s the best considering he&#039;s been swamped <br /><br /><br />any help?

				Well he had over 300 transactions, and the majority of the reviews were fine, I don&#039;t see any reason with why FE would be a issue. <br /><br />Just SR has been down, and getting in contact with him has been the worst of my troubles. Doesn&#039;t seem like he checks the forums that much either.

I will definitely take all this into consideration beforehand. I really didn&#039;t like the idea of FE in the first place, and he&#039;s kinda pushy too when it comes to FE he messages you to FE after shipping. but lets just hope once SR gets all working again I can figure out where my package is and what not.........

				I&#039;m also waiting on an order from him from quite some time ago. The problem is at the time he was the only vendor carrying the goods I wanted so if you wanted them you had to take the FE risk. Only vendor I&#039;ve dealt with I&#039;ve had to for and I&#039;m not liking it.

Probably zero refund. He can say anything knowing SR can&#039;t do anything about it. <br /><br />Also, no one ships FEDEX. All USPS. <br /><br />When SR comes back up, likely it won&#039;t mean anything with regards to your order. Your vendor likely won&#039;t communicate with you for some time. What&#039;s on his profile page won&#039;t given you much hope either. He could live in the area affected by Sandy.&nbsp; Lots of people in that area have been out of power for 7+ days. Most are back now though. <br /><br />Consider your order a loss. That doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t get it. But if you do, you&#039;ll be pleasantly surprised. :)<br /><br />Simple rules to live by on here:<br /><br />1. Never finalize early. If there&#039;s only one vendor who has what you want but requires FE for it, then there is no vendor who has what you want. <br /><br />2. Never finalize early. There&#039;s a number of variables which are out of your control. FE adds yet another variable that is outside your control. <br /><br />3.Never finalize early. The only people who lose money are those who FE. Those who never FE, only lose time.&nbsp;
