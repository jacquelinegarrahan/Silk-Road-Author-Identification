				A major flaw to me has become clear through watching SR trends. Sellers can build up amazing reputations and be genuinely good guys, but when it comes to closing up shop, there is a problem.<br /><br />If you were a seller with a great reputation and had saved up a ton of money and were ready to get out of the business, how would you do it? You could just announce to the community that you are leaving, and peacefully go on your way and probably be missed by many. However, there is nothing stopping the vendors that are retiring to pull off one big scam before they go. After all, a bad reputation is meaningless to a seller who no longer sells. If a seller wants to get out of the game for good, there is absolutely nothing stopping them from going out with a bang. This can be avoided by never finalizing early, but as many of us know, good deals can mess with our thought process and drive us to do silly things. People are going to continue to finalize early, and continue to be scammed. We will surely continue to see more trusted sellers pull off big scams as they part ways with the road. The temptation of money is far too great for even some of the best of people to resist. Unfortunately that is the nature of the business we are in.<br /><br />Moral of the story is trust nobody! Sure that statement sounds pretty grim and lacks faith in humanity, but the only way to eliminate the possibility of being scammed is to trust nobody but yourself. That being said, there are a lot of great people on here that i love and trust, but always be wary and cautious. Money makes people crazy! You never know, stuff can happen, people can change. <br /><br />PEACE<br /><br />

				Yeah, there have been numerous times when major, highly ranked vendors pull massive exit scams. You are right to be cautious.&nbsp; Lots of vendors on here seem really nice, and I&#039;m sure some/most of them are genuinely decent human beings, but it&#039;s impossible to know for sure behind the mask of anonymity. I&#039;d say don&#039;t spend more money on here than you can potentially stand to lose. Every time I make a purchase, I figure I&#039;d be upset if I got ripped off, but it certainly wouldn&#039;t be the end of the world.

Fuck all that shit. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I think most of the guys in the forums are cool as shit and I think the same of some of the sellers. But I be damn if I FE and give up my heard earned money because I&#039;ve had 20 successful orders with you. Treat every order like it&#039;s your first, be cautious and stay in escrow. It&#039;s not there for shit&#039;s and giggles. <br /><br />For those that lose money, it&#039;s hard to have sympathy for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;

There are no #1 sellers on SR, unless YOU have personally been dealing with someone for at least a year you really cannot say if they are super honest and trust worthy and even if they are remember to never spend more then you can afford to lose.

				What i suggest is contacting the vendor prior to placing any order to verify that he does not require you to FE. Tell him/her your stats etc, and wait for them to get back to you. If by some chance they want you to finalize early dont order. <br /><br />This will save you time and heartache of having your btc held up in escrow for a couple of days just to find out the vendor requires early finalization from you. Also be patient. There are good, honest vendors on the road who will gladly take your order if you take your time and find them. <br /><br />It seems like a lot of people see a deal for their DOC and they become so excited they order and finalize early because they&#039;re creaming their pants in excitement. Keep your shit in check, and dont make it easy for these scammers to get your hard earned BTC.<br /><br />Just a suggestion, take it or leave it, but this is the only way I will place orders from here on out. Good luck all.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				It is a circle that is hard/expensive to break out of it seems (FE). I am new here and from what I have seen the &quot;best&quot;prescription opiate sellers want FE for newbies. Now of course you can just not do it but then that&#039;s it, no tabs for you at a potentially ok price. I&#039;m sure there is a solution but damned if I know what is is.

				Tony could have left for a million different reasons. Perhaps he was only making a small percent on the products he sold, in which case cashing out thousands (easily, thousands) would be more worth it than peddling his wares for another several months. Perhaps he lost his connect, and didn&#039;t want to waste time and energy finding a new one. Maybe he&#039;s sitting in a jail cell right now.<br /><br />In any case, I&#039;m glad he&#039;s gone. The number of &quot;finalizing early for THE MAN&quot; feedback comments was sickening. The praise he got only served to dissuade any idea of making negative comments directed toward him. Now any time we see a vendor getting put on a pedestal, we need only to casually pass by and mutter &quot;Tony&quot; and remind everyone that not a single person on this site can be fully trusted, let alone praised like a god.<br /><br />Perhaps the next time we have a sale, all orders placed during the sale can&#039;t be finalized early or something.

				Are we talking about Tony76 here? I can&#039;t believe a person would do such a thing. That&#039;s why superficial honesty and hypocrisy go hand in hand. But the solution has alerady been mentioned numerous times. Don&#039;t FE!

				I can count on one hand how many vendors I would finalize early with after almost a year. Escrow is here for a reason. If you have not personally worked with this vendor at least once or twice before there is no reason to FE. <br /><br />Many of the vendors here are stand up guys and are not looking to screw anyone, but don&#039;t be stupid, after all this is the drug trade, not walmart.<br /><br />There is also the sentiment of &#039;Never buy more than you can afford to lose&#039; which I wholeheartedly agree with. For most people these are recreational substances. Some may be necessary pharms but by and large by ordering from someone you don&#039;t necessarily know you are taking a risk. This said, why would you forfeit your only path of recourse because they say so? Remeber buyers drive a market, if enough people simply refuse to FE then those vendors (If they want to continue to do business) will eventually need to change or they will eventually fail.
