				So, it turns out more and more of my friends are into coke these days. I used to sell mdma back in the day, and I was thinking about maybe making some cash by getting some bulk here and re selling it by the gram.<br /><br />But the only thing is I can&#039;t figure out why it&#039;s so damn expensive on here, normally I can get it for about 40-50GBP per gram and some of the prices on here are immense. like 70 odd quid for .5g. Is it just because the quality is really that good??<br /><br />What would be the best way for someone like me with say about 300quid to get started? should I cut it? (I can&#039;t see any other way of making any money)<br /><br />Thanks in advance for the help.

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be able to make any real money reselling coke from here unless you lived in Australia or cut it to shit, same goes for opiates as all the prices are steep as hell. No vendor seems ready to drop the price since people are still willing to pay $100+ a gram.

				I have only bought coke a few times here on the Road. It is fairly expensive, but it was a lot better than anything I could get my hands on in real life. I think the price is high because of the convenience and the size of the market itself. Market dictates price and if people are willing to pay it, the sellers can charge high prices. <br /><br />Personally, I couldn&#039;t see how you could make money from selling coke that you buy on here. That is because I would never cut a drug. It pisses me off when I get drugs that have been cut, so I wouldn&#039;t do it to someone else. There is a lot of money to be made from selling the MDMA from here, but that is a no go if you&#039;re clients aren&#039;t looking for that!

				Prices on SR do not reflect street value.<br />Think of SR as taking out the risk factor from doing street deals and adding the ease of amazon like transactions.<br />You&#039;re paying for a service here.<br />

And then we went and bought a gram from somebody else we know. <br /><br />We gave a gram of our coke, and a gram of the street coke to another friend and told him to try one on Friday and one on Saturday.<br /><br />He took ours on the Saturday - and said that it was much, much stronger. <br /><br />Now, think of it in a kind of percentage scale, if llyods brothers coke was 80% pure - when it is cut 4 times, each gram becomes 20% pure. <br /><br />Meaning, that the street coke was around 10%, maybe less. <br /><br />I really suggest you don&#039;t cut anything though, just buy the coke in bulk if you can - two, three ounces at a time and you&#039;ll get a decent discount and then just flog it at a 100GBP a gram, give your mates testers so that they know it&#039;s worth the money.<br /><br />The thing with coke heads, especially in the UK, is that a lot of people take it because they think:<br /><br />&quot;Oooo I am on Cocaine, I&#039;m going to let everyone know because it is expensive and people will think I am rich/cool as fuck&quot;<br /><br />So when you tell them you&#039;ve got better quality stuff, and that it costs even more and that a single 100mg line will turn them in to Tony Montana - they&#039;ll be knocking your door down looking for the shit. <br /><br />That&#039;s just my .2 cents anyway, mate. Good luck with whatever you decide to do in the end.
