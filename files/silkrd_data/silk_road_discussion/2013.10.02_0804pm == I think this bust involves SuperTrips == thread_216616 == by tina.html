				Definitely not sure, but I just find it strange how he scrapped his operations, &quot;set up in a different area&quot;, came online for less than 2 days, then had his vending privileges banned. I think he got sloppy somewhere along the line. Someone... maybe DPR... maybe someone else, caught it, and banned him hopping that LE wasn&#039;t about to blow anything involving the SR wide open.

				SuperTrips MUST have been the #1 vendor.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure DPR and SuperTrips were within excellent communication

				Thoughts? At the same time that SuperTrips left the largest Ecstacy bust in Belgium had just happened, spanning from Netherlands to Germany and Belgium. He said on his page that the way his operation was set up was that in the case that something like this did happen, he was as far away from the operation that it could be relocated. .. (He pressed and made his own MDMA, Pills.. etc).<br /><br />Anyway did you not read the court documents? SuperTrips was the Number 1 vendor.. ok, but does that mean DPR automatically gives SuperTrips his information on who he is?<br /><br />Please stop with the stupid threads...&nbsp; &nbsp;:o
