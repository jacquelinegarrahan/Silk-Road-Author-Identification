				After reading a lot of the forums over the last fortnight I&#039;ve noticed a lot of disparaging remarks about newbies.<br /><br />Just had a good laugh at a thread where a (nameless) renowned vendor was slagging off all newbies for being ignorant about drugs, LOL. He&#039;d had some bad reviews and this is what he is putting it down to. He speaks as if because you are new to SR you must be an idiot - hilarious really.<br /><br />From what I have seen so far on SR my overall impression is that there are a lot of people on here who are quite drug-naive. Yes, there are plenty who know there stuff too but an awful lot more who clearly know fuck all - and guess what? Having been on SR for a year makes no difference to how much you know about your drugs, obviously. <br /><br />It&#039;s cool though, kinda. I mean it&#039;s the same really irw. Give the newbs a break ffs...makes you feel like the sharks are circling.

				Can&#039;t argue with that. Being on a board like this gives you a feeling that this is the entire universe. Newbies here are (sometimes) new to the SR world, but not necessarily to the drug world. Maybe getting a little flack is just part of the Newbie initiation. Getting flack is also a general characteristic of most internet interactions. No one gets seriously hurt here, but you&#039;re right - there&#039;s no need to be nasty about it.&nbsp; I think people get irritated with us newbies when we ask questions that they&#039;ve seen asked 105 times. Me, I just get irritated by assholes. And CAPS LOCK PEOPLE. And idiots. And... well, I guess mostly everyone.

Nowhere. You misread my post. I&#039;m sure that some newbies can be as stupid as the quotes you provide above infer. A section of society is dumb, we know.<br /><br />The vendor I referred to was not slating newbies for their understanding of how SR runs, but for their lack of drug knowledge. Understand?&nbsp; Cool..<br /><br />My point was, and is, that being a member of a deepweb market does not necessarily mean that you are in any way more drug-aware than someone who has been a member for five minutes. That notion is, clearly laughable as the 5 minute member may well have say 20 years more drug experience irw than the veteran member. <br /><br />Cheers

That is hilarious and sometimes true. <br /><br />But you have to get that a lot of newbies are geeks and not used to street dealing etiquette which often applies here since many vendors are also street dealers. <br /><br />Plus newbies get nervous. It&#039;s a very exciting new world for them and very little roadmaps to follow. <br /><br />If there&#039;s anything newbies have to learn is how to leave feedback. Many think it&#039;s like eBay or Amazon or whatever e-commerce site. It&#039;s not. If you get your drugs, leave 5/5. Any gripes, write it in the commentary box. If nothing ever arrives then a 1/5 is appropriate. The ratings in between are not for newbie use. Even the veteran SR buyers know better than to use them. <br /><br />So remember newbies; if you get your drugs... 5/5. If you don&#039;t... 1/5. That&#039;s it. Always contact the seller before leaving a 1/5. If something bothers you about your transaction... leave a 5/5 but comment about what bugs you in the comment field. And talk to the seller. <br /><br />And don&#039;t FE. Meaning don&#039;t finalize until AFTER you receive your merchandise. <br /><br />Newbies who use 2/5, 3/5, 4/5 generate a LOT of HATE among vendors.

				I don&#039;t think there&#039;s as much &quot;newbie discrimination&quot; as you perceive. I won&#039;t lie, if a newbie comes into a thread of an established vendor and complains about the product and claims to have not received, some eyebrows will be raised. But that&#039;s kind of how it goes. If you want to lose &quot;newbie&quot; status, post forum reviews of every vendor you buy from and for every product you receive. That will tell people you are someone they can trust.

And you leave him a fucking 3/5. <br /><br />Also there&#039;s a 4/5 that was left for salsify that I&#039;ve been checking on (I&#039;m OCD like that). The feedback reads &quot;leavin a 4/5 rating rite now becuz i havent opend package yet..but shipping was fast.good communication..if buds are dank and weight is rite...will be back to leave a 5 rating for salsify&quot;<br /><br />Still 4/5 ten days later. And anyone who has dealt with salsify knows damn well that the buds were indeed dank and the weight was on point. But the kid still can&#039;t be bothered to change the 4/5 that he shouldn&#039;t have left in the first place. I can definitely see how that would drive a vendor mad.

				Discrimination shiscrimination.. this is the big leagues.&nbsp; Check your vaginas at the door because fucking up here can ruin a lot of people&#039;s lives, especially your own.&nbsp; Not to say that people should try to be jerks.&nbsp; We were all newbies once, but the newbies that annoy me are the ones that you can tell read NOTHING and have done absolutely no research about the site, protocol, GPG, Bitcoin, or anything in general.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is it&#039;s a fine line between protecting yourself and your fellow travelers and trying to be helpful without being an enabler.<br /><br />AND like kittenfluff said, even the discrimination that does exist on these forums is pretty mild I think.

I&#039;m not even a vendor and this still gets on my last nerve. Can&#039;t remember the vendor but I recently saw a 3/5 feedback that said (paraphrasing) &quot;Product is good but $30 is too high. I should&#039;ve known not to pay that much. My fault, I guess.&quot;<br />Well, you did choose to pay that much and the vendor fulfilled his end of the bargain. And you leave him a fucking 3/5. <br /><br />Also there&#039;s a 4/5 that was left for salsify that I&#039;ve been checking on (I&#039;m OCD like that). The feedback reads &quot;leavin a 4/5 rating rite now becuz i havent opend package yet..but shipping was fast.good communication..if buds are dank and weight is rite...will be back to leave a 5 rating for salsify&quot;<br /><br />Still 4/5 ten days later. And anyone who has dealt with salsify knows damn well that the buds were indeed dank and the weight was on point. But the kid still can&#039;t be bothered to change the 4/5 that he shouldn&#039;t have left in the first place. I can definitely see how that would drive a vendor mad.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Maybe if SR did not try so hard to be so different from everything else.&nbsp; &nbsp;These people arent givig you a 4 in order to screw your business&nbsp; Whether it is what companies actually want or not, 100% of the SR&#039;s customer base has been trained to leave feedback like that by every other main stream company.&nbsp; So I think you should not be blaiming the idiot newbies....&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead, recognize that the rating system here is ass backwards and people, both newbies and vets, are gonna screw it up from time to time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mean, in the real world, if a product was priced too high for what it was, that would absolutely factor into how I rate that, so any place other than sr, that is a valid review.&nbsp; And with the second one, if I have had better, (and lets face it, SR is higher grade than street, but still only average for the prices here)&nbsp; I would not have went back and said it was the best I have ever had.<br /><br />SR Rating system needs to chance, is all there is too it..&nbsp; &nbsp;It needs to be something that makes sense, something that does not equate lousy sellers to the best (why everyone is so crazy about their score), and something that a newbie can come in, and use with ease because it is not an exact opposite of every other rating system they have seen.<br /><br />Furthermore, if we are really only dealing in 1 and 5s in the current system, why the likert set up at all?&nbsp; When not two options, received, did not receive?&nbsp; &nbsp;When you put a scale in front of me, I expect to actually rate something, not answer a yes or no question.<br /><br /><br />THIS is why I think people are having so many problems with newbies....&nbsp; &nbsp; The rating system screws everything up.<br /><br />I do ask, keep the ratings in mind in real life though..&nbsp; &nbsp; Not always this convaluted, but I lost my real life job because of customers making complaints they do not understand they are complaining about.&nbsp; For instance, person leaves a 4 because it was a lil pricy, but the 4 tells everyone else you screwed them other on SR.&nbsp; In real life the person reports they wont return to the sture, but the survey doesnt ask why, only assumes you are the reason.<br /><br />So, everyone, just keep in mind how ratings effect other people, and maybe sr should consider a system that makes a little more sense...&nbsp; Did it arrive, y or n<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was it stealth, y o r<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; correct order&nbsp; &nbsp; y or n...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; any further comment?

He speaks as if because you are new to SR you must be an idiot - hilarious really.<br /><br />From what I have seen so far on SR my overall impression is that there are a lot of people on here who are quite drug-naive. Yes, there are plenty who know there stuff too but an awful lot more who clearly know fuck all - and guess what? Having been on SR for a year makes no difference to how much you know about your drugs, obviously. <br /><br />It&#039;s cool though, kinda. I mean it&#039;s the same really irw.

Eventually they may be very knowledgeable.&nbsp; This is not the street....these people don&#039;t want to get robbed etc so they deal on here. Its ok to be a newbie, everyone is a newbie at something :)<br /><br />DOC

Jumping in with both feet witheyes closed and a fist full of btc because you&#039;re so damn excited to be able to buy drugs from your PC isn&#039;t cool. Drug dealing is all about being cool right?&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br />Aaaaand on topic:<br /><br />As for newbies being treated like they know nothing about drugs.... can&#039;t say I have experienced that, yet. Mind you, I have been sticking to the topics I have 15+ years experience in. Maybe when I hit the DMT or Ket threads I&#039;ll get some flaming. Mind you, I&#039;m a geek who loves to research before I post, usually.<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit old fashioned and&nbsp; think that many problems maybe avoided if folk took more care over their grammar and expressing themselves more accurately in their posts. A forum newbie who may actually be very knowledgeable on a certain druggy subject may slip through the cracks and into the &quot;Clueless Newbie Jerk&quot; bin because he cannot be bothered write a legible sentence.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s textbook bullying.&nbsp; People try to manipulate others and force their opinion onto others by shaming them, nasty comments, trolling, etc.&nbsp; biggest mouth and biggest assholes get heard first at the table in real life.&nbsp; <br /><br />I often wonder how many people here are strategically posting to increase sales and protect their personal interests.&nbsp; If vendors wanted to be creative, they would organize a welcome wagon crew to greet noobs before they get trolled or bitten and turned into trolls. . <br /><br />This way, noobs get trained, coaching/support, guided into the process. Turn noobs into buying customers faster!&nbsp; Get them before the trolls eat them up or scare them away.&nbsp; I think some people don&#039;t like to share vendors with others.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I think we loose a lot of potentially good brand new members because of frustrations in the beginning. Most people I talk to IRL about SR say they gave up on it because its too complicated and time consuming to scan the forums all the time for the latest scammers.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, a lot could be learned by examining noobs, and the challenges they face. Moons are a goldmine of money and information. They are a valuable resource, not a problem child. <br /><br />Vendors could proactively organize welcome wagons to scoop up noobs in the beginning before they get settled on a favorite vendor.&nbsp; If you can jump in and be their first, and not worry about it because they were screened already by the welcome wagon crew - it would be a good business move.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m saying there is an incentive there to help out noobs.&nbsp; It could be done fairly and methodically.&nbsp; Take a noob under your wing for a few days.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done it myself and I&#039;m no pro, just the basics with PGP and TOR and getting coins safely.&nbsp; I hate to see people struggle. <br /><br />I think a lot of discrimination to newcomers is really insecurity.&nbsp; Some are afraid of noobs slowing the site down even more than it is and possibly making their vendor sell out of heir favorite drug.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen it.&nbsp; It&#039;s like in real life too, where you got a street dealer surrounded by junkies who want to get in between you and the dealer somehow. It&#039;s hard to get to the dealer, friggin sea gulls and vultures. <br /><br />**** When I was a noob, I was recommended a vendor after a lot of research in the forums and looking at his feedback. Well,&nbsp; I got fake drugs sent to me.&nbsp; The vendor challenged me on it, because I had no stats yet.&nbsp; I was setup by the &#039;friend&#039; I made in the forum, who steered me to this sham dealer.&nbsp; I discovered later that two people were the same person.&nbsp; You can see why I like to help noobs get started. <br /><br />So, there are pitfalls everywhere for noobs. Many would say its paying your dues and learning experiences.&nbsp; <br />Just some thoughts from my experiences.&nbsp; I hope I didn&#039;t offend anyone.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;m an idiot and I just like to type and hopefully se noob will read this and be wiser than I.
