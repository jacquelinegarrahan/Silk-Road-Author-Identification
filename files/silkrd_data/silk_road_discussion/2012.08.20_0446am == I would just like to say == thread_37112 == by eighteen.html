				im really glad that the moderator banned &quot;assasination requests&quot; i heard about this site and ended up on some anarchist site, where they were talking about killing politicians...<br />im really glad that the site has the moral;es to ban that shit, because i dont wanna spend time with a ton of ander&#039;s breiviks. im all up for liberty buy and sell whatever, but when it comes to killing i am not game, im really glad the site master took that veiw as well. thats all i wanted to say, except im glad shit like this can be bought and sold

				Lol, yeah i got that, the liberty this site affords, is beyond belief and i will be buying once the price of bit coins stabilizes, i just didn&#039;t want to be on a place where one man could pay for another dead. how are people managing sales with the fluctuating price of bitcoins at the moment? thats my only concern

				Well from the vendors perspective the smart of us tend to hedge so the value of the BTC is pinned to the USD. If you are just a buyer the best idea to to buy a bit extra just in case it fluctuates and then you can always sort out your order. :)

All good vendors destroy records but obviously nobody can guarantee they do that. Personally I never even keep records to begin with, you just need to basically only buy from the reppin vendors.
