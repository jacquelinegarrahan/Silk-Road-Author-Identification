				Unfortunately I&#039;m one of those unlucky people who just recently found out about SR. Woe is me. I&#039;d reallllllly like to register to the market and end my green drought but the only access I can find is for member logins. If an admin can have mercy and register me with my user name and email I used here I would greatly appreciate it. If there is a link I&#039;m missing please PM me. A few years back I moved for work and have 0 connections where I&#039;m at. It&#039;s been harsh.

				There&#039;s a black market site that just opened up. I&#039;m guessing you&#039;ve probably came by it too in your searches. Problem is none of the sellers there have been tested yet. Only one has a positive review but that&#039;s because he was on SR. It&#039;s pretty hard to trust. Hopefully an admin here will have mercy.

				Yes, I am still having it. Basically I come to a screen that says join with two boxes underneath it and then an image verification box underneath that. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m using a bad link or not. If you would like me to post it just let me know.&nbsp; Thanks in advance. <br /><br />
