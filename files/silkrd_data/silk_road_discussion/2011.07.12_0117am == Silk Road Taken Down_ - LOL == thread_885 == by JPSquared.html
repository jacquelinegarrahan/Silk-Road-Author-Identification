				http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/309011<br /><br />&quot;Since trading BitCoins requires no personal information to be given out they became a popular way to pay for drugs on a website called Silk Road that has since been taken down. Senator Charles Schumer called BitCoin &quot;an online form of money laundering.&quot;<br /><br />I wonder if this article was written during a downtime or if the author is just a dumbass.&nbsp; Probably both. LOL&nbsp; But, hey, thanks for taking the heat off a bit.&nbsp; 8)

				Yes: Silk Road is definitely shut down for good, so the politicans won on this one!&nbsp; So sad, but that&#039;s the way it goes sometimes...oh well, it&#039;s nice they let us keep the forums up, so we can chat and fantasize.&nbsp; I guess LE can go home now, consider the job done!

				This is where sloppy journalism helps.&nbsp; There is a clearnet site to Silkroad which if not available can make people jump to conclusions.&nbsp; Personally I think that it should be replaced with a dummy &quot;domain seized&quot; screen unless there is actually something to announce.

				Hi guys, all new and shiny here. I found thru Bitcoin.com the place was still trading. Off topic but really curious what other use somebody would have for bitcoin apart from coming here or some such place? Had my thread locked by admin because we were entering illegal activity lol

				The Silk Road has officially been taken down.&nbsp; All Silk Roaders have been arrested and are now in prison getting butt raped by Bubba.&nbsp; Why, Senator Joe Manchin himself arrested me along with 100 ATF, DEA, and FBI agents.&nbsp; As for Silk Roaders outsides the United States, the government killed them all with predator drones (and everybody else within a 200 m radius of each silk roader).

				There are lawyers would *love* this case.&nbsp; Just trying to explain bitcoins would drive judge and jury to madness.&nbsp; And all the definitions of &#039;crime&#039; would start falling apart.&nbsp; This would be a fun case.&nbsp; On the other hand, you get caught with product, then it&#039;s just plain old possession, or possession w/intent, depending on quantity.&nbsp; Why I say, most important thing anybody dealing quantity can do is get a bail bondsman who they know and can get hold of quickly.&nbsp; Once you make bail, yer a lot less inclined to cop a plea, which is what most cheapo lawyers try to obtain.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t plead out on this one, and you could probably beat it.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I say too much emphasis is placed on the technology and protection of tor and VM&#039;s and not enough on keeping one&#039;s mouth shut, and good packaging, which are where our real weaknesses lie.&nbsp; LE doesn&#039;t have unlimited funds and unlimited time, to sit around studying IP addresses and going thru computers, so I hear a lot of misplaced paranoia on here.&nbsp; The only busts I&#039;ve heard about, or &#039;close calls&#039; have been due more to bad packaging, or a tendency to blab.
