			<dd class="postbody">
				About 6 months ago my vendor account was hacked, apparently.&nbsp; I absolutely know my passphrase.&nbsp; It&#039;s impossible to guess, and at over 50 alpha-numeric-symbolic-upper+lower case passphrase, perhaps an expert could tell me the odds of brute force.&nbsp; But the issue is that I have contacted SR customer service numerous times and they have asked for information and I have given it to them.&nbsp; The only thing I didn&#039;t know was my SR wallet address.&nbsp; Fast forward to this time....<br />I still don&#039;t have my vendor account and my kids are about to go hungry.&nbsp; I just had to drop out of grad school to get a job at a gas station for crying out loud.&nbsp; I have relied on selling IRL to get by but stopped once I found SR.&nbsp; SR customer service has gotten back to me repeatedly, but I am still waiting.&nbsp; I sent them a message begging them to let me start selling again.<br />I&#039;m going to skip meals to buy a new vendor account.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I suck.&nbsp; I did so much wrong.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve learned my lesson.&nbsp; I just thought you all should know how long it&#039;s taken.&nbsp; 6 months.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a bit too long.&nbsp; Had I known it would take this long, I would have bought a new account months ago.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s my fault.&nbsp; Any advice is appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.

				Don&#039;t know why you posted this unless you&#039;re looking for a handout and, if you are, you posted on the wrong forum. There&#039;s a large hole in this story and that is why in the fuck would you wait so long to get another vendor account when it&#039;s only 150 bucks? Makes no sense. You&#039;re outta luck. Starving your kids cuz you&#039;re too cheap to buy another account? If this story is real you still won&#039;t be getting any money. So you&#039;re either a piece of shit or a liar or both. Whatever it is, go fuck yourself.

It&#039;s 150 fucking dollars! You&#039;re gonna go 6 months without selling anything over 150 bucks? Did you even do that math before making that decision? And if you really couldn&#039;t, then what were you making before, like 100 bucks a month? Like I said, if you&#039;re telling the truth, I still have no sympathy for you. If this is real, it was stupidity and irresponsibility on your part. Seriously, the fuck are you doing with kids anyway if you&#039;re a drug dealer? I couldn&#039;t see how anyone in their right mind would think it an appropriate course of action to have children when they&#039;re actively engaged in illicit activities and probably will be for the foreseeable future. Why the fuck would you do that to the kid when he/she doesn&#039;t have a say in it? All I&#039;ve gotten from this is you&#039;re either very stupid or you&#039;re a genuinely shitty human being. That&#039;s IF you&#039;re telling the truth. If you&#039;re not, you&#039;re just a leeching piece of shit. Like I said, either way, I&#039;d prefer you don&#039;t come on this internet black market forum giving us your (bullshit or no bullshit) sob story. If you&#039;re a parent, then provide for your kids. Don&#039;t go whining to other people about how you need money and you&#039;ve got kids to feed and blah blah blah bullshit. Welcome to the fuckin party we call life. I don&#039;t know what else there is to say.<br />
