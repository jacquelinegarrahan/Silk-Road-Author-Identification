				Does anyone know why the “Prescription” sub-category is missing from the “Opioids” group on SR ?<br /><br />As most of you know, it used to read:<br /><br />Opioids<br />&nbsp; &gt; Heroin<br />&nbsp; &gt; Opium<br />&nbsp; &gt; Prescription<br /><br />But it seems the “Prescription” option is gone???<br />

				It looks to me like they finally fixed the browsing so prescription stuff only shows up under the Main prescription category and not in two separate places.<br /><br />I always thought it was dumb/annoying that I had to look in both places to make sure I was checking all listings to get the best deal.&nbsp; And must&#039;ve been annoying for vendors to list these things twice to make sure they could get the most exposure.

				I was wondering the same thing. Seems that the Opioids category is now entirely devoted to heroin, and a few listings of opium. Either that or everyone selling opioids is out of stock atm, lol.<br /><br />I&#039;m just hoping that they successfully transferred all of the opioid listings over to the Prescription category so we&#039;re not missing anything. Before, it seemed to me that the Prescription category really only had a few random and duplicate Opioid listings, I usually wouldn&#039;t even bother browsing it. They should at least make a category devoted to Opioids under Prescription, instead of just &quot;Pain Relief&quot;

				Hey, thanks for the replies . . .<br /><br />Yeah, so apparently all of the Oxy Prescriptions are now listed in the full &quot;Prescription&quot; category instead of being listed as a sub-category under the &quot;Opioids&quot; group?!?<br /><br />So, it appears that we now have to scroll through hundreds of listings for Soma, and Tramadol, and Codeine to zero-in on the good stuff ! <br /><br />Sure, THAT makes sense ?!?&nbsp; &nbsp; ::)

				The categories tree is being worked on. Hopefully when we&#039;re done it&#039;ll be much easier for you all to find the products you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />Libertas

				Libertas &amp; the rest of the SR Admins,<br /><br />I see that the &quot;Pain Relief&quot; category under &quot;Prescriptions&quot; is now broken down by all of the different types of pills/chemicals/compounds!<br /><br />I&#039;d bet that most everyone is going to really appreciate the improvements!<br /><br />Good Job !!!<br /><br />Take care,<br />Bullfrog6288<br /><br />P.S. also kudos on the 4-digit change to the BTC&#039;s as well as the 1-month, 3-month, 1-year, and totals breakdown on our &quot;Purchasing Stats&quot; !<br /><br />

				Funny, did not even notice the tree expansion because I just look through &quot;Drugs&quot; so I don&#039;t miss a thing.<br /><br />I love the progress that the admins are making, because you have no idea how much money the site, vendors, and customers are loosing because things are not categorized as they should be.<br /><br />Just think google. Search is the life force and function of any e-commerce site, period. That&#039;s why google controls the internet, per se.<br /><br />Looks good so far.<br /><br />Now, if we could have a check box for &quot;international only&quot; and the ability to search products by individual countries, revenues would fly through the roof for all involved. <br /><br />Put it this way, the less time I spend searching, the more time I can spend purchasing.<br /><br />I believe everyone from DPR to the newest SR customer can understand that.
