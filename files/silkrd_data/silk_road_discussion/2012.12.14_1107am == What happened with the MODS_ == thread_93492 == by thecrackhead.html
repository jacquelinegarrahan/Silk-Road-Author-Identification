				Holy crap I&#039;m back! (very marginally, sadly)<br /><br />After a string of ridiculous misfortune involving the loss of several of my closest friends from this community, I have to say that I&#039;m kinda disappointed with the moderation since I was abruptly taken away from here.<br /><br />Seriously. Disappointed. Especially with regards to the btc scam bullshit posted everywhere.

				I sincerely hope that I&#039;m not violating his confidence here, but I kind of feel like I need to say something in Guru&#039;s defense... so I&#039;ll let him do it in his own words, as I think it speaks quite well of him.&nbsp; Guru, if you happen to read this and don&#039;t want it shared (even though your account dropped to 0 posts and then got deleted), I&#039;ll gladly remove it -- just say so.&nbsp; Anyway, he decided all the effort he had put in here hadn&#039;t been appreciated and didn&#039;t want to waste more of his time.&nbsp; Personally I can&#039;t blame him.<br /><br />The last PM I received from Guru:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Guru</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: SelfSovereignty</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Quote from: SelfSovereignty on 2012-12-07 05:25:11AM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LOL... Yeah, I remember that quite well.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t realize until after clicking &quot;respond&quot; to point out it sounded real and he really needed to get it off there fast, that I had also accidentally bumped the poor guy&#039;s identity back to the top of the new posts list.&nbsp; Felt like an idiot for not PMing him instead after that, but hopefully I&#039;m the only one who ended up getting a glimpse at the real identity of a new SR user&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You&#039;re welcome; I&#039;m happy to help, but it&#039;s no great deed on my part.&nbsp; I work in the tech sector and like talking about stuff I think is cool.&nbsp; I think Bitcoin and SR are cool, so -- there you go :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for the sentiment all the same though, Guru.&nbsp; The work you mods put in is just crazy, and it&#039;s definitely appreciated by at least some of us.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for the kind words.&nbsp; As you have been kind, I thought I would drop<br />you a brief line to let you know of the reasons for my departure -- I just<br />didn&#039;t to disappear and leave you hanging, as it were.<br /><br />I&#039;m leaving and not coming back. Why? Well, there has been a LOT of weird<br />shit going on around here over the last little while, with moderators being<br />stripped of their positions, without so much as a by-your-leave. I wrote<br />DPR asking about this, trying to get some clarification as to what the hell<br />is going on, and I never received even so much as an acknowledgement. Now<br />this has happened to me.<br /><br />Nomad_Bloodbath was a Global Moderator on here; he literally was with SR<br />since Day 1, and he was stripped of his position. He claims it was due to<br />a &#039;hacker&#039; who had it in for him. I don&#039;t know how one could ever verify<br />that, but there has been some weirdness over the last while, and just in<br />the last 24h or so, someone asked if the hidden moderators could take care<br />of a problem -- a vendor had posted an image with his GPS coordinates in it.<br /><br />You could use Google Maps and be looking at the guy&#039;s front door. I did what<br />I could to fix this, and within a few hours of that, I essentially find<br />myself booted as a moderator. No rhyme, no reason, no notice.<br /><br />I won&#039;t lie to you... I&#039;ve lost count of the hours I&#039;ve spent helping people<br />on here over the last 7 months or so, and being treated like this is just a<br />slap in the face.<br /><br />Frankly, I don&#039;t need this shit, and I&#039;ve made up my mind to leave and not<br />come back.<br /><br />Thank you again for your kindness.<br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />These guys put their hearts into building this community, and I know it&#039;s grown too large for the kind of personal attention old members may be used to or expect... but Guru deserved at least a short note of explanation.&nbsp; And don&#039;t try to tell me DPR has no need to even explain why somebody is no longer a mod.&nbsp; To be blunt, *fuck* that.&nbsp; It&#039;s human decency, and just because we&#039;re outlaws and drug addicts doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t have integrity and treat each other well.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying DPR even has a clue what went on, mind you.&nbsp; Who the fuck knows who did what.&nbsp; That last bit is just in response to grahamgreene.<br /><br /><br />P.S. - delete this post if you really want to, admins/mods.&nbsp; I won&#039;t post it again or get all miffed or anything.

				With the moderators gone everyone needs to take it upon themselves to take care of this place, I know we can&#039;t delete posts etc. but we can still help the noobs falling victim scams and such. It&#039;s not much but I sometimes get multiple messages a day from new members thanking me for posting my warnings that I like to do saying it saved them from losing money.<br /><br />It&#039;s not much but if it helps one person it&#039;s a win a in my eyes...<br /><br />Also, what does concern me is the random admins/mods popping up. I know we&#039;re not owed an explanation but I feel we deserve it when there&#039;s just random admin/mods popping up with a zero post count. Yes, I&#039;m aware this is probably just an old member with a new account but still a explanation would be nice.

				I&#039;m kind of wondering how long it&#039;s going to take for this thread to disappear... though so many people have seen it by now, that if it did get deleted... panic would surely ensue.<br /><br />I think the better way to handle this would be to let it die down slowly.&nbsp; Responding would open up the possibility for too many questions, outright deleting these posts has too big a risk of starting a serious panic when we all go &quot;oh, SHIT...&quot; and freak out, lol.<br /><br />So yeah.&nbsp; Probably just us posting here again &amp; again until we get sick of scaring each other, heh.

				Thanks to all who took the time to post what they know about nomad &amp; guru.&nbsp; <br /><br />Geez - I&#039;m kind of speechless ... especially since I finally worked up the nerve to PM both of them. That&#039;s why I logged on today. I wanted to ask them both wtf is going on around here &amp; to tell them that their presence is missed. Damn.&nbsp; So many people are gone.&nbsp; <br /><br />This place has not been the same since the big November debacle - weird shit IS going on. Movie night bothered me too, big time -&nbsp; then came to the realization that I don&#039;t know squat &amp; that if I&#039;m going to use this site that I need to defer to whomever is in charge.&nbsp; <br /><br />Very bummed about nomad, guru &amp; microRNA, they all helped me when I first got here.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be the same without them, it already isn&#039;t the same without them. These folks were&nbsp; / are part of the bedrock of this community, they helped to build this community into what it is today.&nbsp; They made me feel safe when I first got here and they ALWAYS made me laugh. I will miss them all very much.<br /><br />Hoping you will all come back or at least tell us where you&#039;re hanging out now - oh boo hoo&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(&nbsp;

				Its quite a world away from the actual site on here you know. I mean think on the site are getting faster, buisness is as usual. With burgeoning traffic onthe site which must be lliterally be growing exponentially I cannot fathom how much work that must be for anyone let alone someone having to carefully conceal their identity the whole time.

				Nomad, Guru and Micro were solid mods and are worth their weight in Bitgold to this community. And I trusted Pine and tried to learn the best security practices from him. Pine had invested so much time into the security of the community, why would she just up and leave without saying anything?<br /><br />One thing I feel becomes more apparent is that DPR is no security expert. What with the trouble he has with PGP and forgetting to sign important posts, and then the V movie night. These are basic things. Is Kmf (is that his correct name) about, it&#039;s a first for me but I would actually like to hear his input on this.<br /><br />Anyway, as someone already said, even if LE have taken over SR as long as you trust your vendor and always use PGP we should be OK, right???&nbsp; &nbsp;

One of the manoeuvres used to do gain that control is by working your way up to a moderator position over a year or two, and ensuring you pull your buddies up with you. This is something that DPR is fully aware of, and is likely protecting the community against. His/her suspicions may be unfounded, but what would you all prefer: a forum controlled by LE moderators masquerading as helpful community members, nipping debates and topics in the bud before they have a chance to turn into education or action, or a forum controlled by DPR and his/her Administration team (the members of which could all even be DPR him/herself)??<br /><br />Silk Road - and its associated forums - are more than just a place to &#039;score drugs&#039;. They are an idea. They are a proof of a concept. And they harbour a community that represents the biggest threat to the status quo that has existed to date. A community with very knowledgeable, very intelligent members, all contributing to the education of their peers and debating honestly and openly without fear of retribution or government interference. We&#039;re outgrowing the womb of oppression that we&#039;ve been confined to for decades; we&#039;re growing and finding our feet, and those at the top are beginning to feel the first tremors of those feet marching on in solidarity and resistance.<br /><br />This community, if we stick together and continue making it our goal to free ourselves from government oppression, if we stick together and continue our fight to once again make the government fear the PEOPLE, then perhaps - as a community with drive and conviction - we have a chance to free ourselves from our legislative chains once again.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let paranoia get the better of you! You&#039;re still here. I&#039;m still here. DPR is still here. Silk Road is still here. Our community is still here. Our IDEA is still here. Don&#039;t trade your freedom for the false sense of security that having moderators around provides. Rely on your own security. Act as though the system IS compromised, but keep your faith in the ultimate shared goal of freedom from oppression. Every purchase made in the underground economy - the black market - weakens their economic stranglehold over us. Every purchase made with Bitcoin weakens their economic stranglehold over us. Use this place, and Bitcoin, as a TOOL to fight injustice. But do it safely.<br /><br />And again, do not let your paranoia get the better of you. When you control your own security there is no reason to be paranoid. The fact that there are no moderators here, no people with the power to silence discussion, means that freedom prevails.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				One thing I&#039;ve noticed about this community is that it tends to be skeptical and suspicious to the point of paranoia, which you would think is a good thing, but 90% of the time people are spooked by the wrong things. Some examples. During the downtime, people were claiming that DPR was running off with their money. Their evidence was that they transferred BTC to their SR address and a few hours later saw it transferred out. They mistook the normal tumbler behavior for a conspiracy to steal their money. Another example is the guy who saw a uniformed police officer in a marked police car outside the post office and thought LE was after him. Do you really think LE would be that obvious? The more likely explanation is that it was mere coincidence. Cops sit in their cars all over town and that day a cop happened to be parked outside that post office. If it was an investigation against him, they blew it big time.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I think the de-modding and disappearance of some prominent forum members is too conspicuous to be a power transfer. If LE took over the site, I don&#039;t think they&#039;d be that obvious. The forum isn&#039;t that important, and they would want to make everything look as normal as possible, so why not leave the mods on the forum while concentrating their investigation on the main site?<br /><br />I have an alternative hypothesis, and this is why I&#039;m writing under an alt. We&#039;ll see if this gets deleted. <br /><br />It&#039;s obvious that several prominent people disappeared right around the downtime. I believe that DPR needed help fixing the site and they became members of DPR&#039;s team. Of course, they and DPR wouldn&#039;t want anyone to know they were members of the team. However, they would be privy to secret information about the site, and the best way to ensure they don&#039;t accidentally say something publicly that they shouldn&#039;t know was to say nothing. So they either stopped posting or their posts have slowed to a trickle.<br /><br />That may not explain everyone&#039;s disappearance, but I believe it explains some people&#039;s disappearance.<br /><br />As for the de-modding, who are these new admins? The team members were promoted and the old mods might have been in a position to figure out who they are. So they had to be demoted.<br /><br />If you think I&#039;m giving something away, chances are LE has already thought of this.

However, it does not take away from the legitimacy of the words that preceded it regarding security issues and freedom of expression, nor the core principles that this incredible marketplace operates upon.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=93492.msg660851#msg660851">Quote from: Limetless on December 15, 2012, 12:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Would you like a revolutionary flag with your revolutionary happy meal? :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />:P&nbsp; Does it come with a mini Ché Guevara bobble-head?

Their regular methods for fighting their &#039;drug wars&#039; (declaring war on inanimate objects and ideas is ridiculous, I&#039;m sure you&#039;d agree?) don&#039;t work when attempting to fight us. We are outside of their control; history shows that that which a government cannot control is regarded as a threat, and needs to be eliminated. They cannot hope to eliminate us, nor hope to eliminate the IDEA behind this place - hence we represent a major threat to them and the existing state of affairs, otherwise known as the status-quo.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=93492.msg660895#msg660895">Quote from: Limetless on December 15, 2012, 01:21 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lol and if you believe that then you really do need to be put out to pasture. ;D<br /><br />It amazes me how eagerly people overplay peoples intentions when they use SR like in this bit here - <br /><br />Silk Road - and its associated forums - are more than just a place to &#039;score drugs&#039;.

It is simply a means to experience things which one could otherwise not experience without it. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I do ENJOY my money, but it has no actual VALUE to me and I&#039;m incredibly glad of that. It is clear that money has a very high value to you; that is your prerogative though, which is no less valid than mine, and I respect your views on money. I simply think differently to you.<br /><br />Getting back to the matter at hand, however, I should think that you of all people would know how ridiculous it is to suspect something without any evidence to suggest that it is true. I vehemently defended your innocence when others implicated you in the v1ad1m1r scam simply because you&#039;re both British, both enjoyed working with money, and conversed now and again. There was no evidence to suggest that you played any part in that scam, yet people were calling for your head over it. All incredibly illogical and borne from hysterical paranoia, which had absolutely no basis or evidence to back it up.&nbsp; ???

It is that idea that has the potential to change how we conduct our day-to-day business. Silk Road won&#039;t be around forever, but it is a proof of concept that something like this CAN be done, and will be done again. DPR him/herself stated their reasons for wanting to set up a place like this. They don&#039;t need to attempt to engage people with &#039;revolutionary spiel&#039; - it does not benefit them at all business-wise to do so. He/she does it because they do not lack the courage of their conviction. And that is obvious from the marketplace that they have provided here.

As I mentioned in my original post in this thread, a member of LE would attempt to make themselves a valuable, highly regarded member of this community, encouraging a degree of trust as it seems like they are &#039;looking out for you&#039;. LE has no interest in the buyers, and the ones tasked with attacking Silk Road likely have no interest in the vendors. They want positions of trust here. As such, I highly doubt DPR would choose a valuable member of this community to join his/her team of Administrators or tech-heads.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Well... let&#039;s see if a little logic can help us out here... So we have several possibilities:<br /><br />1) DPR is still DPR.<br />2) DPR is not DPR, because...<br />&nbsp;2a) DPR is now Leo<br />&nbsp;2b) DPR is now whoever the prior DPR handed the name off to<br />&nbsp;2c) DPR was forcibly replaced because of the high income that requires zero work, basically<br /><br /><br />So in what circumstances are these possible, and what actions do they necessitate on our parts:<br /><br />1) I have no idea.&nbsp; If he was as clueless when he tried to start this place as he has been the past month or two about basic security practices, I simply cannot imagine it ever working. To even know enough to trust a hidden Tor service to keep you hidden (or to even know they fucking existed), the man would need to know more than he&#039;s exhibited in the past month or two.<br /><br />&nbsp; Conclusion: I don&#039;t think this is possible.&nbsp; This is my personal opinion.&nbsp; If I&#039;ve forgotten some critical piece of evidence, by all means, speak up.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think I have.<br /><br />&nbsp; Solution: there isn&#039;t one.&nbsp; The old DPR did a great job.&nbsp; The new one can&#039;t even be bothered to answer a question here and there let alone do anything useful.&nbsp; The end.<br /><br />2a) The government has enormous resources.&nbsp; And contrary to what a number of people around here seem to think, there are a great many geniuses who play for their side.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if they found a way to track down the server and just staked it out until somebody walked up to it.<br /><br />&nbsp; Conclusion: possible, but unlikely.&nbsp; Occam&#039;s razor would suggest that linguistic forensics and profiling identified him, but really, it doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; We all agree -- there&#039;s lots of ways Leo could be running the site.<br /><br />&nbsp; Solution (buyers): do not order from anyone who uses a PGP key with less than 2048 bits.&nbsp; And for God&#039;s sake, don&#039;t ever send your address to the site unencrypted.&nbsp; My favorite vendor uses a 1024 bit DSA for his primary key (DSA cannot encrypt, it can only sign) and a 512 bit ElGamal subkey (which is what&#039;s used if you encrypt with his public key).&nbsp; This means I can no longer order from him.&nbsp; Fuck.&nbsp; I suggest you all take a quick look at your own vendors and decide if you want to risk it or not.&nbsp; Once you make that decision, it&#039;s business as usual.<br /><br />&nbsp; Solution (sellers): use better fucking keys God damn it; 2048 bits minimum.&nbsp; Use a DSA/RSA or RSA/RSA primary key/subkey combination.&nbsp; Again, DSA cannot encrypt, it can only sign.&nbsp; Whichever of your keys CAN encrypt is what&#039;s used to do so, so if your subkey is 512 bits and it&#039;s used to encrypt, our &quot;encryption&quot; of our addresses is virtually useless.&nbsp; Bad for us, bad for our freedom, therefore bad for your profits.&nbsp; This needs to be fixed if your key is broken.&nbsp; Then it&#039;s business as usual.<br /><br />2b) the replacement was not properly vetted.<br /><br />&nbsp; Conclusion: he&#039;s not competent to protect himself let alone anyone else.<br /><br />&nbsp; Solution: Act according to 2a, the situation is no different.&nbsp; If he can see your address, consider it a threat (whether out of maliciousness or ignorance doesn&#039;t change the fact that in both cases, it&#039;s a threat).&nbsp; After that, though, it&#039;s -- yet again -- business as usual.<br /><br />2c) DPR deserved better, but maybe he let it slip one night in a bar to the wrong guy.&nbsp; Who knows.<br /><br />&nbsp; Conclusion: The new replacement is incompetent.<br /><br />&nbsp; Solution: see 2a.&nbsp; Then business as usual.<br /><br /><br />... see what I&#039;m getting at here?&nbsp; Expand your precautions if you aren&#039;t acting according to 2a.&nbsp; It&#039;s a small hassle that&#039;s well worth it.&nbsp; You&#039;re investing in your own continued freedom.&nbsp; This is dangerous business we all conduct every single day here.&nbsp; It gets comfortable, we laugh about it, but they&#039;re trying -- right this second -- to stop all of us from laughing for many, many years to come.&nbsp; They are out to get me.&nbsp; They are out to get you.&nbsp; And yes, they&#039;re working together.&nbsp; You are not paranoid.&nbsp; Protect yourself.&nbsp; No one else will.<br /><br />And then... as far as I&#039;m concerned, it&#039;s business as usual.&nbsp; Critiques?

				I received the same message from Guru as SelfSovereignty posted, if you look at Guru&#039;s profile he&#039;s a guest, meaning he&#039;s deleted his account, losing him is a big loss for our forums, I enjoyed reading his posts, he&#039;s a very knowledgeable person with a good heart, I will miss him, and I&#039;m sure many others feel the same way too. There are no known moderators or spam busters presently on the forums, everyone has been stripped. The only moderators left, as such, are the administrators Inigo, Flush, and of course DPR (even Indica|Sativa has been stripped), who are always invisible. It&#039;s DPR&#039;s right to run the forums whichever way he/she/they wish to, stripping a long serving moderator or spam buster without reason is harsh, but we need to accept this is not a normal forum due to its nature, and there may be a very good reason why DPR needs to keep it private. I presume the mass stripping went in line with the addition of captchas, no way could three very busy administrators keep up with the sheer amount of spam previously, there may be hidden moderators we will never know about, and certainly whenever I report spam it gets deleted, sometimes very quickly, indicating an invisible presence. Wherever pine has gone, I hope she&#039;s okay, she provided an invaluable service to our forums. On the positive side the spam has drastically decreased, I haven&#039;t seen the pages and pages of spam there used to be, it&#039;s still annoying, and the occasional newbie will fall for it, but it&#039;s a great improvement. I&#039;ve got nobody to slip a coin to now when I feel they&#039;ve done a good job moderating or spam busting, next time that coin will go to the spare coins thread, I’ll try to help as many genuine members as I can with it. Despite all the moderators and spam busters being stripped I hope some of them stay active as they are great contributors.

				SelfSovereignty I&#039;ve been having the same internal dialogues I&#039;ve personally ruled out LEO as&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe they would allow this site to continue to run if they had gained access.&nbsp; Past behavior of how the government dealt with online poker, mp3s, torrents etc.&nbsp; I figure if they had acquired SR they would shut it down Loudly, publicly and quickly.&nbsp; I personally based on knowing the character DPR&#039;s storyline am leaning towards your 2b that the name/operation was passed off to a new DPR with the old DPR lurking in the background assisting with the transition but I think the November downtime was part of a hand off to the new DPR and he is way more worried about suring up the market side of SR and will hopefully stray over to the forums soon to get more acclimated.&nbsp; In my mind this explains the dismissing of the mods, I know if I had taken over I&#039;d want no-one to have anymore privileges than absolutely necessary, I&#039;d lock everything down and slowly loosen the reins with my people in place.&nbsp; But hell what do I know.....In the meantime I&#039;m also being a little more security conscious a bit paranoid....mods disappearing,&nbsp; no DPR posts that I&#039;ve noticed, and because it seems there where some wholesale changes.&nbsp; Interested to see what happens next.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sysco88&nbsp;

				I normally just post one liners to try to help other but i have an opinion here and I must try to convey it from my head to virtual paper. These are just my own thought and opinions and are not meant to be argumentative or attack any one person or there own opinion. Please excuse grammar and spelling and my ramblings below!<br /><br />Well I am surprised by the lack of information from SR. about this topic.&nbsp; We went thru a lot of paranoia with all the down time and the one thing that forum members had said.&nbsp; Keep us in the loop.&nbsp; This will not stop all the conspiracy theories but it would help the seasoned veterans here have piece of mind. I read this post to learn that the mods have been sidelined without an explanation and days latter there is still no answer. In my mind there are reasons to keep things behind closed doors..... you have an ongoing problem that has yet to be completely resolved....&nbsp; The lack of information suggests there is internal conflicts or legal problems....I seen a post that stated that SR is busy so there is no time to explain in the forums of that the community need not know until the higher powers feel it is the right time....<br /><br />THE FORUMS ARE PART OF SR COMMUNITY. they may be run separate but the voice of the people is here and here is were the explanations should be given. #1 rule about the drug use in my life was that if it didn&#039;t add up, make sense, of feel right then walk away.&nbsp; I have found a great spot here and it has blown my ind in more than one way.&nbsp; The mods or former mods helped me learn and grow which in turn helped me spend money on SR completing the financial reason that SR exists. Weather it is for a revolution or profit SR needs a good customer base,If these forums didn&#039;t exist there was no way I would of been able to complete a transaction on SR even with the knowledge,&nbsp; without the reassurance of reading about others success and failures there is no way I could of pulled the trigger on my first order.<br /><br />I have been instructed time and time again treat this place as if it is already compromised. I try but after reading posts like these I feel I must now take this more seriously. I do not think that SR is compromised but will treat it as such as a major event has occurred without reason or logic that I am aware of. For me to treat SR like it has been compromised means I can make no purchases here until I feel at ease ( normally I don&#039;t feel at ease until I have made purchases). I hope that proper information comes from the top on these matters so that I can start to build my trust again that the system is working so I can continue to purchase but for now I will sit with no BTC in my account and no plans to add any until I feel that this matter is explained to the community.<br /><br />I will watch and wait for awhile before moving past this part of my life I sure hope the explanations start to roll out but if they don&#039;t I would like to thank all the former mods and people that act like mods even without the title for making me a smarter person on security issues and making me apart of this community.I know that money is the main motivator for most Vendors but I must thank them for the vision of being brave enough to be part of this as well.&nbsp; Money might motivate but I feel that we all have a common interest.&nbsp; to make drugs more readily available to so we can obtain them in a safer environment than what we are use to. We all have secretly thought it would be cool if our drugs wouldn&#039;t be illegal and this site is like watching a cartoon in which anything is possible&nbsp; We have a community to examine each vendor and it is harder for these vendors to deceive clients with a community to gossip of each and ever sale if needed. there are still the constant influx of NOOBS here and we chastise them for there ignorance but we still try to help because we were all there once upon a time.&nbsp; If you asked a member about buying drugs online they would probably respond....&nbsp; dont get scammed buying BTC,&nbsp; the one thing that is actually legal is one of the biggest pitfalls. I will end my rant by wishing all the members of SR and even the LE reading the forums that Christmas time is upon us SO MERRY CHRISTMAS to one and all. For those that don&#039;t celebrate Christmas get on board and enjoy the season!

				Ok Guys not sure how to point this post to clear up everything fact of the matter I cant answer every question asked because the actual facts I&#039;m not sure of 100%. So those that know know the next part of my posting style and how I approach not only each member individually but he community as a whole and that&#039;s I&#039;m gonna call it like I see it and that&#039;s the best I can do and should be more than enough to calm a few conspiracies.<br />IDK how DPR wants me to explain the situation but he has always seen the fact that i&#039;m here for the revolution then rest is entertainment and replacing misinformation with true information the most important commodity in the community.<br /><br />So I&#039;ll start by saying I arrived back after my birthday in mid November I took two very much needed weeks vacation because this community is like family to me at this point highly dysfunctional but when challenged you see it&#039;s nature is to auto cruise in watching each others backs. I&#039;m very pleased with this as it&#039;s what I expect from you guys I&#039;ve tried to teach you guys that this is are strongest defense and the cure to all attempts against our freedom and the place we treat as home, we coming weekly and gossip, joke, defend and honor each other. All the while with enemies as close to us as we can almost eradicate them from our community with watchful eyes as we pass the days. I&#039;m truly honored to to have been given the chance of fate to get to know many of you quite well. Anyway now that I&#039;ve shared my&nbsp; happiness with the evolution of the community I&#039;ll get to the point of this thread topic. <br /><br />I arrived and noticed the server for the marketplace was down , well i&#039;d spoke with DPR before my vacation and got the impression a updates was to happen soon when I never know just like you guys but they always are the same. The server is disconnected&nbsp; randomly and never announced , well the veterans know that this happens exactly the same every time and an update occurs. They always have to&nbsp; calm the newer members down because the tinfoil becomes the most precious during these times and as usual no one listens to the vetran members na d the larger we grow the more screaming the sky is falling the less the veterans can be heard and the3 less they even attempt to talk reason. So that first day back with the marketplace disconnected and the forums pure madness with psyops and conspiracy. I knew exactly what i was gonna due...take a third week off. :P<br />&nbsp;So i spent the day musing over the newbs and tinfoil designs and hanging with the tightest group that IRC crew, we all had a good day it was fun and a lot easier to control the conspiracies and explain the situation. Also&nbsp; I noticed a new person in chat that i began casually sizing up he was speaking often about socio situations and how ppl react in these types of situations he and I realized we were both sizing up the situation and each other trying to figure out the other but not ever actually talking about it. After a few hours of this. He leaves chat and I decided to come post a few random threads and posts trying to calm those that knew I would direct them properly and level headed.After about 30 minutes I noticed previous posts I&#039;d made within the hour were deleted and removed. You guys will remember the trojan clearnet link hysteria. Well this is my honest observation. The mystery chatter was the link poster and starred as both the hero and antihero in the situation as a socio experiment on our own little community to see how everything went down, know if this was LE or a mere hack geek I do not know, I&#039;m guessing the latter. Put from the reaction the mere url gave inspired to further the experiment to an even larger scale and in my eyes to show the fact the forums are transparently unsecure, which personally I dont think it needs to be that secure we hold nothing of value except our communities essence and traits in helping to acclimate new members both vendors and customers. Any way it&#039;s my belief as I think Guru told someone I&#039;d shared it with him via encrypted PMs that the forum had a wild card behind the wheel having fun with the community created madness by fueling it more by first trying to remove my helpful information I was sharing.<br />Then I guess the fact that i could simply take the removed info from the recycle bin back to where i had it originally.I decided I&#039;m done with the weirdness and left for the week. When I returned Marketplace was up and running but the forums were still screwy. I saw I&#039;d been stripped of my mod features, but instantly knew it was not because I&#039;d done something but because I was doing exactly the right think and No SSR staff member demodded me but the pseudo socio engineer since i was the the one with the most overall experience and knowledge it was I suspected to be a continuum of the experiment&nbsp; but in a very sly almost invisible way a reaction from me of rashness and entertainment I was surely to provide lulz being removed of my dedicated and duly deserved respect for the tireless effort I take pride in doing what I can for our community but nomad was not to give this satisfaction and I went on business as usual just with no mod&nbsp; title or actual control. After a day or so of no reaction from me and few posts, I was no fun for him so i believe it was microRNA that was doing what i&#039;d usually be doing and Guru as well, they became the targets, not sure which was first but I had reported back to DPR about this intel I had observed. and he indicated that an investigation was being formed to look into it. I believe DPR thinks it was an inside job and I and outside job but none the less DPR had too remove all power left to investigate.<br />

				IDK if this is something that I should release openly but me being me am gonna saying it so that the house becomes transparent as possible at least from my side. Inside job i&#039;ll never buy. microRNA was a dream come true for me as far as, I couldnt have selected a better moderator myself as far as the same passion as me, for the community, in fact i was gonna suggest to DPR he be modded but before I could DPR had seen what I saw and what I believe DPR originally saw in me. Guru was doing an excellent job as well and was a god sent for me, because some of you know I was a 1 man forum moderator for nearly 5 months earlier this year and was on the edge of walking away because it&nbsp; is way too much for any single man to try to handle.&nbsp; I stayed because microRNA and Guru inspired me to stick around with their help I noticed my stress levels greatly decrease and renewal in trying to inspire you guys to work together around here because the day is coming when I have to walk away, sad but true.<br /><br />So 3 weeks later I&#039;d been contact with DPR trying to see if I could gain any intel and secret mods was the only thing I could gather.<br />So this is my point of view of the entire last month or so. For now I&#039;m here and I&#039;m back to business as usual. The only reason it took me so long to share this with the community is because i&#039;ve not been in the forum because I&#039;ve had strep throat and deathly ill. Had I known you guys were looking for some insight I&#039;d have dropped by and given my reveal.<br /><br />I want to take this bit of space to thank moksha for helping me with mod reports and the awesome job at spam busting. Rest assure your SR forum staff members are a dream team I&#039;ve wanted for nearly a year and they care very dearly for the community as do I and deserve equal respect. Now the current state of the community forum staff I dont have the details&nbsp; and It&#039;s my opinion it&#039;s this way as a security measure and each secret mod knows their job and they take care of business.<br /><br /><br />This is my account, is it 100% the fact of what occurred, in my mind yes, but I do not know anything that was discovered during investigation or if it is even possibly an ongoing thing.&nbsp; Everyone just continue with your daily as normal DPR is still DPR I am still nomad and Silk Road Is as diverse as ever. I do not think LE had anything to do with this situation and if they did they were way out of their league and over shadowed.<br />I feel this was a mere socio experiment to show those that live with there eyes wide shut that your safety is in your hands and yours alone so for your well being be safe, be smart and FE is never an option, customer is king do not be scammed as rats are still feeding.<br /><br /><br />Long Live Silk Road , It&#039;s Community and It&#039;s Revolution!!!<br /><br /><br />X)<br />nomad bloodbath

				Thanks nomad. That also makes sense of the claim about the hacker.<br /><br />When a post gets deleted, doesn&#039;t it tell you who deleted it?<br /><br />Also, what&#039;s a stealth moderator? Every account should have a UID, visible when you visit their profile. Every account should be accounted for.

				TY for clearing that ^ SelfSovereignty! btw, did anyone notice nomad bloodbath&#039;s posts? (Doesn&#039;t explain pine though) We both posted at same time, and I took all the attention. Maybe we should go back and read them again. I&#039;ll get off the forums so people can read them. Piece out people.

				I don&#039;t think she was a mod. She started that PGP Club and a couple other things. Not sure where she gained her education (was wearing a college mortar-board on her you tube vids) but she helped a lot of newbs on SR with security and not getting caught on Tor, frequently contributed on Security and Philosophy, Economic and Law sections. Sounded like she studied International Politics (use of terms and selection of knowledge). If SR was compromised (didn&#039;t say it was, didn&#039;t say it wasn&#039;t, didn&#039;t say anything), she&#039;d be the first one to pick up on it, and suggest how to solve it. She wrote a staggering amount of material on teaching us to think independently, and be aware of our environment; not to do stupid things. She&#039;s not the type to take a break or just up and go for no reason, so obviously a bit of a concern. Last logged over a month from memory. Don&#039;t know why but only the really bad things that usually happen to really good people are the only things that come to mind.

				never knew Pine was a Mod..<br />and i never thought LE would really want her[him]..<br />but who knows..<br /><br />but as Nomad said.. we cannot forget that people have real lives..<br />outside of this glorious community.. despite popular demand!<br />Pine could very well have been injured.. or perished. :(<br />we just do not know what is going on with anyone.<br />Pine could&#039;ve been LE the whole time, who knows??<br /><br />/thumbs

				I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll say it again nomad is one of the only person opinions and views I trust around here. I might not agree with everything he says but he&#039;s been nothing but a honest, transparent, mod/member.<br /><br />I never really thought anything too crazy was going on but with everyone disappearing I couldn&#039;t help but think something strange is happening, what? I don&#039;t know...I still can&#039;t really figure out why everyone is just deleting their accounts or just disappearing but I&#039;ve never made any wild accusations. It&#039;s kind of just the nature of the life style.<br /><br />I still find it strange that admins have been popping up with no posts and yes, I do realize this is probably just previous admins with new accounts but when you have all the mods disappearing and the down time, I feel we deserve some sort of explanation, that&#039;s all just something simple. I&#039;m aware DPR can&#039;t update us on every little thing that happens on here for obvious reasons but just a simple explanation would go a long way with stopping the tinfoil hat theories.
