				Canada(BC at least) has shitty liquor laws. Due to liquor taxes a $80 of Highland Park 18 year scotch costs over $150. What is more we cannot have anything over 50%, which means no everclear. Also, absinthe is limit to only certain types without certain ingredients.<br /><br />There may be some money to be made on this. I would buy a few liters of everclear just for mixing stuff.

				I could see selling everclear. It&#039;s illegal in half the states as well. Still, there isn&#039;t much demand and the profit margin would be slim. <br /><br />And to people saying alcohol shouldn&#039;t be sold here because &quot;it&#039;s too harmful&quot;, I can direct you to links for heroin, meth, and cyanide if you would like.

				I keep seeing people say there is cyanide on SR but I have never seen it....<br /><br />I can see underage people wanting alcohol, and like other things there could be a profit margin that makes it work.&nbsp; For instance, there is literally no vendors selling alcohol so the first person to do it would figure out the right price range.&nbsp; I would sell small bottles that I bought in bulk for large bottle prices if I was going to do it.&nbsp; It would either get bought and I would make money or I would have a stash of a drug I use that I could sit on and waste none of and actually save money.

The problem with alcohol is that it is considered normal to consume and therefore it is much more difficult to spot a person going the wrong way with it. It&#039;s also addictive whereas weed, acid, mdma, shrooms and dmt for example aren&#039;t. In my opinion alcohol should be placed up there with meth, crack and smack in terms of how dangerous it can be. In 15 years deaths caused by liver cirrhosis (the majority alcohol induced) will match that of heart disease in the UK apparently. It&#039;s everyone&#039;s personal choice at the end of the day but i think alcohol should only be used in hand soaps and preservatives to kill living cells (bacteria) instead of nearly every organ in the human body. If people want it on Silky then fair enough but i&#039;m not for it. What advantages does it provide? It gives a fake sort of confidence but i can&#039;t really see any other benefits. It relaxes people by making them more para-sympathetic but weed and other medicinal plants can do that far more effectively. Has anyone noticed that i&#039;m not a fan of alcohol?&nbsp; :D

				I&#039;m an aussie vendor considering selling 1.2L bottles of Johnnie Walker blue label scotch, the real deal in its original case, let&#039;s just say off the back of a truck;) They retail for over $1000 but I would list them for about $500-$600. I just need to confirm SR does not have a policy against selling goods advertised as stolen, as these bottles are. If any aussies are interested pm me so I know there is some interest. I would post unique pics for interested buyer&#039;s confidence. <br /><br />Also I used to buy 700ml bottles of homemade sambuca and vodka from a guy I used to work with for $15. It was 50% alc so it was a little strong at first, but it grows on you. I would think if someone was selling decent alcohol at those prices then there would be a place for it here. Maybe not in all parts of the world but some places have decent taxes on alcohol and if previous buyers were able to get back on SR to leave feedback then that is enough for me to know I won&#039;t go blind. Cheers, Boyd.

A lot of wine goes through the post because connoisseurs don&#039;t want to travel to their fave vineyard for their drop. Post shops sell boxes specifically to transport wine bottles. I would not be worried if the few underage kids who use SR buy alcohol, I&#039;m sure it is much easier even for them to get it in real life and if they do have access to SR then alcohol is not the worst thing they can get their hands on.

				I think it&#039;s a bad idea.&nbsp; Only teenagers are going to buy this.&nbsp; They are more likely to drink themselves into the ER, and then SR will be blamed.&nbsp; We don&#039;t need to be labeled as dealing drugs and booze to kids.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unless you could sell something rare for a good price, like European Absinthe or real Champagne.&nbsp; Then you might get some interest from 21 and up buyers.

				I have considered this, I first and foremost came to the road in search of some of the finest weed known to man... and in turn sampled some mighty fine products. I agree that most people probably cast a dim view on alcohol abuse i would doubt very much that an under 18 year old would be more likely to buy alcohol than weed? seriously??<br />Anyway i find this thread quite interesting, I get pretty much 100% pure scottish mullugrem which is illegal I think in britain. It really is amazing stuff and had some fantastic nights on it, normally assisted by a few spliffs.<br /><br />I really have fallen in love with the road, and i think it also has a fantastic community which makes it extremely unique.

				Okay we have heard from people concerned about kids buying alcohol from here. If you agree with these people there is no need to post your thoughts/ideas because they are already here. <br /><br />Some people however might like the idea, some vendors may even be subscribed to this thread to gauge interest. No need to derail this thread with nanny state ideas, there are a few limitations as to what we can sell here, but they are in place only for the greater good of this site.

				One of the greatest experiences of my life has come from a potion made of ----- marijuana, lsd, and absinthe&nbsp; -------.... all ingredients are on silk road except for the latter (absinthe) and i cant find it for the life of me. i would love to have the option of buying rare, discount, or outlaw types of alcohol, wouldnt everyone? im sure there would be great revenue in this.&nbsp; using SR to bypass govt alcohol taxes and laws would be using SR to its purpose!!! and it would be just like any of the other substances on here... alcohol is a drug like any other!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PLEASE VOTE EVERYONE!!!<br /><br />

				I used to distill some homemade corn liqueur(moonshine) and distribute it around my group of friends. It made great trading stock at music festivals. I&#039;d bet there would be a market for it. I thought it was strange when I first discovered SR that there was no alcohol being sold. Though 190 proof corn alcohol isn&#039;t for everybody, some people really seem to enjoy it! If SR starts allowing alcohol sales, I may have to vend some.

				I think there could be a niche market for specialty and rare alcohols so I would say, Yes.. Shipping is going to be high as the weight of these items are going to be much heavier than what most of us currently purchase.. Thats why I say specialty and rare, cus Im not going to pay you 5 bucks for a 6 pack of domestic beer when I have to also pay you 25 to ship it to me ya know.. This stuff about kids buying it blah blah, they are going to access SR and buy whatever they want, its not any worse for a child to access the site and buy a gram of heroin than it would be for them to buy a bottle of wine, so that point should just stop now.. Also I find it hard to believe that a child would waste time and money to go through all the trouble for a huge ass box of liquor to show up at the door when they could just get a tiny envelope with 100 tabs of 25i in it..<br /><br /><br />All that aside, I would love to see some rare and specialty alcohols available on SR..<br /><br />PS. I&#039;ve been to EU and have had Absinthe only once(tastes like black licorice pulled out of a cows ass!!) and its not as good or &quot;trippy&quot; as the media and movies make it out to be.. Its just alcohol, trust me!!

				In all seriousness, this could be beneficial in a number of ways. <br /><br />1. possibility of cheap prices depending on your location (different prices from different geographic areas)<br /><br />2. access to rare/outlaw alcohol that is not found in stores/your country<br /><br />3. more coinflow for the road<br /><br />4. larger product selection for us travelers<br /><br />5. beat taxes and tariffs<br /><br />6. generating more bitcoin for the&nbsp; digital currency<br /><br />7. spreading the joy of spirits<br /><br />8. who doesn&#039;t want to try absinthe? (make marijuana potion with it and have a green dragon) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />C&#039;mon everyone, doesn&#039;t alcohol just seem like it would naturally be an option on Silk Road anyway? <br /><br />Lets make it happen and strengthen out private/hidden/kickass economy!!!!<br /><br />VOTE NOW!!!!! <br /><br />

				I could get Absinthe (supposedly) in my hometown.&nbsp; I am not sure how good the quality is, or if anyone can get real absinthe anymore.&nbsp; I did some research about this a few months ago and I was dissapointed by what I read.&nbsp; If you could get some Absinthe that was definitely real and on par with what they had in the Victorian and Edwardian Era then I would gladly buy some.&nbsp; So long as the price is good I would probably buy some just to test it out, not being 100% sure it is &quot;real&quot;.&nbsp; I hate going to liquor stores personally, I have been maybe 10 times total in my entire&nbsp; life.&nbsp; I always feel dirty when I go for some reason.&nbsp; Probably because no matter what, even if I go to one in the most upscale trust fund baby neighborhoods like Hyannis Port, Plano, Boca Raton, or Dunwoody...

				A standard bottle of 12 y/o malt can go for anything around 18-30 gbp. You can get a blended scottish whisky which is cheaper, normally starting at 12-14 gbp.<br />I live in scotland and love my whiskey, i have quite a good collection. I also get what we call mullugrem, which is the raw whisky (clear) which i suppose is our moonshine. It is illegal and comes from some of the best known malters on islay. It really is an amzing drink and is extremely rare. normally the raw whiskey is sent to companies like johnny walker e.t.c to be blended in to a smoother (less powerfull) whisky.

Think it was a &#039;Vice&#039; program. They visited an african country ( Uganda maybe) and alcoholism was rife. A lot of people drank moonshine. Made from mashed bananas that were left to ferment for a month and the alcohol drained off. was very potent. the villagers got wasted everyday lol. but think their was dangers of blindness lol. Any villager could do this but they needed a license. Then their were big companies that used processed sugar i think. Cant rememeber the name of the drink. Definately moonshine though<br />:)

				Making moonshine or brandy is a piece of cake. Doesn&#039;t take too long and only requires a basic understanding of the foundations of chemistry (ie: distillation &amp; filtration). I don&#039;t drink alcohol at all because I hate the taste. Corn-based moonshine doesn&#039;t taste very good in my opinion, but it doesn&#039;t taste *bad* I guess. Banana brandy tastes delicious - and that&#039;s coming from someone who barfs after 3 beers.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t get is this - and this is aimed at the American posters... Why is everyone so worried about how expensive it would be to ship alcohol? The medium flat-rate Priority boxes could fit practically any bottle, and you don&#039;t exactly have to write &quot;THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS A BOTTLE OF ALCOHOL&quot; on the box.

				The only real problem I see with shipping is that if USPS discovers it is a liquid+glass container and was not labelled as such beforehand. Generally shouldn&#039;t be a problem anyway, but it&#039;s possible.<br /><br />One time, I saw Delta11 post THC wine listings quite a while ago, which of course went quickly and will likely never return since they lost their cannabis sorceress. FarmerBob has mentioned the possibility of selling THC liquor someday, which I&#039;d love to try.<br /><br />The only kind of alcohol I think I&#039;d want to procure would be Popcorn Sutton&#039;s legendary moonshine but I just found out he committed suicide a few years ago... damn Discovery Channel LIED TO ME!! lol. And I also just found out that there is already Popcorn Sutton&#039;s Tennessee White Whiskey being sold, using his recipe and techniques. So that&#039;s that.<br /><br />So bring on the THC likker and I&#039;ll be all over it!

I got to make more purchases on SR and resale for business until I can begin purchasing for personal use, tinctures and the like. Thanks. I would definitely be interested in just regular alcohol too though, if it could be offered in criminally low prices from a third world country or something. If it could be offered in bulk at prices which could be resaled.<br /><br />Something like 160 or 200 proof so it could be transported more easily and prepared properly once it&#039;s arrived. Preferably homemade in a distillery. Actually, this might be a good idea for me in the future, I know a few people who make their own 80-120 proof alcohol that could be sold on here.<br /><br />Of course anyone selling homemade alcohol has to be reviewed properly and have good status to be sure that what he makes is good ethanol and no methanol.

Most would have been created by probably a decent chemist but not under ideal conditions, you&#039;d be lucky to get above 85% purity except for a few substances (like meth, cause it&#039;s so easy to make from pseudo, which is pretty easy to extract at good purity without fancy lab equipment). I&#039;m sure if drug manufacturers spent more time on purification that would change, but why get rid of that 15% of crap when you can just sell it as part of a pretty decent product for bigger weight?<br /><br />Only real dangerous thing about moonshine is explosions from vapour during distillation, which isn&#039;t really of any concern by the time the product is being shipped.

				It seems like a bit of a waste of time for me anyway. Wouldn&#039;t this be an invitation to more underage users? Not that I have a problem with that really. I drank some home distilled booze a couple of times whilst I was in Vietnam and whatever was in it, made me and a few others go a bit loopy (not just from the alcohol). I did read also that the way that they distilled it, can cause you to go blind and a few people died. Considering the already ease of accessibility and on top, the shipping costs, I think this is just a white elephant.

If the first bit doesn&#039;t get thrown out, consumers of that batch are drinking methanol, which is HIGHLY toxic. If you think the possibility of explosion from mash vapors is the real danger, head on out to AutoZone or Walmart and pick yourself up a bottle or two of HEET (yellow bottle, blue lable, automotive section) and take a few swigs. HEET is what you&#039;re drinking if the first few liters aren&#039;t thrown out of a batch of &#039;shine.

If the first bit doesn&#039;t get thrown out, consumers of that batch are drinking methanol, which is HIGHLY toxic. If you think the possibility of explosion from mash vapors is the real danger, head on out to AutoZone or Walmart and pick yourself up a bottle or two of HEET (yellow bottle, blue lable, automotive section) and take a few swigs. HEET is what you&#039;re drinking if the first few liters aren&#039;t thrown out of a batch of &#039;shine.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you&#039;re a concerned buyer, it&#039;s easy enough to perform a chemical test to tell which one it is.

				The first &quot;bit&quot; of product doesn&#039;t have to be thrown away.&nbsp; Any proper reflux can pull the, drinkable,&nbsp; product in a single distillation.&nbsp; You just hold the right temperature in the distillation column until you stop getting methanol.&nbsp; Then you bump the temperature up.&nbsp; I mean... you might want to rid a little product to clear any methanol from the condenser.<br /><br />Pot still is a different story.

				I think it would be groovy to buy some absinthe with real wormwood content in the states. If it was at a decent price of course.

				I posted this in another thread awhile ago and think it would be a good way of doing alcohol on here<br /><br />I wouldnt mind an alcohol section as long as major brands arent allowed to be sold there. i would love to have a place to buy rare beers and liquor. The reason I say no major brands is too keep the 16 year olds from buying 3 30 racks of natty ice and a bottle of smirnoff then crashing mommys car. Keep it to singles or 6-12-24packs of micro beer or bottles of liquors that arent easily obtained in stores (absinthe, limited editions, aged liquors and wines, etc...). <br />Also maybe a homebrew section would be possible as well, would love to try some users creations!

				Absinthe does not get you high in a different way from alcohol.&nbsp; I have drank many different brands of absinthe from all over the world and have been present when absinthe was being distilled (drank it directly from the still).&nbsp; My buddy is a chemistry major and total absinthe nerd so we have sampled many from his collection.<br />The myth of Absinthe psychosis (or hallucinations etc) is a negative PR campaign invented by the french wine industry to steer the public away from absinthe and back to wine in the 1910s.&nbsp; Think of how zombie stories are used to demonize MDPV, interracial rape was used to demonize marijuana, etc.<br />Absinthe will give you a different drunk from other spirits, as will whiskey compared to gin or beer, etc, but it wont make you trip balls. But it is incredibly tasty liquor.<br /><br />The reason I want to be clear is because if an alcohol section opens up on SR, I plan to vend said buddy&#039;s homemade hooch and do not want to be swamped with 0/5 complaint bullshits like &quot;i didn&#039;t trip ballz i just got drunk&quot;.&nbsp; I may also offer a MXE dosed option to remedy this problem (a personal favorite combination of mine, in the right dosage)<br /><br />Do your research if you give a damn (clearnet): <br />http://www.wormwoodsociety.org<br />http://www.oxygenee.com/

				I think alcohol on SR would be bad and here&#039;s why. The majority of things here are already illegal and there is no established system of taxation and regulation for them. Alcohol is different. Here in the US, as well as many other countries from what I read, there are not just regulations in place but a very aggressive taxation system in place. If there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned about corrupt government, like in my country, money rules all. With the media coverage lately in different countries I feel like it&#039;s easy for the jackasses to speak up in the media about how bad SR is and stop giving a shit right after the camera is off.&nbsp; Why, because there&#039;s no money being lost. Not&nbsp; gained, but lost. When you&nbsp; introduce a product that is taxable and use SR a a way to dodge those taxes it won&#039;t take long for somebody to give a shit. Once that happens, bye-bye SR. <br />With the majority of what I&#039;ve read talking about selling and buying here to lower cost of said goods, mostly due to those taxes, I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be long before backlash will be felt. <br />Sure, that&#039;s just my doomsday scenario and the sales would likely have to be quite large before anyone takes notice. SR already has a bullseye on it and there&#039;s so much invested into SR right now that I&#039;d hate to see something like this be the straw that broke the green camel&#039;s back. <br />Unless the alcohol can be done in a way that it encourages the home brewers and discourages people trying to move product tax free I say hell no to alcohol.

				Thanks Krispy. Like I said, I also think it would have to be a large amount of sales before someone took notice. I&#039;m not totally against the idea. I think it just needs some standards and guidelines that will be hard to enforce, let alone establish. If it were to pop up on SR I would probably make a purchase or two myself of some exotic or rare liquor. I&#039;ve never been one to turn down a drink myself. <br />I&#039;ve been on SR about a year now and really love what&#039;s going on here. The legit vendors and community are a real testament to why the war on drugs is bullshit, but that&#039;s for another post.&nbsp; My point is that alcohol is one of those polarizing subjects, as evidenced by this thread. I just can&#039;t help but envision a scenario in which the alcohol becomes a thorn in the side, much like the guns were at one point. And NO, I&#039;m not comparing alcohol to guns. I&#039;m just saying that they are both polarizing subjects, guns much more than alcohol. <br />If the category can be setup and run so that people are selling 100 year old bottles of whiskey and micro-brews, not party balls of Miller and 30 packs of Keystone, then it would be worth thinking about. I&#039;m just not sure that is possible though. If it is possible I&#039;m sure the ideas put forth in this thread will help get it there.

				Home brewed beer would have been great to have on SR. My experience with big commercial beers is that they are made to reach as big as possible audience, thus making them quite tasteless. There are exceptions to this like Brewdog and many microbreweries, but those beers are quite expensive. When you make beers for developing your skill in the art of brewing you can experiment much more and make a much more exiting beer than what is made by most big breweries. <br /><br />So if you are passionate about your brew, honest about its taste I would expect you can make a name for your self here. I have some friends who are very engaged in brewing beers. They have had many very good beers, but to register as a brewery is to much work and to expensive for them to be worth while. So I&#039;m guessing there are many hidden treasures out there that would be cool to explore. <br /><br />And we&#039;ll get around the way to high taxes that are on alcohol around here&nbsp; :)

				First post on here, been lurking for a while :)<br /><br />I am curious as to what you guys mean by &#039;real champagne&#039;? I can&#039;t imagine it&#039;s hard to come by in the states? Where I live (Aus) it can&#039;t be called champagne unless it&#039;s from Champagne in France (I thought this was the case all over the world)? The champagne industry are famous for being real pricks about it<br /><br />Bollinger/Mumm/Veuve Cliquot/Cristal/Dom Perignon/Moet etc are just some of the &#039;real&#039; ones? Are they really that hard to source there (I&#039;ve never been to the states)?<br /><br />Also, to those talking about shipping grog/ciggies to Australia in order to beat high tax, it would want to be some sort of hell stealth method because any alcohol caught coming into the country will be subject to duties (very high, hence our ridiculous alcohol pricing here)

				Sorry if this was already pointed out, but a lot of vendors might not want to sell it because anything weighing over 13 oz needs to be mailed from a post office desk (in the US anyway).<br /><br />Other than that, I don&#039;t really see the harm in it.

				I support the move (recognizing certain limitations owing to profit margin) and am enjoying checking out Unwizard&#039;s absinthe listings right now, but I am somewhat concerned about an aspect that has been talked about at its edges but not fully addressed. Or maybe I&#039;ve missed something.<br /><br />Early on (maybe page four?), someone pointed out that alcohol does get mailed, and the post office is used to handling packages from vinyards, there is standardized packaging for bottles, etc.. All good. <br /><br />There&#039;s mention of the tax man and how zealous customs can be. This is true. But I&#039;m betting if LE got two hot tips, one about a cocaine shipment and another genuine Champagne, and could only stop one, they&#039;d happily ignore the bubbly. <br /><br />Thing is, what happens when you add these two issues toghether? Yes, bottles can be packaged safely - but obviously - and int&#039;l shipments of alcohol and tobacco need customs stamps or that shit gets confiscated right quick. The cocaine (etc) is at least disguised to be anything else. Your Johnny Walker blue label is still going to be, rather obviously, a bottle of alcohol (maybe not a problem for moonshine and other home brew depending on packaging; unsure). <br /><br />How do you deal with the mix of obvious product type and a zealous shipping/enforcement regime already in place? (listings of obviously stolen goods is an interesting issue on its own that I&#039;m curious about in a general way)

Obviously stealth and diversion are utilized to increase chances of successful delivery.<br />I think the vast majority of SR orders are simply not opened/inspected by customs, some that are pass inspection, while others do not. It&#039;s simply a game of numbers, and we are pretty much pwning the game...

				I just wanted to get this off my chest. If you look back in this thread you will see me commenting(rather strongly) against alcohol on SR. Mostly because of the financial implications brought on by dodging taxes and corrupt government. As I&#039;m writing this I&#039;m waiting on Absinthe from UnWizard. I guess that means I&#039;ve changed my opinion on this. Although I still stand by what I said earlier, read it if you care I&#039;m not re-posting it, I do see the reason for a category and am in support of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess at first I was too naive to see the real use of this category. With the influx of noobs, mostly kids, I imagined people hawking Jack, Crown, Goose, 30 packs and cases, something like an after hours club.&nbsp; Just trying to beat the man. I was wrong. There are plenty of alcohols that aren&#039;t readily available to certain parts of the world and this is an avenue for obtaining them. As I await my Absinthe I would like to thank you guys for opening my eyes to it&#039;s real purpose. I gotta admit,&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been known to turn down a drink and that moonshine sounds&nbsp; pretty nice. I might just be making my second alcohol order on SR.

				Thank you for your support ROBOTRIPPIN! I hope that someday the restrictions on herb and alcohol content of absinthe are lifted and that my products can find their way into the legitimate market, but until that day Silk Road seems like the best place to find customers for my fine organic potions. I am happy that the community has been so supportive this far and allowed up to carve out a little niche for alcohol amongst the endless boards of weed and powders!<br />

				I&#039;ve only read the first and last pages, so don&#039;t know exactly how this thread has developed, but the first on my list of alcohol products would be laudanum (bet its already been mentioned lol!), the old 90% opium tincture, popularized by Victorian drug culture.<br />Another one like that (Victorian I mean) is absinthe, which I KNOW has been mentioned. Does anyone know the theory, however, that the supposed narcotic/psychedelic qualities were, in fact, an invention of popular thought at the time and subsequently exaggerated by later generations, because of its illegality? And thujones have NO real psychoactive effect? And the theory goes that it was really a strong spirit, with a few added herbal ingredients, and only made illegal because of its demonization in the Western media, at the time.<br />When I found out about the above theory, I was disappointed, but it would still be worth a shot. I&#039;ll have to read through the rest of this thread to see if there are any other unusual alcoholic products about.
