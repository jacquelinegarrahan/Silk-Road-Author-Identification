				In my opinion of course, the best thing about Silk Road is the community we have going here, on the boards. In all of the other boards I have been on that have &quot;markets&quot;, there was hardly any communication between members. Only when there was a problem with an order, or someone was scamming, would you really see the community speak. <br /><br />SR on the other hand, we have a really nice community here. People talk about their experiences with the items we see on the market. People talk about anything, really. The boards are quite active. <br /><br />So aside from being the eBay of illicit substances, Silk Road brings the consumers together into a nice community. That&#039;s hard to beat.<br /><br />what do you guys think?

				<br />Silk road is what made everything good when America was invaded by Europeans in 1492.&nbsp; &nbsp;Low Taxes, no permits, market decides if vendor/products stays or goes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lots of Land Enforcers trying to scalp us.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lots of THC Hemp to keep our sails tough, and our pipes packed. Back then it was all called hemp and im sure they prefered more euphoric varieties than today&#039;s definition of&nbsp; 000.014% THC Hemp.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like washington&#039;s Cherry tree and other BoldFaced lies we americans have to swallow.<br /><br />There are idiots out there that want taxes on Marijuana.&nbsp; They already pay taxes on electricity, water, land, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; I find it pathetic to tax marijuana.&nbsp; &nbsp;All these stupid white collar marijuana operators and their medical monopolies.&nbsp; It is so disgusting.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I watch shows like&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;American Weed, and Weed Wars.&nbsp; Most people are cheering on the dispensary people.&nbsp; Not me I pick on those douche-bags every chance I get.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ill go post in the off topic room.&nbsp; Cause I think others might share my view on these things.<br />Edit:<br />Here is my Anti Medical Marijuana monopoly off topic thread.&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19373.0&nbsp; I diss on the Dispensary shows a lot.

				Gotta agree, the community here really can&#039;t be beat.&nbsp; A scammer comes along every once in a while but is quickly ousted.&nbsp; Everyone here is just great, really.&nbsp; <br />Also have to agree with Dave on medical marijuana monopolies.&nbsp; The only dispensaries I was willing to go to were coops as they always had great shit, and actually cared about what they were doing, not just trying to make a buck.

				I agree wholeheartedly. We have a great community. I think that&#039;s to be expected, though. Everyone here shares an interest in the same groups of substances, a higher-than-average knowledge of informatics and a willingness to think outside the box and go after what we want (or we&#039;d never even have found the place). And then there&#039;s the inevitable feeling of brotherhood that arises from being on the same side of this huge &quot;us versus them&quot; issue where &quot;them&quot; is pretty much every single government on the face of the planet.<br /><br />We&#039;re a tight community, and I love it.

				Around where I live, if I asked someone for a few bucks to get something shipped that was important to me, I&#039;d get laughed at. On here though, I can simply say I don&#039;t have enough for shipping and someone, who I don&#039;t even know, steps up and offers me funds. We help each other so much here. I fucking love it. If the rest of the world could chill the fuck out, step the fuck back, and take a good long look at the SR, I think they&#039;d realize that communities like this one need to be seen on a regular basis. I shouldn&#039;t have to go on an underground website just to be treated like a human. <br /><br />The Community. The people. The love. The generosity. If you can&#039;t afford shipping, ask the vendor if he can loan you the shipping cost. Try doing THAT with ebay or amazon.<br /><br />DPR, and everyone else who keeps this site up and running, you are amazing human beings (who may or may not make a lot of money) ;) And I thank you for this.&nbsp;

				Well it&#039;s definitely the fact that a place like this even exists, and the people here. If we didn&#039;t have such an amazing team of admins, vendors, buyers, and all that, none of this would work. It&#039;s a testament to human greatness that we can get together and share our love for things that are very misunderstood.

				I think the best thing about SR is the future possibilities it holds. It will only get bigger and bigger, and unless it gets shut down it won&#039;t stop growing. I think in a couple years time providing everything goes well there will be 10-20 million silk road users at least. I think people like tony76 are gonna start having to hire staff eventually. And the best thing about silk road truly being a massive global market is that it means the end to scumbag street dealers with shitty product and underweight draws, and the start of a world where if you want it, you can have it.

				The best thing about SR is it&#039;s going to give me a way to shroom a fuck ton of people (at a profit no less) without exposing myself to a SWAT team cause someone local ran their damn mouth and gave away the plot.<br /><br />&nbsp;AND I get to play all Danger Mouse in the process.. with whizbang technology and e-currency and shit.

				The best thing about SR is the overall maturity of our community. When I deal IRL I sometimes encounter bullshit accusation on quality. Here, if there are no reasonable arguments to the accusation it doesn&#039;t matter. IRL arguments don&#039;t matter (when it comes to drugs [or maybe money]).
