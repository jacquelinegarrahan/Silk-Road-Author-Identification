				I started out with 6 eBooks which I actually had interest in, these are low prices of course (under $10 for all 6). After these I jumped to $100 in 25i-NBOMe tabs from Tyl3r Durden which shipped today. If you have any doubt, do plenty of digging on the Vendor/Product to determine whether or not you feel comfortable with it shipping to your location.

				I had to look back (for the price) but it was about 90 bucks for a quarter of Sour D from a relatively new vendor (only had been around 2-3 weeks). It was also the most troublesome order I&#039;ve had, interestingly (or not) enough. My address was apparently incorrect (he had handwritten it) and the package was sent back. He reshipped the order with a bit extra (apologizing profusely) and even offered to resend the original package, if he made it back to him safely. Nothing ever came of that (very sadly) but the product was quite good and the one I bought after that was even better :-). About 10 days though from order to finally having it in my hands...a record so far on SR: most of my orders take 2-4 days, 5 at the most.

				Not so good.&nbsp; Bought a little over $100 in oxy as a test case on a Sunday, said it was shipped Tuesday and now it&#039;s been a week with nothing received yet.<br /><br />Was going to get about $500 in coke but going to hold off to see if I ever get anything from the test shipment first.

				$1900 on my first buy - and this was when vendors were allowed to sell Out Of Escrow, and this vendor required upfront payment for international sales! I pretty much nearly shit myself when I sent the money to the vendor&#039;s account, but I&#039;d been lurking on the forums for a couple of weeks and had done all the research I possibly could. I was prepared to lose the money, but I made twice as much in profit as I spent on the order so the risk : reward ratio was well worth it for me.<br /><br />Vendor still hasn&#039;t let me down once, though we use the escrow system and I never FE on any sales these days. Just in case.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
