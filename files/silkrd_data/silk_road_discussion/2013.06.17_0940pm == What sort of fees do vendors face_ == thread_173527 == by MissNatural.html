				I&#039;m hoping to become a vendor in the near future, and I can&#039;t find anywhere the sort of fees that vendors face.... From what I am aware of, there is a fee for using hedged escrow... but is that it? If so, what is this fee exactly? What other fees do vendors have to face?

				10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /><br />You can make your customers pay the SR tax &gt;&nbsp; pre-commission pricing in settings.<br /><br />Schizofreen

				Is this if I use hedged escrow...? Or for any transaction?<br /><br />How would calculate if I wanted to sell an item for $280? Hedged, or Unhedged...

				If you&#039;re selling on SR then they tax all transactions, same as Ebay or any other listing service really. Hedged/unhedged wont affect the % fee. You could list it at $280 then add the tax on top or list it at $298 then deduct the tax from it.

				That&#039;s not what I&#039;m asking. I don&#039;t understand how those numbers up there are layed out....<br /><br />Is the Tax determined strictly based on the listing price? Or is the tax determined based on the total amount of all your transactions - this I ask because of the wording &quot;10% of the first $50&quot;, makes it sound like the more you sell the less your tax goes down, on a long-term basis. Yes, No?

				So everything under $50 has a 10% tax, everything between 150-300 has a 6% tax, etc? Just like that?<br />

It&#039;s cumulative. <br /><br />SR fees:<br />10% of first $50 (max $5)<br /><br />8.5% of $50 - 150 ($5 + max addl $8.5)<br /><br />6% of $150 - 300 ($13.5 + max addl $9)<br /><br />3% of $300 - 500 ($22.5 + max addl $6)<br /><br />2% of $500 - 1000 ($28.5+ max addl $10)<br /><br />1.5% for everything over $1000 ($38.5 + 1.5% amt &gt;$1000)<br /><br /><br />Hedging is on top of all that since it is based on the order total. If your profit margin is wide enough, you needn&#039;t use hedging. <br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />♔ Sir Pillsalot<br /><br /><br /><br />●ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ●<br /><br />The Gentleman Lords of Pharmaceuticals.<br />Serving US Patrons from within the US.<br />Serving UK Patrons from within the UK.<br /><br />●ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ●<br />

				Their is also the vendor bond, which I believe is something like $500 that you get back<br /><br />Plus shipping materials, and if your paranoid like me, the cost of gas to travel across the border or across provincial lines to purchase them.<br /><br />Being a safe vendor costs a lot more then one would think. I mean you can always cut corners and save a lot of money, but do you really want to jeopardize customer safety?&nbsp;
