				for months i was just dreaming that there could be a site where ppl could buy from a catalog of options, straight up no bullshit..where sellers were concerned with their reputation, rather than ripping folks off, and where the seller could judge the buyer on the fact that they always have their money right, dont be askin for 10 bucks off, dont be tryin to trade some stolen shit......then i&nbsp; saw on twitter someone referring to a silk road article and i read it and thought NO WAY!!! so i researched it, downloaded tor bundle, and bam i was cookin! i read the&nbsp; forums carefully as i could and finally bought some bitcoins at cvs, with no problem,&nbsp; and i was a buyer....UNBELIEVABLE..so freakin cool!!!!!!!&nbsp;

				Total happenstance. I was researching &quot;street price&quot; on Google for certain Rx&#039;s I have available, stayed up all night reading BS superficial websites.&nbsp; At some point and some link, (couldn&#039;t tell u where I found it) I came across a post regarding an apparent seller on SR. The post reply was simply stating that &quot;seller&quot; was verified on SR and therefore could be trusted.&nbsp; Continued research, downloaded Tor, found SR and BMR (only found BMR in a thread response to some dude attempting to sell w/o proper seller account credentials, lol).<br /><br />At any rate, I have been looking for sites like this for some time.

				When I look back, I find it funny that I actually used TOR for a brief time years ago but decided not to continue using it because of how slow it was. Still to this day, I honestly don&#039;t know how I came to discover this website. I think I read something about the &quot;deep web&quot; one night when I was stoned that eventually led me to this site. Prior to using this site, I never heard anything about it. I listen to NPR and go on their website frequently, but I never knew they had a report on SR.<br /><br />On a different note, thanks to SR, I take my online privacy much more seriously.

				i&#039;d played around with tor in the past purely out of interest in cryptoanarchy, but the main thing i heard it about it being used for back then was kiddie porn which turned me off to the whole idea, no pun intended.&nbsp; My brother had also mentioned something about SR probably near its beginning as he was quite active on some grower&#039;s forums and usenet groups. But it took an amature-ish journalistic attempt on gizmodo/lifehacker to pique my interest enough to keep reading around about it.&nbsp; I think in the end it was gwern&#039;s piece on it that made my mind up.&nbsp; He has some pretty provocative and compelling opinions.&nbsp; www.gwern.net<br /><br />Although I suppose dropping out of the scene for about 5 years and losing all my connections but finally wanting a little somfin somfin had the most to do with it.<br /><br />***LONG LIVE THE SILK ROAD***<br /><br />

				I first found out about Silk Road somehow, I can&#039;t remember. <br />I always have paper by my computer to write things down to then look up later. I was going through my papers and found &quot;Silk Road&quot; written on it. I am not sure if it meant this marketplace or the original silk road.. I probably wrote it about a&nbsp; year ago or more? <br />I also was on Topix reading something about how to get meds (benzos specifically, I have panic attacks) easily, how to find a doctor that will prescribe or find one online or something. Someone posted, &quot;just use silk road,&quot; or something.. I feel like he shouldn&#039;t have mentioned it though.<br /><br />Anyway, I really can&#039;t remember if I found the piece of paper first or read the Topix thing, they were very close together.. About 1-2 months ago.<br />Silk Road in an amazing place.
