				I&#039;ll let LAD post his own public key. What I will say though is that while SR was up, I grabbed his public key and the signed message above validates with it (i.e. this checks out with SR based information and isn&#039;t someone posing here as LAD to take advantage of the SR outage).<br /><br />That said... someone needs to review packaging and coke from him ASAP!

Have you tried any of the other tweak vendors, I&#039;ve tried a bunch and and for the most part they are all&nbsp; good one&#039;s. It&#039;s unfortunate that this one vendor, let&#039;s call him Mister Nice Guy, skipped on a bunch of members recently. That boy had some good shit. I still miss him and if he showed up today and squared everybody that he ripped off, I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to order my ball from him again. It cooked that good. Hell, I&#039;d buy a ball from him even if he didn&#039;t square up.&nbsp; Personally I just like trying the new guy&#039;s that come on to see what&#039;s up with their shit. If it&#039;s good they get a 5 of 5, If it&#039;s bad they still get a 5 for just delivering and then I move on to the next guy. That&#039;s the nature of the business. If LAD wants to do business, then come on. And if not I wish he would state that and SR would release the temporary block on the CANCEL button on my ball order with LAD. I can understand SR&#039;s point on that. I would never begrudge a vendor the chance to catch up on his orders but when you got a vendor that&#039;s lurking around and not a peep out of him, that gets my mind going in a crazy direction and am thinking this may be a blessing in disguise. Now I don&#039;t know if the vendor&#039;s cancel button also has that temporary block but if it doesn&#039;t,. LIKEANGELDUST either put it in transit or hit the cancel button and release my coin. I&#039;m from the old school of bikers, my word is my handshake and I think any of the 25 vendors I&#039;ve dealt with would back me up on that. When a vendor start&#039;s a thread like this one and a profile statement&nbsp; like this:<br /><br />likeangeldust profile statement:<br /><br />I only deal in the highest quality.<br /><br />I know my product &amp; hear feedback from the streets as well.<br /><br />My shipping method works and hasnt fucked me yet, so thanks but no thanks for the sugestions.<br /><br />On business days early in the AM we can get an order out sometimes same day. You can count on 2-3 days however max.<br /><br />Your concerns are our concerns. Something not right, something skewed??? Stop using the product &amp; immediately call us &amp; we will work it out. We need to know though, because as GI Joe says: Knowing is half the battle.<br /><br />ranked #147 out of 214 sellers with 100% positive feedback from 3 transactions<br /><br />rating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feedback&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freshness<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast, good quality, thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 days<br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast, no problems&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 days<br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;badass great seller&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 days<br /><br />and can&#039;t back it up, then you need to change your profile. Or at least update your profile with something. By the way if any one of these 3 customers is lurking around and can testify even though all 3 didn&#039;t purchase any coke, then I will be the first to put a disclaimer in.<br />Again, My Oct. 18th order is still in processing and if you ship, ship. Then post something somewhere, hear or there or let my coins go or SR let me cancel.I know your reading this shit L A D.............................. Hell, I&#039;ve done talked myself out of this deal already...&nbsp; LMFAO&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let my coins go SR and I&#039;ll purvey my yay elsewhere. I got things to do.<br /><br />Bikerbum

My crazy brain has rolled through that also. If he&#039;s a flake, he&#039;s a flake, no sweat off my balls, there&#039;s always the next guy. I&#039;ll give any vendor&nbsp; that has even zero feedback a shot as at least one other yay vendor on SR can remember. He&#039;s doing very well now. No need to go into any ID&#039;s, unless the vendor that remembers wants to disclose that. That&#039;s not the point anyway. The point is if you want to sell, sell. If you want to phish, knock your socks off as far as I&#039;m concerned. Nothing new in this business. They won&#039;t get no where with my ID. Now other members that don&#039;t have an extremely secure drop as I do should avoid this guy until he get&#039;s some reputable members to vouch for him. Hell I could have posted those 3 feedbacks for him. I digress, I&#039;m done with LADDYBOY. As soon as SR lifts the cancel button I&#039;m out and will be waiting for the next guy. At least my other orders for various sundries are in the pipeline. So thanks for your input Jack and we&#039;ll see how LADDY does, he either has to shit or get off the pot.<br /><br />Bikerbum

				The last time I was able to purchase was from Time Traveler. It arrived and was as expected, if it took an unusually (for anyone but TT) long time to arrive. <br />He doesn&#039;t ship when he marks it shipped. In my case, he shipped it about 12 days later, and it took 2 days to get to me. I had already given up hope on it. <br />I don&#039;t get the scam that LAD could be pulling. I mean... the money&#039;s in escrow, so where would it go? I think it more likely that he had intention of doing business on SR, but then abandoned the idea with the long outage and hasn&#039;t come back to attend to his orders. <br />But then... he was online on SR today. I&#039;ve emailed him multiple times with no response.<br />The BTC remain in escrow. <br />Here&#039;s a theory: Perhaps he sold out IRL while SR was down, and now we&#039;re waiting for him to top up so that he can process the online orders he didn&#039;t have access to for that week.<br />WHICH I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.<br />I just wish he&#039;d tell me something -_-<br />*shardplease*

				I also think it&#039;s worth pointing out that when I purchased (the day before the outage), the price/g was 93.69 from LAD, shipped. Now the price is 157.28.
