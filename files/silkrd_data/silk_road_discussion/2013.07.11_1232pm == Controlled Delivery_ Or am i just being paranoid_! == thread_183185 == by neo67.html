				Hi,<br /><br />I got a knock at the door with a man from a delivery company saying he had a package for this address but he needs a package in return.<br /><br />Didnt know what he was on about and neither did my brother, anyway i gave him my first name (stupidly) and he went on his way,saying i will get a call later.<br /><br />Am i just being super paranoid or was this an attempted controlled delivery,trying to get my full name,seeing who i was or something.<br /><br />(Another, more logical explanation, is that ive just moved house and the guys here before sent something to their old address by mistake)<br /><br />Any ideas......sorry if i&#039;m being too fucking paranoid....but better being safe than sorry hey?!

				Sure as Hell doesn&#039;t sound like any controlled delivery I&#039;ve ever heard of... but I have no idea wtf else it was about either.&nbsp; Seriously though, I wouldn&#039;t be too worried about it.&nbsp; No clue what he meant by he needs a package in return though.<br /><br />Sounds like somebody wanted to return a purchase to the company, and that&#039;s what he wanted?&nbsp; I dunno.

				What was said above sounds right. Someone was shipped an item as a replacement and the delivery guy is supposed to pick up a box with the defective item and return it. I had to do that when the LNB&#039;s on my satellite dish burned out. I packed them up and printed their shipping label and when the guy brought the new ones he took the old ones.

				I&#039;d only be worried if it was a large amount of drugs. They just take the small stuff.
