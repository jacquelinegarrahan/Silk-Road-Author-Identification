				Is it just me or has something happened to silk road while I&#039;ve been gone? I&#039;ve been off here for a while so don&#039;t criticize me in case I missed something, but the number of LSD sellers and the quantities available seem to have respectively disappeared... And the 25i-nbome has somewhat taken it&#039;s place, am I incorrect? Or does it just fluctuate like this every so often? <br /><br />Any psychonauts feel free to chime in, thanks.

				&nbsp;I was through with acid years ago, the last time someone gave me something claiming it was acid was in 2000, and it ended up being PCP. I found out later that most of the stuff going around that people were claiming was acid was not. <br /><br />Having experienced PCP and only finding out later that it wasn&#039;t acid, it wasn&#039;t worth it to me to gamble, because even if it was acid that doesn&#039;t mean that it was good acid.<br /><br />So I&#039;m not surprised that people are selling other things claiming it was acid, like DOC.

				Think about all the risk vendors are taking with federal charges and a whole lot of mess theyll be getting into if they get caught, pretty serious jail time. I think that is why L is so high, but i mean just cut them some slack they take high risk were they can be put away for half there life times. Some people got the hook therefore they can offer great prices. But shit changed people! After pickards bust shit went really south with the legit prices. So cut them a bit of slack. Risks are high. Even if your super discreet you never know what the leo/goverment has up there sleeves, so be careful. And dont trip so much on prices, put ur self in there shoes for a day. Just saying nothing personal
