				A lil confused by what you&#039;re asking... you just go to the location, in this case Walmart, either fill out some form or use that red phone to do it over the phone, and then pay at the register. It&#039;s all set after that. You&#039;ll get a confirmation email, within an hour you&#039;ll receive the btc.

				Do you have a bitcoin wallet?&nbsp; If not, get one.&nbsp; <br /><br />Open it, copy and paste your bitcoin address to give to whoever you&#039;re buying bitcoins from.&nbsp; They can&#039;t just send bitcoins to an email address - they have to have a bitcoin address.<br /><br />Note that you will have to wait a good while (several hours perhaps) for the block-chain counter thingie to catch up, before your bitcoins will arrive in your wallet.&nbsp; Sorry, I don&#039;t really know all the techno-speak. And I&#039;m not positive that all bitcoin wallets work this way, but mine did.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, your bitcoin wallet will have a feature for sending bitcoins to another address.&nbsp; Get your Silk Road bitcoin address (from your account page), copy and paste it into the &quot;Send to&quot; box in your bitcoin wallet, and hit &quot;Send.&quot;&nbsp; The bitcoins will show up in your Silk Road account a while later.&nbsp; Be patient.<br /><br />

				Of course, you could just give your bitcoin seller your Silk Road bitcoin address, bypassing the outside wallet route.&nbsp; But this is considered less secure.
