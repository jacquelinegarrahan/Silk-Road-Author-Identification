				Hi,<br /><br />I have seen some strange trends, hopefully as a newbie, you can help me out. I have been on here a month, and I noticed that the cannabis went from over 900+ listings to 349 in a matter of days. Then the prescription went from 900+ to 433. There also was a HUGE decrease of digital books missing. Is it because we have no many new members, or is it because people are taking down listings? Curious if anyone knows what is going on.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Jwill

				i have not noticed a significant change. <br /><br />i would guess you checked the box so only domestic listings show<br /><br />or changed your home country in the settings?

				Thank you!&nbsp; You know I did exactly those two things, I went from being &quot;undeclared&quot; to my shipping country, and then also had domestic checked.&nbsp; Whew..&nbsp; Thank you Modest Mouse.

				I was wondering the same thing myself. It didn&#039;t dawn on me that the selection box would be global. Cool.
