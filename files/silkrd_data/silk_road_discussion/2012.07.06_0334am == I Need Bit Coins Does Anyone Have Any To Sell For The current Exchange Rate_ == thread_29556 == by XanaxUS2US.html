For newer users why not head over to SR and buy yourself a few digital books or even a few porno vids from various users? They cost very little but help bolster your rep.<br /><br />As for obtaining Bitcoins, if you&#039;re based in the UK/EU I&#039;d be happy to sell you them for cash in the mail (one of the few safe ways to obtain Bitcoins), if you&#039;re based in the US I suggest you look up BlueSkyTraders who will be able to sell you them for Moneypaks. Message them for more details.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
