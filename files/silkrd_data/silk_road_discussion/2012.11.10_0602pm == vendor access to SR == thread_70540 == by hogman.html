				There&#039;s a good long-term plan for maintaining one&#039;s freedom. Let anybody who pays you $150 for a vendor account have your cell number :)<br /><br />No man... if anybody&#039;s got that, they sure aren&#039;t gonna share it.

				If there was a phone number, law enforcement would buy a vendor account, trace the phone number, look for all the connections to the Tor network in the area and arrest the management. It would be one of the easiest big-time busts ever.<br /><br />I don&#039;t expect there is any other connection between sellers and the site operators. But if there is, it definitely isn&#039;t a phone number.
