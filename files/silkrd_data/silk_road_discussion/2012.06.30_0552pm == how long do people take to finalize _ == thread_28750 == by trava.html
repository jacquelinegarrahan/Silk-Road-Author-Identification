				As soon as i receive it, I inspect the packaging real quick more to check if its been tampered then judging the vendor. Then I weigh it, reagent test it, and then i go to my computer and finalize and leave good feedback.<br /><br />All of that takes like an hour or two at most. <br /><br />There has been an occasion where I forgot to finalize after receiving, but I finalized the next day. <br /><br />That&#039;s pretty shitty of someone to receive an order and not finalize ASAP

				I finalize on receipt of the package. I then adjust my feedback after i have opened it up and weighed and tried the product.<br />I guess this method means it is possible i would finalize an empty package but i kind of assume most vendors would just not send the package if they were going to scam.

				I finalize as soon as product arrives, as im buying pretty much the same stuff from the same people i know how good the quality is and what to expect. The only trouble is when i come to wright feedback, i like to do an in-depth review about product, best way to use and effects ect, this can be a little repetitive after the 5 or 6 time and i tend to wander off topic a little, still i think its better than &quot;FE will update later&quot;, and then don&#039;t.

DCN shows they were delivered so they have the item. It appears to be somewhat common (20%-25% of the sales so far). More so with new buyers. When you look at a buyers account you can see there auto-finalization rate. I think if they let it auto-finalize it drops there overall rating.<br /><br />Total transactions: X<br />Total spent: à¸¿X<br />Refund rate: X%<br />Auto-finalize rate: X%<br />Member for: X months<br /><br />So it happens, just relax and wait it will release it eventually.<br />

				Oh wow don&#039;t get me started. BUYERS! Do your Vendor a Favor and Finalize when you get your order. I don&#039;t mind waiting 12 to 18 hours so they can get the package and try it out, but after a day or two it gets annoying as HELL! <br /><br />I do my part and get my item out there asap, so Buyers please do your part and finalize for me on point - for those that do. I solute you!

				I finalize as soon as the package arrives and I have had a chance to open it up to quickly inspect the contents. I strongly and firmly believe that at this point the vendor has lived up to their end of our agreement and deserves to be paid for their efforts. I leave temporary feedback rating the packaging, shipping time, and appearance at that time. After I have had a chance to inspect it more closely, weigh it out, and give it a try I then update the feedback accordingly. Sometimes the updated feedback takes weeks because I don&#039;t always immediately try the product.<br /><br />In my experiences the vendors here are very honest, open to feedback, and are all-around good people. I have found that the times where there has been problems, effective communication has always been the key to coming up with a good resolution. I have said this many times but the only thing that ***I*** can offer a vendor is honesty. I remember one specific incident where I ordered some low-grade weed from a respected vendor but when it arrived I found that it was his extremely expensive top shelf stuff. It would have been so easy to not say anything and be happy at my good fortune. However, before I even cut into the vacuum seal I PM&#039;d the vendor and let him know of the mistake and offered to compensate with the additional bitcoins so that everything was square. It turned out that it wasn&#039;t a mistake - he intentionally sent me the high grade stuff because he ran out of what I ordered and didn&#039;t want to leave me high and dry. You can well imagine that I have a very good business relationship with this particular vendor now and we both know where each other stands in terms of honesty and integrity. <br /><br />Being prompt with payment, not being a dick, and maintaining 100% accountability for your end of the Silk Road social contract will really go a long ways here.
