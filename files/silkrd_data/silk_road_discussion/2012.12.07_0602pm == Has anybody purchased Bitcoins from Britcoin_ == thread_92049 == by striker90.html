				Greetings guys, I&#039;m new.<br /><br />Looking to purchase BTC for the first time, and I am more paranoid about purchasing them than I am regular products on SR.<br /><br />Has anybody used Britcoins?&nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9aedd2d575<br /><br />Trading at in at £8 a coin, which is reasonable but I&#039;m being held back by their lack of feedback.&nbsp; On using the search on this forum, I noticed posts relating to Britcoin from just over a year ago.&nbsp; Which either means that this is the same person, or a scammer.<br /><br />Has anybody dealt with this guy?&nbsp; Options for getting BTC&#039;s while in the UK are seeming quite limited.

The seller on Silk Road simply shares the same name as Interango&#039;s previous trading name.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				i should have picked my words more carefully.&nbsp; <br /><br />however, if the account is under that name, but isn&#039;t the same people.&nbsp; then it could easily be a scammer using their name, no?&nbsp; it&#039;s also a new vendor account that&#039;s been active around a week.
