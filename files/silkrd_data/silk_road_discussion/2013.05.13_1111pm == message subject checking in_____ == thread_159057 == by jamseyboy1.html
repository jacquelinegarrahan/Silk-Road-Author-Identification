				Received a message from SR staff saying:<br />One or more of your shipments have not been confirmed in over 10 days . Please finalize any shipments that have arrived, or click &quot;resolve&quot; next to the ones that have not arrived. If you do nothing, your payment will be released to your vendor 17 days after your order was shipped.<br /><br />Is this just a heads up on saying i only have a few days or should i be a bit more concerned. Don&#039;t want to really bug the seller till maybe a week or 5 days left to auto finalize.

				It&#039;s nothing to worry about, it&#039;s just a message to either remind you to finalize, or if the auto finalize date is near to extend the time.

This will put the order into resolution. Read all of the instructions in the Resolution Center, and try to come to an agreeable resolution with your vendor.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Placing your order into resolution early avoids a whole host of issues, among them the issue of a vendor expecting their payment on day 17 or before, only to find out at the last minute that the buyer has put the order into resolution so they will have to wait at least 5 days more.<br /><br />Another reason to put the order into resolution after day 10 instead of at the last minute is in case there are site connectivity issues - if that were to happen, you risk having your order auto-finalise which would negatively impact your stats.<br /><br />In any event, clicking the resolution button automatically extends the order time by 5 days and you can still finalise the order at any time by clicking &#039;finalise&#039; - once you have received it, of course.<br /><br />You can read more about the ordering process (including the resolution center process) here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=The_ordering_process<br /><br />Libertas
