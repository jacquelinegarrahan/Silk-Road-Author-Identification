				I came across the &#039;Gary Glitter&#039; pills sold by JesusOfRave and went all nostalgic over the fact they are made by the same people who made &#039;Snowballs&#039;. &#039;Snowballs&#039; were the first ever pill I tried and they were so fucking good. Not too harsh and pure empathy. You just felt love from the moment you come up.&nbsp; I was going to dive in and buy 5 but I noticed they are almost £6 a pill! Now some people are cool with that but before I moved many moons ago I was picking up &#039;Snowballs&#039; for £50 per 100 so I can&#039;t understand the pricing here. I&#039;m not knocking JesusOfRave at all, his prices are pretty much in line with everyone elses here and he is a top vendor who has sold me A grade hash, I was just using him as an example because I really want those pills but I can&#039;t pay that much for them knowing I used to get similar ones so cheap. Anyway, is there some great pill drought around the world or something because these prices need to drop. I can justify paying £100 for a banging gram of coke because if it&#039;s that good you&#039;re only sniffing ~25mg a time but £6 for 1 pill? Come on...

				Damn dude, if you think the prices are reasonable I feel for you. 50p a pill for a hundred was standard rate when I was in the city. Only on bulk though, singles were £2.50. Supply and demand might be right, especially since most people now prefer their MDMA in crystals. <br /><br />Fuck it, I&#039;m going to take the plunge and get some &#039;Gary Glitter&#039; pills anyway, the nostalgia is too strong : )

				I always wondered the same thing.<br /><br />But think about this:<br /><br />1. Dealers dont have time to sit there and measure out 100-200mg of MDMA and cap em.<br />They buy em pre pressed with no mess. Big D boys get pills by 100&#039;s or 1000&#039;s at a time. Plus they believe in all that &quot;Stamp&quot; and ( the BS&gt; Triple Stack expression&gt;which is just a Expression used to fool people in to hype) <br /><br />...Plus pure MDMA and caps is kinda a new thing that has only been around for 10 years.<br /><br />2. Another thing is....... Alot of the MDMA Pre-pressed pill have either Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, or Caffeine added to it.<br />So when you get pure molly, you are missing out on all those Extra Drugs, which I prefer, but some dont. So people dont have time, and resources to mix all that shit themselves at Mg levels. <br />Just buy, pop, and have a good time.<br /><br />Thats my opinion.&nbsp;
