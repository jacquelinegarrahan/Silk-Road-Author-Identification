				Hi I&#039;m pretty new to this world and wanted to know which strains are similar to Sour Diesel. I have not smoked this strain yet, but my friend says that it has been one of the best highs that he had and we&#039;re looking for some and some of similar strains so we have a variety to choose from.<br /><br />If anyone knows a good vendor with dank, AWESOME bud for a price that cannot be beat, please let me know!<br /><br />I&#039;m super excited to explore the different types of strains of Mary J :)<br /><br />EDIT: I want to know which vendors sell good bud that give similar highs as Sour D :P

				This may be an &quot;apples to oranges&quot; sort of comparison.&nbsp; As someone else said, SD is a sativa.&nbsp; If I remember correctly (entirely possible I do not), any strain with &quot;Kush&quot; in the name is likely an indica.&nbsp; The two types have very different effects on most folks, and it&#039;s a matter of preference. Google it if you need to know more.<br /><br />Alaskan Thunder Fuck is considered another fine sativa. So this may be more comparable to SD. In fact, I really can&#039;t tell the difference between the two.<br /><br />Anonymart is one vendor who generally has both ATF and SD.&nbsp; I&#039;ve purchased from him several times, and have been quite happy with the weed.

				this is indeed kind of an impossible question. first of all, start your journey over at *clearnet!* leafly.com and medicalmarijuanastrains.com *clearnet!* to get all kinds of comparisons and reports from all over the country/world. do a bunch of research if you&#039;re trying to get into weed snob status like you see here. <br /><br />then, do what the rest of us do; search the Road, research vendors who look good, and see what people are saying about the bud. not to mention, one woman&#039;s mediocre high is another woman&#039;s best high ever. I like hybrids that lean toward indica. you like sativas like Sour D (you should probably try Sour D too, obviously). read the descriptions and jump in with a strain that sounds awesome. <br /><br />last - if you want a personal recommendation, it&#039;s NorthWestDirect all day every day. no matter what you go with, it&#039;s bomb.

				/begin shameless_plug/<br />I have an AK x SD listed as well as Metal Haze.<br />I am a new vendor, but have sent out several samples and hope to get some reviews in the next couple days.<br />Ramrugger is getting one of those samples. He might just change his recommendation after getting it :)<br />/end shameless_plug/

				OG Kush (the original) plus many of its crosses are similar to Sour D, as well as popular on SR. Skywalker OG, Fire OG, and Wi-Fi OG are closer to the legit East Coast Sour Diesel which is strongly sativa dominant.<br /><br />Most people are actually getting various backcrosses and offshoots of Sour D because it&#039;s a rare clone only strain. Every time I&#039;ve seen it sold on the street outside of the East Coast, it&#039;s been either NYC Diesel, some OG, or the rezdawg IBL seed. There are at least a couple sellers on here that have the real deal Sour Diesel, but it&#039;s hard to catch unless you like keeping your account loaded.<br /><br />You can also find some chemdawg on here from time to time. It&#039;s a rumored parent of the sours, and you&#039;ll see why from the smell. To me, OG kush is more sour-like while Chemdawg is sedating but still close enough.<br /><br />

				honestly it really depends on how it is grown any strain can be bomb if is grow the right way !<br />best advice the herb is not brown, not too dried up, not wet, nice trimmed and less small bud, also spiky hair, and when you smoke it it doesnt kill your lungs, is like you smoke a pack of cigarette that like 1 dollar a pack and smoking a cig thats like 100 dollar a pack big difference
