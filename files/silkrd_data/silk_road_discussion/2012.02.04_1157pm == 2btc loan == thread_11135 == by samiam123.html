				Hello all, I am short 2 btc on a product I highly desire for the weekend sale. The banks are closed, and inventory for this product is running low. I will repay you within 14days, a return of 2.5 btc for your courtesy. I&#039;m sure we have all been in a similar situation, and some can sympathize. If anyone would be kind enough to fulfill the loan my btc address is: 1DmKonNCd8eppk8KGAXJCmtMSi9GEJRP9M<br /><br />Feel free to ask for my sr name if preferred. Thanks, and have a great day.

				Well, to be honest, I will be surprised if these coins actually come back to me...<br />Keep thinking positive, that&#039;s the main idea.

				Holy Shit, this community is awesome!<br /><br />As a noob here, slightly stoned on the shitty shag weed I&#039;m forced to inhale due to the&nbsp; current location and running through hoops via Paxum via Tradehill to SR, I think it&#039;s beautiful that people around here do this for each other.<br /><br />I&#039;m blown away!<br /><br />{But sadly, not as blown away as I&#039;d like to be availing of the awesome array chemical agents available here.)<br /><br />Yet :)

				Yeah. I&#039;m pretty sure u can kiss that BTC goodbye.<br /><br />There ought to be a WARNING about possible scams on all pages, pointing to a sticky of the kinds of scams that go on out here. There are these bunch of assholes who just keep getting people for small amounts over and over, and it makes me fucking mad.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11135.msg121296#msg121296">Quote from: radi8power on February 21, 2012, 09:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">samiam:<br />Your loan is overdue, and previous attempts to contact you have been ignored.<br />Please send 2.5BTC to 16WQRabACpax1LUsbvnPH3uTdxMuYgnCxt immediately.<br />You may also send funds directly to my SR buying account: radi8power<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
