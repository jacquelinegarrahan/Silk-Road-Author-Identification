				WTF happens to them? Did they die? <br /><br />I mean, I am looking at expanding my recreational use to a few other drugs. I check out vendor page. All looks great. But then get to the reviews. 90% of them are people who finalize early, say they haven&#039;t tried the product yet but will update when they do, and then never do. <br /><br />So I&#039;m sitting here like &quot;What the fuck? Did all these people snort up the same coke and die?!?! Did they all take the same hit of LSD and go bat-shit crazy and are in mental wards now?!&quot;. <br /><br />Basically, just requesting that if you finalize early and say you will be back with a review, please do it. It let&#039;s the rest of us know the quality and know you&#039;re not dead. <br /><br />

				I literally laughed out loud. Thanks. There&#039;s way too many of those people though. I&#039;ve decided to be the change I wish to see in the world by always updating after trying the product. Its really not that hard. It even makes me feel good.

				I agree, it&#039;s aggravating as shyte.&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; &nbsp;I assume that if they have not come back to update though, that the transaction went well.&nbsp; People are quick to bitch but, slow to praise.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				You are right. I detest to see this myself (I mean, how much does it really take to update the feedback once you tried the product, ffs?).<br /><br />It seems like many people really cannot understand that the feedback system is fundamental for users to base a meaningful decision upon. If you willingly leave irresponsible feedback you are like intentionally harming yourself and your future purchases.<br /><br />I always strive to give the more honest and detailed feedback as I can inside the boundaries of things that can be comfortably revealed. As all the systems that are based on a community, the more users behave as selfish and only think about themselves and their momentary gain of the moment without caring for the rest of the people, the less the community is trustworthy and this, in turn, reflects on the individual itself.

				Lol good then! I was like ooo no I am doing a disservice to the SR community... lol jp<br /><br />But ya, as soon as I get done trying them I will update. I think people just think that it is too much time and effort to go back and fix something when it is not themselves that get hurt by not adjusting it. In order for SR to work we need to provide feedback properly so people can make informed decisions.

				Haha! Great reason OP. +1<br /><br />To be honest I&#039;m one of those people that only updates after about 3 months when I go through and do them all.<br /><br />I&#039;d just assume that it is of good quality. If it was bad quality people would be really quick to update them!

In all these cases if the buyer agreed on the resolution it is as much probable that as in the case all got well that the buyer didn&#039;t update; actually in this case it is even more probable to not update because elsewhere (and this depends on the individual, but I&#039;m sure there are many many people that can do this) you risk the vendor not giving you what promised in case you do.<br /><br />So, after thinking about this point I didn&#039;t include this statement in my previous message, and if I think about this I understand how it is even MORE important to update feedback, because elsewhere people cannot understand when it&#039;s one or the other.

In case the order was received and it&#039;s just a matter of update on the product&#039;s quality, it is not said that the product is probably good because there&#039;s not an update (for the motives I&#039;ve mentioned in the previous post).<br /><br />Frankly I&#039;ve seen very very little 1s or 2s because of an update for very low/low quality of a product. I actually have seen, on the contrary, many updates mentioning the not so good quality yet giving 5 the same, as if for the motive I mentioned. When you see strings of 1s it is mostly because of scams (that naturally include scam in the product, but in this case it is something different than low quality) and orders not received.

You can give them bad feedback which will impact on their future sales, give them bad feedback in the forum etc. Plus with escrow I don&#039;t ever see a problem with someone who&#039;s sold 30 items and only a handful have updated with quality reviews. You have the power to challenge the transaction if you&#039;re not happy.<br /><br />Another problem I face is that I only have good addresses a few times a year so when I do I order a lot, test it if I have reagents or by look and smell depending on what I&#039;ve bought, and assume it&#039;s OK then use it in a couple of months. By that time my feedback is long gone.

				I think that&#039;s one of the reasons the forums exist, I never have looked at the feedback as a reliable source of the product&#039;s quality anyway because sometimes people&#039;s opinion are affected by tolerance amongst other things when giving a bad quality review. I&#039;ve seen so many people say something is &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;not that good&quot; when that wasn&#039;t true at all. As I said that&#039;s why I think the forums are a better source of finding out more about the product you are interested in anyway, if the product or vendor doesn&#039;t have a thread then create one for it/them. I&#039;m pretty sure the interaction would be more in detail that way anyhow.
