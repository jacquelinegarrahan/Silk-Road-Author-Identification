				...[edited out my suggestion because it was followed through and is no longer applicable]...<br /><br />I think the gun dealer has a more dangerous persona associated, even if its a false perception, and for some people there would definitely be increased hesitation to giving out personal details such as real name and home address. Assuming not all people actually have an alternate safe addy that is.<br /><br />If the gun dealer is using the same return address for guns and drugs (assuming guns are mailed), then in the case of a gun detention in transit, it could could increase the risk of drug buyers having their safe addy flagged too, maybe... (or maybe not, just a thought).<br /><br />

				Good point LexusMiles, the poll has been edited to reflect the change before anyone has voted for &quot;who cares,&quot; which I agree essentially is a &quot;hell no&quot; in this case. <br /><br />I find this discussion particularly intriguing because many mainstream drugs, particularly cocaine and heroin, are funneled thru organizations that DEFIANTLY are well armed and don&#039;t mind a bit adding people to the someone who got lost and never found list.&nbsp; One of the reasons I got out of the great white hope game was because of the high tension heavy armament situations that are almost certain if your connecting up anything worth fooling with.&nbsp; Well, that and the 2:30am phone calls &quot;hey, whats up?&quot;&nbsp; ME NOW YOU AHOLE!&nbsp; Seriously though, it is a bit ridiculous having several people all coked up and armed to the teeth with a really bad suspicious shoot a mofo first ask questions later attitude lol...<br /><br />Those of you that have or are going to vote that you would NOT BUY from anyone that has guns listed, I am curious:&nbsp; do you ever buy cocaine or heroin?

				i just wanna first comment that i think its hilarious that you quoted yourself lol<br /><br />Second i wouldnt be deterred from using someone if they sold guns or not, you still have the option of not buying it so i dont see how it should effect ones decision if they sell good product and at a good price, guns are also just another product of business and it is even safer with SR now that you dont gotta see someone and hope and pray shit dont go sour <br /><br />also anyone ive met that was &quot;strapped&quot; never really had the attitude of shoot first ask later even if they were coked out of their minds, theres stupid people out there and smart people out there so its best to just avoid the idiots with guns and stick to people with a little bit of education who will think first instead of just blasting you away, alot can come about from a shooting anyway even if they dont find someone it sure as hell will be hot wherever it went down <br /><br />So me no it wouldnt change a thing if someone sold guns but if SR dont want it then we should give him the respect of listening to his small set of rules<br />&nbsp;

				I respectfully submit to you L2Q that when your dealing with Mexican cartel DTO&#039;s I can assure you there will be high tension moments and plenty of coked out professional thugs with itchy trigger fingers.&nbsp; Almost all Peruvian and Colombian cocaine is funneled thru Mexican cartels now because the submarines they built didn&#039;t work well enough, the Navy was intercepting too many of the remote control sub&#039;s.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know who your rolling with but here&#039;s my *ahem* story:&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone I know not me (SWIM lol... yeah, thats right, fuck saying shit about the Zeta&#039;s - they&#039;ll cut your head off and hang you from a bridge with a warning note to others) went to go meet &quot;Hector the Machete Man&quot; at a storage unit building... upon entering the gate code and entering the place, SWIM noticed two very well placed ummm gentlemen that had .380 mac 10&#039;s with silencers perfectly positioned to &quot;cut the pie&quot; (some of you know what I&#039;m talking about)... +1 nervousness for SWIM... then SWIM goes around the building to the agreed upon storage unit... another &quot;gentleman&quot; is standing there, obviously armed to the teeth as well, and rolls up the storage building garage door... SWIM notices the two gentlemen at the front closing in from behind at optimum angles, pro&#039;s for sure...&nbsp; ratZZZ (Los Zeta&#039;s).&nbsp; The door rolls up and there&#039;s Hector with yep, you guessed it, his machete... +3 nervousness now for real.&nbsp; Hector calls SWIM in and invites him to have a seat at a table with about 40 kilos of bricks beside it.&nbsp; He tells SWIM to pick a brick and put it on the table.&nbsp; SWIM is nervous as hell...&nbsp; +5 by now cause this guys coked out of his mind and obviously a little crazy.&nbsp; SWIM picks a random brick and puts it on the table... no sooner than SWIM barely retracted his hand then WHAP!! Hector macheted the brick in two...&nbsp; +++10 nervousness!!!&nbsp; Hector, obviously enjoying this, tells SWIM to go ahead and check it out... SWIM tries a line (trying like hell to keep an eye on that damn machete,) and sure enough - pure D&#039;zzz.&nbsp; SWIM concludes his business with Hector and leaves, swearing to quit the great white hope game before shit goes wrong.<br /><br />Now that&#039;s as real as penitentiary steel.<br />Paperchasing<br />

				As a seller and seller of guns irl, I love to shoot. Relieves a lot of stress and it&#039;s just downright fun. <br /><br />Here in USA we have way more freedom than other countries and I feel sad that they cannot own a gun by simple going and buying one. I support the selling of guns on SR and I can sell some myself. <br /><br />Just shoot me a PM.

				@Fred Flinstone -&nbsp; I saw your post here but now its gone.&nbsp; I disagree with you about what your saying about this thread has already been done.&nbsp; Your poll is about an ADMINISTRATIVE action (prohibiting guns from being sold) whereas my Poll is about the BUYERS response to the real time on the ground situation right now, that is IF a vendor has guns for sale would it influence a BUYERS decision regarding purchasing drugs from them.&nbsp; Two different scenarios entirely.<br /><br />Paperchasing

				Okay…. I&#039;m buzzed, so what the hell.&nbsp; <br /><br />SR is a site that rejects the imposition of governmental regulation, yet (assuming democratic not some whacked theocracy) the government represents the collective; that is, the people.&nbsp; As much as many like to deny it, it&#039;s societies collective morality that dictates the direction the law moves - which evolves ever so slowly.&nbsp; Anyhow, not to revisit 3 grade civics class, but the irony is comical.&nbsp; &nbsp;Basically, the OP is advocating a limitation (assumption, of course) with it&#039;s own set of rules and regulations.&nbsp; Is the goal to impose limitations on a site that was designed to circumvent limitations? <br /><br />Think of it this way: X is okay but Y is not, and thus Z.&nbsp; Who determines X &amp; Y?&nbsp; X is legal.&nbsp; Y is illegal.&nbsp; Z is the conclusion.&nbsp; It&#039;s been awhile, but it&#039;s an intoxicated syllogism.&nbsp; Philosophy 101 was too long ago. <br /><br />If it matters, I take no position, but politically, I&#039;ll confess as a proponent of gun control.<br />

				Nice story paperchase<br /><br />perhaps you should write the script to the next shitty drug movie to come out. judging by your taste in music from your quotes and you most obviously being white I can conclude that your story is most likely not true, watching some documentaries on these gangs they do not like to operate with those who are not already associated with the gang or affiliated cliques, usually when you are working with these guys you are working or else no outs unless its with you dieing, ive dealt with many coke dealers and these guys dont even like to talk nor see anyone that they dont trust fully or know that your legit so how do you do a one time deal with a Zet leader. Good story, but im calling shenanigans, Doesnt matter if its true or not but wanted to state my facts&nbsp; <br /><br />To stay on topic I dont think the sales of guns should deter one from using someone for their drugs given that they are doing business with good shit and worthwhile prices dont see why it should really,

				MOney is money ok. And if your dealer also sells protection then shit thats easier on you and him. So you know hes not LE so I think its even safer to buy everything from as little amount of people as possible. <br /><br />I dont promote any type of violence at all, some people live in places where only the police are armed. And that is fucked up. If shit hits the fan you got your ass hanging out in the wind out to dry. I think if weopons are being sold, then I would hope they are not being sold to kids, people who plan on commiting crime with it or terrorist. <br /><br />There is no way to tell for sure but I would hope that most of the people looking for a weapon just want one for home security just in case they need to protect their family, house, possesions or land from harm. <br /><br />Some of you might think everyone looking for a gun wants to shoot or do something bad with it, thats not the case in every transaction. Those of us who actually respect them arent out to commit crimes with them, just to collect them. <br /><br />Saying every gun sold is used to commit a crime is like saying everyone who does drugs is a drug addict. The numbers would show their are more legally owned guns in this country that are never used to commit a crime then there are illegals guns that are. <br /><br />I went off topic but fuck it. <br /><br />-yes to guns on sr

				It&#039;s funny that someone here would believe that somehow it&#039;s right to limit individual freedom concerning guns but it&#039;s not ok to limit that freedom concerning drugs. All governments in the world want all their citizens to be criminals all the time so there is fear and an ability to arrest and imprison people that speak too loudly.<br /><br />Get over it on the guns. They&#039;re even protected by the Bill of Rights. Unfortunately, the founders didn&#039;t choose to protect the right to consume drugs and alcohol. So we had Prohibition 1 and we have now an endless war on drugs that is effectively Prohibition 2.

				I think gun sales are a fine. I voted Hell No. Just as going to a store where I knew the owner had a concealed carry permit wouldn&#039;t deter me, neither would a seller on here who also sells guns.<br />This means a seller who is more invested in what they&#039;re doing on SR, as well as a probably more cautious and better concealed package. I support the right to own a firearm and while I like the licensing system we have now to a certain extent, I also believe that guns should be available to those who can&#039;t get one within the system.

				man, I love drugs but not too fond of guns. That being said though, I wouldn&#039;t judge a person based solely on what they&#039;re selling =) What&#039;s on my mind is how synonymous the words, &quot;drugs&quot; and &quot;violence&quot; are. For the first time ever, someone&#039;s separated street drugs from the violence that&#039;s usually associated with it (viva SR!). Gun&#039;s don&#039;t kill people, people kill people. Drugs don&#039;t kill people, people on drugs with guns kill people.&nbsp; jk. <br /><br />Honestly though, to each his own paradise. <br /><br />Also.. if someone here was sellin guns and meth, and someone else was sellin sticks of dynamite and meth, I&#039;d buy from the guy with the dynamite. Because dynamite&#039;s just fucking cool e.g. Looney Toons. Wile E Coyote. It&#039;s funny how there&#039;s no stigma against dynamite. It&#039;s also funny how much I want to try Propofol. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Paperchasing, you&#039;ve got me thinking too hard. <br /><br />

				&nbsp;:) I do not care what you are selling. If I am interested and feel comfortable, I&#039;m going to go ahead and pull the trigger and buy. A gun or drugs. If you are not comfortable w/a deal then don&#039;t do it. <br /><br />&quot;Oh, Vendor #1 sells ILLEGALsubstanceS and I like um. But he also sells ContrabandA so I&#039;m out.&quot; That&#039;s silly! So you are going to beat a guy up for bringing as much variety as he can? He has a hook up and you bitch. Ridiculous!! Scared? Don&#039;t do it and move on.<br /><br />Thank goodness for SR and the variety in offerings it brings. TO OUR FUCKING DOORSTEPS, not the corner!! I personally welcome new vendors AND ALL THERE VARIOUS WARES. Bring what you got! AK, AR15, 50cals, real guns. Not 25&#039;s and 22&#039;s. No pea shooters!! <br /><br />I&#039;d like to see some MORE GUNS! I want to buy my Cocaine and Firearms in the same place. &quot;Next to the liquor store?&quot; No!&nbsp; Hahaha.

				If a vendor was selling items which included something particular to my interests such as drugs, yet that same vendor also sold weapons such as a gun, It would not bother me as I would only be interested in the item that I want to buy (drugs). If the vendors feedback and successful transaction history is good, I would have no problem making a transaction for an item other than the weapon. The vendor would not be my first choice if other sellers had the same product, but if it was the best and most cost effective choice I would still place an order with them...<br /><br />I don&#039;t condone violence or the use of a weapon but in one case when I do condone the selling of guns. Is when it is sold to help people protect themselves against THE REAL VIOLENT CRIMINALS!<br /><br />I live in South Africa and it is impossible for a white person to receive a gun license. No gun license&#039;s have been issued for the last 10 years. After Apartheid thousands of white people have had to turn in their weapons or face fines and possible other legal issues if they refused. Yet on the other hand while the South African government is disarming all it&#039;s citizens (Especially white people), criminals are using AK-47&#039;s just to carjack,house rob and even jack us for a mobile phone on the street. 99% percent of all house robberies in SA involve the criminal carrying a firearm.<br /><br />I have had to purchase a handgun illegally in South Africa purely for protection. How else am&nbsp; I going to sleep at night knowing I have nothing for protection whilst the intruder has enough firepower to kill a dozen people in an instant! <br />I am not a racist but the amount of farm attacks and attacks on the white folk are extremely brutal and terrifying. Yes it does often relate to Apartheid and that the white man had all the power once but people are being viciously attacked in revenge style murders just about every week...<br /><br />Sorry for a bit of a long answer but all in all I would not like to see any type of weapons sold on SR purely due to the fact that they cause a lot faster damage to society than drugs do, they attract way more LE attention than needed and also they attract negative attention in a community which prides itself on honesty, respect and peace.

				I figure, if a vendor can ship guns out without things getting heated then they should have no problem shipping drugs. Obviously everything depends on the reputation of the vendor. If it were you selling guns, paperchasing, I&#039;d certainly still buy your drugs. Plus the silk road needs a vendor like you when it comes to buying firearms. Hypothetically of course...

Gun enthusiasts have no trouble getting most guns. Some are illegal to buy though, and these I would support on SR for protective purposes or personal collection. The thing is, some of the people who want to anonymously buy guns which are easily obtainable legally are planning to do something illegal with them. Granted, there are people who don&#039;t plan on doing anything violent or illegal with them (probably the majority of buyers), but if guns are sold on SR, people will buy them and use them for violent purposes simply because it&#039;s nearly impossible to connect the gun with the owner. People will be injured/killed with guns purchased on SR if enough are bought and sold. That is a fact. The same goes for any black market arms dealer though. <br /><br />I do realize that people will kill/injure other people with guns whether or not SR sells them, but SR makes it easier for someone who wants to kill someone for any reason to get away with it assuming LE didn&#039;t discover or track the package and don&#039;t know the person owns a gun. It opens up the prospective market from people who know arms dealers to anyone who knows about SR.<br /><br />I agree that a ban on guns on SR is extremely hypocritical and don&#039;t personally believe the reasons above warrant a ban, but we do need to know the consequences of making guns available easily and anonymously to anyone through SR. I personally don&#039;t give a fuck if the vendor I buy from sells guns or not, and it shouldn&#039;t really mater.
