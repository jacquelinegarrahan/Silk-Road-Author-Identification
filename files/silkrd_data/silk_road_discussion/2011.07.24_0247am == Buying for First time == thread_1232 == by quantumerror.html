				I have registered on Silk Road, I processed my Bit Coins from my wallet and over in to my Silk Road account and now I would like to make a purchase.<br />I am having a very difficult time understanding the entire Public Key method or whatever that is...<br />I just don&#039;t want to go through the time to begin a transaction only to have the Seller cancel it because I&#039;m doing it wrong or something, and the Buyers Guide on Silk Road really doesn&#039;t have any instructions on keys or anything.<br /><br />When a seller includes their Public Key, what am I supposed to do with that?<br />Once I add the item to my cart, how do I make sure that the Seller will get my information in the way that I&#039;m supposed to?<br />I apologize for being so ignorant on this, I looked all around and did not find anything that I felt answered my question really, and I feel overwhelmed by some of this. GPG makes absolutely no sense to me and I really only want to know if I&#039;m missing something.

				Your Public PGP key is what you send to others for them to Encrypt a message to send to you. Then only you have the private key to decrypt this message. So when a seller provides a public key you use this to encrypt your address (or other sensitive information) to send to them. This encrypted message can only be decrypted by them using their Private key. As for exact techniques as to programs and step by step process to do this, there are many tutorials as Redrocket has mentioned.<br /><br />Welcome to SR, and enjoy that first purchase&nbsp; :)

				PGP looks pretty hard at first, and many of us go through what you are going through.&nbsp; Only way to learn it really, is through doing it.&nbsp; The sellers are doing us a favor, really, by publishing their public keys, as it means then we can encrypt our addresses to them.&nbsp; Since you probably have Windows, just google and download gpg4win.&nbsp; There is a built in tutorial on how to run&nbsp; it.&nbsp; A couple of hours and you&#039;&#039;ll get it.&nbsp; Post your public key on here, and I&#039;m sure one of us will send you an encrypted message, and you can send one back.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be overwhelmed by it all.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link:<br /><br />http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium.html<br /><br />And as stated, there are several other tutorials on here.&nbsp; But just scroll down the page on that link, and you&#039;ll sort it out.

				Lol, go easy on the OP. Its obvious that he had no clue what they were talking about with they said key, etc. So, he didn&#039;t even know what to look for.<br /><br />Anyways, at first I was going to require everyone use PGP/GPG but really, it only protects the buyer. So as a seller, yes, I would prefer everything done in PGP but when its all said and done, it really doesn&#039;t effect me if the buyer uses it or not. Its not my address thats going unencyrpted. So,yes,&nbsp; I am going to recommend it, but if they dont want to use it, or take the time to use it, then thats up to them. its their choice....

				Yeah it is rather tricky to understand.<br /><br />I&#039;d offer advice but I&#039;ve got PGP 9.12, and most have GPG, which probably has different ways of importing/exporting keys, and encrypting/decrypting messages.<br /><br />If you have PGP 9.x, post here and I&#039;ll write you a quick step by step guide.<br /><br />And if you work it out (regardless of what version you have), perhaps you could try sending me a message, using this public key I just made up specially for you!

				I don&#039;t usually expect new sellers to use pgp.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve gotten too many good deals by jumping quick, rather than waiting for sellers to get it perfect.&nbsp; I just encourage it, and try to take some time answering questions when they ask, as it is a bit confusing at first.&nbsp; It&#039;s always cool, tho, when you get that &#039;aha&#039; moment with pgp, and realize it&#039;s really a neat way of doing good, and how the public/private keys work is brilliant.&nbsp; Asymmetrical.&nbsp; I don&#039;t use email progams for it tho.&nbsp; But I&#039;m also a linux user with GPA rather than Kleopatra.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of fun, when u first figure it out.&nbsp;

				Hey&nbsp; quantumerror <br /><br /><br />I had a bit of trouble getting my head around the whole pgp setup, but i&#039;ll explain what i know as i think understanding the process first makes finding the route easier.<br /><br />Firstly, a PGP key consists of a few parts but to be honest you don&#039;t need to understand them all (If you have the time i recommend reading more on it, but not necessary) as you only really ever deal with one thing, Public Keys. This is what you see posted on the board and on sellers profile&#039;s. <br /><br />Your Public Key -<br /><br />Using your PGP software, you can create a key, you give out the Public key for users to send you messages that only you can read<br /><br />A Sellers Public Key -<br /><br />You Import this key into your PGP software which then allows you encrypt messages specifically for that user.<br /><br />The General Use of PGP in SR<br /><br />When you go to make a purchase, you will provide the seller with an address, this is often the place where PGP is recommended to be used as should god forbid SR ever be taken down by Law Enforcement and they manage to recover the messages sent between you and a seller, they will not be able to read the information without knowing your Private PGP Key (A private key is generated by your PGP software when you create your Public key (research more for better explanation) but generally you don&#039;t need to know it unless you change PC&#039;s, its used to un-encrypt messages encrypted using your Public Key). <br /><br />A) Import the sellers Public key to your PGP Software<br />B) Create a text file with the address and message you want to sent to the seller, also put in this text file your Public Key so they can reply in an encrypted message<br />C) Encrypt your text file using your PGP software, specify the output to be an ASCII/Text format<br />D) Copy the output and send it to the seller during a purchase<br />(Will look something like this)<br />-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />hQEOAxuN69EAQBr5EAQAma57YfLZRkPZurB6gJ6lCdgAC37GI7mNa/SjHfkFV5GG<br />+a0gNRplJvM4juHns+x2L0U5okvuJFaxSsgggWN/QLPO7c31qWPqWHOpa6Lbz1jk<br />v8WsQreU5QqNwzZlSCYKMlUP0BsrfVO6SIe2OddGPuRdMzGDOg2ADjdQbY3WEaUD<br />/iaum+z8EX3C3zUXc4rV087pCVxA1fRpHxbkNtITq0pggbr7LI7W+iVTDhc1ZkDy<br />mWSyDgrnwBztGwQ17Qi/TldV9dQwp/HptN3SeOW3fwMcBBhOV2o+gYJzYwOAnjEH<br />fCX7N6eOyPkw9PXNypApNTLW4FIAl0GTywgYFXTkmu6N0usBm7OnO8B0EnhH9HSf<br />WYFuclkiCMzksE/dCYZW4Kgz6PMmKDUPWK/ny8vbnsKqitSCJ7kxKR3em9zvTJLw<br />1Qzyiph3Lf5nZeGa6q+OLPFY2TeYzu5VWF+muabtnbGNVFDPfRtjdF/cWLsHXsI1<br />MQ3lOmi+1p2m7BEd/7LDT048K+YMQKLOVyG6KQ/ZYojfqagres+Cvj33WNq6bKsm<br /><br />-----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />That is the basics of it, how to use your PGP software differs on platforms (Linux, Mac, Win) but the process is always the same<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />Ninja

				Hey I&#039;m a fucking genius and even I had problems using PGP at first. Simple fact, PGP is not completely user friendly.<br /><br />Best advice is to figure out how to use it with a real life friend who also has a computer, send messages back and forth, etc... and then use it here.<br />

				The GPA user interface for windows is quite easy to use.<br />You just need to read the tutorials and ask someone to help you do a trial run with it.<br />I did that very thing with MissScarlett last night.<br />Most senior members are happy to help out for safety reasons.I<br />If you vendors without PGP dont get your act together....UGH.
