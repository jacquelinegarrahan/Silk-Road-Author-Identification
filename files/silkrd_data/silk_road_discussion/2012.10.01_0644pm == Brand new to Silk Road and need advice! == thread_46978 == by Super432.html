				Hello all! I am brand new to Silk Road ,and needless to say, I am pretty confused about the whole process of buying and selling. I want to be as safe as possible, and I&#039;ve read that I need an encrypter and decrypter. I don&#039;t exactly know where to find such things. If someone could just give some advice on how to encrypt and decrypt as well as how to buy and transfer bitcoins to my Silk Road account, I would be very appreciative. Thank you.

				I&#039;m not trying to be a jerk here, but the best advice/direction I can give you is to just read every stickied topic on the forum as well as the wiki. Once you&#039;ve done that, do it again. At that point, you really shouldn&#039;t have any questions.<br /><br />Don&#039;t order anything until you have a mastery of PGP, Tor and Bitcoin work. Otherwise, you risk it big.<br /><br />Nobody is going to post everything you need to know in this thread because it&#039;s all been posted elsewhere. Welcome, good luck and stay safe.
