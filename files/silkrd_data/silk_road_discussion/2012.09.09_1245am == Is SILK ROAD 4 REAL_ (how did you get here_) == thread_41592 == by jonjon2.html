				I first found my way through to silk road after months of searching, i got tipped of by the most unlikely of sources .. the source was an article on the BBC website about &quot;the dark web&quot; as they called it .. they explained how you could get drugs, and weapons and all sorts. obviously they weren&#039;t trying to promote it .. they were saying how dreadful it was lol .. but this article was crucial to finding of SR .. i always new there must be something like SR and this article jus made my beleifs stronger .. they also gave alot of clues on their article e.g. you have to download some software to access it and other things like &quot;they even have their own currency called BITCOIN&quot; .. all these clues helped me find SR .. and when i found it ... JESUS!! .. i cant explain to you how i felt ... i almost had a fukin boner LOL!! .. but it was amazing guys and girls .. everytime i come on SR i cant beleive i&#039;m here .. it dont get better than this :-D .. and every1 here is gr8 .. so guys any1 els wana share their story .. its cool if you dont but i had to share mine .. god bless guys ..

				I know you wanted to know how I got here, I can read and comprehend what I read... I just chose not to say how I found this place.. although I am high on the marrocan but no bud straight bt&#039;s <br /><br />as for how I got her, it seems like you&#039;d like to know so..... I found SR on the news and within 15 min had an account and was on my &#039;trip&quot; down the road.<br /><br />hopefully I&#039;ll never have to look back!

				I found this place back when that one news report came out...I ended up checking it out but it wasn&#039;t until now when I decided to use it. I really hope SR is around for awhile because I&#039;m just so surprised how easy this makes everything...was so sick of having to deal with the corner bullshit and buying in the not so nice areas everyday.

				Sorry for being &quot;that guy&quot;, but am I the only one who is seeing that people like the OP are going to eventually bring the site down?(or at least litter the forums) No offense to the OP, but he/she sounds like a 13 y/o, who is going to ask vendors to ship the product to abandoned houses and who is going to use false names. My opinion comes from his writing style and from the lack of skill of finding the threads where this kind of material should be posted to... A simple search could&#039;ve given him the answers :)<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I found Silk Road by accident really. I had a friend who told me about bitcoin mining making money (I wish I had build a mining rig when I first heard of it when 1BTC=~$.1) bitcoin led me to Tor, Tor landed me on hidden wiki, hidden wiki had a drug section anonsupply and such things. I thought it was all just a bunch of scams. Almost walked away from Tor altogether, but OVDB and Silk Road both actually looked like they could be legitimate, and I won&#039;t bore you with the rest because you all know Silk Road is legitimate, and OVDB was the bomb (until ene&#039;s bust R.I.P.)

				I was using Tor for a while before I found out about the hidden sites.&nbsp; Came across SR but it wasn&#039;t worth the effort (or percieved risk) at the time because I was living in a medical MJ area and had a script.&nbsp; Ended up moving to an area that is a bit less...enlightened? progressive? populated by backward dumb fucks? and remembered the Road.
