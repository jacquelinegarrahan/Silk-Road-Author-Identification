				Iv been giving karma also before and have no idea from who, but also i see i have i guess negative karma-6 and i dont understand why. I made a mistake as not knowing about much on vendor accounts and thought they were not as much as i said and they guy went on to tell me i was a dumbass a moron and stupid and didnt belong on SR which i could careless about words and people barking at me, but i didnt bother to even give him - karma or whatever that - thing is for,but since that day i went from having non to -6 lol, o well..I just started with the forms couple mnths ago, i enjoy getting to know and also see the feedback on vendors..I need help right now with my pgp set up issue so hopefully i will have that resolved asap
