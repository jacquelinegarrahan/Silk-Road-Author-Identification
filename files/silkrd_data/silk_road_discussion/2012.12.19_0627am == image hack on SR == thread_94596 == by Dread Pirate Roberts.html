				UPDATE:&nbsp; The issue has been resolved.&nbsp; The hole that lead to the hacker gaining access to other vendor&#039;s images and postage options has been plugged.&nbsp; I&#039;ve sent a message to all vendors asking them to update their images and postage options if their listings were affected, so hopefully the listings will be back to normal soon.&nbsp; I&#039;ve turned off incognito mode on all accounts, so if you were using incognito browsing before, you&#039;ll need to re-enable it on your setting page.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Hey gang,<br /><br />I&#039;m aware of the image hack that has taken place and am working with my team to fix the issue.&nbsp; Whoever was able to pull it off was is very skilled and clever.&nbsp; Hopefully no one has fallen for it and sent money to any of these mystery addresses in the images.&nbsp; So far as I can tell, the effect of the hack was limited to item images and no sensitive information has been leaked.<br /><br />I have switched the default view for all accounts to &quot;incognito&quot; so images won&#039;t show up.&nbsp; Also, it is looking like we will most likely lose the defaced images, so those will need to be re-uploaded.<br /><br />I&#039;m terribly sorry for the trouble this is causing, and we will get it cleaned up asap.<br /><br />- -DPR<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQ0V3+AAoJEAIiQjtnt/ol61wIAJgLMU7G9afQIPcEP11QQUfu<br />nvYAnM+BGsh6U/I65r5p7WzoLlIWTl+1mRIg3YNXMT/6UTphOMFKOv6/XXJig5o/<br />edja/1+5UJhLeOpXNuDlJDrLJqFGqGKu/swIn0rT2AmmxrgBcXYX+QUnoEZ4lJct<br />qMcKVX/j6PnWoT62RfmS5cirvbR7R6DB/ahzaVlihjx+XYzw5PiSmPthivQlUiLB<br />9XWibiO73kxq2cw/+hVvnhHFKbME1Ima1Q/JVX0knY+oAXIW0jeTrg7irDlg7ObL<br />Xn/w8WJ4GQ+qUkKn/jaY8Im3sFWLXDzWgC+VAAhmatEn49eSraVFA7kVX91tF6Q=<br />=LZjl<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

				As long as it is fixed you&#039;re the man! <br /><br />Also, would you think the hacker is the one responsible for the weird shipping option bug? They take out shipping options, then hope the customer will be using the hack address as it is now the only way to &quot;pay&quot; for their item?<br /><br />

				Notice how you&#039;re less likely to order something without the pictures even if you know what it is? Who would benefit the most from a hack like this? Think about it. The hack is not exactly genius, but it&#039;s outside the square, I&#039;ll concede that.

				As an introductory post, I just wanted to express how impressed I am by the foundation that has been laid in order to keep the members of this community as anonymous as possible. I was quite excited as I learned more and more, lurking through the forums, about the standards that have been set. Also, I like drugs. <br /><br />That being said, perhaps a link to this announcement on the main site in the &quot;news&quot; section would help a broader range of SRers through this confusing dilemma. Just a suggestion. <br /><br />Keep up the awesome work! btw, i like drugs.

				DPR<br /><br />We have great respect for what you have created but your site has been compromised, your top 10 Vendors of which I am one are under attack and all you&#039;ve done is switch to incognito mode?<br /><br />It&#039;s not just an image hack there is also no way to add a postage amount to a listing so there&#039;s at least 2 frames of the site compromised. <br /><br />We are going to have to delete every affected listing and create multiple listings with seperate postage options built into the title and price and have no pictures. <br /><br />This will create a massive amount of extra work for me in the New Year when I will have maybe 20-25 extra listings to create because of this. <br /><br />Lastly if you haven&#039;t found a solution you could at least make let your vendors and customers know whether you know how they did it and whether you&#039;ve stopped it from happening to new listings. <br /><br />I honestly think the site should be taken down. You&#039;ve been hacked, really hacked for the first time ever and I&#039;m sorry but you just don&#039;t seem concerned enough for me. <br /><br />Apart from Leo closing you down this is as bad as things can get.<br /><br />As I&#039;ve said I have great respect for you but I&#039;m one of your top sellers and keeping the site live whilst compromised is fucking madness bro. <br /><br />KS &amp; CZ <br /><br />The boys at the ChillZon3<br /><br />

				It seems like they have no idea how they are being hacked.&nbsp; Maybe they are leaving the site up hoping to figure it out by watching it happen versus taking it down and looking at each other saying WTF.<br /><br />Based on how OR works I originally assumed this had to be some sort of SQL injection attack but you&#039;d think that would be very obvious in the DB logs so I don&#039;t know what gives now that they are looking at it and still don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Malware on the image server itself?&nbsp; &nbsp;But that wouldnt explain all the shipping issues....

				I&#039;m honestly surprised the site is still up - I assumed it would be taken down ASAP once DPR was able to - seems like there&#039;s multiple vulnerabilities right now, and they&#039;re not 100% sure how to fix it.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to be able to order (and I guess I can), but feel like it&#039;s a bit of a gamble sending BTC right now.&nbsp; Guess we gotta just wait and see what happens

				Thanks DPR,<br /><br />Regarding the shipping options, while these can be corrected, they are still being re-deleted every couple of hours. And the changing images are still happening currently - not just an event in the past. Just so you have that feedback...<br /><br />I disagree that the site needs to come down, but perhaps an explanation on the front page would help. Explaining to newly logged-in people (most who don&#039;t come on the forums) why the images are missing, and also letting them know to message their vendor if the shipping options are missing - and explaining why this is so. Otherwise people will just be confused and that will be bad for SR&#039;s reputation.<br /><br />BG

				Thanks for the update. First time user here but I&#039;ve lurked around for the last year or so.

				Hopefully, its likely the database holding image data is not the same as the db holding any sensitive site data (and that may be encrypted as well).&nbsp; To reduce load and improve security for SR and its application, the databases may be on a different servers/IPs - my guess is the attacker could have somehow found the image database server that posts images to the client and used a vulnerability with tor or some graphics library, etc.&nbsp;

				I agree, some kind of notice on the SR homepage might have saved some people from getting mugged by this scam.&nbsp; The Welcome page is where we all arrive on the site, so that might&#039;ve been the best place to announce the issue to vendors and buyers alike.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose the DPR and co. didn&#039;t want to alarm people....?<br /><br />I like idiotkids comment &#039;you scamming fuck&#039;.&nbsp; Agree, it&#039;s hard to believe anyone would send 92 btc to a random wallet, but I&#039;ve no doubt that inexperienced users have lost some coins to the Quickbuy scam.<br /><br />Well, my xmas/new year orders have been placed and are all marked in transit.

				Well as of 30 minutes ago, I&#039;m now out 3 BTC. It&#039;s a minor annoyance more than anything I just feel that there should have been a link to this forum posted on the front page (there&#039;s not). I tried multiple times to buy the item through shipping and all but was unable to. The pictures are still all over the site and I think some vendors haven&#039;t logged on yet. So the tainted images will sit there until said vendor logs on and takes action. Please just delete the affected pictures, I know I&#039;m not the only one who&#039;s made the mistake of sending funds to the quickbuy. Some people may lose a serious amount of money.

I can&#039;t place an order regularly, so I&#039;ll just send the bitcoins to this address I can&#039;t even copy and paste and that is not reversible, and then I&#039;ll just send a message to the vendor for the goods?&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone did get ripped off on this scam, they deserve it more than anyone who loses money finalizing early.<br /><br />Okay, enough ripping on bozos around here, but I will add that the beginners complaining about lack of warning etc, need to read up.&nbsp; I probably spent a month or two hanging around this site when i first joined, learning to use pgp, buy bitcoins, learning about vendors, etc.&nbsp; If you think this is something you can just jump into, you&#039;re going to get exactly what&#039;s coming to you.<br /><br />I suppose I&#039;ll also take this moment to say that everything seems to be working great on the site.&nbsp; Got two orders placed yesterday, and even got an order in the mail today.&nbsp; As always, thanks for everything DPR and the SR community.

				I have to say there are still quite a few items that still have the hacked pic that will not allow you to select the shipping options:<br />I have been trying all kinds of machines, browsers, and anything else I can think of. It&#039;s fairly important that I can place an order this evening. Here is the link, maybe it can be repaired:&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4004ddf7c2&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve always had a great relationship with this vendor. Is it possible to replace the image with a non infected/no picture???<br /><br />I thought everything was fixed, guess not. Please see what you can do.<br /><br />Thanks!

				We were able to replace our pictures with new ones and have been monitoring them today.&nbsp; They have not changed and the postage options are still there.&nbsp; Best guess is the vendor you are talking about just hasn&#039;t logged in yet today to correct the problem.&nbsp;
