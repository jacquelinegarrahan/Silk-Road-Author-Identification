				Head over to coinbase, click on &#039;transactions&#039; and then &#039;advanced details&#039; and you should see where it is at in the chain.

				Your coins are missing now forever. If you had sent them correctly, there should have been a <br />&quot;Approximate time [in minutes] till BTC appears in SR Wallet&quot; followed by a rough estimate. It&#039;s usually anywhere from 4 to 11 minutes.<br /><br />Shit man.. sorry to hear this..

				.. that was a joke.<br /><br />Do you see where it says &quot;Confirmations 0&quot;? That means there have been 0 confirmations of the transaction on the blockchain yet. Meaning, after a few confirmations your BTC will show up wherever you were sending them. Relax, and wait. If its SR, it CAN (but doesn&#039;t usually) take up to 6 hours. Usually under an hour.. sometimes under 30 minutes. <br /><br />Although, DPR did post in another thread that widthraws are paused for the time being.. but I am not sure how/if that affects incoming BTC.<br /><br />In any case, just wait. They will &quot;show up&quot;.

				<br />&nbsp;Have a look here&nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206110.0<br />Coins usually show after 6 confirmations.<br />In the past I have had to wait between 24hrs and 2 days for a deposit to hit my acc.<br />I always follow the chain from here&nbsp; http://blockchain.info/&nbsp; , put the wallet address in the search and it will let you follow the confirmations.<br />C

				Hey man, coinbase takes like 5-7 days to get you your coin. Some where on your CB account page there will be a ling to that when clicked gives you the exact date and approximate time you will see your coin in the provided wallet address.

				I am glad to see this post. I sent mine almost 1hr ago and it usually hits in less than 10 min, always almost instant , so I was a little worried, then found this post. love these forums and most people on here. Still not in wallet but can rest a little easier knowing not the only one oh and on 8 confirmations of blockchain
