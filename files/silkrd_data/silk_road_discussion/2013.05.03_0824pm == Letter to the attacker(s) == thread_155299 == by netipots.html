				Silkroad has been in business since early 09&#039; if I&#039;m correct, not sure of this but no matter what you do or how you do it we will succeed as a community. No matter how much you ddos or exploit the site vulnerabilities we will come out stronger than ever! We as a community should warn these motherfuckers we are not to be fucked with. <br /><br />So if your reading this, just learn this you will never stop a community that believes in freedom, theirs always a way to bypass governmental tyrannical tactics. We human beings knows what is right for us so fuck your laws and your point of views. To the attacker(s) for you to judge us is wrong so stop this non-sense so we can all get back to business. This has to end some way or another you will be exposed either way.<br /><br />You have been warned, WE will expose you. Stop your bullshit it&#039;s getting pretty boring.<br /><br /><br />-netipots<br /><br /><br />P.S - All the community can chime in and let these governmental agencies or rogue attacker(s), that we are not alone we have a community that will never fail let it be known we will succeed!&nbsp; We are in the times of struggle but we will win cause we are stronger than them, we have a voice. That voice will be heard soon. <br /><br />Thank you DPR for your hard work, we will always be with you.

				(y) I feel the same, but lets not poke at a hornets nest.. We have prevailed like we knew we would, but we dont know the full details of how, Its possible DPR may of had to deal with this guy, we dont and wont know.. <br /><br />Im sure there have been things looked deeper into and tactics changed and a whole over look of our chess board set up as well, but still it can happen again. If it can be built by a great Man like DPR and team, then someone with enough Determination Bent on $,blackmail and destruction there are ways as we all witnessed again it can be crippled.. <br /><br />So Imo lets just be happy the road is up and running smooth and Paradise as we know it Continues .. LONG LIVE SR!!!!!&nbsp;

				I agree, SR is a huge tool for us liberty-seekers. We must protect it from those who wish to do it (us) harm.<br />I don&#039;t think the government was behind the attacks though at least not on SR, maybe the BTC drop had something to do with nefarious government motives.<br /><br />But the government would be worried about people adopting crypto-currency and it replacing the pyramid scheme they have going on with the Fed. After reading a couple other users&#039; theories about these attacks, i think it would be someone who wants to threaten the site to make money through negotiation with DPR or just take over and &#039;steal&#039; everyone&#039;s BTC. <br /><br />Even though this is anonymous, you&#039;re right we are a community. Despite being anonymous and based off of illegal stuff, we all are pretty close-knit and have very similar opinions on freedom and libertarianism etc. <br /><br />Screw you attackers, you don&#039;t know who you&#039;re messing with!

				I think Sr is under attack by the DEA or other drug agencies and this will be there tactic from now on. <br /><br />Reason is simple they can play the anonymous game as well we cant find them. So instead of shutting us down which they cant do they will attack us so we cant operate. They will eventually do it to every blackmarket that gains&nbsp; power and respect like SR this is likely just the test case. <br /><br />DPR, BMR, Atlantis should start figuring out a way around this issue because long term this could be new normal.
