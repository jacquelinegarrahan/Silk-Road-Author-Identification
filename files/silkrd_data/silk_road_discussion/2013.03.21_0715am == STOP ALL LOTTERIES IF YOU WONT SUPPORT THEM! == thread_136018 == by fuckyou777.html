A different type of lottery, with a trusted vendor, but still.&nbsp; I wonder why SR does not get involved with lotteries in general.&nbsp; Maybe they used to be gambling addicts and wish to stay away?&nbsp; Sobriety is hard to come by these days ;).&nbsp; Regardless, I believe that&#039;s a bunch of shit.&nbsp; I believe they should, at least, take a look at the situation to see if there is a resolution available.&nbsp; If SR is allowing scammers, then I suppose only the Vendors are truly protected here...... That is not a good image to throw out to the customers, whom are supposedly always right. Hm.... thanks for the information, I might have to avoid certain lotteries, or all of them.&nbsp; On another note, lotteries are a quick way to get stats for vending.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a great way to &quot;fix&quot; bad stats.&nbsp; &quot;F.E., for lotto&quot; gives a 5/5 basically every time (unless ur the dude who made this thread, I bet.).&nbsp; This could be a way vendors could manipulate the &quot;system&quot; put in place to &quot;protect&quot; the consumers/customers.&nbsp; This is concerning.&nbsp; I do not believe it will make, or break, SR.&nbsp; I just want to know what happened to the love, and protecting one another?&nbsp; I suppose the customer is on the bottom of this &quot;ladder&quot; though.&nbsp; Without vendors, customers would not be here.&nbsp; This goes both ways though.&nbsp; The demand will always be there (for drugs).&nbsp; I suppose it is the supply that is limited (and the prices reflect this).&nbsp; Yawn.&nbsp; Time to get back to work :D.<br />-Roxors

				Any vendor who runs &quot;lotteries&quot; is suspect IMO<br /><br />anyone who plays lotteries (in real life and on silk road) is a fool.

				I actually won 2 btc in a lottery, it was nice. Also...I received my first refund from kushkush. Non delivery on a domestic order. I&#039;m convinced they run the lotto just so they have any feedback at all, as seemingly few actually received anything in the last 1.5 months.
