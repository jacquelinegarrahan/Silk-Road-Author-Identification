				So I want to try some new &quot;party drugs&quot;&nbsp; I have done coke, extasy, mdma and methylone.&nbsp; Honestly I had some great methylone from DrG0nzo I took 300~ MG this Saturday and I was grabbing sexy women left and right and they were loving me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had good rolls on extasy like that before and mdma, but something about that methylone had me in the zone.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any other party drugs you guys can recommend that aren&#039;t trippy like lsd / shrooms?&nbsp;

				If you want to know about pill making just take a look at this site: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://www.lfatabletpresses.co.uk/</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> you can order a manual pill press for 30 euros if you want to do your own E pills .. but this is useless because real E pills are made with 600-1500$ automatic pills press and the prints are made with special punch die that generally work only with automatic pill press.
