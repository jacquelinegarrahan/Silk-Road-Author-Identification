				Hello all, I was thinking about this, and I&#039;m not sure if anyone has discussed vendors being cautious about leaving finger prints on any part of the letter/package they are shipping. I think taking an extra measure to protect yourself from being identified would be to wear gloves during shipping the contents of the items such as baggies and other things to which finger prints could be recovered.

				Do people realize that fingerprints don&#039;t mean anything... unless you are a convicted felon and the gov&#039;t already has your prints?

Two layers of gloves actually, most disposable gloves are too thin and can still leave fingerprints especially after being worn for an extended period of time. Vendors also have to be careful not to leave any DNA evidence in the packages.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12214.msg114981#msg114981">Quote from: slackjawed on February 15, 2012, 03:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12214.msg114849#msg114849">Quote from: Riceflair on February 15, 2012, 02:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Hello all, I was thinking about this, and I&#039;m not sure if anyone has discussed vendors being cautious about leaving finger prints on any part of the letter/package they are shipping.
