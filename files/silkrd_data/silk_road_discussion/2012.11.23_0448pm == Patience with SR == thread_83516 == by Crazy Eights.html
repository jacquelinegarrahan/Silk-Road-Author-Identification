				I have had my buyer account on SR for a little less that 1 year now, and there&#039;s all ways been outages here and there and other speed bumps we&#039;ve endured. Recently it&#039;s got worse.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;We fail to understand though this is not eBay or Amazon it&#039;s an online drug market place, so SR will not have the uptime those corporate websites do.. I do commend DPR on being able to pull off one of the largest privite internet success stories.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;That brings to my next point with the site growing so large and quickly;<br /><br />3 things most likely will occur<br /><br />* more downtime and outage<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;* more worldwide attention to SR via the media which will fuel law enforcement to step up efforts to close SR<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;* hackers are already at door and trying to figure different methods for disruption and thievery<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I think the lines communication could be better I know DPR tries, but no one wants to hear nothing as that brings the gossiping, fear of losing money that&#039;s tied up in SR, and the few wanks that like to stir shit up.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Most large enterprises have boards of directors, stockholders and other decision makers. I think SR is at the point where having a single source decision decison maker (DPR) as bright as he maybe should be blended in with what the users or SR feel is the right thing to do. Set up a poll for decision that directly impact members<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Example..<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;SR is allowing new accounts. I would have put this to vote to the SR members. My reasons are:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;*Due to the recent increased membership or &quot;explosive growth&quot;, I believe was the official description why SR was down a week<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;*The &quot;Authentication problem&quot; for today/yesterday<br /><br />A monthly quota of new accounts should be put in place. This would curtail some problems with SR website&#039;s performance. It would also not allow those scumbag scammers to operate with so many new accounts.<br /><br />I&#039;ll continue to stand with SR.. but I feel we should have a say in matters that effect us. <br /><br />I&#039;d put to vote other things such requests for enhances to the site, as something are more important to others.<br /><br />Again it&#039;s a privilege to be here.. but patience is something we all have very little of at times.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I would agree that SR needs to close the doors now or at least only open them for a short period at a time.<br /><br />I can only liken it to private torrent tracker. Once a tracker becomes full to &quot;capacity&quot; it will close membership. From there an invite system can be implemented (all tho I don&#039;t think that could be used here). But they do open up for a few days every few months or so to allow new members to replace inactive ones.<br /><br />Like it or not, SR it is well over capacity. I have been a member for over a year now and slowly seen it decline to practically unusable. <br /><br />Close the doors, leave the hackers and tourists outside.

				I am aware of a few people that have been busted using that site, whats worse is the lack of certain failsafes that are here for both seller and buyer protection. <br /><br />I believe in what DPR is doing and believe that he will do what is best for his profits, which in turn will be what is best for those enabling him to profit. A perfect example of a free market doing what it does best, operating maybe not as easy as going to the corner store, but freely- <br /><br />I willingly take the lumps, for the benefits of doing business here. <br /><br /><br />
