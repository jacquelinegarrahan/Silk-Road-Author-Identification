				Hello all... I just found this place out of sheer luck. I recently moved to a new city and miss my old college/raving days, but have no legit connections. I have been researching vendors, methods, etc for the past week and I am about to make my first purchase. I am wondering the following:<br /><br />1.) I have my btc in my email address and I want to send them directly to SR via coinapult. Whenever I put my address in the &quot;to&quot; field it comes up with an error. Is it not possible to send from coinapult to SR? Do I need a wallet (didn&#039;t think this was the case because SR acts as a wallet)?<br /><br />2.) When making my purchase I&#039;ve seen all kinds of advice on how to set up the ship to address. Some say use a friend&#039;s place-- others believe it&#039;s not necessary. Suppose I live in an apartment complex with multiple mailboxes all in one building. Would I be absolutely asking for trouble if I had my product sent here? <br /><br />3.) Also, does anyone here not encrypt their physical address when shipping? I am a bit down on my computer skills and the looks of all that GPG stuff screams *facepalm* to me.<br /><br />Thanks a lot for your help and keep fighting the good fight! I never knew this place even existed and when I found it... Disbelief at how a blackmarket community can come together and function well. Definitely awesome!

				Thanks for the links... I will definitely read up on encryption... looks like I&#039;ll have to get with it if I hope to do much in the community.
