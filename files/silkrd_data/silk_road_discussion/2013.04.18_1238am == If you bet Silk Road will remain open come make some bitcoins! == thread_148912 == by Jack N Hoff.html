				So I found a bitcoin better site and there is a bet on there that Silk Road will be closed by July 1st of this year.&nbsp; I disagree and so do most of the people betting.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Silk Road will be closed by July 1st, 2013<br /><br />The black (and grey) market site will be closed permanently by 12:01am UTC, 1/7/2013 (or 7/1/2013 for Americans).<br /><br />It does not matter whether it is shutdown by law enforcement (DEA, FBI, whatever) or whether Silk Road staff shut it down and returned any funds owed to users or even if they absconded with whatever BTC they had left in the site when they ran. The site moving to a different hidden/darknet address does not count as shutting the site down. Shutting the site down means all operations have ceased.<br /><br /><br />Info<br />Opening date: Sept. 19, 2012<br />Bet deadline: June 29, 2013 end of day Eastern Time<br />Event date: July 1, 2013 end of day Eastern Time<br />Category: Other<br />Total agree bets: 0.20<br />Total disagree bets: 3.48<br />Total weighted agree bets: 1309.821<br />Total weighted disagree bets: 16714.973<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=688

				I saw this over on BitCoinTalk; but, I&#039;m not too familiar with the mechanics of the betting system. <br /><br />How much does one have to put down and what sort of profit (with the current weights) would one be looking to make?

				Yeah, I think SR is gunna be pretty god damn hard for LE to shut down, and really unlikely DPR will shut it down.<br />However, I think as it gets more popular, mail customs are getting stricter. And with e-mail replacing mail these days, it&#039;s going to be really easy for customs to inspect each product and know what to look for.
