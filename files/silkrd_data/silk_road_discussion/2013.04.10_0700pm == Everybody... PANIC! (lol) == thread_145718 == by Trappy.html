				Pretty much every bitcoin service is down &amp; suffering a DDOS attack, aside from the silk road,<br /><br />Now, I&#039;m quivering in my boots because I&#039;m an idiot, but... now is your chance to buy cheap. Panic monkeys are going to knock it all the way down to 100 dollars. <br /><br /><br />BUY CHEAP, it&#039;ll be hours before everything is back to normal, I&#039;m shitting myself as I placed a big order at the height of the price, but who knows how high it&#039;ll spike after you fuckers buy it back up.

				I was sitting at a coffee shop studying, with the intent to hit the bank and load some money online for a bitcoin purchase. I was suddenly seized by an uncontrollable urge to shit. I guess reason flew out the window, because rather than using the coffee shop toilet, I ran to the car and sped home. Now I definitely won&#039;t be able to get to a bank before closing time. <br /><br />Panic&#039;d.

				Whatever happens today doesn&#039;t give us any idea what will happen tomorrow, which is the same situation that we were in yesterday, last week, ...<br /><br />Price tomorrow at this time could be $20 or it could be $300 - anyone who tells you they can predict is fooling you and/or themselves.<br /><br />We all need to get the bitcoins we need to purchase on SR, do our purchases, and not worry about what might have been if we didn&#039;t purchase. Any lag time in the various steps exposes us to some $/BTC exchange rate risk - think of it as trading the risks of street dealing with those of virtual currency dealing.<br /><br />The scary thing is that since BTC is not connected to anything tangible, there are not the normal checks and balances you get with legacy currencies. We&#039;re all just along for the ride.1
