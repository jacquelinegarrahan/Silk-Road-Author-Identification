				Questions- do the vet buyers out there ever do lottos?&nbsp; Do many established vendors do lottos?&nbsp; Have you ever won one?<br /><br />I ask because it seems like a great way to easily get scammed (buyer) or your rating killed (vendor) if people wanted (depending on price?).&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly new here, so just curious how often people do lotto.&nbsp; I did one one time and have no clue who even won.....<br /><br />If vendors are going to do a lotto shouldn&#039;t they:<br /><br />1. list the number of tickets<br />2. list the &quot;drop dead date&quot; when the event should be over<br />3. post who the winner is at the end of the event<br /><br />Iono just some thoughts, its interesting because by doing a lotto, you are counting on the fact that the vendor will in fact give the product to &quot;some&quot; winner and for that matter not just some other fake member or friend on the site.<br />

				They&#039;re mostly going to be scams, it&#039;s not possible to monitor or regulate them so sellers can just say whatever they want.

				I don&#039;t do them because it is too easy for them to get a fake &quot;buyer&quot; and select them as the lotto winner.

				I did for my favorite benzo seller at the time.&nbsp; He became a scammer right after the lotto but I was a regular.&nbsp; I won right after the lotto started because he was so surprised I bought it two minutes after the lotto listing went up.&nbsp; Won 40 valiums for 2 bucks :)<br /><br />It was paythepiper.

				I do it from only Trusted Vendors. I have one a Gram of Coke from GodOFAll and an 8ball and was extremely satisfied! I wrote a review for them too, I think that it&#039;s a fun and inexpensive way to use extra BTCs. <br /><br />Also, both times I have won I have become a regular customer for that person. So it isn&#039;t like they don&#039;t have anything to gain from these Lottos.

				i won&#039;t buy from any vendor that runs &quot;lottos&quot; (actually, they&#039;re technically raffles, but whatever).&nbsp; If one of my favorite vendors announce they were going to start doing these raffles, I would be very suspicious and probably stop buying from them.<br /><br />99% of the time its just a way for a &quot;vendor&quot; to quickly rack up a good rating and then scam a bunch of people.<br /><br />also, for similar reasons, I won&#039;t buy from any vendor that sells heroin.

				I&#039;d say it&#039;s pretty unfair to not buy from a vendor who happens to sell heroin. I&#039;m sure a fair amount of vendors out there are business minded and simply sell it because it is a commodity with value. And to label heroin users as consumers that are bound to try to scam is also unfair, especially when it is impossible to do so if the vendor ships w/ DCN.<br /><br />Just my two cents... I personally don&#039;t use H but w/e floats ones boat&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ll always buy a cheap lotto ticket from a vendor I trust. Yet to win though. Be careful which ones you enter, raffles are easily gamed especially the ones that seem to run forever.

				i said it, and i don&#039;t think its unfair at all.&nbsp; i make ethical decisions about where i spend my money all the time.&nbsp; If it makes you feel any better, i boycott vendors who sell cocaine too.&nbsp; I think both of those drugs victimize everyone involved in their production, distribution, and consumption, and i won&#039;t support it.&nbsp; IMO, the only real voice/vote you have in this world is how you spend your money.
