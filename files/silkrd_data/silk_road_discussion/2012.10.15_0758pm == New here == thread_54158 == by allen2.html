				Hi guys, glad to join this amazing community :)<br />I really hope you can help me and my friend. (I&#039;m not english nor american, so forgive any grammar error please)<br /><br />I&#039;ll cut it short : I&#039;ve never do drugs, nor my sweet friend did besides painkillers.<br /><br />She suffers from OI - it means she broke every bone of her body many times.<br />She&#039;s just 18, and she&#039;s a tough one, but she can&#039;t take painkillers no more and need opiates to Survive - the pain is too much for her to bear it any longer.<br /><br />She desperately asked me to purchase her some heroin.<br />You can&#039;t guess how much she suffers everyday.<br /><br />Well, I&#039;m not into drugs at all, but I can&#039;t stand seeing her this way, so I felt I had to agree and try.<br />Fact is that I know No One who sells opiates here, and I really don&#039;t know how to fulfill my promise.<br /><br />I&#039;d like some reccomendations, if you please...<br />I&#039;d prefer an italian seller, and if someone could reassure me telling me shipping is pretty &#039;safe&#039;...<br /><br />one more thing : what about ฿ ?<br />How can I get&#039;em?<br /><br />Should I get a postpay or what?<br />(excuse me, I&#039;m such a &#039;&#039;noob&#039;&#039; :) )<br /><br />Please help us.<br />We were thinking about buying 1 gram.<br />I&#039;m just gonna bring it to her (she almost can&#039;t leave her house, and she&#039;s on a wheelchair anyway).<br /><br />Who knows how OI works will know that there&#039;s no many expectations for a long life. In fact is the contrary.<br /><br />I&#039;m italian, she&#039;s an american who lives in my city now.<br /><br />Please, please help us.<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Allen

				I would contact the vendor &#039;Italiano&#039; on either the forum or SR.&nbsp; He looks trustworthy to me, speaks Italian, and may be able to guide you in the right direction.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Doctors haven&#039;t given her Fentanyl Patches for breakthrough pain?<br />Personally you story has holes in it to me.<br />Pain Killers = Opiates<br />Sounds like Skeletal Relaxers might be worth looking into.<br />Heroin is an unregulated narcotic...these means it could have anything from shoe polish to dandruff in it.<br /><br />IDK just rambling let me ponder this thread and more information would be helpful.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad

Make sure you use their escrow system, if you come across a good seller based on reviews just ignore him.<br /><br />Wish you all the best buddy, I really appreciate what you&#039;re doing :)<br /><br />

And I wanted to Stress how much I want her to have what she wants.<br /><br />Yay, she knows about heroin; I know about heroin. I&#039;m not good enough in english to properly explain the situation, but facts are what follows : she needs some release, she can&#039;t purchase heroin running around - both because she&#039;s on a wheelchair and she doesn&#039;t know any addict (nor do I), she&#039;s not gonna live much longer than this.<br /><br />But it seems like we can&#039;t do anything on SR anyway. We&#039;re not good enough to feel sure about how correctly we&#039;re using Tor - &#039;Italiano&#039; doesn&#039;t sell heroin and doesn&#039;t sell stuff to new buyers anyway.<br /><br />So I guess I&#039;ll have to sort something else out...<br /><br />just please, don&#039;t think I made up this story to get drugs. Have nothing against addicts, but I&#039;m not an addict myself and Mostly I&#039;d never use such a cheesy bullshit to purchase drugs. Please, believe me. I can understand you probably read crap most of the time and have to cope with a lot of bad people / liars / scammers and so on, but we&#039;re not.<br /><br />I can assure you we&#039;re desperated. <br />When I logged in I thought somebody deleted my topic because of the bitcoins question, and I&#039;m glad you didn&#039;t.<br /><br />@ thecrackhead<br /><br />thanks, but I guess it&#039;s just some kind of love. Maybe a perverse form, don&#039;t know. I love her and I&#039;ve heard her bones break. Heard, literally.<br />I trust her decisions and want to do what I can to fulfill her desires.<br />But I Do really appreciate your words, Thanks, Thanks for trusting us! <br /><br />Heroin is Rare here, although we live in one of the biggest italian cities and one of the most famous metropolis in the world.<br />There&#039;s weed everywhere and coke everywhere, but no opiates, specially no heroin.<br /><br />ps. sorry for I maybe went a bit off-topic.<br />
