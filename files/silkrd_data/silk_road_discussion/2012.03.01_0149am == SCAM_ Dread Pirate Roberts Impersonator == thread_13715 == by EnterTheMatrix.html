				Hey Sellers,<br /><br />Watch out as there is a person impersonating our great leader, Dread Pirate Roberts. <br /><br />They are asking for 15BTC to join a new &quot;Private SR Market Place&quot; - The username is bullshit and just read the message, it&#039;s laughable!<br /><br />I just received this via the SR Messaging System:<br /><br />DreadPirateRoberts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Message From Your Captain.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Ahoy! This is your Captain speaking.<br /><br />We are happy to announce we are starting another brand new site called The Privateer. It will be an invite only sales site We will invite the high ranking, trusted sellers. You will have invites to be able to invite your trusted buyers. This is a secret site, not all buyers or sellers will know about it.<br /><br />We have chose to take this direction by listening to your feedback on the forum, It will eliminate scammers and leave buyers and sellers relative safety. We also think it will be safer to trade larger amounts. For the time being we will also charge no fees on this site at all.<br /><br />The site will go live on Monday 6th March, From now until then we will be inviting sellers to join for a small fee of 15btc after the 6th March deadline the price will be the same as the main Silk Road site. You are in the select few we are offering this discount too.<br /><br />The Privateer will be run on the same codebase that runs Silk Road, with all of the same features you know and love. However, it is run completely independently with it&#039;s own servers, Bitcoin wallets, databases, etc. If it becomes popular, we&#039;ll even look into putting it under separate management.<br /><br />You can send the joining fee directly to the new site by using the withdraw to address fuction in account to The Privateer address below or by sending to directly.<br />The Privateer Address: 1PB5P4eXJPnqsVfH2T9jU6srQ7q8DgB8v3<br /><br />If you choose to take this offer your Silk Road user name, password and pin will be unchanged on The Privateer and will be copied over from the main site for ease of use. This will happen when the site goes live on Monday 6th March you will then be free to change them if you wish.<br /><br />Again I must ask please keep this quiet until the site goes live, This is for the select few.<br /><br />We hope to welcome you aboard The Privateer<br /><br />Your Captain,<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJPSt5DAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olO9IH/jIH9+bqUjakcOSbbOxqKe7g<br />lGBQwpNdTVcvyi/5/EX7Y6DtJs3sR5OhQpXoeQHI+aGvNoF+iUrot0TiYmiTDa72<br />cBI3AD9TaxrbLuuuKhNuXTQ3BhoZMKx8VLdLK6HallllTW9Qwn5Fp2lr54tOV29a<br />BQXvhqfibg7+BZRM38yZJT/GFw2+FCjxMnp3o6oD/nXDrYDqtRJjfuas4Yad3JkB<br />owsH3+mZO014//UuLawUqJ/EKU7GA1xZ+YXy2fgn6U+hHNH9STLGXj3klHKgN8QV<br />KsoP/fxpiGeZyUprkVUarCs1LtSNHBsbiz+MzsaTYltVwSagZId+3X33n7AH2Mo=<br />=+nt5<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />Enjoy the ride,<br /><br />Matrix&nbsp; 8)

				Yea, I clocked that it was an impersonator also.<br /><br />I think everyone should bulk sent a message to everyone they know, and post a thread in each forum immediately. I&#039;m going to bulk send a message immediately.<br /><br />Time is key, so do it ASAP!<br /><br />Best regards, and hoping you weren&#039;t scammed,<br />Larghetto

				I basically dont know how to check the PGP signatures so I took the entire thing and sent it to SR support. They kindly notified to me that this was indeed a scam. To me the red flags went up because of the lack of spaces in the name and it is always nice to double check when it has money involved.<br /><br />I had to say it was clever.

				TO USD: It doesn&#039;t take much to be a good vendor here, just fill your orders timely, and make sure that people can&#039;t tell what&#039;s inside when it&#039;s going into the postal system/shipping. I have a 99% on 65 transactions by just not procrastinating and selling good product.
