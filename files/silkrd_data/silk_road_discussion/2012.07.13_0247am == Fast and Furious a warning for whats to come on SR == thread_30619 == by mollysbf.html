				Another paranoid post from me. Does anyone think that SR could be a similar project to the &quot;fast and furious&quot; scandal that happened earlier this year. This was also the first think Obama decided to use his executive order on. For all those who don&#039;t know it was an operation where a special new department the gov came up with sold THOUSANDS of fully automatic weapons to known mexican drug cartels in an effort to track those weapons and stop the war on drugs? I was thinking that SR just seems to good to be true and after all the bs lying the U.S. has done to it&#039;s citizens with the OKC bombing, 9/11, and the &quot;fast and furious&quot; incident (just to name a few) I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if our gov is actually many of the sellers on SR that have been here since the beginning or they have a way of watching everything and knowing who everyone is since just like the clearnet the gov invinted the darkweb for thier own uses before it fell into the publics hands. <br /><br />I know I sound like a paranoid paul but I know that if they decided to do one massive crackdown on all the buyers that have been making massive buys or to somehow bust all the vendors that also have buyer accounts it would be extremely easy to feed the story to the public without anyone asking a question as to how the gov could bust so many people at once on an anonymous market. They just throw in a couple confusing computer terms and it&#039;s all done and no one would ask questions.<br /><br />Just saying

				Yeah look how well the US government did with Fast and Furious&nbsp; ;) . For anyone unfamiliar with Fast and Furious- it was a gun-running operation by the US federal government to sell and track weapons to the cartels, with the hopes of busting the cartel leadership. If you think this sounds like a terribly stupid idea, you&#039;re right. Some of the guns were used to kill a US Border Patrol agent, and now the US Attorney General is being held on contempt charges in a scandal that is blowing up into Watergate proportions. <br /><br />Fast and Furious is vastly considered a huge failure, and is extremely unpopular with most American citizens. If&nbsp; a similar program was attempted with drugs, it would likely result in a huge uproar against the government. As far as the government trying to suppress it, so the truth wouldn&#039;t come out? All we&#039;d have to do is contact the media. There are laws that allow media outlets to keep their sources confidential, in fact, the New York Times even worked with Wikileaks to publish some of the leaked military cables. <br /><br />Even if the government did try to set up a seller account to bust potential buyers, the best they would be able to charge them with is likely &#039;Possession.&#039;&nbsp; If the government didn&#039;t send out the drugs that were purchased, then it&#039;d be pretty hard to get a possession charge to hold up in court, without the defendant possessing any drugs. In this scenario, an entrapment defense could likely also be used, basically saying that the government lured you into buying drugs that you wouldn&#039;t normally have bought. It would then be the government&#039;s responsibility to prove you wrong, since you&#039;re innocent until proven guilty. <br /><br />Basically, as much as the government hates it, I think we&#039;re safe&nbsp; ;D

				I would like to think we are safe but the only reason I think it is likely is because this is all anonymous....who knows whos behind it all. the government wouldn&#039;t have to ever say it was them behind it, they could simply say that they figured out how to crack it or some bs. know what I am saying? Idk I think about it alot....I could see the government having taken hold of certain vendor accounts once busted while issuing a gag order on the guilty ones. I know there are a few sr busts that make the news but I think it&#039;s very likely those were accidental busts made by local LEO rather than the busts made by higher up agencies that don&#039;t let the press get ahold of the info. Like I said I am a paranoid person who thinks about shit way to much but I think it is very likely. If the government is stupid enough to do 9/11 and fast and furious there is no telling what they will do. The american people refuse to believe their gov would do this shit so they just sweep everyone under the rug who makes a fuss. Fast and furious has not gotten near enough publicity and 9/11 don&#039;t even get me started on the OVERWHELMING proof that there was some sort of cover up at least if not us behind it all and using it as reason to go to war. Just like we did with ww1 ww2 and vietnam.

				Hello Sir, would you like to buy some Cannabis? <br /><br />No, I&#039;m quite busy at the moment. <br /><br />Come on, the product is quite good. <br /><br />I said no. <br /><br />Just try some, it&#039;s good for you. <br /><br />If I buy some will you leave me alone? <br /><br />Of course. <br /><br />...<br /><br />Your under arrest for the possession of a controlled substance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Your story reminded me of something similar to this.

				I am not here to convince anyone just spread the my ramblings to see if anyone else thought it was at least a reasonable paranoid idea. I am convinced the media can make events never happen by not reporting them. Sure world trade building 7 suffered a total structural collapse without being damaged by a plane or explosion but 95% of americans won&#039;t even believe you if you tell them this simply because the news didn&#039;t talk about it and the fact that it fell on its &quot;own&quot; is enough evidence to convince most people that there was at least someone else behind this thing other than some middle easterners on a Boing. I am just saying that americans aren&#039;t far from the nazis when it comes tho the fact that they think they are doing the right thing as long as their government says it&#039;s good. Hopefully someday a country will put us in our place like we all did to the nazis in wwII and make us take a step back when it&#039;s all over and we can realize what horrible people we are for all the horrible things we not only let our leaders do but encouraged them.<br /><br />My rants done, think about what I said or just right it off.

				&quot;Fast and Furious&quot; is a bullshit pander to the gun nut crowd created by Issa and Fox News. Even Forbes (hardly a left leaning magazine) said it did not happen. President Obama has sadly done nothing when it comes to gun laws.<br /><br />Have things like &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; happened on a lesser scale? Sure. There were two incidents during the Bush years where members of cartels were given arms and somehow were lost track off. Was it intentional? doubtful. The Forbes report points out that the Obama administration did not intentionally allow arms to be walked off with.<br /><br />http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2012/06/27/fast-and-furious-truth/<br /><br />Obviously, the biggest problem is the fact that Joe Schmo can go buy an AK and then sell it to a cartel member. That is the issue. Not some big government conspiracy. Gun laws are simply terrible in the US. <br /><br />Also, the United States has armed plenty of questionable groups, our own guns are being fired at us in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Remember all the people screaming that the President was going to take away their guns the day after he took the oath of office? Never happened. Do you really believe that our President has somehow concocted some scheme to allow him to enact gun control? Especially in the middle of an election year?<br /><br />Not saying that SR is totally safe, but to sit and compare some goofy BS coming out of the nutball tea party house and somehow expand it to a tor site seems to be very alarmist. Look up who is pushing this stuff.

If the government did try to trick someone you would fall victim immediately. Its simple to take advantage of a crazy person such as yourself.

				The supposed &quot;fast and furious&quot; &quot;scandal&quot; is made up nonsense by Faux Newz and the right wing. its conspiracy nonsense with no basis in reality. DO NOT worry about it. <br /><br />Rachel Maddow did a good piece about the wacko F&amp;F conspiracy theory. Watch the segment from a couple weeks ago. The F&amp;F thing is completely bogus.

				I wouldn&#039;t go so far as to say this is one big sting operation or setup by the government. But I would think that there&#039;s got to be some ratfink narc scumbag LEOs on SR, right? Of course there are or they wouldn&#039;t be doing their job of making life miserable for the unlucky people they c̶a̶t̶c̶h̶ assault. <br /><br />So, assuming that is true, the worries that will plague me are: how many LEOs are here? What&#039;s their strategy? Will they simply go after the servers (btw, is it known where the SR servers are? I don&#039;t know how this is set up). Or will they in fact play the narc game and just go after any random seller or buyer they can, picking us off one at a time until it scares people away? Surely by now, the DEA has setup a dedicated team and a mission title and all that, like &quot;Operation: Hippie Hunt&quot;.<br /><br />So yeah, I&#039;m not a conspiracy theorist. I&#039;m just worried about the practical things. I just hope this thing survives for the long haul. And I hate to be Debbie Downer, but I&#039;ll be amazed if SR as we know it today will be here 12 months or less from now. I&#039;m not basing that time frame on anything, just guessing. I&#039;m not religious, but I will be praying every night that SR survives and that it&#039;s community remains safe and out of harm&#039;s way for a long time to come.<br /><br />Is there a contingency plan for if/when the shit hits the fan and the site goes down? I would love it so much if when that ever does happen, there is a Bruce Wayne type of guy who is supporting SR behind the scenes with a lot of money and a lot of resources to do some tricks and bring SR right back online if it goes off - like Whack-a-Mole.<br />

Dunno what to say other than if you feel uncomfortable/insecure you can leave SR anytime you want. Yes, if the FBI or any other agency bust the site, they will be fucked. They will have been funding crime/drugs/weapons and such themselves out of tax payer`s money. It would be big news and would definitely be ridiculed by many in the public. This sort of thing has happened before.

				Was just trying to have a discussion that involved facts and opinions. Don&#039;t know where some of you get off thinking I am the one stealing air. I base my beliefs on facts and not just delusion. It wasn&#039;t meant to be an argument or history discussion. I was just saying that I think our government is definitely crooked enough to let something like this go on until they figured out how they could make the most money off of it before destroying. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if some sellers are the gov. unloading drugs themselves. Oh, and I wasn&#039;t comparing our president to hitler or saying that the persecution of the jews had nothing to do with WWII. Just saying most people blindly follow our government and stand behind them no matter what and until people open their eyes a little and start to ask some questions and hold the government and their financers accountable there is no telling what crazy shit our government will end up doing.

Even if there were dramatic changes in online privacy law and the like, SR wouldn&#039;t be a good place for a sting operation similar to &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; because of the legal hassle it would be to prosecute every motherfucker on here. The law is at best ambiguous when it comes to illegal activity online unless it&#039;s something really fucked up (CP, harassment, torture vids, etc).<br /><br />I do think that some sellers on this site are profiting from confiscated products but that&#039;s only a problem for them and a benefit for me. I think OP can rest easy knowing that if a big bust were to happen, someone on the forums would call out red flags/overly suspicious shit. It&#039;s even better if you&#039;re a buyer because the pigs tend to go for the big fish (aka sellers) first. OVBD is a good example of that.

Many of you in this generation never had to go and buy weed on the corner or in a slot in a door or&nbsp; at a known drug location.&nbsp; &nbsp;Drugs have been and always will be sold.

You realize how much it costs to put weed users behind bars? The average arrest I believe they say involves at minimum 4 officers consuming nearly 20 man hours, and that&#039;s just the arrest. Then you have court dates, possible jail time, the whole thing is a tragic waste of money.

				I can&#039;t believe some people think the notion that our government or another countries would turn around and anonymously sell the drugs back to users after they have made large busts. The whole war on drugs is so far from rationale I just don&#039;t see how the idea is completely impossible. I am not saying I 100% believe this idea I just figured I would see if anyone else thought it was probable. BTW I have been doing this IRL for a VERY long time and I don&#039;t abuse anything besides weed and have seen every south park episode a couple times. This website has by far made me more paranoid than any dealings IRL, even having guns pulled on me. Sorry for &quot;spreading propaganda&quot; but it&#039;s a fucking discussion forum so why don&#039;t u just discuss it rather than constantly insult each other which is what makes it seem like just propaganda.<br />
