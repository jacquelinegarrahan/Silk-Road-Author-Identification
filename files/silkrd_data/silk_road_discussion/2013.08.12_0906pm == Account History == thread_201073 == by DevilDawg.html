The only way is if you start over, which is really no different than clearing your history.

				i would like to see specific orders disappear after a while and still show the amount purchased. <br /><br />it still would give a vendor the advantage of seeing that the buyer has experince, but, in case the acc gets compromised and linked to a person, its harder to make a case, since theoretically legal items could have been purchased.<br /><br />

				&quot;Don&#039;t get hacked&quot; is the answer you&#039;re looking for. <br /><br />1. If your SR password isn&#039;t unique to SR and doesn&#039;t look something like &quot;3^pzXLXsniLu72v#7HLKRs&quot;, then you&#039;re doing it wrong.<br />2. If you don&#039;t have &quot;silkroad&quot;, &quot;vb5&quot;, and &quot;piz3r&quot; memorized, then you&#039;re doing it wrong.<br />3. If anyone else has your SR password and/or PIN, then you *might* be doing it wrong.<br />4. If you&#039;re a vendor and you&#039;re using the Tor Browser Bundle on your personal computer (instead of e.g. Tails), then you&#039;re doing it wrong.<br /><br />Off the top of my head. I&#039;m sure there are many around here that would have much more to add to this.

				perhaps in the future we can get another password that gives us access to detailed account info whereas the original password gets us access to marketplace and some of our personal account history but nothing TOO detailed.

				Only the last 30 days of account activity is displayable. If you&#039;re really that paranoid, make it a rule that you will only accept orders that use PGP in the address field. State that you will cancel any and all orders that do not use PGP. <br /><br />You can even enforce PGP use for all communications. This way, if SR was ever infiltrated, while the infiltrator would see what was ordered, they couldn&#039;t see to whom the orders were about to be sent to since that information would be PGP encrypted. <br /><br />Another thing is that SR doesn&#039;t display what BTC address coin was sent to but they do have that information internally. So use an external tumbler or an intermediary of some sort to add plausible deniability to the coins you withdraw. <br /><br />You really don&#039;t have that much to be paranoid over. LEO needs to know who you really are. You take diligent measures to conceal your true identity. Think deep about what might reveal who and where you are. Then take steps to misdirect and conceal that. <br />&nbsp;
