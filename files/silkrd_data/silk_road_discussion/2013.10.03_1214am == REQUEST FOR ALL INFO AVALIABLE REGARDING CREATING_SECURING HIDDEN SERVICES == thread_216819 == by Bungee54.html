				I didn&#039;t think much about hidden services, but those things come to mind:<br /><br />* Use server in a country which is unwilling to cooperate with the USA, e.g. China<br />Simply tunnel the Tor connection through various VPN&#039;s to get beyond the Golden Shield firewall<br />China would probably love a little payback for the opium wars during which China got humiliated by the Anglos. It just needs to be hidden well, so they can say they didn&#039;t know anything about it. Contacting Chinese patriotic hackers may be helpful.<br /><br />* Use a dedicated server with virtual machines, so the hidden service is isolated from the internet and can only connect to another virtual machine, thus once it gets hacked it&#039;s still necessary to break out of the virtual machine to get the server IP<br /><br />Best option would be a decentralized service similar to Bittorrent. Some kind of Silk Road cloud which everyone can set up. Just run a hidden service, install the SR cloud and done. Something like it was in the making in 2011 on OVDB, but the project got abandoned when it became clear that the Silk Road would have a darknet marketplace monopoly.<br /><br />A far fetched option would be to launch a Silk Road satelite into orbit. Satelites can be produced quite cheaply, and launching them into orbit may become affordable too. To take them down the USA would have to use space weapons, which would cause an outrage by Russia and China.

				hello bungee, not sure if this is what you ask for but it could help you greatly! Google what is steganography. It is a science technique of how to encrypt text into images/sounds. It is awesome and ultra simple, yet effective because everybody sends/receives pictures all the time, and not only by the email.<br /><br />also, one small question, how should I contact you on the other marketplaces so that you know it&#039;s me? I think you may remember me from SR (under different nick) and I&#039;d like to not lose you and my (small but still) reputation with you (had some good interaction with you).

				I think that&#039;s exactly the discussion we now need to go forward.<br /><br />I think it would be a good idea to develop an open-source anonymous trading platform so everyone can review the code for backdoors and security. This project would need a lot of review and coding time being spent on before used in the public but the benefits can help us. It would make it possible to move on very quickly if one trading platform gets busted and decentralize us but keep some trust there. I don&#039;t know if I can trust sites like BMR and SM in terms of security.

				I can give you info about the security, but not the technical side of the security. The human nature side of the security.<br /><br />If anyone want to revive the famous Silk Road to operate again, he will take a really hard work on his back, and he need to have a LOT of knowledge. Why ? Because this operation can be done only by one man. It is this simple, this job is a ONE man job. If you are thinking about making the site operating with a team, the same will happen with you as well.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t create a site alone, if you can&#039;t set up the security alone, if you don&#039;t have the necessary knowledge how to remain hidden, how to deal with difficulties, PLEASE don&#039;t event start thinking to revive Silk Road.<br /><br />We need a man, who has no job, no family, who can work on this project day and night, deal with the problems, and manage it all alone.<br />This is a hard work, but there is a plenty of help on the internet, where you can learn about the technical accomplishments.<br /><br />To create a site like Silk Road is not hard at all. The maintenance of the site is hard. <br /><br />If you want to make it, all you have to do is get an anonymous VPN, install a virtual machine on it, start a hidden service, build the site, publish it. You need basic PHP skills, some database (mysql, mssql whatever) skills, the bitcoin integration. But all this skills can be acquired from the internet or from forums.<br /><br />When you have this all, you have to verify the sellers identity to make sure the same seller is selling on your site, as he did on the Silk Road. You can do this with PGP sign, its not hard. Don&#039;t let anyone sell at first, only who can verify himself.<br /><br />Now comes the support part, when there are some problems between the buyers and sellers, which is your job to decide in this cases. Even if there are way too many cases, you have to do it. You can&#039;t rely on anyone on the earth, not even your real life friends, not your family, no one.<br /><br />You can have some trusted helpers besides you, who can help you notify about things, but they can&#039;t have more rights on the site than a simple user. All the data, the info must be yours and only yours.<br /><br />If you can keep yourself to this simple rules, you can succeed to revive the Silk Road, but you need to be very confident about what are you going to make, and I think 1 from 100.000 is able to do it.<br /><br />I have no any reputation on this site, and nor in the forum, as I wasn&#039;t an active part of this community, but I am sure I would be one of the guy who could do it, but I will not, as my circumstances doesn&#039;t allow me to do.<br /><br />If you feel like you can achieve it, start your plan today, tell no one, accomplish it, and when you are done announce it, if you follow my rules, you will not fail, but remember, it will be like &#039;having sex with the pretties 5 top model in the world, and you could tell no one&#039;.<br /><br />Good luck my anonymous friend.
