				I am still missing almost 200BTC and still havent heard anything from Silk Road. I read somewhere on here that some people&#039;s bitcoins are showing up, but I wouldn&#039;t send them yet if I were you.

				I transfered 45btc to my account yesterday and it worked fine.&nbsp; As long as you use the new transfer address in your account you should be fine.

				I transferred them last night late, to the bold address listed on my account. the address has changed on my account page, but my balance is still 0.&nbsp; I would wait until Silk posts a signed message stating that their deposit issues are solved before sending anything! I am just sick that I might have lost $600

				i have the exact same problems but my transaction was through canadian virtual exchange.&nbsp; I&#039;m beginning to think that this bitcoin and silkroad is one big clever scam.&nbsp; I have at this time not yet been able to purchase anything.&nbsp; Here is my experience so far.&nbsp; Downloaded Tor, entered silkroad, searched for a product, contact a seller, deposit bitcoins through escrow, wait for seller to deliver goods, good not deliver because seller was a scammer, bitcoins returned but only half of what I started with because the bitcoin value dropped 50%, found a new seller, purchased more bitcoins which takes freaking two days for the full transaction to go through,&nbsp; seller prices increase because the value of the bitcoin falls further, wtf!, short on bitcoins, buy more bitcoins, wait two days for bitcoins to be deposited into silkroad wallet, guess what! seller product rises in costs due to the falling value of bitcoins again!, buy more bitcoins and had them deposited into my silkroad account, but this time the bitcoin deposit is missing!!!&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Paying with bitcoins is like paying in stocks. It can be a wild ride from day to day. At least it&#039;s recovered a bit. I read that you should never hold onto btc for long. Buy what you need and spend them all quickly.<br /><br />I use MoneyPak exchanges. They charge 5%-10% but you can get btc in minutes instead of days. I heard they don&#039;t sell them in Canada yet. <br /><br />Of course the site has to be working to receive the btc the same as any other exchange. I hope everyone eventually gets their funds, but it might take a few days to sort everything out. I believe they can figure out the correct sender and receiver using btc data.

				Made a transfer of BTC funds to my SR account at around 10:30am.<br /><br />Around 12:05 pm the funds showed up.&nbsp; &nbsp;So that&#039;s around 1.5 hour, not bad.<br /><br />The same happened to me in my previous transactions last month.

				No there are no moneypaks in Canada.&nbsp; Bummer because they do seem pretty handy for fast cash.

				cavirex (Canadian Virtual Exchange).<br /><br />All btc fund transfers from my cavirex account to my Silk Road account took no more than 2 hours.<br /><br />Is there anything better than this?

				Cavirex is great.&nbsp; You can even do cash deposits to them at RBC and CIBC branches without ID.
