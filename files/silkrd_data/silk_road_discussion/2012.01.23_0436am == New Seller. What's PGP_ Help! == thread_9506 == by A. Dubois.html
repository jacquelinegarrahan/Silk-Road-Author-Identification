				Hello all- I have decided to become a seller here on SR. I haven&#039;t even purchased my seller account yet, since I don&#039;t get my scrips till the middle of next month (Feb), but I&#039;m trying to learn all I can until then. What is PGP and how do you use it to send msgs? Keep in mind I&#039;m on a mac. I&#039;m tired of dealing with broke begging losers so I&#039;m hoping to reduce risk and make more scratch doing things this way. The last thing I need is another pinch. What is the best way to gain trust when I first open my seller account? It would suck if I just sat there with no orders because I have no feedback. I am a full on agorist/libertarian anarchist so this is a dream come true. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!!

				I created my tormail acct and installed T Bird, now I just need to get the two communicating. I did everything to the letter on the tormail &quot;help&quot; tab and T Bird is giving me an error msg. It&#039;s asking if my usrnm and pswrd are correct. I ran through the whole process 3 times and even tried the &quot;failure to auto config&quot; proxy settings on the tor help tab. I&#039;m at a loss now. Getting tired so I&#039;ll try again tomorrow. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for getting me this far, anyway! :(

Download and Install Thunderbird.<br />2. Open Thunderbird.<br />3. Goto Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced Icon -&gt; General Tab<br />4. Click Config Editor button.<br />5. In the config editor filter type in network.proxy.socks_remote_dns<br />6. Double click on it to change the value to True. (See Image #1 below)<br />7. Close the Config Editor and click &quot;Network &amp; Disk Space&quot; tab.<br />8. Click Settings Button.<br />9. Select Manual Proxy Configuration and fill in the following. (See Image #2 below)<br />HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1 Port 8118<br />SSL Proxy: 127.0.0.1 Port 8118<br />Socks Proxy: 127.0.0.1 Port 9050<br />10. Select Socks 4.<br />11. Press OK.<br />12. Press OK again on the options window to close it.<br /><br /><br />- i imagine the proxy / socks are specific to your connection, check these in aurora / adv / network / socks settings., or in the vidalia message log...<br />

				I looked up these socks/proxy settings in the menu you described, and they are different than the ones the instructions say to add. In the aurora advanced etc menu the first two proxy numbers are blank and the socks proxy has 54745 as the port numbers. Should I add these numbers from aurora into the T Bird settings, instead of the ones the instructions say to add? Or even better, is there a way to use PGP without this T Bird thing at all? It&#039;s important to note I have NO IDEA what any of this stuff really means. I&#039;m just parroting the instructions. I am concerned about adding new proxy numbers when I have no idea how to fix it if something goes wrong. BIG THANKS for all the help, tho. You got me almost there!

				- the 9050 in the thunderbird example are just an example...it assumes the port is 9050, enter 54745 in the thunderbird socks port No for your situation.<br />&nbsp; (sorry i don&#039;t use thunderbird to tormail...i have a simpler setup and use more commandline Linux..perhaps i&#039;ll attempt to setup this pop3/smtp thunderbird ..)<br /><br />- you will have to change the socks port each time you connect as the port randomises on each connection / each use of Tor when you open...work...exit <br />&nbsp; the Tor / vidalia bundle..<br /><br />- can use pgp (GnuPG) w/o this thunderbird / tormail, but you&#039;d have to do the encryption and decryption steps manually, easy-ish if you&#039;ve it done it a couple of times...<br />&nbsp; you&#039;ll need the gpg / pgp apps installed to help with the steps, still means selecting text to encrypt...specifiying recipients..copying the encrypted text message and<br />&nbsp; pasting it into an email in tormail....and send, the reverse steps for decrypting....<br /><br /><br />- i have tried to get the Tor (vidalia) bundle to use&nbsp; fixed port No but didnt seem to work ...this was a few versions ago and so gave up and now check the socks port<br />&nbsp; manually and change where i&#039;m using socks.....thunderbird in your case etc...<br />

				I have the PGP tools download but I haven&#039;t tried to use it yet. It does have some instructions so I&#039;ll run through those. I don&#039;t expect to be sending and receiving a boatload of msgs so I don&#039;t mind doing it manually. My main concern is doing it securely. Hey man I want to tell you BIG THANKS. I wouldn&#039;t be anywhere without those links you hit me with. That was really great. THANK YOU!!! When I send my first msgs I&#039;ll swing back through and give you a rundown and ask if it seems like I&#039;m doing it securely.

				Grabbed Symantec&#039;s PGP Desk top (Mac) which allows you to copy your message to a clipboard, encrypt, and then paste to any email.&nbsp; Bit of a learning curve and its not free, unless you pirate it.&nbsp; Yarrgh.
