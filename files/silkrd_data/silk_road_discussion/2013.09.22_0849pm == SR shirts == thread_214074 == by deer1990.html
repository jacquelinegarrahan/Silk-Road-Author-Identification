				Yea i saw those t shirts for sale not sure what to make of it.<br /><br />Same thing with me i have people talk to me about SR and i pretend i don&#039;t know what it is or never heard of it. Something along the lines of &#039;oh i heard of it isnt it like an ebay for drugs?&#039;<br /><br />As if your gonna let on about this and lose your advantage.

				Yeah ... I agree in the most fundamental of ways. <br />Do not talk about Fight Club.<br /><br />Yet..&nbsp; .. Have you seen how many kids wear Hell&#039;s Angel T-shirts?? In a way, if people start wearing t-shirts about SR then this almost &#039;proves&#039; how far we&#039;ve come. I&#039;d bet that some kid wearing the t-shirt probably doesn&#039;t have any idea what SR is. Its almost like SR has broken ground that can&#039;t be stopped. This is good. Although, it may also throw the gauntlet down for LE - as in bust us now or forever remain silent. I dunno.

				Long time before I saw a vendor selling a SR shirt I searched for a HQ picture of the SR camel to make myself a T-Shirt. It would be very cool. Imagine going to your dentist with it or something like that. ;D<br />Of course it&#039;s insane, but I would love to see the possible reactions to it when people are actually understanding.

				No fucks given here.<br /><br />Hand me a shirt and I&#039;ll wear it and stand behind a news reporter for the world to see, waving my hands like a tosser and all. I think the shirt is a great idea, just not for people that can&#039;t afford attention ie King pins.<br />&nbsp;<br />IMO if your worried about being caught for trafficking drugs because of a shirt your wearing, you need to rethink your strategy on receiving and storing drugs.&nbsp;

				Anyone who actually uses SR and is concerned about their personal security and liberty would not be wise to wear something that would bring attention to their own illegal activities. However, you guys are so concerned about your own security that you miss the bigger picture. There is a great movement that we have been a part of here and SR is reaching the status of cultural icon. This movement is bigger than you. It is bigger than DPR. It is bigger than SR. If DPR is gone, he can be replaced. If SR closes, It can be replaced. The very purpose of the creation of SR was to have an OPEN marketplace where everyone can safely come (including LE). Its very creation is an affront to LE. It is a challenge to LE. It is meant to flaunt our freedom in the face of the oppressors. Every punk kid who wears a SR t shirt perpetuates the flaunting of that freedom. And the longer it is flaunted and the wider the acceptance and even support of SR grows, the less power those oppressors have over the minds of the oppressed. And once the hundredth monkey no longer accepts the tyranny, the tyranny will fall.

				If a clearnet or storefront retailer was selling the shirts, it would be fine and a tremendous benefit to all of us here. The more we immerse the real world in to our culture, the safer we are, and the safer the TOR network is.<br /><br />But it is not safe until its mainstream.

				I saw someone walking down the street last year with a &quot;Dread pirate roberts&quot; t-shirt. I couldn&#039;t tell if he was a fan of the princess bride, or a SR advocate. I feel something like that would be a more subtle way to show your appreciation. Not that i&#039;m opposed to straight up SR shirts, but I wouldn&#039;t wear one.
