				This is not ment to kiss anyone&#039;s ass,just to spread some love to all the good people on here.<br /><br />with that said.<br />It makes me a little sad that every time SR have a minor issue there is always a bunch of people getting upset and taking &quot;our&quot; name in vein because they seem to believe SR is a service like VISA or Cable TV. its not.<br /><br />&quot;why the fuck doesnt it work!!!!11???++&quot;<br />&quot;im so fucking important,make it work for ME!! ME!! MEEEEE!!&quot;<br /><br />bitch please,If you take a step back and look at what silk-road really is you might see that if you want to,you could be a part of the revolutionary thing that it really is. at least try to appreciate it a little.<br />when you get old(er) you will be able to point at a page in a history book and say &quot;i was a part of that&quot; because SR is going in the books that is for sure.<br /><br />I have only been a member for 7 months but i have also been stabbed one to many times in my life buying drugs,and that will not happen again (knock on wood) thanks to the geniuses that makes this site possible.<br /><br />The vendors,staff and the wonderful people that makes this community so fucking awesome already gets all this and i might sound like a broken record to you but to those other people please just try to grasp what silk-road means for the world and try to not just see it as a place where drugs are available.<br /><br />i have so much love for this community,and i get a fuzzy feeling every time i log on to the main site and the forums,and don&#039;t forget the feeling of coming home from work and realize there is a professionally packed package containing my favorite drug just waiting for me to open . <br />if that is not the definition of awesome then please tell me what is?? <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;m the only one that have caught myself dancing and clapping wile opening a package or sniffing that great zero hash or taking the first lick trying to establish the quality of the molly i just bought&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I might not say it but the next time you make a well thought out post i will reed it with a smile on my lips,seeing people with the same mind-set helping each other out and being nice,everything the &quot;public&quot; and media would say is impossible between criminals of the law. <br /><br />i realize now that this is to much text for the people that this is aimed at so to all of you still reading I LOVE YOU and in my mind we are all bestest friends forever. <br /><br />Tons of powdered love from Sweden.

				Well put, SR has definitely been a game changer and for the tons of people that bitch every time there is a hi-cup, go elsewhere, I understand that it sucks but the growing pains are worth the end result.&nbsp; For vendors I know this would be alot more stressful but in the end,&nbsp; part of there profit is from taking advantage of this site.Having XBTC tied up does suck but it is part of the business. Most Vendors already state that the fees are included in the price for shipping and sellers fees that is why the prices are more than street but its the buyers that end up absorbing this fee.&nbsp; I would rather SR be down for a week then pop back up&nbsp; opposed to SR never coming back online. For Vendors it would be nice to see if SR was down for 24 hours there bitcoins would automatically head to there backup wallet.<br /><br />Silk Road has allowed me to obtain my drug of choice in a manner of low risk better understanding of what I am getting as there are forums to communicate with other buyers as to quality and stealth.&nbsp; I&nbsp; have had the chance to try some of the best hash from around the world.&nbsp; most of these are not available domestically as the profit margins are not what the local dealers want.&nbsp; I had a friend ask me the other day what&nbsp; my chuck of hash was worth and I honestly looked at him and said &quot; what does price have to do with quality&quot; I would rather spend a little more for top quality.<br /><br />&nbsp;I have hash that I smoke on a regular basis when friends drop by.<br /><br />I have hash&nbsp; for when me and my wife want to get blasted.<br /><br />I have hash that taste great and is great to smoke before going out for the day.<br /><br />DID&nbsp; I say just how much I love SR!<br />

				Couldn&#039;t agree more with both of you...<br /><br />... Why the fuck is it, that everyone thinks they are entitled to whatever the fuck they want now a days. It really fucking pisses me off, man.<br /><br />People moaning at DPR cause the sites gone down for an hour or two, what they need to understand is that this is fucking DPR&#039;s life - look what he is running, I mean really take a step back and look. <br /><br />An anonymous black market! I can have any substance in the world delivered to my door when ever I want, that is amazing. <br /><br />DPR probably works 24/7 as well, to keep us protected as well as himself so I would love to thank him for that.<br /><br />I know what it&#039;s like to be in that position, at 16 I started a business, and by 17 I was loaded, but I soon crashed and burned because I became a big spender and my business went down the pan because I was still a little boy.<br /><br />I started another business after, which failed from the start - and only now, with my third business am I truly happy, I love what I do, I don&#039;t even make a lot of money... yet, lol... but I am the happiest I&#039;ve ever been.<br /><br />Hell, even if DPR decided to go on vacation, I wouldn&#039;t be that bothered, people need to give the man/girl a fucking break.

				Louis C.k &quot;Cell Phones And Flying&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />He talks about how shitty this generation is,and how everything needs to be &quot;FUCKING PERFECT ALL THE TIME&quot; its so true its sad!<br /><br />Just change some words to silk-road and laugh your ass off. :D<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpUNA2nutbk<br /><br /><br />And to add how fucking awesome SR is,it is really REALLY&nbsp; hard to find good product here,unless you know some really shady people.<br />SR has given me the chance to try everything drug related on my bucket list,everything from weed to dmt and pretty much everything in between,good luck finding dmt in my town.<br />And its pretty safe if you put some effort in to it.<br /><br />Now me and my girl can without stress smoke some great product and have a laugh together.<br />(she did not complain about the speed+viagra combo while she was stoned out of her mind on a good sativa i can assure you that!! ;) <br />i think i have to redo the wallpaper before i move out,also the floor might have some water damage. ) but that&#039;s another story.<br /><br /><br />There is even a dude on here selling Fair trade hash! OOOOUGGGGH!! I think iÂ´m having a braingasm,shooting neuro-jizz in my girlfriends brainhole!!!! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
