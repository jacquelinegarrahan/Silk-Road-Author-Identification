				I have been purchasing weed from SR for a while now but i am really looking for a vendor within the UK who sells ounces at a decent price. I am willing to purchase from abroad if the success rate is high enough. I have seen one vendor who sells grams for almost £30!... Ridiculous money, regardless of how good the weed is. Can anyone recommend a good &quot;bulk&quot; weed vendor who supplies to the UK please? Cheers all.

				The only bulk deal I can think of is MrCronk&#039;s soap bar or maybe Sonicdrone&#039;s but the quality is really bad with Sonicdrone&#039;s soap bar. MrCronk&#039;s stuff is actually really good, I was surprised for sure. On the green front (the main front if you ask me) I have yet to come across a single outstanding deal for ounces of green but MrCronk does an outdoor haze that a few people have said is pretty good and I&#039;m sure you can grab that in fairly big quantities. I think for the bigger amounts you have to look abroad to someone like MrOuid who does really decent deals on the M39 (indica dominant) and his success rate to the UK is reportedly good as well. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be keeping my eye on this thread though, all I can get is Blue Cheese and Lemon Kush by me and while they are great strains to smoke you need a bit of variety.

				I did pm mrouid about his success rate to the UK and he said he doesn&#039;t ship anything over 2oz to the UK because too many are lost/seized. Even though I only want 1oz, I don&#039;t want to risk it to be honest. However, muskabuzz is offering some excellent bud for a good price and apparently delivery is guaranteed to US and North West Europe... I have pm&#039;d the vendor because he only deals with high rated buyer it seems. Fingers crossed I am allowed to place an order... I&#039;d become a regular for sure... stuff looks awesome.

I know he stopped proper bulk to the UK but it seems all the bulk has stopped to the UK. There is another vendor called Oliver who is also selling tidy amounts of M39. Also, as dude above said, MuskaBuzz has some prime fleetwood OG for sale in good quantities and he ships to the UK. There is hope yet!

				You should send a message to Wehkampf (formerly called LECKERMANN) <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/642134872c <br />I don&#039;t know why he had to set up a new vendor account but the feedback is as good as before. His standard deal is 5g of high quality skunk, priced between 4.3 and 6 BTC, but I&#039;ve read that people who purchase from the UK receive their package from him within 3 working days on average which is pretty good.<br /><br />I know he does custom orders for people and at those prices on the 5g I don&#039;t see why it should be anymore than the standard price of an ounce here in the UK.<br /><br />As an alternative there is a vendor called underground<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/acac0b24c9<br />He&#039;s selling &#039;grit&#039; which is supposed to be 90% amnesia and 10% of leaves. 25grams of that is 13.88 BTC around £120 at the time of writing but I know nothing of his product reviews or feedback.

				Wehkampf/Leckermann is the only vendor i really use for weed... always good quality and it always arrives (i have 10g on the way as well as the 1 oz from Muskabuzz)... i just want to start buying in larger quantities and preferably domestic. The 10g order from Wehkampf will be my personal smoke... the oz will be bagged and sold to make the money back and i&#039;ll smoke the rest.

				I totally forgot about St.Exo. Basically he&#039;s fairly big time IRL and is starting a growing operation to capitalise on the fact that most UK weed is overpriced.<br />There is an original forum post where he details his plan but it&#039;s pretty much 4 ounce minimum order at £130 per ounce. He even had a forum poll for users to vote on which strains he should grow first. Understandably people were willing to snap his hand off with that deal so I think the waiting list is now pretty big. You have to message him and receive what he terms a &#039;purchase invite&#039; where you are given the link to his vendor page.<br />See this forum post: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92363.msg650219#msg650219 for more up to date details.
