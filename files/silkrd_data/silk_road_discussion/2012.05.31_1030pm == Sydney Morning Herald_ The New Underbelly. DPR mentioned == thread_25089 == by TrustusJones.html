				I was just going to post the link but for obvious reason I will just post the article... <br /><br />It&#039;s called the Dark Web and once you are in you can buy people, drugs, guns and even have someone killed. The problem is: what can law enforcers do about it? <br />Deep in cyberspace is a web of private networks hosting sites that Google will never find and videos that YouTube will never play. Within this web, drugs and guns are bought and sold, hitmen advertise their services, hackers can be hired to attack an enemy&#039;s computer and pornographic images to satisfy the most depraved tastes can be downloaded.<br />It is a place where freedom of speech is absolute and unconstrained. It is the Dark Web, the parallel internet that can be found only through encrypted private networks, unknown by many and accessed by few.<br />Advertisement: Story continues below<br />The question being asked by law enforcement agencies is: how should they be regulated? Can they be regulated? The federal Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, has proposed legislative changes that could lead to the web history of any device connected to the internet being logged and retained for up to two years for law enforcement purposes.<br />&quot;We must stay one step ahead of terrorists and organised criminals who threaten our national security,&quot; Ms Roxon said last month.<br />But such measures will have no effect on those who conduct their criminal activities on the Dark Web because nothing is logged — there is no history to keep. And some argue such measures will cause more people to seek out anonymity services — the same services that provide access to the Dark Web.<br />&quot;The Dark Web is the new underbelly of the internet,&quot; says Ken Gamble, chairman of the Australian chapter of the International Association of Cyber Crime Prevention. &quot;It&#039;s seemingly uncontrollable, but of course there is a lot going on behind the scenes [by law enforcement agencies] that the public doesn&#039;t know about.&quot;<br />Drugs are the most common items for sale, but there are also online markets for weapons and explosives, false passports, entire new identities, counterfeit cash and fake diplomas. There are sites that claim to sell human organs that the buyer can collect from a Third World country and those that promise to procure exotic animals. Then there are the services; on offer are contract killings, hackers for hire, money laundering, theft-to-order, university papers and match-fixing.<br />Other sites offer porn that cannot be found on the regular internet — or &quot;clearnet&quot; in Dark Web speak. This includes child porn (prepubescent children), &quot;jailbait&quot; porn (young teens), zoophilia or bestiality and &quot;hurt porn&quot;,&#039; which shows children and adults being subjected to pain.<br />An Australian Federal Police spokesman said the ability to use technology to commit crime was a real threat. &quot;From a law enforcement perspective, this means we need to develop new methodologies to ensure perpetrators cannot hide behind technological advances.&quot;<br />&quot;Hidden services&quot; that enable people and organisations to host or access illegal material while their identity and location remains secret come bundled with anonymity software. Tor, originally developed in conjunction with the US Navy to protect government communications, is the most widely used, with more than 36 million downloads last year and between half a million and a million daily users.<br />&quot;We are pretty familiar with the Tor network, because a lot of the criminals use that,&quot; Gamble says.<br />Andrew Lewman, executive director of The Tor Project, says its positive applications outweigh the negative. &quot;Tor&#039;s original design was to give users privacy and anonymity online and that&#039;s still the core of what we do.<br />&quot;We produce software that we give away free [so that] anyone anywhere in the world who needs their privacy online can have it.&quot;<br />This includes whistleblowers (WikiLeaks recommends it for releasing sensitive information) and human rights workers in hostile regimes, but Lewman says the vast majority of Tor usage is by &quot;normal people who are just looking to not give out all their information: who they are, where they are and every website they visit&quot;.<br />Tor&#039;s hidden services began as a research project by US and Norwegian militaries to determine whether an anonymous platform could be developed to help people working in hostile regimes. If nobody, including Tor, knows who runs a website or where it is hosted, that information cannot be revealed. And if a server gets confiscated, there will be no IP trails or records of traffic to compromise operations. &quot;Of course, criminals will pick up on that too, but criminals are opportunistic. That&#039;s why they&#039;re criminals,&quot; Lewman says.<br />When the Tor software is downloaded, users have access to so-called &quot;onion sites&quot;. Because the sites are not designed to be found by search engines, users must either know the exact URL they want or use one of the available gateway sites.<br />The best known of the onion sites is the illegal drug marketplace Silk Road. Slick, professional and thriving with a multimillion-dollar turnover, Silk Road has set the standard for online black markets.<br />Its owner, known as Dread Pirate Roberts, claims to take a &quot;high moral ground&quot; when it comes to what it will sell; it refuses to list any items or services the intent of which is to defraud or cause harm to another person.<br />Black Market Reloaded (BMR), has no such pretences of conscience. Run on a similar platform to Silk Road, it sells not only drugs, but firearms and explosives, stolen Paypal accounts and credit card numbers, online banking account numbers and passwords, and contract killing services.<br />There are several offers of Australian bank account details for a percentage of the balance amount. The vendor offering Australian bank account details has good feedback for most transactions, but three claim the seller is a scammer.<br />Scammers and law enforcement are the main concerns of users of the black-market sites — in that order. Although buyers have the protection of an escrow and dispute resolution service on the larger sites, sellers sometimes persuade buyers to transact out of escrow. Or they plan a long con, as happened recently on Silk Road when the site&#039;s top-rated and most trusted seller of cocaine and heroin disappeared with an estimated $250,000 of Silk Road customers&#039; money.<br />Identity items are another high-demand black-market product. These range from $5 driving licence copies that are good for nightclub entry but not much else, to passports that are &quot;genuinely generated from within the IPS system of the UK government and guaranteed good for travel&quot; for $4000.<br />The black markets and services almost exclusively use the virtual online currency Bitcoin. An April 2012 report apparently by America&#039;s FBI (marked for official use only but leaked to the internet in early May) claims that the unique features of Bitcoin present distinct challenges for deterring illicit online activity.<br />While Bitcoin has legitimate uses, it is likely to continue to attract cyber criminals due to the ability to transact anonymously. &quot;Since Bitcoin does not have a centralised authority, law enforcement faces difficulties detecting suspicious activity, identifying users and obtaining transaction records,&quot; the report says. It estimates the Bitcoin economy to be worth between $35 million and $40 million.<br />Some Dark Web sites seem to be a form of dark parody or perhaps the demented fantasies of a disturbed mind. &quot;Choosing the best girl&quot; offers tips about the type of female a cannibal should target, depending on how they want to cook their prey, and &quot;The Human Experiment&quot; claims to detail illegal laboratory experiments conducted on homeless people.<br />Other sites are incomprehensible to mere mortals — these are the hangouts of the hackers and phreakers (people who study, explore or experiment with telecommunications systems and who often work with hackers) doing whatever it is they do in their own impenetrable language.<br />But it is a cost of having a completely free anonymous web that the most unpalatable also get an equal voice. The most persistently disturbing aspect of the Dark Web is the child porn services. The Dark Web allows offenders to chat openly in online forums, download under-age porn and swap images without fear of identification or censorship.<br />Freenet.org, a smaller anonymity provider than Tor, but one that is known for its population of child abuse sites, says: &quot;The true test of someone who claims to believe in freedom of speech is whether they tolerate speech which they disagree with or even find disgusting.&quot;<br />Seeing chat rooms in which offenders graphically describe sex acts with prepubescent children in the same terms you might expect to hear about adult porn stars is certainly disturbing.<br />Dr William Glaser, a psychiatrist who specialises in the assessment and treatment of sex offenders, says: &quot;Offenders who only use child porn without going on to assault children seem to have a higher level of deviant sexual fantasies and an increased tendency to hold distorted views of children as sexual beings, compared to those offenders who actually assault kids.&quot; But he concedes it might be possible that, for some, contact with other offenders over the internet could help to normalise and validate their experiences.<br />Even in the underground world of the Dark Web, most participants consider this stuff unacceptable. Dark markets that allow under-age porn to be listed for sale soon find their customers boycotting their shops.<br />Members of vigilante hacktivist collective Anonymous continually attempt to frustrate child abuse sites by crashing their hosts&#039; servers and those of sites they believe to be supportive of child porn.<br />Last October members of the group launched &quot;Operation Darknet&quot;, crashing the server of the host of the largest collection of child pornography on the internet and using a form of trickery to expose a list of IP addresses they claimed had accessed child porn site &quot;Lolita City&quot;.<br />&quot;We will continue to not only crash Freedom Hosting&#039;s server, but any other server we find to contain, promote, or support child pornography,&quot; Anonymous said.<br />But the successes of Anonymous have amounted to little more than a slight inconvenience to their targets; servers are restored within hours, if not minutes, the owners and whereabouts of the child abuse sites remain secret and images continue to be downloaded.<br />The Hidden Wiki, a gateway site that provides links to many Dark Web sites, including child porn, carries the message: &quot;To Anonymous: [this site] is simply a wiki. Anti-paedo? Attack the paedo sites. You didn&#039;t attack Wikipedia for hosting information about your enemies. Wake up.&quot;<br />Ken Gamble believes Tor and other anonymity providers need to take responsibility for the content they enable. &quot;Any organisation or infrastructure that operates as part of the global internet machine needs to take accountability,&quot; he says.<br />Andrew Lewman disagrees. &quot;We don&#039;t host the content and therefore have no control over it. Would he expect Ford or Toyota to &#039;take responsibility&#039; for those who steal, kidnap, speed, and otherwise break laws with their automobiles?&quot;<br />Most of Tor&#039;s funding comes from the US government, non-profit organisations and research programs. Around 5 per cent of its funding comes from donations, including anonymous donations. Some Dark Web sites claim to anonymously direct a percentage of their profits to Tor and encourage their customers to do the same. However, Tor does not accept Bitcoin donations, directing them instead to an unrelated entity, torservers.net for &quot;a faster, larger Tor Network&quot;.<br />Lewman says Tor has turned down sizeable donations from organisations known or suspected to be involved with terrorism or organised crime. But its acceptance of anonymous donations means it is reasonable to assume that part of Tor&#039;s funding may come from the criminals who have a vested interest in the work carried out in conjunction with some of the world&#039;s top university research departments. &quot;It concerns us, yes,&quot; Lewman says.<br />But no matter how advanced the technology, users can never have 100 per cent guaranteed anonymity. &quot;As a research project, we&#039;re far more honest than others about this,&quot; Lewman says. &quot;We do not magically encrypt the internet. Anyone who says they do is lying.&quot;<br />But he says it is operator rather than software error — users log into a site that knows their identity or publish information that inadvertently identifies them. &quot;Tor will protect your traffic over the network — what you do with that is up to you.&quot;<br />One thing Gamble and Lewman agree on is that old-fashioned police work is still the most effective way to catch those who would use the Dark Web for illegal activities. And the Australian Federal Police has this warning for anyone contemplating online crimes: &quot;Anyone engaging in illegal activity through these websites cannot be guaranteed of remaining anonymous and they might be prosecuted. The Australian Crime Commission, AFP and Customs and Border Protection are committed to targeting and combating illicit e-commerce platforms.<br />&quot;The AFP will continue to work closely with international partner agencies to combat serious and organised crime, including high-tech crime and technology-enabled crime.&quot;<br />

You buy the beat under using fake identification (easy enough) and then you use the same identification to hire a commercial shipping agent to ship it overseas via container (yeah, the big ones like on the ships). If you find the right one they will actually come and collect the car for you. The client can either collect it at the port of entry or they can have it shipped direct to your door. Whether or not the client uses a fake ID to ship it to is completely up to them, it&#039;s not my concern. <br /><br />If the client wants real anonymity once they have received it you then take the car apart and then strip down all/any identification and serial numbers that are in the vehicle itself. This isn&#039;t hard if you can find a bent mechanic. <br /><br />But yeah, that&#039;s how you do it.

				I&#039;m fucking tempted to be quite frank. Only thing holding me back is the fact that I don&#039;t think DPR would look to kindly on me emailing them and asking them to kindly fuck off because I would have to add a bomb-thread in there to mix it up a bit and if they don&#039;t fuck off then I&#039;d appreciate it if they didn&#039;t just bang on about the Bing and the Smack and start showing off my Land Rover which is easily the most balls-to-the-wall and audacious listing on here. Sending a few grams of Bing through the mail is simple. Shipping a fucking 4x4 is damn impressive. <br /><br />I want some media fucking kudos and I want it fucking now. Tony never shipped a 4x4 and he gets a mention, all he did was rip off a bunch of idiots who decided to FE. <br /><br />If you are watching Sunday Morning Herald stop just looking at the drugs, it&#039;s a blinkered way to report on SR...which you do in a shit way anyway. CUNTS!<br /><br />Oh and you blog woman whatever-your-name-is. Get off your period and shut the fuck up. <br /><br />OH and I knew fucking Murdoch has something to do with it, he needs to get a bomb threat too for all the News of The World bullshit and deleting Millie Dowler&#039;s messages on her phone to get a story after her death. The degenerate slags. And they call us animals? What kind of monster deletes a dead girls voice mails to get a story. Filthy cunts. <br /><br />Rant over. Still angry.

				On OP&#039;s topic:<br />the article seemed mostly factual and pretty fair compared to many of the sensationalist &quot;exposés&quot; I&#039;ve seen. Glad it represented SR as being run by someone at least vaguely moral and placed it above BMR and the rest.<br />Seems more focused on CP and that kind of shit than anything we&#039;re doing here, which is fine by me. Yeah, we&#039;re mentioned alongside them, but they don&#039;t misrepresent what we&#039;re doing. I mean...we are breaking the law and trading drugs.<br />Also wish they&#039;d make more mention of SR&#039;s artistic side like nomad&#039;s sculptures/figures lol.<br /><br /><br />On the rest of this thread:<br />To be fair, Tony made a hell of a lot more money from actual sales (plus all the scam cash) than Lim ever has with his land rover. When you ship out one or more of them, yeah, maybe you&#039;ll get some kudos. And I know I&#039;ll catch all sorts of negative karma for this but that really shouldn&#039;t be a thing anyway imho. Lim&#039;s probably on something right now and raging butthurt for basically no reason lol but it makes for good reading.

				Yeah point taken man. My point isn&#039;t really that they focused on Tony, it&#039;s more that they focus on shit like Smack and Bing more than anything else. And who says I haven&#039;t shipped one before? Just hasn&#039;t been done through SR...yet. ;) It will happen though. It&#039;s got to. It&#039;s just too good NOT to happen. <br /><br />And to be fair I wrote the prior posts dead sober but now I&#039;m smashed on K and Bing. :P

				BabyPowder&#039;s link was missing a .html..&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/the-drugs-in-the-mail-20120426-1xnth.html<br /><br />The article (sadly, with no mention of badass bulletproof flying transformer face-fucking Land Rovers) is copied/pasted below.<br /><br />More Australians are buying illegal drugs from internet websites and having them delivered by regular post straight to their door. Eileen Ormsby reports on the new frontier of drug dealing.<br /><br />IT&#039;S JUST like eBay, complete with vendor feedback, sales, prize giveaways, gift certificates, and escrow and dispute resolution services. But Silk Road doesn&#039;t sell CDs or used clothing - it&#039;s a one-stop, internet shop for illegal drugs. Buyers quoted on the site&#039;s forums say the drugs are cheaper and of higher quality. Customers are also keen on the fact that they no longer have to meet an unknown dealer in a dark alley somewhere.<br /><br />And the delivery of drugs bought (illegally) on the Silk Road website is not carried out by a typical drug dealer - it&#039;s done by the postman.<br /><br />A growing number of people in Australia have abandoned traditional channels for buying illicit drugs in favour of purchasing them on Silk Road. Established a little over a year ago, Silk Road has grown from a relatively small operation into a thriving marketplace where consumers of illicit substances can browse listings of everything from prescription drugs to cannabis, methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin.<br />Advertisement: Story continues below<br />Drug researcher Monica Barratt says the Silk Road website &#039;has changed the possiblities of drug distribution into the future and therefore how law enforcement bodies will have to work.<br /><br />Drug researcher Monica Barratt says the Silk Road website &#039;has changed the possiblities of drug distribution into the future and therefore how law enforcement bodies will have to work. Photo: Neil Creek<br /><br />While Silk Road has removed the ability of casual users to determine any statistical data such as number of members or number of sales in a given period, speculation from long-time members in the site&#039;s forums suggests there are more than 100,000 active buyers and 5000 transactions a week worth an average of more than $100 each.<br /><br />Statistics for the forums (that require a separate account and login details) are readily available and show nearly 11,000 new registrations so far in 2012, compared to about 8000 registrations for the whole of 2011.<br /><br />While not as simple as typing a URL into a browser, any reasonably tech-savvy person can find their way to Silk Road. Buyers place orders with sellers located in Europe and the US with the click of a button, and have the goods mailed directly to their home. Most orders arrive within two weeks, carefully vacuum-sealed and placed in a regular business envelope, greeting card or padded envelope. And all under the noses of police, Customs and Australia Post.<br />Users place orders with suppliers in Europe and the US and have them delivered to their homes.<br /><br />Users place orders with suppliers in Europe and the US and have them delivered to their homes. Photo: Joe Castro<br /><br />&#039;&#039;It&#039;s a certifiable one-stop shop for illegal drugs that represents the most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online that we have ever seen,&quot; US Democrat senator Chuck Schumer said a few months after the site&#039;s launch in 2011. &quot;It&#039;s more brazen than anything else by light years.&quot;<br /><br />Twelve months later, at a time when experts are declaring the so-called &#039;&#039;&#039;war on drugs&#039;&#039; to be a comprehensive failure, Silk Road is more brazen than ever. Users can now purchase gift certificates for their friends. And at 4.20pm (Greenwich Mean Time) on April 20, the site took the bold-faced step of holding what it called the &#039;&#039;420 Sale and Giveaway&#039;&#039; (&#039;&#039;420&#039;&#039; being the colloquial name for marijuana) during which it offered a prize to buyers - such as a voucher, an iPhone or a MacBook Air - every 420 seconds until 420 prizes had gone.<br /><br />For the duration of the event, the site&#039;s owner, known as &#039;&#039;Dread Pirate Roberts&#039;&#039; waived commission on all sales, and vendors offered further discounts on their wares. It finished with a draw for the grand prize of a holiday for two to &#039;&#039;paradise&#039;&#039; which included $2000 spending money.<br /><br />It was no less than blatant nose-thumbing to the authorities. It also followed a report released earlier this month by think tank Australia21 that said the tough-on-drugs policy had failed and that other options for controlling drugs, such as decriminalisation or regulation, should be considered.<br /><br />The report, which was backed by two former premiers, a former chief minister, a former national police chief and other eminent Australians, says the law-and-order approach to drugs cannot possibly stop a growing trade that thrives on its illegality and black market status.<br /><br />&quot;The international and Australian prohibition of the use of certain &#039;illicit&#039; drugs has failed comprehensively,&quot; the Australia21 report says.<br /><br />&quot;By making the supply and use of certain drugs criminal acts, governments everywhere have driven their production and consumption underground and have fostered the development of a criminal industry.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />Monica Barratt, a research fellow at the National Drug Research Institute, who specialises in understanding how drug trends are affected by the internet, came across Silk Road while researching her PhD thesis. &quot;I was pretty astounded,&quot; she says.<br /><br />Barratt&#039;s studies into Silk Road and similar websites have strengthened her belief that supply reduction methods currently in use in Australia have failed to adequately respond to the challenges of new technologies.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s pretty clear from looking at the forums that Australians are very interested in the site and I think it&#039;s pretty clear that they&#039;re successfully using it,&quot; she says. &quot;Silk Road should actually prompt us to reconsider prohibition in its totality.&quot;<br /><br />This does not necessarily mean full legalisation. She says there are several ways to do this using models between the two extremes. &quot;I think it has to be evidence-based. I think we have to tread very cautiously.&quot;<br /><br />She says the situation in Portugal, which decriminalised the possession and use of personal supplies of all drugs in 2001, although not perfect, is worth looking at. For users of Silk Road, any risk of getting caught is offset by competitive pricing (cocaine and ecstasy sell for about a quarter of Australian street prices), the quality of the product and the ease of ordering. Customers are quoted as saying the site&#039;s lively forums discussing sellers and providing independent scientific testing of their wares make for a safer experience than the traditional back alley or lounge room deal.<br /><br />Barratt agrees that on this front Silk Road is probably safer than an illegal face-to-face deal. &quot;Assuming they&#039;re buying from a reputable seller and it&#039;s someone who doesn&#039;t want to risk their rating by selling something that wasn&#039;t what they said it was, then you&#039;ve got a system there where the seller has a really strong imperative to do the right thing by the buyer.&quot;<br /><br />She also points out that Silk Road has an entire forum dedicated to drug safety, with advice on harm reduction and best practices. &quot;There are a number of threads there [by users] seeking help and safer ways of injecting.&quot;<br /><br />Some buyers say it is also important to minimise threats other than health risks that are associated with illegal drugs, such as the possibility of violence. The feedback and dispute-resolution systems also reduce the likelihood of being ripped off.<br /><br />As with eBay or Amazon, the credentials of the seller can be checked through the user-feedback system before an order is placed. Payment is placed in escrow until the goods are received and any disputes can be referred to the site&#039;s administrators for resolution.<br /><br />Silk Road can only be accessed through The Onion Router (TOR), a program that protects identities and makes IP addresses untraceable. While TOR and programs like it are important tools for freedom of expression, allowing people in suppressed countries to obtain or disseminate information without fear of exposure, the flipside is that it gives access to the &#039;&#039;darknet&#039;&#039;, a place where criminal activity can take place without detection.<br /><br />Because of this anonymity, several vendors are happy to discuss their experience via private message. All say they prefer selling through the website rather than face-to-face dealing, partly because it increases their market to anywhere in the world that has computers and internet connections, but also because of the reduced risk of violence.<br /><br />Last week, after a two-year operation by US drug enforcement agencies, eight men were arrested in the US, the Netherlands and Colombia in connection with a similar site - The Farmer&#039;s Market - that also sold illicit drugs online. The Farmer&#039;s Market accepted various forms of payment, including cash, Western Union and PayPal, and it is likely the electronic trail left by such methods led to the arrests. The only accepted method of payment at Silk Road is Bitcoin, the encrypted virtual currency used for online gaming, which is supposed to prevent financial transactions from being traced.<br /><br />Buying Bitcoins (worth $5.30 each) is anonymous and simple - some customers use a hotmail account to request a quote, and then make a direct cash deposit at a local bank branch. With the anonymity provided by TOR and Bitcoin, and vendors who are expert at packaging drugs to avoid detection, it seems little can currently be done by Australian law enforcement bodies to prevent end-users making online drug purchases.<br /><br />Efforts are being made, however, to develop partnerships with overseas agencies to combat this kind of online crime. Last year, senior members of the New South Wales fraud and cybercrime squad met with US Secret Service officials in Washington and discussed several common targets, including drugs being sold over the internet.<br /><br />How successful such partnerships can be remains to be seen.<br /><br />The Australia21 report poses the questions: &quot;How can drug prohibition succeed in the community when it cannot even succeed in keeping prisons free of drugs? How can authorities stem the flow of drugs, when drug traffickers are better funded than drug law enforcement?&quot;<br /><br />Another question Australia21 might have asked is how can prohibition succeed when technology allows sites such as Silk Road not only to exist, but to flourish.<br /><br />&quot;Drug use and the demand for drug use isn&#039;t changing, so if for some reason Silk Road is suppressed or removed, there will just be another supply channel pop up,&quot; says Barratt.<br /><br />Her research has led her to conclude that there are four possible ways to stop sites such as Silk Road from selling drugs online. One is to try to regulate overseas internet content through the federal government&#039;s proposed internet filter. But she doubts whether the filter, should it eventuate, would have any effect on Silk Road because it operates in what is known as the &quot;hidden web&quot;, also known as the darknet.<br /><br />A second strategy is to ban the technologies necessary for Silk Road to work - TOR and Bitcoin. But she says this is unlikely to be possible because both are peer-to-peer technologies and it is difficult to imagine how such a ban could be enforced.<br /><br />The third is to increase scanning of posted letters and parcels. But she says while scanning of parcel post has been increased over the past few years, it is not clear how effective such measures are and what impact they have on the speed of the postal system.<br /><br />While the detection of drugs in the mail has increased, Australia Post does not have the resources to effectively scan every piece of the estimated 5 billion mail items it handles every year - LSD, for example, is distributed as invisible dots on a sheet of ordinary-looking paper.<br /><br />Asked what action it was taking to combat the increasing delivery of drugs by mail, a spokeswoman for Australia Post said: &#039;&#039;This is a matter for the Australian Federal Police and law enforcement agencies.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />The fourth is for law enforcement agencies to infiltrate Silk Road to gather intelligence. &quot;I&#039;m absolutely 100 per cent sure the AFP and CIA are aware of it,&quot; Barratt says. But she also wonders how effective such agencies can be in disrupting the Silk Road market.<br /><br />Australian Crime Commission chief John Lawler says the commission is aware of online marketplaces such as Silk Road and is working with several government and law enforcement agencies to combat high-tech and &#039;&#039;technology enabled&#039;&#039; crime.<br /><br />&#039;&#039;Drug deals once occurring face-to-face are now able to be conducted online, with the seller and the buyer never having to meet face-to-face,&#039;&#039; Lawler says. &#039;&#039;This provides both parties a perception of anonymity and safety. It also provides organised criminal networks with the largest potential client base ever available.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />Chris McDonald, an associate professor in computer science at the University of Western Australia and Dartmouth College in the US, says the federal government &#039;&#039; has no chance of beating existing encryption technology such as the TOR network&#039;&#039;.<br /><br />Indeed, he says it is unlikely that anyone has the technology to crack Silk Road at the moment and, even if it did, privacy laws would not allow governments to compel the site&#039;s owners to hand over encryption codes.<br /><br />According to its annual report, the AFP seized more than five tonnes of illegal drugs last year. It is unlikely that Silk Road and sites like it are making much of a dent in the wholesale traffic trade to Australia - yet. But as Barratt points out, it is becoming increasingly clear that online drug marketplaces pose unique challenges for drug prohibition.<br /><br />&#039;&#039;Silk Road is a new frontier in drug distribution,&#039;&#039; Barratt says. &#039;&#039;What we don&#039;t know is how popular such sites will become and therefore how much influence they have. Regardless of what happens next with Silk Road, its existence has changed the possibilities of drug distribution into the future and therefore how law enforcement bodies will have to work. Policy-makers must keep these challenges in mind when considering alternative ways to control and regulate drugs.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />Eileen Ormsby is a Melbourne journalist.<br /><br />Read more: http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/the-drugs-in-the-mail-20120426-1xnth.html#ixzz1xWFgcbBh<br />
