				Ive been using SR for sometime now but even before Silk Road I have been getting drugs in the mail. Since my first package of drugs in the mail I have probably got stuff shipped a few dozen places with that many different mail people. I rarely have any problems with the mail guys but I have suspected the mail guy of stealing my drugs in 1 particular address several times. Also, if you tell your friends about Silk Road and they live close they might start checking your mailbox for goodies lol.
