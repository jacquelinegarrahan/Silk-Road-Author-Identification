				yes it unlocks that feature after a certain number of posts... not sure what that number is... I am sure someone will pipe up if they know.<br /><br />and the info I thought useful was the over the counter meds to help with H withdrawl...

I was gonna neg you for the lulz but I read that thing you said about H withdrawals as well, so I won&#039;t be a dick. Karma probably isn&#039;t going to decide whether you live or die, stop caring and it&#039;s just amusing. If you think your online persona accurately reflects your personality then you&#039;re doing it wrong, you should really not let the opinion of anonymous strangers on the internet effect you like that.<br /><br />Getting offended by opinions shows you don&#039;t know how to control your emotions, in my humble opinion ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Touche. <br /><br />Ur avatar makes me happy btw

				In the eyes of society we may be bad people, but you alone judge the goodness of your self...&nbsp; Is society good?&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the karma deal on the forum is&nbsp; dumb and cheapens the useful aspect of the forum.&nbsp; If I sit on here all day and post dumb stuff enough I get to dole out karma points on top of my dumb posts?&nbsp; This forum is full of useful information I&#039;m sure, but people looking to reap some sort of reward for the number of posts are kinda filling it up with useless bs and retarded jokes (even some moderator(s)), that we now have to sort through to find posts worth reading.
