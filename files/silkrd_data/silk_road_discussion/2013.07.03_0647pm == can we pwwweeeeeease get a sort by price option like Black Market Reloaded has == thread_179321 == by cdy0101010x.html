				When I&#039;m searching, I LOVE using the &quot;bestselling&quot; and &quot;newest&quot; sorting options, but it would be so great to be able to sort by cost.<br /><br />On a semi-related note, I have about $9.25 left over from a purchase, what should I buy? Are there any good cheap samples out there right now? Should I buy a pill or two? Enter a lottery?

				This is a feature that has been requested many times so far. It&#039;s probably one of the MOST requested features, I don&#039;t know why it hasn&#039;t been implemented.

				Although having the ability to sort by price definitely opens up more purchasing options, I feel that many newbs will end up getting scammed by using this feature. I&#039;ve noticed that most vendors selling items at &quot;too good to be true&quot; prices, are usually up to no good. But hey, I&#039;m smart enough not to get swindled so what do I care?

				It&#039;s good to see this new feature works and is a great thing for finding the best deal, unfortunately there&#039;s going to be a lot of people taking advantage of it to get free samples etc. <br />Also a lot better than Atlantis&#039;s &quot;sort by lowest price&quot; option, which displays as &quot;$1.00&quot;...&quot;$1.25&quot;...&quot;$12,000.00&quot;...&quot;$0.50&quot; lmao

				That option isn&#039;t very efficient because it doesn&#039;t calculate the shipping cost + the cost of the product making this type of search difficult like always.
