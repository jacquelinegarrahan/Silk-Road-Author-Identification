				That&#039;s a NoScript message blocking JavaScript which is part of SMF. You can disable the message by clicking the NoScript icon in the toolbar -&gt; Options -&gt; Notifications -&gt; Show message about blocked scripts.<br /><br />Did you turn on NoScript recently? Because it should have been notifying you of blocked scripts before.<br />

				That&#039;s up to you.<br /><br />You will lose some functionality on some sites by blocking scripts. There is a small by non-zero probability that they could do something malicious.<br />

				okay thanks astor. i have the option to allow scripts on all or allow scripts for the forum only. should i just allow the scripts for the forum ? this is weird because i dnt remember changing anything and it just changed on its own after the forum was updated.

				The only functionality that I&#039;ve noticed that gets disabled with JavaScript blocked is the ability to insert smilies into posts and the modal dialog box to confirm deleting multiple PMs. If you can live without those features, you can keep scripts disabled on the forum. Just disable the notification too.<br />

				That&#039;s kinda weird...&nbsp; I mean, all my forum pages here have shown on the bottom left of the screen, &quot;Scripts Currently Forbidden&quot;, although there is no yellow background ever since I started using it.&nbsp; I never have messed with the settings or really gave it much thought.&nbsp; Just figured it&#039;s default settings are the safest and I&#039;ve not had problems using the forum.&nbsp; But after reading your post, I wonder if maybe I should be doing something with my settings.&nbsp; I have wondered (but not a whole lot) why when I use TorMail, I only can use squirrel mail because square cube mail won&#039;t let me use it because of javascript being disabled.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind, and it&#039;s not disabled outside of TOR... that I know of.&nbsp; I should just leave the settings as they are... right?

The reason you just noticed this notification is either:<br /><br />a) you just happened to notice<br /><br />b) you turned on NoScript recently<br /><br />JavaScript has always been a part of this forum. I noticed the notifications myself long ago when I turned on NoScript and didn&#039;t have the notifications disabled. Nothing has changed about that. You are simply mistaken about this being a new notification on the forum.<br /><br />What should you do?<br /><br />a) Disable JavaScript on the forum?&nbsp; Yes, that&#039;s fine.<br /><br />b) Leave JavaScript on?&nbsp; Yes, that&#039;s also fine.<br /><br />I see no problem with either option and you&#039;ve turned a non-issue into an issue.<br />

				Thanks astor for confirming that something I&#039;d not given thought to or had a problem with is because it&#039;s not a problem.&nbsp; Only seeing this post caused me to even slightly question the non-issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s good to have someone like you around to keep some balance..&nbsp; ;)
