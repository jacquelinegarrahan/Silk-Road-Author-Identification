				So explicitly specify that your buyers MUST use PGP to send the address.&nbsp; I had to read through your wall of text to see that you ask (nicely) for buyers to use PGP, but you aren&#039;t requiring it.&nbsp; Also, PGP isn&#039;t a requirement to place an order on SR.&nbsp; If you were to cancel my order and &quot;give me a scolding&quot; as you say, I&#039;d look elsewhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do have to laugh at the part about you informing people to not contact you until at least 30 days have passed without receiving a package.&nbsp; Do you understand the definition of auto-finalize?&nbsp; You aren&#039;t asking for anyone to FE, yet you require people to give you a 5/5 while &quot;waiting to receive the order&quot; and to then not contact you for at least a month if something doesn&#039;t come in.<br /><br />I&#039;ll pass.&nbsp; Then again, I live in the USA so I don&#039;t really need to worry about looking you up.

It&#039;s their own security. <br /><br />Plus they can enter the resolution, obviously they should not let it autofinalize. Please learn about SR before you comment here newbie. Thanks. <br /><br />And I don&#039;t cancel there order. If you could read English you can see that I did not mention anything about cancelling their order. What I am saying is they make a mistake in the address box when filling their order and then they MESSAGE me on SR with their address so their address is in my inbox.

				Did DPR not state before that the addresses were already encrypted and the only way they get traced is if the vendor keeps them on the system?<br /><br />So if your customers get caught then you have also been caught?
