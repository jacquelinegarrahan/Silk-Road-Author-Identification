				And good luck with that BTW.<br /><br />As near as I can figure getting access to the vendor&#039;s forum for new vendors is simply a lost cause.<br /><br />Thank the gods for advice from senior vendor friends in SILC chat.. cause Vendor Forum access request get/got ZERO traction.<br /><br />Oh well.. route around the obstacle and do without it. <br /><br />cheers<br />

				Thanks for the reply Philter. :)<br /><br />If that&#039;s the case it&#039;s a bit shit isn&#039;t it? I presume the vendor forum is a wealth of knowledge regarding all sorts of things that will help vendors get business and keep customers happy, so if it&#039;s an exclusive club that&#039;s a but tight i feel.<br /><br />I can&#039;t see a reason for it either really other than being a bit elitist. I&#039;m assuming there is no open chatting about anything that LE would find incriminating and people are just as careful regarding security as they are on this forum.<br /><br />I suppose the Vendor Forum was never mentioned as a reason to sign up as a vendor, but when you hear it&#039;s there but you can&#039;t get access even though you have paid the money for an account it just seems a bit off.<br /><br />Oh well, maybe you have to have a certain amount of transactions. It would just be nice to have some clarifications.<br /><br />

				This has been an ongoing discussion &#039;over there&#039;... yes you paid your vendor fee but I think I speak for the majority of vendors (the ones that voted at least) that getting access to the forum is for ACTIVE vendors who sell ILLEGAL products. It is not a &#039;boys club&#039; or some elite thing we have going on... just doing our best to keep it private for those vendors who need it most. If you sell legal products &#039;only&#039; or have hardly any sales then you most likely don&#039;t need to be there or you need to prove you are here to be an active vendor... as far as the &#039;Private Info&#039; or special info dealing with LE... meh, there isn&#039;t anything there that hasn&#039;t been published here 1000 times. The ONLY thing most important for us vendors in regards to vendor info are our extensive asshole buyers lists... yes scammers we ARE tracking you!!<br /><br />In fact lets make this an informative thread to assist the buyers... how to get on the &#039;Bad Buyer or Suspicious Buyer&#039; list:<br /><br />1. Ask us to take anything other than BTC<br />2. Leave us a less than 5/5 feedback without telling us why, or just being unfair in general. <br />3. Copy/Paste the same suspicious message to multiple vendors (we compare msgs)<br />4. extorting a vendor by saying you will leave bad feedback to get something extra or free<br />5. saying the package didn&#039;t arrive when the tracking says it did.<br /><br />Let me better explain #2 as I know this could cause some controversy. As a buyer you have the &#039;right&#039; to leave us a bad review. We vendors have virtually no recourse since we have no way to respond to a bad review. Sometimes it IS our fault and there have been many posts from vendors in the vendor forum where a vendor has asked for our opinion and we have sided with the buyer... many times!! we do make mistakes and the vendor forum is a great way for us to discuss what went wrong and how to improve future orders.<br />With that said there are also many unreasonable and simply put &#039;asshole&#039; buyers who expect way more than what we can provide and &#039;demand&#039; free product... and other unreasonable requests. For example say a buyer leaves me a 4/5 due to the package arriving a day late... I shipped it when I said I would so if it got there a day late is that really MY fault? of course it isn&#039;t my fault. So what I would do is explain the situation and provide proof to the other vendors via messages and shipping info and provide the buyers user name... this in no way will keep this buyer from being able to purchase from other vendors, it just gives others vendors the heads up that the buyer &#039;could&#039; be a potential problem person and if you deal with them you have been warned.<br /><br />The feedback system is a powerful tool and as a buyer you should respect the fact that many of us work very hard and will pay a TERRIBLE price if we get caught... please leave fair feedback. If you are not happy with something PLEASE contact the vendor first and try and resolve it before it gets this far. My only 4/5 was a guy who simply thought the quality of one of my products was not up to par... fair enough, we discussed it and I thanked him for his honest interpretation. I didn&#039;t put him on the list as he didn&#039;t deserve to be there, he was just being honest. <br /><br />That should cover the vendor forum... if you have any questions feel free to msg me.<br /><br />Thanks!!<br />TJ<br /><br />PS: and for the paranoid folks: your private info such as name or address is NEVER posted over there... that will get a vendor banned... we do have rules.

				+1 Karma Jonesy, couldn&#039;t have put it better myself. Good to see you back by the way. :)<br /><br />Anyway yeah to be allowed into the vendor forum you have got to be a True-Playa. Nobody is saying that you aren&#039;t one Black-Tuna and nobody is saying you wont be allowed in there, you just have to prove your metal by getting your sales history up so you can be properly vetted by DigitalAlch. It&#039;s the same process for everybody so you shouldn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s elitism, it&#039;s just going through the motions. You have to see the security issue as well, what if LE sets up a vendor account and they got let in? That&#039;s something we have to try and protect against. <br /><br />Also just to clarify although Mods can recommend people to be allowed in the Vendor Forum that doesn&#039;t mean we can let you in, the only person who can do that is DigitalAlchemist. Just wanted to clarify this because I think sometimes people think Mods have more power than we do. We are actually basically glorified janitors/referees. That&#039;s about it.

				I will help Limitless out on this one as he is all over the place...lol<br /><br />The &#039;Vendor Roundtable&#039; as it is called is located just below the Off Topic section... except if you are not an approved/vetted vendor then you won&#039;t be able to see it.<br />Vendors who can see it are the ones with &#039;SR Vendor&#039; directly below their forum name.<br /><br />As stated before, it is just a place where we vendors can get together and discuss potential issues involving what we do. There is no &#039;super secret&#039; info there anyone is missing out on... there is no reason to regurgitate the same great info that is already in the Security thread.<br /><br />Mostly we discuss buyer/vendor issues and how to avoid scammer buyers.... as I stated previously.<br /><br />I know DigitalAlch is gonna be hating us Lim for putting this out but you can&#039;t keep secrets on here... lol<br /><br />If you are a vendor and want access msg DigitalAlch. With that said... there have already been a few rules semi-established but the powers that be may have more so this is just a simple guide:<br /><br />1. You MUST sell an illegal product.<br />2. You MUST have sales under your belt... I don&#039;t know how many but I doubt having 5 is going to cut it...<br />3. and lastly don&#039;t be a CUNT...

				Thanks for the replies guys, that&#039;s all i wanted. :)<br /><br />To be honest i assumed there would probably be some kind of level of rep/sales/uncuntiness that needed to be ascertained before being allowed in but i wasn&#039;t getting anywhere when trying to find out about it. It just seemed very hush hush. :)<br /><br />I am happy to wait until DigitalAlch sees fit to let me in.<br /><br />The main reason that i wanted to get in was the shared list of known scammers. That is pretty valuable info to a new vendor.<br /><br />Anyway, cheers for clearing it up.<br /><br />BTG

				Lol yeah Jonesy pretty much rapped it up in a nutshell there. <br /><br />And yeah but to be honest everyone knows the Vendor Roundtable exists anyway, it get&#039;s referenced on here all the time so it&#039;s no secret. I mean Christ, the fact this thread exists at all demonstrates this point. <br /><br />But yeah just follow Jonesy&#039;s 3 magic rules (kudos on the &quot;Don&#039;t be a cunt&quot; by the way, like it!) and then apply and you&#039;ll most likely be let in. <br /><br />Just to add in though, it&#039;s the vendors that have SR Vendor DIRECTLY BELOW their name. If you see &quot;SR Vendor&quot; below their post count and Karma score then they have put that there themselves by just entering it into their personal text. IMO doing this is a shady practice because you are basically imitating a tag that has to be earned and given by the powers that be. I would always recommend you stay away from vendors that do this, an example of where I have seen it is Mister Dank, use the link below to see what I mean - <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=1958<br /><br />
