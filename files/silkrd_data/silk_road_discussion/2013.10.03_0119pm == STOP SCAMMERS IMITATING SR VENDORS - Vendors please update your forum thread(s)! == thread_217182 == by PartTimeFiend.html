				I&#039;ve noticed more than a few top SR vendors are appearing on the other marketplaces.&nbsp; Although some of these may be genuine, we know some of them will be scammers looking to cash in on the good reputation of the REAL vendor.&nbsp; This has happened previously when the SR has been down for a few days and especially during that 2 week period earlier this year!<br /><br />I&#039;ve also noticed some well-known vendors coming on with the &quot;I&#039;ve forgotten my SR forum password&quot;, so my new name on the SR forums is INSERT SIMILAR VENDOR NAME and my new profile page on Sheep or BMR is INSERT LINK, etc....&nbsp; hmmmmm!<br /><br />While I accept some of these vendors may have actually forgotten their passwords and are genuinely migrating to other marketplaces, we also know this is a classic scammer tactic.&nbsp; So all you REAL vendors out there, if you can update your forum thread(s) with a message to let us know your plans that would be great.&nbsp; That way we can name and shame the &quot;imitation scammers&quot;,&nbsp; OR if you are migrating, we can go to the alternative marketplace knowing that this is REALLY you, and continue to do business with you.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />PartTimeFiend x

				I&#039;ve noticed some H vendors have been migrating across to the other marketplaces.&nbsp; The following info may help some UK people:<br /><br />Frank Matthews said on his forum thread that he&#039;s going over to Sheep as vendor name &quot;FM&quot;.&nbsp; I had a look and there is a frankmatthews vendor, but it only has coke listed, not Franks usual long menu.&nbsp; &nbsp;Watch this space...&nbsp; maybe he&#039;s still setting up his page.<br /><br />BestOn3 was a very reliable next day delivery UK #3 H vendor.&nbsp; Yesterday he popped up on these forums under the slightly different name Best_On3 (he said he forgot his forum password).&nbsp; He said he&#039;d opened up a vendor account on Sheep.&nbsp; This is the link: -<br /><br />http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion/account/profile/e2fdd64496f10e7624addfc01306626c<br /><br />I asked Best_On3 to send me some information so that I would be able to verify this was really him.&nbsp; He gave me specific info about his shipping methods so I&#039;m 100% confident that this is the real BestOn3 and not a scammer.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope this helps people.<br /><br />Can&#039;t say I&#039;m all that happy about the prospect of using a new marketplace...&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure others feel the same....<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />PTF

				Good idea.<br /><br />For those vendors who did have forum threads, if they would post on their existing usernames here to inform us of their establishment at alternative markets it would confirm their authenticity.

				Don&#039;t change your PGP key.&nbsp; If both folks still have it in their respective keychains, then it&#039;s the same person.<br /><br />If the &quot;new&quot; person has a new key, or is using new software to generate it, or a new OS to generate it, then it&#039;s fishy.
