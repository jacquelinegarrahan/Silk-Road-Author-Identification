They&#039;re efforts have effectively created and maintained a portal that has made it safer and easier for people to obtain drugs and other goods in a manner that will not get them robbed, stabbed, shot or outright killed. We are all doing our part in this in some way, no matter how small, vendors and buyers alike.&nbsp; This short document is the opinions of myself and my associates regarding the current state of&nbsp; SR as well as its indeterminate future. I&nbsp; understand far less than the Administrators do about how difficult it is to manage a site like this however this does not negate the fact that there are issues that plague SR that concern me and many others. <br />&nbsp; <br />Introduction<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been fortunate enough to have been a member of Silk Road for almost a year new. I have met many&nbsp; people who think as I do about not only drugs but the inherent freedom as Americans&nbsp; that all of us have the right to choose what we put in our bodies. Furthermore, I believe Vendors should have a right to a profession that they can dedicate themselves to, and hopefully enjoy ( I know I do). This enjoyment does not come strictly from the monetary benefit.&nbsp; I am not going to dance around the issue, yes I AM A DRUG DEALER. No, I don&#039;t feel bad about it. Just because a negative stigma has been associated with the term in does not mean I will live up to some negative societal stereotype.&nbsp; &nbsp;This drug war is being led by overzealous individuals who have an agenda,&nbsp; law enforcement and politicians would like nothing more than to shut down one of the last safe havens of freedom the Silk Road. They are out there, and we know they are out there; which is why we must be all the more vigilant.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let me get something clear...&nbsp; This is not a negative bash on SR or the people in it.&nbsp; I have many good things to say about SR&nbsp; which I will touch on shortly.&nbsp; What my associates and I have observed is a rapid change in SR, in just the span of one year.&nbsp; Let me begin with this....What is with all the people who want to use SR as a personal &quot;Veil&quot; (For lack of a better word).&nbsp; A place where many hide behind&nbsp; feigned qualities such as friendliness, honesty, integrity and&nbsp; real business acumen. Fake qualities that builds the trust of new and veteran buyers alike. Behind the digital veil more and more&nbsp; &quot;crooks&quot; or perhaps &quot;traitors&quot; if you prefer that word work tirelessly to serve their own interests by building customer trust through months of dedication to serve one end... earn a great reputation, then fuck people over. As many of you know there have been an number of individuals who literally robbed the shit out of people on SR. Not through violence or the threat of violence but by choosing the easy way out; hiding behind the veil of anonymity. During the last major bitcoin crash many of these individuals bailed. They had overextended themselves and their BTC market positions. This situation put many in a position of fight or flight. Since there is quite simply no one to fight due to anonymity of what SR is then flight was the only option. To bail, skedaddle, boogie and,&nbsp; RUN!. Unfortunately this meant financial disaster of which Vendors faced the biggest blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major issue is tons and tons of people signing up. This is not a major issue in and of itself it&#039;s simply a matter of the people who are signing up..... mainly kids (who should not be on SR in the first place) and crooks. Furthermore, us vendors are constantly being hassled for free samples. I do it every now and again because the person says they will get more product but I never hear from the person again. Therefore I am out $50-$70 bucks every time this stuff happens, but hey that&#039;s water under the bridge.<br />We can discuss these matters round and round so let me humbly sum up the current state of SR in three categories.<br /><br />1 . The GOOD&nbsp; :)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silk Road exists on the dark net or underground net whatever you prefer. A place where in my opinion it is kept semi secret. SR is a place where people can be themselves for good or bad. People can get pretty much any drug they want to.&nbsp; I know people have said this before but I really wish SR could be like fight club &quot;First rule about Fight Club is: You don&#039;t talk about Fight Club ( I don&#039;t) Try to do the same.<br /><br />2. The BAD&nbsp; :(<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR unfortunately will not be around forever. Either it will evolve into something better and stronger or somehow they will find a way to shut it down which makes me a very very sad panda&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />3. The Ugly&nbsp; :o<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SR has been infiltrated by LE, Scammers and, other Various undesirables. Anonymity is a double edged sword. The same protection that is gained by anonymity is taken advantage of by those with no soul and no conscience.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For SR to survive it has to stay&nbsp; underground in the deep web. If everybody knows about SR and similar sites the will media will pitch a fit and the government will shut it down. It&#039;s all part of the Government media complex Because of pressure from the media/Government, the only reason it still exits is b/c it is small and doesn&#039;t have much impact and does not promote violence etc.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many I have experienced tragic losses and mistrusted the intentions of individuals who I deemed trustworthy; the trials and tribulations of when I was a newbie. Many of you have heard me say this before but this SR and anonymity site are truly the epiphany of the double edged sword parable. It is difficult to screw someone over when you see someone because visual contact and even conversation add a human characteristic, the boldest people in real live may rob you and they may be prosecuted if they are caught. In the SR world this is not the case and to find someone and want revenge is almost impossible. For even the meekest and weakest, those with no self respect can be the crook, the liar, the thief because they can hide behind their computer screen with the protocols and encryption they have so cleverly endowed it with. Unfortunately,&nbsp; in a world of anonymity the human connection has been broken, we see people (vendors and buyers alike) as a username and a public key and perhaps a bit coin address not real people.<br /><br />God bless you all, and long live Silk Road.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Dr. White<br /><br />Comments Welcome.....&nbsp; :-\<br />

				Interesting. I sure hope it stays around cause where I live don&#039;t cut it, I might as well stop using. I do like his rule about the fight club and really the only person I have told about it is my best friend and he hasnt even engaged in the thought of tryin SR out.<br /><br />Good info though.

				I think you should tell the right people about SR, to balance out the number of LE and crooks. We don&#039;t need a bunch of teenagers messing up the feedback system, but we do need responsible drug users with jobs and ethics.

				I love it! Great work, sir. I believe TSR ultimately supplies users with cleaner, safer, and oftentimes cheaper methods of getting high. I think we all can agree this is always going to be better than getting doped up on bath salts from your local smoke shop. There are the good and the bad in regards to vendors and buyers, but that will always be the case in any aspect of life.

I can blow many holes in your flippant dismissals of The Powers That Be, even better the term Government Media Complex, a phrase coined by Michael Savage. <br />I don&#039;t see the &quot;government&quot;(s) struggling or having to bail a drop of water. What&#039;s left of Americas Gov&#039;t bails out cronies and Unions with OUR money, in exchange for votes and power. They very well could be on the eve of destruction, not just of the internet, but our country as we once knew it! - The current ruling class, masquerades as liberal democrats, yet all I see are far left radicals. Throwbacks to the 60&#039;s, and their inbred offspring, who would like nothing more than to get MORE POWER! - They&#039;re dying to control the internet! The same way Communist countries already do. They&#039;ve more than once tried to pass anti-free speech laws. 1st with The Fairness Doctrine, though that didn&#039;t go through, they still managed to control the media. <br /><br />Gone are the days of the reporter doing an &quot;in depth&quot; investigation, on anyone remotely connected to the White House. The Press pool waits for team Obama to tell them what stories to run. This desease of &quot;group think&quot; has been spreading across the land like a virus.&nbsp; The exponentially growing dependent class, paradoxically grows with an already gargantuan Gov&#039;t, and their &quot;group think&quot; is that we&#039;re all stupid, and need &quot;the state&quot; (The Gov&#039;t) to take care of us!<br /><br />GM General Motors, became Gov&#039;t Motors, GE became Gov&#039;t Electric- with almost every facet of that company, outsourced to China, by Obama&#039;s pal Jeff Immelt. - Immelts reward for this? - Why he was made the &quot;Jobs Czar&quot;. <br /><br />Obama himself isn&#039;t qualified to be in the FBI, CIA, or Secret Service, simply based on a preliminary backround check. (they wouldn&#039;t have to dig deep to disqualify him). Yet he holds the office of the most powerful man in the country! - Am I the only one who notices this?<br /><br />If not, then why has he been given a second term? Why does it seem like he&#039;s running for a third already?<br /><br />BIG PHARMA along with the DEA, and the IRS, would LOVE to get their hands on everyone in this game. Vendors more so, no doubt. <br /><br />The government want&#039;s to control healthcare, and take away your right to go to the doctor of your choosing. - I know he said the opposite during the election, but that was just one in a million lies. <br /><br />They don&#039;t want you or I to &quot;make decisions&quot; on what drugs work for us, as only we would know best. They want the power! They want the MONEY! <br /><br />All of this REVENUE! As they like to call the illegal taxes heaped upon the last of the hard working Americans. <br /><br /><br />I won&#039;t go on. You get the gist of my rant, I take it. <br /><br />Just please! Please don&#039;t delude yourself into a false sense of security!!<br /><br />They&#039;re counting on it!<br /><br />Why do you think they want to &quot;disarm&quot; the citizenry?&nbsp; They&#039;re afraid of insurrection!!<br /><br />If you look back over history, one of the two common threads concerning tyrannical dictators is - Promising free healthcare, and the confiscating the citizens guns!<br /><br />The misuse or &quot;over-indulgence&quot; of drugs, is something they count on! Why else would George Soros have been the first person (a foreigner yet) to pump 1 Million Dollars into the first &quot;Legalize Pot&quot; referendum?&nbsp; Soros, another billionaire friend of Obama, made his billions, manipulating currencies of other countries, and betting they would fail, as a fait accompli!<br /><br />The bitcoin could very well be Soros&#039;s work. If not originally, he &quot;acquired&quot; it, by the same &quot;Dr Evil&quot; tactics that got him where he is today. It&#039;s a plausible scenario, especially if you&#039;ve been follwing world politics for the past 40 years. <br /><br />Maybe, (for now), they want us all high and stoned, so they can walk around our home and steal everything from it we worked so hard for, while telling you &quot;You didn&#039;t build that&quot;! <br /><br />That line coming from a &quot;community organizer&quot; who never created anything, let alone hold down a job. The skids have been greased for him his whole life.<br /><br />This is more than just an &quot;American&quot; problem obviously. It&#039;s a lot of wealthy internationalists, pulling the strings on our puppet governments, and having us &quot;think&quot; we elected them!<br /><br />It&#039;s the power hungry feeding off the power hungry. - The biggest threat to the control freaks that make up our governments? - FREEDOM and&nbsp; LIBERTY !<br /><br />If you still don&#039;t see the possibility of SR going bye bye, just imagine a high profile case of some &quot;beloved&quot; celebrity, overdosing on some drugs that were bought on here. - I recently made this analogy in another thread, where some bong head kid, wanted to print up Silk Road Merchandise, yet couldn&#039;t see through the pot smoke in his moms basement the possible &quot;unintended consequences&quot; of his &quot;bright idea&quot;. <br /><br />Only to see otherwise normally sane forum members, claim to see &quot;nothing wrong with it&quot;. - More like they refuse to see it. This denial of what people simply don&#039;t want to talk about, is very dangerous. <br /><br />If it does all come crashing down, you&#039;ll know who to blame. <br /><br />I for one will not go quietly. <br /><br />I&#039;ll certainly take a few of them out before they get me. At least wound a few&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Still free!<br /><br />jagfug<br />

				I love your post, sir! The only edit I would make to your post is at the beginning of&nbsp; your second sentence. You have they&#039;re; instead you should use their. Otherwise it&#039;d be like you saying, &quot;they are efforts&quot;. <br /><br />I love SR because I know that I am getting a more pure form of my drug of choice. Sometimes the drugs are even SUPER PURE (80+ pure). It&#039;s great and healthier for those who shoot up heroin, isn&#039;t it nice to be able to get filtered cold-shoot heroin from hatter26? I love being able to buy such amazing marijuana for such awesome prices; here where I live, an ounce of some dank bud would cost me anywhere from $375-400. I can get that same bud here on SR for $200; it&#039;s great and I love it! <br /><br />

				+1 <br /><br />Much respect to you for taking the time to express your thoughts on the state of the road. Personally, I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing more posts of this nature by members like yourself and others with similar status. <br /><br />I definitely agree with what you&#039;ve expressed here and major points. Especially the reality of point #3.know&nbsp; Having observed and felt some of these changes myself,&nbsp; It&#039;s comforting to see these topics acknowledged openly and directly the way you have here. I hope it sparks meaningful and more frequent discussion from all walks of this community, especially in relation to #2 and #3.<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;Many of you have heard me say this before but this SR and anonymity site are truly the epiphany of the double edged sword parable.&quot;<br /><br />So true on many fronts. One that&#039;s plagued my mind lately is the ability for established members to comfortably remain as such in the community over the long term out of concern for #3 (ie increased presence unwanted malicious parties). From a personal security standpoint, it seems wise to reincarnate one&#039;s identity every so often, but definitely wise when intuition/common sense demands it. It seems plausible that such anonymous self preservation could be a large percent of the influx of new members. <br /><br />Another aspect of this community that I&#039;ve noticed has been steady decline of community leadership and regular input. The early mods like Nomad (among others) and the more social captain fostered a strong sense of community around here. At least they did so in my mind. <br /><br />Certainly I don&#039;t mean for that to be a criticism toward any current or former individual. Perhaps I&#039;m just no longer noticing it the way I used to.&nbsp; All I know is that I missed&nbsp; that former sense of leadership and promotion of importance of community valuing <br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve noticed a striking drop in what used to feel like a sense leadership and overall content on the forum. <br />This change, perceived or real, may well be natural course of this&nbsp; &quot;epiphany of the double edged sword parable.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, I appreciate this thread and hope to see more leadership type posts like this from you and other &quot;informed&quot; OG members... It&#039;s&nbsp; obvious that a badge doesn&#039;t create a leader out of every crew member. And that some choose self-serving crusades over serving the best interest of the community as their priority. <br /><br />I respect your views as a vendor toward the community and actually recognizing and responding to it&#039;s pulse. I believe that attitude, by vendors and buyers alike, is also essential to the longetivity of SR and anonymous vending in general.<br /><br />I hope that with time, we progress as an enlightened community in a way that dulls the sword, even if it&#039;s one edge at a time. At present, I&#039;m too high to ponder resolution of the epiphany.<br /><br />PS I hope you successfully reclaimed certain funds bizzack. Never heard the update promised. ;)
