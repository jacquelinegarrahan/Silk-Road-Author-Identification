				There&#039;s been a lot of speculation as to weather or not they will be attempting to round up the customers of the road in addition to the vendors. My close friend has been using the road since June, has bought cumulatively 500 grams of molly, a few thousand xanax, and perhaps a pound of shrooms, as well about 130 hits of acid. He recently received a letter in the mail from &quot;the xanax king&quot; requesting he contact him at a gmail account for continued business. The next day, he received a phone call from the number 212-121-212, with someone asking him about his computer. The day after that, he&#039;s notified of a package being received at his drop point, which he had already burned. He told me he didn&#039;t always use PGP, certainly a foolish choice on his part, but how stupid are these pigs to think he&#039;d ever pick up a packae at the mailbox after the road was busted or try to contact a vendor through gmail? <br /><br />My point is this; he may have made some mistakes in his process, and he may have bought more than many of the accounts on here, but it probably wasn&#039;t the MOST that was bought by a long shot, and they are very much coming for him. Will they do the same for any person who&#039;s ever bought an 8th of shrooms or a ten strip of acid? Perhaps not. But if you&#039;ve made more than 2 orders, I&#039;d highly recommend you take stock, because anyone who thinks time or money are an issue for the DEA doesn&#039;t understand how this country really works. I&#039;m saying this because my friend was nervous for the last week and a half wondering if they&#039;d go after customers or not, and now he knows. Now you know, and hopefully, will plan accordingly. The best method for trying to stomp this &quot;issue&quot; out at the source is to hold as many people possible involved at any level accountable, and I have no doubt that is what they will try to do.

				1st of all your friend is a dumb ass for not always using PGP.<br /><br />2nd they&#039;re not going to waste any resources on trying to bust customers hahahaa!! that&#039;s the most ridiculous shit I&#039;ve read this morning, UNLESS vendors are careless with stealth, and a package gets intercepted, then all you have to do is not sign for it, and use PGP PEOPLE COME ON!!<br /><br />Last but not least, your story is bullshit to me, are your just really high on something, stop spreading fear dude, and chill out.

				I agree that everyone should use PGP, but I think it&#039;s become&nbsp; pretty apparent that a lot of people didn&#039;t.&nbsp; I have no intention of spreading fear, but between this forum and the subreddit, I&#039;ve seen a lot of people very nervous and unsure as to weather or not they should prepare themselves. The point of this post to tell people that, yes, they should at least be prepared. Whether or not they wanna take the advice is another story. <br /><br />Perhaps YOU should stop spreading disinformation in convincing people that shit is fine. There&#039;s a post confirming that other people have gotten the same letter from XK I refereed to in my OP, and the decoy package pretty much proves that the feds are at least watching the customers. I can&#039;t say I know what their next move will be, or if there will be one, but if that&#039;s not already enough for patrons to start being cautions (not paranoid), then enjoy the US legal system. <br /><br />~DFG~

				Are you kidding me?&nbsp; They do not and never will have enough resources to go after all the buyers.&nbsp; &quot;Your friend&quot; sounded very stupid to buy all of that and still not use PGP.&nbsp; Almost sounds like &quot;They&quot; wanted to get caught.&nbsp; Do you really think they are going to come after 1 million buyers on here and the 300,000+ users in the US?&nbsp; NO!!!&nbsp; Besides they go after the big fish, DPR and the vendors.&nbsp; Besides the damage has already been done to us by seizing the site.&nbsp;

				@DFG: i cant help but compare you to some independent, unsuccessful, low-budget tabloid who comes up with titles, like the one you used, to try to bring up their number of viewers<br />your &#039;friend&#039; is not a regular buyer, he sounds like a small time dealer. he also sounds almost as retarded as &#039;simple jack&#039; in the movie tropic thunder. buying those amounts and not using pgp...geez!<br />as mentioned above, stop spreading the paranoia. if you&#039;re genuinely interested in disclosing cases like this one, it would be best if you did not mislead and scare people.<br /><br />on another hand, thanks for sharing this. any story is good feedback for all<br />

				One problem is SR buyer history which shows how much you spent and which items your purchased. A lot of people were buying bulk amount of drugs for resell and a lot of vendors were sending tracking #&#039;s that weren&#039;t encrypted, not to mention two top vendors on here (Nod, XTCexpress) were busted and probably have data that they can link your address to your buyer account, who knows how many more vendors are getting busted. The feds can than give that info to local LE, who then will get wire warrants (phone records, txt msg, ISP logs), tail you, and eventually a search warrant.<br /><br />Vendors could have buyer information and not even know it, it could still be in their printer cache, or if saved, the file is still recoverable if deleted, also the fbi, dea is known to use keyloggers.<br /><br />They can also probably associate your account with your deposit address, trace that back to your localcoins escrow/bitcoin vendor, of course they&#039;ll give up the transaction data, and all banks have surveillance cameras catching you making a deposit.
