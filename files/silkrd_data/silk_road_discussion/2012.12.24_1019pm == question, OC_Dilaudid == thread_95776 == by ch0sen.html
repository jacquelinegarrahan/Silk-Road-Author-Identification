				I used to a few years back have a rough OC habit.&nbsp; 4 OC 80&#039;s per day...<br /><br />These days I dabble here and there with small amounts of things.&nbsp; Got a little desoxyn from SR because I always wanted to try that.<br />It made me remember why I stopped doing speed all those years ago.&nbsp; I think I just burned out on the stuff.&nbsp; I mean I like it<br />but I think I was more addicted to the old P2P speed and that rush than I ever was to speed itself.&nbsp; The glass stuff never did it for me.<br /><br />So now I have a few successful orders completed.&nbsp; I was thinking of trying hydromorphone.&nbsp; I have never done heroin.&nbsp; Well, heroin proper anyways.<br />I really liked the feeling of the OC&#039;s.&nbsp; Is there any other opiate that compares to the high of OC?&nbsp; Another one I liked was mixing hydrocodone and percosets.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can anyone offer any suggestions as to what might be a good sample?&nbsp; I just want a little taste.&nbsp; I went down the road and<br />made it back lucky for me.&nbsp; Once in a while I like to treat myself to the old memories.<br /><br />Just askin others who have more experience than me.&nbsp; Anyways, Merry X-Mas all and have a great new year!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Your in luck my man cause i Have had the same OC habbit and also after that went on to Hydromorphone aka Dilly&#039;s aka daladid..&lt;&lt;Or however its spelt.. First off let me say if you sniffing them, then NO you really dont get much from it, but to I&#039;V them is HANDS DOWN better than a OC.. If your sniffing only, i would recomend Roxy&#039;s 30mg.. If you need any details or specifics let me know..

				Thanks man.&nbsp; No, I do not IV anything anymore.&nbsp; I used to be the person that would tell you you&#039;re wasting it by snorting it,&nbsp; but I just<br />cannot take those types of risks anymore.&nbsp; I shot more speed than I can even remember.&nbsp; At 90 lbs and in the hospital, well it was time to say <br />goodbye.<br /><br />I did try roxies but it took a few of them to get a buzz.&nbsp; I never did figure out that whole tolerance thing.&nbsp; Does it go away<br />after a while or will I always have a high tolerance?&nbsp; Also, downers never took me down.&nbsp; Only uppers.&nbsp; Probably why I liked speed so much.<br />Downers give me that warm feeling and everything but I have never slept or anything like that.&nbsp; Speed would always completely relax<br />me and have me laid back....<br /><br />Roxies are really pricey because everyone wants them now that OC&#039;s are gone.&nbsp; Opana is hydromorphone right?&nbsp; And Dilaudid...<br /><br />

				No Opana is Oxymorphone...Daladid is hydromorphone..2 totally different drugs.. The new Opana SUCK!! they have that same shit that they did to OC&#039;S with them now.. But there are a few vendors on here with the Old Opana;s and those are much better. Im not sure what to suggest for you if your just taking them by mouth.. I end up sniffing all my pain pills that are able to.. BTW there is a new OC vendor on here that HAs OXY super super cheap!! Go look in the product offers forum, i forget his name but it should be a topic there on the first page.. Only thing is he gets 20mg and 40mg and instead of OC they say&nbsp; EX for = export.. Purdue it seems only decided to fuck the americans with that OP bullshit..

				Try plugging if you&#039;re up for that kinda shit. It&#039;s a good way to use OC&#039;s and even hydromorphone if you&#039;re not IV&#039;ing anymore.

				I&#039;m interested in this topic as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m like the OP.&nbsp; Back in the day i loved the OC&#039;s.&nbsp; I have checked out some vendors on here that have them, but damn the price.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been buying a lot of 10/325 norcos on here.&nbsp; Trying to get the most hydro with the least acety.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking to try something new, but the prices are so damn high on opiates i don&#039;t want to screw up.&nbsp; So Roxy 30mg sounds like the way to go.&nbsp; If you know any good vendors with good pricing could you post it here or PM me?<br /><br />BTW:&nbsp; My favorite way of ingesting is snorting.&nbsp; That&#039;s why i&#039;m looking because im not sure the ole sniffer can take the norcos much longer.

				Agreed.&nbsp; The prices are really high so I need to be careful about my choices.&nbsp; Especially because I do it very rarely.<br /><br />Not pluggin anything.&nbsp; Just cannot go there.&nbsp; That&#039;s why the old formula is valuable.&nbsp; Can be snorted.&nbsp; <br />Chewing them works ok if you can handle the taste.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; Maybe I will try the dilaudid.&nbsp; Or just save and spring for an OC80 or 4...<br /><br />

				Well i grew up on the original Formula OC so im gonna say Oxy.. I never really liked the roxy&#039;s very much there ok but u need a couple. <br /><br />I love and Miss Oc&#039;s a LOT! Iv seen a few vendors with them but they are all 1 dolla r MG excpect some new guy thats come on the scene, iv spoke to him and seems like a good dude just no transactions yet, His name is &#039;Expurdue&#039; Like i said he doesnt have any transaction but killer deals on Original Oc&#039;s... <br /><br />As far as the question about your snorter, It not good for us to be putting any of these meds up it, but some things are worse than others, and Norco&#039;s are cut with Tylanol or asprin i cant remember which , so like i said what your doing is like taking a OC AND A asprin crushing them an snorting it.. I cant Imagine how massive and Big those lines are bro.. Pain meds do have long term damage on the Liver but i would think you would really have to have a nice intake amount, but then again it could be just all on the individual and how the body breaks it down. I would say if your gonna keep the sniffer in working order try not to put asprin and Tylanol up it..

				The norcos are cut with Tylenol.&nbsp; You should never have more than 4000 mg of Acetaminophen in a 24 hr period.&nbsp; Above that it becomes toxic for your liver.<br />The yellow norcos 10/325 were always my favorite but became hard to find.&nbsp; 10 hydrocodone / 325 APAP.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Sniffing Activis generic Opana is the easiest and better than heroin in high IMHO&gt;.<br />I do not advocate iving and oxymorphone they all have deadly fillers that unless you are chemist you should not mess with any extractions. I myself have stopped IVing oxymorphone even though I&#039;m very informed and great at extraction. Sniffing is just as good as IV just takes 5 minutes longer for onset.

				I bought a stop sign 15mg opana a few weeks back an was surprised it didnt do much of anything.. I use to love sniffing the 40mg ones.. Iv only I&#039;v the 10mg opana, the red looking ones and then the ones Poopjerk and Hatter have which i must say i think is a waste of money cause to me it did not seem worth it or very strong.. K4-K8 great to Iv and about the best thing iv ever injected, but Even now i have to do 3 or 4 at a time.. I guess im just burnt out on opiates from over the years.. I use to eat a whole 100mg Fent patch with the Gel back when i had Access to them.. I would get a Box of 5 for free of eaither 50 mg or 100mg, and they were great but damn dangerous, i wish i still could get them cause how much they go for alone would be worth getting on here for 3 boxes a mnth, which is only 15 patches but Man the money !! I use to buy the Loli&#039;s for 40bucks, sometimes i would trade 100mg patches for 80mg oc&#039;s

				Oc has longer halflife than dillies and the morphones have a rapid tolerance effect.<br /><br /><br />So Yes OC are available in most countries generally OC&#039;s come from mexico now to NA but they are limited to just south of the border.<br />I&#039;d say heroin would be a good place to go before getting miz=xed up in morphones.<br /><br /><br />Opanas can be prepped against the time release but it takes more time than most are willing to wait. With opna nasal is 4 x more bioavailable than oral.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad<br />

				Oc&#039;s iv just recently found out the ones from Mexico,brazil and other places lke that actualy have on them (EX 20MG) OR EX 40) Meaning Export then the MG of pill.. I never knew that before, i thought it was at one point in the USA just OC and the generic that were made said ABG then the MG.. Now we have OP fucking BULLshit!! Im&nbsp; gonna be buying some Oc&#039;s first of the year i havent had a real oxy in years.. I got 5 OP 80mg a week or so ago and I filed them down into a fine pwder then put them in the Oven til Light golden brown then to The freezer and then up my nose.. Which i was not Impressed by at all.. So its time to just say fuck it and spend 150 bucks on 2 80mg pills or get 5 of the 40mg EX..

				FYI regarding oxys: The Canadian federal government recently decided (Nov 28/2012) to allow the production of generic Oxycontin. We&#039;re talking about the ORIGINAL OC/CDN tablets NOT the newer OP/NEO tablets. I don&#039;t know if any have appeared on the market yet but the next few months should be very interesting.

				Ewwww I can&#039;t imagine snorting all that APAP.&nbsp; Yeah, look for something that is free of APAP if you are going to be snorting, definitely. <br /><br />But yeah, anon is right, snorting dilaudid is a waste, I don&#039;t like plugging them either.<br /><br />OC is good plugged.&nbsp; I quit opiates a few years back, but when the old opanas were around, they were REALLY good sniffed.&nbsp; I was IVing everything at the time, and I still got REALLY REALLY high sniffing the old opana 40&#039;s.&nbsp; I read somewhere that bio-availability of Opana was LESS when plugged, but I was never able to verify if that was true or not.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve also bought the Opana 10&#039;s from the same vendor anonaddict cites, and IV&#039;d (first time I&#039;d done anything other than suboxone in a LONG time) and was surprised by how weak it felt. <br /><br />IMO, it&#039;s hard to match the different buzz that comes from different opiates, so if you like the OC buzz, you might be best off sticking to OC.<br />

				IMO MORPHINE SUCKS, IV SNORTED THE PILLS, THE LIQUID, INJECTED THEM, I JUST HATE THEM THEY MAKE u feel groggy ..<br /><br />Oc Or Dalaudid anyday for me.. <br /><br />The worst withdrawls would be from METHADONE!!! ITS LAST OVER A MONTH it gets in your bones.. Iv been on opiates 10+ years and only time i would do morphine is if i was sick and nothing was around.<br /><br />The 200 green ones were decent.. Fentynal is very hard to get off of also and its way stronger than Morphine

				FYI<br />Generic versions of the original OC/CDN Oxycontin are now available here. AFAIK they&#039;re *identical* to the original tablets. While any pharmacy can order them most are scared to. Not seen any on the street yet though I&#039;m sure someone is working on it.

				Expurdue the Venor does have the best prices, for 20mg and 40mg..We have spoke and were trying to work it out where soo many OC&#039;s will already be in he states ready to be shipped..<br /><br /><br />The only diffrence in his OC they are the original,same color size shape everything.. But when purdu sends their Oc to places like Mexico,Purto rico,Brazil etc etc they stamp them <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EX 20 OR EX 40&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EX=EXPORT same drug just different stamp..<br />&nbsp;<br />Now when in the USA we had non BULLSHT OP VERSION we could get the same kind that said OC but intead said ABG then the MG and they were much cheaper and did the same exact thing. I thought years ago when i first saw a 80mg CDN it was a fake.lol.. Did not know they were from Canada. <br /><br />Dilly&#039;s are damn good to IV Nomad..Have u had the orange ones by purdu? I get a scrip for them every month and i normally get the white ones that say M-4, but i went to a diffrent pharmacy this month cause my normal didnt have my damn Methadone, glade though cause i got the wonderful Dilly&#039;s by Purdu ..They didnt have 4mg so they ened up giving me 120 2mg to = my normal amount in 4mg...Which i was pissed cause 2mg SUCK!!! But to my surprise this Orange P-2 WERE GREAT!!!<br /><br />NOW TO THE GUY WHO SAID HES GETTING ROXI&#039;S BUT IS NEW TO THEM, JUST CRUSH THEM DOWN REALLY WELL AND SNIFF THEM BRO!!! I WOULD SAY DO 2 AT A TIME,BUT IF YOUR NEW TO PAIN MEDS STARTWITH ONE.. IM 10 YEAR OPIATE VET BROTHER IT TAKES ALLOT FOR ME TO GET RIGHT!<br /><br />I hve found BY FAR THE BEST for a long time opiate user, now Fentanyl patches and Lolipops are great!!! but i got from Mrdutchguy PURE FENT POWDER the other day and MY GAWD!!!!! I ONLY DID I LITLE BUMP AND IT KNOCKED MY DICK IN THE DIRT!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;GAWD THAT SHIT IS GOOOD..&nbsp; I had to be super careful cause i IV and I dont have a pair of freaking 500 to 1000 dollar microgram scales so i had to just start super super small nd than GAWD I DID....<br /><br />I have a friend in AUS who sends me OC&#039;S the real ones, It pisses me off everywhere but the USA GETS OC BUT US!!! Anyway she sends me a mix of 20mg and 40mg she doesnt take and has about 100 saved up and is gonna get them from her doc 3 more times.. We just decided to send 25 to 35 at atime in case AUS customs got them we wouldnt loose them aalll.. BUT MY POINT, I took 2 40mg pills crushed them down very fine and added a line of fent in the OC.. To make it stronger and so i would hopefully do less per shot and make a 80 last.<br /><br />well it did make i stronger but did no make it last longer..lol.. They say or its rummer some Heroin is cut with FENT...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I use to east a whole 100mcg patch at a time, this was before i knew anything about them...I loved the Lolipops though, I actually found 1 400mcg pop the other night and it was a Raspberry flav, guy was new so i hoped no one saw til i got my coins yesterday not 2hr after i saw it was gone,,lol ffs!!&nbsp; &nbsp;The only other guy with Pops r 1600mcg and like 200+....

				I love the 30mg IR Oxys, but they are so fucking expensive I almost never buy them anymore.&nbsp; I&#039;m fucking allergic to the Norco 10/325s, and have a few extras.&nbsp; The Tylenol in those is not bad; someone was saying that he was taking ten.&nbsp; The maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is 4,000mg, so if you&#039;re under that, and you&#039;re not taking anything else that contains acetaminophen, you should be fine.&nbsp;
