				A vendor sent me my tracking number with a note saying &quot;DON&#039;T USE TOR TO TRACK YOUR PACKAGE, THE PACKAGE WILL BE FLAGGED BY USPS.&quot; Is this true? I never have before used Tor to track my packages so I&#039;m not worried or anything but I&#039;ve been using SR for a few months now and was surprised to be hearing this only now. Is this common knowledge? If not it should be.

				I urge vendors not to provide their customers with tracking numbers for a number of reasons. The main one is they check it every 10 minutes like if it will make the package go faster.<br /><br />If you really have to check up on your package you can use TOR but make sure to use a third party site like packagemapping.com

				I&#039;ve looked at tracking numbers from TOR, and the packages all made it to their destination. Ironically the only package that I&#039;ve shipped and never arrived was on without a DCN. Still, I&#039;ve only been around for a a few months as a vendor so maybe they&#039;re watching me now. My question is how do they know it&#039;s the TOR network someone uses to check the DCN.&nbsp; I&#039;m paranoid enough that I won&#039;t do it again though. At least I see why to not give DCNs out to customers though. Although If LEO bought from you he would get the DCN on the package anyway.<br /><br />[The reason vendors didn&#039;t like to give them out originally is because it would give the time and zip code(the actual office) the vendor went to ship the package.

				I don&#039;t know the technical reasons but I&#039;ve always been told by people that know a lot more than I do to never track packages by tor. In fact, most vendors will only do a track for you like once or twice and only after a certain period of time for this reason. I guess&nbsp; U.$PS can somehow log certain IP addresses that are suspicious (probably ones that come from the same exit node or something) and flag you, and thus your packages are more likely to be inspected, but I dunno. <br /><br />Isn&#039;t it a good idea to check tracking numbers very sparingly,if at all?

				So like I said I&#039;ve checked DCN using TOR, nothing got flagged. Perhaps I was just lucky I don&#039;t plan on doing it again. <br /><br />My concern now is what information can be gathered from the DCN. if LEO orders a package from you he gets the other half of the DCN tag on the envelope or package. Can LEO get the exact time and place of mailing and get security tapes from the post office? If so what can they do with that?

And then you would see when it passed through the sort facility for that city. You could then see when it arrived in the sort facility for Miami and then you would see out for delivery. You would not see that your package is in say &quot;Texas&quot;or other places it might be like you would if you had actual tracking like Fedex uses. So yes you can get more information then just time delivered. It all depends on a lot of factors. But it is not tracking. It is for confirmation of delivery. But thank you for your educated post. <br /><br />Now let me address your first post. In case anyone is to lazy to look it is this.<br /><br /><br />You are a complete idiot.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the list of names above you also listed TOP VENDOR------LOL-----Someone who has sent more packages, then you will ever receive!!&nbsp; &nbsp; To Funny------your so new, you do not even recognize it.<br /><br />Did not read your whole post, no need too!!&nbsp; &nbsp;You gave me a good laugh this morning!!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Peace, and sorry about the idiot!!<br /><br />So I am a complete idiot because I give you information that is actually the truth? And because I say that Delta is wrong in this case and since with your logic Delta is a top vendor he can&#039;t be wrong? Also that is SO FUNNY? If you found that funny you actually need to get out of the house more. And you assume I am so new that I didn&#039;t know Delta was a top vendor and I didn&#039;t even realize&nbsp; it? Would that title SR VENDOR below his name give it away. Or do you actually believe that I just signed&nbsp; up for a forum account 30 minutes before I posted and I decided to post in this thread by luck as I was just dying to post something? Did it ever occur to you( if you were not laughing to hard) that maybe I read this and I actually knew the correct answer and so I decided to post the answer because I saw so many incorrect postings. And I realized it was just the typical poster in this forum that actually does not know but they read somewhere or someone told them so they then re-post it as factual. Could that be why I posted ? <br /><br />You did not read my whole post but that post gave you a good laugh?? Because I was too new to realize Delta is a top vendor and mailed more packages then I have seen...hmm. You sure of that?<br /><br />Also I didn&#039;t disrespect anyone...including top vendor Delta. I just said he is incorrect.<br /><br />Also you should have read the whole post. If you did, you would then be educated as to why vendors should never give out dcn&#039;s to buyers. And it has nothing to do with checking them on TOR.<br /><br />Also I read the supporters. Of course your package came. That is what is supposed to happen. And checking from tor does nothing to the safety of the package. I hope you all are not dying of laughter over my hilarious post.<br />

				Not all users of SR are American. Even if USPS does not log anything, this is probably not true of all other delivery services out there.<br /><br />Any package tracking website will log IP addresses of visitors. Most, if not all websites do this. Tor exit node IP&#039;s are all known. In the current Tor implementation they have to be in order for you to be able to use them (it&#039;s done behind the scenes) It would be trivial for any agency to access the log files of their server and search for any hits from any tor exit node, and flag that visit as suspicious. This would then require manual intervention, to locate the package and investigate it. Although this seems unlikely to be done at this point, I would bet that statistics would be in LE&#039;s favor, the majority of packages that are checked on with tor contain contraband. <br /><br />Just because it is not publicly stated that a service is logging your IP address when you enter information does not mean it is not done. I would assume the opposite is true. <br /><br />Why? It&#039;s an easy flag that something is up with this package. Whether or not this is being done, only time will tell. But why give them that opportunity? I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s only a matter of time before LE starts grasping at straws to bring SR or it&#039;s user base down, in any way possible.<br /><br />The best way IMO would be use a proxy in your area and connect through tor, to the proxy, and then check your tracking number. There is no list of all proxies that could be used, although proxies are detectable they are very common and typically are not checked for unless you&#039;re on a website that is abused (spam). Most proxies come and go in days/weeks/months.<br /><br />The reason for not giving out a DCN is a very valid one, although all the details LE would need to find the originating post office are on the package when it arrives. Hopefully sellers are using disguises when mailing parcels.<br /><br />Remember, anonymity&nbsp; &amp; safety should be everyone&#039;s #1 priority - not convenience and service guarantee. I&#039;d much rather get scammed then get busted.<br />

It is insane to even believe that! And in fact lets assume you are correct....Nah I can&#039;t go there because it is just totally crazy to think they would. My god people the USPS has no resources or reason to do that. lol So someone wanting to know where a package is means they are doing something suspicious?

It makes no difference. Just understand that USPS DCN are not tracking and not reliable EXCEPT for what they are intended for... to confirm a package has in fact been delivered to said Zip code. <br /><br />The reason vendors didn&#039;t like to give them out originally is because it would give the time and zip code(the actual office) the vendor went to ship the package. And the theory was if you gave them out then the customer would know(LE) only minutes after you were there the time you went. Then they could contact the post office and actually get the tape and see who shipped the package(s) as the tracking does lead back to the post office and in the post office what lane and what agent you went to. Then they could also get the receipt and see other zip codes you shipped to and actually intercept the packages. That is the real truth. Not anything to do with using USPS.com to track or using TOR to access the website.<br /><br />That is the reason a vendor should not give out the DCN except to SR staff. Also there is nothing the buyer could do with the number other then look it up and see when it was last logged. And if the vendor was/is smart they actually don&#039;t get the DCN scanned in the system. As that way it is only scanned when it is delivered and hence you have confirmation it was delivered! Not confirmation that it was shipped. And that is what 99% of customers want the DCN for. To see if it was actually shipped. And of course they want this info now after 2 days! Because they spend there time waiting for there package reading all this bullshit in here.<br /><br />I would bet 99% of vendors did not know THAT is the reason NOT to give out the DCN.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Believe it / not,it sound make sense.

Then you say you did then you say you didn&#039;t mean what you said you meant.All this because you were laughing so hard because I didn&#039;t know Delta was a top vendor.<br /><br />Oh and because you were coming down from a high and this is to deep for you in the AM. Then you say you wont apologize as if I asked you to! I didn&#039;t.And i proved not only do you have no sense of humor. Instead of giving advice and using&nbsp; words you don&#039;t know the meaning of, take your own advice and sober up completely before you post.<br /><br />You want to give a +1 to a person that admits he has no idea but decided to be junior Pine and give us a dooms day report. And tells us all to spend 45 min to log in to check a package. Because not everyone is in USA and he is sure another site logs IP address...Why? So that they can flag them! Of course!<br /><br />Thanks Joy for actually seeing that I was really talking about why vendors should not give DCN&#039;s and I have never seen 1 vendor actually know. Well I have seen 1 vendor.&nbsp; ;D<br />

				As a vendor with the best shipping anonymity in the biz- all I can say is, release the tracking number at your own risk- <br /><br />Unless the customer makes a claim, they dont get the tracking number, if they really really got to have it- they can pay an extra 10-15$ to get it up front.

You are doing exactly what you have been complaining about in this thread. If you are shipping packages in person on CCTV, you are doing it wrong.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe that checking your tracking from Tor is going to compromise your package or even your destination address necessarily. The issue is that it provides LE with easy to access information to help break down the safeguards of anonymity we have in place here. And all because the buyer was too lazy to go through a third party tracking site or use a web-based proxy to check. This actually takes no additional time or effort on their part.<br /><br />And it is true, at least for USPS domestic deliveries, a DCN is pretty much useless for anything but delivery confirmation.<br /><br />The security of our transactions is based on the privacy of Tor and encrypted messaging combined with the massive scale of the postal system in which we hide. The addresses of Tor exit nodes are publicly accessible, this is how Mt. Gox flags Tor-checked accounts. If a federal agency decided that they wanted more information on SR transactions, it is not a difficult step to reach out to their government&#039;s postal service and request all of the shipments checked directly through Tor.<br /><br />You are suggesting to users that we just give up a significant layer of anonymity we get from the postal system and provide outsiders with information needlessly. I think that even your other suggestion of calling the 800 number is actually a far better idea than this. This is why vendors should not give out tracking numbers.<br />

Even if USPS does not log anything, this is probably not true of all other delivery services out there.<br /><br />Any package tracking website will log IP addresses of visitors. Most, if not all websites do this. Tor exit node IP&#039;s are all known. In the current Tor implementation they have to be in order for you to be able to use them (it&#039;s done behind the scenes) It would be trivial for any agency to access the log files of their server and search for any hits from any tor exit node, and flag that visit as suspicious. This would then require manual intervention, to locate the package and investigate it. Although this seems unlikely to be done at this point, I would bet that statistics would be in LE&#039;s favor, the majority of packages that are checked on with tor contain contraband. <br /><br />Just because it is not publicly stated that a service is logging your IP address when you enter information does not mean it is not done.

				I agree with ACE here, I said that tracking through Tor may not compromise your package but I am not saying it will or won&#039;t for sure. I can&#039;t see how Keith Sweat would either unless he is a LE liaison for the post office, hence the spreading disinformation as truth.<br /><br />The point is, exposing specific packages as SR related is pretty stupid when there is absolutely no need to do so. Yes, Tor has many other uses outside of SR around the world ... but I would say that vast majority USPS tracking of domestic packages from Tor exit nodes is for criminal activities surrounding illegal items shipped through federal post. So if giving up general information about SR doesn&#039;t scare you as a user, then you should at least be concerned about protecting your own receiving addresses as that information can be potentially compromised as well.<br /><br />If you have gone through all the trouble of using BTC and Tor to protect your identity, why not spend 10 seconds to use a third party site or web-proxy to see information that really has no benefit anyways?

				If I were vending on SR, I would be hesitant to give out DCNs/tracking numbers because some buyers are idiots and will call repeatedly about their packages/bring attention to themselves. I recently saw someone posting in a thread in the Rumor Mill talking about how he tried calling ISC several times about his package to see where it was and asking if it had been confiscated...yes there are buyers that are that retarded.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe checking out your tracking/DCN via USPS&#039;s website through TOR will have any effect on what happens to your package but I do know that buyers will do stupid things like the above example which can possibly cause problems.

So what is your evidence to dismiss the fact that the USPS does not track IP addresses? Have you worked on their servers? Have you accessed their databases and seen that IP addresses aren&#039;t logged? Until you can prove the fact more than just stating you know it and by linking a fact that DCN&#039;s can be tracked back to the source (a very commonly known fact) to try and give your self a false sense of knowledge, then your post is just as un-validated as any other. <br /><br />I think it is just plain ignorant of anyone to dismiss this fact. Having done server and web development i know that many ordinary websites have an IP tracking database. Some store indefinite, some erase after X period of time. <br /><br />Now with Silkroad exploding in size and interceptions at borders increasing there is huge pressure on governments worldwide to stamp this activity out.

I think this thread would put many a stupid idea into LE&#039;s head! <br /><br />By jumping up and down and hiding behind the fact that DCN&#039;s can be traced back to the source of origin does not dismiss the possibility of LE searching through IP data to find vendors/buyers.
