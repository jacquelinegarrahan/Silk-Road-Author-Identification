				First let me say that I think the buyer stats is a great addition to SR, as I stated in a short post earlier in the thread.&nbsp; However, a possible negative for new sellers came to mind.&nbsp; Personally, when it comes to my money, I&#039;m not very &quot;adventurous&quot; to begin with.&nbsp; &nbsp;What I mean is, I&#039;m not very likely to place an order with a new seller with zero or very few transactions to begin with.&nbsp; But now with the buyer feedback system I&#039;ll probably be even less likely to place an order with a new seller in fear of damaging my buyer stats.&nbsp; I would think most reasonable vendors would keep in mind that &quot;shit&quot; does happen time to time and not freak out if there is 1 or 2 refunds in someones stats.<br /><br />How do other buyers feel about this?&nbsp; Would the new buyer stats addition affect your willingness to purchase from a new vendor on SR?<br /><br />What about sellers, how much stock are you going to put into the buyer stats?&nbsp; Will you likely cancel orders with just a few refunds, how many refunds to transactions percentage wise would make you think twice about dealing with a buyer?<br /><br />Take care,<br />fattysquirrel

				Silk Road - This is certainly a step forward for sellers on this site, but I think we need a similar step forward for buyers.<br /><br />As an example of a problem that needs to be solved, on 2/5 transactions so far on this website, I have had highly highly ranked 5-star vendors leave an order processing for &gt; 6 days, even after contacting them, all while watching them fulfill other orders both in feedback and on the forum. In both of these situations I canceled the order.<br /><br />IMO, the feedback system isn&#039;t cutting it to measure vendor quality. It seems like as long as an order arrives, people are strongly goaded into giving a vendor 5 stars. I see this all the time on the forums and the site - people say stuff like &quot;There is absolutely no reason not to give a 5 star review.&quot; This really hurts the ability to separate between great sellers and good sellers.<br /><br />If vendors are going to be able to discriminate based on these statistics, I would like to be able to see vendor statistics (like the number of times buyers have canceled on them / requested resolution / etc) in order to prevent myself from ordering from subpar vendors in the future.<br /><br />Thanks, and really appreciate the work you&#039;re putting into this site.<br /><br />Edit - P.S. - I was also wondering if the number of times you&#039;ve canceled orders is one of the statistics that sellers can see? In that case, it makes me even more upset to know that I will be punished for dealing with those sellers in the past.

				Congrats SR, You and your staff never cease to amaze me with this site. This a perfect solution for a buyer like me for my vendors. I also agree that we as buyers should have vendor stats along with the feedback profile. I made 11 transactions and a couple pending since joining a month ago and left 5 for 5 for all except 1 who advertised the brand name item and sent a foreign generic. I still gave him a 3 for 5 for shipping and packaging. I would not had to leave a poor feedback if there were more stats on the vendors because I would not have bothered to order in the first place. When you see a time stamp photo with the name brand and it&#039;s listed as the name brand and then receive a pakistani or chinese knockoff and then it&#039;s defended as just as good, doesn&#039;t cut it with me. I would rather avoid the purchase all together. Also I avoid international purchases, it&#039;s just my quirk, but that may change. I prefer buying within my country to help out this dismal economy.When the listing states ships from OZ to worldwide, then I have to take time out to contact the vendor to see if they ship from where I&#039;m at. Sometimes I don&#039;t get a responce for days when the vendor is AWOL. I think the ship from - ship to listing should be accurate. Other than those 2 points this site continues to be first rate.

				Okay I&#039;m repeating what I&#039;ve written in another thread about what should be included in buyer reviews. <br /><br />When it comes down to it, what you&#039;re expecting a buyer to do when he/she is giving/taking away stars based on &quot;quality&quot; is, in fact, &quot;opinion&quot;. Who is to say who has a better idea of chronic versus another? <br /><br />I think the forum is the PERFECT place for people to comment on the QUALITY of the seller&#039;s product versus taking away 1 or 2 stars because their &quot;product&quot; wasn&#039;t up to their &quot;par&quot;. <br /><br />Here&#039;s how I determine if I give a 5/5. <br />1) Did the seller ship it out within a few days of my &quot;add to cart?&quot; and note the &quot;in transit&quot;? <br />2) Did the seller respond to any questions I may have had in a &quot;timely&quot; manner (24 hours or less)? <br />3) Did the product arrive in a realistic time-frame based on the 411 they offer on the listing? <br />4) Was it packaged discreetly and fit in with the rest of my mail?<br />5) Was it what I asked for? (Not was it the best damned shit I&#039;ve ever had, but did it do the job??).<br /><br />It&#039;s the BUYERS job to go to the forums and consider whom he/she should buy on based on extensive reviews. We&#039;re not holding kiddy hands here. This is kindergarten. This isn&#039;t E-bay. There are scammers on here anyway, leaving their own feedback. So, I myself, do not rely on feedback on the seller&#039;s profile. I look to the forums, that involve more extensive detail.<br /><br />If I want to give details on preference of quality, or the extent of which I explain the quality of the product, I do so in the appropriate sections of the forum. Actually, FIRST, I let the seller know how I feel about it. In fact, I haven&#039;t talked trash except for a scammer. <br /><br />Considering the current process of the seller rating format, it&#039;s not right to act like an E-bay dickhead and give them 2/5 stars because YOUR opinion of what you think the quality of product should be, isn&#039;t what it is. <br /><br />And for that matter, I am still of the opinion that good buyers like myself, should be rated. That way the more experienced and veteran sellers can maintain relationships with buyers who know the deal. I immediately finalize if I trust the seller. I am discreet. I am kind. I give a few suggestions if necessary. And I communicate if necessary. Shit, someone send me 5 btc for being such a good HappyTree!

				I had to chuckle when I first logged onto SR today.&nbsp; I read the most recent feedback listed on the front page like I usually do and I see the following feedback for a quarter oz of marijuana:<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six gram quarter, good herb<br /><br />So this buyer was shorted roughly 15% of the product he purchased and he gives a 5/5?&nbsp; Now there could be multiple reasons for this seemingly crazy feedback, although when taken at face value it certainly is strait crazy IMO.&nbsp; Perhaps it&#039;s a simple typo?&nbsp; But being that the buyer actually spelled out the word &quot;six&quot; and didn&#039;t use a &quot;6&quot;, I find that highly unlikely.&nbsp; Maybe the buyer is just unaware of how much a quarter oz actually weighs, which is certainly possible.&nbsp; However again I find it unlikely that a person using the service of SR would not be aware of this.&nbsp; The buyer also may not be confident he properly weighed the product as well, and didn&#039;t want to dock the seller in case he did make a mistake.&nbsp; Clearly this is all just speculation on my part.<br /><br />If it actually is exactly what it says, and the buyer gave a perfect rating regardless of being shorted roughly 15% I&#039;m a bit dumbfounded.&nbsp; On a side note, it was for a vendor that is highly rated with many transactions, so personally I would dismiss something odd like this myself.&nbsp; I just thought it was interesting and pertained to the subject at hand.<br /><br />Take care,<br />fattysquirrel

				I like this idea a lot as I&#039;m proud of the way I conduct my transactions. Only thing is I usually only use the same 3-4 vendors and they would know they have a fair idea of my rep. It will however assist both buyer and seller when new to each other.

				what I meant was, I have 8 orders that I have already shipped before this system was implemented, and would like to see the buyer stats on those customers, but on the order screen, all I see is tx#, item, qty, buyer, auto finalize, cancel, reason.....but no buyer stats. I just want to check how likely those orders are to go to auto finalize or resolution...not that there is anything I can do about it now, but with the $2 drop in bitcoin today, I am worried what the future will bring. almost too nerve racking to sell using bitcoin and escrow with 18 days to auto finalize.

				Brock, I wouldn&#039;t finalize early just because you&#039;re in Australia. Especially living in a different country, the chances of your package being intercepted is far greater. I would just PM your seller that you live there, and generally it takes 18 days for packages to arrive. That being said, I have heard of some packages from US getting to Australia in 5 days, so I would see if there&#039;s an option for International Express shipping.

				The forums are where quality and more elaborations are discussed.&nbsp; All of the major vendors have at least one thread started on them with multiple participants.&nbsp; The thread in my forum signature has posts from at least 25 unique buyers, so anybody who has never done business with me can go there - every product I offer is covered and customer satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) with the transaction from start to finish is vented there. Even a separate rating for quality is going to have to be subdivided and customized for each product category.&nbsp; I think the forums are the best bet because people are allowed to vent to the good and bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feedback is fine, and as for product quality it&#039;s a subjective thing (although I&#039;m from Canada and our weed makes Amsterdam giggle like a 12-year-old schoolgirl ;).&nbsp; If you got sticks and stems, put that up there.&nbsp; If you got nice bud, put that up there.&nbsp; Pics help from a seller side, let customers know what they are buying.<br /><br />For funding your BTC account.&nbsp; If you buy stuff online more than just BTC and SR purchases, get a Liberty Reserve account.&nbsp; You can transfer to paypal.&nbsp; You can fund most BTC exchangers with it, it&#039;s very fast, and then you are only dealing with the clearing-house times in the actual BTC p2p network.&nbsp; Just keep a reserve of LR $ on hand.
