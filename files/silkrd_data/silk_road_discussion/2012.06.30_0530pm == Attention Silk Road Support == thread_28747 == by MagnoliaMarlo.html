				I noticed there was a thread regarding this issue in tech support- but it wasn&#039;t getting much attention. <br /><br />A few users including myself have not been able to access SR for the past 15 hours+, while a bevy of other US users have reported no problems. Has SR support recognized this issue and started working on it? Any type of time-frame? Any info would be much appreciated, and sorry if posting a similar thread in two locations is going overboard...<br /><br />MM

				I hadn&#039;t been able to log in until a few minutes ago and when I did I found the order I was logging in to resolve was auto finalized.&nbsp; Did you per chance have an order in this same state?&nbsp; Because I have only 8 transactions my auto finalize is now 32% from this. I&#039;m not sure how that will affect me going forward but it&#039;s pretty crappy.

				I haven&#039;t been able to access SR for the past hour or two. Tried connecting from various open wifi APs here in the US as well as through various bridges in different parts of the world. No dice.<br /><br />I am waiting on the status of an order I placed Thursday -- Still no word on whether or not it was shipped as the vendor hasn&#039;t been on since then. Perhaps he/she has been having trouble getting on SR as well, but for longer. Gonna pray that this is the case, and that they shipped my order already but couldn&#039;t mark it in transit ::crosses fingers::

				I haven&#039;t been able to access SR -connection timed out- in the last 24h. I was starting to seriously worry...&nbsp; but according to what you say at least the site isn&#039;t down.&nbsp; I wonder what the problem is tho, I know nothing about TOR but the problem can&#039; be related to your geographical location, or can it?

				If you were trying to give the vendor time for the package to arrive you should have done a resolve and added more days to the order before it would auto-finalize.&nbsp; Keep that in mind the next time your order gets to within 2 days of the finalize date and extend the date by 3 or 4 days.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered from a few places that can take 20-25 days to show so I always make sure I extend the date so I don&#039;t get caught in that position.
