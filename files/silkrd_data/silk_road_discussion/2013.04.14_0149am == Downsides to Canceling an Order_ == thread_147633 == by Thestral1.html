				Are there any downsides (monetary or statistical) to canceling an order? I&#039;ve been on the Road for a while, and have over a dozen orders (that have all gone off without a hitch), but I&#039;ve never run into this situation before...<br /><br />Brief synopsis: I placed an order (two actually, same vendor) on Monday, well before BTC hit its high point and the subsequent dive. It wasn&#039;t a large order by any means, and it was placed when the BTC value was around $160/USD.<br /><br />It&#039;s been stuck in the &#039;processing&#039; stage the ENTIRE time, and since the four day window is up I now have the option to cancel. The vendor has been checking in every day but hasn&#039;t replied to my messages. I even stated that I would transfer additional BTC to him as a show of appreciation and as a way to minimize any losses. I believe he&#039;s unhedged.<br /><br />The thing that burns me up, besides the promise of shipping within 48 hours, is that my messages are being ignored. I know this is a rough time for vendors; even though the value of BTC has risen steadily over the past weeks/months it must be difficult to have a deluge of orders arrive when the value of BTC peaks only to have the bottom drop out. Still, that&#039;s the name of the game, and I expect a little courtesy.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t think anything out of the ordinary would happen if I canceled, but I thought it best to ask the collective just to be on the safe side. Hopefully someone with more experience than I would be kind enough to share any valuable info in case I&#039;ve missed something...

				YOU WILL REACH YOUR DEMISE AND DESCEND INTO THE DEPTHS OF BMR!!!!!!!!!!!<br />canceling before it&#039;s shipped won&#039;t affect your stats. if it&#039;s unhedged you just get back whatever à¸¿ it was minus ~10%. it should say on orders whether escrow is $us or bitcoins. <br />i assume you checked the vendors not done a general update on their profile about their situation. their laziness in not shipping during the days before the crash would make me way less sympathetic towards the vendor tbh. completely up to you if you want to cancel or not though. your money.

				Thanks for replying, Ron. Yeah, I&#039;ve checked his profile every day and there are no updates. I still have a sliver of hope that he&#039;ll make good on the order &amp; that I can give him more of my business, I&#039;m just surprised at the &#039;burying head in the sand&#039; strategy. I&#039;ve talked to some members that have dealt w/ him a lot and I&#039;m not the only one being ignored.<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent a decent amount of money on the Road under more than one account, &amp; an experienced vendor should know that this is a sure-fire way to lose a lot of future business. If my order sits for too much longer and I don&#039;t hear back I&#039;ll have to cancel; while I won&#039;t like losing 10% it sounds a lot better than meeting my demise and descending into the depths of BMR...&nbsp; ;)

				no worries my winged chum. the blanket silence on his side is lame as. like i fully appreciate it must be a stressful situation for vendors not knowing if they&#039;re screwed for cashing out value but pretending nothings happening and not communicating doesn&#039;t seem in any way constructive. really unprecedented circumstances but appalling customer service, it&#039;s not like he&#039;s too busy packing orders to respond to messages or post an update. douche move. maybe he&#039;s hoping buyers will just cancel the orders themselves so they can&#039;t leave negative feedback. anyways hope you get it sorted and don&#039;t lose too much if you do have to cancel.

				Thanks for your advice Ron. That&#039;s exactly what&#039;s happening - leaving the order in limbo, with funds tied up, so that I&#039;ll eventually have to cancel. That way the buyer takes the monetary hit and can&#039;t leave feedback.<br /><br />I&#039;m giving the vendor another day to make things right (or at least return my messages). After that I&#039;ll take charge of the situation. It would be a shame if it came to that because I&#039;ll lose money in the present and he&#039;ll lose a lot of money in the future - from myself, friends, and others buyers. Hopefully he&#039;ll do the honorable thing.
