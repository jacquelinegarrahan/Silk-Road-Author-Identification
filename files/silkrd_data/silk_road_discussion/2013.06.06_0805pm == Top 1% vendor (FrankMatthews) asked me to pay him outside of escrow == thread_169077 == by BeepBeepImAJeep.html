			<dd class="postbody">
				So I messaged a top 1% vendor about a custom $1000 order, and he told me to remind him to set up a custom listing the next day. I reminded him the next day, he saw the message but didn&#039;t reply. I reminded him again the day after that and then he replied &quot;I think it&#039;s better you send the coins to my account and give me your address&quot;. He wanted me to just send the money directly to his account, isn&#039;t this shady as fuck? Which is very weird considering he&#039;s top 1%.

				I don&#039;t think this is the first time that the vendor does this, much probably.<br /><br />If it was the first time and he wanted to go around the rules he would have been much more attentive. Instead the sort of &quot;security&quot; with which he asked for something so grave as this makes me suppose that he has done something like this many times before and simply many people (we know that for drugs - especially H - many people do whatever it takes) agreed on doing things in his way.<br /><br />It is true that from an 1% vendor something like this shouldn&#039;t happen (above all because they have very good profits already) but it is also true that a vendor with that popularity can make users do things that they would never do with someone else just because they trust him much more.

				Yes, maybe Frank didnt act right in this occasion but fuck guys, he&#039;s always been an excellent vendor...i mean how is it that shittypersons like Italy-bulldog-lupen-etc -etc, well known scammers, are still there, even after numerous reports (at least from me...) ???, there are still items for sale that are completely fake, like those heroin pills wich you can find on the clearweb and are clearly fake!!! Stll there after months!! Those pills dont exist, period!<br />And in a moment you guys from SR banned a serious vendor like Frank for what, an out of escrow, which , ok, it might be against the rules but there&#039;s no evidence that it was ment to scam... as far as i know Frank never scammed anyone here, he might be long sometimes,i well know that, but he always came through so far...<br />just my 2 cents...<br />ppfld<br /><br />Go Frank we are with you!!<br /><br />

The point is that you don&#039;t know, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s important to act when someone pulls shady stuff like this. Sure it&#039;s possible that there was never any intention to scam but before we have the facts on the table, it&#039;s better to suspend the account to investigate further.<br /><br />In my opinion, a serious vendor would never break that rule and risks suspension just because he&#039;s too lazy to make a custom listing. I&#039;m not saying FrankMatthews is stupid, but what he did was pretty stupid. And I wouldn&#039;t want to trade with vendors who make mistakes like that, who knows what other mistakes they could make?

				Listen, i dont know how long you&#039;ve been &quot;on the Silk Road&quot;, from what i can see in your profile you look quite new .... i&#039;m using the Road almost since it first came out, well before Frank got in, and I can tell you that so far he&#039;s been probably the best vendor i dealt with, even if in a couple of occasion he tested my patience quite hard, i even thought he was taking the piss of of me, but deep inside i&#039;ve never doubt his honesty.<br />I mean before to point a finger so hard, check all his history in the forum and by the feedbacks and the only problems you can find will be related to orders in australia and new zealand that are well known for being bitchy...but you will find hundred, well probably thousands of very happy costumers...that should be enough to make you think twice...but actually you probably have done the right thing, you did it in good will, what i dont understand is the decision of SR staff to act so drastically... and i repeat, leave notorious scammers still free to steal and cheat on people.

A vendor so popular if for whatever reasons begin to turn into scamming can really commit a massacre. The other vendor you mentioned sure it&#039;s a liability, but it&#039;s nothing in comparison to someone with as much popularity as Frank turning wild. <br /><br />For this the admins acted very very quickly in this instance and they have done well to do so. It can also be a mistake done just for laziness and in good faith and not to cause harm but it was imperative given the popularity of the vendor to investigate on the issue really quick and prevent something that could turn into a bad situation very very fast just in case.<br /><br />In spiderman&#039;s docet: with great power comes great responsibility.

				With the volume of business and amount of SR commission he brings in suspect it will just be a slap on the wrist.&nbsp; Have to show that they are serious about the rules by suspedning account.<br />Pretty certain it was just laziness.&nbsp; Think $100 saving is pocket change for his company.
