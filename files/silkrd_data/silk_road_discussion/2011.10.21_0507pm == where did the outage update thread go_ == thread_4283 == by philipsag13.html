				Most likely because it was getting too long and convoluted. they want the next update to be readily available without having to look through all the nay-sayers and doubters on that thread. I feel like they are really close to putting it back up, and they may have gone with an idea of letting sellers on first to set up their listings so that when we buyers get on its business as usual.

You let all a us yaahooo buyers on at one time and the servers are going to get the shits again. SR&#039;s last edit said the light was getting bigger at the end of the tunnel. Let them do thier work and roll up an old school banana skin for kicks and giggles. Christ, it&#039;s only been a couple of days. Stop F5 ing every 2 seconds and get out of the basement and check the weather. It&#039;s a fucking beautiful day<br />where I&#039;m at...LMFAO.<br /><br />Bikerbum

				they should have just locked the thread instead of deleting it! they could always unlock it to post their updates, then lock it again to keep it from getting out of hand.<br />looks like Silk road was here on the forum about an hour ago (from his profile) so I would assume he has got a bit of sleep, and is back at it, and I guess we&#039;ll just have to wait for any more of an update.
