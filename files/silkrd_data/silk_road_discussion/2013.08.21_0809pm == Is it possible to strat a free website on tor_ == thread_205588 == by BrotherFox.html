				It&#039;s very difficult to do it securely if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing. It could actually be dangerous. I&#039;d recommend against it, or try to message Astor or at least look up his posts on the subject.

				I did it on a LAMP setup. It&#039;s easy. <br /><br />For some reason, though, they don&#039;t recommend using Apache2, but I haven&#039;t been able to get a straight answer from anyone at Tor as to why. <br /><br />Tor has a &quot;How-To&quot; guide on their site. But there is an even easier way than altering your Torrc file. Go into the Vidalia GUI ---&gt; Settings -----&gt; Services -----&gt; hit &quot;+&quot;, enter the target folder that will hold your private key (you have to create the folder) and the port you will be using. The TBB will automatically create a domain address and a private key. You don&#039;t even need to open the torrc. <br /><br />Just make sure you set a really strong password on PHP. You are more susceptible to hackers than gov intrusion. The biggest concern is someone gaining access to your entire system. Don&#039;t forget, you are on Tor and have no way to track hackers. <br /><br />Whatever you do, do not use Windows. <br /><br />Oh, and don&#039;t open &quot;localhost&quot; in a non Tor browser while you are hosting your site on Tor. Tor will drop it, and you will have to restart Tor. That&#039;s another reason to use a Linux OS. You won&#039;t have to restart your computer it. You can literally keep it running constantly, unlike Windows that you have to reboot 3 to 4 times a day. <br /><br />Oh, one more thing. Only run Tor as a client and not as a relay or exit node when hosting a site. <br /><br />Here is a link to a .pdf file. Shut down Tor when you before you open it. You should know how to handle pdf files. IDK why Tor would publish this in pdf. Oh well. <br /><br />https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf<br /><br /><br />BTW, here&#039;s my site. I&#039;m still kicking the tires and working out the bugs. <br /><br />http://lgboo2eqyx2pasch.onion/phpBB3/
