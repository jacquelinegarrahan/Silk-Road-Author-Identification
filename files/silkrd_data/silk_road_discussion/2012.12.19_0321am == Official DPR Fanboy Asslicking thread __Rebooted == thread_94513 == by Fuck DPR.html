				I&#039;m tired of you newbie faggots chiming in to say you have full faith in DPR, hes the man, he will fix all Long live DPR blah blah<br /><br />If you feel the need to profess your love to him through the medium of tongue in ass, please post it here in this thread, and leave the other topics for the people who don&#039;t see DPR as a hero, just some stupid fuk with a good idea but no idea how to implement it. If I had to guess the silk road crew is just DPR himself running it with an iphone 3gs, just not as secure is all. Would explain how fkn retarded this site has been lately. <br />

				Secretive, it was started because OP is pissed that most of SR is happier than he is. P.S dude...we&#039;re obviously both stalking the forums and feeling like replying to everything. Pretty sure I&#039;ve run into you 2 or 3 times tonight...HIII *waves* wanna come take ambien with me and smoke some weed and lots of cigarettes?? Bring drugs.<br /><br />A question for OP....why are you so mad? No really...if you honestly dislike someone and they way they do something, wouldn&#039;t you walk away? Like in real life...if your job sucks and you have other feasible means to live by, and quitting your current job would have no negative reactions....why would you stay and be angry?<br />Seems arbitrary.<br />Unless....you get satisfaction from being unhappy. In that case...kudos for portraying your happily angry self so well. Which...would actually make you just...happy. Hmmm...Feel free to call me a hippie, acid tripping, DPR ass-licking faggot. I&#039;m too young to be a hippie, I&#039;ve never done psychedelics, I don&#039;t lick ass-much less know what DPR&#039;s ass looks like, and that last one -faggot i&#039;ll take that. I smoke so many cigarettes, I might as well be one. Unless you&#039;re talking about americans who are gaY THEN WELL.....<br /><br /><br />TYPING THIS OUT IS INSANE, i EED WEED. WILL EDIT LASTER TO HELPMYSELF AND OTHERS UNDERSTNAD

YOU DON&#039;T AND LITERALLY NEVER WILL. People can go through rough patches in their lives when things temporarily overwhelm them and distract them from what&#039;s really important. Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones Ben. Put down your stones and piss off. While a mistake may have been made, kitkat82 has rectified things and moved on. Mind your own business and do the same champ!<br />Your again posting complete and utter BULLSHIT, nothing but baseless lies. Seriously, FUCK OFF and go away you little prick! Posting I&#039;m not able to construct a sentence is demonstrating your acute level of intelligence perfectly. Others can form their own opinions on what I&#039;ve posted, as others will regarding your posts.&nbsp; &gt;:(

You know what this dope is like, having posted previously in another thread, where he couldn&#039;t see a problem with kids being on here. The guy is seriously incapable of forming a rational view on anything. I would be one confused bloke if his theory was correct, but more importantly, it&#039;s way too much hard work which would result in absolutely no benefit to anybody. Guys a nutter!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ll still be here DICKHEAD, just steering well clear of you and anything you post. Oh yeah champ, I have finally cracked. Your so painful Ben, excruciatingly painful to be exact. I reckon you would give an Asprin a head ache. <br />P.S - In response to the post your about to write, I&#039;d like to post the following.<br /><br />FUCK OFF and leave me the hell alone. There are 2 or 3 threads you could perhaps post in on the forum (doubt it though now that I think about it) and if you keep working really hard, it won&#039;t be long before you can spell your own name, Ben.
