				I sent 9 BTC to my SR account.&nbsp; Time passed and the amount never appeared in my SR account.&nbsp; So for some stupid reason I clicked change address on SR site.&nbsp; Is my 9 BTC now lost or will it still appear in my SR account?&nbsp; Thank you!

				Don&#039;t worry, sometimes it can take a while for BTC sent to Silk Road to show up in your account. I seriously doubt they are lost, just give it some time. If they haven&#039;t shown up in a few hours then you should post again or send a moderator a message.<br /><br />

				Remember you can always use an old address if needed. (not a good idea at all for security reasons) but one time (Not on silk road) I copied and pasted the wrong number in, Luckily, it was an old number that I used for Mt. gox.. So it got there. <br /><br />No need to worry, and also remember there has to be 6 confirmations before&nbsp; it will show up. I have seen 6 take as little as about 1/2 hour to a couple hours. Thats why I always use a wallet. you can see it when it reaches the 6 mark....<br /><br />Dont ever just transfer from exchanger to SR.. (if you did, just dont do it again)

				Don&#039;t worry it can take a while.<br />blockexplorer.com will show the transfer after 1 confirmation (average 10 minutes, but an hour is not uncommon)<br />Silk Road uses more confirmations (6 maybe?) which on average is 1 hour but can me much much longer

				Indeed. Don&#039;t worry I have helped a few people who have had it not appear for 3 - 4 hours.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
