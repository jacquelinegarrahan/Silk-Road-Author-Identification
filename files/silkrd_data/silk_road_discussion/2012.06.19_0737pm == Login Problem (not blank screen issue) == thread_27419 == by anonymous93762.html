				Hi guys,,<br /><br />I realise this account is new but I&#039;ve been on SR for a while now and never got round to making an account for the forums. Anyway, the problem I&#039;m having is when I enter my login details the page just reverts me back to the login page, all of the informations fields are blank and no error messages.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried to make a new account which seemed to work but when I tried to login again after, the same thing happened, anyone have any ideas on how to solve this?<br /><br />Thanks

				Did you have the right address?<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />If it was anything other than that then say goodbye to any bitcoins on your account because you just gave your password to some phishers.

				Yep that&#039;s the link I&#039;ve been using. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t been on in about 4 weeks and maybe thought SR deleted accounts inactive for a certain period of time, but I created a new SR account and can&#039;t log on with that either.<br /><br />Does anyone know if it could possibly be a problem with TOR? or maybe the configuration of firefox?

				Try turning on Javascript and/or cookies if they are off. When I had them turned off it would do exactly what you said, just kept going back to the login screen. With them on it seems to work correctly.
