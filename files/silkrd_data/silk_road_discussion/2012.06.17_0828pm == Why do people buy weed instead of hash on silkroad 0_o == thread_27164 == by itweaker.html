				I do not understand the logic the hashish is same price some times cheaper then weed ex: 1g of hash avg price SR i saw was 2-3 btc vs 1g of dutch weed or w/e that is 4-5 btc. you would save so much bud and get so much more ripped bonging with hash&nbsp; 8) . Also it seems the bud is more expensive then street prices on SR , everyone shuld just stick to the hash x)

				As much as I love hash...it is not the same high as weed by a long shot. It is a completely different high and is much more forceful and much less relaxing. Smoking too much hash will put you into a tail spin (I&#039;ve done it before...especially eating hash brownies) whereas smoking too much weed just will make you a little anxious and more likely sleepy.<br /><br />Comparing hash to weed is almost (key word almost) like comparing JWH-018 to weed.

				There&#039;s something about burning the plant matter that is just so relaxing. <br />It hits the spot in a different way than concentrates do. <br />Mixing a couple good strains of bud can give you a more beneficial balance of effects to soothe yourself. <br /><br />Concentrates give a more intense high and can be very harsh. Sometimes I want that head spinning high where I feel stuck, but on the other hand, sometimes I don&#039;t want to be burning a bunch of plant material just to relax. Especially if someone&#039;s bud isn&#039;t cured properly and burns all black and lumpy. In that case, I&#039;ll leave some bud out to dry and just go for a some dabs of full melt to hold me over. So I like having both on hand to use at my leisure.<br /><br />Concentrates go a long way. I still have jars of waxes and oils that I&#039;ve had for months. All I&#039;ll need is a dab or two to clear my brain and numb my body a bit, but sometimes I really do not. <br /><br />

				None of the hash on here has the punch of good weed. Even when I&#039;ve bought the isolates in Amsterdam, which are 50 or 60 euros per gram, it&#039;s not the same effect, and that&#039;s ridiculously more powerful than anything on here, plus super expensive.<br /><br />Plus I like to vaporise, and that works great with weed. I can get away with using 1/3 of the amount I previously would when smoking daily.

				What about hash oil? I am a complete newbie when it comes to marijuana. Some time ago I bought some of Delta 11&#039;s brownies, which he says are made with potent hash oil. <br /><br />The first time I ate half, and I was pleasantly surprised that a few hours later I was having some odd thoughts, uncanny, hard to get a handle on them, with just the barest outlines of strange imagery.&nbsp; The second time I ate a whole one, and in a few minutes. It hit me much harder, with dizziness and heavy body load. And I had definite eidetic imagery, but different from mushrooms, and not as intense, but very definitely there.<br /><br />Is hash oil a very potent form of Haschish? Should I have eaten it over a longer time period, like an hour or hour and a half?<br /><br />Neutron Man

				But honestly weed is just terrible for the mail. Its big, bulky, smelly, and is an absolute bitch to package safely. I&#039;m so fucking tired of people bitching about how bad the prices are for weed are. Not everyone is priviledged enough to live in a place with local growers or even weed that is driven in. If you live in the deep rural midwest, SR is probably a better than nothing.<br /><br />However, hash is much better for the market as its smaller, easier to package, and once you know how to make it you can make it easily. Not everyone can make good hash but once you got it down packed it ain&#039;t rocket science.

				Is it really safe to receive weed in the mail, does the packages smells or anything? Personally i have never tried to buy some weed on SR because i have access to premium weed where i live, but hashish on the other hand is harder to find. Do you buy weed or hashish often on here guys?

				I prefer to smoke joints and i like the taste and smell of weed.<br />Weed has many faces and has great variety in taste and high. For me personally weed is smth naturally and hash is a bit more of a drug.<br />When it comes to smoke a bottle, i prefer hash.<br />But as many ppl already said, i think it&#039;s kind of a personal opinion.<br />Weed is the classic shit, you can see the love which was given to the plant, hash mostly has a &quot;crime story&quot; behind it (just personal experience).<br />Weed can be from small growers and friends, also can hash be, but it isn&#039;t that common.<br />I&#039;m just in marriage with my plants and weed, but sometimes i need to be fucked by a whore called hashish :D

				Just some weed burning gives me mouth watering.

Personally i have never tried to buy some weed on SR because i have access to premium weed where i live, but hashish on the other hand is harder to find. Do you buy weed or hashish often on here guys?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If the vendor takes the proper precautions then there shouldn&#039;t be any worries of receiving weed through the mail. A few week ago I was thinking the same thing, &quot;How safe is it to have weed sent to my location?&quot; A couple of purchases later, I&#039;m no longer worried as much about that. Some of the techniques I&#039;ve seen are incredible. You wouldn&#039;t know if there&#039;s weed inside of it unless you actively open it. I made the people I mentioned this site to into believers. <br /><br />As for Weed vs Hash it depends on your geographical location. In America, hash isn&#039;t as nearly as &quot;popular&quot; as weed, especially compared to Europe and the Middle East.That could be due to the limited knowledge of the product or the limited access to it. Both affect the supply/demand side of it. Only people I know who talk about it are &quot;potheads,&quot; not casual smokers. However, some of the Egyptians I used to work with swore up and down about how good hashish is. Personally, I haven&#039;t tried hashish enough to give an informed opinion. However, the last time I had it, I had it with weed in a bong. After I hit the bong, I became paralyzed momentarily. <br /><br />I&#039;ll probably start getting hashish soon, but I&#039;m infatuated with the different types of weed I can get on SR. SR is the closest thing to a dispensary for me. Can&#039;t wait for the Girl Scout Cookies.<br /><br />P.S. Are there any strains on SR that will a seasoned pothead couch locked/super baked ? (US vendors only)

				i find weed smokes better than hash. that is, weeds easier to smoke because of its material makeup, I find taking rips of weed more enjoyable, and hash is just different. you gotta try both a lot and you&#039;ll develop a preference but they go best together.

				Why not combine the two?<br /><br />A joint of sour diesel sprinkled with some bubble hash and a few snakes of maroc blonde? Can&#039;t really get much better than that

				With the exception of CapnJack&#039;s hash, I haven&#039;t had a hash that I felt was better than weed.... sadly.
