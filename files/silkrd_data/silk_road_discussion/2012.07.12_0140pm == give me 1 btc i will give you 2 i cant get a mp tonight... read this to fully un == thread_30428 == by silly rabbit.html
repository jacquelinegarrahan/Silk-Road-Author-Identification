				I already gave this person a piece of my mind...<br />To you rabbit: You have given us no reason whatsoever to trust you!<br />Tell us your life story and maybe someone will have a soft heart. Like I said, weed is weed. Go shop at your local 7/11.

				I already got a message from him, and I suggest you guys don`t give him/her any coins. Goddamn we`re gonna have to open another site called &#039;Bit-beggers online&#039; for our friends here.

				Am I wrong or has this person linked to the &quot;peaceandlove&quot; account been posting these for days now?<br /><br />I&#039;m the type of person who would totally toss someone .5 btc or even a whole coin if it was genuine, but this type of scamming ruins it for all others.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only been around a couple of weeks but is this a new phenomena for the forums?

This thing has been around for a long time I think, its a common practice called begging. It happens in real life/online games/credit based programs/etc.
