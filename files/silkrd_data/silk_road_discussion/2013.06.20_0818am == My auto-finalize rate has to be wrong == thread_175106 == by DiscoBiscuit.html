				I&#039;m fairly confused. This past weekend I was at Bonnaroo, and while there I guess one of my orders from albionessentialols auto-finalized. I still haven&#039;t received it so that kinda sucks. <br /><br />But anyways, I went to look at my Purchasing stats just to see what it did. My Auto-finalize rate is at 21.95%!!!! First off, I have a total of 8 transactions. Unless I&#039;ve completely overlooked something, it&#039;&#039;s quiet impossible to have a 21.95% auto-finalize rate. <br /><br />If I had ONE auto finalize, it would be 12.5% (1/8=.125)<br />If i had TWO auto finalize, it would be 25%<br /><br />.... Could someone enlighten me? Is there any way to get this fixed? <br /><br />Every person I&#039;ve ordered from can say that they have had no issues with me, of that I am sure. That 21.95% auto-finalize rate is a pretty nasty scar on my account...

				i think the percentage is of total amount of dollars/bitcoin spent and not total amount of orders.&nbsp; does the math work out that way?<br />&nbsp;that still sucks though. next time you could try to extend your deadline by a few days through resolution if it is close to the end &amp; you haven&#039;t received your order.&nbsp; I hope your order at least shows up soon.

				Next time just bang the resolution button and ask for a time extension. That&#039;ll let you stay in escrow whilst avoiding the AF.

				The same thing happened to me a while back.&nbsp; I believe the percentage is based on the last couple of months, not your entire history here. I&#039;ve been on here for over 2 yrs now, and due to my fuck up, I had something autofinalize.&nbsp; My stats were screwed up for a while.&nbsp; Just order a bunch of stuff...it will fix itself!!
