				well, it was going to go &#039;resolve&#039; if i didn&#039;t finalize, so i finalized, but i&#039;ve not received my product. the vendors page says they offer a 50% refund if the product is not received. <br /><br />i&#039;m in australia<br />it&#039;s been 17 days. (i may be jumping the gun but i&#039;ve made 20 or so purchases in the past five months and it&#039;s never taken this long, and i&#039;ve bought from this vendor before...)<br /><br />should i ask for a refund? i&#039;m nervous and i feel like an asshole but man, i spent like $140 and i&#039;m only a smalltime personal buyer and i don&#039;t have a lot of money. :( <br /><br />i don&#039;t think the vendor is a scammer or anything so at this point i don&#039;t want to name them and give them an unnecessary bad rep, i really do think it just got lost or seized or something.<br /><br />&gt;_&lt; <br /><br /><br /><br />plz halp

				You should have messaged the vendor before it finalised.<br /><br />You ought to message them now to explain you finalised but not received the product.<br /><br />I realise many want clean stats so finalise instead of resolve, but the resolve button gives an option to allow the vendor so many more days.<br /><br />But with you finalising it is down to the vendor now. SR cannot step in after finalising. It would be too complicated a process.<br /><br />Who is the vendor?<br /><br />Some are very good if you got decent stats. They might resend instead of 50% refund. but you need to change the name and address if you suspect it is seized as customs must have a database of suspicious addresses.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />

				thank you, i just had no idea what the resolve button did so i went with finalize. <br /><br />the vendor is chemical brothers, and i did message them to tell them i hadn&#039;t received the products and they said we&#039;d keep in touch.

				Ya man, just talk to the guy. Be charming ;)<br />Offer him sex or something if he&#039;s hesitant to give you the refund at first.<br /><br />I absolutely love &lt;3 your avatar. It&#039;s the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life.
