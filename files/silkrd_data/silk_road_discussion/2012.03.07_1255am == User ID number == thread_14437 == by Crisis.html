				On her profile page, ChristieNugs says she&#039;s cancelling orders from new customers unless your id number is below 155,000. How can locate your user number?

				I was wondering this myself. I have just decided to look elsewhere for my mj though because if they don&#039;t want me as a customer based entirely off of how long i have been a registered member, whatever. My current account has been active for almost a month and i have near 1k in completed business with 0%auto 0% refunds. I do not see what # I came to the site in has to do with anything, nor can i even find it, so fuck it! I will buy my pot from someone else.<br />P.S. I definitely had an account from right after the first gawker article but then I tried signing into a phishing SR site like an idiot so i started a new account because i had no BTC left and I would never feel safe using that account again.

				I&#039;m still not quite sure how they are implementing ti, because my id# changed today, but some peoples hasn&#039;t. tony76 for example is still in his signature the old way, and still works. I don&#039;t remember what mine was like 2119 or something not far off of that, but it wouldn&#039;t take me to my profile earlier today. strange

				I saw the same thing in Christy&#039;s profile the other day so i started looking.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/XXXX&nbsp; where XXXX represents a number (starting at 1) and going all the way up till...i think 196700+ when i stopped (highest it goes now is 201057), and i was basically able to see the most recent registered user. <br /><br />Use the same address above, it still works (up to user 201057), and replace it with the number Christy has http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/155000 and you will see the last customer eligible to shop with her. Go up or down as you please and you can try and find your user number this way.
