				Who is buying now?&nbsp; After last week, I feel like a idiot buying anything using bitcoins..&nbsp; &nbsp;This looks like I&#039;m going to have a clean couple weeks....&nbsp; I guess thats not a bad thing. I was over due for a reset.&nbsp; &nbsp;lol

				Get your coins, get them into SR and get your order in with the least possible delay and you won&#039;t have to stress too much what the exchange rate is. Buy $100 worth of bitcoins and by $100 worth of drugs with them and you don&#039;t have to care what the coins were worth in the past or will be worth in the future. Anything else is being a speculator - nothing wrong with that as long as you realize that&#039;s what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />The above is oversimplified, of course. The BTC system is not exactly bulletproof, as we have seen over the past week, so getting coins and getting them spent efficiently is more a theoretical concept maybe&nbsp; &gt;:(

				I have been messaging vendors before trying to place an order to see if everything will go through smoothly. One vendor said he will make a custom listing for me and overnight some shit for me to ensure it arrives by 4/20.
