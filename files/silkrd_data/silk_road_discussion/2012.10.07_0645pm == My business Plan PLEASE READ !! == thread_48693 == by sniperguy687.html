				Working sucks so I thought I could buy 25i nbome from tyl3r Durden @ around 1$ per tab and I would try to sell them for 3-10$ / tab and make a ton of profit. The thing is I don&#039;t know many druggies and people are scared they will develop Schizophrenia using this drug (from my research that is a ton of BS right ? debate on this) and how can I expand my customer base. I am going to school and I guess I could try promoting it there but I don&#039;t want people to think&nbsp; *Hey that&#039;s the LSD guy*. <br />1. Tell me how much is a tab of 25i nbome going for in your town ? <br />2. How could I expand my customer base ?&nbsp; (I was thinking I could wholesale it to other people and they would take care of selling it)<br />3. Can people develop Schizophrenia using this drug ? <br /><br />Thank you all and please comment ! <br /><br />UPDATE : <br /><br />Ordered 100 25i nbome 1mg tabs from SR for 92.22 $ <br />Sold 80 for 275$ <br />Experimented with 13 <br />Using the other 7 for marketing at the start <br />Ordered another 250 from another guy on SR 156.05$ should receive them anytime soon <br />Up to date I have 17.78$ cash on hand + repaid startup cash loan to myself (92.22$) + 250 tabs coming soon next I will order a full sheet so ill reduce my cost price ! <br /><br />Note: I have people interested to buy 1000 @ 2$ each buying 1000 would cost me around 500$ today so an easy profit of 1500$ for about 30 minutes worth of time ! <br />Also , I have been getting great reviews from the drug everybody loves it and people are asking me if I can get some speed and hash , thinking about buying the stuff of SR and selling but im not sure yet.<br /><br />I will update when all the 250 are sold ! <br />As always feel free to comment ! <br />

				I&#039;ve been thinking about the same thing. I don&#039;t really have a problem doing this as my experiences and the overwhelming majority of others&#039; experiences with 25i are overwhelmingly positive, with a few notable exceptions. In an area with a strong scene, or just lots of open-minded people, I believe this plan is highly feasible.

				So you&#039;re what? In high school? and your &quot;business plan&quot;, a term I am using loosely, is to commit a felony selling a drug that has unknown long term side effects to follow school kids? Seriously, do yourself a favor and stop while you&#039;re behind.

				While your idea to take something and sell it for more than what you paid is pretty much how this whole game works, you&#039;ve already stated to us that you don&#039;t REALLY have a customer base.&nbsp; This leaves you a couple options, you could 1.) attempt to honestly drum up a customer base while promoting factual information (so you will have to do your research on this, as you also clearly lack information) on a chemical that many people have not heard of and as such will be wary to try. This could basically leave you sitting on stacks of product for extended periods of time, which is in the very least a huge frustration and will not make you profit any time fast.&nbsp; or 2.) promote it as something it is not, such as LSD which, when (not if, when.) you are caught will leave you with no customers ever again, if not bleeding in an alley courtesy of people who didn&#039;t take to kindly to being mislead.<br /><br />If you want my opinion: Don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; Not worth the time/effort/headache/ultimate heart-break of realizing it won&#039;t work.

I certainly though it was college. And what would be so bad if it was opiates? I could make an argument that selling an opiate over a research chemical that causes hallucinations(bad ones) and bad trips for some people is a lot better. <br /><br />You would make a lot more money!<br /><br />And as for him being in college selling drugs?? Great!... he will be joining the 100&#039;s of other kids on campus selling drugs. I don&#039;t think he will be acting like a cartel and injuring students who don&#039;t pay. And whatever he decides to sell them will be 20x better for them then the illegal(and legal for those over 21) alcohol they will be consuming and &quot;over dosing&quot; on. That&#039;s a whole different thread.<br /><br />I agree with Lim that the real problem I have with the OP is calling this a business plan. If I didn&#039;t know better I would think he got help on writing the OP from Perky.<br /><br />As for him choosing to sell &quot; 25&quot; that is a terrible choice. For profit and return customers. If you wanted to be &quot;soft&quot; then you could sell them Xanax and Soma. There is nothing better then a college girl on Soma. Or any girl. People LOVE the feeling they get on Soma and Xanax. It is dirt cheap. Easy to get people to try. HUGE profit. Easy to get. Cheap to buy. Easy to hide. Won&#039;t get in a lot of trouble of caught. Did I mention how much girl love it??<br /><br />Though I am not against it, I think your idea of a business plan shows all of us that know..You would be a terrible drug dealer. YOU should not sell drugs at all. And I hope you have not taken any business classes yet and that is why your OP was so lame.<br /><br />Go to class, study hard, don&#039;t get fucked up. Instead stay sober so you can get good grades and get pussy when all the other guys are to fucked up to fuck and are usually passed out. Plus not being like every other guy is a huge bonus. And study hard and get good grades so that you have a good job, make a lot of money, so that you can buy good drugs and not sell them! <br /><br />

				Everyone make their own decisions, I will say though, selling on the street especially to people you know is a BAD juju approach. Youre asking for trouble, one of them will get busted (smart kids dont buy from friends/schoolmates) and they WILL rat on you, and than to keep time down you will give up your passwrds, and contacts, and if this thread is any indication of how intelligent you are, you likely saved everything unencrypted anyhow- or with your moms dob as a passwrd. <br /><br />Regardless, do what the others said, go back to school, think, work and let others do this ;)

				I think this is more appropriately called an &quot;idea,&quot; since there isn’t a lot of planning. There is many things that go into successfully selling. If you don’t have experience dealing with the police then I would advise you to learn some about them. Even selling whatever legal drugs your trying to sell if you market them for consumption its illegal. If the police heard and you seemed like an easy target and they didn’t have anything else to do they would focus on you. <br /><br />And even if you buy the tabs cheap your only getting like $5 or $10. So lets say you get $10 each and you make $9 profit or fuck it say you get $10 lol. If you sell 10 a day that’s $100. $100 isn’t that much for the risk.<br />

				I already know how this works, just let me tell ya buddy it bites you in the ass if people catch you selling an RC as LSD (or being vague and calling them &quot;fry&quot; or &quot;tabs&quot; but not really stating any chemical). You don&#039;t wanna be one of those fuckin&#039; kids in the news getting murder charges for selling an RC to someone who reacted badly to it.

				If you and all your friends want to be lab rats that people can look at in 30 years to see what research chemicals do to people, go for it I guess, but I&#039;m not going to take any drug with &quot;research&quot; in the name! <br /><br />If you want a real money making &quot;business plan&quot;, just sell crack!

				What I would do:<br /><br />1- Buy stock.<br />2- Setup an email account and learn how to cover your track.<br />3- Go out with potential buyers and act if like you would have bought your tabs from a &quot;weird internet guy&quot; (don&#039;t be too specific).<br />4- Offer some to try for free (you can go to a concert or whatever and trip with this guys). Do it in a way that looks like you are doing it because you are cool, not because you want to sell.<br />5- If they liked it, they would ask you where did you get them. With a little bit of resistance you give to them your fresh email.<br />6- Sell via email, and get paid using those prepaid cards you have in the first world :P<br />7- If you are going to sell on your campus, you don&#039;t even need to use the mail. Just drop them under the door when no one is around.<br />8- Please don&#039;t buy a luxury car 4 months later, everybody is going to realize what you have been doing, so, you will be fucked.<br /><br />It&#039;s the best structure I can imagine right now. Relatively safe, anonymous and you don&#039;t get the &quot;dealer&quot; tag.<br /><br />Cheers!

				Hey man, I just want to let you know it isn&#039;t as easy as it looks. If you&#039;re having side affects of schizophrenia, stop taking it right now. I came this close to developing schizophrenia from smoking weed (smoked 2-5 a day for over 2 years straight), it&#039;s almost scary, and I&#039;m still recovering. The best thing you can do is try to associate yourself with the people who look partiers/stoners, and then build friendship with them. Don&#039;t tell people that you&#039;re dealing LSD at all, that&#039;s probably a bad idea. Say you know somebody that can get cheappp LSD and that if they need any you can hook them up anytime they need it. Trust me, I tried selling weed before and there was loads of things I had to worry about that I didn&#039;t expect. As long as you keep the seller &quot;anonymous&quot; and let them know that you can get it for them &quot;24/7&quot; you should be in good condition and stay a lot safer than if you introduced yourself as the actual dealer.
