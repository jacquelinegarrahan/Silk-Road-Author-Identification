				Hey, so I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s anything you can do if you finalize after receiving a product and then it turns out the product isn&#039;t as specified.<br />I bought some acid and tried a tab and after waiting 5 hours, I messaged the seller stating that very little happened (slight giddiness and maybe sharper colors/sounds). He pretty much told me that I just didn&#039;t take enough (it was 100ug and this was the first time trying acid).<br />So I waited a few days and tried the 3 tabs I had left. Still, same effects. <br />I checked his reviews page in the forum and it appears that at least 2 others had similar problems. <br />To be fair, I checked his vendor page and one of the reviews said they tried said product and it worked. (I&#039;m guessing maybe the product wasn&#039;t laid well).<br />Is there anything I can do to resolve this. I don&#039;t want to be a dick about it but I don&#039;t really like just throwing money away...I already messaged the vendor.<br />I&#039;m not really calling him out publicly though if anyone looks through my comment history they could probably find who I&#039;m talking about easily. I&#039;m just curious what one does to rectify these situations.

				I&#039;m not sure what you could do besides leave negative feedback. If the vendor actually cares about his customers or at least his feedback he should get back to you.
