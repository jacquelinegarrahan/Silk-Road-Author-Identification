				checking DPR&#039;s profile it seems he was active a while yesterday until his last post about 11 hours ago. <br />so guess its likely he is/has been sleeping and this new downtime started right after he whent to sleep (maybe calculated by attackers for max impact..), but then hopefully will be awake soon within the coming hours or so^^<br />so atleast how it appears to me theres nothing unusual with his absence then, everyone needs sleep. hopefully he&#039;s doing well and was just sleeping and will come with some new updates soon then.. <br />or anyone know anything else?<br />

				Yeah well, when you&#039;ve been told that everything&#039;s all good and payments made during the outage have been credited, only to find the 150 BTC you sent your wallet is gone from the wallet through the block chain yesterday, but according to your DELETED account history was never recognised, as well as providing Silk Road staff all they need to clarify this within 9 minutes of their email, and getting nothing back from them after that, leaves me thinking what in the fucking fuck?
