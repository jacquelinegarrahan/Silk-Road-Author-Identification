				Not sure why I give a shit ::) but we&#039;ve finally eclipsed the November 14th record 3 minutes ago with users online. &quot;Most Online Today: 295. Most Online Ever: 295 (Today at 01:43 am)&quot;<br /><br />Uh huh. ::) <br /><br />Like I said, I don&#039;t really give a shit but thought I&#039;d say something useful for once. :P<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				A new &#039;Most Online Today&#039; record has been set, the 300 barrier was broken just over two hours ago:<br />&#039;Most Online Today: 304. Most Online Ever: 304 (Today at 08:23 pm)&#039;.<br />Two records in one day I think that&#039;s a first, wish I was here to be apart of this milestone and hope I will be here for the next one :)

				To be honest, im surprised there are not more people on!&nbsp; For petes sake, THE ROAD IS DOWN!!&nbsp; We all wanna know what the heck is going on, and also, you need to watch out for those LE&#039;s...as a matter of fact, I saw a person online a couple of days ago named &quot;CNN Journalist&quot;&nbsp; and he wanted to talk to some people that actually use the road...I saw that there were like 20 views, but no replies!!&nbsp; LOLOL&nbsp; &nbsp;Make sure you stay the f*** away from the likes of these!
