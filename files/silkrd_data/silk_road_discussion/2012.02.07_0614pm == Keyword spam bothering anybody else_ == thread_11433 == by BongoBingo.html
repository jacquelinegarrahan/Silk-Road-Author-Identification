				Seems like recently, when I search for, say, xanax I end up getting like 113 results, about 1/8 of which are actually xanax.&nbsp; Seems like most pill vendors are listing everything they have in every listing, making the search feature rather pointless.<br /><br />Any way to get them to stop this, or make it so that things can easily be found?

I&#039;ve been thinking that the search should have the option of searching only through the titles or that such spamming should be against the rules, but there has been no such luck so far. There&#039;s no work-around for the time being.

				Yeah, a title search would be nice.&nbsp; And not allowing the listings of other products in the the product listing would be nice, but would be a bitch to enforce, I&#039;d imagine.&nbsp; It&#039;s really not necessary, since you can just click on the vendor name and see all their listings anyway.<br /><br />Oddly enough this only seems to be happening with benzos for me.&nbsp; The only other thing I could think of to make them navigable would be to have a category for each drug, but that seems like overkill too.

				Maybe put this to feature requests? Check box to Search in title only otherwise search in title and description.
