				I processed a $400 MP as part of an order and discovered before paying for it that the order came from a scammer vendor. Another customer has provided proof they owned another MP that was part of this order and has been paid. If you were scammed and can provide the MP number AND a copy of the receipt I will give you your bitcoins. The scammer obviously also has the MP number so you must provide a photo or scan of the receipt. Please message me on SR not on the forums. This is the only MP I have, if you were scammed for any other amount I&#039;m sorry but you&#039;ll need to message SR support, I won&#039;t be able to help you.<br /><br />Stay safe!
