I have no idea who Susan is, nor Richard or Adrian but I like to talk about them anyway because it makes me feel like I know people even when I don&#039;t. I am seeing a therapist about this and they say that my need to feel like I belong and my racial hatred and xenophobia probably stem from a shit child hood but yano, any excuse to take my anger out on others and not deal with my own shit.&quot;<br /><br />Sound about right sweetheart?
