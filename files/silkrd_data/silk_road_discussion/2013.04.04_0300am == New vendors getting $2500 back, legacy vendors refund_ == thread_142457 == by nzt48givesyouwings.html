				I had this posted in another thread but somehow it was deleted. Not censorship on the Road I hope?<br /><br />Someone in the last thread mentioned that new vendors who paid in $500 were refunded their original BTC now worth ~$2500. A separate vendor after this post occurred asked if legacy vendors qualify for the same refund.<br /><br />I echo this question. Vendors that came in before are doing just as well for the community than the vendors that came in later :)<br /><br />If both options were available today, I definitely would have taken the $500 with refund vs nonrefundable $150. I paid in about ~15BTC. If I had held onto those (which I would have), would be very significant now. Requesting that mods re-evaluate legacy vendors refund of original fees as we were here first and helped SR grow just as much as the newbies getting refunded!

Wasn&#039;t making any accusations or pointing fingers :)<br /><br />For me it&#039;s less about the BTC rate and more about the principle. We were buying vendor accounts, and not simply clearing a vendor scam filter, right? That&#039;s what I thought, but apparently it&#039;s much more about the trust filter and not a privilege which must be purchased. If this is indeed true, then all trustworthy vendors should be treated equally, regardless of what the material affects of the situation are. But yes the BTC skyrocketing in value certainly makes this harder to forget about.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to create a forum that results in a ton of whining, but feel this should be officially reviewed by the folks on top when there aren&#039;t more important things that require their attention :)

				I understand where you are coming from, and appreciate your levelheaded post and response.&nbsp; Things have been hectic lately, but once everything calms down, who knows what will change, or how our community will evolve.&nbsp; If you wanted a direct response from higher up, your best option would be to send Vendor Support a message over on the main site.&nbsp; (but, as you know, there&#039;s a lot going on right now so I can&#039;t guarantee a response.)

				Thanks Scout. Will hang tight til things settle down a bit and then message support.<br /><br />More just wanted to have some record for the community so that the decision making and response is for a collective of people rather than just 1 or 2.

I don&#039;t see why an increased bond for future vendors would make old vendors non eligible for their past bonds.<br />If the bonds were exposed, which is what I read, by December 2012 bonds paid in mid 2012 were worth almost double the 500$ of new bonds. How is taking this money justified and what is it used for?<br /><br />omnis<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Vendors who paid $150 didn&#039;t purchase a bond, they paid a fee. There is a distinct difference between the two; the bond is different from the fee in the sense that it is held by Silk Road to ensure that a vendor does not scam buyers, the caveat being that if the vendor does scam buyers they will not get their bond back. The fee was simply an amount of money paid to Silk Road in order to contribute to the running and upkeep of the site, and being a fee - by its very definition - was non-refundable. A bond, by its definition, is refundable or exchangeable to the value of the bond.<br /><br />Previously to the bond being brought in instead of a vendor fee, the vendor fees were used to pay for server costs etc., until the fees grew large enough to be able to support the site without the need for a vendor fee.<br /><br />Silk Road did not &#039;take&#039; your money, you paid it to them willingly in order to purchase vending privileges. If the bond system were to be applied retroactively then Silk Road would have to pay out an incredibly large amount of Bitcoin to all previous vendor account holders, possibly bankrupting Dread Pirate Roberts as some vendors paid 50+ BTC for their account when prices were ~$3.00. Those 50 BTC would now be worth $8,248.00, and having to refund hundreds, if not thousands of vendors BTC at today&#039;s value would mean no more Silk Road.<br /><br />As stated, the vendor fees were cashed out and used to pay for the actual running and upkeep of the site. The vendor bonds are simply held at an address thereby making the volatile BTC value a non-issue, meaning that refunding legitimate vendors does not cost 55 times more than what they actually paid.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I can only guess that vendor fees make up a VERY small percentage of SR gross revenue compared to commissions<br /><br />2) It doesn&#039;t matter what the coins are worth now if they were kept in coins. We&#039;d just be getting the coins back that we paid in, just like the new vendors<br /><br />3) Regarding retroactive contracting and capitalism - generally things cost MORE as time goes on, so the people that were in first get the BETTER end of the deal, not the worse end. Verizon&#039;s unlimited data plan is a great example. If you signed up for an unlimited data plan, you get to keep it even though those plans are not available today. It&#039;s called getting grandfathered into the new practice. If a policy gets worse for older members as time goes on, (i.e. Verizon charging $10 a month for 500 text messages, and then releasing an unlimited package for $5 a month), you get to switch to the new policy. <br /><br />These are just examples and I can probably think of better ones but they are the first ones that came to mind. <br /><br />It&#039;s good customer service, something that I value very highly with my customers :)

				This thread is just what I needed to see right now. I have been a vendor for about 5-6 weeks and paid 11.50BTC/$500 bond for my account. I&#039;ve been kicking myself as those 11.5BTC are worth far now than the total value of my current stock. There is no way I can get back to the level of my original holding, even with these price rises. At least that&#039;s what I thought. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m not the smartest cookie in the jar, but am I right in assuming that there IS at least the possibility of me getting 11.5 coins back, instead of a measly $500 worth?<br />

Have some perspective...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey curiousitymatrix - this thread exists precisely because the opposite seems to be true - SR isn&#039;t hedging the Vendor bond, and is refunding the amount of coins, not the $500. Otherwise you&#039;re right for $150 there wouldn&#039;t be much to whine about :)

I can only guess that vendor fees make up a VERY small percentage of SR gross revenue compared to commissions<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree with you completely, however when Silk Road first started up and began charging vendor fees there was no SR commission, thus vendor account fees were the only income stream that Silk Road had and it follows that those fees were used for the site&#039;s upkeep.<br /><br />Today the situation is very different, and indeed after Silk Road started charging commission, the fees were kept, presumably in order to deter every Tom, Dick and Harry from opening an account and potentially scamming customers without any initial expense on their part; that fee has since been eliminated and Silk Road brought in the bond system to discourage scamming. A higher initial cost to further deter scamming behaviour (after all, previously a scammer only had to make $150 before they broke even with everything on top of that being pure profit), and it is refundable after 30+ transactions worth $1500 in sales and 6 weeks trading, further encouraging good behaviour.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142457.msg997001#msg997001">Quote from: nzt48givesyouwings on April 10, 2013, 05:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2) It doesn&#039;t matter what the coins are worth now if they were kept in coins. We&#039;d just be getting the coins back that we paid in, just like the new vendors<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, I agree with you; however, it is highly unlikely that all of those bitcoins were kept in Bitcoin. It is more likely that a sizeable proportion were cashed out to pay for the site&#039;s security, upkeep and maintenance, and to provide Dread Pirate Roberts with payment. It is entirely possible that they were indeed kept as bitcoins and not cashed out, though as stated I consider it unlikely. The fact remains though that they were paid as a fee - something that vendors agreed to pay in order to ply their wares here - and not as a bond.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142457.msg997001#msg997001">Quote from: nzt48givesyouwings on April 10, 2013, 05:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3) Regarding retroactive contracting and capitalism - generally things cost MORE as time goes on, so the people that were in first get the BETTER end of the deal, not the worse end. Verizon&#039;s unlimited data plan is a great example. If you signed up for an unlimited data plan, you get to keep it even though those plans are not available today. It&#039;s called getting grandfathered into the new practice. If a policy gets worse for older members as time goes on, (i.e. Verizon charging $10 a month for 500 text messages, and then releasing an unlimited package for $5 a month), you get to switch to the new policy. <br /><br />These are just examples and I can probably think of better ones but they are the first ones that came to mind. <br /><br />It&#039;s good customer service, something that I value very highly with my customers :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Some of the points here I must disagree with; you cannot compare something like a Verizon contract whereby you may switch to the new package if it is a better deal to Silk Road fees and bonds. Verizon only offer this in order to keep their customers as those customers would not renew their contracts if they could get a better deal elsewhere. On Silk Road there is no time limit on your contract, or any need to renew as it was a once-off fee.<br />Verizon would not offer the ability to switch to better deals if they worked on a once-off fee model as there is no incentive to keep the customer using Verizon; they have already been paid for the service, and there is no prospect of extra future income from that customer.<br /><br />Silk Road already provides excellent customer service in the form of SR Support and minimal downtime. I think the last reports I saw were Silk Road having 98%+ uptime which is fairly impressive for a marketplace with so many well-funded adversaries.<br /><br />What you are talking about is not &#039;customer service&#039; though, it is in fact &#039;customer retention&#039;. In other words, it is Verizon keeping their customers happy so as they do not switch to AT&amp;T or Sprint (I&#039;m not American so please do forgive me if those companies do not offer the same services as Verizon - you understand what I&#039;m getting at though, I&#039;m sure.)<br /><br />Silk Road has neither incentive nor need to do that as there are no meaningful competitors to the Silk Road marketplace, thus no incentive to return the initial vendor fee (nor an obligation to do so), and no need to employ practices that result in customer retention as customers (vendors) are going to continue to do business here regardless.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142457.msg998459#msg998459">Quote from: CannaKingUK on April 10, 2013, 01:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This thread is just what I needed to see right now. I have been a vendor for about 5-6 weeks and paid 11.50BTC/$500 bond for my account. I&#039;ve been kicking myself as those 11.5BTC are worth far now than the total value of my current stock. There is no way I can get back to the level of my original holding, even with these price rises. At least that&#039;s what I thought. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m not the smartest cookie in the jar, but am I right in assuming that there IS at least the possibility of me getting 11.5 coins back, instead of a measly $500 worth?<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You will get back the amount of Bitcoin that you paid in - in your case, 11.5 BTC.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142457.msg998872#msg998872">Quote from: curiositymatrix on April 10, 2013, 05:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I know this won&#039;t be a popular sentiment, but...<br />I think when a transaction takes place, it is for the &quot;value&quot; at that time.

I presume you are using the purchasing stats system to make your assumption. Purchasing stats are always denominated in USD, with the BTC value changing depending on the current USD/BTC price. The bond system is denominated in Bitcoin.<br /><br />The vendor in question did not pay $500 for their vendor account, they paid $500 in Bitcoin for it; that is, they paid X amount of Bitcoin when each Bitcoin was worth X amount of USD.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Sorry; I misunderstood the conversation. <br /><br />But what I see is: however you do it, (return exact coin value, or hedge it and return dollar value), someone will wind up such that it hurts them.

Vendors that came in before are doing just as well for the community than the vendors that came in later :)<br /><br />If both options were available today, I definitely would have taken the $500 with refund vs nonrefundable $150.
