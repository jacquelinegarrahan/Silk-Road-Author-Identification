				Hi, I just came to SR today because I wanted to get some IDs.&nbsp; I read many posts about &quot;Beware&quot; because &quot;feedback can be faked&quot; of course, but if the vendor has 75+ like after their name vendorname(75) that means 75 ratings right, if most or all are good then it must be legit right?&nbsp; The reason I ask is because the passport I want to buy is over 1000 Bitcoins so that is currently like 4,000 to 5,000 USD and they want Early Finalizing on escrow too.&nbsp; It just sounds a little crazy to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Should I just stick to SR for my pharmaceutical needs and forget this lavish passport purchase.&nbsp; Has anyone successfully bought a passport from SR and traveled with it?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks

				Thank yourself for coming to the forum and asking the community for advice. In case you are actually serious:<br /><br />I would vehemently say PLEASE DO NOT send 1000 bitcoins to anyone on the site without first receiving the product. <br /><br />Especially not to the vendor you are referring about, although I do not know which one it is... this seems extremely risky. A good vendor score is between 95- 100... thats the rating percentage, out of 100, so the vendor has had trouble with 1 out of 4 orders at least. Its not the number of good ratings... Considering much of the feedback could be fraudulent, he may just be a scammer completely. Click on the vendor name and look at his profile and feedback at the very minimum, as well as searching for his name on the forum. Even if he had a freaking 100 rating though, I wouldnt finalize early with that much money ever!<br /><br />Good luck,<br />- miR

				If you finalize early you WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY!!<br /><br />The number next to their name goes from 0-100&nbsp; I would not buy from someone who has a number below 95 and always use escrow.<br /><br />If you finalize early you WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY!!<br />

				The vendor you are most likely referring to has had no sales in 2 months, and most of the feedbacks from before that, are for a 4btc download of botnet source code.<br /><br />All in a sudden this vendor shows up after months with such a high-priced item.......and out of escrow please................go figure.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather burn money than send it there.<br /><br />There are and were a couple good vendors here for simple fake IDs, like drivers licenses one can print with the proper equipment. Passports are a whole different animal altogether. Especially if they claim they work.<br /><br />That would require one to embed an RFID with the bearers biometric data and fingerprint. So, fuck that, I have yet to see a &quot;passport&quot; or &quot;new identity&quot; posting here that doesn&#039;t raise a bright red flag only two or three lines into the offer.<br /><br />Okay, so, I had a closer look, it&#039;s ridiculous. 4 feedbacks between 2 and 3 months ago. 1 of them says never got anything got refunded by SR, the other 3 are 4btc downloads. The other four recent feedbacks are of the &quot;Lottery type&quot;. Meaning minimum amount transactions. This is currently a popular way to &quot;pad&quot; feedback ratings.
