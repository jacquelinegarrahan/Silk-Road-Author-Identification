				This is really humorous that this loser is still upset that his account was shut down and he lost his funds. That was like 6 months ago.<br /><br />Infinite source has since had 15 different names. And we always catch him every time. That is what a stupid loser he is. But the best part is I exposed him. I got his account shut down. I got his 6k in BTC taken away from him.<br /><br />He is a meathead so he gets high and then gets really upset that he lost his money and that we make fun of him.<br /><br />Not one thing he ever says is true. He has no real information,and he thinks we believe it is real. LOL. He also somehow thinks he is going to get money.. <br /><br />I just wanted to make a point that I still laugh about this loser whenever I hear he is lurking around. <br /><br />He actually took the title away from Perky as the biggest loser, lowlife,nobody in the sites 2 year history.<br />And the best part at one time he had 27 orders and all of them 5/5 and a 10 rating. Then he lies about having a DCN and within 24 hours I get his account shut down, his BTC confiscated and he starts crying all over the Forums. Literally crying. ONLINE. OVER THE NET. LMAO Just begging for help. HE GOT NONE.<br />Still hope you overdose. Or live. As your life is so bad that having to live with it is worse then death. PATHETIC. Did your mom die of shame? Did she even claim you? I doubt it.

Cuz its him, and no other explanation required&quot;<br /><br />What is even better is you Heat had something to do with this! Once again you did the community good and got rid of another one of this losers scam accounts. I believe that his funds that were seized went into an account that DPR used to pay his staff. So his money went to pay the same mods that were banning him.LOL<br /><br />Oh, Btw, I just stopped laughing Heat. I LOVE what a total loser this guy is and how you totally OWN HIM. Your like his Daddy. And I am like his Step Daddy.... As I just beat him. That is all I do.....Just smack him around like I own him.

				Ive been a vendor quite some time and never heard of this guy, but how was he scamming people and getting 100% 5/5s? i know it would not be hard to do but just curious why he got the money confiscated. was he actually selling something or just extorting buyers or something? Sorry, My curiosity got the best of me.
