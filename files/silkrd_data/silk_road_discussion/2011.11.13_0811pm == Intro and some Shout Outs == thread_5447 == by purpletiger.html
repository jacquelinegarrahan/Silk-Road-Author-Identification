				First post.&nbsp; Obviously I&#039;m new to SR.&nbsp; Been on here a couple of weeks getting prepped for my first purchase and lurking on these forums.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking for something like this for years and just happened to stumble onto this completely by accident.&nbsp; I like to think of it as divine providence.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;d like to thank some people.<br /><br />Big Ups:&nbsp; To everyone on these forums, without the regular contributors and the various tutorials I would have been lost, particularly when it comes to Bitcoins and PGP.&nbsp; <br /><br />BigBigUps:&nbsp; To the SR admins and the forum moderators, you make this all possible.&nbsp; You are my heroes.<br /><br />HugeUps:&nbsp; To vendor vanillasmoke.&nbsp; Decided to test the waters with this vendor based on feedback, forum reviews, and having the right product at the right price.&nbsp; I placed an order early Friday and it was moved to &quot;in transit&quot; by the time I logged in Saturday night.&nbsp; This is way better than I expected.&nbsp; Thanks vanilla for taking a chance on this noob and not asking me to finalize early.&nbsp; Trust me, I&#039;ll take care of you within minutes of having the product in my hand.&nbsp; You my dawg dawg.<br /><br />Keep up the good work everyone.&nbsp; I hope I can be a SR buyer and forum contributor for a long time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Happy Undergrounding,&nbsp; <br /><br />purpletiger

				Welcome purptiger. Think my order with vanillasmoke is right behind yours as I ordered Sat. You&#039;ll have to let us know how it goes. Although his stuff doesnt have a name like DoublePenetration-CaptainCrunch, I&#039;m sure its good chet.
