				was talking earlier about parents drug testing their kids. seems to be a trend these days. my parents never approved of drug use at 14, neither do i, but they would never turn me into the cops because of what they rightfully deemed a mistake. Guess its either for the state to reare the child than the parent. Kid&#039;d just call cps if he didnt get his way, thats what they teach em in schools today. and i have neg karma for saying kids should be reduced on sr to maintain its elite status, this place is going to end up like the rest of the markets if they dont take action agaonst filtering out low class clientel.

The website includes information on how to package, handle and distribute the drugs.<br /><br />Users can also access information on how to avoid scrutiny by police and get feedback on the quality of the drugs on offer.<br /><br />Users must use a digital currency that is not regulated and difficult for law enforcement agencies to trace.<br /><br />The boys&#039; parents approached Esperance police because they were concerned at packages they were receiving through the mail.<br /><br />Staff at the local Australia Post sorting depot had also become concerned. Detectives launched an investigation dubbed Operation Cinder and identified the source of the drugs as The Silk Road.<br /><br />http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/newshome/14980079/brothers-in-court-over-online-drugs/

Even if they don&#039;t agree with doing drugs, parents who alienate their kids by &#039;putting their foot down&#039; or any other crap are really losing out - they&#039;ll most likely just push their children away (rather than put them off doing drugs, as they intend) and they lose out on sharing in their kid&#039;s lives. Plus, their kids don&#039;t have support if they do go off the rails. A lose-lose situation. I guess it&#039;s all about letting go of having &#039;power&#039; over your children though and letting them live their own life their own way, rather than fulfilling the parent&#039;s aspirations for their progeny...<br /><br />Parents who shop their kids to the police for it seem sociopathic to me&nbsp; :o

				In the other hand, it must be hard for a parent who have no experience with drugs to tell if your kid is smart enough and just experimenting, or turning into a junkie.<br /><br />Mines never approved, but they ended trusting me and &quot;accepted&quot; it, and i&#039;m grateful for that<br /><br />but turning them to the police&nbsp; :o some people should never be parents

				I personally do not feel anyone under 18 or so should be getting anything off here. If you are too young that you&nbsp; can&#039;t pay your own bills, you should not be here. This will feed the hate mongers because it&#039;s all about the fucking children bs.

				Wow, some of you people have really cool parents. My mother started crying once when she found a pack of smokes in my pants once, I can&#039;t even imagine how she&#039;d react if she knew about my drug habits. She&#039;d probably guilt-trip me into oblivion.<br /><br />But yeah, a parent has to be pretty fucking stupid to turn in their own kids for using drugs. Even if you&#039;re extremely anti-drugs, surely you realize that it&#039;s better for the kid to stay out of the legal system. Why not just ground the kid and order private drugtests every other week?

				Okay guys, I have a couple of thoughts and I probably know more about everything there is to know than all of you combined so listen up.<br /><br />Firstly I agree with most of the comments about how stupid Mother is getting son into the system. Big mistake. But so is admitting to anything at all, EVER! (see my signature) However the acorn doesn&#039;t fall far from the tree so brightboy and Mom are accomplices to each other&#039;s fate.<br /><br />The only circumstance where a parent can even think about turning in their kid is when the kid is so out of control and uncaring of the parent&#039;s rules and authority that the parent has literally given up and would eject the kid from the household except that&#039;s against the law due to the kid&#039;s youth. This kid respects authority enough to (foolishly) admit to his hobby and give details. Mom should have taken matters into her own hands and done what a parent should do - discipline him herself.<br /><br />Which leads me to my next point. This &quot;Mother&quot; Fucker is upset because she is totally incapable of parenting. She abdicated her authority to the state out of shame for not being the parent she should have been all along. The bitch should have gone to jail FOR her kid before turning in her son. I want to slap this stupid bitch.<br /><br />Now for the misogynistic part (that&#039;s right that last part wasn&#039;t it yet). Some of you wrote that you can&#039;t believe Mom&#039;s could do such a thing. Well I have news for you. There are a lot of women in general who would do the same thing to YOU, my friends. I am talking to both sexes here. Watch the fuck out for women. When Shakespeare wrote, &quot;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.&quot; He knew what he was talking about! If you are doing anything illegal, for God&#039;s sake do NOT let any women know about it. If you think you have a good one who is &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;safe&quot; just let her catch you licking the wet spot of her sister, daughter, mother, best friend or her roommate and you will quickly learn the meaning of blind rage, and you will be glad the men in blue are there to take you into protective custody.<br /><br />Now you ladies who think I am a woman hater, look again, I am writing this gender neutral. You women loving women need to watch out too. Your girlfriends are just as dangerous. Furthermore, any male friends with a tendency toward bitchiness can be subject to the same cruel and heartless behavior when wronged. &quot;Beware the bitches&quot; You can quote me on that.<br /><br />Ya&#039;ll feel me?<br /><br />Modzi

				&quot;My main concern was just to make sure I was doing everything I could to try to save his life, and I knew I couldn&#039;t do it on my own,&quot;<br /><br />So your solution is this...<br /><br />His mother said the boy was charged with attempted possession of a controlled substance... ----- Meth charge at 14yo Good jump on life, Mom...<br /><br />&quot;I was angry at the means with which he got his hands on these drugs,&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Looking back, I realize that I had helped to fund his Bit Coin account,&quot;<br /><br />So your angry at yourself? You should be... Essentially, in this case, you were his dealer you cunt of a mum...<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s out there. It&#039;s available,&quot; said Holt<br /><br />Yes, let&#039;s advertise that there are indeed more drugs available for kiddies to buy. Fucking moronic pig.<br /><br />&quot;I just don&#039;t think that anyone really knows about what it is, and what having those Bit Coins can bring into your home, can bring into your life, and how easily it can destroy something,&quot;<br /><br />Chances of destroying someones life.... <br /><br />Non-tangible currency that cannot physically harm anyone = %0<br /><br />Retarded fucking mother who now has you classified as a meth addict according to the US gov&#039;t for a mistake you made at 14yo&nbsp; = %100<br /><br />&quot;You have to decide, do you trust someone that is advertising that they are going to be a hitman? Do you trust that person advertising that they are going to send you illegal drugs? And, really, you&#039;re not going to go to the police and say, &#039;I tried to buy drugs, I tried to hire a hit man and they stole my money.&#039; That&#039;s not something that happens, and criminals know that that&#039;s an easy victim pool,&quot;<br /><br />1. It&#039;s called escrow you measly fuck...<br />2. You sound disappointed that the Hit-man darknet site doesn&#039;t deliver? Need to get your gay lover taken care of&nbsp; Lt.?<br /><br />&quot;However, a Carnegie Mellon research paper from July 2012 found a surprisingly high feedback rating for many sellers of drugs and other goods on Silk Road&quot;<br /><br />OMG! WE BETTER PUT THIS ACTUAL INFORMED STUDY AT THE BOTTOM!!!!<br /><br />&quot;The mother speaks to her son frequently in phone calls from the detention center and she said he blames her for getting him into legal trouble.&quot;<br /><br />At least the son puts blame where blame is due! Poor kid, almost wish I could adopt him from these grimey ass parents he has.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />Mom is a fucking moron, ruined kids life single handed, idiotic cops offer uninformed comments as usual, kid is now classified as a meth addict. <br />

				&quot;Fishers police write that they tested the substance and confirmed it was Ecstasy, a form of MDMA, or methamphetamine.&quot;<br />&nbsp;so meth=X lol<br /><br />and apparently we &quot;sell guns and bombs&quot; on here.... good to know<br /><br />lmao the media is a joke and<br />this kids mom is a C_NT<br /><br />we all need to start taking the fight club approach to SR and make sure that we notify other users, all users (because we dont know ages and locations) but<br /><br />rule no 1: You do not talk about SR<br />rule no.2: YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT SR<br /><br />its hard to enforce but might be possible and besides that all users should feel a moral obligation<br />to follow our own code of honor <br /><br />just dont use the marketplace until you have a drop local and never talk to anyone about it! <br />I would grabbed the package outta my moms hand and flushed it myself then deal with being grounded or whatever dumb punishment next...better than getting locked up..

				WTF.

				It&#039;s always a witch hunt for the &#039;bad man&#039; who is doing head things to their children. It&#039;s never the parents fault. <br /><br />Sadly, since we can&#039;t defend ourselves, we will have to soak it up and take the blame. <br />Everyone here is now associated with children and drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;We chat with them and sell them drugs here.&nbsp; We can&#039;t stop it, but parents can ask their authorities to stop it.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is how we are going to be attacked or already are. Now there is a morally justified reason to spend tax dollars on stopping us.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are a threat to youth everywhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yikes. <br /><br />Now I feel really ashamed about mentioning this site.&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone could say, &quot;isn&#039;t that the site that kids go to buy drugs?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Or do you just go there to chat with the kids or sell to them?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />No sense in pointing fingers here.&nbsp; &nbsp;But there needs to be a way to stop parents letting their kids come here in the first place. <br /><br />Can we make a version of TOR bundle pre-loaded with Silk Road as the home page.&nbsp; Then, we could ask for age verification like porn sites do.&nbsp; It&#039;s not perfect but it shows we are trying.&nbsp; &nbsp;It would restrict this version to adults. <br />Dunno, just an idea.<br /><br />Maybe a warning on entry?&nbsp; Click here if you are over 21 .. . I just want to something that shows we don&#039;t condone or promote it. <br /><br />

				Ya your right, but I think many buyers here don&#039;t care about being anonymous anyway, sites like .to&nbsp; tell you upfront that they are recording your actions and this is the most insecure way to access a website.&nbsp; But people still click the link anyway, knowing that this info will be handed over to authorities.&nbsp; Now that is dumb. <br /><br />I guess I meant to say we should demonstrate or make an official statement on the issue, instead of nothing at all and looking like we love chatting and selling to children.<br /><br />For example, who buys a pack of smokes for $16 on Silk Road with $24. shipping?&nbsp; &nbsp;As if.&nbsp; That listing is most likely aimed for kids.&nbsp; I could be wrong.&nbsp; There are some dumb people.&nbsp; But it sure looks like we have a few listings aimed at kids.<br />

				Well, if the parents are lucky, they&#039;ll put the kid in prison for a few years and they won&#039;t have to deal with him for a while.
