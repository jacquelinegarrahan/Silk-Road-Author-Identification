				this is just one HUGE step forward for the silk road. <br /><br />this can help in so many ways, it can prove the seller actually has the product and isnt a scammer and it can prove the quality of the product.<br /><br />soon, it will be a must for sellers to upload images,&nbsp; because people would be more likely to buy the product.<br /><br /><br />im so stoked, especially since i had such a hard time using the onion image uploader.<br /><br /><br />+1silkroad&nbsp; ;D

				This is good but a couple of points<br /><br />1) It doesn&#039;t prove the seller has the product as people can easily search for images of the drug... in the case of prescirption stuff it&#039;s alsmost a timesavere as it all looks the same anyway.<br /><br />2) I remebmer reading somewhere that uploading things on .tor could lead to you giving away your IP address. Is this at all a risk with uploading pictures here? I trust Silk Road but not so much that I&#039;d wanna risk anybody having my IP.

				you make a good point but obviously you can time stamp it and put your vendor name next to it, thats what im going to do, and thats what all sellers should do in order to prove they have good quality as well as the product.<br /><br />im not going to just buy something if i see a picture of drugs, the reputation matters more then anything, but the picture helps tremendously <br /><br />and correct me if wrong but im pretty sure its only downloading things that can compromise your anonymity<br /><br /><br />

				I can also imagine having photos as *increasing* successful scammer activity.<br /><br />The newbies see a photo and think that somehow legitimates the person on the listing having product.<br /><br />So, they read the posts on the forums even less; seek out even less other info besides the listing itself.<br /><br />I hope it wouldn&#039;t happen...but I&#039;m really betting it will.&nbsp; :o

				@joeblow2<br /><br />yeah i thought about this, but honestly, if they didnt take the time to check on the seller&#039;s rep, or read the buyers guidelines, then they will have to learn what not to do somehow...<br /><br /><br />and with escrow system, all is usually well in the end, unless some newbie gets conned to do an out of escrow transaction..<br /><br />

				For sure I would reccommend timestamping and adding vendor names to images. However there is a potential security risk in having images of these printed.<br /><br />More importantly sellers need to remember to remove metadata from images before uploading them! Often images can contain information about the make of camera, date and time and possibly GPS coords (device dependent I guess).
