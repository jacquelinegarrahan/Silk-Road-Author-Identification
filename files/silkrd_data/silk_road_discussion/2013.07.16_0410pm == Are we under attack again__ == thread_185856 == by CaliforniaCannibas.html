				For the past 48 hours ....I keep getting knocked off about every 5-10 minutes and have to re-log in.....then some times the captcha....only shows 3-4 characterizations.....which is wrong....and you have to go through a few<br />of those before it lets you log back in......really reminds me of when we were under attack a few months ago......<br /><br />Anyone else having problems

				SR is likely undergoing technical issues, if not a DOS attack, because as a bunch of us at the other thread have already mentioned, our BTC deposits are not showing up even after 11+ confirmations when the usually show up after 6-7. Something is definitely not normal.

				I&#039;m staying logged in fine, its just the BTC thing for me, which DPR has addressed. It is odd behavior though - not sure how I feel about having a whole bunch of coins in limbo for this long.
