				Interesting, I assumed more home grow operations there for weed than what it sounds like. Especially considering how large and remote some of the areas seem to be. I understand customs there is a bit tricky for imports but regular old weed wow?

				Ah I wish I never closed my little grow op a couple years ago. The prices are crazy but the only way you could offer RRP weed on the road is if you were growing it yourself. Let&#039;s say you get a really good price on a lb of what SR would consider good weed, $3200 or $200 per ounce. Most people can easily move that IRL amongst trusted friends without too much risk or effort anyway so you need more incentive ($) to be working on the road where you have to spend at least 3 hours per day dealing with shitty customers asking 3 questions about tracking on their lil stick&#039;o&#039;weed, packaging product and posting the shit out. Every day.<br /><br />Costs to move 1 oz:<br />$200 per oz. purchase price<br />$20 SR fee (estimate 5-10%. )<br />Post (inc materials) costs $10 per item. <br />Being an illegal op let&#039;s call the hourly rate at $50 so you need $150 per day to pay yourself for the work you (or your partner) actually do &amp; the &quot;Business&quot; profit is whats left over.. <br />Let&#039;s say a SR vendor moves a QP (4 oz&#039;s) per day so add roughly $40 per oz for time costs. So we&#039;re already sitting at an actual cost of roughly $270 per oz. Let&#039;s add 10% on top of that to cash out your BTC. We are now at roughly $300 p/oz cost to the vendor (I like to round things off for simplicity, I swear I can actually count). I think any real business wants to make at least 40% markup on product after paying all their costs sooo.... $300 + 40% = $420 per oz<br /><br />Now compare the markup the SR weed vendors are getting compare to their chem dealer counterparts and it&#039;s easy to see why so few come to the road to sell weed &amp; also why they feel justified in charging top $. On top of all this, the buyer usually has an extra 10% costs to actually get BTC so let&#039;s just rough it out at a $450 per oz when all is said &amp; done.<br /><br />Just go chat to your local stoners &amp; get the shit at a real price... Or better still, grow your own!

				supply and demand are 2 sides of the same coin. to put it simply if they don&#039;t have the supply to support current demand they raise the price which lowers demand as it prices people out of the market. many other factors come into play like lack of competition and busted grow ops. if it&#039;s silk road specific then afaik quite a few of your vendors are resellers and your customs being so notoriously tough increases the risk and losses that vendors have to take into account when pricing.

				Fair points. So $400 ounce is a good value for SR.<br /><br />How come so few vendors sell ounces then if overheads are so high for each transaction? wouldnt they prefer bigger sales to low maintenance buyers than pokey little deals?<br /><br />I am talking Aus domestic btw, I would never risk importing.

				I don&#039;t see anything wrong with $400 p/oz on the road considering all the road dealers seem to be resellers &amp; not growers. Vendors still make much more when selling many smaller deals than fewer larger ones and due to SR anonymity the risk isn&#039;t much greater slinging sticks at $600 p/oz then it is flogging elbows at resale prices. <br /><br />There is an absolutely fucking amazing business opportunity here for an entrepreneurial stoner or mom &amp; pop grow op to absolute dominate the SR market. You would run next to none of the risk that the chem boys do. Your markup would be equal to or greater than theirs. You would likely be working with your passions. Chance of being targeted by LEO for SR weed is slim to none. Product will fly out the door. Your reputation after being the one responsible for bringing down SR weed prices will not be questioned. I could go on... and on... and on... about it but anyone with half a brain see&#039;s it and knows they just have to put the bong down &amp; switch the lights on to get the ball rolling. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have the space available to safely run an op anymore and.... *sob* *sob* my main bush crop got flooded this year so I&#039;m just hoping to harvest enough to go a few months without buying the shit.

				I would be interested to see the opinion of a weed or recent former weed domestic Aus seller in this thread. I won&#039;t name anyone until they come forward, but I did talk to a seller recently who had stopped and he said weed just wasn&#039;t worth selling domestic anymore due to the cost of buying it, then the hassle of shipping, and the cost of laundering and converting btc. I guess street prices have gone up which doesn&#039;t help.<br /><br />Everything is crazy expensive in Australia, especially compared to the rest of the world. We are often paying double or more for the same products. It will be interesting to see what happens to our economy, clearly people can currently afford the higher prices and overall everything is going well. But I really don&#039;t think it can last. The stupidest thing is digital products even cost double here, that is nothing more than a screw Australia tax since it doesn&#039;t matter where in the world they are sold to.<br /><br />I have bought weed from OS before, and generally if you pick a respected buyer with good rep there is no problem. They conceal it well enough that it almost always gets through, and if you aren&#039;t importing a huge amount even if it does get detected customs will simply confiscate nothing more. Deny deny. Hopefully our market picks up again soon, but if not... Back OS.

				Well, as a weed vendor I thought I&#039;d come and have my input.<br />I just did 30 random posts in the newbie section, because the admins have taken 3 1/2 weeks (and counting) to upgrade my account to a vendor status account.<br /><br />What buyers don&#039;t understand is that I have to buy my product - I do not grow it myself. I have to spend thousands of dollars to buy the product.<br />Then on top of that, I have to buy everything necessary to package the orders. Then, the amount of time that goes into orders is a lot longer than you&#039;d expect. <br /><br />And I&#039;m here to make money, so I&#039;m not going to be spending time and taking the risk to do it for a very small profit. <br />Outside of SR, ounces would sell at $300 - a reasonable price, and that&#039;s pretty much the average price for 1 ounce. However on SR, there are SR fees (about $30 for 1ounce listing). Plus, the cost of the packaging materials. Plus the time it takes for orders. Then, I have to wait for the order to finalise, and there is ALOT of idiots who let it auto-finalise which is very unfair to me, and is why I can&#039;t get any more stock ATM. I need to wait for people&#039;s orders to finalise so I can access that money. Then there is the bitcoin exchange fees, and the costs of cashing out.<br />All of that adds up.<br /><br />You have to remember than outside of SR, a 1 ounce sale can be done in a matter of under one minute. The product gets weighed, put in a bag, and given to the buyer in exchange for cash. Done deal. It is no where near this easy on SR, and I would much prefer to sell 1 ounce outside of SR for $300 than selling 1 ounce on here for $350. It&#039;s so much easier. My prices will be going up when my listings are back up. I would like it if I didn&#039;t have to do this, but I&#039;m not going to continue doing this for the return I am currently getting. I&#039;m confident people will understand and I will still get sales. If not, then I will simply cease to sell on here. But it won&#039;t be worth me doing it if the prices don&#039;t go up a bit.<br /><br />I have had very high feedback and I go out of my way to ensure every customer is satisfied. Also, buy in bulk - it saves you money. 1gm is priced at $24, but if you buy 28 grams, it works out to be about $12 / gram. Much cheaper - It&#039;s priced like this to encourage buyers to buy larger packages so I don&#039;t send out loads of tiny orders, which all take time to process and package.<br /><br />I hope I have helped, and i hoe you understand why things are more expensive on SR than on the street. My listings should be up again within a week.<br /><br />Dingo<br />

				yeah all good mate... I get all that.&nbsp; You&#039;se are all just champ eh&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;m still don&#039;t understand why quantities are small though, I thought fee structures and risk would mean bigger quantities like 1/2 - 1 Oz would be better for vendors?&nbsp; And was also wondering why it all dried up recently..&nbsp; Just now there&#039;s only a handful of listings.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just an up and down thing.

				they can charge more for small amounts. like if you want a 500ml bottle of coke it&#039;s 90p or something and a 2 litres is £1.50. well in australia i&#039;m guessing it&#039;s more like $10 or something mental but you get what i mean. higher profit margins.

				<br />I&#039;d imagine it dried up quickly because there is incredible demand for weed, and the suppliers (including myself) just can&#039;t keep up. Buyers have no idea what it is like. Listings go up. Log in 10 hours later and there is 20 orders and the stock is nearly all sold out (thanks to the several large custom &amp; QP orders placed)<br />Whilst I have access to large quantities of weed, it&#039;s not unlimited. If it were unlimited, from what I&#039;ve seen I could easily sell 1kg+ per day.<br />When my listings were up last week, I had 1gm, 3.5gm, 7gm, 14gm, 28gm &amp; QP (113gm) listings. <br /><br />It just sells too fast. In my dreams, I would grow myself and have 5,000 plants set up, creating a pretty much infinite supply, and would sell minimum of 1 ounce per order.

It&#039;s extremely easy to get. A vast majority of the population would agree it&#039;s easier to buy ice than any other drug here.<br />It&#039;s because there is so much money made out of it. It sells for $100 / point (0.1gm), and heavy users go through that, or more in a day. And the dealers would be making at least $60 off each sale.<br /><br />It&#039;s locally made and imported. Both are common and it depends on the dealer. I&#039;d say more and more is being imported though nowadays (generally it&#039;s higher quality and cheaper to source).<br /><br />If there never was a &quot;war on drugs,&quot; things would be alot better than they are now. If amphetamine was legal, I can&#039;t imagine methamphetamine would be very popular. People would just settle for amp., which is no where near as addictive or harmful as ice - it even has beneifts for prescriptions already.
