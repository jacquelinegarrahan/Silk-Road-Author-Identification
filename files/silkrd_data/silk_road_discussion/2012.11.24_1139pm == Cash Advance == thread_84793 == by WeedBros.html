				The account balance lists USD because your account is set to hedge the BTC funds, i.e., you&#039;re guaranteed that USD value regardless of whether the price of BTC rises or falls while your money is in escrow. <br /><br />Frankly I don&#039;t see the point. You have to withdraw your funds in BTC anyway. It&#039;s just an extra few % out the window.<br /><br />Not sure about the cash advance problem. The sellers guide explains the details. Maybe hedging prevents the use of cash advance.

				Cash Advance - <br /><br />Is your escrow in USD or BTC?<br /><br />I only ask because I currently have escrow ONLY in USD ...and the Cash advance option is available to me.<br /><br />I have never used the Cash advance, so I can only hope that this info may help you.<br /><br /><br />

But BTC has to depreciate by more than 4% in that &lt;17 day period before hedging isn&#039;t throwing away money. It makes sense if you&#039;re expecting a precipitous fall I suppose. In a bull market it&#039;s a good way to cut your margins another 4% (SR fees are expensive enough). And who here isn&#039;t long on bitcoins?
