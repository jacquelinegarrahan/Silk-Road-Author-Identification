				1. Yeah I am aware that stuff is spelled with 2 Fs but I ran out of room. <br /><br />Anyway there are certain things we reeaaaaaally appreciate customers doing so please make sure ya do because if ya don&#039;t, to be frank, it&#039;s piss annoying lol. <br /><br />A) Asking us if you want us to use PGP - Yes, of course we want you to use PGP because it makes it safer for you. <br /><br />B) When you do the address, put your fuckin country in lol. It&#039;s annoying AS to either search it or message you about it. <br /><br />C) When you send your address don&#039;t put it in a spastic-style order. It should be like this- <br /><br />Name (FIRST/SECOND)<br />Number and Street<br />City<br />Region<br />Post Code/Zip Code/Whatever other jazzy name ya have for it<br />State/County/Region (if applicable)<br />Country<br /><br />D) When sending the address don&#039;t send it in lowercase because then I have to take a precious few seconds out of my life to correct that shit. If anything, put it all in caps or at least remember your capital letters. Laziness = Epic Fail<br /><br />E) When using encryption make sure you C+P that fucker right. I do like to go out raving but fuck me messaging people about stuff that don&#039;t decrypt is a song and dance I just find that just epitomizes tedium.<br /><br />F) If you are from a foreign country, please use the ENGLISH SPELLINGS because although it&#039;s going to you it&#039;s going through the U.K mail system first and some of those mother fuckers ain&#039;t too smart I&#039;m afraid. It makes it easier for everyone. <br /><br />G) If I haven&#039;t dispatched your package yet don&#039;t message me over and over again asking why not, has something happened or if the world is about to explode and the sky is about to fall on your head or even worse if your colon will suddenly work in reverse so your shits will all of a sudden come back up through your mouth. I will do your package and dispatch it eventually and if I haven&#039;t yet there is 99% of the time a very good reason but it&#039;s just not something that needs to be discussed. <br /><br />If I think of anymore I&#039;ll add them later. <br /><br />That is all.<br /><br />Lim :)<br />

				Yeah, I realized I forgot to include my country after I sent you my address. I had just copied and pasted it from when I sent it to some US vendors right before and completely spaced out, sorry about that mate! :-[

I know where everything is there and most of the Western countries but it&#039;s places that are spelled like this - Blksfoefo;da;lbfilfi;ri;fbi that I don&#039;t have as clue on. <br /><br />The ones that personally get right on my tits are C, D, E, and G lol. A and F aren&#039;t so bad but it helps in general.

				Whenever I order, I just visit this link.<br />www.usps.com/zip4<br />I look up a decent address to send it too, type in the info and it makes it all nice and formatted for me. All I need to do is come up with the name and type in the country and I&#039;m good. I&#039;m not sure if it makes a difference including the postal code but I like to use it anyways. I always use all caps as well because it makes things so much easier. :)

I mean writing your address wrong is forgivable I suppose, but not really seeing as anyone with half a brain would check it thoroughly, but even so its understandable. But writing your address wrong and then expecting a refund? I&#039;d perma ban people like that. Stupidity on a colossal scale

				To be fair I do all sorts of idiotic shit sometimes. Like the other day I nearly left my wallet in a shop and I had 2K in it and it&#039;s only coz some kid was decent enough to run and get me that I didn&#039;t end up having a very shit day. The fact is though if I&#039;d had done that I&#039;d have had nobody else apart from my dumb-ass self. Drugs are just one of these odd areas in life where people don&#039;t wana accept responsibility because THEY CAN&#039;T GET HIGH. However that sorta conflicts with the fact with the vendors point of view where we don&#039;t give a shit lol.

				Good post. Ive never sent an order making any of the mistakes you mentioned, but its interesting to hear about some of the issues vendors have to deal with while selling here on SR. I dont have the patience, and i sure as fuck wouldnt want to have to deal with that type of shit on a reg basis. Ive been taking you vendors for granted lately, but this post reminded me how much i appreciate you guys for putting up with the newbies and tards, lol and for supplying the masses with everybodys favorites. Thanks limet and all vendors.<br /><br />

				Lol see I can reasonably account for my funds so that is never actually much of an issue. I did actually give that kid £30 for being a good lad and bringing my wallet too me without nicking anything. I&#039;m a subscriber that if you get rewarded for being honest when you are young (he was only a young lad, no more than 12) then you it influences you to be honest when you are older. I checked the count after I got back in me car as well and he hadn&#039;t taken anything out of it. What a star. <br /><br />And yeah you&#039;d be surprised man, tbh it doesn&#039;t bother me if you make a mistake on the address. Not my problem. The stuff that does annoy me is the stuff that takes up my time like having to edit address and get PGP stuff resent. It&#039;s long.

				No, the very worst are the ones who don&#039;t finalise when they get the delivery. <br /><br />The most annoying thing that sellers do is requesting FE. I don&#039;t like it when sellers try and take away my only recourse to being scammed or having my order not arrive. <br />

				For the record Mr Lim, I only asked 3 times why haven&#039;t you put my order into trasit! I mean when I want an armoured personnel carrier with custom rims and stealth weaponry I want it NOW. FFS is that too much to ask? Yea your busy but I have shit to do also and I really need that vehicle sooner rather than later.<br />Happy to be shot down Lim but given I even FE for that son bitch the least you could have done was communicate. How the fuck was I to know you where waiting on the custom rims? I mean fuck my crystal ball was on the blink sorry. At what dollar value is a customer treated like a customer? Just curious!

Anyway, I have to admit I&#039;ve forgotten my country a few times myself lol, but fuck me I would never just do some of the brainless crap some buyers do with vendors lol.

				I write addresses in upper and lower case as the UK and old Europe postal systems can read printed addresses with ease - its computerized and high tech stuff.<br /><br />As for PGP I am learning that as I am getting a vendor established here and she has no clue about computers but is a whizz at money and already learnt how to mine the bitcoins and how to safety turn bitcoins into real cash mainly buying off other vendors a seoection og top quality substances. <br /><br />I have orders that are maybe more than personal. I make a few pounds and the buyer saves a few pounds and gets a certified top quality whatever.<br /><br />So, I&#039;m not buying anything or dealing with vendors who who do not insist buyers use PGP. <br /><br />It is selfish for buyers to be blase about transactions. Its not just them/us at risk, the carelessness of buyers is a weak spot in the system we use here. <br /><br />The PGP dummies guides will teach us all how to protect ourselves better,<br /><br />and protecting this site is a priority for many here.

				I got nervous when I made my first transaction, because I just typed my address, encrypted it, cut and pasted it.&nbsp; It&#039;s more than just type it, check it, and submit, so I thought if I misspelled the original cleartext, I wouldn&#039;t know once it&#039;s encrypted.&nbsp; anyway, I was careful regardless, and the order was a total success.<br /><br />Since then, I&#039;ve &quot;polished&quot; my address by making it seem more professional (or &quot;less shady&quot; if you will).&nbsp; I put Dr. in front of my name ;-), and used a middle initial.&nbsp; I also ran my address through the USPS validator thing.&nbsp; it helps with routing by adding the 4-digit sub-zip-code, but it also &quot;cleans&quot; the other parts.&nbsp; Like, apparantly &quot;Circle&quot; should be written as CIR, with no period, and a few other things.&nbsp; <br /><br />So now that I have my final, solid, polished address, I saved it in a cleartext file, and simply encrypt it for every order I place.&nbsp; So I know I&#039;m not putting any typos into the address, and as long as the vendor can decrypt it without issue, I know it&#039;s 100% correct.&nbsp; 45 transactions placed using this method, and not a single issue with my address.&nbsp; (+2 transactions from before I started using this technique, all successful *knock on wood*).&nbsp; Also I always laugh when people talk about &quot;asking if they should use PGP&quot;.&nbsp; I say just fucking use it!&nbsp; In the worst case, your vendor is an incompetent fool (who you shouldn&#039;t be talking to anyway), and it the best case, everything happens business as usual.&nbsp; Why on earth would you bother to waste a vendors time asking if you should use PGP?&nbsp; That always makes me chuckle...<br /><br />But, seriously Lim, this is a great thread.&nbsp; I like to think that I have a good head on my shoulders, and I like to double-triple-check things to make sure they&#039;re right, but it&#039;s never a bad idea to give a friendly reminder like this thread is intended.&nbsp; Some people are just totally oblivious that vendors are real people and that they can get really frustrated just like anyone else.&nbsp; In this area, everyone needs to always remember that the vendors are what makes this place great.&nbsp; I get the impression that some buyers think they are all high and mighty, just by being here, and that they can do fuck-all whatever they want, and the vendors will &quot;Just take care of it&quot; because thats their job.&nbsp; Well I say FUCK THAT!!!&nbsp; To those ungrateful fucktards, I say it&#039;s your job to not be such fucking idiotd that you can&#039;t tell someone your actual correct address where you want things to be sent to.&nbsp; I mean jesus fucking christ...it&#039;s common sense, but I guess thats too much to ask for some people...

				is that the top things vendors hate? or could you tell us the absolute most annoying things newbs do besides fuck up the address, that will keep us from causing too many problems?&nbsp; i mean not like write a book about it, but the main things you see over and over and wish would go away. i think that everyone should know by now not to harass vendors with a-hole constant messaging, to pgp, to write the address in correct format, to read and research before questioning, and generally to not be a wanker about their order, prices, discounts, other assorted stupid shite,&nbsp; ...but im sure there must be a few things that bear repeating so jackass mistakes wont keep turning up. i read the address post with growing dismay, so what else ya got before i f that up too.&nbsp; :o

				hey there guys and gals, <br />i am about as fresh as they come here on the road - Im trying to read up as much as i can before i place my first order which will be as soon as safely possible.&nbsp; here are some questions regarding this here thread, maybe someone can enlighten me before i cause any unwanted stress and trouble to my future vendors...<br />1) does everybody require pm&#039;s to be in PGP? <br />2) what is the difference between encryption and PGP?<br />and last but not least- the big question<br />3) perhaps someone can paste me a link to a thread that explains, in detail,&nbsp; the order process....I just reluctant to begin a thread asking a question that just about every new member probably asks, and has got to be repeated over and over again on here. Maybe Im just not seeing it yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Im eager to get the ball rolling here, but I am wary of being inappropriate and vague... certainly don&#039;t want to make a bad name for myself before I realize what exactly it is that Im doing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:-[
