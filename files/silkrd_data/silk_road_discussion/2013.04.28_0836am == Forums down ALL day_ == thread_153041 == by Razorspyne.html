				What&#039;s the score on this, are we back or not? I&#039;ve had persistent difficulty all day, and logged in but couldn&#039;t log out again. Those few who are logged in (14 earlier) are you able to browse the forums or is everything timing out for you as well?<br /><br />It hasn&#039;t been like this since February. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I&#039;ve upgraded to a fast connection and it still took me about 4-6 clicks of Refresh button, and sometimes I hit the <br /><br />Connection Problems<br />Sorry, SMF was unable to connect to the database. This may be caused by the server being busy. Please try again later. <br /><br />Yes someone told me SR marketplace was down as well. Slow loading, then it went completely. I gave up hours ago, but now I am starting to miss the forums and want it up again. :-\ ....eventually.

				Jeez.... I have only just been able to load pages just now, despite being logged in since this began.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153041.msg1061482#msg1061482">Quote from: nanpa2001 on April 28, 2013, 12:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It doesn&#039;t feel like a DDOS attack to me.

It looks like a problem with the database or something on the server side.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, it was able to connect for me too after about 6 clicks, but got steadily worse for me until it was unusable, even javascript didn&#039;t load when it did finally connect after about 6 agonizingly slow clicks. It works for now though. Hm, like TorMail? TorMail is always down and someone in SEC. section said it could be DB or server problems, so I guess it could be the same here, but not really sure.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

On the upside, while those not logged into forums can&#039;t log in, those who are currently logged in can get patchy service but to be honest, best to make a pina colada while we are waiting and keep checking it every 30 minutes. <br /><br />I think it is better than in February.
