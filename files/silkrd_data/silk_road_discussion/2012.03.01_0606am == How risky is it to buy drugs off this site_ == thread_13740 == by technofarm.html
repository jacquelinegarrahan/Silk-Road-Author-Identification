				If you take all of the proper security measures and arm yourself with knowledge (i.e. read the forums and seller&#039;s reviews), it is safer than purchasing off the streets.&nbsp; The busts are happening on the streets and IRL.&nbsp; Not here.&nbsp; Not to say that won&#039;t change someday.&nbsp; But I&#039;m optimistic.

				just make sure the trail of bitcoins isnt going to be super easy to trace, point a to b, they dont have much money and effort to exert to catch you buying a small personal amount of mdma, so just dont make it easy for them... make sure you encrypt your address for example.<br /><br />also, a word of advice, it will seem sketch but you dont want to waste the vendors and your time and money, so use a real name and address. if not, the package may not be delivered<br /><br />if you are interested in a well established vendor whose products are considered among the best on the Road, I would look into tony76<br /><br />Welcome, stay safe!

				A way of encrypting communication so only its intended receiver can read it. Preferably it should be used for all communication. It should ALWAYS be used when you send your address to a vendor though.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0

				As long as you are only buying small amounts, no problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;Just take precautions, what I do is:<br /><br />Never have drugs at address they are delivered, picked up from mailbox and consumed elsewhere.<br />Have tor on a usb key (I haven&#039;t encrypted), and keep well hidden, preferably somewhere outside the premises.<br />If police ever come (very unlikely) just say , wtf , and say you nothing about it. Be polite it helps.&nbsp; If hasselled a lot get a lawyer.<br /><br />I prefer international vendors, because they cannot be posing as LE officers, and generally small amount caught up in customs aren&#039;t chased up, they are generally doing 100 gm +, cases, the worst that will probably happen is a stern letter.<br /><br />Order and enjoy, when you think about much safer than purchasing from those scarey streets.

				GOD YOU GUYS ARE MAKING ME PARANOID NOW. GRR.<br /><br />guys guys guys you keep saying large orders are more likely to get caught... how large are we talking? someone please answer thisi need to know im new too. are we talking weight or cost in money/btc or whatever? Like is 10 grams a large ammount? Would 20 pills of MDMA be a lot? Would 90 pills of generic ritalin be a lot? These are all personal stashes but is it considered a lot?? And are we talking about all the orders put together, how many grams they all equal together even if they are diffrent items/drugs? Also is it true the more items you get sent to you&nbsp; from different people (trusted people) you are more likely&nbsp; to get caught? My ex-boyfriend who was a tweaker was convinced if he placed more than three orders at once than the cops would come. I also disagree that if you use your real address your gunna get caught... ex bf has been using SR for a long timee and sending it straight up to his apartment or house and hes been fine...<br /><br />Well before I read all these responses my advice for this is that life is full of risks. And whether you want to accept it or not your taking a risk, its not just SR though, you take risks all the time. I personally know what Im doing is &#039;wrong&#039; and thing is you have to decide yourself if its worth it or not (i feel this is very philosophical thing on if you will risk your freedom to have freedom to all items)... Of course I dont want something to happen to me but ive come to terms that you know, if something did happen, i probably deserved it and new it was coming eventually. I have no reason to be paranoid right now about the feds and I have used my real address and haven&#039;t done all that PGP sht and gotten orders safely and on time... I mean honestly its kind of hard to track and its really time consuming to open a case on someone. <br /><br /><br />Also I dont think ive ever heard or read or seen or in any way been told about anyone getting the cops called on them or something. Anyone else? Uh probably urban legend to scare kids away.

				Technofarm, here are a couple of links you may find useful:<br /><br />This is a Q&amp;A thread from a postal service intern (in the US). It&#039;s super interesting just to read and helped allay some of my fears. Knowledge is power!<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.0<br /><br />A user called Fred Flintstone wrote this straightforward guide which takes you through every step of placing an order:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14104.0<br /><br />If you go on the main SR site there&#039;s also a wiki that has lots of helpful information as well. :)
