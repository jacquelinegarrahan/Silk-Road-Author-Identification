				Yes, many minutes to load one single page, and I ain&#039;t on no dialup either.<br /><br />Does anybody know if ddos attacks could be causing this?

				Make sure your TOR is updated...if&nbsp; you are running .25-5 and not .25-6 then it is very slow.<br /><br />If you are running .25-6 it is at normal speed.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />People this should not be that hard to figure out. KEEP YOUR TOR UPDATED FOR MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE OF SR.

Since you are new..you don&#039;t realize how many stupid people we have in here. Not saying you are one of them 8) BUT there are a lot...and they will not have the most up to date TOR. I mean there are actually morons in here&nbsp; who do not use tor to connect to SR!!! As insane as that is...I mean I can&#039;t even imagine someone is that stupid...then again I totally know they are as I get questions that prove it every single hour. So in the future when you read something...and you do not like it...don&#039;t comment...just assume it was not meant for you.<br />

				Again, Update Tor you have to keep in line with the network, this is the number 1 course of connection issues and some times on windows you will need to delete the old copy before extracting the new one to the same directory, or it acts like its done it but you still have the same geomap file, not the new one.

				I don&#039;t know if you guys are just thinking its going faster or something. But I&#039;ve updated tor. Restarted computer. <br /><br />Somethings going on thats causing it to be so slow. Maybe just an overload of people. But its hard to think just a week ago it was running lightning fast.<br /><br />It&#039;s also odd that right after it went down for the night after DPR &#039;smelled something fishy&#039; and now its loading slow as hell.<br /><br />Also there hasn&#039;t been any input from any mods or DPR since its been going slow... it&#039;s literally loading so slow I&#039;m having trouble packing orders because I can&#039;t get peoples fucking addresses!<br /><br />Hope it gets resolved soon =\<br /><br /><br />TH
