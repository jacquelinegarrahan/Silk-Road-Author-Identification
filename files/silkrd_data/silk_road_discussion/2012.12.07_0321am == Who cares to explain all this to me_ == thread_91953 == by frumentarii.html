				The only frame of reference I have for all this is Suarez&#039;s Daemon and Freedom (tm). To say this isn&#039;t what I expected would be inaccurate, as I discovered this all approximately... today. So, honestly, three questions:<br /><br />How the hell does this all work (SR, and Tor Hidden services) You&#039;ve got blatant buying and selling of incredibly illegal things... you&#039;ve got contract killers... you&#039;ve got all sorts of crazy stuff. And yet it seems like this site has existed for quite some time. What gives?<br /><br />How the hell do you guys coexist? I mean, you&#039;ve got relatively normal guys who just want to get a fix, or a fake ID, or a bootleg TDKR copy, and then you&#039;ve got fucking pedophiles. Is it just a non-judgmental kind of thing, or do you try to pretend they don&#039;t exist, or...?<br /><br />If my IP was found (answers to no.1 notwithstanding) to have gone to this site (not for illegal activity, just to look around), what kind of trouble would I be in?

				SR is all a network where people work together and buy and sell merchandise. However, that&#039;s not all it does. The forums are a good place to get to know other people, get your questions answered and also help others. You keep speaking of contract killers and pedophiles. I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about there so I&#039;ll just leave it that.<br /><br />If you&#039;re IP is magically discovered by who I don&#039;t know, I&#039;d imagine you&#039;d be fine. You&#039;re just looking on a website. However if you&#039;re that concerned about that you&#039;re stay isn&#039;t going to be very good here.<br /><br />HighAllDay96<br /><br />Luke

Cant have one without the other, and them being here can also be a good sign, cos those groups are probably much more security aware than most here, and would run away faster if at risk as they have much more to lose. I guess I feel safer knowing those more criminal groups feel safe here too. Also there&#039;s prolly alot more childporn (and prolly other &#039;bad&#039; stuff) elsewhere than on TOR, like Freenet and i2p. <br /><br />These things are also parts of our societies that doesnt seem to be going away by itself either, no matter how much governments try suppress it out of public sight, and is just as much a part of our world as everything else and is there for a reason, may rather be a symptom of other problems (?) than much of a problem in itself. I think it may be a good thing they have a somewhat public place like this to freely express themselves<br /><br />I guess it depends on your local laws, but I don&#039;t think anywhere forbids browsing this place, or TOR, tho some governments (like China?) may try to block access to it. Think it was mainly meant for journalists,dissidents etc. to communicate securely, and your doings here cant be proven as traffic is encrypted over .onion domains..check top links for more info. Im not sure about the laws, but I&#039;d guess that if you visit a site with childporn, you are technically &quot;downloading&quot; it (thru ur browsers cache?) by viewing it, and may possibly be punished if proven?<br /><br />

				I cannot properly praise the Silk Road in a single post. I would need a whole novel to get it done. The best advice I can give to you is to join the community, make a purchase, and you&#039;ll quickly understand how everything works so beautifully. Welcome to paradise!

				All of this is not new, you know.<br /><br />It always has and always will. Type of media changes. But for example: drugs have always been send through mail/by Internet. And pedophiles have and still use private newsgroups.<br /><br />And yes, there are many pro&#039;s and con&#039;s. But all of those are subjective.<br />I think it&#039;s good that SR exists. Well organized, usually good products, etc.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in shock, then just know that this is not something new. I&#039;m not even sure it&#039;s easier or not than previously used channels. It&#039;s more secure though, IF you use your brains.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like what you see. Perhaps it&#039;s better to shut your eyes again and live in a bubble. The world IS dark, and this now there is darkNET.<br /><br />Take care.

				You don&#039;t necessarily have to &quot;co-exist&quot; with other people on SR. To buy and sell there you don&#039;t even need to be on the forum. The only interactions you may have are with vendors, who are generally very professional and not the junky or shady type at all.<br /><br />I would bet to say someone could get most anything they needed for personal use without having to talk to any vendor, only sending their address.

				SR has been a positive experience for me. There are bad people everywhere. I feel secure here though and believe people adhere to a code of conduct and have respect for one another. It&#039;s great to have the freedom to be yourself and not be judged. <br />ML.
