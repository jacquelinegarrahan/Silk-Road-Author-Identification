				Interesting idea, you should put this in the Feature Request forum. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think vendors are going to like it too much though as they want the highest ratings possible. Of course if everyone gets 5/5 then ratings become meaningless so maybe you&#039;re onto something.

				Or, finalize and just don&#039;t leave any rating at all until you get the product/try it? You can leave or amend feedback at any time, so there&#039;s really no need to do it at all. <br /><br />It&#039;s not fair to vendors at ALL to leave 3/5 because it messes up their stats (even if it&#039;s just temporary), and may slow down their business if the buyer doesn&#039;t see the FE&#039;s are the reason for their low score. On the flip side, leaving 5/5 for a FE isn&#039;t necessarily fair to buyers either as it may give sellers undue credit; however, one bad rating hurts a seller more than one good rating helps them.

				what about if it goes to auto-finalization? if somebody couldn&#039;t be bothered to get around to finalizing, they sure as hell aren&#039;t going to come back to amend the feedback.&nbsp; Other than that i think it&#039;s a pretty good idea. Maybe auto-finalizes could be an exception that automatically goes to a 5/5

I got scammed by Juergen since people FE and don&#039;t say anything or change the Feedback after being scammed.&nbsp; He&#039;s still rated at 93 while he continues to selectively scam people. At least i learned a lesson, and at a relatively low price luckily.

The only legitimate reason why a vendor should ask someone to FE is if the buyer is new without any transactions or the buyer has a REALLY high refund/auto finalization rate.<br /><br />I see lots of vendors making buyers FE because they use the excuse of &quot;I need the funds to purchase more drugs to sell to buyers&quot; ...if a vendor can&#039;t afford or manage their money right then they shouldn&#039;t be a vendor in the first place. A lot of the top vendors on here don&#039;t make buyers FE and have no problem selling mass quantities of drugs without needing buyers to FE to free up money.<br /><br />A smart vendor will take into account that every now and then they&#039;re going to have a buyer that tries to scam them and they&#039;ll figure in the costs of such transactions.

				Why not a choice in the ratings section that is &#039;Finalized Early&#039; and wouldn&#039;t count towards the seller rating? Could even include on the profile the number of FEs that a seller has had for a period of time, say 2 weeks. Would still require people to actually go back and change the review once they get the package, but you can&#039;t make lazy people do anything. <br /><br />I suppose some sort of notification that prompts you to change the review that pops up on the main page could be done, and would help remind those who are to forgetful (or stoned) to go back and write a proper review.<br /><br />One could always go through the seller feedback and count up the number of FEs, but SRs load times + missing review pages make looking at past reviews a bit of a chore.

				Some excellent points made guys in the previous posts. The simplest and smartest thing for buyers to do is NEVER FINALIZE EARLY FOR ANY VENDOR OR FOR ANY REASON, EVEN FOR SO CALLED &quot;TRUSTED VENDORS&quot;, FULL STOP!! Stay in Escrow and have peace of mind that you won&#039;t lose all your Bitcoins. :)

				While I take your point, IMO, it really is a pointless objective to ask buyer&#039;s to change their feedback. The issue is that after a week or two has passed and the buyer is ready to change their feedback (either having finally received their order or gone through the resolution process), it&#039;s on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th page of the vendor&#039;s feedback. I&#039;ll bet there aren&#039;t too many buyer&#039;s who go back a few pages looking at the vendor&#039;s feedback. Most would look at the first page and the 10 or so most recent feedback scores and comments written on it when deciding which vendor to use. I will never understand anyone who chooses to FE. I know it&#039;s their choice if they choose to do so but why, why take a risk that you don&#039;t have to take? ???

				i agree, dont FE in the first place<br /><br />but if you decide to, you shouldnt mess up a vendors rating because you made the choice to FE<br /><br />too many people fail to return and edit their feedback, so this would mess up the entire feedback system. if they leave 5/5 but the package doesnt show they are far more motivated to return and edit the feedback... <br /><br />i personally agree with the member who mentioned you simply shouldnt leave any feedback after FE. you dont have to leave feedback until the order arrives, and they havent earned that score yet anyway<br /><br />once the order arrives, then you can go back to your order page and submit the feedback

				To your first point - you can FE without leaving a rating and wait for your package to arrive.<br />Second point - you can amend you feedback if you have already left feedback, but clicking on your account, top of the screen - where it shows how much change is in your purse, than once in your account on the right hand side says &#039;feedback&#039;, you can go in there and see all the feedback you have left and there is an amend button for each individual feedback.<br /><br />Hope that helps.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-*

Very few buyers go back past the first page looking at a vendor&#039;s most recent feedback when placing an order and invariably will miss reading the amended feedbacks. This is again another reason to look for vendors who use the Escrow system.

				This is a good idea in theory, in reality the seller would message you telling you to 5/5 FE, otherwise there&#039;s no deal. <br /><br />However, there is a way to get around this: be sneaky. Say ok to the seller, and when he has shipped your order, a few days later, edit your feedback to 3 / 5, while waiting for the package to show up, then uprate your feedback when the package shows up. <br /><br />I don&#039;t like to be sneaky but if that&#039;s the only way to stop the FE madness, let&#039;s do it. Ideally, SR would have to forbid FE.

				just FE and give 5/5 and change it accordingly, its not rocket science, and also not fair on the vendor to get less than a 5/5 unless they deserve it. plus there&#039;s enough people as it is who never come back and change their feedback after finalizing early, why should the vendor suffer for buyers being lazy and not changing their feedback?<br /><br />&nbsp;if it bothers you that much, use a vendor that doesn&#039;t require FE.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s been stressed enough that if you do decide to finalize early, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LEAVE IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK! If more people realize this, then vendors can get their funds faster, in addition to providing the service offered lest they intend to receive negative feedback for non-delivery/poor quality.

				Basically the way the rating system is setup right now it is gamed towards vendors being able to scam buyers. If someone FE&#039;s and then leaves feedback, that feedback, as I understand it, is timestamped at the time they FE. So if they do get ripped off and eventually adjust their feedback, it is going to be buried behind a boatload of 5/5 FE&#039;s and most people aren&#039;t going to look back through a month of feedback to find the reality of someone not getting their drugs today.<br /><br />Personally I think it&#039;s up to the vendor if they want to require FE or not. If it works for them then so be it I guess. The whole idea here is we have a market place where we get to choose our vendors. I won&#039;t and haven&#039;t bought anything that requires FE so some vendors are loosing customer&#039;s just like some customer&#039;s who choose not to FE are loosing potential vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br />What would be nice though is if the feedback system was adjusted so that those that FE can get feedback into the system relevant to the date of product arrival or non-arrival. If someone starts to scam, seeing three pages of 5/5 FE&#039;s in front of a bunch of 1/5 I got scammed and it sucks feedback makes the system a little uneven.<br /><br />Just my two cents

				As pointed out before, you can finalize without leaving any rating.<br />Once you finalized, just click on Joe or any other link instead of submitting feedback.<br /><br />Apart from that - don&#039;t finalize unless you live on the other side of the world or in russia or something. <br />Any vendor requesting you to FE without a real reason is a scammer. All of them. Every single one.<br /><br />FE actually hurts vendors and helps scammers, because any refunds given to someone who finalized won&#039;t show up on his record. That&#039;s why no sane vendor will ever ask you to FE unless he has no intention of refunding you..

				Honestly it&#039;s kind of sad that no one has posted this idea. Wipe out FE entirely, make escrow mandatory.

Seriously, anybody who FE for ANY reason is taking a risk that they just don&#039;t have to&nbsp; ???. It makes absolutely NO SENSE at all to FE for anyone. Some buyers need to use their head and not be sucked into some of the deals promised by some vendors if they do FE. Escrow is in place for the protection of both parties. If each one fulfills there part of the transaction, all will be fine but should a problem arise, at least if a resolution can&#039;t be reached by both parties, SR Support can make a decision based on the facts and any evidence presented to them. That, IMO, is at least a fair and equitable resolution to any problem which may occur instead of the alternative of FE, where a buyer is purely at the mercy of the vendor with regards to any type of refund/reship or resolution. Buyers need to realize that there is NO SUCH THING as a &quot;trusted vendor&quot; or a &quot;trustworthy vendor&quot; when your using an anonymous market on the Hidden Web. That&#039;s not to say that excellent, professional vendors are not operating on SR, because they definitely are, but one just never can be sure, hence the purpose of the SR Escrow system and why buyers need to utilize it. One last thing to remember,&nbsp; buyer&#039;s also need to understand that by FE, SR views that as you having received your order and are satisfied with it all, almost like a receipt if you like. Once you finalize the order, SR Support will NOT help you at all, FULL STOP.

				The feedback system has the potential to accurately identify the trustworthiness of all sellers - Both FE and non FE - it just requires that accurate feedback is left.<br />Maybe FE transactions should have feedback set by default as &quot;pending&quot; to ensure buyers are aware that they still need to leave feedback rather than risk the situation at present which is buyers getting skewed feedback because buyers are too ignorant or too lazy to update feedback allready left.<br />Their is nothing wrong per se buying FE so long as the seller is trustworthy - after all you dont order your shopping online from tescos and only expect to pay for it after you have eaaten it.<br />If i was selling i would be disinclined to proceed on the basis that i was at the mercy of the buyer if i got ripped off.<br />

Ordering illegal products on an anonymous market found on the Hidden Web is a completely different situation altogether. If I buy something and pay for it before I receive it, the vendor could ship me anything and suddenly disappear off the face of the earth, never to be seen again or in some cases, resurface as a new vendor with a new name.

				FE should not be included in the sellers stats.( perhaps a tick box option as to why....New customer etc.) It should read as a seperate number. eg :SPPA(99) (25). So 25% of my sales are FE&#039;d but hold no rating and dont affect the overall %. Whatever is the consensus on here, it will be hard to implement a totally new system now, as it would effectively cause all the vendors to go back to 0.<br />&nbsp;I think this would put more emphasis on the customer to do his research and make an informed decision. After all it is a buyers market and I agree with what this thread is saying. If we collectively as a whole start to boycote the FE then hopefully it will be only used for the very first time buyer, ordering samples to build his stats<br /><br />It peeves me when I see people finalise, give 5/5 but have not even tried the product<br />perhaps the stats shown next to their name should be overall rating for received goods, so at a glimse the number would represent how many parcels have been recieved.i.e 100 % success. So FE would not affect this total. and on the particular goods page you can see the review for that product.<br />Also if FE your order still remains visable. so you are aware you need to fill in a review WHEN your goods have arrived<br />SPPA (99) (25)<br />so 99% of my orders have reached its destination&nbsp; ( obviously in cases of resolution it can be amended by admin when an aoutcome is reached), 25% of my orders have FE&#039;d<br />You look at a particular product, say 1g white widow, there you can see all the reviews for that strand only. there I can see what people actually think of that product.<br />This way customers wont be scared into giving no less than 5/5 as it wont affect the overall stats of the vendor, but allows you to be honest

I totally understand a vendor&#039;s view point where some buyers are only out to scam vendors for some free drugs, constantly creating new accounts and pretending their orders haven&#039;t arrived. As a buyer, that really pisses me off as it affects how we, genuine buyers, are perceived in the eyes of some vendors through no fault of our own. Vendors can take some preventative measures to counteract this such as, for example, limiting the amount newbie&#039;s can purchase in a single transaction until they reach a certain number of purchases. The only risk to a vendor having money in Escrow is either from SR being taken down or DPR doing a runner. The latter isn&#039;t going to happen IMO because it&#039;s a constant income stream making some serious coin. I&#039;m not for one minute pretending it couldn&#039;t or will never happen,&nbsp; but I highly doubt DPR would ever kill the goose that layed, and is still laying, the golden egg. That just doesn&#039;t make any sense to me and coupled with his/her&#039;s proven loyalty and dedication to remain and fight for what they believe in, fighting through and prevailing after some minor issues and hacks, leaves me in no doubt Escrows biggest hurdle is LE infiltration. DPR has done an amazing job in maintaining the security and anonymity of this hidden service. One can only hope he/she remains a step ahead of the authorities for a long time to come. As it stands, Escrow is the safest and fairest option for all concerned and while each side will have some issues with particular aspects of the system, it&#039;s currently all we have until a better idea or system, prevails.&nbsp;

If I buy something, pay for it and find a problem with what I ordered, I can return it and ask for a replacement or a refund. If I have problems doing so, I can then ask a particular Government Organization/Department to step in on my behalf as the retailer would be breaking a law by not selling a product fit for purchase or able to be used as it should be. Ordering illegal products on an anonymous market found on the Hidden Web is a completely different situation altogether. If I buy something and pay for it before I receive it, the vendor could ship me anything and suddenly disappear off the face of the earth, never to be seen again or in some cases, resurface as a new vendor with a new name. I&#039;d be up shit creek without a paddle and could kiss my coins good bye. Your comparing apples with oranges IMO.<br /><br />The current feedback system would work fine if buyers left feedback when they received their orders and didn&#039;t FE. It&#039;s as simple as that.

A trustworthy seller is only trustworthy till he goes bad. Why risk it ? Never FE.<br />From a seller perspective every non FE transaction you are at the mercy of the buyer ripping you off. One can understand why sellers prefer FE particularly with new customers.<br />Where buyers are persuaded into FE then feedback is their only leverage to ensure honest delivery so making FE feedback &quot;pending&quot; would at least give the seller incentive to supply and remind the buyer to leave accurate feedback on completion.<br />

				The problem with the whole feedback issue relating to buyers FE is there is only room for 10 feed backs to be left on each page. By the time a buyer is ready to edit their feedback, it&#039;s probably 2-4 pages back and no longer on the vendor&#039;s actual home page.

				So would you say it&#039;s OK to leave 3/5 with a little message as long as you definitely go back and amend when the business is concluded? In my opinion, if you have to FE, placing a temporary 3/5 or 4/5 is fair because they shouldn&#039;t be asking for FE to begin with and at the time the feedback is left it is an honest reflection of the service so far. You can&#039;t tell me everybody is happy with FE. I&#039;ve seen countless vendor profiles with a 100% rating and they&#039;ve got nothing but FE notes in the feedback so giving them a temporary drop in the ratings would make people think twice before ordering (YKKZipper for example).
