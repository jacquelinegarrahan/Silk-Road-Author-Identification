Entering &#039;hedge&#039; or &#039;hedging&#039; in there will magically pull up lots of answers to any question you might have so as the forums don&#039;t get clogged up with questions that have been answered a thousand times already. It&#039;s revolutionary!<br /><br />These forums are the first to implement this so-called &quot;Search bar&quot; anywhere on the whole internet!!! There&#039;s even a company called Gogger or Google, I&#039;m not sure which, that are trying to steal it and enable people to search for things using something called a web browser.<br />How outrageous is that!?<br /><br />Or you could, y&#039;know, go past the first goddamn page of the forum and find a thread with a very similar question on page 3 which would have answered yours.&nbsp; ::) I&#039;ll link that below just in case you get lost trying to find it:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=139480.0<br /><br />Hell, you could even read the Silk Road Wiki or the Buyer&#039;s and Seller&#039;s guides to find answers instead of demanding to be spoon-fed like a droopy-eyed armless infant.<br /><br />Silk Road Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Silk Road Buyer&#039;s guide:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide<br /><br />Silk Road Seller&#039;s guide:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide<br /><br />My apologies for the &#039;rant&#039;, but seriously, c&#039;mon; you&#039;re not 5 years old anymore. You can presumably feed yourself, so start feeding yourself information that is incredibly easy to find instead of cluttering the forums with pointless threads.<br /><br />Also, judging by your post history, your time would perhaps have been better spent researching how transactions on Silk Road work and getting answers to your questions rather than spamming the forums to get to 50 posts:<br />&quot;... just want[ing] to get closer to the main posting forum&quot; (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120474.msg948252#msg948252) is a bit silly when you simply want to clog the forums with questions that have been answered a number of times previously, wouldn&#039;t you agree?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; Even hearing stuff you may not want to hear is helpful.&nbsp; I appreciate your comments.&nbsp; I am just frustrate that MT. GOVX has all my bitcoins and won&#039;t let me move them here so I can make a purchase and no longer appear like a lurker.&nbsp; Well there is more info you probably didn&#039;t wish to know.
