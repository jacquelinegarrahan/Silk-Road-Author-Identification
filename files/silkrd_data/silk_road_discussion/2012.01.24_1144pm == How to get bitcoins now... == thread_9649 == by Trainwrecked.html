				Okay, so I see there&#039;s a new issue with Moneypak now?&nbsp; Listen, I got cash.&nbsp; I need to find a vendor or something so I can buy some bitcoins like tonight.&nbsp; The sad thing on why it&#039;s taken me so long to do this, is every way I find to buy bitcoins requires time and waiting on it that frankly, I just don&#039;t have.&nbsp; Anyone know of any legit vendors or ways to get bitcoins that don&#039;t require time and waiting like a week to get?

				I just used a MP to get some. What&#039;s the issue? I know there has been talk about not being able to use them in the future, but they are still working just fine. Until you can&#039;t use them, I&#039;m pretty sure you aren&#039;t going to find an easier way.

				the problem is some people are raising hysteria about green dot denying a moneypak after someone put a bunch of money on it.&nbsp; this was in a couple news articles and as far as I know nobody on here has had any problems with it.&nbsp; All the MP &gt; BTC vendors are still doing business and don&#039;t seem to be concerned.

				Well, I&#039;ve been hitting up vendors all night and the only one I can find available and willing to do it, wants a deposit into his bank account.&nbsp; It&#039;s becoming frustrating.&nbsp; I had a deal worked out with Sugar Mama, but I think Sugar Mama is on vacation.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably be using BTCKing tomorrow by making a deposit at a bank.&nbsp; He seems pretty legit.

				Use Get-Bitcoin.com they allow for cash deposits at BofA or chase and typically you&#039;ll have the funds in 12 hours max.

				All the bitcoin vendors ads for MPs are up. Plus I never heard of any1 having problems using MP ....... MP is like the only practical way 2 buy bitcoins. If we wernt able 2 use that we would have 2 use ways that could identify us

				Are you in the US? If so go to bitinstant.com set up a cash deposit through TrustCash into Mt. Gox, TradeHill or any of 3 more exchanges (4.49-4.99% fee), pick your closest bank, go in and make an anonymous cash deposit which shows up in the BC exchange you picked VERY quickly, buy your bc, transfer to your SR address. Takes about an hour total.

				Never used either, but with getbitcoin or bitinstant you&#039;re paying 5% more for your bitcoins and you can deposit cash in person at a bank. With a BTC vendor you&#039;re paying $5 for the moneypak card and then 10% to 25% more for your bitcoins (and therefore 10% to 25% more for your items).
