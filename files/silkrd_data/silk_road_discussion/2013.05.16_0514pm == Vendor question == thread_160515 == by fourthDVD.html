				A vendor that I recently purchased from is in stealth mode and also the word closed is where his info used to be.&nbsp; Is this account permanently closed or is it just a way for people to take a break?&nbsp; It makes me a little nervous because I bought some injection steroids and am now worried it could have been a scam.<br /><br />Here is the vendor link:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/54de93be26/90

His vending privileges have not been removed, so it is not likely he has been scamming. Is the order that you made still in escrow?<br /><br />Libertas

				No he always shipped super fast.&nbsp; But since these are injectable steroids (I haven&#039;t started using them yet), I am just a bit cautious.&nbsp; Plus, I had a question about his shipment and needed som info.&nbsp; There hasn&#039;t been anything to indicate he is scamming.&nbsp; The vendor has ALWAYS been polite and very fast in shipping.<br /><br />Still, fake steroids take time to discover.&nbsp; If you start a cycle on most products, it might be 3 or 4 weeks before you notice they are not real.&nbsp; Unless it is tainted...then that could be a quick and serious problem.<br /><br />The vendor was new...only 2 months.&nbsp; But his feedback and knowledge is tops.&nbsp; So when he left suddenly it raised a red flag.&nbsp; Hopefully he is just taking a break.

I can&#039;t really comment on that either way as I&#039;ve never used injectable steroids myself, but if you have doubt as to their authenticity then I would recommend not using them. Is it worth the damage that could be done if they are fake / tainted?<br /><br />There are a large number of reasons why someone might close up their store - it could literally be anything! Just please be careful!<br /><br />Libertas
