				Im in the same pot as I too have an order sitting in transit with him. I didnt see any suspicious activity going on either and he has delivered the past times I ordered off him. I messaged SR Support asking what happened and they said Sorry, we don&#039;t discuss a vendor&#039;s demotion with other users. Please read the SR Wiki to find out what to do if your orders do not arrive.<br />~SR Support<br />I think as customers we at least deserve to know if its a suspension or a permanent demotion.

				I dont think it would be working outside the escrow system because I saw another thread the other day about a vendor who was told to pay the fee&#039;s owed and then he would be okay. I wish the admins wouldnt keep us in the dark about this because it is completely our business to know what happened to him. I think it is strange as usually they jump on a chance to make an example of someone.

				Wow .... I had no idea this was why I was being directed to a screen to message him instead of being directed to his vendor page when I went to Thurgood Jenkins vendor page. He had 5 customers get love letters so I would have to suspect this had something to do with his Ban ?? temporary ?? and this is where I would have an issue. TJ was an awesome vendor ..... at least with my transactions he was ...... It would have been nice if DPR could have told us is why the ban took place and when or if he will return.&nbsp; Apparently another one bites the dust.

				Ok I messaged support they didn&#039;t tell me why, but they said if the pack comes the coins will go to him, also its not permanent they said its dependent on GFN actions on the situation.<br /><br />Would be nice if we could get details I understand the need for privacy and security but you can give more then that without putting anything at risk......................

				i agree man they could tell us a little bit to what is going on and what not and it sucks because it seems like vendors have a time period before they know they are going to get banned so they can try to suck out every last dime before they skip time if they are getting banned it should happen immediately to their account until they resolved the problem with SR ...a bunch of us are in similar situation with another vendor

				Ok so I received my order came in under a week :) Going to finalize tomorrow after I test it with the kit, I know its the stuff though and 9grams heavy on 100gram order! This guy is a stand up dude SR admins need to fuck off and tell us the reason for his demotion, anyway if he doesnt come back maybe he&#039;ll pop up on BMR, What is he doing wrong? seriously we shouldn&#039;t be in the dark about this type of issue <br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong I love the road and even though I fell for a scam once or twice I always thought the system in-place was stand up but now this is casting some dark on the sunnyday that I took SR for, I hope all is cleared up via transparency<br /><br />

				I also received my order. BRING BACK GFN. I WANT MOAR! Seriously, he is a fucking awesome vendor. I bet he is on vacation and doesnt even realize he got demoted yet. He took down listings before he was demoted so he probably sent them all and left. Also thought it was fucked up that they deleted his review thread. I have never seen them do that for a demoted vendor.
