				I&#039;ve been a vendor here for over a year, and I access the site multiple times a day.&nbsp; It seems to me that difficulties connecting are the normal state of affairs, not the exception.&nbsp; I would like to understand what, exactly, is the problem here.<br /><br />Most of the other threads I&#039;ve read about SR connectivity issues ignore the reasons for the issues , and rapidly turn into debate on whether DRP is a God or a Demon.&nbsp; Lets skip that, shall we?&nbsp; Let&#039;s just talk objectively about the issues.&nbsp; I suspect people would be much less likely to bitch and moan if they knew what the problems actually are.<br /><br />Let me start off with a few questions.&nbsp; I admit to being massive ignorance here; please educate me!&nbsp; <br /><br />1) Can&#039;t you just rent bigger/faster servers?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that what all websites do when traffic becomes unmanageable?&nbsp; SR makes a ton of money.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t this whole connectivity problem be solved by spending a little of it?&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe it could be as simple as this.&nbsp; Please tell me why I&#039;m wrong.<br /><br />2) Given that server capacity is such a chronic problem, why are images loaded by default?&nbsp; The welcome page alone contains a dozen pictures I don&#039;t need or ask to see.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t everything be streamlines and sped up if pictures were replaced by links, so that users only have to download the images they actually want to see?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll agree Silk Road isn&#039;t your regular website. They can&#039;t just hire somebody to host the website for them. It&#039;s not hard to think of what would happen. <br /><br />Money probably isn&#039;t the issue. It&#039;s about a running a website with a lot of visitors, without anybody knowing about it. I figure that ain&#039;t an easy job.
