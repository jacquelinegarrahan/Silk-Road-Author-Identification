				So a handful of my friends do OC&#039;s on a regular basis (they try to keep it to weekends but you know how it goes) but they always swore they would never do H. Personally, I find that I get more bang for my buck with H (if it&#039;s good #3. We all snort FYI) and from everything I have heard/read... If anything, Oxy (or any other analgesic) withdrawal is WORSE then Heroine withdrawal. Not only that, but mg for mg, H seems to be cheaper and go further. Any thoughts on this? I&#039;m expecting, as with most areas in life, varying opinions and viewpoints on this.<br /><br />P.S. other than the fact that you have to be careful with H as you&#039;re never sure how strong the product you&#039;re getting is, it doesn&#039;t appear to be more dangerous than PK&#039;s, at least as far as OD&#039;ing. What does everything think about that? <br /><br />Thanks for any opinions and/or insight. Happy belated Xmas/Hanukkah/Kwanza/Festivus everybody!<br /><br />Danker

				Yep, you&#039;re right I think. <br /><br />Oxy withdrawal is pretty bad and I assume it&#039;s because it&#039;s so short acting (it was always gone within 6 hours for me, right in to WD) where heroin and the morphine/6MAM it turns in to stick around a while and I&#039;m not even feeling sick for 12 hours or more.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t understand why but the duration of the drug affects how bad the withdrawal is and how long it lasts. Fentanyl withdrawal is supposed to be very bad and short as a result, and I would agree there that was real hell.<br /><br />H is cheaper too as long as it isn&#039;t cut badly and you can&#039;t really tell. A gram of good H lasts a lot longer than however much OC you can get for that price. Here on SR, $240 might get you a gram of pretty good H or about 8 roxi 30s. Those 30s would last me maybe 2-3 days, the H would last a week or more if it was potent like SupremeSmoke had last week. <br /><br />I would have had a hard time OD on oxy, carelessly shooting 40mg at a time over and over never caused me problems while doing the same with H would catch up to me pretty fast and knock me out.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even consider oxy anymore if I want opiates, the price makes it easy too. What a waste of money.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				H everytime, I generally smoke #3 H so don&#039;t need to worry about OD you would fall asleep first. near impossible to overdose from smoking unless you have other CNS depressants in your system.

				Roxy;s and OC&#039;S are not the same drug, u guys know that right? If i was to buy 2 80mg Oc&#039;s off here, the real ones or a gram of H, the Oc 80mg would probley last me longer and not cost as much.. Iv got well over a 10 year opiate tolerance and i just have never run across a Btach of H that i didnt wanna Blast all in a day.. IMHO

				A gram of H could never last me a week... I wish it would. I usually binge for 2-3 days and let the sick hit me (if any). A handful of loperamide HCL (20-40mg) will take off most of the sick for an entire day.

				Considering this discussion involves correlating the severity of withdrawal illness with the user&#039;s perception of the drug&#039;s duration/effect on the body, some clarification may be helpful.<br /><br />* Oxycodone is the generic name for the drug in question.<br />* Roxicodone is the brand name of the &quot;immediate release or IR&quot; formulation of oxycodone. (IR delivery is generally very crushable, snortable, shootable, abuseable). Since IR oxycodone is now available as a generic, the brand name Roxicodone is rarely dispensed in US pharmacies any longer (insurance companies don&#039;t like to pay for expensive brand name drugs after they have come available generically.)<br />* Oxycontin is the brand name of the &quot;continuous release&quot; formulation of oxycodone. (The &quot;contin&quot; in the name comes from this time-released formulation. You may have seen similar design in other drugs that use the suffix ER/XR-extended release, CR-controlled/continuous release, SR-sustained release, etc. ER delivery is generally more difficult to crush, snort, shoot, abuse.)<br /><br />There is no drug called &quot;Roxicontin&quot;, a common confusion of the drug names mentioned above.<br /><br />There is a large body of research that exists on the subject of opiate analgesic withdrawal illness. When talking about withdrawal severity, what does &quot;bad&quot; mean to you? Is it the duration of the withdrawal or the force/impact of the symptoms that defines &quot;bad&quot; for you as a user? This is often highly subjective and situational with lots of moving parts; what is bad for one user may be not-so-bad for another. Conversely, what&#039;s not-so-bad for one user might mean death to another. Time released products, by design, are meant to give the patient a steady stream of medication all day without having to re-dose. A fentanyl patch (brand name Duragesic) is the ultimate in this approach, giving the patient a full 72 hours of the drug with only a single application. Is fentanyl withdrawal worse than oxycodone IR withdrawal? I will leave that question for the veteran opiate users to answer, knowing full well that there may be some disagreement amongst users in the room. I don&#039;t recommend anyone running their own ad-hoc research on themselves just to find out firsthand.<br /><br />Be careful, friends.<br /><br />- eb 8)
