Doing so is similar to giving your cash to a random guy on the street and saying &quot;Hey, mind this for me for a while until I need it. Thanks.&quot;<br /><br />You should be keeping your Bitcoin encrypted on your own machine, and with at least 3 encrypted backups - one in the cloud, one on a USB stick / SD card, and one that you&#039;ve emailed yourself. Again, all strongly encrypted. It wouldn&#039;t hurt also to have a brain-wallet and / or paper wallet.<br /><br />This is currency at the end of the day. Who do you trust holding your fiat currency for you? Treat Bitcoin the same way - realise that it is only as secure as YOU make it.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Thank you for you input! <br /><br />We don&#039;t come to the forums much, but I am glad you added this. We started using www.instawallet.org because it was recommended by several reputable follow/fella vendors and so many users saying they liked it. We used it since the SR shutdown last year. We did dozens of transfers and withdraws with no hang ups at all! And when we transferred 3 days ago it was looking like usual. Hind sight is always so 20/20 - makes me sick! We have lost every single bitcoin we had for our vendor account.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hate bitcoins! Lol!

				Hi all, can anyone make me feel better. I have several instant wallets with 30 ish btc&#039;s in total, after reading the message stating they will sort it out if you supply the url&#039;s what do others think ? Am I going to get them back ?<br />Has this happened before and turned out ok ?<br /><br />Also can anyone advise on a good way of getting your btc from SR to an exchange without attracting attention. I was told not to go straight from SR to BTC exchange is that correct ?<br /><br />Thanks

				You cant get your coins out, cause they are gone.<br />They let their authentication urls being indexed by google.<br />That way everybody could access their wallet without password.<br />4.5kk $ are rumored to be gone.

				I have in the past used one time instawallets to briefly hold small sums, before I realised this did little to obfuscate anything. If I wanted to break the link between SR and my own wallet I would use a well established mixing service like bitcoinfog, only committing amounts I could afford to lose at one time.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot understand why anyone would be using instawallet as a store for bit coins,&nbsp; If I had a need to store bit coins I would familiarise myself with how to keep them on an offline machine, or as grahamegreen suggests a backed up and encrypted wallet. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Having said that I&#039;m sorry for everyone&#039;s losses.
