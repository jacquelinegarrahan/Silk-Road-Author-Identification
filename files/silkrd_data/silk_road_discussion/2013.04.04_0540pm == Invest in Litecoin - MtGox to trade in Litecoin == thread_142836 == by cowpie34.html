				Not like blockchain but there are some.&nbsp; Use can just use btc-e or VirCurEx though.&nbsp; <br />The litecoin software/miner has a wallet.&nbsp; I think that what this means - it was posted on litecoin org&nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp;Fresh from the Bitcoin codebase is wallet encryption, which allows you to secure the private keys in your wallet, so that you can view transactions and your account balance, but are required to enter your password before spending your litecoins. This serves as not only a protection to viruses and trojans, but also a sanity check before sending payments.<br />(warning all links are clearnet)<br />http://litecoin.org/<br />https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/List-of-Litecoin-related-services<br /><br />

				I do not know if this will actually start a jump in LTC value, but if it does I shall be ready. Already been mining for a few days, was thinking of getting into trading it. Easier to build up starting capital than with BTC since it is easier to mine.

				Would strongly recommend investing in LTCs, or at least start mining them, I just found a fairly new SR type site that accepts LTCs, it&#039;s called Atlantis, if you google &quot;atlantis litecoins&quot; you&#039;ll find it.<br /><br />It&#039;s without doubt that SR had a lot to do with making BTCs a relevant currency, if Atlantis brings LTCs into the blackmarket I can see a similar rise in their value,<br /><br />How many of us are kicking ourselves in the teeth for not investing in BTCs this time last year? Don&#039;t miss the boat on this one. And if it is true that MtGox are going to start trading LTCs then it&#039;s a dead cert.

				So what would you guys say would be a better investment at the moment? LTC or BTC? It appears both are raising, LTC probably being the &#039;safer&#039; option and better in the long run. <br />I think I&#039;m gunna invest quite a bit of money in LTC right now, but any recommendations or reasons why BTC would be a better option before I invest would be appreciated greatly. :)

				They WILL rise quite rapidly.&nbsp; Some mathematicians estimated that the average change that btc makes from $93 on April 1st to whatever it is at the end of the month will be demonstrated 5 times over with ltc.&nbsp; For instance, if btc rises 100% to $186 by the end of the month, ltc will rise 500% from (I believe) $2.35 on April 1st.<br /><br />I would like to point out that the opposite would then, by definition, be true.&nbsp; Since ltc is destined to rise VERY much in he near future it&#039;s easy to state that btc increase proportionately.&nbsp;

				If MtGox is going to be supporting them they&#039;ll grow exponentially and since they&#039;re so much faster to make transactions with they&#039;ll be preferable for most circumstances.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if SR started accepting them soon. :)

				There needs to be more outlets that accept LTC as a viable payment in order for it&#039;s value to actually &quot;sky-rocket&quot; as many people seem to be hoping it will.

				Im definitely on the pro-litecoin side of this debate.<br />Im very confident that between 6-12 months (to allow time for mt.gox to add them, they already have tickers etc written and issued a statement on twitter saying they would implement them) the value for LTC will grow massively; if even half as much as BTC then I will be very happy.<br />I see a few major steps towards this happening, step one being mt.gox adding support for LTC which will lead to other exchanges following suit.<br />And also, Silk Road finally adding LTC support- not entirely sure how this would be implemented, perhaps just have two &quot;wallets&quot; for accounts but one thing is for sure, if a site is using BTC, implementing LTC is a piece of cake. Imho Silk Road will eventually add LTC - don&#039;t know when but i&#039;m sure they will.<br />Another point is that with BTC at such a crazy high price, calculating prices of products becomes awkward, if BTC continues to rise and SR dont add LTC support we will need 2 decimal places, 3...<br />There are also now alot of Investors who are interested in crypto-currency now due to all the media coverage of BTC of late but most conventional investors will deem it too late to invest in BTC when they balance risk against potential returns.<br />Finally there is also the issue of miners which im surprised more people dont think of! There is loads of very expensive hardware out there designed specifically for mining BTC and with difficulty increasing over time profits will decline, for every miner a time will come where there rig is no longer profitable (many already are) and what do those guys do? Quit the coin mining game and just take the hit on the £10,000 they spent on hardware? Of course they dont, they mine alternative currency which pays out more- this is LTC.<br />Just my opinion but i&#039;m very confident in this, hence I am buying as much LTC as I can in exchange for my BTC as a longer term investment. Since I started buying my investment in monetary terms has already doubled. That is pretty sweet.<br />

				It crashed!&nbsp; Now why?!&nbsp; And what happens next?!&nbsp; I think the Litecoin will start to raise to something more in proportion of the Bitcoin as they both raise back up.&nbsp; People will want to diversify.&nbsp; A coin that is going up and down around $3-$5 feeeeels a lot safer than a coin going up and down from $150-$250.&nbsp; Being at $5 give the Litecoin a much safer appearance too because it&#039;s assumed that it needs to stay worth something, which may be incorrect, and it&#039;s a lot smaller fall for it to Zer0 then it is for Bitcoins.&nbsp; What I&#039;m trying to say is it&#039;s harder to imagine the Litecoin going back down to $0.50 then it is to imagine something bringing the Bitcoin down to $15 for a while!&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard too that the SR is not a significant factor in the Bitcoins worth anymore or it never was!&nbsp; If we didn&#039;t make the Bitcoin valuable then those same people may now see $$ in the Litecoin!!&nbsp; I know this is all just coming from me but I&#039;m trying to start conversation!!

I see BTC and LTC as a long time investment, you&#039;ll do your heart a favor by not watching charts all day and reading Troll Box on BTC-E. Steady hands will keep the value of coins gradually and continually moving up. <br /><br />Just be patient and hold. The sell high, buy low, move money here, there, back and forth to scalp a days wages is the same infection that affects the U.S. Stock Exchange - No one is actually producing or working to better anything and it&#039;s left our economy shallow. BTC can be better than that shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />translates to I bought high, and need to sell higher

				p.s. transparent that those cheerleading for LTC are low post count users, with no history, clearly here trying to drive up interest before they dump<br /><br />looks like a few people fell for it as well

				If it&#039;s really events like Cypress that bring the value of the Bitcoin up and not SR then it should continue to rise - rise again - because the global financial situation doesn&#039;t have itself figured out yet.&nbsp; This may be where the Litecoin and other crytpocurrenices really come in too.&nbsp; If there are stories of the people in Cyprus buying at $200 and then losing half of it then Litecoin and other coins will look more attractive.&nbsp; The people that are looking to protect their money aren&#039;t necessarily looking to double their money; they just want to protect it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think anyone would take the time to get on the SR forums just to pump up hipe about LTC.&nbsp; A lot of people on SR haven&#039;t outgrown their heliocentrism.&nbsp; Drug users usually think they are the center of the world, but I know there are a lot of people here beyond that.&nbsp; The people that really trade in cryptocurrencies don&#039;t think SR is responsible for their value.&nbsp; They would be calling up radio stations in countries like Cypress and putting the word out, which if they had done they might have saved a lot of people from having their money halved.
