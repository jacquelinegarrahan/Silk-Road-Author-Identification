				I look at a copied profile and i think scammer just because they haven&#039;t taken the time to write their own, some buyers won&#039;t know this and will probably fall for his high priced listings.

				I remember when Pharmville was still around, a new vendor came on the scene and copied their page out of admitted laziness. I won&#039;t name the seller because they ended up being a good reputable seller who has hooked me up with a good deal a time or two. I think they did it because they wanted to get up and selling fast and building a comprehensive vendor page seems like a daunting, time consuming task. PV didn&#039;t seem to mind and the seller in question quickly changed their page to an original one. I think PV had a good page and policies at the time and that&#039;s why they chose to copy it. They admitted it was out of laziness. Everything turned out to be all good in that case. In fact, the newer seller is still around occasionally as far as I know while poor Pharmville is still MIA (I think the heat got to them and they jumped ship, hope they didn&#039;t get busted.)<br /><br />oxyhoot

				I don&#039;t really mind if the vendor turns out to be reputable, i would take it as a semi complement. Just when i see a new vendor come on board with high priced listings and they can&#039;t be bothered to write their own page, it just makes me think scam and scams just piss me if general, i hope other people use the same logic.
