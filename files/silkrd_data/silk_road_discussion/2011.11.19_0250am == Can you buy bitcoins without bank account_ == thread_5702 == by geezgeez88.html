				Sure! Have you tried Get-Bitcoin.com? You can make cash deposits at local bank branches. Although Get-Bitcoin is dicontinuing Wells fargo I&#039;ve heard. You can still use Bank of America though.

				I&#039;m really up on CampBx. I&#039;ve made several Postings on it cause you dont have to provide much in the form of identification and you can mail in Money Orders or Check. Account can easily be set up on line, you send in your Check referencing you on-line account (User ID) on the check/MO and it takes about 3-5 days to be able to places Trades for BC&#039;s after you&#039;ve mailed your deposit. And as mentioned before, you can place Limit Orders, use Margin as well as Short Sell BC&#039;s.

				Not sure about get-bitcoin right now, as of Thursday of last week there has been no response to my emails after they received my cash deposit <br />and saying it was being processed. No bitcoins yet!&nbsp; Now they are not using Wells Fargo which is where I made my deposit.&nbsp; So be careful!

				the idea is to be as discrete as possible.<br />if 100 people stand in the queue to deposit cash into an account to eventually buy bitcoins, then it would look suspicious to whoever decides to look into the bank accounts or is flagged up in some way.<br /><br />i dont believe buying bitcoins is in itself illegal...etc..<br /><br />don&#039;t know where you lot are in the world, but try where possible to get your hands on prepaid credit cards and whatever doesn&#039;t have your name on it...<br /><br />

				Most prepaid cars have a routing # and acct # for DD purposes. On Dwolla you can use this info to setup a checking account. Thereafter they will send 2 small deposits to your account. Once you get those deposits you log into Dwolla Verify, then you can begin w/d. Some exchanges also let you walk $ into a bank. Paxum can w/d $ off your prepaid card, but they have high fees.<br /><br />Hope this Helps,<br />ColdFrost
