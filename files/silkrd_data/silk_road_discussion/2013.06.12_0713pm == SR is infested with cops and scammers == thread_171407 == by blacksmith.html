But, in all actuality, I would say 80% of what is said, by myself, AND others in these boards is made-up bullshit specifically laid down to throw potential LEO off.

				I joined SR ~ 2 months ago and was worried as hell when I started. I&#039;m pretty good with tech and I always do my research but some lessons require you to actually do to learn them.<br /><br />My worries were/ are:<br />- Will I get scammed, busted, the package seized, crap quality, addicted?<br /><br />My journey so far:<br />- Scamming is possible but you have to stick to the rule of NEVER FE. If the vendor requires it, choose another one. Only go with trusted vendors. 100+ sales and 97%+ feedback puts them in this category for me. Many Indian sellers have slightly lower rating such as 95% due to shipping problems but may still be okay if they package well (Many DONT though! If in doubt check reviews/ ask on their review thread). Quite a lot of vendors do ask for FE for new accounts (generally &lt;5 finalized orders, sometimes as high as 10 or as high as &gt;$500) but there are always alternatives. If you need to, build up your account reputation by buying small amounts (like a gram from most stuff) of other drugs from vendors who dont require FE. Don&#039;t attempt to build up your reputation by buying free or cheap ebooks, it looks dodgey as hell. Don&#039;t always go for the cheapest vendor because chances are you might get crap packaging/ crap products / scammed. If its a popular product then 95% of the time they don&#039;t necessarily have a cheaper source than all the others, they are either willing to make less or you&#039;re losing out in some way (packaging, quality etc). Always read their vendor and forum reviews first. If the Avengers is running a purity testing thread for that product (e.g. MDMA, LSD etc) then use one of those vendors. Generally they are well trusted and you can see lab results (although always be suspicious of tests of products purchased under &quot;agreement&quot; with the vendors (instead of anonymous purchases) since the seller could be shipping the testers the stuff they havent cut - ESPECIALLY important in the Cocaine testing thread in my opinion. I am suspicious of many of those vendors and their 60-85% pure cocaine under an agreement test. Unfortunately this is just the nature of the testers having limited funds, if you want things to change then please donate to them (Many of us love the Avengers so you could start there!).<br /><br />- If you&#039;re ordering commonly dog checked stuff (eg Cocaine etc) then message your vendor asking if they use MBB bags (check out all packaging types - I believe MBB is the best). Even if its not commonly dog checked (Like LSD) then it&#039;s still worth checking out packaging in case they just throw them in loose. Even with LSD, I require a minimum of being vacuum sealed (Not an effective packaging method btw! Smell leaks, even several layers). While 99% of the time you may be okay without, you dont want to be the exception. Pay slightly more for this. Stinky products: Weed mainly and also some speed paste, mephedrone etc are crucial. <br /><br />If you package smells of drugs it probably has far more chance of not getting through. Speculation but this IS a major problem with many drugs. People can smell some speed paste I got recently from many metres away. Thankfully they dont recognize the smell but if you&#039;re going to be storing your drugs over a period of time (not taking them immediately) you may want good packaging yourself and VERY SECRET!! stash areas. Wouldn&#039;t want any surpises for your friends etc. Sniffer dogs probably (i think?) can smell residue left from your fingers/ spillage etc so even if well packaged, be wary when handling. Be aware that most packaging will become less effective over time (there&#039;s a thread somewhere that states rough estimates of how long some drugs take to be found by a sniffer dog with various levels of vacuum sealing. Good evidence that it isnt a safe packaging technique. Lean on your vendors for MBB and only buy if they do it (message them back stating &quot;Sorry but I will not consider vendors who do not use MBB&#039;s. If you start using them please let me know as you will get my business&quot;). If enough people stop buying from those that dont use them, they will change.<br /><br />There is a thread listing some of the MBB vendors (search for it. TIP- searching in the top right box only searches the sub-forum. Click &quot;Search&quot; below the logo to search the whole forum or to specify). Ordering domestically is far safer than ordering internationally. Ordering from countries that are famous for drugs or seen as &quot;sketchy&quot;/&quot;developing&quot; countries will greatly increase your risk. Some examples are The Netherlands, India, African countries etc. It may be easier for those in the EU to get products from other EU countries than for the rest due to free trade however I am not sure (the more it blends in, the more likely it will succeed, so I GUESS Germany to UK is much safer than USA to UK). I have done ~ 25 orders in the last two months (spent quite a bit over $1000) with&nbsp; 50% of my orders being international (mostly EU to EU). While I have been fine I have decided that I have been a bit reckless and will be mainly aiming at domestic stuff from now on. I have generally found EU/ US suppliers to be the most reliable by far. Although I try not to order much from the US due to their incredibly strict drug policies (I have heard Australia is one of, if not THE strictest. If you&#039;re from a country hard on drugs, CHECK THE PAGACKING! Youll see this message repeated a lot here :P ) and &quot;world police&quot; status (Also if you get drug offences you will likely not be allowed to visit the USA along with many other countries).<br /><br />Do make sure to message domestic suppliers too as some of them just chuck the item in between some paper! (useless packaging if ANY checks are done, even worse if its loose inside and/or pills/ tablets etc can be felt through the packaging). If the vendor doesnt get back to you in a couple of days then do not use them. They either provide poor customer service and are worth skipping or are under too much demand (and therefore may be more likely to slip up or put less effort into your order). Even the best of vendors have had sketchy months (particularly due to demand) so be aware of that too. Dont use fake names, use the proper address. IMO an identifier is useful but cannot be done for 80% of accommodation. Like if You like in flat 31 on the 2nd floor and you use &quot;2nd floor flat 31 Street Name&quot; on all of your normal mail and packages then using 2F31 Street Name then you will know what something is and if a postman comes knocking asking for a signature, you pretty quickly know whether you should sign or not! (Refuse the package if you suspect. You will lose your money but it may keep you out of jail). Obviously if either of those address formats (or other alternatives) is not commonly used in your area/country then dont use it! The less it stands out the better and many people may actually recommend against this step (as it creates a kind of unique identifier). If you do get a controlled delivery, your address is dead remember!<br /><br />Also a good idea to think about how you get your bitcoins. The fewer traces the better. Bank transfers are the easiest for many but IMO regrettable as it leaves a trail and some banks dont like you sending money to known bitcoin vendors. There are vendors on here who offer money services and there is also localbitcoins. Purchasing small (personal) amounts is always the safest method as they are less likely to be targeted by police. <br /><br />How you conduct yourself in real life is also important. Be careful who you tell your drug stories to and how you do your drugs. I do not feel comfortable with how many people now know im a &quot;heavy&quot; drug user, gossip is dangerous. Not only that but more and more &quot;friends&quot; come over and start hanging out or trying to borrow your drugs. They might not mean it maliciously but you can start selling the odd gram of this or that to them just as a favour. Dangerous route to go down on, I&#039;ve sold a couple of grams of weed to a friend but slapped myself on the wrists after that. If I wanted to start drug dealing in real life, I would have to do a hell of a lot of research, setup and safety precautions (and since so many people know im a druggie now, its not very sensible!). You would be amazed at how easy the transition between having a good supplier (SR), giving drugs to your friends as a favour and receiving just enough to cover your costs and becoming a &quot;drug dealer&quot;. I also occasionally go outside on the streets while on drugs (With some you can pretend youre just drunk but you must be careful! Neighbour hood watch might report your ass if youre being stupid) which im not proud of. Dont do stupid shit with drugs on you, you dont want to end up with a pat down. Especially dont drive, this just makes you a dickhead and just as bad/worse depending on the drug as drunk drivers.<br /><br />- Check out Avengers reviews if they are reviewing that product. Check out the vendor SR reviews and their forum reviews. If there arent many reviews or something seems sketchy then avoid. Always remember saving money is not worth going to jail over (or getting hurt!). Quality in SR is usually a million times better than street quality and you will likely soon be looking down on many of those who buy their product on the street :P A slight exception to that rule is weed. I generally dont like transporting herbs over several days and think some local growers do great jobs (if you have the connections!). There is also quite a lot of rubbish coke on here too but generally better than street level (my streets anyway).<br /><br />- Maybe, depends a lot on you tbh. A couple of months ago I had hardly smoked weed before and done very few drugs. I&#039;ve burned through quite a lot of cash due to boredom and ended up doing a kind of &quot;Pokemon - Catch em all&quot; thing with drugs. Try a drug once and generally move on after to a new one (seems more exciting). So far I have developed worrying habits with: benzos, cocaine, speed (as of today! :/). Did start developing an addiction to ketamine (did it once a week for a month or so then three days straight) until I got some other stuff that I preferred (HATE the taste in the mouth and had a bad experience which put me off a little bit - TIP. Dont do lots extra if you think the purity is worse. Turned out I was wrong and got hit way too hard, way too fast). Going mainly for psychadelics is a good idea because not only are they not usually sniffed for but I find they usually tire you out at the end so you dont build an addiction.<br /><br />Lastly: Leave accurate and detailed reviews. Obviously dont say anything incriminating but dont give a vendor a 5/5 if your item never turned up. Explain at a minimum the delivery speed (and what country you are in), quality of communication (sometimes its smooth so none is needed), if you can weight it then say if its over, under or exactly the correct weight (factor in the bags too duh). Also dont talk explicit details about the vendors packaging as many have their private techniques and want to stay discreet but do say if you aren&#039;t happy or if they used MBB&#039;s (and if you&#039;re lucky another few layers), if you couldnt feel anything through the packaging and if the letter blended well enough (generally written addresses is not acceptable, printed addreses are far more common and blend in better). Talk about the product quality if you have tested it. If not then once you have tested it, edit your feedback (you can do this in your account - TIP: If you need to finalize but not leave feedback right at that moment [busy maybe?] then hit finalize and dont touch the rating buttons. Just exit the page and go to your &quot;account&quot; page to fill out the review again. I like to do this if I want a vendor to explain themselves for poor timing/ packaging before I write my reviews. Always message them before posting bad reviews). Also explain if the package smelled when you hadnt opened it (sign of poor packaging) or whether the product once opened smelled, explain the texture (crystals, powder etc) and colour may also be useful. Its also a good idea to leave a review under that vendors review thread on these forums. Sometimes it can be difficult to navigate vendor reviews and if they delete a listing, you wont want to have to search back through their review history to find other reviews of your product. <br /><br />RANDOM EDIT: Packaging refers to the materials used to keep the goods (hopefully) undetectable and the quality of the envelope (hopefully they use fairly thick ones). Stealth refers to how well the envelope blends in with regular mail. A normal envelope, a printed label, normal stamps, a return address and the feeling of paper/ card in your hands with no bumps/anything you can feel through the paper and a normal weight for the size of envelope are all factors in stealth. It can be confusing if misleading if someone gets these mixed up (as stealth may be great but they didnt use MBB&#039;s so packaging is poor).<br /><br />MOAR EDITS-SPEED RANT: Make sure your system is secure. Im personally not satisfied with just downloading the TOR bundle (although many say this is fine for people who just buy personal amounts, some will agree with me that security is paramount). I went for the simple solution of installing TAILS (linux distribution with TOR and other helpful tools like PGP built in) on a USB stick and now I boot from that whenever I need to access something ... illegal. Keep the memory stick updated and hidden (Very well! Dont want the cops planting software on it!) and dont let anyone see you on it (although there is a great mode which makes it look like windows XP). Dont access anything that may be comprimising (e.g. Facebook, email duh), dont browse on the non-tor (unsecure) browser (dont want any links to connect your traceable browsing and untraceable browsing). Dont talk about doing drugs, buying drugs or selling drugs over anything on the clearnet (normal internet - e.g. Facebook again) or even phone/texts (US, UK and EU members - been reading the news? :O ). Also be careful about browsing the normal internet even when using the TOR browser because traps can be laid. I believe if javascript is on they can get you or they can use PDF files to track you (still a security hole in TAILS I believe?) so generally dont download and only visit SR/ the SR forum. Make sure you use the right url (silkroadvb5piz3r.onion - I remember with silkroad-visual basic 5 (I used to program VB6 when I was younger)-pizza with the &quot;pizza&quot; in a funny accent. Works every time for me but im sure you have your own methods. Writing it down isnt advised and in your head is safest. The hidden wiki and many other sources have their links edited to phising sites so dont use those. If you have completely forgotten, use the links on the silkroad subreddit and learn the link ASAP). The PGP tool on Tails is quite difficult to use at first because there isnt very good documentation on it. Basically copy the vendors PGP key into the text editor, save it in a folder, click on the clipboard/paper looking icon at the bottom right of the screen and &quot;manage keys&quot;. Then do &quot;file&quot;, &quot;import&quot; and import the text file. To encrypt a message (like an address) write your message in the text editor, copy it (literally just ctrl-C it), click the clipboard/paper icon again and select &quot;Sign/Encrypt Clipboard with Public Keys&quot;. You will then have to select the vendors key, say yes to trusting it and the program has put the encrypted text in your clipboard (so you can paste it into a text file if you dont need it for another few mins or paste directly into SR). Remember to ask for MBB&#039;s above your PGP message too, always better to be clear. Unless you install a persistant volume with TAILS then you wont be able to save files. I would keep it this way since you shouldn&#039;t leave anything incriminating (and in some countries like the UK its illegal to not give up the passwords to encrypted files - I believe can be a 2 year jail sentence. I&#039;ve also heard that a ruling in the US means that US citizens should have the right not to give up the passwords but hey, i&#039;m not a lawyer). Obviously all of this security is totally inadequate for a vendor as you will have much more attention. Some members suggest not using your home Wifi and getting it out and about (I personally dont think its needed for a buyer but it could be sensible). They also suggest changing this wifi place every time. Obviously not somewhere with cameras and somewhere that you can sit in a corner so no one can see your screen or any dodgey shit going on (put on the windows XP style mode on TAILS). In a situation like this I would recommend starting up a new TOR window, browsing to a popular website in your country (Maybe WashingtonPost in the US and BBC in the UK) or something general, and open a semi interesting article. This means that if someone does try and look at your screen or you feel compromised, you can switch windows and it looks like you are reading a legit article (hopefully you wont be unlucky enough for them to see &quot;Cocaine - Silkroad&quot; or something as the title of the other window. For those that are wondering, I believe that SR has its own steps for tumbling money (basically flat out laundering - making it very difficult to trace). Those who are very security concious or make larger orders may want to look into a service called BitcoinFog (I&#039;ve not used it but it sounds good and pretty cheap). It also tumbles your coins but you will need to follow the instructions and leave them in for a certain amount of days depending on the amount youre transferring. Adding in a few steps with other wallets is a good idea providing youre not giving away any important info (like youve never accessed it on the clearnet). By the end the coins should be very, very tumbled so you should probably more be worrying about how you sourced your coins (bank transfer? Papertrail! Put a hat on to avoid cameras if you&#039;re buying money vouchers to exchange for bitcoins. Be wary of localbitcoin users in case they are cops/ going to report anything/ going to take your money and run. For some countries its far easier getting bitcoins than others. I am led to believe that the UK has one of the tougher systems since the large banks have come down very hard on bitcoin and bitcoin exchanges. Chances are if youre doing bank transfers of large amounts to BitStamp or anything else you use regularly, they will be watching and may start asking questions. Bitcoins are well known tools for money laundering and the banks will use this as their main excuse to attempt to destroy a currency that could potentially stop them charging all their little fees etc that keeps them going.<br /><br />The above step may take a few minutes. It is not for you. It is not particularly for the vendor (although good vendors may do better, bad vendors may shape up). It is for the betterment of the community. Its incredibly important that everyone on SR works together to keep the scammers out. We have to communicate well with each other and be willing to do our bit to keep the site up.<br /><br />Not entirely sure its all relevant to this forum post but I saw a guy who was frustrated and worrying and wanted to explain that we have all been there and most of us have learnt the system (and love the system!). Maybe some others will stumble across this and hopefully find it useful. Just do your research, find a trusted vendor and well reviewed product (e.g. Jesusofrave has good reviews, packaging and Avengers tests results for MDMA. Haizenberg is much newer, cheaper, doesnt provide as good packaging for LSD but also has good lab test results. Both of these I would consider ordering from, especially if I lived in their countries). If you dont understand, post on the forum or message the seller! ALWAYS use PGP.<br /><br />Good luck to all the other newbies and many thanks to the fantastic staff who keep this place running!<br /><br />Edit: Lots of edits. Too much speed.

I think it should be written on every page tbh, would sort out 90% of problems for the marketplace and the admins if people followed those two simple rules. It&#039;s easy to slip up though when you start (I did, once...) especially seeing as many of the great tips are scattered around in many different threads (even the SR subreddit has some solid info!).

				To be fir it is in DPRs welcome message<br /><br /><br /><br />Greetings and welcome to Silk Road!<br /><br />I&#039;d like to take a moment to share with you what Silk Road is and how you can make the most of your time here. Let&#039;s start with the name. The original Silk Road was an old world trade network that connected Asia, Africa and Europe. It played a huge role in connecting the economies and cultures of these continents and promoted peace and prosperity through trade agreements. It is my hope that this modern Silk Road can do the same thing, by providing a framework for trading partners to come together for mutual gain in a safe and secure way.<br /><br />You may be shocked to find listings here that are outlawed in your jurisdiction. That doesn&#039;t mean Silk Road is lawless. In fact, we have a very strict code of conduct that, if given a chance, most people I think would agree with. Our basic rules are to treat others as you would wish to be treated, mind your own business, and don&#039;t do anything to hurt or scam someone else. In the spirit of those rules, there are some things you will never see here, and if you do please report them. They include child pornography, stolen goods, assassinations and stolen personal information, just to name a few. We also hold our members to the highest standards of personal conduct and work tirelessly to prevent, root out and stop any scammers that may try to prey upon others.<br /><br />However, the best way to stay safe and make sure your experiences here are enjoyable is to educate yourself on how Silk Road works, and take advantage of all the tools and guidelines we have made for you. A link to a complete guide can be found on your account page, but here are a few tips to get you started:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Always use the escrow system! This can&#039;t be stressed enough. 99% of scams are from people who set up fake vendor accounts and ask buyers to pay them directly or release payment before their order arrives. This behavior should be reported immediately. If you do choose to do this, we will be completely unable to help you in the event of fraud.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Read the forum and the wiki. They contain a wealth of information and many in our forum community are eager to help a new member with a respectful attitude.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Start small. Do a few small trades until you are comfortable with the process before throwing all of your Bitcoins at a big purchase.<br /><br />The old saying, “with freedom comes responsibility,” couldn&#039;t be more true here. You will find easy access to things that could get you in trouble with your authorities and are downright terrible for your health. So, just because you can, doesn&#039;t mean you should. However, I&#039;m not your daddy and it&#039;s your job to judge what is good and bad for you. No one else can do that.<br /><br />Stay safe, have fun, and come say hi on the forums!<br /><br />Your faithful servant,<br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br />

				Nope I didn&#039;t even think of that since I was trusting the fact that SR would dispose of the addy in the shaded box, should I be worried???

				Thanks for the&nbsp; links.,&nbsp; I did do a lot of research before the buy, I did keep contant PGP communication w/ the vendor, I just didn&#039;t know that when you click on your order it asked you for an addy again, I didn&#039;t even think to put it in there as an encryption also, I&#039;m hoping <br />1.&nbsp; He disposes of the addy if he get&#039;s to see it on the order.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t get busted from here to then ;p&nbsp; massive positive karmatic vibrations to all vendors!!!!<br />3.&nbsp; He denies me for dropping the addy and gives me a second attempt to order properly.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was new at actually buying since I had never risked placing bitcoins in the SR &#039;till i was fully ready to buy something.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think everything will go well, I haven&#039; FE like everyone said even though he posted on his listing it is required, but since we had such good communication i think he&#039;s letting me do it by the SR rule of thumb.&nbsp; I hope the vendor has understood that I would really like to keep things rolling on the positive note since we all need to do our thing as safely as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Lovin&#039; the digital family ;p<br />&nbsp;:o ::) ;D 8)

				Gregory, I have no idea what you mean when you posted the comment below - <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; I just didn&#039;t know that when you click on your order it asked you for an addy again, I didn&#039;t even think to put it in there as an encryption also, I&#039;m hoping&nbsp; &nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It asked you for your address again?? This shouldn&#039;t happen!! An occasional and exceptionally rare occurrence of a vendor accidentally deleting/destroying your address would be the only reason this could happen.

				Well that&#039;s why you never should give out your info and you should always use PGP. It&#039;s a known fact that SR is being watched by cops.

				Really irks me reading some of this - Bill - it&#039;s a real pisser that vendors don&#039;t simply do business with integrity...the prices on here are steep so there&#039;s good profit margin and in my opinion no excuse at all to rip anyone off...that is just bad form.<br /><br />Personally, I try to build my reputation doing sensible business...reasonable pricing, the occasional insane sale (this week I&#039;m throwing in an extra 10% on every order for example) and really good customer care...and most important lots of real communication when needed...it really is simple. Everyone should be a winner...this site is so good...if used properly.<br /><br />Good luck all<br /><br />Doc
