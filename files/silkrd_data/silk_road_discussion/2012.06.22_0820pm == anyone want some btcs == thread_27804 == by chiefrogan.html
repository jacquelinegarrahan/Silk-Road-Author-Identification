				I will sell my body and my soul to anyone who gives me 0.45 BTC<br /><br />Apparently, that&#039;s all I need to pay for shipping of a free sample from this guy: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28525.0<br /><br />Had 4$. He said shipping cost me nearly 20$, then I spend that 4$ on lotteries and contest bullshits, and then.... he tells me that the 20$ price was for 1st class shipping, and that the slow shipping only cost me 0.45 BTC. How about that?<br /><br />So yeah, I will do all kinds of sexual favours for bitcoins. Please? <br />Will give it back too!
