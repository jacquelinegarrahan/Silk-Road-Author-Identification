				Hey all, I&#039;ve recently joined SR as a buyer because frankly I didn&#039;t believe such a thing could have existed. Much to my joy, it is a very real, lovely thing! I really want to get into the selling aspect but I can&#039;t find any general faq here. I&#039;ve read up on some stuff, how to package (triple seal, etc) and studied the packages from what I bought so I can get an idea of how to imitate their methods but was wondering if there was any guides to the other processes when starting a seller account. I really want to make sure I can offer my customers the highest service possible while avoiding as many newbie mistakes I can. Also, how do most of you deal with having no rating when you start? <br /><br />Any help would be appreciated, and thank you all again for making this magical place a reality!

				The search function here in the forums works pretty good and the silk road vender rules are pretty self explanatory.<br />Wade through the posts and read&nbsp; more before asking questions like this - it will keep the dog turds from being tossed in ur direction!!!

				Ah, ok. I will try the search function. I&#039;ve pretty much gotten used to internal forum searches (from the other sites I visit) being total crap so I didn&#039;t even try it. Thanks much!

				I have to agree with Christy, the search function is your best bet.&nbsp; Long before I sold my first item on SR I was a buyer, back in the early days.. then spent over a year learning, reading anything and everything I could find, improving my setup, and then noticing a lot of things.. what you realize I will leave for you to find out, you will need to determine if it is worth the risk/expense of becoming a vender, especially taking into account how the site is constantly (however especially now) changing and being flooded by new buyers seeing SR on the news who aren&#039;t at all familiar with how the site even works.&nbsp; <br /><br />It should eventually stabilize, and you will find your place in the market.&nbsp; By becoming aware of your competition, what you are up against, and then analyzing your profit margin relative to the risk you must expose yourself to, you can decide if being a vender is worth it for you.&nbsp; You need to have all aspects of your plan in place before you even register your seller account, and know what you will do when x and y happens, and have backup plans in case one fails (ex- you need to cash out coins anonymously- know how you will be doing so before you do it, and have several alternatives you already researched in case the first doesn&#039;t pan out.)&nbsp; Understand and plan ahead for all aspects of your operation. <br /><br />Also patience, and like I said, planning is everything.. which reminds me, although I was pissed at the time, looking back it is pretty funny- one time in my early days, I was doing a drop-off at a blue mail bin I infrequently used, late one night, drove 35 miles to it, deep in a quiet, upscale neighborhood, had been there the a few weeks before... I get there, box is gone.&nbsp; Unbolted.&nbsp; The USPS removed it, put a green storage bin in its place. I guess nobody was really using it.&nbsp; (Kinda was in the middle of no-where) Didn&#039;t relocate a blue one anywhere nearby either. (of course) Nice.&nbsp; So now I had to re-plan how I was going to get my orders out to my forwarder... luckily I knew of one other box 15 miles further on down the hwy.. point is, be patient, and be ready to deal with the unexpected.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;You will figure it out, good luck, be smart, creative, willing to learn and you will succeed.&nbsp; <br />Oh and don&#039;t forget to ask questions! if you don&#039;t understand something and cant find answers- that&#039;s what the forums are for&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Good luck, <br />Peace<br />Rx420

				Make sure this forum nickname isn&#039;t the same one you use on other forums. The same with your SR account name. Maybe sell legitimate legal items first to get the technical and logistical stuff out of the way in a no risk environment. Still use all the procedures you would if it were less reputable items though, for practice. ie wipe prints off of everything and use gloves. Seal the goods in a separate location from where you actually place the sealed container in the packaging etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m new and could be totally off the mark, anyone else feel like chiming in who has done the transition from newbie vendor to old salt?

				I would imagine he/she meant keep the Silk Road separate from everything else - username , passwords etc.

What is the reasoning for using a different SR forum and SR website account name? I would appreciate any suggestions you all may have.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Basically, you don&#039;t want to use usernames or passwords you have ever used/ currently use on the clearnet, on anonymous marketplaces such as this- you simply dont want to have anything that ties you back to your real identity.&nbsp; <br /><br />Remember, the least amount of identifiable information you expose the safer you are.&nbsp; Also, use encryption.&nbsp; This goes for all correspondence, even (especially!) when sending your address for an order- would you rather have your personal info being passed over the Tor network right in clear text, or rather have it be encrypted gibberish only you and one other person can read?&nbsp; <br /><br />Take as many steps as possible to protect your real life identity- if you still dont feel like you have every detail sorted out on how you will be invisible IRL as a vender, then you need to research more until you are confident you can operate 100% securely.&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace<br />Rx420
