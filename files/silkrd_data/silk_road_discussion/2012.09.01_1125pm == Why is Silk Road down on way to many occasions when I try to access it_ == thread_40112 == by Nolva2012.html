				I love the Silk Road but too many times when I try to access it it seems to be down.<br />Something needs to be done as its going to put people off.<br /><br />We need to hear an explanation from SR why this is.<br />It is frustrating me so bad.

				Many times this has more to do with the TOR network than it does with SR. I have watched the tor traffic via the logs on the client and seen a lot of stuff recently.<br /><br />The best way to check is to hit 6 different tor sites. If the only one that does not load is SR then it is an SR issue. If several of them fail to load then it is more than likely a TOR issue. You can also try hitting the &quot;Use a New Identity&quot; button. It will change the route your traffic takes and many times fixes the problem.

				Not sure why.. But thereÂ´s clues, If you turn up the log level on the TOR browser to include iforational events you see something like this:<br /><br />sep 04 21:51:38.542 [Notice] Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:80. Giving up. (waiting for circuit)<br />sep 04 21:51:38.544 [Notice] Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:80. Giving up.

Giving up on address &#039;[scrubbed].onion&#039;.<br /><br />It seems that the address is not being resolved.. So either a DDOS on the DNS servers TOR uses or something along those lines.. Its such a shame yuo cant just put an IP address in lol, But i guess that defeats the purpouse of TOR. <br /><br />ACE

				It has gotten to the point for me that I can&#039;t just hit the &quot;use new identity&quot; button. I used to always dp that if I had been idle more then 10 minutes. But for a couple weeks now I have gone as long as 4 hours and can not log in.<br /><br />Now I just shut down and restart Tor. It has worked every time until today where I tried for 4 hours to get online.<br /><br />I know it sucks but a small price to pay for this site.

				I can&#039;t speak for what happens all the time, but generally Tor network issues are caused by two groups of dumbasses<br />1) assholes who think it&#039;s a smart idea to try and download their torrents thru tor<br />2) other assholes trying to do shit like portscans and exploit scanning thru the tor network.<br /><br />Both of these activities slam the relays with a metric shit-ton of connections by their very nature. All those connections then get multiplied as they get passed from node to node and propagate across the network looking for a circuit. This is why you often have to try several identities to get a circuit that works.

				As has been said, Silk Road is *rarely* down when you try to access it.&nbsp; It may be temporarilyinaccessible, but as far as I know, the actual web server has only been down a couple of times in the past year and a half.<br /><br />To reiterate, the issue is a Tor issue, not a Silk Road issue.&nbsp; When you type an address into the browser, it sends a request through the Tor network to retreive the web page from the web server.&nbsp; If your browser doesn&#039;t receive a response from the web server within a reasonable amount of time, then you get the time out message.&nbsp; Now in the clearnet, when you type an address, your request essentially goes *directly* to the web server of the site, and so the &quot;timeout period&quot; is exclusively spent waiting for that web server to respond.&nbsp; In Tor, however, your request must be routed through the Tor circuit, which contains nodes, some fast, some slow.&nbsp; Since this routing is done randomly, it is easy to understand how a request for the Silk Road homepage might not encrypt, make it through the circuit, to the web server, and back to your browser within the timeout period.&nbsp; <br /><br />This has been mentioned above, but typically, getting a New Identity in Tor will help to resolve the timeouts.&nbsp; But getting a New Identity only gives you a new circuit path through the Tor network.&nbsp; The reason that this resolves the issue is that if your current identity is working through a &quot;slow&quot; circuit, then you are statistically more likely to get a faster circuit by getting a new identity.&nbsp; (Likewise, if you are on a fast circuit, a new identity will likely yield a slower one).&nbsp; <br /><br />My point is to be patient!&nbsp; Silk Road is a novel idea that is being executed on a scale never done before, so there are quirks to be worked out, or at least identified as the cost of being part of this community. If a new identity still doesn&#039;t let you connect, try another new identity.&nbsp; Try a few.&nbsp; If it still doesn&#039;t connect, wait 15 minutes, and try again with a few new identities.&nbsp; Use the link posted on the first page to verify that the site is up, but as long as it&#039;s up, you *will* be able to connect with the correct Tor identity.&nbsp; Just be patient, and be grateful that SR even exists.

				i think this has more to do with tor than SR, admin knows there is an issue and are working on a fix, i would expect DPR to post about this very soon, just hold on people it will get better, there are a number of threads running on this issue right now, there is light at the end of the tunnel and we will see it soon.

				For me it seems to be getting progressively worse. This week, both SR and these forums are so difficult, I am not here as much as I would like. I enjoy reading and contributing here, but I can&#039;t to the same extent anymore. All other uses of TOR remain perfectly fine. It&#039;s just SR + forum.<br /><br />My &#039;Use New Identity&#039; button is almost worn out ;) It mostly works after 3-4 attempts.....but not always.
