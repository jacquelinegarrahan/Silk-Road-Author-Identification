				<br />The current method I use to buy bitoins requires that I do so between standard business hours, monday-friday only.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know all methods Canadian&#039;s are using to acquire bitcoins at all times of the day, 7 days a week.

				alot of exchanges are available 24/7 the trick is being able to fund your purchase. To remain anonymous cash deposits at banks are the recommended way which are normally done M-S

				I use www.canadianbitcoins.com whereby I place an &quot;order&quot; for BitCoins and then go down to my local TD bank branch and deposit directly into their account. An hour later they&#039;ve transferred the BtC into my wallet.<br />The down side is that I actually have to go to the branch with money in hand during business hours (although TD does have the best hours, open until 8 on weeknights and even some Sat and Sundays too). The plus side is that it is all completely anonymous, unless you count bank branch security cameras that see me.

				hey man ! i use www.cavirtex.com. It is pretty easy , all you do is to go the a bank (RBC,TD,BMO(if you are in quebec)) on the work hours or week-end. You make a cash deposit and in a time range from 30mins to 12hours you should have your money in your account.

				I&#039;m also Canadian and new here and to the whole Bitcoin thing.<br /><br />I got a bitcoin.org wallet and it took a few days to download the blocks.<br /><br />I discovered that the Canadian Virtual Exchange www.cavirtex.com requires some paperwork and photo ID copies at the bank, so I didn&#039;t bother with them.&nbsp; Lazy me.<br /><br />With a simple phone call to my bank to set up a direct payment I was able to make 2 transfers from my online bank website into my wallet with www.canadianbitcoins.com and my regular email (check the SPAM folder) without even leaving home.&nbsp; It took a day for the bitcoins to be confirmed as transferred into my bitcoin wallet.<br /><br />Using my real name and a normal web browser, everything was legal up to this point.&nbsp; After this, prefer anonymity using Tor and a new alias to register on Silk Road, BlackMarket, their forums, TorMail, TorPM, etc.&nbsp; You can do business with bitcoins anonymously over the dark net but eventually you&#039;ll still need to give your trusted vendor a name and real address to be shipped to.<br /><br />I shopped around, decided what to get, and from my Silk Road shopping cart saw the bitcoin amount I needed to tranfer from my bitcoin wallet.<br />It took several hours to transfer from my bitcoin wallet to Silk Road to make my first purchase.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know of any other options in Canada.&nbsp; FYI, I have no affiliation with those sites.<br /><br />That&#039;s my .02 - hope it&#039;s helpful.<br /><br />~RutGroove<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I searched &quot;Canada&quot; for secure shipment through customs tips &amp; info to discover several<br />Canadian Bitcoin Setup threads (for someone to consolidate?):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » In Canada, need help on How-to deposit bitcoins to ewallet?:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36189.msg413702#msg413702<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » Difficulty buying Bitcoins in Canada:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=43002.msg467054#msg467054<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » Help in Canada????!!!:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47493.msg500896#msg500896<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Silk Road discussion » Method you use to acquire bitcoins, Canadians only please.:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47841.msg502838#msg502838<br />Also, I posted this info here:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BlackMarket Reloaded - Forums → Newbie Questions:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewforum.php?id=8<br /><br />FYI, here&#039;s an interesting post about shipping to Canada from a rogue Canadian Border Service Agent (CBSA):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11469.0<br />
