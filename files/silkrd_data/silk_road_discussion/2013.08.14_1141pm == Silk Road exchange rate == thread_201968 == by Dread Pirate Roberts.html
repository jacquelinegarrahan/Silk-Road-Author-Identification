				There have been some issues with the exchanges lately.&nbsp; Mt Gox&#039;s market share has dropped substantially, and its price has diverged from the other exchanges.&nbsp; Many buyers buy from exchangers who base off of the mtgox rate, while the sellers prefer the other rate.&nbsp; So, we have to compromise.&nbsp; Until further notice, we will use the current average of mtgox and bitstamp, the two largest exchanges and update every hour.&nbsp; I hope this is agreeable to everyone.

				Some people are going to prefer the MtGox price be factored in, and some aren&#039;t. That&#039;s just how it is. Yall know this though, I&#039;m not talking to a bunch of little kids.<br /><br />The main thing that I care about is consistency. I can work with any exchange rate as long as I know where the price is coming from... And in the past week or so I&#039;ve benefitted from the new exchange rates. I&#039;ve been using CoinBase to get BTC during all of this turmoil with BitInstant and shit getting hectic on the Tor network, and they sell for $5-10 cheaper on CB then they&#039;re valued on SR. So I get a few bucks extra per coin right now, kinda nice.<br /><br />DPR, keep it real homie. I respect you more than most people I know and I&#039;ve never even met you.

				It looks like mtgox does triple the USD volume of bitstamp.&nbsp; Add other currencies and it&#039;s more.&nbsp; http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/<br /><br />As much as mtgox sucks, they are the most liquid market in the bitcoin universe.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how it&#039;s possible, but there is a 12% difference between the spot prices of the two markets.<br /><br />I respect that we want to ignore mtgox, but if we want honest pricing then it&#039;s not a good idea to ignore the market where the greatest amount of coins trade.<br /><br />Is it possible to multiply the volume of each exchange in determining the weight it has on the SR price?&nbsp; something like:&nbsp; [(last price Market A)(volume Market A)/(Volume sum A and B)] + [(last price Market B)(volume Market B)/(Volume sum A and B)] = SR price<br /><br />

The effect is that it&#039;s created a shortage [Edit: surplus not shortage] of USD in the MtGox exchange. If one could easily move money and bitcoins between exchanges, one could make a nice profit from arbitrage until the arbitrage equalized the markets. Because the regulations are preventing the markets from behaving normally, the MtGox price is continuing to rise against the other exchanges. <br />It&#039;s not just a matter of time before prices return to normal. More likely, MtGox will lose a huge part of it&#039;s market share for good. Balance might be restored if US regulators clamped down on all exchanges simultaneously, or backed off of MtGox(which won&#039;t happen).

This was in mid-June. After two weeks they said they were processing USD withdrawals manually but working to catch up (stated on July 4th). On August 5th they released another statement which did not directly address the withdrawal issue, but rather explained there is now also a 10-day delay on deposits. Contrary to their statements I know of people who have been waiting a month since they initiated a wire transfer (withdrawal) and they still haven&#039;t seen their funds. <br /><br />You are correct in that you can withdraw other currencies to non-US bank accounts but those markets are separate from the USD/BTC market. For example the EUR/BTC gox volume is only a tenth of the USD/BTC volume. It is possible that some are able to withdraw their USD to a non-US bank but I am sure there are exchange fees added on by the banks. I suppose it is possible that traders utilizing this arbitrage are keeping the Gox USD volume afloat.<br /><br /><br />I suppose another way of putting it is &quot;who is buying BTC on Gox?&quot;<br />Whoever it is has decided that they are willing to pay $12 (&gt;10%!) more then they would pay at any of the other markets and if making a USD deposit they are also willing to wait 10+ days before they can trade their fiat USD for coins. The only people I can imagine buying BTC at this rate are the ones forced to because they are holding Gox IOUs and going back to BTC is the only way to access their money. Are that many regular bitcoin buyers really still going to Gox for their coin needs?

As long as there is demand for BTC, there will be some way to exchange it. Unfortunately though, there are still going to be fees associated whether your a buyer or seller. The overheads are only a compromise for the benefits of security and service provided to us.<br /><br />As with any type of currency exchange, there is no real way to stop fluctuations and variances in the price UNLESS SR decides to experiment with an internally FIXED SR rate. for eg. something simple like $100/BTC

				Ideally I would prefer the Bitstamp rate, but I understand this may not be exactly what the customers want. Thanks for considering carfully, but if I had to vote, I would say Bitstamp only.

				Gox is dead, I&#039;m irritated that their price is influencing SR&#039;s bitcoin price at all. The price on bitstamp now is 103.8 and mtgox is 118.8. all the other major exchanges are right around bitstamp&#039;s price, campbx is 103.5 now, btc-e is 100.2. BUT, SR&#039;s price is 111.8. Because of this, I am losing about 8% off the bat immediately from all of my sales because of Gox. Don&#039;t you think if Gox mattered anymore, people would be using them? With such a price difference, all you have to do would be to but coins on bitstamp, transfer them to Gox and sell them, then withdraw by bank wire, and you make about 7 or 8%. All you&#039;d need was enough liquidity and you would be rich, except Gox hasn&#039;t processed a fiat withdrawal in 2 months, their price for the bitcoin doesn&#039;t mean anything at all, it is artificially inflated, we all know this. So I&#039;m irriated that I&#039;m losing 8% on all my orders. Please Please Please DPR,&nbsp; DROP Mtgox from influencing the price of the bitcoin on SR at all, it&#039;s hurting the vendors.<br /><br />QM

This place is a free market. Yes that is capitalism. Vendor price collusion would be a distortion of our free market. You&#039;re whole rant has absolutely nothing to do with my point.

				DPR has stated that all profits made from this website are going to other agorist projects to free the world from tyranny. his stated that he only spends what he can claim in an audit so obviously the vast amounts of money going into this site are going towards a higher goal.

				If Vendor collusion means putting the price up 10% so that they can make an honest dollar and not an inflated dollar based on mtgox inflated price than so be it. We need to make a stand here if nobody is using gox to cash out (ive been waiting over 2 months for a substansial amount of money from gox) than why shouldnt we all collude to make things fairer for us and im sure theres some vendors who dont make massive profits on there stock so the inflated gox price is probably having a major impact on there bottom line.
