Support is run off there feet and if you had done any homework in the past people do get there coins it takes awhile to get it straightened out but there main priority is to keep the site up...Its not like they can call a temp agency and hire a part time workers when they fall behind.

				Here was the latest news in the sticky update page 1 post 1<br /><br />UPDATE (0225 UTC 11/16/2012): Withdrawals are up to date, so if you sent a withdrawal and it is taking much longer than usual to show up, please contact support so we can investigate.&nbsp; Still a few things to iron out with the site (people getting logged off, etc), but I think we are just about there.<br /><br />UPDATE (2326 UTC 11/15/2012): Might not have to take the site down after all.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you know here if we do.&nbsp; A side note about withdrawals:&nbsp; There have been a ton of them (understandable), so we are getting through them as fast as possible.&nbsp; Please be patient if we haven&#039;t gotten to yours yet.<br /><br />UPDATE (2254 UTC 11/15/2012): The site went down again and there are people claiming to be responsible for it and making threats.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to take any chances, so the site is going to come down for a bit while we investigate what is going on.&nbsp; Hopefully this is short lived... what drama!&nbsp; Next update will come before 0600 UTC.<br /><br />UPDATE (2355 UTC): Deposits are working.&nbsp; All outstanding deposits have been processed, and future deposits will be processed as usual.&nbsp; If you sent a deposit before or during the outage and your account has not been credited, message support so we can investigate your issue.&nbsp; Some withdrawals have been processed, but there is still a queue we are working through.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update when withdrawals are back to normal.

				patience is a virtue. just relax and give it some time. support is swamped from the downtime. the site didnt get as big as is because dpr goes around stealing peoples btc. why the fuck would he want to, he makes tons of money already, your few btc arent worth stealing for someone like dpr. ive read hundred of these missing btc threads over the last year, and not once has the situation not been resolved.
