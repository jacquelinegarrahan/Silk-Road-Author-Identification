				Hello,<br /><br />Today&#039;s decline in value for bitcoin (BTC) was caused by a very precise market play where a group of traders, suspected to be from Japan, caused a controlled decline from 266 to x&lt;220 within a time frame that intentionally caused many FOREX-based trading algos to initiate selling, which resulted in further panic from retail BTC&#039;ers (such as the majority of SilkRoaders), causing an even greater decline due to superficial fear, allowing those same Japanese traders from the beginning to re-initiate / add to their BTC positions at the extreme lows of today (today&#039;s low was 105). <br /><br />That&#039;s how it works.<br /><br />And for anyone who cares, I am very, very familiar with derivatives (futures and options) trading, in addition to FOREX trading. <br /><br />Please +1 Karma me if you appreciate this information as helpful. My only agenda with this post is to send love to this community by radiating the truth, and since I have some background in public equities trading, I figured I would shine some light on the darkness. Thanks!<br /><br />Infinite Love,<br />UANDiR1<br /><br />P.S. This is my first post as a non-newbie, my 51st post. I first posted this information a little while ago in the newbie section, and re-posting here since I am seeing a lot of folks are confused and still afraid, and most of you don&#039;t go to the newbie section.

				If there was such thing as a controlled decline we would all be doing it to buy it up cheap after the drop.&nbsp; If what your saying here had some reality to it, we would also be discussing the transactions in the blockchain that &quot;controlled&quot; the market.&nbsp; The simplest explanation is often the one that is the case.&nbsp; Apply that to the situation and its pretty obvious what happened. You can&#039;t have a market go parabolic forever.&nbsp; You can&#039;t invest in something and expect double digit % gains every single day for a extended period.&nbsp; I think people simply aren&#039;t used to a deflationary currency and once they get a taste they spend way too much time being bullish about speculation rather than counting their blessings and engaging the market with real transactions.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want to support bitcoin stop treating it like a free money machine and start treating it like a government free market machine.&nbsp;

				one can never be sure about this controlled decline....maybe it was santoshis cronies cashing on their seed bitcoins...<br /><br />but their is partial truth to this since someone big sold a bunch suddenly causing preset trades to catch in the flush<br /><br />IMO the price went up too fast so a correction was due and healthy......i forsee a steady rise back to 200$ level leading to 420 sales<br />

				The only thing I see of relevance here is grim for BTC. If the market is able to be controlled and manipulated to this extent by anyone then Bitcoin will never be adopted by the public at large. To us this is just a bump in the road. We predict another rise and it probably will happen. But to what extent? In order for BTC to truly be successful and reach those $1k+ per unit prices I&#039;ve seen fantasized about it has to reach the masses. Bitcoin was coming off the best 90 day news cycle of it&#039;s life. New start-ups and venture capital, a robust economy with more and more businesses accepting it. The fork and how quickly it was handled.&nbsp; Coverage was everywhere, and it was all good, now this. <br />If this in fact is the case I&#039;m afraid this is bad news for us, the Bitcoin Community. As with anything there are growing pains. But this will most definitely be considered strike two and at the least will have a marked impact on the success of Bitcoin.&nbsp; Like so many of us I&#039;ve lost thousands of dollars over the past couple days but still hold onto thousands of this currency.&nbsp; We may be a tight knit community but in terms of finances BTC is a drop in the pond.&nbsp; <br />This kind of behavior can not be tolerated. If it is then it&#039;s the same as any fiat currency, only easier to tamper with. As long as that&#039;s the case, wait the perception, then Bitcoin is destined to fail. As a community we may always be able to keep it afloat, but in order for it to reach it&#039;s full potential big changes need to be made to ensure this can never happen again.

If the system by nature can&#039;t be regulated, then we need a more diverse range of BTC exchanges and funding options. Competition, to some degree can&nbsp; provide stability.&nbsp; I am still optimistic about the long term BTC future. With so many articles about it this week,&nbsp; in so many mainstream news sources, its getting the sort of attention that could really launch it into the next level. (or kill it). But like I said. Optimistic.
