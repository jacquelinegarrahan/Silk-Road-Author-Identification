				Hey everyone,<br /><br />This is pretty much my first post, so hi&nbsp; :). Ever since I found this site its been a goldmine for my debauchery in university&nbsp; 8). I take every precaution possible and have made 7 successful purchases so far. <br /><br />However one has went very sour. I don&#039;t want to name any vendor just yet as the situation is rather confusing and I&#039;d like your input.<br /><br />I&#039;m from the UK and usually order from there since the UK vendors are great, there is no customs to go through so 100% success rate, but recently i decided &quot;fuck it&quot; and go purchase some nice weed from the &#039;olive oil&#039; country. <br /><br />This vendors English language skills were shit to say the least, but i could understand somethings he said and he was cool and we got on well. So fuck it, I bought the weed and FE due to his rules (he had good stats). He linked me a tracker in a different language that said a parcel was sent to GB (great britain) and that was it, the tracker just ends after that. A week later after the tracker it still hadn&#039;t arrived so I messaged him nicely, and he told me to wait, its been through customs etc, with loads of smiley faces (pretty strange), I thought &quot;fuck it, he&#039;s right. Im just paranoid, it will come.&quot; <br /><br />I give it another while then I message him back today. Thats where things turn sour. I ask a politely for a 50% refund which is promised on his page, then he starts calling me a scammer. He messages me my own details and says something along the lines of in google translate &quot;give me a 5/5 or ill post your details on the forum&quot; and thats where he showed my address and my name and country. This has scared me a lot...<br /><br />It made me realize something, it was easy of him to blackmail me like this. He seen an newbie purchaser (had 3 buys at the time), and a product no one had bought yet. He could of sent anything to GB with a dud address and a crappy tracker that I had to use Google translate to understand. Now im not even getting a refund and hes blackmailing me with my own details on the internet. Sigh this is depressing.<br /><br />Ive lost around 16-18 coins to this.<br />What should I do?<br />Just take it like ive been fucked?<br />Or maybe he did send it and hes the one suspicious of me? <br /><br />All I want is some fucking good green, my feet up and a game of thrones season 2 marathon.<br /><br />EDIT: Aren&#039;t addresses not automatically deleted or something after it is sent? Why has he kept mine?

				a vendor should never keep any addresses of clients after the package has been shipped. in my opinion if a vendor post anyone&#039;s address on the forums his account should be revoked.

				Send SR Admins details of the threat to post your details, they take an extremely dim view of vendors that break the rules and that is rule number 1.

				Thanks a lot for the support guys&nbsp; :). Yeah, I thought something was fishy when he threatened to post my address and name on the forums to stink me out or something. And yeah he is from Italy, I hate racism but I was mugged outside the Colosseum and now I feel mugged on here. Love to get a grip of that guy&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />How do I take this up with the mods?

				you can message the mods on the SR site but to be fair you should share this guys vendor name so other buyers can beware of him. requiring you to FE is an issue anyway but threatening to post your details is bang out of order.<br /><br />name and shame this prick.

				He&#039;s got a good rep. But his way of dealing with things is strange&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; <br /><br />His page:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2cd7b36b76<br /><br />There is his vendor page, scroll down a bit and read his broken language anti-scammer bit - &quot;THIS IS A NOTICE FOR THOSE SCAMMERS&quot;. He says he has 100% success rate with all tracking. He even said that on a new listing(my weed) nobody bought yet: &quot;100% success rate&quot;. Yet this tracker he provides only goes as far as saying its been shipped to a country and then it ENDS. All that does is apparently cover his OWN ass and leave the buyer with his dick in his hands because he cannot prove whether it came or not. Unlike other trackers I&#039;ve received in the past that went right up to my doorstep or local post office. On top of that I would have to SIGN for his bloody weed I bought, would there not be some way of him knowing I signed it or what? I do not understand.<br /><br />Also his refund policy:&quot;★★★★★★★★★★★★★profile updated for shipping traking 50% REFUND 16/05/2012★★★★★★★★★★★★&quot;<br />I ordered using the expensive shipping with tracking.<br /><br />His 100 rep is hard to disagree with, and its hard to doubt his sincerity, but I was a new buyer and now he threatens to expose my details? I&#039;m sticking to the UK and Germany after this.

I&#039;ve sent a message to him again telling him about this post, his blackmailing which is stated blatantly on his profile page towards &quot;scammers&quot;.

				Yeah you are both right,&nbsp; I should of taken screenshots of his profile. But his messages are enough to incriminate him alone before he changed his blackmailing on his profile page. He is now threatening me to stop posting on the forums or &quot;i destroy you with my hands and you can count on this.&quot;<br /><br />The predicament is, he believes I got the package, even though its a signed one on delivery. He accuses me of lying. He blackmailed me with my own details even though I have a good history to keep a 5/5 rating on his weed &quot;or else&quot;. Now he says hes got a receipt and he can show the forums but it includes my details so I better shut up?<br /><br />All I want is a 50% refund which was promised on his page using the postage i used (&quot;fast delivery traking&quot;) and ill be on my way back to buying quality weed off UKpharm and co.<br /><br />EDIT. typos

He accuses me of lying. He blackmailed me with my own details even though I have a good history to keep a 5/5 rating on his weed &quot;or else&quot;. Now he says hes got a receipt and he can show the forums but it includes my details so I better shut up?<br /><br />All I want is a 50% refund which was promised on his page using the postage i used (&quot;fast delivery traking&quot;) and ill be on my way back to buying quality weed off UKpharm and co.<br /><br />EDIT. typos<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />WTF...this guy is ridiculous. Don&#039;t even argue back to stuff like that mate, just literally say &quot;Fuck you&quot;. If you have proof that you can show to the SR staff then they wont allow that shit at all.

				Buddy, use UKpharm, or better still go for some genuine African bud at 90 or so an oz or 29 quid for 5 grams of kief. (swazibudbud888)<br /><br />UK pharm are not cheap but they always have quality.<br /><br />Look for other UK offers. Many grow so sell the crop and its a case of first come first served. Some are &#039;stealth&#039; so always fav any good vendor as if they go stealth only fans will see the listings.<br /><br />Not used bulldog as anyone stating you MUST leave 5/5 is not my kind of vendor.<br /><br />Also he or she sells BTC via paypal.<br /><br />You do not want to go there.

He just lashed out in a paragraph. He had a 50% refund policy with the shipping I used and I thought &quot;ah well, at least ill get some coins back&quot;, so when I asked him about the unreceived package - for the 2nd time I think - he lashed out at me with my details and threatening to post them on the forums.<br /><br />EDIT: What annoys me the most is that he claims constantly to have a 100% success rate with parcels yet I read some of his feedback saying they got a refund for parcels that never came. This guy is a liar, and hes only gone and changed his profile again.
