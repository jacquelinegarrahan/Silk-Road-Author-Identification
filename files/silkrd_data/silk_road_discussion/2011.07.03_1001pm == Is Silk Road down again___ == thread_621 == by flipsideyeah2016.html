				502 means Silk Road is up, just confused. When Silk is down you will get a 504.<br />502 generally happen at peak hours or when there is a flood. They are much less common then they used to be, but simply reloading again and again will get you in eventually.

				I too get a 504 error. Probably no big deal. Maybe it&#039;s due to the today&#039;s earthquake in New Zealand.

				@mrthc, i didn&#039;t mean to offend, I too have lots of BTC floating in escrow and in my account...it sucks :(.<br /><br />They&#039;re probably adding a new feature to the site.

				When this happens usually there is some kinda new feature added to the site, everyone relaxe, this generally happens about every 3 weeks to once a month....not a big deal, if it was a big deal something would have been posted up on the clearnet silkroadmarket page.

				But you would have thought that we would have been given a heads up. It wouldn&#039;t have been that hard to come here and say &quot;we will be down for x amount of time&quot; I would much more at ease if they would have done this. Just going down for hours with no word make me nervous.
