				I agree, it is a lot more confusing, even as a vendor. Now we don&#039;t have the &quot;View feedback&quot; section which we used to keep track of reviews. Now it&#039;s a whole lot more complicated and time consuming...<br /><br />I like the overall idea but I think it could use some work. At least bring the VITAL &quot;View feedback&quot; section of the &quot;Account&quot; tab.

				Please bring back the comments from customers. This is the whole idea of giving and receiving feedback. It gives buyers more confidence in the vendor they choose and lets the vendor know how their customers feel about the service they have been given.<br /><br />BRING BACK THE COMMENTS!!!!!

				If you read Dpr&#039;s thread he explains all the new measures, To be honest I think he meant well and all new things have to start somewhere, So he can still update and fix these types of things. I cant even begin to imagine the amount of work that goes into it. However in my opinion, It is a lot harder for some buyers to check you out, Everyone should read the forums about their vendor anyway, But scrolling over nice reviews with how good customer service was was a big plus for me<br />I loved going to my view feedback tab and checking out what had been left for me, Just this morning, I had somebody finalize and not be able to leave feedback, They could have left a review but didnt know how, so I sent them the link to explain it from the sr wiki. Here &gt;&gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Ratings_%26_Reviews&nbsp; but he was commending me in so many different ways I felt shit I could not get to see what he had to say about me. I loved going to the view feedback tab and think it is really handy and should be brought back.<br /><br />

				It appears as though you can still see reviews on the individual listing.&nbsp; You just can&#039;t see them on the Vendor&#039;s page on in the Account page.<br /><br />I would much prefer to be able to see them like before, listed on both the Vendor page and Account page.&nbsp; If someone gives me a poor review, I&#039;d like to know who it was.&nbsp; That way I can figure out why the review was bad, fix the problem, and make sure it doesn&#039;t happen again.&nbsp; If I get a poor review and I don&#039;t know who it is, how can I fix it?

				I would say there is benefits of the new feed back system.. But I too would definately like to see at least a few weeks of recent reviews sorted by date.&nbsp; Otherwise its much more difficult to pickup on trends.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would also like to see reviews related to individual products back, (or at least it seems to be gone for the time being).<br /><br />That said, it now becomes more difficult for bad vendors to create new accounts solely to discredit other vendors, as the feedback they leave would not weight heavily and thus not register in the top listed reviews.<br /><br />I think maybe we should give it sometime, and see how it works out... Maybe we can have best of both worlds?

				OK I don&#039;t think it&#039;s THAT bad, but like DPR just mentioned in another thread, no new information has been added BUT now &quot;not every transaction will be reviewed.&quot;&nbsp; What a shame.&nbsp; Every transaction should be reviewed.&nbsp; This was an update for the vendors IMO and buyers got the shaft.&nbsp; The ability to actually write out the feedback review is now more roundabout and therefore buyers are almost discouraged from writing a review.&nbsp; The very same reviews that the buyers count on when making an informed decision about who to do business with.&nbsp; Sure there will still be SOME reviews but the reason it was done this way was to make it seem like the vendor is doing less business than they actually are.&nbsp; The update was to protect vendors from LE and scammers.&nbsp; Because you see most buyers will leave 5/5 even if they don&#039;t feel 100% satisfied about a transaction because to leave less than a 5/5 risks being black listed or banned from buying from the vendor.&nbsp; So the ratings to me don&#039;t mean a thing.&nbsp; What does mean everything to me as a buyer is the feedback review.&nbsp; The actual write up where people are saying &quot;stealth is bullet proof no odor.&nbsp; Took 2 days to get to east coast&quot;.&nbsp; Would you rather have that information or just a 5/5 rating to go off of?&nbsp; The reason I believe people won&#039;t click &quot;review&quot; on the vendor page as much is because look at how many people clicked the &quot;discuss&quot; button in the past week and wrote something.&nbsp; I have some very popular vendors on my fan list and most of them were lucky if 5 or 6 people went to that page and wrote something up.&nbsp; It was a great idea in theory but the layout needs tweaked.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Like someone mentioned earlier in this thread, if you already have your &quot;go to&quot; vendors that you use stick with them.&nbsp; It&#039;ll only be harder in the future to make a good decision as a buyer as to which vendors are safest to use.&nbsp; I would encourage silk roaders to start using the forums more to write full reviews and feedback about certain vendors.&nbsp; I would encourage vendors to perhaps give an extra incentive like toss in a free item or say give 5% off the next order for those who take the time to actually write up a review.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And to DPR all I would ask is that you put that &quot;review&quot; section for writing feedback right back where it was next to the 1-5 rating scale on the same page so people don&#039;t have to hunt for it.&nbsp; You can still leave the option to not write a feedback but putting it right up in the buyers face like it was before will encourage reviews to be written.&nbsp; <br />

				I think it is nice to see buyer stats because that gives more information to the buyer for how trustworthy a review may be, but I really think there needs to be a lot more feedback showing.&nbsp; It used to be easy to go back through the last several dozen feedback entries, whereas now only a handful are on a page, and paging through them is very tedious.&nbsp; Also, not all of the old entries even seem to show up at all (I noticed, because I could no longer find some of my own feedback when scrolling back through vendor feedback past the date of my purchase).&nbsp; So, I think the new system would be a lot more workable if the additional info was condensed back into one line (most of the additional info is just a single number, like coins spent, and account age, and I think that could easily fit on a 1 line entry similiar to how it looked before).&nbsp; Or, maybe if not all the additional information fit on one line, the entry itself could also be a link to a full readout of that feedback entry.&nbsp; Or, the page could be like it is but just view a lot more entries per page, but that is a lot of scrolling with how many lines each feedback entry currently is.

				At least the reviews can be sorted by freshness, i didnt not realize this at first and would just see a few random posts on a vendors page, in this game its all about what have you done for me lately, and to me i like to scroll thru the past months history sometimes less to get an idea of what is going on with said vendor at the time.

Since when is this a situation of us vs them, vendors vs buyers. We are requesting a better review system so we can actually see the feedback you buyers leave us to make sure the quality of our service is maintained at all time, and that when something goes wrong, we pick up on the trend quickly and resolve the problem. We are &quot;moaning&quot; and &quot;bitching&quot; to keep you fuckin happy...<br /><br />Truth is, right now it is harder and more complicated for a vendor to see the real time reviews, how&#039;s that supposed to be good for both vendors and buyers?<br /><br />Some of these ideas are great and long-needed, but god the layout needs a lot of work. <br /><br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve noticed the &quot;View feedback&quot; page is back, however, it doesn&#039;t update anymore and all my recent feedback date from about a day or two. Had a couple of orders finalize today, some left reviews (because I can see it on the product page), but the &quot;view feedback&quot; page doesn&#039;t get updated. <br /><br />I know DPR and the staff meant well, but this is beyond broken right now, and we need to point out what&#039;s wrong when it&#039;s wrong, because this is what a community is supposed to do and hell SR is a big frickin&#039; community. We need more clarity and ease of access.
