				I, speaking for the whole community :D would really like to say THANK YOU for sticking around and keeping these forums afloat. As usual, you are all doing a fantastic job. I am proud to say I am a member of Silk Road, the community.<br /><br />We all realize that you are &quot;working&quot;&nbsp; here for free and for the good of the community.<br /><br /><br />I have seen them Ban a user that was trying to spread lies and possible personal information. They did this for &quot;US&quot;.<br /><br />As Silk Road is no more .......so in reality the Mods could just stop modding all together. But they have not. They have continued to work and keep things running smoothly. They are helping people with questions and overall encouragement.<br /><br />They have also been &quot;working&quot; on getting people over to the &quot;NEW&quot; Silk Road forums over at BMR.<br /><br /><br />At some point these forums are going to shut down because the bill will not be paid, No one knows&nbsp; when that will be, but it will happen.<br /><br /><br />I am really not sure who is left, but a big thank you for whoever is. Not just for everything you have done Since the 3rd but everything you guys have done for the last 2 years.<br /><br /><br />This has been one hell of a ride. I knew a day like this would come. I just didn&#039;t think it would happen because of a fake murder and asking for coding help and leaving your gmail and REAL NAME as a contact. Also I didn&#039;t think my captain would be renting a room for 1k, going to an internet Cafe to run this empire and hanging out in the Science fiction section of the Library using his laptop to run SR.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also a word of advice for anyone who is thinking of a new SR, if you happen to pull it off and you do 1 billion in Rev and 80 million in commission, don&#039;t watch Scarface, don&#039;t learn your computer&nbsp; skills from watching the Movie WAR GAMES, and if you happen to be visited by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security and the DEA because you ordered 10 fake ID&#039;s out of that Shitty- fucking -Worthless Country CANADA,&nbsp; ........ Don&#039;t just carry on like it is no big deal...... GET THE FUCK OUT OF TOWN!!!! And <br />close up shop!

				I agree. We trusted Dread to do what is best for the community, but he put his own selfish desires first, and is cost a lot of people money.

				I think I&#039;m the last - ssbd and inigo is gone, and libertas and have set up shop over at BMR.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to man the ship here until it goes under for good.&nbsp; I appreciate the support and have tried to be there for you along the way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take note of the new SR forum being hosted at BMR (http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewforum.php?id=29). Backopy has graciously promoted me moderator there so if Coachella or Infinite Source or whatever he wants to call himself pops up there you can guarantee he&#039;ll be banned there too!
