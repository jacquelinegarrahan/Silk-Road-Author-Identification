				Sunday night, and - most of the vendors are gone? Weed was about 8 pages yesterday; now there&#039;s one. Seems to be same most everywhere. I&#039;m new here, more inclined to toke and let it all roll by, but a good panic might be an option here.

				I think the filtering by geographic area kicked in. Honestly, I think its a good intention but ultimately a flawed system until all sellers are categorized accordingly. Of the sellers I&#039;ve dealt with, I can&#039;t get one of them to show up on a list, but if I browse their user profile, I can see their listings. I think this needed a better test run before going live.

				Deselect your home region then.. <br />Remember folks, if people can not change to the new standards then their sales will go down and then they will be shown the need to update. Then the feature becomes useful. Got to expect a bit of fallout each new update. But rather than complain be proactive. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I tried undeclared and it shows even less. I try to resolve shit myself without asking for help (I am stubborn) but I am at a loss here. Oh well I know some good vendors and I work with very few but it does suck to miss good opportunities

				Fair enough, any particular vendors you guys know are not showing up? I&#039;ll make a bug report and submit it to SR but I need to site some examples. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I don&#039;t think there is a bug. Here is what people (sellers, buyers) needs to do. For buyers, go to settings (top right hand corner) and select your Home Country i.e USA. Then check the listings again. Samething for sellers if you want your listings to show up, you need to change your Home Country and then change your listings to USA.<br /><br />This might complicate new buyers because they cannot see any USA based listings and will only see worldwide listings. I&#039;m hoping new buyers from the USA isn&#039;t set to default Worldwide listing. Otherwise, the new buyers from USA cannot see USA listings but will only see Worldwide shipping. They need to go into settings and change to USA as their home country in order to see USA listings.<br /><br />Nerd-Alert out!<br /><br />EDIT: New Register buyers can select their Home Country. Previous Buyers and Sellers need to update their Home Country in the Settings page. There is no Bug!

				That&#039;s because you&#039;re probably browsing through tor which, unless you specify otherwise, could likely lead SR to believe that you&#039;re anywhere else in the world.

				The problem seems that vendors have been allowed to enter free form text as ship to/from values and the geographic filtering keys off of a fixed set of values AND if a vendor has entered something not in that fixed set, their listing seems to be lost instead of just getting lumped unto undeclared. <br /><br />To be concrete, I tried both USA and undeclared and neither one will cause Cantfeelmyface&#039;s listings to show up but I can browse his profile and see that he has listings, but the ship values are things like &quot;US&quot; and &quot;Everywhere&quot;... which are still getting filtered out even when you select &#039;undeclared&#039; as your own region.<br />

				You asked for something to report as a bug... this was it... &#039;undeclared&#039; isn&#039;t a catch-all because of vendor entries that are not in the fixed set of locations.
