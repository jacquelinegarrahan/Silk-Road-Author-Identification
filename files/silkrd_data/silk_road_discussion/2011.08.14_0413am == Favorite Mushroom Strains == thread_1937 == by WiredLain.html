				I have been growing mushrooms for personal use for a good while, and I am currently on break for various reasons, and I am trying to decide which strain to go for next when I start growing again. I have been growing golden teachers up until I started my break, and those were pretty awesome. I am aiming to start back up this spring, but might be more like early summer. Just curious of anyone&#039;s favorite strains, and what recommendations you all may have for me to try this next time around.<br /><br />also, I currently get spores from earthstongue.com as they have a pretty wide selection, and I have had no bad experiences buying from them.<br /><br />Link if anyone wants to see what they have: http://www.earthstongue.com/site/388422/page/56762

They seem to be pretty small though, so it is a good thing this will be for personal use and not for profit lol. By chance have you tried the pink buffalo strain? That one caught my eye the other day but I had never heard of it before.

				Pan cyans are great but much harder to grow than p. cubensis. Of the standard cubensis strains that I have tried, penis envy is my favorite. Seems to be more potent than other strains. They don&#039;t produce spores very well tho so if you are trying to make prints or syringes from them you may have trouble.

				Nah this is just for personal use, at least for right now. No need to make spore prints yet lol. I have heard good things about penis envy, I will give it a look.

				Hawaiian Pan cyans in particular are definitely my fave species and strain. Consistently provide an amazing experience. You can grow them easily if you are capable of cubensis, they are just fussier, and also lower yielding. However they are MUCH more potent and fruit sooner than cubensis, and the dried mushrooms retain potency much better than dried cubensis as well. Also Pan cyan spore prints are easy to take and have a much longer shelf life than cubensis spore prints. Will be growing these for sale on Silk Road when I&#039;m done with uni.
