				They didn&#039;t kill it, just kept prying eyes from newspapers and websites out. I saw a couple articles that quoted users directly in certain threads. It makes sense to censor the subreddit for now. We have these forums as our medium at the moment. I pray to god they don&#039;t ban this wealth of information and the community here also.
