				Last Sunday I placed an order for 10x white thumb mdma pills from a reputable vendor as my first transaction on the SR. Domestic. Come Friday I still had not received it, so I sent a pm to him asking for the tracking information. Vendor checks tracking info, tells me the package had been delivered to a city that I have no idea where! He contacts SR Support to try and get the original PGP encrypted message that I had sent with my address but SR says they do not keep records of that. From his feedback and reviews I have to say it is very doubtful that he intentionally scammed me..<br /><br />Now, I know for a fact I did not enter the wrong address, as I have no idea of the city it was sent to.. But the vendor will not admit any wrong on their end, and without proof, it does not look good for me, since i have a brand new account with no feedback.<br /><br />One thing to note is that when I sent my encrypted message to them, they pmed me with a reply saying that they could not decrypt the message, and to provide my public PGP key. I know for a fact that I did not sign the message, so they would not have needed it. I provided it anyways and everything seemed set. I don&#039;t know what happened.<br /><br />Vendor says to take it to resolution, but I really just want to work it out. I know I entered the correct address. What should I do?<br /><br />I feel like they made a mistake and sent someone free drugs..

				the vendor wouldn&#039;t have needed your public key. if they couldn&#039;t unencrypt your address i don&#039;t see how that would help in any way. should go in your favour in resolution if that weirdness is on record. if the vendor refuses to budge you probably have no choice apart from resolution.
