So people will find such things if they want it. <br />I think its actually surprising how many people watch the ABC. Especially your sit at home stoners. <br /><br />Indirectly responsible? How so?

				All it will do is result in a load more aussies downloading TOR and signing up on SR and buying heaps more drugs. All I saw tonight was an advert for SR and a need for some people to visit the dentist more often, if they are trying to discourage people they really have no idea what they are doing.

				Also the report says the law has made many arrests in connection with SR but cant give any figures as there is too many &#039;agencies&#039; involved. Meaning they havn&#039;t made any arrests directly from SR. Even the bad teeth guy said he was busted&nbsp; on the streets because he didnt care about security and &quot;wanted to get busted&quot; . I hope he isn&#039;t the aussie ambassador for SR.

				This so called &quot;report&quot;, was as much of an embarrassment to real journalists everywhere as much as it was for any Australian related to or associated with that West clown or the customs guy without a fucking brain.<br /><br />This was fucking pathetic and makes me so ashamed (as if everything else about this place didn&#039;t already) to be a fucking Australian and I no longer consider myself an &quot;Australian&quot; but instead an Earth Citizen!<br /><br />Fuck you ABC you have fallen so far from your past reporting to this ridiculous ten minute advertisement of a goose with bad teeth, bad dress sense and an even worse haircut.<br /><br />Do yourselves a fucking favour and resign, and employ some people who are actually competent in their jobs.<br /><br />This was nothing more than fear mongering the middle aged to elderly citizens of Australia, who also happen to be the main voter demographic, into allowing these people who call themselves The State, to accept and allow laws to be passed through manipulation and fear so that these faceless bureaucratic idiots can come in and ruin our lives and families simply because they didn&#039;t agree with our way of life.<br /><br />Can somebody please tell me what the fuck we fought Nazi Germany for (and don&#039;t use that Zionist propaganda bullshit, I mean a real reason) and what the Cold War was about if we were only going to eventually act worse than both of these two nation states put together toward our own kinsmen? Forgive me, I&#039;m just a little confused.<br /><br />Absolutely pathetic and whoever approved this should reconsider a career in working with retards since they themselves aren&#039;t too far off it, and they can hang out with this West character as much as they like and swap stories about who&#039;s done the most stupidest thing in their lives to date.<br /><br />Can someone please knock this idiots crooked teeth out of his cunt head next time they see him, we would all very much appreciate this if you could, and take a photo and upload it while you&#039;re at it.<br /><br />Fucking n00bism!!!

				Ah great just what we need, more dumb aussies and their stupidity.<br /><br />I lived in Sydney for 3 years from 2005 to 2008 and australia is truly a backward country. I seriously don&#039;t know how the people put up with such an incompetent society, they are lazy dumb and boozy as hell. The woman are hot BUT half of them have balls as in they need to compete with the males OR they are crazy pyscho..i saw many time woman scattered on the side of the road spewing up or woman punching on..was lol though!<br /><br />And the media..sure it&#039;s not as bad as the UK but heck who runs the show in Aust? The govt or the media? Always making you feel worried about this and that. <br /><br />In the end i had to leave cuase of work..but geez never again. Lovely geography (sydney) but gee stupid people.

				Really? I just read the transcript and seems pretty straightforward to me. Didn&#039;t appear to say anything incorrect or sensationalize anything. Even the dealer admitted it was his own fault for being busted. Didn&#039;t seem to have an agenda to me, just reporting on the situation. What&#039;s everyone&#039;s gripe with it? Just that other people know? Or not pro-drugs enough for you?<br /><br />Your DrugBuddy.

				Jesus guys, what were you expecting? A whole 60 minutes program and a full investigation?<br />SR in oz has gone from radio to 7pm project to 7:30 report in a few months. Everyone that needs to know about it is already on here. The reporter was trying to show how retarded customs are - listen to that retard talk, they&#039;ve never caught anyone and they never will! Be happy you had that busted tooth guy on the program because his honesty and idiocy are what we needed the Oz public to see.<br /><br />Yes I was the vendor in the dark, and I will never release my vendor details for the safety of my customers, but think what that report would have been like without a dealer, customs, a PC tech dude, and a nerd who got busted.<br /><br />Welcome the new users because every day we get closer to removing prohibition.

West was courageous to be interviewed on camera. I&#039;d be interested to know how they found him. Anyone in the Aussie thread/s remember reports of a seizure notice in WA?

				I wanted to say something but already is summed up pretty much exactly as I would have said it:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91552.msg644540#msg644540">Quote from: WhyHen2 on December 05, 2012, 11:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ryan West, what a drop kick, I hope he reads this and realizes how much of a loser he is.<br /><br />Unfortunate to see such a retard representing Silk Road.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The fact this thread was kre-8 only 2 days ago but already runs 3 pages long is proof people feel the same.... T-O-T-A-L D-U-M-B-A-S-S. I&#039;m glad he got caught. Hope he knows how to keep his mouth shut, or he might have more serious problems than merely being in prison to worry about. (If he&#039;s stupid enough to deliberately be caught he&#039;s probably the type of person to give over his username and customer details to simply boast or get off. He SAID he wouldn&#039;t, but he sounds like a little bitch-dog who would crumble if a cop even looked at him the wrong way.)<br /><br />I agree with so-and-so, SR doesn&#039;t need this kind of exposure after the The Project&#039;s coverage. Last thing we need is Julia Gillard, who is a dope, to legislate new measures for auto-scanning letters or what-not. If there&#039;s any further SR exposes in the media it may stir up a bees&#039; nest the same way the Port Arthur massacre forced new legislation. We don&#039;t need it. If there is a vendor who wants to boast to people not in the know about being a big shot on SR, go away please. You&#039;ll ruin it for the rest of us.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91552.msg644540#msg644540">Quote from: collarbones on December 05, 2012, 11:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I watched the story as a SR user and was pleasantly surprised to find how sensible and non-sensationalised the report was</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes but it mentioned how easy it was to put it in the post about 3 times, like it was suggesting tightening this area. It&#039;s a technique used to persuade an audience without appearing to be sensationalist. (I&#039;m not referring to my textbook to find out exact name; it&#039;s there somewhere.)<br /><br />I disagree with so-and-so (different so-and-so above), SR is not 100% invulnerable and Tor isn&#039;t 100% impenetrable. Watch the video on YouTube, 28c3: How governments have tried to block Tor (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX46Qv_b7F4). China is trying something creative, there have been other attempts as well. (Those pube-less losers Anonymous come to mind. If I ever meet these idiots, I will destroy their gameboys.) Tor&#039;s the best there is currently, but its under resourced. Terrain&#039;s always changing when it comes to its security.<br /><br />RE cop: &quot;you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re getting if you buy off there&quot;, um, aren&#039;t you guys the ones who raided someone&#039;s house at gunpoint this year because they were &quot;illegally selling black-market milk&quot; that had not been pasteurized? And you want to talk about ethical considerations regarding the quality of manufacture of drugs? Can you do me a favour and go home you poof?<br /><br />Yes me may get some issues with Silk Road Login for a few days RaFaeL5, should bounce back after that though, so don&#039;t worry too much. Probably pick up a few more members to tell you the truth. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91552.msg644540#msg644540">Quote from: PKD on December 05, 2012, 11:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah, a shitty bit of journalism, but at least it made me aware of this awesome place, which I immediately signed up to. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So it isn&#039;t all bad. Welcome to SR, PKD! Tell your parents and teachers to buy their drugs here!!<br /><br />Anyway, like RaFaeL5 said, the real danger is high bitcoin conversion rate. That will impede SR trading more than anything else BY FAR.<br /><br />All right I&#039;m going. I was slightly ticked off and now I&#039;ve had my 2 cents. Just a suggestion though.... if you get sick of vending, or being on SR, just quit. Don&#039;t go out of your way to get caught. That is just plain silly.<br /><br />Piece everybody. Thanks to whats-her-name for posting the thread. Drive safely.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote of the day&nbsp; &nbsp; My plan was to put nuclear bombs under all the cities and give all the other cities the control switches.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then everybody got real polite.

Hey Ryan, if your out there, not only you&#039;ve shown your face to a national news network, chatting shit about not giving a shit about your sloppy dealing, to the point of being arrested in your own home (I hope you&#039;ve changed your sending address since getting arrested, however with your level of retardation, anything&#039;s possible) to top it off your SilkRoad account details have been revealed to the world. Best advice I can give is to change your account details now.

				The first thing that I noticed about this report, was how they seemed to go out of their way to not advertise the other things available on Silk Road. <br />All of the story camera edits that showed the Silk Road website were always cut off at drugs. There was no mention of any other things on here (such as forgeries etc)<br /><br />There seemed to be a real intent to limit the discussion of Silk Road to drugs only, and while the report seemingly came across as fair reporting, the whole thing had Customs and law enforcement PR about it all. Especially considering not so long ago customs were releasing press releases to scare users. <br /><br />The seemingly unwillingness to discuss the full use of Silk Road for purposes other than drugs stood out to me, but then again, maybe that&#039;s all their focus wanted to be on given the vast majority of products on here are drugs. All the same, I would&#039;ve figured they would have mentioned how easy it is to access a lot of other illegal stuff on Silk Road as well. <br /><br />The whole thing screamed Law Enforcement PR to me. <br /><br />

				I had a big reply written up last night and then my connection cut off *RAGE*<br /><br />So a truncated version;<br /><br />It definitely reeks of PR from customs. They often claim to have made a number of arrests, but in reality these have been very few.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what was going through Ryan Wests head to be so open in that interview unless all charges that could have been laid against him have been... And for those of us that only ever be &lt; 10 grams, we can take some heart that if he isn&#039;t going to jail then we should be fine. Given the amounts of money he was talking about and being charged with intent to supply you can be pretty sure he was caught with a fair bit.<br /><br />I can understand why Bill would come on to try and give another point of view, but if I was in his shoes there is a serious potential bullet he was taking there. I always wonder just how secure someone&#039;s information is when they agree to those sort of interviews.<br /><br />Pretty much every computer expert has said the technology behind Tor, PGP and bitcoin is basically unbreakable by current technology. The most likely point of failure is through the post, or a person incriminating themselves by giving up too much information on the forums that can be narrowed down slowly but surely.<br /><br />Play safe, follow the wiki and the guidelines and you should be fine.<br /><br />And in the unlikely event you find yourself under police investigation, the golden rule - DON&#039;T SAY A FUCKING WORD. Don&#039;t do the cops job for them.

				Yeh. Seizures would obviously be up, prosecutions? If they had successfully prosectued ANY vendors, itd be front page news imho, used as intense propaganda to scare SR dealers off of the road. If they had prosecuted ANY real substantial amount of USERS, they wouldve flaunted it in this show. Theyve done neither, which makes me think this is a big propaganda piece. Think of the timing of it all....right before the xmas rush (we all know this is when people kain the orders). And to the bloke that got caught.....lets just list out the information we know from this piece:<br /><br />He spent 20, 000 US$ on MDMA in 6 months......Fuck me sideways, thats about 800 - 1000$ worth of bitcoins a week. That alone (along with a bloke with that kinda face and mouth) would raise suspicion to a bank on money laundering, which would garner an investigation into the guys accounts alone. Those are huge sums of money, coming form nowhere ( a simple warrant to look into the guys bank account and earnings (which would be 0) would warrant an investigation).<br /><br />This amount of MDMA would conservatively equate to around 13 grams PER WEEK, not only being ordered in, but being sold out the idiots front door. Lets say he was generous and sold 120mg hits. Were talking around 100 &quot;hits&quot; of MDMA per week. The amount of traffick going in and out of this guys house would have been a fucking joke.....<br /><br />Look at the big picture of this guy getting busted:<br /><br />Massive orders per week. <br />Massive bitcoin purchases per week. <br />No job, yet close to a grand per week to buy bitcoins.<br />Huge traffic in and out his house.<br /><br />This clown was ASKING for it. And theyre parading HIM around as a &quot;User of Silk Road&quot; that got busted???<br /><br />PLEASE. Give me a break. And on that note. If this guy is admitting all this, it means that the cops had proof of it all (the amounts of money, the amounts being sold etc etc), so if this guy, importing lets say, conservatively 10 grams a week, and selling it, gets put under &quot;strict surveilence&quot; and not sent to jail/made front page news about how police CAN catch people on SR. I think people ordering in the odd gran or two of whatever their poison, is gonna be fine even if busted.<br /><br /><br />END OF RANT.

				On the subject of idiots misprepresenting SR:<br /><br />http://foreverrising.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/what-is-bitcoin-and-what-is-bitcoin-mining/<br /><br />Reply<br /><br />I thought it was explained just fine. If you actually read the article (which I’m kind of guessing a lot of you just skimmed over it) you would realize that mining bitcoins isn’t something you just “do”, it takes work and the fact that only 21 million can ever exist, EVER, is what gives the bitcoin its value. As of August 2012, each bitcoin was worth approximately 10 USD. To answer the first question, the value to someone else is that they themselves don’t have to mine the bitcoin. They can offer a service or good, which one would accept, and then get paid in bitcoins (which as we know, is approximately 10 USD). For the most part, it’s really useful to people who trade in “shady” or “sketchy” things, such as users on the Silk Road (i.e. drugs and illegal weapons). However, you CAN trade bitcoins for actual money, so, all your hard work pays off in the end. Since, solo mining is so difficult however, your best bet is to join a “mining pool” and work with others towards solving the algorithm, or “block”, which is worth 50 bitcoins. Once the collective has solved the block, the block is divided amongst them. So, to simplify things, the bitcoin has value because it’s actually worth money and because it isn’t just handed to you on a silver platter. To add icing on the cake, you can BUY material goods or services with them. Really, if that doesn’t answer your questions, you need to be doing something else, like reading a book, walking the dog, or something physical, because that’s the most simplified answer you will ever get and you’ll never understand bitcoins. Also, for those of you wondering, “how do I get use my bitcoins on the Silk Road?” you need a special program (not sure what it is) and then you have to go through some long and ridiculous process to even find it, then more work to actually get in. It’s part of an unregulated part of the internet known as the Deep Web and it isn’t fun for anyone but the people that hack into your computers and clean out your bank account. Its also full of viruses and other crazy shit you don’t want anything to do with. IT ISN’T WORTH IT. Buy your drugs on the street corner and buy your weapons the legal way. If you get caught with an unregistered firearm, you’d better be ready to be fucked by the long dick of the law, and sending drugs through the mail is NEVER a good idea.<br /><br />Comment by church&#039;schiken — September 27, 2012 @ 12:11 am<br /><br />Somebody tell this fool we don&#039;t sell weapons any more on SR? Armoury closed a while back, and that twas a side thing anyway. Someone tell me why everyone out there who doesn&#039;t understand how Tor works thinks it&#039;s strictly for &quot;shady people&quot; hiring assassins or terrorist rendezvous? I&#039;m sick of it. Piece out bastards ;)&nbsp; <br />
