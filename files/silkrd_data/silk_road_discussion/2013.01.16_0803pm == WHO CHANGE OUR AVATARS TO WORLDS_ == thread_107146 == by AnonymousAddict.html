				One other thing SS. If you want to add an avatar, JPEG&#039;s and GIF&#039;s will both work, however, any animated GIF will need to be re-sized to a max of 53 x 53 pixels and any still image must be a max. of 65 x 65 pixels for it to upload and work. If you need help to re-size one, just let me know.&nbsp; :)
