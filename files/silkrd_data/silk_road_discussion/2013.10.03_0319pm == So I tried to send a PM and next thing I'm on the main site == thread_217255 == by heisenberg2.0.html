				it still does when under extreme load (it was doing it for me yesterday) when it&#039;s only under strain it does show that page now.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that it&#039;s something that DPR put in during that mad burst of development he&#039;s had during the last few months as I can&#039;t seen any way that the page can be loaded with malware as the fbi did with tormail.<br /><br />However, make sure scripts etc are off - just to make sure.&nbsp; There&#039;s no knowing who has access to the forums now since some are claiming that the dpr account somehow logged in after he&#039;d supposedly been arrested. (I haven&#039;t checked his forum page to see for myself so I&#039;m treating it as an allegation)

				No, it is the main site. It uses the forum URL though. From what i gather the forums are located on a different server from the live site but when that happens if you check the headers you get a location: change which is a 302 redirect.&nbsp; Guess where it goes? the main site. The main site is accessible, the Govt is running a URL rewrite to the home page in most cases which contains the seizure image, but not on a time out. But this does nothing for us. We can access the server with the right knowledge, but we need somebody with knowledge on the script itself. AKA. DPR. but that is not an option. But if the forums have a vuln, we can get to the main server as they are connected in some way, not just through 302 redirects.<br /><br />By connected i mean one server has privileges on the other for a certain level of access in certain services. This is not saying it can be hacked and you will get your money back! its just some info as alot of people are curious why this is happening. its irrelevant. <br /><br />

If the thing is set up properly then the login server should be separate (which I assume it will be since the fbi got the escrow server but doesn&#039;t seem to have got the main bitcoin wallets for each account).&nbsp; <br /><br />This is the moment we really need a script kiddy because if the servers are still running then with a login we could get in and get the bitcoins out.<br /><br />yes, I know enough about web design to be dangerously wrong but a girl can hope
