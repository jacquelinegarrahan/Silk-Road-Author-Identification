				So no deposits are getting thru right now?<br /><br />This is concerning as I deposited earlier today. <br /><br />Hopefully this can be resolved soon. I remember the last big deposit delay that took days, I lost a good bit of USD that time because bitcoin dropped in value while everybody was waiting.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I just checked again and most of my coins are in my account, I&#039;m sure the rest will be along shortly.<br /><br />Hope everyone else deposit show up soon.

				I had to go to bed and could not mail my deposit address to support until recently. 45 minutes has gone and it is unread. Can I expect to have to wait for it to be manned for me being in another time-zone? I really need help getting these lost coins back..&nbsp; Maybe its too early to ask that, but since I had a support message go unread for 6 hours yesterday, I thought Id ask. Granted, that one was titled Bitcoin Deposit Delay, so I can see why someone would not be in a hurry clicking that while they were already working on it and receiving more and more of those.

Perhaps you could spend of your own time and write up a programme of best practises. Get involved to make some positive change instead of complaining. <br /><br />Either add some greater value or adjust your expectations mate otherwise you&#039;ll be a very unsatisfied participant on the Road.

				All Support tickets relating to deposit issues have now been processed, replied to, and credited where necessary. To prevent similar issues in future, please always use a new address for each deposit; though it may occasionally take longer than we all want for an issue to be resolved, rest assured that if there are issues with deposits, you will always get your bitcoins.<br /><br />I would like to offer my sincerest apologies to those affected by the issue, and would also like to apologise for the delayed response times that many of you experienced. We do our best to ensure a response within 12 hours but when tickets back up about issues like this it does take a lot longer to get through them; that being said, we&#039;ll make every effort to keep the response time to a minimum during any possible future issues.<br /><br />It&#039;s a pleasure and an honour to serve each and every one of you within this incredible system that DPR provides - and which, without you guys, would cease to exist - and again, I apologise for the delays and hope that none of you have been too greatly inconvenienced as a result.<br /><br />Keep fighting the good fight!<br /><br />Libertas
