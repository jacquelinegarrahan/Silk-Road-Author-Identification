				No, because I delete the spam for 18 hours a day.&nbsp; The spam this morning means only that I had to go to sleep ... cleaning it up now.

				I also say no, it gives the spammers somewhere to spam instead of the good parts of the forum. If you&#039;re dedicated to spam to 50 posts then you are allowed to the real forums.

				I think its destroying the newbie section here for sure. People can just post normally in the newbie section to get to 50.<br />The moderators should definitely look into this.

				All it does is punish people who do not post frequently.<br /><br />My SR forums account is from 2011. I went from being able to post in my own threads, to being unable to for weeks! <br /><br /><br />Fuck <br />that<br />!

Anyone before feb/march 2012 can post like normal, everyone else goes to the newbie section til 50. Any sort of mitigation to help older members out here. I know i wasn&#039;t here then, but i can totally understand the frustration

				No. It still greatly reduces the amount of spam. I hardly ever notice it anymore.<br /><br />The newbie thread isn&#039;t doing too bad. Of course there are Spam threads there in the race to 50 but there&nbsp; are good threads too.<br /><br />There are only 2 mods here and the scamers are relentless.&nbsp;

				Truly understand mate that it was really frustrating for people who were here for a long time and who dint put in much post, they went from being able to post to unable but i believe it was done for a purpose and it is sufficing the purpose. Really the no. of spams have really reduced.

				I was so confused when I first realized that I couldn&#039;t post anywhere, nonetheless in my own threads! My SR account has been active for well over a year, but my forum account is only a few months old so I just thought of it as an initiation into the forums :)
