				Sheep Market (http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion) had 562 drugs yesterday. Now they have 922! If everybody switches over this can be the new silkroad. I believe they have escrow system like SR. If not there is another site called BMR. http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion<br /><br />It seems these 2 sites are going to be getting very heavy traffic in the next few days now that SR is down so you might not be be able to register on BMR for a few days. They aren&#039;t used to this amount of traffic

				Sheep Market appears more sketchy when it comes to site operations, staff, security etc.<br /><br />Browsing through the cannabis selection on BMR is almost depressing. Almost all of the vendors seem completely sketchy.<br /><br />This sucks. :(

				Awight boyson, nice to see a familiar face. I agree looking at the alternatives at the moment is pretty grim, that said, they have a good number of sr vendors joining them now, so I will brave an order tomorrow.

				Yeah, I have luckily found a few vendors I know I can trust. It doesn&#039;t in any way compare to my favorites list on SR though.<br /><br />I have seen a few people from the spare coin thread on the Sheep Market forums if you are looking for more familiar faces.

				Yeah Sheep Market&#039;s staff&#039;s writing is always grammatically off. Which makes me think that english isn&#039;t their first language and that they were out of the US. Which could be a good and a bad thing. Good thing because it would mean the DicksEverywhereAgency of America can&#039;t get to them so easily. But it&#039;s bad because it makes them easier to scam too. I think it would be wise while these forums are still up for people make orders and tell the old SR community if they went smoothly. Then we can all make our due transitions with more knowledge. I&#039;d make an order but I lost all my BTC with SR and can&#039;t get anymore right now.

				I really don&#039;t understand why vendors are moving to sheep when&nbsp; there is Blackmarket reloaded that have escrow , it is the second market place after our dear SR , it&#039;s up from long time ....&nbsp; &nbsp;sheep don&#039;t have escrow and miss a lot of features that bmr already have ... really don&#039;t understand ... maybe because the layout is a little bit similar then SR ? mah ...&nbsp; &nbsp;instead of this .. have good times

				I find both of them to be sketchy, messy and lacking in features. BMR does seem to have the upper hand when it comes to security and it does have a longer track record. Maybe I&#039;ll just move to Amsterdam ...

				For what it&#039;s worth, be it SM or BMR, I plan on ONLY dealing with vendors that have migrated from SR. Keeping my fingers crossed that my vendors from here move over there, but all of them have been awol on the forums so far. My guess is they are burning down their houses and moving at the moment.&nbsp; I really do hope they reappear though. <br /><br />Seeing that BMR has beem kind enough to give us SRers our own forum over there for discussion,&nbsp; hopefully this will help us all in migrating over. <br /><br />And btw, if anyone hears from xxxotica, fungifun, licenta, anonmart, norcaliking or any proven and trusted domestic medical providers, please let them know we are anxiously awaiting their announcement.
