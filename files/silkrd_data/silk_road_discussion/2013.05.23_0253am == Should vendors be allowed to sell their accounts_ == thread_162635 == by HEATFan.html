				I&#039;ve been thinking recently about a rule provision which allows a vendor to sell their account. I don&#039;t really see how the community benefits in any way by allowing this practice. I know that it is going to happen in some cases anyways but I feel like allowing it encourages and justifies the practice even further. <br /><br />There are already too many scams that happen on SilkRoad and allowing unscrupulous vendors to buy accounts basically allows them to buy trust and makes it easier for them to perpetrate things like FE scams or selective scams or scams in general. <br /><br />If a vendor bond is reimbursable I see no reason why someone would want to buy an existing vendor account unless they were looking to buy trust. Trust should be earned not bought.<br /><br />That&#039;s how I feel about the issue and I&#039;m curious to see how the community feels. Does this rule need some revision?

				Yes only if once the account is sold the account forever has some kind of signature or counter on it&#039;s page that shows how many times it&#039;s been sold. The buyer should have the right to be made aware of when a vendor account is being operated by different people. I don&#039;t know if something like this already happens or not, but if people can sell their vendor accounts it should.

				No.<br /><br />Why would you make it allowed for someone to run up the stats on a vendors page, earn customers, earn reviews (100) rating, then just make it open to any Tony76 to buy up the account, and pull a bunch of shit from the once trusted vendor.<br /><br />This would cause loads of trust problems among the community and loads of problems for the already busy staff...<br /><br />Just my .2 BTC..<br />

A legitimate vendor has no reason to purchase an existing vendor account unless it was for malicious purposes. If the vendor bond is reimbursable, how can one stand to gain by purchasing a preexisting vendor account? Only if they wanted to buy trust that was established by someone else. Only if they wanted to be allowed to request FE without putting in their due work and time to earn that privilege. There are no honest reasons to purchase another vendor&#039;s account is what I am saying.<br /><br />I hope DPR does comment because I am curious to know his reason behind this. I was going to PM him directly when SSBD suggested it but he also mentioned starting a poll and I figured I would gauge how the community felt before presenting my case.&nbsp;

				I agree with OP. This is policy could be better considered.<br /><br />If vendors are allowed to sell their accounts, it invalidates the entire feedback system. Vendors work hard for their 100 feedback score, and buyers trust that, so it doesnt seem fair on either party that some vendors are able to bypass this process completely.<br /><br />Of course theres no perfect way to deal with this, as its impossible to stop it happening. It would be better if vendors who have sold their accounts are obligated to make that public though, as I see someone else has also said. <br /><br />Not ragging on DPR&#039;s rules or anything - nobody is perfect, and all of these things should be trial and error. This place is thought out and run incredibly well; Way above initial expecations, for me at least. But this is one thing that I think would be worth rethinking...<br /><br />

				I&#039;m going to raise my hand and respectfully disagree with changing this rule, for one reason and one reason only!&nbsp; That reason being that it allows sellers to remain anonymous.&nbsp; I know that I don&#039;t want to be associated with anything that can come back to me, so I believe that being able to sell an account is a good idea.&nbsp; There are scammers everywhere, and an account is only has good as the people behind it.

				Yes, vendor accounts should be salable. If DPR changes his stance on this, he should allow vendors to sell back their accounts to SilkRoad. Since I was here from the very beginning I got my vendor account free of charge. Still, if you pay for something, you should be able to redeem that investment when you no longer need it, common sense and totally inline with the free market economics we have here on SR. I am guessing no-one that voted in this poll has had to fork out the cost for a vendor account ::) maybe their stance would be different if they had.

				I would like to start out by saying thanks to the Op as this is a great topic that should be discussed so thanks!<br /><br />There are pro&#039;s and con&#039;s to this discussion that have all ready been gone through so i wont go into detail but i think that the con&#039;s outweigh the pro&#039;s on this particular issue.<br /><br />As others have stated it does not look like DPR has a huge problem with this practice but i would also like them to implement something where it at least shows if the account is still with it&#039;s original owner(person who registered it) at least that way buyer&#039;s would know that the account was bought and could then decide them selves if they would want to put trust in the vendor and this would go a long way into protecting the buyer while still giving the vendor the option on selling his account.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and again great topic!

				It&#039;s like the &quot;cartels&quot;. How are you going to stop it?<br /><br />If a vendor sells their account and the new vendor has crap product and/or service, their reviews will tank.<br /><br />Even the same vendor can drastically change in the quality of their product or service, so there&#039;s no guarantee of anything.<br /><br />Either way, we have a review system, and the market will work itself out.<br />

				I agree that there doesn&#039;t seem to be much that anyone can do about it.<br /><br />However, if there was an interest in having rules about this, surely they would be that you can sell your account BUT: 1) the change of ownership must be noted on the vendor site for some minimum length of time, and 2) reputation/stats must be zeroed. There is really no justification for not requiring either of those things (excepting, again, difficulty of enforcement).<br /><br />As for LE buying new or buying used, a vendor with no stats attracts a few, cautious buyers. A vendor with longstanding dependable stats could sting a hell of a lot of users before people catch wind. Entirely different proposition.

Let&#039;s consider the possibilities when it comes to wanting to sell an account if it was not allowed to be done here.<br /><br />1. You could search for people who have put out wanted ads, but you would have to know where to look and you would be at the mercy of whatever they wanted to pay for the most part, since you are responding to their ad. <br /><br />2. You post your own ad somewhere you feel will be visited by someone who would be interested in purchasing a preexisting vendor account. In this second scenario you have to worry about your ad being seen by or reported to a SR staff member, resulting in some consequence for doing so. <br /><br />Basically, by officially disallowing the practice it becomes much harder for a person with ill-intent to acquire an account. If accounts were openly available for sale here and even advertised as such on the forums and elsewhere, it makes these accounts much more accessible to people who wish to scam.

				This is not a freedom issue or some sort of &quot;free market&quot; issue.&nbsp; This should be common sense, openly condoning the selling of existing seller accounts is EXTREMELY dangerous.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even know that was something DPR was ok with, I find that surprising.&nbsp; I am not worried about scammers as much as I am about LE.&nbsp; Yes, it is true LE could open a new vendor account to gain names and address but people don&#039;t generally buy bulk illegal drugs from a new vendor with no successful sales.&nbsp; LE is not going to send drugs through the mail to build up there feedback to get people to order bulk, and when a few orders from a new vendor don&#039;t come feedback would kill that account asap.&nbsp; Ponder for a moment if LE bought supertrips account, or some bulk heroin supplier.&nbsp; If buyers did not know that happened LE would get in orders for bulk drugs that would land someone in prison in the US for decades upon decades.&nbsp; This &quot;free market&quot; no rules fetish is silly to apply in this situation.&nbsp; In fact, that argument is intellectually lazy considering what could possibly happen to people in this community.&nbsp; Having drugs sent through he mail is inherently dangerous, but I think it safe to say that most if not all buyers think that the prospect of basically having drug convictions sold to law enforcement by a current trusted vendor is not part of the natural risk associated with this community.&nbsp; In fact, if this happened and people got popped over the ridiculous policy I think they would be within their right to assign blame on anyone who supported the open selling of vendor accounts with no notification of any kind to buyers.&nbsp;

				if a vendor account is sold, every existing customer should either, A: receive a notice.<br /><br />or B: it should be clearly visible on the vendor profile it was recently sold to another party.<br /><br />If vendor account is sold an people aren&#039;t aware of the change, it seems very dogy, an most likely will lead to scam / honey pot / harm to end buyer.. why the fuck is this allowed in the first place. :-\

				But the vendors usually have a public pgp key, so if he sells an account a new pgp key will most likely appear. Therefore I&#039;m a bit sceptical towards vendors who change their pgp key without signing the new key with the old one.

				Depends, I suppose, on whether it&#039;s possible to tell who on SR is supplying street dealers (I have no info that this is done, but I see it talked about, and it seems believable). Or bending caught buyers to go after other vendors, except, if everybody is doing what they&#039;re supposed to, buyers should know nothing of use against any of their vendors (one reason I&#039;m ok with the informational risk not being two-way - it makes buyers less of a target, too). But then I think there&#039;s&nbsp; probably some podunk LE force somewhere without the chops to mount any kind of real offensive on SR, with townsfolk screaming about Their Children! Their Children! and yeah, they just want to bust some people to be seen to be doing something, so maybe they&#039;ll buy a vendor account and just go and do that. Dunno.<br /><br />The more personal risk to me is that you could suddenly have a dependable, stealthy vendor become someone who doesn&#039;t give a fuck or doesn&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing. I ended up making a large order of mj because I thought to myself &quot;I&#039;ve got a dependable vendor with so-so stealth but great sealants, never screws up - I should make a big order and take 1 slightly larger risk than all these endless little risks that are eventually gonna get me caught just by chance.&quot; So I order and it&#039;s a MAJOR fuckup. The package stinks of weed. And of course, for once, it&#039;s major weight. Now, I don&#039;t think this vendor suddenly became someone else. They say they had problems on their end. I believe them (but won&#039;t deal with them again). However, vendor doppelgangers put everybody in that situation, all the time.

				I understand what you&#039;re saying and do agree on most of these points.&nbsp; However, based on the philosophy of this marketplace (and of DPR who created it) I think that the ability to sell vendor accounts will remain in effect until/unless something else occurs to change DPR&#039;s mind about it.

				Of course, maybe this issue steals the limelight from another: how easy or difficult it is to fake feedback (another ongoing topic). If it&#039;s relatively easy to do, then nobody needs to buy a vendor account; just invent some business first.<br /><br />EDIT to reply to scout: Well, can&#039;t even think of a workaround. There&#039;s no code or other identifying info that a vendor could have that couldn&#039;t be sold along with the account. But as for site philosophy, well, stats already eat into anonymity by providing a stable (however imaginary) identity on which to judge services provided. And I think we all agree they&#039;re a good thing.

Over time it becomes second nature to mini-review a vendor of their post count, karma, join date and what they say in the posts, but a lot of people don&#039;t. Fortunately most shill acc./s are really easy to spot. Sometimes though the best review is word of mouth from a proven forum member. The review thread is sometimes not what it can be, I tried to look into before some idiot trolled my thread, but some reviews are posted under duress and some are posted influenced by karma. Anything too commercial I just put in the bin, and if I have a question about a vendor&#039;s gear, it&#039;s sometimes better to just ask a regular buyer from them and they should tell you straight.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				An account is tangible, and it can be sold with or without the consent of SR. This is fact, just as much as it is technically possible for someone to make transactions outside of the escrow system by sending bitcoins (stupidly) to a user directly. It&#039;s also possible to retain addresses, names, and so on. There are a lot of things that &quot;can&quot; happen with or without systems, but just as the rules don&#039;t allow for the retainment of addresses, &quot;can&quot; should never mean an apathy towards saying no at all.<br /><br />The value of an account is immediately apparent no matter how you approach this: reputation drives demand. That is all there is to it. If someone wants to sell an account for a hefty premium, in order to make one last sale &amp; reap the rewards of having been an awesome seller, then they&#039;re going to do it because someone will buy.<br /><br />Rules don&#039;t need to be strict yes or no answers. While we continue to repeat that it&#039;ll happen no matter what, placing rules on it that state it comes with stricter responsibilities for the new owner (ie, a probationary period), gives one benefit regardless of what happens; If the new seller does not hold up to the reputation those who continue purchasing from, and it becomes apparent that this new vendor is not filling the shoes of the departed, then it is far easier to protect future victims from the continued exploitation of that accounts&#039; good name. Protecting the customer, is what gives value to a reputable seller in the first place. The feedback system won&#039;t solve that.<br /><br />Blindly allowing it to happen and turning the other cheek, only means that the probability/possibility of negative results increases. Perhaps a way to control it would be to allow a seller to change his/her password &amp; pin to one that on first login places a time-based permanent label on the sellers profile and any seller-identification that the shop is under new management, and when they&#039;ve adequately proven themselves to desire holding up the good name... it can be removed.
