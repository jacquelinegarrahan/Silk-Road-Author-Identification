				lol. Surely you didn&#039;t need to post this to see if he is legit... Just go by feedback, that is why it is there.<br /><br />Pro Tip - Search &#039;CanadianLTD&#039;. That might yield some better results.

				You need to do a little more research. There are quite a few threads on this vendor. Search the rumors section. I won&#039;t comment on whether he&#039;s legit or not, as I&#039;ve never ordered from him. I&#039;ll just leave it at that; see what you think when you read through the many threads on this vendor.

				His listings are fake with stock photos, his 5/5 feedback is fake as he creates it himself, his MDMA is fake it&#039;s been tested positive for methylone, the only real thing about CanadianLTD is he&#039;s a real scammer!

I think FrankMatthews is offering the cheapest 100g at the moment http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/39324820af and his review thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=40692.0 however there have been discrepancies with his latest mandy batch not being the same as the last, I&#039;ve never used him so cannot personally comment on this, I&#039;ve also heard positive comments about OldAmsterdam&#039;s 100g listing http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c9d6354a82 and review page http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38080.0 I have read some comments saying his shipping is very slow to some parts of this world, I have ordered coke and speed from him before which I received promptly but I am only across the channel from him. If you don&#039;t want it sent from NL Powerade seems to be the best for quality and value 100g listing http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1ff273b14d and review page http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66540.0 I&#039;ve heard good things about Mercury31 who is now shipping from belgium 100g listing http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b1b9a07163 and review page http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=41848.0 If you want a larger amount I&#039;m sure any of these vendors will be happy to discuss a custom order with you. The MDMA quality review thread is very useful for research http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1006.0 Hope this helps you and best of luck with your purchase :)

				I cannot comment on whether he is a scammer or not as I have never bought anything from him. That being said the impression I get is that he is scamming people, and I get that impression from what he writes himself, not what others write about him.
