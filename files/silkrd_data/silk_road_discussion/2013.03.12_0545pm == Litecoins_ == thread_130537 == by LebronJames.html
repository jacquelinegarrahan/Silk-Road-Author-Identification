For the other differences, I am not up to date with that, but Google can probably help you out.

				If LTCs become popular currency they will slightly devalue BTCs but at the same time stabilize them because the 2 currencies are immediately interchangable

				Litecoins goes from 7 cents to almost $6 to $1.50 to $3 in a little over a month.<br /><br />People are trying to pump up litecoins so they can cash out and profit hundreds of bitcoins to use on silkroad.

The &quot;difficulty&quot; of mining LTC is much lower. So the idea is that the computational backbone of the two currencies will be different, with the LTC propped up by a large base of PC&#039;s and gaming machines, and the BTC supported by a much smaller number of miners running heavy duty processing capability rigs.

				The TLDR version of the litecoin vs bitcoin differences:<br /><br />1) There will be 3-4x the amount of LTC as BTC (dont feel like looking up the actual number)<br />2) LTC uses an algorithm for the mining that makes thing like FGPA and ASIC mining not feasible--hence &quot;everyone&quot; will have access to LTC until it has all been mined.<br />3) LTC takes more confirmations, but is supposed to be faster getting those.&nbsp; <br /><br />People shy away of the Silver vs. Gold argument, but its pretty relevant.<br /><br />
