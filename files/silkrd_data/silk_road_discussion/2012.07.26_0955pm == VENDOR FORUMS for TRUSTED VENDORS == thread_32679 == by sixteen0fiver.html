				All You need to do have the password and the right key.

But I have found that 5 BTC&#039;s get&#039;s you the word... usually. Especially if you are real nice about it.<br /><br />Just be patient... they have a lot off applications they are going over along with all their other work.<br /><br />Just bump up the BTC&#039;s and write &quot;URGENT VF app&quot; in the heading.<br /><br /><br />In fact you might want to do that first...<br /><br /><br />Hope that helps&nbsp; ;D

				Someone mentioned in a similar thread that the vendor forum is only for vendors of illegal stuff. They had a vote on it which decided if their forum would only be for such members that ship illegal stuff. The vote passed, so I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s another forum for other vendors?<br /><br />This is just what I&#039;ve heard...

				No the first rule of Vendor club is not that you don&#039;t talk about Vendor club lol. In fact it&#039;s fairly inaccurate to think of it as a club at all.

				To sum them up in a couple lines: RC stands for research chemical. Methylone(M1), JWH, 2c-e etc are all well known RCs. Most of them are grey area when they first come out and eventually get explicitly banned. However even before they are banned there is an act called the analogue act which in certain cases makes even unscheduled chemicals prosecutable. <br />

				JWH and anything trying to alter a special bond like those of URB and all that, methylone, mdpv, mephedrone, every 2c even the ones not made yet where all explicitaly added to the schedule 1 drug act in the US about a month ago. Most things that aren&#039;t specifically mentioned qualify under the analogue act but as long as they aren&#039;t sold for human consumption they are not legal. That&#039;s why they were selling research chems as plant food and bath salts. It wasn&#039;t just slang it was to get around the analogue act.

				You are slightly off there Awakened. RC&#039;s are just the difference between when a drug is grey-area and illegal. Take Mephedrone and M1 for example, before they were banned - RC, after they are banned - Narcotic.

For the most part...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The best answer is NO. When the media refers to &quot;designer drugs&quot; they are usually referring to let&#039;s say &quot;bath salts&quot; and that&nbsp; term is just made up. Bath salts almost always contain a cathinone such as MDVP or Mephedrone. And though though those would be RC&#039;s they are not always what &quot;bath salts&quot; are. So in a way the answer is yes&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />Bottom line is we don&#039;t really give a fuck what the media says. On here they are RC&#039;s. Because in the real world they are RC&#039;s too. If you are on SR to get &quot;bath salts&quot; your a jackass. But if you are getting RC&#039;s...all good.<br /><br />(no offense to anyone getting bath salts..if that is what YOU want..do it!!)<br /><br />I hope that shitty answer does not confuse you more:)

				Nah nah nah nah. Designer-drugs are any synthetically produced drugs that don&#039;t occur naturally. So by that effect Cocaine, Smack, Opium, Morphine, Khat, Cathinone, Phenethylamine and Amphetamine although Amph is debatable aren&#039;t designer drugs because they occur in nature or are at most Semi-Synthetic. Anything else, that is derived from these are Designer-Drugs. MDMA is a designer drug and MDMA was an RC before it was criminalized and then became classed as a Narcotic. Designer Drugs are completely man made and are developed by organic chemists in labs. <br /><br />Bath Salts are just a silly brand name used to market RCs in an efficient way and make them easily accessible to kids. The RCs in bath salts then get banned and stop being RCs and become classed as Narcotics. <br /><br />It&#039;s all about what the government feels like classing a particular substance on whatever day of the week. <br /><br />Got it? :)

				No offense, but that secret vendor forum sounds both corrupt and suspicious. Isn&#039;t it just a place where you guy&#039;s warn each other about problem buyers? I hope to god you aren&#039;t trading with each other in there. Feel free to prove me wrong on the following points:<br /><br />Corrupt:<br />- have to get 5 competitors to let you in, suppose they don&#039;t want to because you sell the same product.<br />- can probably just bribe your way to vouchers if LE<br />- can set up 55 accounts and pretend to buy your illegal product if cops don&#039;t already have access<br />- everybody else before was allowed in without any vouch, so the forum is already compromised<br />- have to bribe all the mods as well. aren&#039;t they already given escrow percentages/money? not like they shouldn&#039;t make money, but I predict mods will be full ferengi by the end of the year, asking for money to reply to questions or do anything. <br />- no way to verify your buyers as a new vendor, thus increasing likelihood of being scammed out of escrow as this information is now for sale to select vendors only<br /><br />Suspicious:<br />- have to prove you&#039;re a trafficker to get in, sounds like intel gold for the DEA to get their hands on. <br />- you must have your SR main account linked in your sig, so you can give the DEA an easy list of players they can go watch and invetigate as the &#039;main players of SR&#039;. i don&#039;t see why you can&#039;t use anonymous nyms in it and then get access from the mods by proving who you are through pgp signature. <br /><br />- these kind of hierarchy boards were always infiltrated by LE in every online carding scene, and they had much stricter criteria for getting in. what makes you think this is a good idea

Isn&#039;t it just a place where you guy&#039;s warn each other about problem buyers? I hope to god you aren&#039;t trading with each other in there. Feel free to prove me wrong on the following points:<br /><br />Corrupt:<br />- have to get 5 competitors to let you in, suppose they don&#039;t want to because you sell the same product.<br />- can probably just bribe your way to vouchers if LE<br />- can set up 55 accounts and pretend to buy your illegal product if cops don&#039;t already have access<br />- everybody else before was allowed in without any vouch, so the forum is already compromised<br />- have to bribe all the mods as well. aren&#039;t they already given escrow percentages/money? not like they shouldn&#039;t make money, but I predict mods will be full ferengi by the end of the year, asking for money to reply to questions or do anything. <br />- no way to verify your buyers as a new vendor, thus increasing likelihood of being scammed out of escrow as this information is now for sale to select vendors only<br /><br />Suspicious:<br />- have to prove you&#039;re a trafficker to get in, sounds like intel gold for the DEA to get their hands on. <br />- you must have your SR main account linked in your sig, so you can give the DEA an easy list of players they can go watch and invetigate as the &#039;main players of SR&#039;. i don&#039;t see why you can&#039;t use anonymous nyms in it and then get access from the mods by proving who you are through pgp signature. <br /><br />- these kind of hierarchy boards were always infiltrated by LE in every online carding scene, and they had much stricter criteria for getting in. what makes you think this is a good idea<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Please tell us what the fuck you were on when you wrote this shit?<br /><br />I would attempt to answer it if I thought any of it actually made sense.<br /><br /><br />Also for the record there is not a bunch of us. There is one of us. We all work for DPR. We just use these screen names as codes for places we ship out of. Just trying to keep LE off us. There is not even a vendor only forum. It is made up to keep everyone on there toes. <br /><br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br /><br />

				Why is it so important to you to get in there ?<br /><br />Also, if it&#039;s 55 transactions why ask at 54, why would you think they&#039;d let it slide, you&#039;re nobody special just another vendor trying to get into an established club.<br /><br />Don&#039;t read this as an insult btw, I realize it sounds like I&#039;m being a cunt but just trying to explain it how it&#039;s probably seen by them.<br /><br />Just let it happen naturally, if you act desperate to get into a forum it sounds immature and a lil bit pathetic :(<br /><br />

				what is the added value of this forum, sharing customer blacklists? no that would be in such violation of the most sensitive information we deal with, peoples locations and homes. If i was a narc,that&#039;s wheree i would be. What&#039;s more dangerous is a busted vendor who agrees to work with LE to reduce his sentence and uses his network on Silkroad with the help of police ti infiltrate and ultimately try to damage it by showing that they have access to such a blacklist by starting to prosecute these peopke abd try to hope to establish that silkroad and tor are ultimately not safe enough. (their only chance imho of them winning this one)<br />Ah well, as long as you&#039;re happy i don&#039;t mind being out of th eloop...<br /><br />
