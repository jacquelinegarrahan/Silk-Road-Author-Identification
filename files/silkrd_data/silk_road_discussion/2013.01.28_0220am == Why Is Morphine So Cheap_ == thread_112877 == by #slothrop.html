				It&#039;s seems to me to be consistently listed at significantly less that the ~$1/mg rule that comparable drugs (i.e. hydrocodone) tend to follow. Having only tried it once, I can&#039;t think of any particular reason for this phenomenon. Thoughts?

				I wouldn&#039;t complain ;)<br /><br />I would guess supply is easier to come by, and competition pushes it down. Vendors will sell as low as the comfortably can / are willing to, as long as they have to compete, while maintaining a profit.

				For me i was really scared about the prscription opiod prices on SR. in my country central europe you can buy them in original blister aphotecary quality for half the price on the street.<br /><br />still the postage and the work packing has do increase the price a bit.

				*******************************************CANADIANDRUGS**********************************<br /><br />ILL GIVE YOU THE RUNDOWN ON MORPHINE AND WHY ITS PRICES ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN COMPARABLE DRUGS LIKE DILLIES,OXYCODONE IR ONLY,AND EVEN HEROIN , AND SEVERAL OTHERS. <br />morphine was and still is the gold standard that all doctors and pain control specialist use to gauge the amt of drug required for therapeutic dosing. there are charts out their telling you that this drug is 50 stronger than this drug, but it all comes down to the user and what they are looking for. morphine has been around for 100 years that does not mean that it is lesser of a drug for what you are trying to get oyt of it. <br />i have followed the drug opiate scene for 25+ years both in the medical field and as a pain control recipient myself for 20+ years. . <br />there are several reasons why morphine is drastically cheaper than any other comparable drugs i will list a few for you <br />1 it has been around for so long any company can produce it under its own brand thus lowering the prices considerably. <br />2 newer mess i say newer because anything under 100 yrs is newer . have a 7 yr wait till others can copy it. like oxycodone, prices skyrocketed till generic brands came along.<br />3 there are several types of morphine like all its competitors, a immediate release instant full dose no wait usually lasts 4-6 hrs. intermediate acting 6-12 hrs, a bit longer acting but pricier. and more dificult to beat the time relaease increase prices,.c long acting 12hrs take 2x day very difficult to beat formulation especially now&nbsp; &nbsp;a days. very pricy, d then the mother-load extended longer acting 24 hrs lke avanzia which is 24 hr acting morphine take it one a day ,impossible to beat the formulation ut the prices are out of this world.<br />4the you have supply and demand, most morphine i have seen in the lastv10 yrs is long acting, people thing like with oxyore morphine CONTIN they can beat the formulation and get 100% of the drug @ 0nce wrong. the only morphine sulfate immediate release formulation in high dose are the ones i sell they are 50 mg morphine sulfate immediate release tablets, and made in canada by a company called paladin, under the brand name statex, they make 5,10,25,and 50. NO 100 LIKE SOME SEEM TO BELIEVE. .i will talk about my product later back to the thread.<br />5buyers have heard by other users and now the media and government agency&#039;s that oxy is the strongest pill out their, that is flat out wrong, the largesrt pill now made and its a new tamper proof pill is an 80 mg op oxyneo,this pill gives its drug over a period of 12 hours no matter what you do to it or no matter what route of administration you choose to use. so in 20 min you are getting&nbsp; 0.037 mg in 20 min unlike a 50 mg ir morphine tab you get 0 mg in 20 min, lasting 3-6 hrs depending on your excretion rate. their is no comparison between ant oxt,contin or any long acting formulation.<br />6 prices are lower for&nbsp; morphine because of all the reasons i explained, its an older drug, but it has been proven to be the best one over tne last 100 yrs, and most sold are either long acting to compete with the new stuff or they are weak -10 mg breakthru meds to use inbetween long acting stuff.<br /><br />i have the strongest pill immediate release on the market. iot is a 50 mg morphine sulfate immediate release tablet. it compares to the ir oxycodone 30mg in strength but is stronger and by pricing 1/2 the price. <br />i know drug users are set in their ways and easily manipilated into believing they are getting a superior product and the exorberabt pice difference&nbsp; doesnt matter becausev&nbsp; they have been brainwashed into thinking that this great be all end all HILLBILLY heroin IS THE BEST THING GOING. WHEN THE BEST THING GOING IS 1/4 THE PRICES OF h AND MIN1?2 PRICE OF OXYCODONE 30, WHICH ARE A LITTLEL BIT WEAKER. <br />THIS DEBATE CAN AND WILL GO ON FOREVER, IM FOR ANT DOWNFALLS IF YOU THINK THERE ARE ANY, BUT EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER I SOLD TOO SO FAR HAS SAID EXCELLENT PRODUCT, EXCELLENT SERVICE AND WILL RETURN, MAY OF THEM X OXY AND H USERS THAT TELL YOU THAT MT NEW OLD DRUG JUST STRONGER CAN MORE THAN COMPETE WITH ANY Other&nbsp; DRUGS OUT THERE. and you will save a bundle not to mention it will last longer. <br />im seeing&nbsp; no reason to not give me a try. you will not be sorry. 8 SAYING GIVE ME A TRY ITS WAY CHEAPER ,WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOOSE THE AMT YOU SAVE BUYING MY STUFF WILL MORE THAN MAKEUP<br /><br />have a look at my sit if you are looking for larger orders any size please pm me we can deal thanks cd<br />&nbsp; link<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/992b673421<br />

				Wow that is a HELL of an answer MM. But there is a far easier explanation.....<br /><br />First the most common Morphine available is time released such as MS CONTIN. (morphine Sulfate) and it is SHIT. The high sucks.And FEW like it..though some do. I would love if a buyer would come in here and explain why? For certain pain it can be effective. It is Long lasting..18+ hours for 1 pill.<br /><br />And the other reason...and I believe the most important one...the same thing that makes other drugs such as Roxicodone $1+ per mg...Supply and demand!..There is plenty of supply...and little demand. Also on the retail level it is cheap. Less then $1 for 100mg.<br /><br />So the reason it is less money on here is demand is small.

				My theory is that pill poppers look at morphine as a hard drug like heroin compared to norcos, percs, and vics. So they would rather pay extra and convince themselves they are taking something not as addicting.

				I&#039;m no expert but I&#039;ve tried many opiates over the past 3 or so years. The only one I didn&#039;t like was morphine. It gave me the strangest feeling - a weird body high that didn&#039;t feel that great and made my head feel weird. Even IV&#039;d (from a morphine solution from a compounding pharmacy, so no weird by-products or effects to cause anything odd) it still sucked. Even crappy tylenol-filled hydrocodones are better than morphine to me.

The other point, while somewhat true, is also kind of not. Acetic anhydride is a schedule II precursor and therefore not for the faint of heart. There&#039;s also the fact that the vast majority of people are qualified to preform even simple chemical syntheses. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been done, just not by very many. <br />I like morphine, though, which seems to be the big factor here. I like hydro, oxy, and fentanyl better, of course, but I don&#039;t have anything against good old morphine. As for heroin, I&#039;m in no rush to take that plunge, so for now at least, I think cheap morphine is maybe the way to go. Besides, 18 pain-free hours sounds pretty fucking amazing to me right now. <br />One more question. I understand that morphine is pretty heavy on the side-effects. Is that something you people tend to agree with? I never had any issues with it, but I&#039;ve only tried it a few times.
