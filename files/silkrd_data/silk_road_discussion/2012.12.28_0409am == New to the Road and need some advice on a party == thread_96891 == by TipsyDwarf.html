				Hello all,<br /><br />So I am new to the Road and have spent a ton of time reading the forums and browsing the shops in preparation for my first purchases.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a trip that is coming up in Early February and I am looking to purchase some cola, meth and MDMA (Pills).&nbsp; I will be traveling on a domestic flight so I will not be transporting large amounts and I am likely to just do the pill bottle method of bringing things on.&nbsp; As for the party supplies.. I have always had drugs supplied for me at any event or gathering I have been to and I have only tried meth and coke so as far as what I should be looking for I am fairly clueless.<br /><br />Here are my questions.<br /><br />Coke:<br />1.&nbsp; Does it really matter if it is rocky or not?&nbsp; I have always done crushed powder and in all sincerity it was in the upper midwest and was cut with all kinds of shit.<br />2.&nbsp; Best vendor that accepts newbie orders for Coke?&nbsp; (1-2g&#039;s) <br />3.&nbsp; Does it matter if it is white or tan?<br /><br />Meth:<br />1. Best vendor that accepts newbie orders?&nbsp; (We only snort so how about quality)<br /><br />MDMA:<br />1.&nbsp; I was looking at XTCEXPRESS and seeing all kinds of different tablets that looked cool but I have to remember that I will be transporting these in a pill bottle, what vendor is recommended that sells product that would resemble normal pills?&nbsp; (I take valium and seroquel valid RX&#039;s along with several others that would allow me to bring them in my checked luggage and should be ok.<br />2. None of my party mates have ever done MDMA so what would be a good dosage?&nbsp; This type of group usually drinks, hits the hot tub, plays cribbage, just real down low and mellow and they smoke a lot of pot.<br /><br />Obviously I know at the road I have researched a ton on PGP as well as FE for new sellers.&nbsp; I am prepared to use my real address and name encrypted in PGP.&nbsp; Am I forgetting anything?&nbsp; Any advice on traveling domestically with these drugs?&nbsp; Unfortunately, shipping will not be an option to my destination.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any answers!

				Festivilia answered most of your questions. I will say however, please do not get in a hot-tub when you are rolling, your body is already at an elevated temperature and the hot water will make it worse!

				As for Meth, Hammertime won&#039;t ask for you to finalize early<br />everything from his quality, price, stealth, shipping, customer service is top notch <br /><br />A fantastic experience from start to finish

				Can you provide more info regarding cannabis&#039; neuro-protective properties when combined with MDMA festivalia?<br /><br />I&#039;m interested, I&#039;ve never heard that before.

				Thank you all so much for the great advice!&nbsp; I def will not be taking valium prior to my trip for fear of interfering with MDMA and I likely will not be using seroquel either.<br /><br />Since the pill bottle is a bad idea and I was really thinking it was a good idea... what typically are some better ideas (PM me if you do not wish to share publicly)<br /><br />I have since re-thought the whole rolling experience and the Sauna + Hot Tub is a stupid combo... thanks for bringing that to my attention!<br /><br />

				everything seems well covered except for the domestic flight. I personally would never travel on a plane with any drugs, but I&#039;m a felon and could get a lengthy sentence for it. my buddy traveled from the east coast to Milwaukee with what was perceived to be Molly but iI think was cut with me th. he didn&#039;t take it and he came back with it. he made it fine but i considered it very ballsy

				Thanks Hooby!<br /><br />The amounts I am talking are 1-2 grams MAX and 5 pills so I think you are really right.&nbsp; Also, the destination and airport I will be flying out of are not exactly drug mecca&#039;s or desirable destinations for many.&nbsp; I only knew of the pill method being successful because years ago before all the body scanners and shit my friends brought some meth to Vegas that way.&nbsp; I also figured that the odds of any TSA person going through each individual pill would be less than 5% and as long as I am not bringing 10 bottles of meds full to the brim I don&#039;t see myself standing out.&nbsp; I just know I will not be putting anything in the Valium bottle which is a VALID RX because the chances of that getting stolen would be far greater than getting caught for the illegal items.<br /><br />So far the road is treating me good... I just hope my first orders are treated equally good
