				Thought with all these rumors &amp; people talking horrible shit on this site might be a good idea to post a little something to help the moral of our beloved SR team who is working behind the scenes to get this site up &amp; running, Likely better than ever before.<br /><br />Downtime for a website is a normal thing. I Think the only reason we are seeing such a reaction from this community is due to the addiction factor &amp; obviously the illegal aspect of what we are all doing. But don&#039;t forget if it wasn&#039;t for DPR &amp; crew most of you would still be buying off the street or not even had the chance to indulge with the drugs you now are so used to being able to easily access.<br /><br />So with that said, Thanks to everybody who makes SR possible &amp; risks their life&#039;s to keep it up. I am sure there are more who feel this way so lets try to keep this post clear of all the hate talk &amp; rumor talk &amp; just make it clear we appreciate what everybody behind the scenes has done &amp; is doing for us all.<br /><br />Here&#039;s to an awesome grand re-opening of SR,<br /><br />Thanks team.<br /><br />-Hedonisticshaman420

				I agree. Something of this scale must be a serious job to maintain. We&#039;re very grateful for what you guys do, and I&#039;m glad to see that things are slowly returning to normal.

				A big thanks for all the hard work which has been going on behind the scenes...<br />I work in IT and know from experience that everyone complains when the system is down, but never no thanks for when the system is kept running ... a lot of work goes on here and like been mentioned before , this isn&#039;t a Amazon or Walmart. This is a community who have made it a lot easier for us to get the &quot;goods&quot; we like in a very easy and safe manner ... <br /><br />Give the guys credit for what they are doing .. a big thanks to all the team on SR. <br /><br />A

				Am I retarded? Why can I not make a new thread??? What is up with that?<br /><br />I tried in the product offers forum.. didnt work. I tried on the SR discussions forum.. didnt work.<br /><br />All I want to do is find out if anyone is interested in oxy 80&#039;s!!! Pretty damn simple.<br /><br />

				Very happy to see things up &amp; running again smoothly, Hope everybody has been able to do business as usual as I got to place my first few orders in the last days :) Cant wait to become a vendor in a few months &amp; It is great to have the assurance in the back of my mind there is a team like the team working behind the scenes keeping things afloat on the site I will be vending on. Keep up the great work DPR &amp; crew. Makes me feel safe &amp; cozy :)

				Its great to have the site up again and it loks like people are getting orders out and again vendors being able to carry on buisnes. I think the past week made a lot of people realise how a great a thing we have going on here and how lucky we are to be part of it. A bit of downtime every now and then is worth it for the revolution!<br />Thanks SR team and dont be disheartned with all the nonesense on the forums in the past week.<br />donny<br />:)

				I echo all of what the others are saying and add much love,many good vibes and P.L.U.R to DPR and all of the work that is put into this site each and everyday to keep it up and running.This may not be the only site to sell all of our favorite drugs on the net but to my knowlege it is the largest and most established keep up the great work and ignore the paranoia and haters. LONG LIVE DPR AND THE SILKROAD!!!
