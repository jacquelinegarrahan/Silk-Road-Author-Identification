				I am wondering what happens when/if a customer fraudulently claims an order does not arrive? Is the vendor compensated if he/she can prove the package was sent? Wondering about this recently, just out of curiosity.

				As I understand it SR will back you up if you are right.. <br /><br />If you send something regular mail and it does not show and the client was aware that it was a no refund policy on regular mail, then he cant ask SR to refund his money.<br /><br />basically SR will Back up your rules and regulations as stated in your profile and in listings..<br /><br />So if you are clear about what you offer and what you don&#039;t offer then you should have no problem and not fall victim to scam.<br /><br />That&#039;s how I understand it.

				Johnmtl, that is not my exact understanding. You have to have some proof you mailed the item. Without that proof SR will side with the customer.

				you can just say in your profile that someone with less than X number of transactions doesnt get a refund/reship.<br /><br />so if someone with no transaction history orders from you they know that if it doesnt arrive they get nothing, people with a few transactions that have spent money seem to want to keep those stats looking good and dont want any refund rate on there so they are not going to pull this scam, at least not from a main account, thus it usually ocuurs with people with no transactions or with 10 transactions but they have bought 0.01btc digital items to fudge it.

				I know I&#039;ve been all over the forum crying about this...but<br />i&#039;m stuck in a situation where my vendor (hydrofarm) has already scammed multiple people including myself, thankfully my shit is in escrow still.<br />but at the Resolution, he has provided with a fake DCN and only offered 50% refund, which i checked and has arrived in New York, I don&#039;t even live there.<br /><br />Anyone have any idea what is going to happen and what I could do to get all of it back?

				I am curious, as it seems to me this is a non issue for experienced users of the road.<br />Yes, I have been scammed a few times, but learned each time. I believe in helping the newbies out. Just read my posts.<br /><br />First thing is the scamming rate really that high for vendors? Last I knew the answer was no. Keep the new buyers under control. Don&#039;t offer free samples, and don&#039;t believe bullshit.<br />As a vendor I think your attitude needs adjusting. Both sides assume some risk.<br /><br />Better would be to learn co-operation after all you can&#039;t be a vendor without buyers.<br />Buyers can&#039;t buy without vendors.<br />Start slow, and make friends, they will warn you of scammers.<br /><br />I hate DCN&#039;s but it&#039;s for the vendor&#039;s protection, not the buyers. No need to give me DCN unless I PM the package isn&#039;t here.<br />I have signed for packages, but my vendor explained why, even offered me a refund, which I gave back.<br />Takes some balls, walking in and signing for something.<br /><br />Do you really think this is a big problem?<br />I thought the biggest problem was moving the money. The government is watching ;)<br />

				Here is what I found out<br /><br /><br />Mtljohn(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, sorry to bother you guys again but I need some answers in regards to resolution.<br /><br />Lets say someone buys from me and takes a non signature required option. I clearly say in my listings that they have no guarantee, but I have been told that even if someone buys it without sig required and it never makes it there that you guys are gonna give them there money back...<br /><br />This makes no sense to me.. I am in Canada and there is no way to ship regular mail with a dcn without going into the post office which of course i will not do..<br /><br />so my question is as follows<br /><br />will SR honer my shipping policies?? do i need to take of regular shipping to protect myself from scammers..<br /><br />I am new to this and dont have money to be losing packages.. please advise...<br /><br />here is what is on each of my listings maybe this will help<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;*****REFUND POLICY*****<br /><br />I offer a 100% refund policy for lost packages that were shipped using the SIGNATURE REQUIRED option.<br /><br />What this means is If for whatever reason the shipping company loses the package or the package gets seized I will refund the full purchase price.<br /><br />The refund is only for LOST/SEIZED packages.<br /><br />if you chose NOT to sign for the package after taking the signature required option and the package is marked as undeliverable your guarantee will be VOID<br /><br />if you are not home when the courier comes to drop of the package and are advised to go pick up your package at a location and you DO NOT GO your guarantee will be VOID<br /><br />basically If someone(you, a friend, family member, THIEF) signs for package then the deal is complete, and funds will be expected to be released to me within 12 hours<br /><br />There is NO guarantee given on orders placed without taking the signature required option!!<br /><br />buy at your own risk.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Please advise<br /><br />John<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You refund policy is clearly and reasonably stated, and will be honored. The main point is that there is an option to avoid the no refund.<br /><br />~Vendor Support &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Ok here is a kick in the nuts.I have a SR resolution going right now the first time we exchanged our own words I offered 40% refund just enough to cover my costs of products &amp; shipping then SR Resolution stepped in ( useless in my opinion) they looked at it for 36hrs &amp; then return the problem to vendor/buyer to try and come to a end result so now nothing is being done I am still waiting for payment and SR Resolution still wants us to resolve this our selves .<br /><br />Here is the thing that gets me The buyer xinfogod made a purchase from another vendor here and has claimed to Sr that he never received the&nbsp; parcel from him So then he claims to SR .Then on my parcel with tracking # he claims&nbsp; I sent him a fake tracking # for his parcel so now this asshole has my Hash &amp; coins tied up the worst thing I think is SR wants us to solve their Resolution problems for them I figure if you have 1 claim as parcel never delivered then you claim it 3 days later on another vendor and both Vendors sell Hash to this asshole what would you Think I will not negotiate with a scammer and the more people that will add comments in the featured requests forums about Vendor/Buyer Contracts the faster we will be able to do more safe and un-interrupted&nbsp; sales and NO GOD DAM CHANCEOF SCAMMING Because they will have agreed to a contract and SR can then finalize their sales faster for vendors <br /><br />Please everyone go to the features request forum &amp; add your voice so we can have SR changed for a better &amp; great palce without these GOD DAM NEW &amp; OLD SCAMMERS
