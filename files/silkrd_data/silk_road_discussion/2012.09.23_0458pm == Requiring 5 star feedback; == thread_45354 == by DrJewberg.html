				I&#039;ve noticed that there are quite a few members that require that once you order, you must finalize early and leave a perfect feedback prior to their shipping. I could understand finalizing early (I could care less for small orders since I mostly order bulk), since the bitcoin rate is more unstable than cancer, but there should be a rule in place where vendors cannot demand 5/5 ratings, because that just helps vendors build a false reputation; and I&#039;m not sure about the rest of you, but when I started here I was at around 15 orders before I even looked in the forums, so just to keep new or old buyers safe from these sorts of things.

				No man think about it!<br /><br />Anything below 5/5 means the transaction was not completely satisfactory. Why should the seller have statistics that indicate he has done something bad? People will see him, look at his stats and think &quot;oh this is a new seller, obviously doing something wrong because of the stats&quot; and that&#039;s how the person will perceive the seller, ignoring him in the future. <br /><br />Besides, people would forget to change it back. Man you earn all those 5/5 then one little cunts fucks it up with a 1/5 and all of a sudden your stats are fucked even though you have all those 5/5s.

				If you&#039;re a great vendor that has 100% positive feedback, you won&#039;t need to worry about that &quot;cunt that fucks it up&quot; because you would have given them the same excellent service as the rest of your customers. <br />But I completely agree with everything jameslink2 stated, so yeah. I think admins should enforce it on the market.

				I definitely agree i will not be supporting these vendors - i had never seen a vendor REQUIRE you leave 5/5 feedback until recently... wtf is up with that??<br /><br />the feedback system is there for a reason and if you are unwilling to actually provide a level of service to EARN your reputation rather than requiring just to boost ones seller rating/score. bullshit -<br /><br />the vendor deathb4dishonor has over TEN pages of feedback in the last week, ALL finalized early and all listings with the stipulation that no matter whether your order arrives, whether the product or service is absolute shit... no matter what - you agree to leave a 5/5. fucking dishonorable if you ask me<br /><br />i can understand vendors wanting people to leave 5/5 if they FE rather than a lower score while waiting for the order (although as was mentioned no feedback should be submitted, just FE then wait till order arrives to submit feedback), but certainly not this requiring false feedback score even after the order arrives

				Thought I&#039;d add - it&#039;s not that straightforward when one has just joined SR and is looking to do first time business. I wrote to vendors I thought would be good to do business with. Some replied. Others didn&#039;t. I thought that was the best way to start a reputation. In the cases of those who said &quot;sure thing&quot; and invited my custom, all required I FE. What&#039;s a new guy supposed to do? <br /><br />We are here because the sellers in RL have rubbish that is expensive to boot. We can&#039;t dicate to&nbsp; vendors that will deal with newbies. They have the power and if we want to be part of the community and build a trading reputation&nbsp; - we have to do as the vendor asks. After several succesfull transactions we no longer have to FE and can at that point forth enjoy protection.<br />

				This is a great thread and I understand where the OP is coming from but I view it from a different perspective. The way I see it is that if a vendor is requiring FE and good feedback that is between that vendor and their customers, I am not buying so whats the difference to me.
