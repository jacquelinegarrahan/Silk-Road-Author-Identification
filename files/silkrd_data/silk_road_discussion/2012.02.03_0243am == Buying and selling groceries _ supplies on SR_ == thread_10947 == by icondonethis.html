				Does anyone else think it&#039;s a good idea to also include selling normal household items such as office supplies, packaged food items, and any other simple / regular item that might be commonly purchased in one&#039;s regular day-to-day life?<br /><br />I remember someone from Australia interested in buying American cereal the other day (I think that&#039;s what it was), something that makes me think that it would also be good for people interested in seeing what other countries have to offer for food in comparison to the kinds they find in their own. Shipping might be expensive, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;d be good for novelty purposes once in a while (importing food products).<br /><br />The reason this idea comes to mind is because of having surplus BTC that I don&#039;t feel like transferring into &quot;real&quot; cash. <br /><br />If I could just buy supplies, food, drinks, etc. on SR, I don&#039;t really know if I&#039;d ever really have to leave my place...

				It&#039;s an interesting idea... a great novelty, at least. But I don&#039;t think there&#039;d ever be enough interest.

				Seems like there are already plenty of clearnet sites dedicated to food import/export, and the quality and range would be high.<br /><br />

				This is actually an amazing idea. I think another thing about it would really make use of the free market for something other than weapons and drugs. I think it would shine a light on bitcoin as an actual currency, rather than drug exchange coins.

				There&#039;s definitely some demand for novelty items like warweed described, but I don&#039;t think anyone wants to do their grocery shopping on SR.

I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s a lot of vendors out there that probably have tons of BTC that they have to convert into real money at some point and it&#039;d probably be a lot easier to get daily life accomplished via the internet as much as possible if they can... If anyone has large leftover sums of BTC, what&#039;s the point of having it if it&#039;s hard to use?

				New thoughts: <br /><br />I also think this would be good for some people that wanted to make some extra BTC that did NOT want to get involved in the vending of illicit materials. Since some items might be worth more in other parts of the world, I think that we could take our items and sell them on here for probably a little bit more than they might go for in real life. It would be like paying a premium on certain items when items are being rationed... only the premium (or tax) would be that using BTC cost more for every day items, but at least there wouldn&#039;t have to be as much conversion into real currency (which there are also fees for)... Domestic items could be shipped pretty cheaply I&#039;m sure, so we wouldn&#039;t have to worry about paying too much for that...

				I think it would be much more difficult to ship food through customs rather than drugs&nbsp; :P
