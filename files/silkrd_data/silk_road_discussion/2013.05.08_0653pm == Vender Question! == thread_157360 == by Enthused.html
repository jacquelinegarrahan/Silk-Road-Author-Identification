				Howdy Dudey! ^_^<br /><br />Basically we&#039;ve had a customer place an order but his address is worrying us a little. Its to Student Housing :S&nbsp; Would it be safe to send to their address? I think we&#039;re probably over-reacting but just making sure :)<br /><br />Thankies,<br />Moo x

Make extra sure your product is well hidden, and pay attention to small details. You possibly could ruin this kids life if you send him a package with shitty stealth.

				Yup if your stealth is good you will be fine. I have shipped to both a UK school and a Canadian campus several times, successfully.

				As everyone has already mentioned, just make sure you practice good stealth!&nbsp; I would guess that there are a lot of orders going out to student housing / dorms / frats / sororities without the vendor knowing (or caring) - nothing inherently wrong with shipping to those places, just make sure you have good safety practices and good packaging too.&nbsp; You should be fine!

				I&#039;d say that screams - &quot;Don&#039;t do it!&quot; .&nbsp; Send a fake one first, and ask the recipient to &quot;login to your account and PM me&quot; at least. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen so many vendor rules about no PO Box (while I know some will ship to those), no &quot;Post Restante&quot; and other &quot;no-nos&quot;, though you&#039;ll always find an exception to the rule. <br /><br />I try to stay out of the rumour mill of SR, but I can&#039;t help remembering a story that sucked me in, about an American college campus where a bunch of &quot;kids&quot; (let&#039;s face it) - ordered a shitload of &quot;molly&quot; (X), to a frathouse, and being a frathouse with every move being Facebooked/Twittered and God knows what, - THEY GOT BUSTED!<br /><br />Haven&#039;t heard of any other SR busts in the US before or since that one.<br /><br />If I were a vendor? - I&#039;d cancel the order. - If you think there&#039;s a&nbsp; good enough chance it will go off without a hitch, then at least send a notification letter first, asking them to PM you. This may save both of you a lot of headaches and regret. <br /><br />But, hey, that&#039;s just one persons opinion.
