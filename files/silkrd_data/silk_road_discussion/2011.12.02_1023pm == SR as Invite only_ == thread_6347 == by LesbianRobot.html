				I was just thinking, in an attempt to slow down all of the traffic that has been surrounding &quot;The Road&quot;, does anyone else agree that he should privatize it and make it an invite only site from now on? I mean, I think it would thwart some scammers and all of the heavy and bad press that has been infecting SR lately...what is everyone else&#039;s opinion on this idea?

				...thats means you&#039;d have to know someone who is probably trying their upmost to remain anonymous. how does that help the individual?<br /><br />there has to be a better way to weed out the scammers.<br />

				the end solution lies in unfortunately complicating but expanding on the whole buy/sell SR model.<br />...trust or proof of uniqueness of the user in an anonymous network.<br /><br />

				We&#039;ve all been to a Rock&#039;n Hot Night Club or exclusive Hang Out. Once the Riff-Raff and Thugs start to over take the place, it soon dies out. I think it would be best to have a Tiered System of Membership. Silver, Gold and Platinum. If you have Zero Sales, a Plat Membership would be Costly, but you would get full access and perks. If you have over X Sales, Plat would not be so expensive. Silver would only allow you to Purchase a set BC amount..<br /><br />I dont know..SR has the final sale..one thing is getting excited about lots of Numbers, but as you Increase Numbers, you Increase the Odds of Letting in a Scammer, a Con, or an LEO.

				The expression, &quot;A fool and his money are soon parted&quot; is quite accurate on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I am convinced that there exists no fool proof AND easy way to prevent scammers in an anonymous environment.&nbsp; There will always be scammers.&nbsp; We just have to make it more difficult for scammers and that is what these forums are for.&nbsp; If a person refuses to read these forums in spite of repeated encouragement to do so and then they get scammed than I frankly dont have much pity for them.&nbsp; As a new buyer you might be understandably asked to finalize early - if you are buying from one of the long standing, reputable vendors then you have nothing to worry about.&nbsp; If you are a new seller you must go through escrow and if you dont want to sell to a buyer with no history, then I dont blame you.&nbsp; Eventually you will build the rep to demand out of escrow purchases from unestablished buyers.&nbsp; <br /><br />If both buyers and sellers are established there is no reason to go out of escrow.

				theoretically the more buyers and sellers the more competitive ....and the costs work themselves out just like currency does...blah blah<br />cause SR to be too difficult to find or &quot;trade&quot; doesnt really grow...or grow exponentially out of control and comes crashing down.<br /><br />i just think it ends up being the quick fix quick solution ...throw some money at it....or government creating yet another tax...and who pays for it....we do..<br />because what usually happens is margin gets smaller and smaller, the constant taxes and people to pay as it changes hands hikes up the price, and the result is quality suffers as the real ingredient is cut or substituted with shit.<br />as long as it doesnt hamper up and coming decent sellers trading. the rich aren&#039;t rich for nothing you know..<br /><br />whatever is worked out the burden on the seller and buyer should not be forgotten.<br />some sellers are supplementing their income<br />others it is their income<br /><br />and buyers costs just escalate as we all know as we&#039;re all ultimately in the same boat.<br /><br />has anyone thought what it costs to run a proper PC or run an internet service like SR or any web service. <br />and we thought computers and internet were supposed to do reduce the cost to produce something.<br /><br />

				<br />I am pretty new to SR, but I immediately fell in love with its anonymous nature and its openness to all people.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know that limiting either of these things would be beneficial to SR.&nbsp; Even if restricting members would lead to less new scammers, it would also limit the number of new legitimate buyers.&nbsp; As deniedwings already mentioned, using information on the forums goes a long way toward identifying scammers and making safe purchases.

				^ +1.&nbsp; Think back to when you first came across a site such as this.&nbsp; How would you feel if you had to be invited to join?&nbsp; Like the lady or gentleman stated above me, as long as we have a community forum such as this it&#039;s really not all that hard to avoid scammers.&nbsp; If you are skeptical of someone, discuss it privately through encrypted channels with the person.&nbsp; If they are legitimate, they shouldn&#039;t have a problem having a civilized conversation with you to clear up any doubts you may have.&nbsp; If you are unable to resolve through those means, there&#039;s a great Rumor Mill sub forum where you can let your opinions be heard and get feedback from more seasoned members.<br /><br />Also try to avoid becoming cynical of new people asking technical questions, everyone has to start somewhere.&nbsp; A little common courtesy and common sense goes a long way towards protecting yourself and keeping services like this going.
