				you should NEVER and i mean NEVER order form anyone who says you need a signature. This website&#039;s saftey is partly owned to plausible deniability, and you screwed that pooch if you sign for it. Find different vendors, because i have tried many products on here and never had to sign for anything.

				its an anomaly for people to use that and whether he is legit or not is not my main worry. if it gets caught on my end through domestic customs and something is set up, by signing it i am screwed. all the dealers i have had great transactions with never make you sign and frown upon it. i think it makes sense and it is an unnecessary risk but to each their own. i would just rather be safe then sorry

				I had to sign for an order because the package was too large to fit in my box.&nbsp; I was pretty freaked out by seeing that little USPS &quot;come get your package&quot; slip, and I almost didn&#039;t do it.&nbsp; However, the circumstances surrounding the situation were such that it was pretty much impossible that anything was amiss, and so I did it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened to me other than about 10 minutes of serious paranoia, but there&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;d ever do it again.

				I would never sign for an order! That&#039;s like the first red flag that something isn&#039;t right. If they ask me to sign I know something is wrong and will refuse. Also I know what my mailman looks like. So if there ever was an undercover postal inspector trying to deliver to me I would know right away.

				I&#039;ve signed for plenty of packages. You just cant be silly. People always worry about getting in trouble, but dont wanna research, seems they just want blind comfort. If your package comes through without detection at a sorting center, what further steps is someone at your local office,whos taking your sig, going to take to bust you? Your package would have to be busted in half, or smelling like whatever is inside. Not signing is never going to help you if you claim ownership by physical possession of a package that has been detected. They dont sit around and wait for you to pick your mail up. You just have to know procedure, I dont think anyone is as familiar with mail service as they should be. <br /><br />My advice: know how your package is being sent, and make sure everything matches on your side. If you know you have to sign, inspect the package before signing. Dont go signing things like a moron,without even reading them.&nbsp; The only suspicion you can rouse is going to happen reguardless of signature, before you ever get to that point. Any extra worry you have is your own fault because being too nervous to have a face to face interaction with another human being in a postal building is definitely going to make you look more suspicious than anything.<br />
