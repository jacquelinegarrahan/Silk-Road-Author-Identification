				ChronicPain, you are a very hard working mod and Silk Road appreciates your efforts. I am happy to donate. Its just a small amount and you deserve more but I will give what I can when I can to at least show that I am thankful. This is a special website and part of that is directly because we have good mods that work their ass off and the entire community reaps the benefits.

				Thank you mods. I feel kind of guilty that there are people working hard on this site even more I love it. I haven&#039;t noticed before that I could donate BTC to most vital people on SR and now intend to. I&#039;ve always wondered what to do with my extra BTC and now I have a place to send it that is deserving, unlike those damn lotteries. I&#039;m make sure the next time I put BTC in my account to put in a little extra so I can show some gratitude.

				is there a possible way to blacklist certain words? a long time ago i ran a forum and could change words, ie Girlfriend = boyfriend. but i was thinking, maybe you could enter www.mtgix.com to change to something else that way people cant be scammed whilst waiting for mods

				If I could ban with keywords I would but I don&#039;t have that option. All I can do is ban via their name, email or IP and obviously the IP one is pointless. I will speak to DPR or Indica and try and get them to implement this. I am banning the new accounts as I go along but I am busy with other stuff too so just bare with me. Banned loads today already. I tell you if I could find out who they were I&#039;d run the little cunt over and then reverse back just to make sure he felt it.
