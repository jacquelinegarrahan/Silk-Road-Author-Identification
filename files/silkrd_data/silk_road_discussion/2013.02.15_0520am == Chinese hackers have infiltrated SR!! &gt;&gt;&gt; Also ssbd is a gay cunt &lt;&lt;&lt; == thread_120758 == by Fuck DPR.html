				No no no i tried to clear this up in another thread. Its not the chinese<br />I know a guy who knows a guy who knows charlie sheens dog told me wats going on. <br />The lastest meteor that hit russia this morning was actually a new secret weapon the usa deployed against dpr&#039;s headquarters. Little is known but luckily he was able to assimilate into the binary code of the terminal he was using to escape. Since sr was his open page at the time this extra code in the system took the form of bitcoins in the network appearing randomly in peoples wallets. <br />After reassembling in the next few hours once enough btc network confirmations can be made (which takes a while with a whole person ofc) he plans to reopen and deploy an offensive on the corrupt governments of the world by facilitating the sale of more drugs to more people than the world has ever seen before! <br />However there are fears since they form the transcended dpr if anyone was able to spend of these btc and they cant be recovered he may suffer symptoms of a stroke victim.
