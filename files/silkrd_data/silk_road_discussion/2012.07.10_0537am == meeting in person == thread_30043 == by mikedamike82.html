				What&#039;s so bad in getting it through the mail? Can&#039;t you wait that long?<br />There&#039;s no justifiable reason to want to meet in person, full stop.<br /><br />Personally, one of the good things about us using Tor and Bitcoins here is, it&#039;s almost an entry test to weed out the risk taking, security breaking, lazy idiots. Because it requires a bit of research and effort at the beginning, it implies that a persons willing to spend the time and effort to keep to the level of security required by Silk Road, for every ones safety. In other words, not just any old Tom, Dick or Harry is one click from ordering some of the worlds most dangerous drugs (as the media would have you believe), although the odd one does seem to get through from time to time (op?).

				I would say, deal with people in person at your own risk.<br /><br />I would NOT RECOMMEND IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU MEET THE PERSON THROUGH SILK ROAD. It is far better off to just stick to online-only transactions, even if the person happens to live 10 minutes from you. Don&#039;t be an idiot. Keep yourself protected and safe.

				I think meeting for small/big deals is a bad idea, especially in this case. I`m not really sure why one would come to SR just to find a local dealer.... I do like meeting new people and documenting though, so I would be willing to meet people. I have nothing on me, so I can`t imagine being arrested/taken-away for no reason. Anyway I don`t think its really smart to meet in person. It would kind of defeat the purpose of coming to SR in the first place..
