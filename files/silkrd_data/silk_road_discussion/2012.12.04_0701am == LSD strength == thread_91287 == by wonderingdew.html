				I&#039;ve been doing some reading on Erowid and other places lately, and every bit of independent research done over the last 10 years, including LE tests, points to the average hit of acid, globally, being around 50µg.<br />This page (http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_article3.shtml) says out of 11 samples in Spain in 2005, &quot;38.81 µg was the average quantity detected.&quot;<br />From 6 samples in Switzerland the same year, &quot;50.1 µg was the average...&quot;<br />From 97 to 2003, the Spanish NIT sampled 2,182 blotters. The average: 69.22 µg.<br />Citing all available research, Erowid concludes: &quot;Absolute average concentration, counting all the analyzed batches: 53.38µg.&quot;<br /><br />So how does every seller on SR claim to have 200µg blotters, if nobody has ever tested blotters that high globally in the last 30 years?&nbsp; ???

				either because they are very close to the supplier or have access to non-blotter forms which have great reputation and more accurate doses.

				or, because the majority of them are lying. there are a few which are telling the truth that have been labtested. check out the LSD avengers thread for more info about that :) dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0

				There&#039;s been less of the 200ug+ claims lately, but SR vendors tend to get the well laid/dropped hits and have been community-nudged to report accurate doses

				i know i&#039;m new but i&#039;ve rarely seen 200+mic blotters. maybe the sr blotters just appear a bit stronger because they&#039;re shipped out faster and consumed sooner? i know acid degrades relatively quickly if improperly handled

				Dear Thread: Average does not mean maximum. The AVERAGE of the tests is low. In NO WAY does that mean that high-strength blotter is impossible. It just means it is uncommon, thus the low average. And why is it less common? Because less blotter has to be laid, as well. More per hit means less sheets means less on the street. It&#039;s also harder to make a profit on because convincing someone to shell out $30 for one tab is harder than $30 for 3 tabs, even if they have the exact same amount of LSD on them.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />BR-Conjectures.
