				I know, this is evil but look at my username.<br /><br />Someone fucked me over so bad.&nbsp; I mean so bad that I would kill them if I thought I could get away with it.<br /><br />Now, I want to make an order, but I want to ensure it is discovered and a controlled delivery is made.&nbsp; I will have it delivered to <br />him and when they sign, he will go to jail.&nbsp; He is a known coke head and the cops know he is a coke head.&nbsp; I nice fat bag of flake<br />will do it.&nbsp; But is there a vendor out there who will send without caution except to protect themselves?&nbsp; If so I will make it very worth you<br />while.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will not go into detail about what this person did.&nbsp; I will say, anyone of you would likely beat or kill this person too.&nbsp; I am just<br />trying to affect him the way he has affected me.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think any vendor would take a chance doing this ... I also think these kinds of things / ideas are frowned upon here.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry for whatever happened, man, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll find much support for this here.&nbsp;

				This is a bad idea for all parties involved. Know that karma is real and take solace in knowing that he will get his eventually, whether it be sooner or later.
