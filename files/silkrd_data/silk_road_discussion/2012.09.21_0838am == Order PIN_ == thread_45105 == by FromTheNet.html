				You have to message SR staff and explain your situation.&nbsp; Then your going to have to wait a week I believe to prove your not trying to steal someones money by using their account.

				Shouldn&#039;t be hard to prove, since the account&#039;s been empty for a year until I just loaded it today heh.<br /><br />Going to try and search for a staff member to message.

They&#039;d get half as many of these or less if everyone understood the reset process a little better.<br />1. Enter 5 incorrect PINs to lock it. At this point an automated message will be sent to you by Support, notifying you to reply &quot;in 7 days,&quot; meaning after at least 7 days, to have your PIN finally reset.<br />2. Wait 7 days. Not 4 days, not 2 days, and certainly not 5 minutes. Feel free to wait 14 days, just make sure it&#039;s 7+.<br />3. Reply and wait for new message telling you to log out and in.<br />4. Log in and set new PIN.<br /><br />Why does Support make you wait 7 days to have your PIN reset? It&#039;s in case your account has been compromised, and someone else is attempting to empty your wallet. Assuming any identifying information may be compromised with your account, the one thing Support can do is give you a week to find out that someone else locked your PIN and message them that it wasn&#039;t you, before they can take your money.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is no other way to reset your PIN, and it is your responsibility to ensure you remember it. There is no point bothering DPR with such trivial matters.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Am I crazy or was there a time when there was not a PIN?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t used silk road in over a year and I don&#039;t remember ever HAVING a pin when I ordered something...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So I have been caught in this confounded pin reset mess. That sucks. Is there ANY way out of this? My funds are locked up for a week?

				you are correct K, pins were implemented later into the existence of SR at a time when they were trying to combat phishing with the old url. you probably never set one.<br /><br />you dont need to contact dpr, use the &quot;contact us&quot; link at the bottom right of SR... thats how you should always contact support<br /><br />and they say you have to wait seven days, but if you are respectful and explain your situation without an attitude... in my case similar to yours they reset my pin right away.

				oh wow... deja vu.<br />i just loaded my account today after almost 6 weeks of making sure i had most of this figured out. Placed my first order, and came up empty headed at the PIN. <br />&nbsp;I couldn&#039;t even remember ever seeing that before, even when i first registered. Completely drew a blank. <br />I was really getting&nbsp; concerned after i tried 3 different numbers and no luck.. I just loaded a wad of money, and only had 2 tries left.<br />&nbsp;Luckily i had used my damn cellphone voicemail pin, which is my go-to access code for most random stuff.<br />Got it on the 4th try....<br />Had my heart beating for a minute though!

				i actually got confused the first time i made a purchase after setting my pin initially. <br /><br />to me &quot;PIN&quot; just sounds like a number, but i set mine as just another password so trying all the numbers i woulda used didnt work, but a password i use did

				&nbsp;::) <br />oh wow..so you&#039;re saying you DIDNT have to use a number???&nbsp; i read it same as you.<br />A PIN by definition IS a number (personal identification number)...i guess &quot;Account Password&quot; or something would make more sense huh?
