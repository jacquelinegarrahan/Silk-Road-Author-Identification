				Hey guys,<br /><br />Just checked on my purchasing stats after completing a couple more successful orders, and to my horror discovered that I have lost 30 transactions or so according to my purchasing stats!<br /><br />Does anybody know why this is? I know it says &quot;Recent Purchasing Statistics,&quot; so do they automatically reset after you&#039;ve made so many purchases? Or do they only keep track of purchases made within the past X amount of months??<br /><br />After finalizing these two orders, my purchasing stats SHOULD HAVE been something like this:<br />Total transactions: 44<br />Total Spent: $4,500ish<br />Refund rate: 0<br />Auto Finalize: 0<br />Member for: 10 months<br /><br />I was VERY proud of these purchasing stats, and because I have made so many purchases, and spent so much money I could do business with virtually ANY vendor without having to finalize early and all that crap... It also helps when making large purchases (over 500$) to have those high stats available, that way vendors know that I have in fact done business on here with large sums of money successfully in the past... To my complete horror and dismay, I checked my purchasing stats today, and they have dropped WAY down.. I have gone from 44 purchases, to 13 purchases; from $4,500 spent, to only $758 spent.&nbsp; In the 10 months I have been actively purchasing on Silk Road, my stats have ALWAYS been accurate and this has NEVER happened to me before.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I am very pissed off about it, because I like to make large purchases and this effects my ability to do so as a buyer... They basically eliminated my history of successful transactions for large sums of money... now no vendor has any reason to believe I am legit and have a solid history of making purchases for larger amounts of money.. This is a terrible blow to the way I do business here on SR. With my prior stats, I NEVER had to finalize early (even on orders over $1,000)... Now that might change, and I do NOT finalize early for anyone.. I essentially got fucked over huge here.<br /><br />Here are my purchasing stats now;<br /><br /><br />Total transactions: 13<br />Total spent: $758.36<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 10 months<br /><br /><br />Does anybody know why this happened?? Is there anyway I can get some record of those other 30 or so purchases I&#039;ve made on here??? I doubt it :(<br /><br />If anyone else has experienced this, or if anybody knows why this happened, please fill me on... Pretty shitty to work for 10 months at building a successful business reputation on here, only to log on and find it has almost all been eliminated over night :(<br /><br />Thanks for the input in advance, I appreciate it

				Me too. From 5 to 0. It&#039;s even more sad because I just had enough stats to throw away this crap with FE.
