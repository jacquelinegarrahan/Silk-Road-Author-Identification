				put the powder in the middle of 1 piece of toilet paper. then fold up and twist the top so the powder is snug in a kind of ball form,. you can tear off the excess toilet paper above where you twisted it. then just take it like a pill. or if you can find a capsul such as a vitamin supplement that uses gel capsules, empty it of all its contents,(there will be residue left but its vitamins it cant hurt more than what your taking lol)&nbsp; then use a folded piece of paper to scrape the powder into the capsule, you can take it as a half or a whole depending on what you prefer on time release.

				It can be MIXED with water but if I remember correctly Valium is not water soluble, and so you can&#039;t dissolve a set amount in a set amount of water and then just drink a portion of the water to measure the dose like you can with some powdered drugs.&nbsp; Like 1g of drug in 500 ml of water, so 5ml =10 mg of drug.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you have powdered Valium you will need accurate mg scales, otherwise things could get messy.<br /><br /><br />Alternatively you can just keep halving the pile by eye:<br />1g into 2 500mg, 4 250mg,&nbsp; &nbsp;8 125mg, 16 62.5mg,&nbsp; &nbsp;32&nbsp; 31.25mg<br /><br />Then split one of these into 3 and you&#039;ve&nbsp; got a rough dose!!!<br /><br />I do not recommend this method!

				I think it&#039;s fat soluble, so dissolve some in full fat milk and squirt it up your bum. My brother claimed to have used this method successfully but this is not neccasarily an endorsement

Even 2mg knocked me out!<br /><br />The powder, its better value than buying but if the average doze is 10mg (most generic dizepam is 10mg) the gram of powder is 100 10mg servings.<br /><br />My advice would be take the tablets. That powder, you could build up a tolerance fast and be doing 50-60mg in a week if it became a full time hobby!<br /><br />Diazepam is a fanstastic med - any doc would prescribe it to anyone who took too much stimulants or was losing the plot a little - panic attack and so on.<br /><br />It works. But be careful, it IS addictive, and best used as a drug that you take as needed. <br /><br />A few weeks back, we had an &#039;incident&#039; in work. Guy almost died! So, he was shaking like a leaf - no way could he drive. Red put him up the night and prescribed 10mg dizepam. Nexy day, we had a good story, guy was fine, and you need to study the doseages of drugs ALWAYS. 10mg of diazepam, at worse, on its own (not with alcohol) is harmless. For me it would make me go to sleep.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />So not a pub drug!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />Just don&#039;t snort it!!! It will taste awful and might hurt! You always swallow this drug. Mixing with water based drinks is fine, dabbing a bag of 1 gram is not for newbies. Buy the pills, if you have any use for that drug then a gram would last a long time indeed unless you go silly and use daily. Then, diazepam will be a shit drug. Like heroin. You use more just to not feel like shit but pay money all the time. <br /><br />So, addiction potential. could kill anyone silly enough to go greedy on it and never inject&nbsp; - leave that to the hospital to decide! (which I hope you never need)<br /><br />Basically, like any decent drug, great if you know what your doing. Very useful stuff. Helps you sleep when you went a bit too enthusiastic on the yayo or dex or even E or shrooms. Great for people on LSD losing the plot&nbsp; ;D Seriously, it would stop a bad trip if administered right.<br /><br />IF you have a gram bag - try to sort out the doses one night. Bit of work but worth it. Buy some cheap capsules, do 10mg or 20mg.&nbsp; Avoid as a daily drug unless you really really need it. Valium itself is still prescribed but its usually serious mental illness and it really is a medication and not just a street drug.<br /><br />Valium is being prescribed more by the way. A comeback? Hope so. I&#039;d spend prescription charge for 100 2mg tabs of the real thing by Roche. <br /><br />As for generics, research on the forums and look at feedback. If I had the choice, I&#039;d have Roche and to be honest I NEVER took more than 6mg Roche whilst generics, I could pop 3 on a really busy night! Not often but if needed Reds not staying up all night when a cure is at hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />Don&#039;t snort!<br /><br />Don&#039;t snort!!!<br /><br />KNOW your drug and KNOW your dosages and interactions!<br /><br />Peace you lazy idle drug abusing dick for brains! (joke)<br /><br />&nbsp;:)
