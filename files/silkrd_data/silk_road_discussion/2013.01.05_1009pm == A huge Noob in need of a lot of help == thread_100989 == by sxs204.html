				As you can see by the title of this topic, I&#039;m a pretty big noob on how to use the Silk Road. I&#039;m in need of help, so I don&#039;t endanger myself or a vendor. I also don&#039;t want to flat out screw up an transaction.<br />Here are a few questions I need some solutions too. Thank you a lot for you help!<br /><br />How do I convert US currency into Bitcoins?<br />How do I set up a wallet?<br />How to transfer bitcoins to my silk road account?<br />What is a PGP code? (This by far confuses me the most because I&#039;m not sure how to encrypt stuff as I have never done it before)<br />What is escrow?<br />Just overall questions that will give me answers to function properly on this site.<br />If there is already a noob guide out there, I&#039;m sorry for posting this. I&#039;d be glad to be kindly guided to it, and delete this post.

				A good place to get a wallet it blockchain.info.&nbsp; You can also do some reading there once you get your wallet and you can use one of their methods to acquire coins so you don&#039;t have to risk being scammed.&nbsp; A very respected member of these forums turned me onto them and i&#039;ve loved it thus far.<br /><br />BTW you can access blockchain.info via TOR or clearnet
