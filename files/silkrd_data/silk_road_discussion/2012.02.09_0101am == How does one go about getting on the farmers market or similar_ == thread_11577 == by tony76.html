				I know you have to be invited... but how? I don&#039;t really talk to many people..<br /><br />I think my feedback/reviews speak for themselves... maybe someone can talk to someone and see if they would like some of my products over there?<br /><br />I would be forever grateful!

				&nbsp; FM is a site that has been evolving for about 8 years now, it started out as a mailing list then a forum until it made its first selling site then changed its name when it started to focus more on resellers instead of being used by its creator for selling his product. There is actually two of them the FM for newbies to prove they can be trusted then the PFM&nbsp; (private farmers market) for established clients.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It is mostly a Cannabis site with only limited hallucinogens. It is nothing like SR as they are VERY strict in what is allowed to be sold on there with weed or extracts (lots of Maroc hash) so you will not find any of the hard stuff available there. Also they do not use Bit coins, it is pecunix or cash.

				TFM seems sketchy to me... especially this weird split between the public and private areas. Couple that with the fact that there&#039;s only a handful of vendors who pretty much only offer bulk products, with no form of guarantee... I won&#039;t be throwing my money that way anytime soon.

				Used the public FM for my first darknet purchase, as well as BMreloaded. Both were a great deal and work out very good. Now I can use the private FM, and they have quite a large selection, but it can be verrry pricey.

Insurance is 20% on top of the already fairly high prices. What do you mean about the &quot;weird split&quot;? There are a lot of reasons I really like that place, I think I will be a customer for a while. Op, if you&#039;re interested in becoming a seller there, they&#039;re not really interested in what you deal in. I really wish they would allow MDMA (or even MDA), but other than that the selection is really great I think.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11577.msg108497#msg108497">Quote from: ProudCannabian on February 09, 2012, 02:21 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> is the secure site...

Good thing you don&#039;t have the private store link...seeing as you&#039;re the type to openly post it on a public forum. :/

				you don&#039;t need screen shots.<br /><br />they have high quality bud, hash, some edibles, and LSD for the public side. there are NO opiates, NO molly, NO amphetamines, NO RCs, NO Viagra (that includes the private side). Just basic psychedelics and MMJ products.<br />The prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for. The service is professional, and they don&#039;t have the scamming problem that plagues SR.
