				ok lets say you buy 10mg of fentanyl. thats&nbsp; 1 gram of pure morphine ~. You get syringe 10-20 ml and dilute powder in the water lets say 10ml if you have good opiod tolerance. Now you have liquid which contains 1mg/1ml fentanyl thats 100mg of morphine thats still alot. So now get 1ml syringe and for sawety reasons draw 0.1-0.3ml and inject/ if you want to snort it buy a syringe with detachable needle and slowly drop in your nose but try not to get it into your throat. And see if you ned more do more thats the safest way i can think of. Buy fentanyl HCL.

If fentanyl would be in vials in stable dose it probably wouldn&#039;t have happened. Thats why I say buy the powder 99.8% dilute it and just do the math.<br /><br />P.S. It sounds dangerous 100mg patch and if you licked it all out thats like 10 grams of morphine pure. Interesting just how much did you get out of those 100mg. That&#039;s def more dangerous in my opinion than diluting.

				1mg fentanyl HCl=14mg morphine sulfate. so.....<br />1000 mcg fenatnyl HCl=14000 mcg Morphine Sulfate<br /><br />an &quot;average&quot; person with no opioid tolerance can tolerate 25-75 mcg fentanyl&nbsp; IV without respiratory support.<br /><br />tolerant users should begin at 100 mcg IV and work up. 250 mcg IV (0.25mg) will rock most peoples world.<br /><br />soo...a good dilution scheme is:<br /><br />1mg (0.1g)fentanyl HCL in 20 cc NS or sterile water will yield a 50mcg/cc injection.<br />i would not recommend mixing a smaller amount of powder unless you have an analytical balance and are capable of measuring micrograms accurately. the potential for measurement error is too great when dealing in micrograms. <br />&nbsp;

				There is a Vendor who has Fent powder on here and also offers Nasel spray bottles with 50mg and then one with 100mg .. There listed at a awesome price. <br /><br />EB- I agree now that i know what Fent is that eating a whole 100mcg patch was not smart at all, I was in my late teens then and had no clue how strong and dangerous the drug is. Also i use to have a 3 80mg A day Oc habbit along with other pills so thats what saved me from ODing eating one of that many mcg the first time.. <br /><br />Iv herd there even cutting Heroin with Fent these days..

				damn! math like that is how people die&nbsp; &nbsp;.1g is NOT 1 mg.<br />.001g is a mg or milligram meaning thousandth of a gram not a tenth of a gram!!&nbsp; &nbsp;if you follow your .1g per 20cc formula i&#039;m pretty sure you are gonna be shooting 5mg per cc enough to kill someone. watch your math.<br />

				thank you for the correction. regardless 1mg fentanyl=1000 mcg fentanyl. if you dilute it in 20 cc...you will get 50 mcg/cc.<br />as stated measuring 0.001g of powder accurately is hard enough...that&#039;s why you shouldnt try to measure less than a milligram. <br />

				Correct.&nbsp; to measure 1 mg you need a scale that is accurate to at least .1mg&nbsp; or .0001 grams.<br />remember scales have a tolerance, a scale that reads down to 1mg (.001 g) will commonly have a tolerance of plus or minus 1mg.&nbsp; &nbsp;So if you weigh out 5mg it could actually be 4 mg or 6mg or anywhere in between.<br />It is going to be safer for you to make large dilutions so small weighing tolerance errors don&#039;t compound so greatly.<br />sorry drugged rambling now..&nbsp; be safe :D
