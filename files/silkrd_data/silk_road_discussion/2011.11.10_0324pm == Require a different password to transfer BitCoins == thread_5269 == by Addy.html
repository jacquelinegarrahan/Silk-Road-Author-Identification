				I have never been phished or hacked, but I&#039;ve seen dozens of users who have. Wouldn&#039;t it make sense to require a different password to transfer BitCoins (and perhaps make purchases)? <br /><br />Just a thought.

				I have been phished and I&#039;ve only been here a week or two. I think the best solution I have mulled over in my head about it would be to add layers of security to btc LEAVING silk road. any btc on SR can be tracked so I&#039;d like to see withdraw have a long unique key added to it or a secondary password or something you are not likely to use when just logging into your SR to check your orders.

				This actually sounds like a pretty good idea and it shouldn&#039;t be that hard to implement!

				I agree also, and I have been on the other side of the phishing for quite some time. I suggested in another thread about phishing, but it appears that Silk Road doesn&#039;t care to stop people like me from taking your money.

				They could still buy stuff and send stuff to themselves. But in general souns like a good idea

				buying things for yourself from a phished account is a bit risky from a phisher standpoint, because if caught while seller still has address of the phisher, it could end badly. I know, I know, nobody here uses an address that they could be connected to, but still, if I can&#039;t withdraw the coins to a wallet and turn them in to cash, I am not phishing any more
