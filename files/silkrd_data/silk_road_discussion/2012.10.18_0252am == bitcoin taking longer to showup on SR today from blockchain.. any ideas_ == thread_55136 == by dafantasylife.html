				Hi. Im a newb so I don&#039;t understand what is going on today.. today I set up a cash deposit.. i usually go to my local wells but this time went to citibank.. still used bitinstant to transfer to blockchain..&nbsp; the funds showed up within the hour to blockchain.. i then transferred over to my SR address.. I haven&#039;t chnaged this address since I started.. and this is my 5th transfer to SR..&nbsp; i was hoping to login and see my SR account updated but its still not there.. and blockchain shows the UNCONFIRMED TRANSACTION for two transactions (amount was split into two different amounts)..<br /><br />I read something about having to change your SR address occasionally? anyway, its been about 5-6 hours now and nothing..&nbsp; usually takes me about 2 hours to show up on SR from blockchain.. <br /><br />whats the longest it will take? i need to rush an order.. should i be patient?

				Believe it or not it can take multiple days.<br /><br />The address bit is true, you have to renew your address every time, even though it&#039;s not documented anywhere that you should do so.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can also contact support to speed it up, although how to contact support is not documented in the tech support forum stickies.&nbsp; Hint:&nbsp; Go to the main site, not the forums, and look around the edges of the screen for it.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s also been a bad luck day for the miners it seems, multiple blocks taking longer than average to solve today.&nbsp; At least the couple I noticed anyway.&nbsp; That in itself will delay all transactions in the blockchain since new transactions get reported instantly but only appear on most BTC sites/exchanges after 6 verifications.&nbsp; If the blockchain is delayed that will domino effect any site that uses bitcoin.<br /><br />Shouldn&#039;t take days though unless part of the system happens to be broke when you deposit...and yes patience is a virtue.
