				Pardon me if this has come up before....<br /><br />I realized the other day that a conflict exists with the order rating/feedback system. Buyers from many highly rated vendors (or i guess you could say really any vendor) may feel pressure to give a 5/5 every time out of the expectation that not doing so might result in worse service or even rejection on future orders. Of course one could argue that buyers are free to use other vendors if they are dissatisfied, but there are not always vendors with substitute products. Im just concerned that this phenomenon is resulting in skewed ratings...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				That&#039;s true, but it&#039;s because anything less than 5/5 is supposed to be negative. I don&#039;t know how this started but it would be unfair if you give an honest 3-4/5 for an &quot;OK&quot; transaction, since everyone else gets 5/5 for that. You compensate for that by raising your standards, for example I never consider buying from a a vendor with less than 97%. <br />

				Right, I tend to choose vendors with over 97% myself. Generally these vendors are more sensitive to negative feedback (im not talking about giving less than 5/5 for OK service, Im talking about less than OK service). Even if they have a great track record, problems can still crop op....and lets suppose you make every effort to communicate w/ them before giving a rating; sometimes you can end up w a sub-par experience. Often times no one else has a substitute product available...and assuming you&#039;re still interested in making future orders with these guys, you&#039;re left risking reprisals for giving anything less than 5/5. <br /><br />Fortunately, the guys with 97+% tend to be good about resolving things should something go wrong. I&#039;m just speculating about scenarios where that is not the case...<br />

				My take on feedback... I agree 5/5 is kinda mandatory the way the system works if you want to deduct a point you must truly feel that something is substandard. I always look at vendors feedback but dont take 95-100% serious unless they have 300+ transactions as I am sure vendors get blackmailed for feedback all the time a vendor with 100% and 15 transactions hasn&#039;t truly earned that rating he just starts there IMO

				I feel that 5/5 is and should be mandatory for an order that was successful. I am new to SR but have spent much time reading Vendor Profiles and Feedback. One profile actually said &quot;Don&#039;t contact us with attitude like you&#039;re exchanging a fucking sweater to Wal-mart! This is an illegal transaction!&quot; (paraphrasing). That sounds about correct to me. Some of the feedback I&#039;ve read that were 3/5 or 4/5 were for quality issues posted by users who in the same sentence admit their tolerance is ridiculously high. Previous and subsequent posts would have excellent quality ratings. Quality can be a bit subjective for things like H or LSD due to geographical differences and user&#039;s experience. A 10 strip could be 300ug each tab and fresh, but pack that shit improperly, let it absorb moisture and light and ship it in a 170F airplane cargo bay. What defines a great Vendor is their Desire (rather than willingness) to resolve issues within reason.<br /><br />I have to wonder sometimes when I look at feed back that was 100 percent awesome for like 2 months then suddenly 4 people in a row suddenly didn&#039;t get their orders. and then business looks like it returned to good reviews again. Could it be feasible that a competing vendor could make 5 buyer accounts with intentions of spending 4 or 5 hundred dollars and leave the terrible reviews to stifle his nemesis? Said attacker would consider it an investment. Or am I being naive and this is not possible?<br /><br />Another thing I noticed was a Seller&#039;s ability to modify/update/change their item&#039;s listing for the purpose of keeping his/her Feedback for said item. I am not a vendor and I have no knowledge of what a Seller Account screen looks like. Is it possible for a vendor to give out cheap samples which result in excellent feedback and then change the info on the listing to describe a different item? Basically floating feedback from an old listing to be relevant to a new listing. <br /><br />Personally, I wont be trash talking any anonymous drug dealers who&#039;ve already handled my shipping info..... I don&#039;t know about other people&#039;s feelings, but I tend to be paranoid over such things.
