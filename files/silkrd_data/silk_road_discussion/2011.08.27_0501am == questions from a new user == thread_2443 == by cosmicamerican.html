				hello everyone.&nbsp; i am new to all of this and a lot of terms are hard for me to understand.&nbsp; i was wondering if i could get someone to clear things up for me.<br /><br />1. what is pgp, why is it important, and how do you use it?<br /><br />2. what is the best place to buy bitcoins?<br /><br />3. what do i do if my bitcoin &quot;provider&quot; gets hacked and i lose them all?<br /><br />4. how does one go about building a positive rep if they are not a seller?<br /><br />5. am i doing the wise thing in not buying from someone b/c they lack positive feedback even though they could be the most honest, trustworthy person on here?<br /><br />6. how do i encrypt something?&nbsp; isn&#039;t this site and the whole TOR thing encrypted already?<br /><br />thanks for any help i get and i hope SR can stay around for a very long time.

				1. pgp is encryption for files/messages it is important because it keeps a private conversation private. only the intended recipient can decode it. As to how to use it, search the forum...there is plenty on info on it all over.<br />2. there are tons of exchangers out there, shop for one who has reasonable fees, and payment types that you are compfortable with<br />3. IDK about others, but I use a bitcoin client stored on a thumb drive loaded with a full version of linux, have it set to access nodes through tor, and store an encrypted backup on yet another flash drive (they are cheap) Since I store my bitcoins locally, I am not worried about anyone getting &quot;hacked&quot;<br />4. same as you build reputation anywhere else you go...I&#039;m sure when you walk into a new bar, you don&#039;t throw beer caps at the bartender for no reason, and I bet you pay your tab... no different here. be an honest buyer, and honest sellers will treat you right.<br />5. don&#039;t make purchases based entirely on feedback. good feedback can be faked, but proper communication cannot. speak with vendors before you go start spending money... ask them some questions, and get a feel about what kind of person they are. just like a local dealer. if &quot;it&#039;s none of your fucking business&quot; is the answer to your questions, don&#039;t give him your business.<br />6. google it if you can&#039;t find your answers already posted on the forum.<br /><br /><br />I hope that all made sense, cause I am tripping balls at the moment, and thought it would be fun to log in and help a bit!<br /><br /><br />peace<br />18kct
