				Hey guys,<br /><br />Just wanted to some thoughts/advice. I&#039;m a new vendor. I&#039;ve had a few orders. Out of 8 orders, only 4 have finalized. The thing is, by the DCNs of each order, I can clearly see that package has been delivered. I&#039;m currently with several hundred dollars in escrow. What I&#039;m wondering is - is this normal?<br /><br />I know people get busy, but it sucks to not be able to re-up...

				Some people just don&#039;t think of Silk Road when their package arrives, they be too busy using it.. <br />After 17 days the system auto-finalizes for them.. It&#039;s annoying to wait, but at least you will get the money. Just takes some patience :)

He did not send enough information for me to ship his package so I dropped him a message asking for the rest of the info I needed to ship. He has not logged in and read the message yet. I figure Ill give him tell day 14 then cancel his order for not responding.<br /><br />

				I have to agree with you guys as well. How hard is it to Finalize an order. It really irks me when buyers are too lazy to log on and Finalize their orders, especially when it reflects badly on us buyers who do the right thing.

				If a buyer doesn&#039;t finalize after receiving, refuse to do business with them again. I&#039;m a regular buyer, and I also finalize when I receive it. It&#039;s a matter of common courtesy to the guy that just took a huge risk sending you an awesome package. Unless there&#039;s extenuating circumstances, finalizing on time shouldn&#039;t be a big deal. There was exactly one time I had to finalize two days late, and I had messaged the vendor before to let him know that I would probably be late due to a computer problem. Come on people.

				The longer you are hear and the more transactions you do the more respect people have for you. In the beginning people piss you around a lot but as you go on this happens less and less. I find that people are usually extremely prompt with finalizing for me but I think that&#039;s probably to do with how I come off on here as well. <br /><br />Either way it will get better the more rep you get.

A buyer bought for 15$ of my stuff domestically and after 7 days i have messaged him to know if there is any problem with his order but got no answer at all.. It&#039;s been 2 weeks now and all other buyers have received/finalized their orders with no problem. Hopefully i will get my money in 3 days but this is annoying as fuck..

You counter then with 0 days and ask them to explain what the issue is... They then do not log back in and check so you have to wait an extra 4 days for the resolution to time out.<br /><br />

				wow, this makes me rethink becoming a vendor. I&#039;ve have to fe as a new buyer, i dont see how a new vendor cant ask for good faith fe of say half. I would be unable to do any larger shipments that would save a buyer money if they cant at least finalize early on half?

				skhai, new vendors can not ask anyone to FE. You have to have 35 sales and 1month as a vendor before you can even ask people to FE and asking or requiring in most instances is frowned upon.

Totally agree. There seems to be quite a few members lately, expressing a desire to jump in and become a vendor on a shoe string budget with literally no concept of the COSTS, time or effort involved to get your operation up and running. Effectively, it&#039;s run as a business would be IRL, where you have to outlay a shitload to set it all up and get it running. Then, on top of that, have some coins put away for an emergency or those dreaded &quot;rainy days&quot;.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				RE: Buyers not finalizing.<br />Regarding this, the first thing I do after the postbox is unpack it, inspect it, hop on the here and go to Finalize. It&#039;s the least I can do when the <br />vendor has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure I received my product, which most vendors do. <br />I&#039;ve been lucky, so far, but it ran out I think. Almost 2 weeks ago, Frank Lucas, who I know well to be c63amg(or sumthin), was selling cheap 0.2 samples. I bought 2, maybe he was trying to rise from the ashes with a great batch and start anew. I&#039;ve had my SR support PM asking me to finalise or resolve. Now, I&#039;d much rather resolve peronally but after three attempts on SR and a couple of comments in the forums-nothing.<br />&nbsp; What if I resolve, and it turns up on tuesday or something? If he hasnt answered by the time i log on tommorrow, being differnet timezones &amp; shit, I&#039;m going to have to resolve, I just dont want a blemish against my name over such a petty order. Maybe he&#039;s counting on this. A few dozen not getting their cheap samples, not wanting a refund on their stats would be a nice little windfall. I ended up raving a bit there, but I hope you got a bit of it.lol<br />HM<br />

				Hey I feel the pain here, but it can also suck on the buying side.<br /><br />The only high quality source of K I can find requires finalizing early, forever, since I&#039;m in the US.&nbsp; Another US vendor requires it and I can&#039;t see any trusted buyer exceptions for when that happens.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I&#039;m stuck here reading stories about Tony76.

Come on people.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i love this entire quote. it should be laser engraved into precious italian marble or 24 karat gold. sized 20 ft x 60 ft, surrounded by a diamond crusted frame and displayed under neon lighting on the walls of Queen Elizabeth&#039;s tea room. it&#039;s that perfectly put.<br /><br />seriously these rodents lowlifes are disgustingly selfish. how can someone SHIT on someone&#039;s hard work and effort to SERVICE and provide good for them?<br />it seriously gives bad names to us responsible, &quot;distinguished junkies&quot;. at least be a junkie with integrity and basic decency not to ROB people of their livelihood. <br />yes the general stigma proves the typical junkie is a thieving soulless scoundrel that will sell his mother&#039;s wrist for a fix, but that is not us.<br />here on SR we are a unique well-bred, noble breed of sophistacted junkie, defying all logic. we have to maintain the MUTUAL RESPECT and courtesy between vendor and buyer. <br />unfortunately there will always be pieces of shits trying to run cons and scam. whether it&#039;s on SR, or in the streets. in the streets at least we&#039;re able to toss heavy bricks directly into their CHINS for some sense of relief, but here we can try something else. <br />as mentioned before, IMO the proper &quot;punishment&quot; these cockroaches truly deserve would be to log and list not only their usernames but also their names and addresses into this vendor&#039;s blacklist. that way no matter how many times they try to register with new usernames, their addresses and names will be permanently BLACKLISTED and banned. <br />we HAVE to maintain the mutual respect between vendor and buyer. we are a special unique breed of drug users defying the stigma and logic that all drug users will con ad steal when given the chance.<br />the &quot;punishment&quot; these roaches deserve is for their names, and addresses (maybe slightly masked, but still recognizable) to be completely blacklisted and banned on the vendor forums&#039;s list of shitfaces to avoid ever doing business with.&nbsp; even if they register a new SR account their address will be on this list to truly keep these shameless cockroaches away from our loving community of good hearted drug users.<br /><br />so OP, just spread the word on the vendor&#039;s forum and anyway, SR will fix the issue for you if it hasn&#039;t already been dealt with.

				I had a message from a buyer about his order and when i replied i mentioned that he hadn&#039;t finalized yet despite receiving his order. The buyer replied asking me what I meant by finalizing!! <br />He actually didn&#039;t know he had to finalize, I&#039;m still trying to figure out how he learned to use a computer :)<br />

I&#039;m a new vendor. I&#039;ve had a few orders. Out of 8 orders, only 4 have finalized. The thing is, by the DCNs of each order, I can clearly see that package has been delivered. I&#039;m currently with several hundred dollars in escrow.

				sure did take issue with the comment of becoming a vendor on a shoestring budget. If you wanna be the Walmart of drugs, and act all capitalistic, why be on SR? Besides quality of some small growers is usually so much better than large growers, and less need to cut than on the street, anonymity and loyalty-not to mention&nbsp; A+ trims and possibly more careful (time consuming) pkging.&nbsp; As well as probable better customer service. That&#039;s fine, corporate SR vendors, i would rather deal with a newer vendor who can only provide small amts due to these policies, but gives me a great deal and excellent connoisseur Cannabis Cup quality and polite, helpful and courteous service...guess I&#039;d prefer these mom and pop type vendors, just tryna make an honest living in a community cuttin&#039; their personal profits down to compete w/ the big boys.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see how smaller vendors and buyers fare with some of the new options of 35 transactions w/o fe, stealth vendors not open to small vendors...but i digress o.t.

Just tick the box around the description page.<br /><br />Seems to me like there&#039;s more than enough space on SR for everyone. If people want a Starfucks, they&#039;ll go to a Starfucks... If they want to go a smaller vendor then they can choose to?<br /><br />If the service/product is good, then size is secondary no? As long as people have a loose concept of the infrastructure behind the vendor then they can make more educated choices. Of course there are other forces at play, space taken up yaddda yadda.
