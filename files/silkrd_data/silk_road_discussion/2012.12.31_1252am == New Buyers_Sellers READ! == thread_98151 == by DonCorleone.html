I did nothing wrong and your spamming my shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sorry, what business? There isn&#039;t a business here.<br /><br />Fuck off until you have a business and stop spamming the boards with your bullshit. No account, no business, no one is spamming your shit, and you&#039;re not running anything by a hype-train.<br /><br />Given the recent scam that just ended, I&#039;m actually more likely to think that you are a scammer just the same, hiding behind a name that was at one time well-received. Given that there is no more DonCorleone selling... why is that? Why would a legitimate vendor lose their vending privileges and be unable to get them back? Unless they had been scamming...
