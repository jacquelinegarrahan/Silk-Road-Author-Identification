				Are there actually any habitual drug users on SR? I mean like actual smack heads or coke addicts or meth addicts? It seems unlikely considering these users would go through a hell of a lot of the product and the price on the road is anything up to 50% more expensive than street prices.. It seems that they would just use their IRL contacts to get this and leave SR to trying new harder to get things. It seems like the vast majority of SR now, is just for people with no IRL contacts or people that want to experiment with things they cant get locally.-. Or maby I´m wrong and some addicts value the anonymity and safety at 50% the cost of the drug. Would be interesting to know. Also It would be good to know if competition actually is a factor in stamping down prices.. or weather there are´nt enough serious venders yet. <br />ACE

				Check out the heroin thread in the Rumor Mill. There are a few users there who are certainly opiate addicts. They write about going through withdrawals when a vendor is late shipping (common), having to pawn stuff (less common), things like that.<br /><br />Others write about life before SR: having to drive two hours to a big city to score on the street, driving around the corner to do a tester to see if it&#039;s any good before going back to buy more, even having to stick the drugs up their asses (&quot;because you KNOW you&#039;re gonna get pulled over.&quot;) Definitely some of the most interesting reading in the forums.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong though- the majority of the regulars seem to have it together, and a few of them seem to be middle-aged or older with money to burn.<br /><br />In closing, my favorite SR review ever, of Nod&#039;s black tar heroin: &quot;Ordered last night, came home today during my lunch break to find it waiting for me. Now to play 18 holes of golf and drool on myself. God bless America&quot;

				In my case, I don&#039;t have any RL contacts except for weed which I no longer enjoy.<br /><br />I&#039;m more of a benzo guy and also like painkillers. I make sure that I regularly go without for a few days so that if I&#039;m unable to score, I won&#039;t have to go through withdrawal.

				There are. I was in a thread once defending the prices of opiates on SR. The addicts there felt it was too high and that by me paying the asked prices, I was &quot;hurting the SR experience&quot; for others.<br /><br /><br />Junkie logic ftw
