				A number of users have been reporting that attempts to visit the pages of presumably reputable vendors results in just seeing the Silk Road messaging interface.<br /><br />This would suggest that the vendor accounts have either been suspended whilst Silk Road Administrators conduct an investigation into reports of scamming (Silk Road suspends a vendor account when X amount of reports from different users are made to ensure that a potential scam cannot continue, even if there is no scam taking place), or the recent site updates introduced a bug that is causing problems with vendor accounts.<br /><br />I can&#039;t say for sure what&#039;s happening in your case but if you message Support they&#039;ll let you know if you are under investigation or not, and hopefully have the situation sorted out as soon as possible.<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, you have always come across as professional and legitimate in anything I&#039;ve seen you post here.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br />

				joolz - <br /><br />I don&#039;t have any information about this decision, but what I *DO* know is that admin look into these things very closely and if a vendor has not been banned after several reports, then it&#039;s likely because the admin couldn&#039;t find any solid proof that the vendor was scamming.&nbsp; On the other side of things, if a vendor is banned, then that is because SR found something that they deemed ban-worthy.&nbsp; There are two sides to every story, and Support does not ban people on a whim.

Some international vendors probably get mistaken as scammers because their products get seized. You never know though. You just haveto trust a vendor.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As mentioned previously I was 100% 5/5.&nbsp; There wasn&#039;t one single complaint in the 6 months I was a vendor.&nbsp; Not one.<br />It&#039;s hard to say, scout.&nbsp; I want to agree, but then again I never saw any evidence of my wrongdoing.&nbsp; Anyways, the decision is rendered and reaffirmed so I&#039;m not pressing any harder.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well that&#039;s a bit worrying for me... I also have a 100 rating (230 5/5&#039;s and 1 4/5 because it took 10 days to arrive). <br />Seems unfair that your account would just be suspended :-/ I&#039;d be very disappointed if my account got deleted. I have put a lot of time and effort into making sure every customer is happy to maintain my 100 rating. If it got deleted I&#039;d have to start from scratch and rebuild my reputation.<br /><br />Do you think you&#039;ll create a new vendor account? Good luck to you anyway.<br /><br />Dingo<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />PGP and PMs will bring new light to the matter.&nbsp; Let&#039;s just say I&#039;ve been lurking here a lot longer than I&#039;ve actually been a vendor ;)
