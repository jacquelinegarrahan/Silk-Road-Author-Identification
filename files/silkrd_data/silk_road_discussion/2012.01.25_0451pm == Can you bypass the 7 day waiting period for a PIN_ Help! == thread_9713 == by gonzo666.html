				I haven&#039;t bought anything in a month, and I never had to use a pin before, so I obviously forgot mine; SR support says I have to wait seven days to reply to the message b/4 I can get a new pin???&nbsp; Why???&nbsp; I wanted to place an order today.&nbsp; When did they start requiring a PIN?&nbsp; Is there any way to get the money out of my account before the seven days??&nbsp; Bitcoins are going down, and I don&#039;t have enough Bitcoins to even get what I planned on purchasing anymore unless the price goes back down a bit while bitcoins go back up.&nbsp; Furthermore, I need to re-up, and I don&#039;t have a seven day supply right now; this is really costing me, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

				Hi<br /><br />It&#039;s the secondary password rather than a number, so the term PIN does make it confusing.

				I have waited the 7 days and have been trying for 2days to reset my pin.&nbsp; &nbsp;No Response from SR. I have sent them 3 messages and wasted a lot of time logging in and checking if they have responded.&nbsp; Nothing!&nbsp; &nbsp;this really sucks.

				God you guys. I&#039;ve seen countless threads about this problem. It is YOUR fault for not remembering the password you set yourself. Next time WRITE IT DOWN and keep it in a safe place so you don&#039;t have to memorize it. This is a preventive measure for scammers and it is a GOOD one.

Stress is bad for your health. I know I would be pissed if this happened to me cause in 7 days I would of had my drugs already! Unfortunately all you can do is wait, bitching about it won&#039;t do anything.

				It takes about 3 days, go ahead and do your five bad tries, then respond ASAP to Silks message. In another day you will get message 2. Respond to it ASAP. Then on day 3 if you are as lucky as i was you will have to set a pin when you log in! Yay. I placed an order last month for new years and when i did it said something about a pin but i thought i would do it later, i didn&#039;t make another purchase for awhile and when i did i like many others was locked out and this was AFTER i had transferred my btc. Oh well, i am thankful for Silk Road and i will go without certain party favors this week end but it is all good. Thank you Silk!

				been in this PIN limbo for about a week now with money burning up my account and no way to spend it....<br /><br />the messed up thing is I don&#039;t recall ever setting a pin or second password... I always use the same codes and passwords among my password vocabulary so for me to forget one is hard to believe.<br /><br />gonna log out and log back in... again and again and again... uhhggg
