				I assumed they would be back up today. That&#039;s what the site says anyway. I am just waiting for them to come back up. I only mess with peanuts though. However. The price of btc is up nearly 7 USD, from the last time I purchased them.

				I have been a loyal bitinstant customer for many months. Since their recent meltdown, my coin research was lacking and I needed coins on the fly. I took a chance on&nbsp; SR vendor &quot;collapses&quot; and have nothing but positive feedback. The fees may be higher than some of the other bank branch deposit methods, but with no Wells Fargo or BOA in my area, my coin options just got much thinner. Paid 12% fee to the vendor and $12 fee to Western Union. I&#039;ve paid less, but I had my coins in about 90 minutes when it was urgent.

				Funds hit bitfloor account approximately one hour after deposit.&nbsp; Bought bitcoins immediately and sent them along to a stand alone wallet.&nbsp; Only &quot;complaint&quot; I&#039;d mention is the prices on Bitfloor for BTC where a buck or two higher than MtGox but with btc&#039;s steadily rising not really a big deal, imo.&nbsp; &nbsp; Bitinstant is dead long live the new king Bitfloor.&nbsp;

				Awesome Info +1<br /><br />couple questions:<br /><br />1. did they require a state ID?<br /><br />2. Does BitFloor have a way to automatically buy BTC&#039;s built in right, i dont want to send it to some off site for the BTC purchases.<br /><br />3. Once i have my BTC&#039;s in my BitFloor account i scan send them to whatever wallet i choose?<br /><br />4.&nbsp; All this for like 5 bucks more?<br /><br />5. Can u make $1000 plus deposits without getting taxed every $500<br /><br />6. You said about 1 hour deposit time?<br /><br /><br />I know u might not be able to answer them all but if someone could help.... fucking bitinstant sucks a fat one right when i have money.

				No id required.&nbsp; Asked teller for out of state deposit slip and then proceeded to fill in name, account # and amounts only.<br /><br />Bitfloor has a built in exchange to buy your btc&#039;s.<br /><br />I saw no limitations on which wallet you can use.<br /><br />Fee&#039;s were less for transaction but price of Btc was higher than listed on MtGox so pretty much a wash, plus I&#039;m assuming Btc to continue to rise at least in the short term.<br /><br />No idea on the limits.<br /><br />My funds were in my bitfloor account about an hour after depositing.<br />Yeah I gave bitinstant all weekend and figured I&#039;d get some on Monday alas they failed so today I took the plunge and had a very pleasant first experience with Bitfloor.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend them to anyone.&nbsp;

				So it looks as BitInstant is up, but i don&#039;t like how you have to pay 3.99 for every $500.&nbsp; Now say i need to deposit $1200, should i use BitFloor because there is only a transaction fee and no specific limit fee?

				Buying bitcoins may not be illegal, but buying drugs with them is.&nbsp; And how many people are buying BTC&#039;s for their groceries.&nbsp; Not to mention it&#039;s also a great way to launder money for gambling.&nbsp; I personally and could care less, but giving a 100% government ID is just ASKING to red flag yourself as a BTC purchaser.<br /><br />Not trying to spread panic...just i completely disagree with the 100% ID factor, peace and safety brother.

				OK i think you are misunderstanding my questions.<br /><br /><br />1.&nbsp; Mt.Gox charger 3.99 for every $500 USD deposited.&nbsp; Which is some crap IMO because they ALSO take a percentage e of the amount deposited.&nbsp; Does BitFloor have stupid fees for more than deposits of $500?<br /><br />2.&nbsp; When i set up a bank statement for BitFloor, i said i would deposit 1200 and the charge was 10 bucks.... totally 1210.&nbsp; Just some number i used to test.&nbsp; Now when i make that payment am i gonna have 1200 smackaroos in my bitfloor account to buy BTC&quot;S with and do as i please?<br /><br />3.

				Pretty much, and being able to cash deposit at a bank is so much more convenient. I don&#039;t think the trade charges are that much different, don&#039;t remember what mt.gox was charging. With bitinstant they were getting you with the 3% fee and the $4 moneygram fee, it adds up.

				Okay so now it&#039;s been about 7 days since I originally deposited cash for Bitcoins, and there are still no Bitcoins received from BitInstant / Coinapult.&nbsp; I brought up the issue on the /r/bitcoin subreddit and one of their staff said he&#039;d help with my issue.&nbsp; That was almost 24 hours ago and still no response either from him nor Coinapult (who I emailed).<br /><br />The sad thing is that, at this point, these delays have cost me hundreds of dollars because a.) exchange rate fluctuations and b.) now I have to order a smaller amount which means higher $ / gram (ie not bulk price).&nbsp; The silver lining is that I used BitFloor for two transactions since then and both were executed flawlessly so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they are my new go-to in lieu of BitInstant.<br /><br />I feel like I am watching BitInstant&#039;s death throes right now.

				bitfloor is more expensive than bitinstant due to the difference in exchange rates. bitfloor is trading at $3 higher than the price on the road so you lose $3 for every coin plus the 2% fee. Anything above $1 difference in rates amounts to bitfloor costing more than bitinstant.

If you make a Market Order then you pay market price for coins, if you make a Limit Order you set the price you want to pay. Sounds like you did a Market order and payed the weighted average which is usually around $3 higher than the lowest price. For my $100 cash deposit I got $96 worth of BTC into my SR wallet, that includes all the fees. With Bitinstant--Mtgox that would have been $92 after fees.

				With the nature of all this. I use bitinstant still, to mtgox. I just got a little over a coin yesterday. No matter how many I get off bitinstant, it is always 3.99 usd for their processing fee. I find that very doable with the entity we are dealing with eere. It is a small price to pay, for the simple fact I can pick and choose out of any drug I want. Obviously I would be more worried about it if I were dealing with more coins. Still if you are dropping 300-1,000 usd on some coins, to use here. Kind of hard to bitch about the surcharge. <br /><br />This has only been an opinion

				Hi all. Just thought I would toss out there that BitInstant seems to be back and running again. Did a cash deposit to bitcoin wallet address through their ZipZap MoneyGram deal and got the coin. Took longer than usual, about 4-5 hours to process, but it got there all right.<br /><br />Also, not sure that I can declare it a perfect alternative, but I used Bitcopia for a couple of transactions through Well Fargo cash deposits and they both came through wonderfully. It&#039;s a smaller operation but the guy who is running it seems to be on his game. Did one smaller transaction and then another larger one and they were both funded much faster than BitInstant.<br /><br />I also did one transaction through a vendor using MoneyGram and that went perfectly well too. The vendor is just getting setup to sell coins so I won&#039;t name names until they are all set to do volume but at least it&#039;s nice to know most everyone I&#039;ve delt with selling coins so far has eventually got them to me. When BitInstant went down I was more than a little stressed. I love how easy they make things and the fact that they LOOK like a real functioning business even if they are sort of small and still probably going through some growing pains.

				I know bitinstant has had their issues earlier this month, but. The biggest wait I have when I use bitinstant. Is getting them on the SR, just because it takes them a an hour so to verify. bitinstant+mtgox+offline wallet+blockchain = 15 mins+(SRx1hr+)

I can order and go to a local store that is 5 mins away, have them in mtgox by the time I get home. With all the problems I have seen people having. 3.99 usd is a convenience I will pay for. This does not mean you&#039;re not on point. I only been at this a month or so, and it has worked every single time. I even grab a couple extra moneygrams so that when I order them I put all my fake information down so when I get there. I just had them muh loot and I am on my way. <br /><br />Again, not taking away credit from yea or anything. For me though...if it&#039;s not broke, don&#039;t break it. =) Perhaps when I get more familiar with getting btc I will give myself more options. I am in a remote part of the US so yeah. This works, for me! I never imply for anyone to do as I do. I make my own bed.

				Bitinstant has been unbelievable unreliable the last month or so. When available I use Blue Sky Traders, but they aren&#039;t always trading.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve found as a viable Bitinstant replace is Ziggap. (no, not ZipZap, Ziggap)<br />***clearnet*** <br /><br />www.ziggap.com<br /><br />***cleanet***<br /><br />Originally you didn&#039;t need a membership. Now it makes you sign up, but I just filled it full of false information and was good to go. It&#039;s different in Bitinstant in that instead of &quot;Making a Payment&quot; your &quot;Sending Money&quot; assuming you use MoneyGram (why wouldn&#039;t you? it&#039;s the most anonymous way...Especially at Walmart where they NEVER ID you!) Ziggap picks orders up twice a day, so your coins are likely to be deposited the same day. They also have a live chat feature that is actually helpful and competent. One downside is that it is just little more expensive than Bitinstant, but it&#039;s in the same ballpark.<br />

				My last BitInstant transaction was about a week ago. It was Bitcoin to address (I sent them straight to my SR account) and everything went very smoothly. It took probably about 3 hours for the coins to show up in my SR wallet after I made the moneygram payment.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had any issues with bitinstant, so it&#039;s unfortunate that so many aren&#039;t getting the same experience that I have been.

If you are like me though, waiting hours or days for them to sort stuff out sucks as you watch the price of Bitcoins go up and down. I feel like I am gambling until the moment I place my order. Hopefully everyone keeps this thread current with the best options as things sort themselves out.

				If you are in a metro area and not rural, get on craigslist, trade bitcoins in person for cash, you will likely pay over spot though. There are plenty of people selling them on ebay too, even BMR has an exchange service in beta testing now!

Anything above $1 difference in rates amounts to bitfloor costing more than bitinstant.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s not accurate, you can set what price you want to pay on Bitfloor. If you make a Market Order then you pay market price for coins, if you make a Limit Order you set the price you want to pay. Sounds like you did a Market order and payed the weighted average which is usually around $3 higher than the lowest price. For my $100 cash deposit I got $96 worth of BTC into my SR wallet, that includes all the fees. With Bitinstant--Mtgox that would have been $92 after fees.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t fully understand this.&nbsp; Does it take longer to get your BTC if you do Limit Order for lower than the weighted average?&nbsp; My order via Market Order went a lot fast than my (currently processing) Limit Order.&nbsp; Anyone who can chime in on this?

				yes i did a market order because if i did a limit order it wouldnt have went through due to the constantly rising price of the coins, it would just sit until the rate matched the price i was buying at

				I&#039;m popping in to re-iterate a few other people and recommend CryptoCurrent. Honestly, just try it once, you&#039;ll never want to use Bitinstant again. This is the simple, secure method we&#039;ve all been waiting for. The fee is only 1% higher than what Bitinstant charges... You&#039;re crazy if you&#039;re not on it.

				I also support CryptoCurrent ... We had a disagreement earlier in the week that we were able to get worked out, so my support goes back to where it was prior to the issue ... high !
