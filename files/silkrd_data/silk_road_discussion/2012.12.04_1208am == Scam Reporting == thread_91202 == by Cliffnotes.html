				Does it help me at all to report a scam? Like will i be refunded or will the scammer just have a report against him and be known as a scammer?? Because, I made a bitcoin purchase through moneypak that is taking too long. The payment has been processing since 11 pm central yesterday. I mailed him and told him i would give him until 10 or 11 tonight. What should I do? And stupid moneypak people won&#039;t check the balances of moneypaks unless you have a green dot visa card which is stupid. They let you load ,money onto your moneypak but wont let you check the balance unless you use it. I can check to see if he took the money but I have to transfer the funds onto my paypal account and i could probably be reported for scamming if he try&#039;s to do the transaction and the moneypak has no money on it. Any suggestions??

				*Update*<br /><br />He cleaned out $295 off my moneypak card and will not accept the order. Do I have any chance of recovering anything? The guy has a 100% transaction success with 75 transactions, so I didn&#039;t just select a random guy to order from. I messaged him but he won&#039;t reply. This is his vender account page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/17b07001ab. I reported him, but will it do any good since he wont accept the order I sent him?
